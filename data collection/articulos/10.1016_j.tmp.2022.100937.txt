                  This research aims at exploring and interpreting critically the impacts of tourism on Amsterdam Pride festival in the context of gender equality (SDG 5) and responsible consumption (SDG 12) based on the perceptions and meaning-makings of tourists/visitors attending the Amsterdam Pride. Drawing on 40 in-depth interviews with LGBTQ+ participants supported by participant observation during the event to ensure data triangulation for reflexive inquiry, an inductive thematic content analysis was conducted. The findings highlight that Pride from past to present has been undergoing a major transformation from political and grassroots movements towards a more commercial and an entertainment activity as a new field of agency whose ‘fun’ is also political. This research also contributes to the understanding of gender equality (SDG 5) through considering sexual and gender identity minorities that are not highlighted in SDGs.

10.1016/j.tmp.2022.100937   Table 1 Critical Approaches to Gay Tourism and LGBTQ+/Pride Festivals.  Table 1   LGBTQ+ Festivals Tourism affects LGBTQ+ pride. Within tourism, the LGBTQ+ pride turns to the festival and takes place as a party. Thus the main focus is becoming entertainment  (Enguix, 2017  ; Johnston, 2005  ; Rushbook, 2005  ), and they move away from the political focus  (Hughes, 2006b  ). The number of heterosexual tourists is increasing day by day, so LGBTQ+ individuals are prevented from expressing themselves. This leads to the assimilation of movement  (Abrahamson, 2014  ; Taylor, 2014  ). LGBTQ+ festivals are marketed as tourism attractions; they focus mainly on the celebration, so they lose their meaning about the reason for being. Thus, they are not political with consumption  no longer (Chasin, 2000a  ; Sender, 2004  ).  Sponsors' and companies' show economic force  (Kates, 2003  ; Kates & Belk, 2001  ; Markwell & Waitt, 2009  ; Wolf, 2009  ). Because they aim to promote their brand and get support from the community, it occurs as a public relations activity  (Markwell & Waitt, 2009  ) of these companies.  LGBTQ+ festivals try to direct the LGBTQ+ community to consumption as a tourism attraction. They desire white western gay identity as educated, wealthy and bourgeois and beefcake body image in activities, magazines and banners. Thus, the commodification of sexual orientations and gender identity emerge  (Wolf, 2009  ). Moreover, this western gay identity and body image become consumption bodies  as these individuals' lives are becoming the focus of consumption (Enguix, 2017  ).  LGBTQ+ festivals create homonormative gay culture as part of neoliberalism. They build especially white western gay identity. Accordingly, gays are considered economically strong and travel most as not having heteronormative family order. Hence, festivals cause segregation in the LGBTQ+ community  (Ammaturo, 2016 ) and reproduction of hegemonies  (Johnston, 2005  ). Transexual and lesbian individuals are viewed as abnormal and marginal  (Graham, 2002  ; Waitt & Markwell, 2014  ).  LGBTQ+festivals can deepen the discrimination between LGBTQ+/heterosexual individuals. The LGBTQ+ bodies who participate and perform in the festival are gazed by heterosexual and hierarchical views  (Blichfeldt, Chor, & Ballegaard-Milan, 2013 ). This also creates physical and social boundaries  between the gazed bodies (who are watched during the festival) and bodies who look (see also Johnston, 2001  ).

The findings highlight that Pride from past to present has been undergoing a major transformation from political and grassroots movements towards a more commercial and an entertainment activity as a new field of agency whose ‘fun’ is also political. This research also contributes to the understanding of gender equality (SDG 5 ) through considering sexual and gender identity minorities that are not highlighted in SDGs.   Keywords Festival and event  Amsterdam Pride  LGBTQ+  Diversity and inclusion  Responsible consumption  Gender equality  Queer  Sexual orientation and gender identity    1 Introduction Since the roots of the Gay Liberation Movement and the Stonewall uprising, the struggle of LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and related identities) rights has transformed from social movement to global tourism event (World Tourism Organization, 2017 ). Nowadays, pride festivals are one of the well-known festivals across the world, which have attracted millions of people each year and have considerable economic gains to the destinations (InterPride, 2016 ; Waitt, Markwell, & Gorman-Murray, 2008 ). Many countries and destinations around the world position themselves as gay or LGBTQ+ friendly. The tourism and hospitality sector views LGBTQ+ individuals, especially the ‘educated’, ‘white’, ‘wealthy’ and ‘bourgeois’ gays – as a consumption group generally attending pride festivals, attracted to gay-friendly bars or clubs (Diekmann & Smith, 2015 ). Cities supporting LGBTQ+ rights such as Amsterdam, Stockholm, and Copenhagen give particular importance to LGBTQ+ individuals in tourism marketing (such as Amsterdam Marketing) with the effect of the “pink economy” (Vorobjovas-Pinta & Hardy, 2015  , p. 410–411). This situation causes a paradoxical structure while the mainstream attitude of the sector, which seems to support LGBTQ+ rights but also degrades LGBTQ+ individuals to a consumption market, normalizes gayness under the influence of neoliberal policies and creates a hierarchy among LGBTQ+ individuals (Waitt et al., 2008  ). Such a paradoxical nature of pride festivals brings along some critical questions: Has the movement's focus shifted to festival and tourism as if there has been significant progress in LGBTQ+ lives worth celebrating? Is the festival itself political fun? Events and festivals are sites embedded in various social interactions, performativity, and power dynamics. Particularly, pride festivals have been subject to the recent scholarly inquiry over the last two decades (Browne, 2007 , 2009  ; Hughes, 2006a, 2006b ; Johnston & Waitt, 2015 ; Markwell & Waitt, 2009  ; Ong, Lewis, & Vorobjovas-Pinta, 2021  ; Waitt & Gorman-Murray, 2008 , 2011  ). Unlike previous studies on LGBTQ+ events held in the Anglo-Saxon contexts such as Australia and the USA (Johnston, 2001  ; Kates, 2003  ; Markwell, 2002  ; Markwell & Waitt, 2009  ), we know relatively little about LGBTQ+ events held in Europe. Thus, the fieldwork in this paper was conducted in Amsterdam, which organizes one of the most well-known pride festivals annually. Amsterdam Pride assumes sociological, political, and economic significance as a place that adapts, reconstructs, and stages the narratives of the LGBTQ+ community for the world. Amsterdam Pride represents a unique, authentic and transgressive experience for LGBTQ+ tourists because they are able to live their sexual identities openly and express themselves freely in accordance with their wishes and decisions in a safe and unrestricted environment. At the festival, a community sharing a set of common aims, ideals and interests find a middle ground where distinct fields of expression are created during a certain time and at a certain venue; where various products are presented; and entertainment opportunities are offered. This makes Amsterdam Pride attractive for LGBTQ+ tourists, and the event, by its very nature, transforms into a tourism practice. Pride festivals are crucial for the LGBTQ+ movement since it helps to gain “social capital” (Putnam, 2000  ). This capital provides a bridge between the LGBTQ+ community and the broader society by creating a sense of individual identity (Tilly, 2005  ). Furthermore, within the context of pride festivals, groups (both LGBTQ+ and supporters of the movement) want to demonstrate their strength in terms of being visible and proud. Thus, the festival helps groups raise their demands and voice their ignored existence regarding equality towards state and society (Holzhacker, 2012  ). Also, the pride festival includes marketing activities in which many companies sponsor that event, and the participants are the consumption group during the festival. For this reason, our research focuses on the contribution of Amsterdam Pride to both gender equality and responsible consumption that refers to “the continued act of controlling desire by avoiding extravagant purchases and rationalized use of goods and services that satisfy basic needs” (Quoquab & Mohammad, 2020  , p. 311). Furthermore, we argue that consumption should be responsible because the perspective of responsible consumption focuses on improving the quality of life for both individuals and society by considering human rights and social justice (Salonen, 2013  ). Thus, we can demonstrate the contribution of the Amsterdam Pride to the sustainable development goals of the United Nations (particularly SDG 5 and SDG 12). Given this brief description and background on pride festivals, the article aims at exploring and interpreting the impacts of tourism on Amsterdam Pride Festival in the context of responsible consumption (SDG 12) and gender equality (SDG 5) critically, drawing on the subjective lived experiences and meaning-makings of tourists/visitors attending the Amsterdam Pride. Thus, the paper problematises the issue of if gender equality is the missing link of sustainable development. (Stevens, 2010  ). As Boluk, Cavaliere, and Higgins-Desbiolles (2019)  also indicated, while SDG 5 is concerned with achieving gender equality, this is indeed essential for achieving all 17 SDGs. We strongly argue that the sexual orientation and gender identity issues should come into play in implementing, achieving and queering the SDGs in tourism while making SDG 5 more gender-inclusive. Since tourism scholars have paid little attention to the events and festivals by unpacking the sexual orientation and gender identity minority issues in the light of SDGs, this research contributes to this limited discussion through critically examining responsible consumption and gender equality under the SDGs (Alarcón & Cole, 2019 ; Boluk et al., 2019 ). Also, UN SDGs focus mainly on women based inclusionary practices such as increasing representation of them in the global tourism industry and empowering women in terms of authority and leadership (Robinson, Martins, Solnet, & Baum, 2019 ). For this reason, this research aims at extending the concept of gender equality by considering sexual and gender identity minorities that are not highlighted in SDGs. The article fills a gap in the mainstream festival and event management literature that does not address gender-based power dynamics. This can be partly explained by the resistance to adopt poststructuralist queer arguments and challenge the hetero-patriarchal order in the mainstream literature (Ferguson & Alarcón, 2015 ). In addressing the aforementioned gap in the literature and responding to several calls voiced in critical tourism scholarship (e.g. Figueroa-Domecq, Pritchard, Segovia-Pérez, Morgan, & Villacé-Molinero, 2015 ; Ong et al., 2021 ; Pritchard & Morgan, 2017  ; Reimer & Walter, 2013  ; Scheyvens, 2007  ), this paper contributes to a growing body of knowledge within mainstream festival and event management literature as an area considered largely to be “queer-blind”.  Even though SDG studies consider gender equality, they predominantly focus on white and heterosexual women (Nwangwu & Ezeibe, 2019  ; Struckmann, 2018  ). Such a limitation demonstrates a need to create a more inclusionary approach to understanding gender equality. For this reason, this paper focuses on the complex nature of gender-based as well as consumption-based relationships in the context of the Amsterdam Pride Festival. In the light of SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption), the research questions explored in this study are as follows: How do LGBTQ+ participants view Amsterdam Pride regarding body and consumption patterns? How do the commercialisation and commodification shape LGBTQ+ participants' experiences by considering the changing nature of Amsterdam Pride?  2 Literature review 2.1 Gay tourism and consumption Since the 1980s, the tourism sector has viewed, positioned and targeted LGBTQ+ individuals as consumption groups. During these years, with their growing visibility in the major urban centres and holiday destinations of North America and Western Europe, LGBT individuals soon became the tourism industry's focus. As a result, Europe and the United States became a favourite haunt of LGBTQ+ tourists through promotional activities, the development of products and services for LGBTQ+ individuals, and national and international cooperation (Second Global Report on LGBT Tourism, 2017). Binnie (2004 )  relates this to queer tourism, in which queer consumption is most visible and most dominant. In the tourism literature, the tourism mobility of LGBTQ+ individuals is conceptualized with different terms such as gay tourism, lesbian tourism, LGBT tourism, and queer tourism and centred around gay individuals, while gay tourism1  1 Gay tourism is used in some sources for both gay and lesbian tourists. During the literature review on LGBTQ+ tourism, no study was found that particularly focused on the tourism mobility of bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals. In this paper the term gay/gay tourism are used in the context which is used in the literature. Because the tourism market mainly prefers gay and gay tourism categorisation as it has focused primarily on the gay segment.   is the most common usage (Holcomb & Luongo, 1996 ; Pritchard, Morgan, & Sedgley, 1998 ; Waitt & Markwell, 2014  ). Gay tourists are particularly considered a niche market and defined by the positive economic impacts they bring to the destinations they travel to, such as Spain and Netherlands (Holcomb & Luongo, 1996 ; Pritchard et al., 1998  ; UNWTO, 2017 ). The perception that LGBTQ+ individuals are a consumption group has given rise to a new heteronormative myth called the pink economy that gays and lesbians are affluent and travel a lot (Badgett, 2001  ; Waitt & Gorman-Murray, 2011  ). This Western-centric myth creates a perception that LGBTQ+ gender identity and sexual orientation occur within certain performances (Padilla, 2007  ). Gay-friendly marketing emphasised in national tourism marketing strategies normalizes gayness through a gay identity created in accordance with heteronormativity within the framework of neoliberal policies (Waitt et al., 2008  ). Such a normalisation of physically healthy and “good” looking gay bodies creates sensitivities and concerns within the community. This situation paves the way for developing phobic behaviours and vulnerabilities against those who do not fit into these categories. In contrast to gays who experience gay-friendly organisations and destinations serving in the gay tourism market (as a consumption strategy), lesbian, bisexual and transgender tourists, for instance, encounter homophobic, biphobic and transphobic behaviour in many tourism organisations, especially in hotels (Enguix, 2017  ; Poria, 2006  ; Puar, 2002a, 2002b ). The LGBTQ+ market, in general, ostracises lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals and those with weak economic purchasing power within the community, thereby creating a market based on gender and class discrimination and presenting gays as a normal niche consumer group in some destinations (Chasin, 2000a  ; Enguix, 2017  ). This shows us how neoliberal policies shape the commodification of sexuality and transform the LGBTQ+ lifestyle into a consumerist activity (Wolf, 2009  ). According to Waitt et al. (2008 , p. 795) , this approach is not a negative but a wrong practice of the heteronormative order.  2.2 LGBTQ+ festivals and events As mega-events, LGBTQ+ festivals are a driving force in international LGBTQ+ tourism (Waitt & Markwell, 2014  ). As a community that organizes many events ranging from small parties to festivals, the LGBTQ+ community is no stranger to these events. LGBTQ+ festivals occupy a broad place in gay tourism and event/festival tourism and have an extremely important attraction for destinations (Waitt & Markwell, 2014  ). It can thus be said that pride festivals, which are the most visible and dynamic component of LGBTQ+ tourism (Southall & Fallon, 2011  ), are shaped within the framework of capitalism's hegemony of consumption (Kates & Belk, 2001  ). Contrary to their historical and political content, pride festivals have today been incorporated into the production-consumption system of tourism and entered into a process in which identity is constructed with a focus on consumption (Chasin, 2000b  ; Wolf, 2009  ). LGBTQ+ festivals have thus come to be among the major tourist attractions (Taylor, 2014  ). Furthermore, the promotion of festivals can affect the setting of festivals, even motivations of participants like in Michigan Womyn's Festival (Browne, 2009  ). Despite the availability of limited discussion on gender approaches, feminist scholarship and queer theorising of tourist studies, several recent works need to be highlighted in order to extend and enrich existing debates on Pride festivals. For instance, De Jong (2017)  problematises the nuanced ways and complex processes of how commodification occurs through various interactions by seeking to go beyond the uniform, simplistic critiques of the Mardi Gras festival, the largest Pride event in Australia. Hartal (2019 )  elucidates the political economy and neoliberal aspects of queer politics through normalisation, homonationalism and containment strategies of gay tourism in urban spaces in Tel-Aviv and the Tel-Aviv Pride Parade. Finally, Kenttamaa Squires (2019 )  unpacks the complexity of homonormativity in critical queer scholarship and addresses evidence of homonormativity on the Lesbian and Hispanic Pride that are intersectionally themed LGBT annual events in Miami Beach. The connection between pride festivals and tourism has stimulated some questioning and criticism. There are views that festivals have become commodified and assimilated, departed from their ideology, and lost their authenticity (Taylor, 2014  ). The concept of authenticity, which is used in tourism literature from different perspectives such as objective (MacCannell, 1999  ), constructive (Cohen, 2004  ), postmodern and existential authenticity (Wang, 1999  ), is an abstract, subjective and perceptual concept. Thus the meaning of the concept varies according to the perspective that it is related. In terms of LGBTQ+ festivals, it refers to an individual's search for her/his own being as existential authenticity (Wang, 1999  ). Pride festivals allow LGBTQ+ tourists to experience their own state of being in communitas that she/he encounters and feels a sense of unity (Kaygalak-Celebi, Kaya, Ozeren, & Gunlu-Kucukaltan, 2020 ). However, this type of authenticity is used for commercial purposes and creates new spaces and identities. As Hartal and Sasson-Levy (2021)  argue, neoliberalism and the politics of gay tourism marketing present Tel Aviv and local Mizrahi culture as exotic and different. By the time of progress in Tel Aviv, gay Mizrahi culture was perceived as authentic both by tourists and locals. Hence, the new type of the authentic self is questionable (Hartal & Sasson-Levy, 2021 ) as this search for authenticity is a symbolic, not concrete, search because of commodification (Garzian, 2011  ). Companies that sponsor pride festivals to sell their commodities to the LGBTQ+ market are the central target of these criticisms (Wolf, 2009  ). Markwell and Waitt (2009 )  argue that the change in pride festivals is an ideological transformation and due to financial sponsorships. Many large companies attempt exploitation using rainbow colours and use pride festivals as a show of economic strength (Kates, 2003  ; Kates & Belk, 2001  ; Wolf, 2009  ). This is especially cited as the reason for the commodification of pride festivals and the shift away from the struggle-and resistance-based focus since the 1990s (Chasin, 2000a  ). Table 1   presents the relevant criticisms in the literature. The studies in Table 1  reveal some critical results which are relevant for understanding tourism and commodification impacts on LGBTQ+ festivals/pride. Importantly, these critics mostly focus on problems such as moving away from the political focus, creating a separation between communities and deepening the separation outside community with the axis of neoliberal policies. However, while researchers have considered the impacts of the LGBTQ+ festivals/pride regarding tourism, consumption, and commodification, these aspects have not been thoroughly studied from the viewpoint of SDGs. Therefore, by interrogating Amsterdam Pride with the axis of changing nature of tourism, consumption and commodification patterns, we reconsider pride in the light of the SDGs framework. The literature review of this research demonstrates a dearth of research on queer approaches in tourism studies. Also, the criticism regarding pride events such as transforming from political focus to entertainment, assimilation of movement creates the need for understanding current perspectives of Pride participants about how consumption and tourism have an impact on Amsterdam Pride within the context of gender equality (SDG5) and responsible consumption (SDG12). In order to achieve the aforementioned aim, in the next section, we introduce the research method by considering research design, sampling, researcher positionalities, and methods of data analysis.   3 Research method 3.1 Research design The current study adopted a qualitative research design in order to gather a wide range of experiences of LGBTQ+ participants that may allow us to in-depth understand the social phenomenon under investigation. We seek to explore the question of whether Amsterdam Pride has transformed into an entertainment activity and a space of fun by serving the idea of the neoliberal consumption society linked to SDGs (particularly, gender equality and responsible consumption). Since we were concerned with the social side of pride festivals, a qualitative research approach could provide more interpretive aspects on the social dimensions of these festivals based on participants' lived experiences, thoughts, feelings, motivations and behaviour at the Pride event (Duffy & Mair, 2017  ; Getz & Page, 2016 ). We gathered data through in-depth interviews and participant observations. Semi-structured interview questions include the major reason and motivation of coming together, how participants see the festival and the transforming nature of the Pride from past to present. Data were collected between July 31st and August 7th on 2017. An average interview lasted nearly 55 min (min 30 and max 80 min). The total number of participants was 40. The 35 interviews were made in English, and only five were made in Turkish. 23 out of 40 were interviewed face-to-face during the Pride event. Six participants who accepted to be interviewed at first but were not interviewed during the Pride due to their availability were interviewed by Skype just after the Pride. The rest of 11 participants were communicated via Amsterdam Pride's official Facebook page, and their data were obtained by email. All audio recordings made during the interviews were transcribed verbatim. The age of participants surveyed in the study ranges from 18 to 68. 20 participants defined their gender identity as male, 16 participants defined their gender identity as female. One participant defined her gender identity as a trans woman, and the other one defined as a trans man. Additionally, one participant was non-binary, and the other one was queer. The detailed demographic information about research participants is presented in Table 2 in Annex (Appendix).  3.2 Sampling The study's sample size consists of 40 self-identified LGBTQ+ participants who attended the Amsterdam Pride in 2017. The sample size can be considered relatively high when taken into account the qualitative research paradigm (Creswell & Poth, 2018  ) and sexual and gender minority people as being relatively difficult to access. (Please see Table 2 in the Annex for further information about the participants). Firstly, we adopted criterion sampling as one of the purposeful sampling strategies in qualitative research tradition (Emmel, 2013  ; Palinkas et al., 2015  ; Patton, 2002  ). The criterion was utilized to distinguish festival visitors (either domestic or foreign tourists) from local people. In this respect, we only included tourists as participants rather than local people who voluntarily accepted to be interviewed, having been totally informed about the scope of the research. Secondly, we adopted snowball sampling to access other participants who generally attend the event with their friends and partners. The main limitation of the sample is not to have diverse age groups. For this reason, the number of senior participants is low. However, since we do not collect evidence from the field regarding the difference between previous and current LGBTQ+ events, age does not seem to be the primary factor within the context of this research. Nevertheless, future research can consider ageing issues and collect data from senior participants in comparing the current and previous LGBTQ+ events from a historical and critical perspective.  3.3 Researcher positionalities The first author identifies as a feminist, cisgender woman whose research interests mostly focus on tourism management, events/festivals, tourism guidance, authenticity in tourism and sustainable tourism. She was a PhD candidate during the data collection phase of the study2  2 This article is the final version of the work, which has been substantially improved, revised and extended after being presented as part of the PhD thesis by the first author.  , and this was the first time she attended Amsterdam Pride in person. The second author is a profeminist male scholar who has published widely on comparative and interdisciplinary aspects of gender, queer and LGBTIQ+ issues in organisations. His current research interests include equality, diversity, inclusion in the workplace, critical tourism research, social entrepreneurship and sustainability, sociology of tourism, and qualitative research methods. Finally, the third author identifies as a queer-friendly scholar who earned his PhD on LGBT NGOs in Turkey and Britain through institutional theory. His research areas include senior and minority studies in entrepreneurship, intersectionality and diversity management. The research team members paid particular attention to becoming self-reflective throughout the research process regarding how their own assumptions, self-identities and lived experiences have an impact on the way data was collected, analysed and interpreted. The first author spent time in the festival area and participated in activities such as Canal Parade in order to be a part of the experiential flow of the festival. Hence, she felt herself a natural part of the festival and tried to be close to the worlds of the group she wanted to explore. She clearly introduced herself and explained the scope of the interview. She mentioned that the data would be used only for academic purposes, and she got permission from each participant for the in-depth interview. She tried to eliminate the hesitations of the participants before the interview by creating a trustful atmosphere. She gave the nicknames for each participant during the planning phase of in-depth interviews and meeting with participants. Then, she connected to two independent researchers from the community to understand the context of the interviews, such as some words and jargon used by the community. We also employed the participant observation technique. The first author participated in the festival in person and observed the Canal Parade, one of the most spectacular events on the Amsterdam Pride. The participant observation, along with in-depth interviews, facilitated us in understanding participants' behavioural patterns and social interactions more accurately (Mackellar, 2013  , p. 60). The Canal Parade took place on 5 August 2017 with 80 boats representing 80 organisations, and the first author participated in the Parade in boat number 48. The informed consent of boat leaders had already been taken before the event as they invited her onto their boats when the day came. In the morning (around ten-thirty am), she met the boating community in Hannekes's Boom (Dijksgracht 4, Amsterdam) and was welcomed on board at twelve-thirty pm. The boat capacity was around 200 people. Indeed, each boat had a unique design style in line with its own theme. While the boats were passing through the canals of Amsterdam, there was a magnificent scene everywhere coloured with rainbow flags and were bodily performances by participants with music and a variety of costumes. The observed event lasted six-and-a-half hours, and she took several notes, pictures and videos with the informed consent of each participant.  3.4 Methods of data analysis We conducted an inductive thematic content analysis to arrive at critical and interpretive conclusions drawing on in-depth interviews as well as participant observation to ensure data triangulation for reflexive inquiry (Creswell, 2013  ). In the data analysis stage, we firstly performed pilot coding in the light of the research questions and coding frame. Then, we checked the consistency of the categories and subcategories shaped by the codes and discussed differently coded subcategories with our research team members who shared their individual, independent assessment. Next, we analysed and coded the interview transcripts multiple times by each author separately. Later on, the research team met several times to discuss the initial codes to decide about subcategories and themes. We revised the subcategories accordingly and arrived at a coding consistency of 90% (Schreier, 2012  , p. 147, Schreier, 2014 , p. 179). Indeed, utilising multiple coders is a commonly used technique to increase trustworthiness in qualitative research (Elo et al., 2014  ). At last, we generated final themes through one more discussion round by figuring out the common and emerging patterns across the entire data. Based on Corbin and Strauss (2015 )  three stages in qualitative data analysis that are ‘open coding’, ‘axial coding’ and ‘selective coding’, the data set was subject to inductive and thematic analysis supported by a critical and deconstructive approach (Gehman et al., 2018  ; Gioia, Corley, & Hamilton, 2013 ). The consent form, the semi-structured interview guide and the list of research themes and subcodes can be found in the Appendix.   4 Findings The research findings show that with globalisation, LGBTQ+ festivals have been transforming from a political movement to an entertainment arena with an increasing commercial prominence and thus present the transformations that the Amsterdam Pride Festival has so far undergone. Almost all participants reported that pride festivals, in general, and the Amsterdam Pride Festival, in particular, have evolved into a tourism event that takes place away from the original grassroots (the Stonewall uprising). This transformation led to questions among some participants and was viewed by some of them as a new field of the agency whose fun is also political. Although they had different perspectives, all participants criticised that gay tourists are downplayed as a consumer group during the festival. Participants' views are presented under the following two themes that are “A new conception of agency and fun: Its Fun is also Political!” and “The consuming subjects of the festival: Gay bodies.” 4.1 A new conception of agency and fun: its fun is also political! LGBTQ+ events that have undergone several historical and political transformations since the Stonewall uprising are now seen as the most important tourist attraction for destinations (Waitt & Markwell, 2014  ). The role that LGBTQ+ events play in the consumption practices of the neoliberal system is worth discussing in the critical tourism literature (Chasin, 2000a  ; Markwell & Waitt, 2009  ; Richardson, 2017  ; Sender, 2004  ). According to some participants, the sole purpose of the Pride was reduced to partying, entertainment and visual shows, and the event evolved into a tourism activity, thereby causing the movement to lose its political focus. However, tourism activities still have a critical role in providing visibility of specific issues such as gender equality (SDG 5) even though some participants expressed their concern about this issue as follows:I think it has turned into a very big tourism activity. But it has a downside. It seems like there is always parties and entertainment, but I do not think that should be the point. Looking from the outside in, it seems as if that were the point. In my opinion, it is getting more and more tourist-oriented. Angela, Heterosexual woman, 35  Pride, in its current form, unfortunately, cannot go beyond a mere festival and tourist activity with its events. It is a festival in the form of visual shows rather than a struggle by which LGBT issues in the Netherlands and around the world are brought to public attention. I think Amsterdam Pride no more aims to raise awareness. It is more of a festival, a feast, and a celebration. I also think that constitutionally vested rights are influential here. Of course, this has produced an adverse impact in recent years. For example, Amsterdam Pride has overlooked its political stand and become more of a tourist activity. This is because although there are constitutional rights, LGBT issues still persist in the Netherlands, including the big cities, as they do everywhere. Nancy, Heterosexual woman, 36   As it is understood from the remarks above, the participants feel uneasy about the appearance of the Pride as a festival focused on partying, entertainment and consumption and suggest that it has lost its spirit of social movement. They think that an event in a festive mood cannot have any meaning for LGBTQ+ rights and freedoms. Several other studies, albeit limited, have shown that researchers and interviewees have similar concerns about LGBTQ+ events (Hughes, 2006a  ; Hughes, 2006b  ; Johnston, 2005  ; Richardson, 2017  ). Nancy stated that LGBTQ+ issues other than the festival still persist in the Netherlands. A similar finding is also true for the ChillOut Festival. The festival places that defy or appear to challenge heteronormativity during the festival resume reproducing mainstream norms once the festival ends (Waitt & Gorman-Murray, 2011  ). All participants agreed on the idea that the Amsterdam Pride Festival has transformed from its political roots into a new form dominated by the theme of fun. However, some participants hold a positive view of this fun-oriented nature of the festival. The participants primarily emphasise the positive transformation of the social impacts of the Amsterdam Pride Festival on the lifestyles of LGBTQ+ individuals (Sharpley & Stone, 2012  : 349). The participants expressed their views as follows:In my opinion, it is positive that the festival has a commercial aspect because today I see commercialization as the best way to achieve the whole. Pride events are a very important tourist attraction. I saw lots of international and national tourists coming. I think with the tourism industry, Pride events have become popular and had sponsors. The message of Pride has spread widely. Alex, Gay male, 52  Pride is in a transformation. I think the mainstream has now started to welcome LGBT people as normal. I like this change. It will be better. For example, I cannot hold hands with my partner in my own country, and I do not put pressure on anyone for not being able to do that. I am not saying you have to accept me like that. I just want them to respect me. Thanks to Pride, this perception is changing. If Amsterdam Pride were not so influential, we would not be able to act so freely here regardless of our vested rights. So, there should not necessarily be protests. Pride is influential enough as it is. Isabel, Trans woman, 54  It is as it should be. It is inevitable that this organisation that originated from a kind of protest and a search for rights has changed and turned into entertainment in Amsterdam. This is because there is a different need now. There is a desire to be more visible and to be accepted in all forms. There is a desire to show not just homosexuality but also femininity, masculinity, or whatever category it falls under. If it was not for so much entertainment and partying, if it was not for so much commercial, it would never be that big, and there would never be visibility. Mark, Gay male, 29   Another point emphasised by the participants in the in-depth interviews is the increase in the prices of accommodation and food and drink in Amsterdam during the festival. The participants hold the view that Amsterdam Pride has evolved into what serves a capitalist purpose (Kates, 2003  ). Below are some outstanding remarks:It is turning into a tourism event because there are people coming here for this event. So, many sectors benefit from this festival: transportation, hotels, restaurants, and ships. I think it doubles with the Canal Parade boats. As LGBT, we do not like this situation; we are moving away from the original grassroots. When I looked at hotels before the festival and during the festival, I saw that the price difference was 20%. Francesco, Gay male, 68  The first shows, or the first pride, were shows made by trans people after the Stonewall uprising. But no one knows this history. Even gays start to party and have fun without researching their history to live their gay identity. But being LGBT is not about partying. When someone asks you about that history, if you are gay or if you are a lesbian, you should be able to answer. There are also other things that bother me. I wonder, for example, what the banks and institutions that have boats in Canal Parade are really doing for LGBT individuals and what are they doing for their LGBT employees. That is why I am not happy with pride. It is a matter of ideology. This is because if you are a minority, Pride's prevailing opinion does not please you. All festivals in Germany, France, and the Netherlands take shape around the prevailing view. These events are for tourists, for heterosexuals, for everyone. Pride has now become a place where everyone can have fun. Not for me. It does not belong to me. I support Pride, so I attend, but I am not content. I realise it has lost its political meaning, so I would not say I am content. I see it has turned into a Western pastime. Inequality bothers me. I do not want to move forward with the prevailing view. If the prevailing view is trying to impose on me what femininity is, what masculinity is, what gayness is, I cannot be with that. A pride dominated by handsome white western gays bothers me. Yasmin, Lesbian cisgender, 26  … As I said, if we talk about change, I see that there are companies now and the LGBT grassroots are scarce. I think this is a bad change. Pride has to be made up of people who are proud to be themselves, not proud of boats with a price of seventy thousand Euro, passing through the canals. Laura, Lesbian woman, 42   Accordingly, Amsterdam Pride plays a critical role in facilitating the reversal and demolition of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals and the acceptance and perception of LGBTQ+ individuals as ‘normal’ by the heteronormative society. Even though Amsterdam Pride contributes to the voice and visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals, the positive impact of pride is limited in the geographical borders that have LGBTQ+ rights. Also, as Browne and Bakshi (2011 )  highlight, geography has a critical role in discussing LGBTQ+ pride since some regions, such as Russia, criminalize LGBTQ+ individuals (Suchland, 2018  ). However, pride events still raise the freedom and rights of LGBTQ+ individuals in front of international audiences through the tools of social media and mass media. Also, the pride creates a highly diverse environment since everyone who supports LGBTQ+ equality attends it. This environment has a critical role in terms of providing an opportunity to give the message of equality for everyone to wider audiences. The festival opposes the heteronormative oppression that LGBTQ+ individuals are subjected to in everyday life and offers LGBTQ+ individuals a place where they feel free to express themselves through fun in the pride rather than protests. Also, since the participants of this pride have been considered as a consumer group by companies that are the sponsors of many events in the festival, the commercial activities have a transformative role in terms of creating an environment that includes fun rather than protests in terms of providing voice and visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals. For this reason, the aforementioned interlink between LGBTQ+ pride and commercial pride reveals a sustainable role for gender equality. The findings of this study are in line with those of previous studies indicating that pride festivals have created transformative outcomes for LGBTQ+ communities (Hughes, 2006a, 2006b ; Johnston & Waitt, 2015  ; Kates, 2003  ; Kates & Belk, 2001  ). Some participants (Patricia, John, Lisa and Fiona) also pointed out other positive outcomes of the Amsterdam Pride which are different from the above-mentioned views and literature:The change of Pride events offers a wider range of activities that are not exclusively for gays. The Drag Queen Olympics, for example. The Dyke March, for example. Patricia, Bisexual woman, 18  I think it is a very important development that Pride weekend has turned into such an open festival. Even if people have different perceptions, they are now more aware, closer to their rights. John, Gay male, 32  I think this is our day of celebration. It has already a protest inside. But I want it to be in a celebratory mood. We have a right to have fun. Lisa, Lesbian woman, 28  I think it has become very commercialised with tourism, but I also think, in this way, the Pride movement is getting more inclusive. If there is a protest, everyone does not support it. If there is fun, there are lots of people coming here, and you see support. Amsterdam reflects this very well. It gives both message and fun. Fiona, Lesbian woman, 24   The findings demonstrate that Amsterdam Pride and Pride Week are considered no longer gay events. It has an inclusive atmosphere in which a wide range of costumes and bodily performances (e.g. Drag Olympics and Dyke March) can be exhibited, and various sexual orientations and gender identities can be exposed. The transformation of Amsterdam Pride into a public festival makes it more possible to raise a holistic awareness of LGBTQ+ rights. It is noteworthy that the participants do not view the festival only as a means of protest. However, they also enjoy it in a celebratory mood, emphasizing that it is a right to have fun as well as to protest. The fact that the political aspect of the festival is not predominantly paved the way for more LGBTQ+ and even non-LGBTQ+ people to attend the festival. The festival thus has the opportunity to reach a much wider part of society. Having considered these aspects of the Amsterdam Pride, the findings demonstrate that the festival contributes to the sustainability of gender equality since it creates a continuous awareness, adopting celebration day rather than protest day and an inclusionary event. In this regard, the theme of fun is an integral part of the festival and a new area of agency of the political movement. In a way, the fun-based pride festival is shaped by the gains achieved at the end of many years of struggle for identity and civil rights. A participant who considers this situation in a European context describes the transformation that the Pride has undergone as follows:Like anything else, it has to change. Of course, the way of change is important. This depends on the country, society, and culture in which the identity struggle is waged. A struggle was waged in Europe and some rights were gained as a result of this struggle. The Pride movement is changing. Those who fought on the streets yesterday are now legitimately enjoying it and having fun. After all, nothing happens without money and Amsterdam Pride is done with a serious budget. They have to cover these expenses somehow. There are sponsor companies and institutions. They sponsor but they also do self-advertisement. Even if it is sometimes annoying, there is apparently no other way for the moment. So, we put up with it. Daniel, Gay male, 36   Amsterdam Pride is a festival that includes the mood of entertainment rather than protests. Even though it seems fun-oriented, the pride never loses its political focus because the fun is also ‘political’. These findings correspond with those of earlier studies conducted by Browne (2007 , 2009 ) , as she is the first to define LGBTQ+ festivals as “party with politics.” Our study extends such studies by exploring in-depth the meaning of politics for the participants of Amsterdam Pride in the light of SDGs. Politics has protest-struggle, solidarity, demand for equal rights, showing different bodies and identities meanings drawing on the participants' accounts. In other words, they attend pride as to show solidarity, different bodies and identities, demand for rights and protest-struggle against the heteronormative order. However, they do this with fun in activities such as parties, drag queen shows and canal pride. Thus, a new form of pride occurs, which is called in our study as an agency in the transformation of pride history. The participants criticise from many points of view that Pride has turned to be a consumption practice. The first criticism is against those who attend the festival only for entertainment purposes without knowing the origins and history of the LGBTQ+ struggle. Although the literature embodies many criticisms of pride festivals, no such finding has been reported. The participants think that the festival has departed from its original meaning and been reduced to an entertainment event due to tourism. The primary reason why the festival is held has been forgotten (Getz, 2007  ). However, based on the perspective of responsible consumption, the festival benefits the local economy because it creates more job opportunities for local people and the social integration of the workers. The second criticism is against the companies sponsoring the festival. The participants consider that sponsors are attempting exploitation using rainbow colours, as noted in the earlier studies (Kates, 2003  ; Kates & Belk, 2001  ; Wolf, 2009  ). However, using rainbow colours makes LGBTQ+ individuals visible in public. For this reason, consuming products of the sponsoring companies contributes to consciousness regarding gender equality. The third criticism is that these events address only western, middle- and upper-class white gays through the normalisation strategies of neoliberal policies and cause LGBTQ+ individuals to shift away from the original grassroots and assimilate (Markwell & Waitt, 2009  ; Taylor, 2014  ). Even though there is such criticism, this situation contributes to the awareness of gender equality through creating inclusionary perspectives for LGBTQ+ individuals in society. Thus, its progress and the other issues related to discrimination within the same group will be the next agendas for gender equality studies. The myth of the pink economy, an extension of neoliberal policies, is pointed out by many participants describing gay tourists as affluent consumer groups:It is all about money. I think tourism is part of that. Pride is held in the first week of August when the weather is at its best in Amsterdam, hotels are at their most empty, and there are lots of Airbnb homes. I think the Netherlands is a very systematic country, so these are things that have been considered. Parties are held all the time. Cruise ships are coming in. People are coming in flocks. We came from Turkey, for example. I think the Netherlands is very innovative in that sense. There is, for example, Gaybnb that belongs to gays. There is serious gay tourism going on here. There is an attraction called Homomonument, a memorial to gays who died in the Second World War. In my opinion, this also attracts tourists. Apart from that, there is a gay tourist information office, which is one of the things that surprised me. They all have been considered. They turn a disadvantage into an advantage. For example, the “I amsterdam” letters are quite famous. Everyone is taking pictures there. I think if you do not come to gay pride within the community, it means you do not come to Amsterdam. And I think gays have money because gays have little expense. And because everywhere in the world, men earn more than women, and there are few areas they can spend (because they have no children). I think they have a high income because they can work long hours because they do not have a traditional family life. Philip, Gay non-binary, 40  They want to make money, and they have seen that they can do it with pink money. By pink money, I mean the commercial system established for tourism activities of gay people is an important niche market because they have no family responsibility to spend money such as children, so they spend for themselves. Stefan, Gay male, 40   The participants believe that the festival has moved away from the political focus of the movement and evolved from a social movement into an entertainment and consumption-oriented event, thereby serving the commercial purposes of the sponsors and the tourism industry. It goes without saying that the participants are far from being satisfied with the response of the Amsterdam Pride organisers to these criticisms. The findings of this research demonstrate the link between pride and gender equality (SDG 5) in three ways: The first is to consider the pride as a platform that should focus on visibility of the problems related to the LGBTQ+ community and activities for raising problems instead of organising a series of touristic events. The second is to understand pride as the series of events that can provide visibility of the living experiences of the LGBTQ+ community. This situation contributes to gender equality (SDG 5) by providing the visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals in the streets and other social fields such as restaurants and public areas. Thus, the mainstream has welcomed LGBTQ+ individuals as an equal part of society. The third is to focus on the adverse side of the pride since the main theme of the pride adopts the beauty and idealised appearance of white gay individuals. Even though such perspectives contribute to the visibility of sexual minorities, it creates inequalities within the LGBTQ+ community. In addition to the link between pride and gender equality, since the participants recognise the need to contribute to the region's welfare and the existing profit-based approach of companies, they think this situation makes the pride less effective in terms of gender equality. As a result, the present theme indicates that pride as an output of social movement contributes to the visibility of the LGBT community even though there are capitalist agendas, strengths and weaknesses of the pride.  4.2 The consuming subjects of the festival: gay bodies The way gay identities and bodies represented at the festival are worth noting when dealing with the transformation Amsterdam Pride has undergone as a global tourism activity and the impact it has had on the LGBTQ+ social movement. It seems that gay bodies are used and exploited as an element of attraction. The festival is likely to turn into an event for ‘white’, ‘young’, ‘able’, ‘athletic’ and ‘wealthy’ gay men as if it were organised only for this group. The aesthetic body representation at the festival is subject to several criticisms from a social inclusion perspective, and the (gay) body is objectified to create consuming subjects at the festival that serves an inherently political message. These views reflect the features of Amsterdam Pride that are very much linked to consumption patterns within an increasingly neoliberal context of the festival. The pink economy myth paradoxically portrays LGBTQ+ bodies as both ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ (Butler, 1990  ). Those individuals have been transformed into consuming subjects as a niche market. Being a subject is a criticism against the heteronormative perspective within the framework of collective recognition, while it also creates a homonormative perspective (Costa, 2008  ). As a matter of fact, the spotlighting of gay bodies at the pride causes homonormativity, resulting in the exclusion of non-cisgender individuals. For example, the uniform, muscular gay male bodies are used as an icon for advertising in most places during the festival to attract more visitors and make them spend more which limits the visibility of non-cisgender identities as well as other minority members within the community (e.g. black and minority ethnic LGBTQ+ groups). As some participants attending the Amsterdam Pride questioned their belonging to pride, a similar situation was also observed in different contexts and addressed in the studies by Waitt and Stapel (2011 )  and De Jong (2017)  on Sydney Mardi Gras Festival. Moreover, certain body representations (so called ‘aesthetic’ and privileged) are consciously foregrounded in the heteronormative system due to commercial concern. The aforementioned situation leads to some questioning and discussion about the participants' sense of belonging that deserves further exploration from the viewpoint of fulfilling SDGs of inclusivity in events (Ong et al., 2021 ). Feeling included in the Pride, albeit given diverse sexualities and representations in the LGBTQ+ community, can be a critical form of belonging. Pride as an event has an important role by offering a possibility for diverse sexualities and identities to band together to echo their ignored existence to achieve social inclusion and contribute to the development of sustainable communities. This is in line with Goal 5 (Gender Equality) and Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) to reduce inequality and promote social, economic and political inclusion of people regardless of their age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or another status (United Nations, 2021  ). As can be seen, despite the fact that there is no explicit emphasis on sexual orientation and gender identity, SDGs highlight the inclusive societies with the ultimate aim of ensuring “no one is left behind” (United Nations, 2014  , p. 9). We can argue that this agenda set the challenging goals in front of the whole nations to tackle the root causes of structural inequalities and discrimination without having the need to openly declare the socially and historically marginalised status of sexual and gender minorities, which itself is a significant void in the SDGs. Considering the nature and characteristics of the Pride festival, the aforementioned changes are not unique to Amsterdam Pride. Similar politics and changes such as internal power dynamics within the LGBTQ+ community have happened in the west as well as other places (such as the study by Hartal (2019 )  on gay tourism to Tel-Aviv), particularly in the last two decades (De Jong, 2017 ; Kenttamaa Squires, 2019 ). This situation is very much connected to larger shifts of complex processes of commodification (De Jong, 2017 ), homonormativity (Brown, 2012  ), and rising waves of neoliberal discourses based on consumption in the globalised world (Duggan, 2002  ; Puar, 2002a, 2002b ). Amsterdam Pride can be a vivid example of an almost global process in this context. Drawing on the participants' accounts, Amsterdam Pride is embodied as an activity usually specific to western, white gay men with fit bodies. These criticisms caused the organisers to change the name of the festival. The festival, formerly called Amsterdam Gay Pride, was renamed as Amsterdam Pride in 2017. Along with the change of the name, changes were also made to the visuals of the 2017 festival, which were expected to be more inclusive. As reported by the participants, Amsterdam Pride has begun to include more inclusive bodily visuals rather than uniform body representations, thereby opening spaces for queer bodies and fighting against the heteronormative emphasis on normality. The participants who positively view this change expressed that the visuals reflect a more inclusive representation because Amsterdam Pride is attended by people of different ethnicities, bodily forms, sexual orientations, and gender identities. The participant views are as follows:I think this situation has been overcome with Milkshake Festival. The posters in 2017 included black women and white overweight women. I think it destroyed the boundaries. Of course, the representation of these forms of expression may also be related to the organisation that did this. What I want to say is that when I come to Amsterdam, I do not look at these posters, I look at the colours. But there is still the sexualisation of the body. Handsome, half-naked, white gays are prominent in posters. Yasmin, Lesbian cisgender woman, 26  There was a refugee male on the poster of the Milkshake Festival. Milkshake Festival is considered the beginning of Pride. This is interesting. They photoshopped the guy to make him look beautiful, but anyway, I liked it. I think tourism uses these mainstream aesthetic views, and this is why it reflects them at the festival. Of course, the mainstream still favours white western gays with a V-shaped body. Philip, Gay non-binary, 40   Even though Amsterdam Pride, which entered a new era in 2017 with the changes in the name and event visuals, aims at adopting a more inclusive and holistic approach towards LGBTQ+ individuals, it fails to cover all strands of sexual orientation and gender identity since the elements of the predominantly white, middle-and upper-class, idealised gay body image still stand out in the festival's content. This clearly shows that Amsterdam Pride, like other LGBTQ+ tourism practices, maintains the homonormative system by constructing a gay and lesbian identity (Markwell & Waitt, 2015  ; Puar, 2002a, 2002b ; Waitt & Gorman-Murray, 2008  ). The findings of this research raise the issue regarding two dimensions for gender equality. The first is equality between sexual identities (e.g., homosexuality and heterosexuality). The second is equality within sexual identities (e.g., gay, lesbian and transgender). The first phase of Amsterdam Pride focuses on sustainable gender equality between sexual identities since there is a lack of consciousness regarding gender roles. However, pride still is not successful in terms of overcoming the dominant heterosexist approach in society, and this situation creates an obstacle for both visibility and normalisation of sexual minorities in the social field. Then the second phase of the pride focuses on sustainable gender equality within sexual identities. Yet, participants perceive the pride as a gay dominant festival. For this reason, even if Amsterdam pride aims to promote gender equality by creating a holistic, sustainable and more inclusionary approach to all participants and the gender identities, it still fails to address the issues regarding gender identities. The main reason for this claim comes from the nature of Amsterdam Pride that focuses on LGBTQ+ tourism practices and locates in a liberal country with the participation of individuals around the world.   5 Discussion and conclusion The mainstream festival activities focus mostly on contributing to the social, economic and cultural development of a region that hosts the festival events (Chang & Hsieh, 2017  ). The success of such events is commonly evaluated based on their economic contribution to event stakeholders, the community and the region (Dimmock & Tiyce, 2001  ). In this regard, the main stakeholders are the residents in the community-based festivals. However, theme-based festivals such as Amsterdam Pride highlight a social impact through creating visibility and voice for LGBTQ+ individuals. The process of creating visible pride festivals started with the harmful stereotypes produced by the traditional media, which was recognized as allies in the struggles for civil rights (Rosa, Magalhães, Rodríguez-Castro, & Lopez, 2018  ). Following this stage, the first years of pride events focused on representing gay individuals and the binary of homo/hetero. Thus, this process demonstrates that pride has progressed in terms of visibility and voice of sexual identities. Even though the several findings of this research highlight similar concerns, such as recognising pride as a gay-based event, it also shows that pride provides the sustainability of gender equality (SDG 5) and responsible consumption (SDG 12) through cognitive impacts of sustainable tourism. The festivals have positive impacts that can cover increasing business and job opportunities, promoting regional culture and history (Song, Xing, & Chathoth, 2015 ). Also, theme-based festivals such as the Amsterdam Pride in our research provide sustainability of visibility and voice in gender equality. However, the findings of this research are limited to Amsterdam Pride. Since some countries either ban pride parades and criminalize the LGBTQ+ identity or blame LGBTQ+ individuals as having immoral behaviour, contextual differences create critical complexities for Pride events (Suchland, 2018  ). For this reason, Amsterdam Pride is a unique event within the context of this research. Pride events organised in Australia, USA and Israel, have been subject to several scholarly inquiries; however, we know relatively little about such events in Europe. This is one of the first crucial attempts to address the embodied approach to Amsterdam Pride, drawing on the 40 LGBTQ+ participants' accounts qualitatively in the light of sustainable development goals, particularly SDG 5 and SDG 12. Further research may concentrate on ‘LGBTQ+ friendly’ destinations and non-LGBTQ+ friendly contexts where Pride events are jeopardised. One cannot assume that the reflections of Amsterdam Pride that was studied in this study can be generalisable across all destinations given the massive disparities in Global North Prides- which are differently funded and politicised. The current study is particularly important to problematise the dominant heteronormative and cisnormative approach embedded in the SDGs discourse that has no specific remarks for LGBTQ+ communities. Hence, this paper is positioned under the pillar of social sustainability, promoting equal and fair representation, visibility and recognition of participants with diverse sexual and gender identities (Dangi & Jamal, 2016  ). By responding to the calls for bringing about social change that the UN has aimed to address with SDGs (but has not fulfilled adequately), we seek to question the inclusivity within the Pride specifically. We more broadly extend ‘taken for granted’ gender binary understanding of community events and festivals that prioritise heterosexual-cisgendered assumptions. This is also an important avenue in mainstream tourism and leisure studies as they have hitherto mostly neglected the political and queer nature of events (Hemingway, 1999  ; Mair & Reid, 2007  ; Ong et al., 2021 ). The transformation of Amsterdam Pride into a festival has given rise to criticisms that Pride has lost its political focus. So much so that Pride seems to have shifted away from its original meaning, which reflects the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights and freedom. The participants' remarks refer to LGBTQ+ tourists who attend the festival solely with the motivation of fun and the argument of apolitisation of LGBTQ+ subjects with tourism. However, some findings also demonstrate that transforming into a celebration day of Amsterdam Pride rather than a protest day can be more sustainable in terms of voice, recognition and visibility for LGBTQ+ individuals. Accordingly, Amsterdam Pride ensures the demands of gender equality for achieving sustainable development goals as it accommodates an inclusionary perspective that covers all sexual identities. The sponsor companies of the festival have an impact on gender equality processes by creating budgets for the events and highlighting the rainbow colours in their products. Thus, the sponsors contribute to the visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals and indirectly consciousness regarding equality for sexual minorities. Considering Amsterdam Pride in terms of responsible consumption perspective, the local people have more job opportunities. The festival provides social integration of workers that refers to incorporation into the social structure of host events. The aforementioned issues are considered a responsible consumption tool (Bob, Swart, Gounden, Gumede, & Nkambule, 2019 ). These companies' work for LGBTQ+ rights not only during the festival but also after the festival will undoubtedly be more meaningful for LGBTQ+ individuals' lives. Especially during the Canal Parade, boats are mostly sponsored by companies, which limits the self-expression of LGBTQ+ participants and perpetuates the heterosexual cultural norms. Although the sustainability of the festival depends on sponsors, it is equally important to ensure the continuation of the meaning of Pride Week. Therefore, there is a need to reduce the number of sponsors and allow LGBTQ+ participants to take part in sponsored boats even if they are named after sponsors. Thus, Amsterdam Pride should be able to bring more LGBTQ+ participants into the scene, as in the Michigan Womyn's Festival, which does not accept sponsors from big companies as a policy of the festival (Browne, 2009  ). This is so important to create a self-reliant, sustainable community to achieve locally responsible consumption goals. In addition, queer spaces that challenge heteronormativity with the pink economy myth are incorporated into the heterosexual cultural area when the festival ends, while LGBTQ+ locals/communities living in Amsterdam continue to face various challenges in their daily life practices. The increasing prices of tourist products and services such as accommodation, food and drink are among the major problems during the festival. The price increase has an adverse impact on participant experiences, especially for those whose profiles are different from the western, wealthy, gay tourist image pushed by the tourism industry. In this respect, tourism is a reason that has led to the transformation of a social movement into a consumption-oriented festival. In relation to the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights, the social impacts of Amsterdam Pride have also paved the way for transformations in LGBTQ+ lifestyles. The Pride Festival has facilitated the change of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals and the acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals by the heteronormative society, thereby helping LGBTQ+ individuals gain visibility and heightening public awareness of LGBTQ+. This makes it possible for the Pride message to reach wider audiences. The Pride offers spaces and places where LGBTQ+ individuals feel comfortable and safe to express themselves and defy the heteronormative pressure they are subjected to in everyday life. This is where the concept of existential authenticity of Amsterdam Pride comes in as it offers a valuable possibility for LGBTQ+ participants to experience their own state of being, so called ‘authentic self’ (Poria, 2007  , p. 251). We agree with Polchin (1997 , p. 386)  view that authenticity is likely to come into play when privacy comes out into the public domain, onto the street. However, while Amsterdam Pride seems to open up several spaces for LGBTQ+ participants where they can be themselves (at least for a while), they can enjoy and perform their “authentic” bodies and identities only for liminal time and space (see Van Gennep (2004 )  and Picard and Robinson (2006)  for further discussion on liminality). With the Amsterdam Pride Festival, Pride Week is no longer seen solely as a gay event, and queer bodies are now more visible. The most influential example is that the festival was renamed Amsterdam Pride in 2017, which was Amsterdam Gay Pride from 1996 until 2016. The transformation of Amsterdam Pride into an open festival raises LGBTQ+ individuals' awareness of their own rights because the festival also incorporates events related to the social, cultural, economic, political and health conditions of LGBTQ+ individuals. Amsterdam Pride offers LGBTQ+ individuals the opportunity to have fun and be visible in an open public space; therefore, the number of people who support the festival increases. The fun theme of Amsterdam Pride is an integral part of the festival and a new area of agency of the political movement. Amsterdam Pride cannot be regarded as a mere consumption practice. However, it creates a new conception of an agency whose fun is also political. This nature of Amsterdam Pride also creates socially responsible consumption logic. Based on the research of Tsai (2011 ) , a sense of civic connectedness through donations and volunteering contributes to the responsible consumption in the festivals of minority groups. As with other LGBTQ+ tourism practices, Amsterdam Pride is a tourist event that foregrounds gay tourists as a normalisation strategy created by the impact of neoliberal policies, which most participants strongly criticise. The pink economy myth paradoxically transforms gay tourists into consuming subjects as a niche market, while being a subject provides a collective recognition and at the same time creates a homonormative perspective. LGBTQ+ individuals are presented only with idealised bodies with certain criteria and characteristics. This is another ‘othering’ strategy that causes the heteronormative order to be embodied at the festival. Building on the queer and critical tourism scholarship, this study highlights the embodied approach to Amsterdam Pride. We can see that LGBTQ+ people see the event as a space for showing off their “normality”. The homonormativity is further strengthened by neoliberalism and ‘a depoliticised event anchored in consumption’ (Duggan, 2002  , p. 50). This leads to several disputes within the LGBTQ+ community itself on normalisation and sexual citizenship arguments. In this regard, the focus of Amsterdam Pride as a major tourism activity and attraction is positioned into ‘party’ and ‘entertainment’ rhetoric (Enguix, 2017  ; Johnston, 2005  ; Rushbook, 2005  ) and pinkwashing (Johnston, 2001  ; Kama & Ram, 2020  ) that complicates its politically embodied meanings (Hughes, 2006b  ). Moreover, as non-LGBTQ+ people attend more and more of the Amsterdam Pride, the subjects of Pride are overshadowed, which is another sign of assimilation of movement (Abrahamson, 2014  ; Taylor, 2014  ). The depoliticised nature of the event itself is highly ‘political’ that serves the purpose of neoliberal economy and consumer culture. Nevertheless, the changes in the festival clearly demonstrate that Amsterdam Pride has been trying to overcome these problems. Along with the change of the name, the visuals of the 2017 festival were also changed with an intention to make them more inclusive. Thus, Amsterdam Pride has incorporated more inclusive bodily visuals rather than uniform body representations, thereby opening more spaces for queer bodies and fighting against the heteronormative emphasis on normality. This development better reflects the spirit and symbol of the movement, i.e., rainbow, because Amsterdam Pride is also attended by tourists of different ethnicities, bodily forms, sexual orientations, and gender identities. If Amsterdam, known as a gay-friendly destination, reflects its inclusive approach throughout all festival events to a greater extent, it will stimulate authentic feelings and sensations among participants. Thus, Amsterdam can also become a destination of choice not only for LGBTQ+ individuals but also for people from all walks of life who value equality and diversity.
