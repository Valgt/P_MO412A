                  Despite the wealth of research on smart cities, there is a lack of studies examining interlinkages between smart cities and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In other words, there is limited research on how implementing smart city solutions can lead to co-benefits and/or trade-offs for achieving SDGs. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap. Results show that responsible development/implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward SDGs. The literature is mainly focused on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). More work on other SDGs is needed. There is a bias toward reporting the benefits of smart cities. These include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. These benefits indicate that smart cities could catalyze the transition to sustainable development and address climate change challenges. However, this requires addressing trade-offs related to issues such as privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, rebound effects associated with efficiency improvements, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, digital divide and lack of skills, misuse of AI, and limited legal setup. This review elaborates on these trade-offs and offers solutions to minimize them. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs. It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.

In other words, there is limited research on how implementing smart city solutions can lead to co-benefits and/or trade-offs for achieving SDGs. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap. Results show that responsible development/implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward SDGs. The literature is mainly focused on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). More work on other SDGs is needed. There is a bias toward reporting the benefits of smart cities. These include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. These benefits indicate that smart cities could catalyze the transition to sustainable development and address climate change challenges. However, this requires addressing trade-offs related to issues such as privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, rebound effects associated with efficiency improvements, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, digital divide and lack of skills, misuse of AI, and limited legal setup. This review elaborates on these trade-offs and offers solutions to minimize them. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs. It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.

Global attention has been drawn to urban areas and cities for the successful achievement of the SDGs. In fact, long before the launch of SDGs, there have been efforts to promote urban sustainability since the late 1980's when the Brundtland report was published (Brundtland, 1987 ). Aligned with the report's agenda, urban sustainability efforts aim to prioritize the needs of both present and future generations by promoting urbanization patterns and implementing plans and policies that do not compromise the needs of future generations. The background to this is that the world is rapidly urbanizing, with over 55Â % of the world's population currently hosted in cities. By 2050, this share is projected to increase to approximately 68Â % to 70Â % (Kaneda, Greenbaum, & Kline, 2020 ). As such, cities have become very critical in addressing the socio-economic and environmental challenges facing the world today. The increasing global emphasis on urban transformation as a crucial element in achieving the SDGs has sparked extensive research. This literature demonstrates that cities are pivotal in driving the desired global changes. As noted in a report by the OECD (2022) , most cities across the world have various policies and frameworks aimed at guiding operations and activities in underlying sectors such as water, housing, land use, climate change, transport, economy, and others that are pertinent to the SDGs. Further, it is argued that cities are more nimble and innovative than central governments, making them more likely to take transformative actions toward sustainability (Masuda, Kawakubo, Okitasari, & Morita, 2022 ). According to Leavesley, Trundle, and Oke (2022) , the potential for local governments within a city to learn, share information, and transfer knowledge with their peers on ways to formulate customized policies targeting local challenges renders them the best candidates for achieving the SDGs. Cities can also develop strategies and mechanisms to finance various projects, particularly since these projects may not require as much capital as central government initiatives (Masuda et al., 2022 ). However, it is notable that the implementation of SDGs at the city scale is challenging as they are designed to be adopted at the national level. Several studies have highlighted the limitations of existing indicators and targets for operationalizing the SDGs (including SDG 11) in cities. Such studies have made efforts to align SDGs to the urban context and offer frameworks for measuring progress toward SDGs (particularly SDG 11) in cities (Berisha, Caprioli, & Cotella, 2022 ; Koch & Krellenberg, 2018 ). Therefore, at the city level, there is a need for extensive research, especially on the best planning models that could be adopted to facilitate the achievement of the goals and ensure alignment with earlier agendas like the Brundtland report (Brundtland, 1987 ). One such model that is gaining substantial attention is the Smart City, which is anchored on the application of diverse smart technologies in the planning, management, monitoring, and operation of city activities. It has evolved from earlier models such as digital city, ubiquitous city, and knowledge city, and has a wider scope compared to them. In fact, while smart city projects and developments were initially technology-centered, the role of non-technological aspects (i.e., people, institutions, social innovation, knowledge economy, etc.) is increasingly recognized. Accordingly, smart cities are expected to facilitate the integration of technological, social, economic, and institutional dimensions to enhance quality of life, address local and global challenges, and promote the transition to sustainable development (Sharifi, 2019 ). Sustainability and smartness are believed to be highly linked. For instance, a comprehensive analysis of city labels shows that âsustainable cityâ and âsmart cityâ are the most frequently co-occurring ones (Schraven, Joss, & de Jong, 2021 ). Smart cities may sometimes fail to contribute to the sustainability agenda, as an analysis of links between smart city policies and CO2  emissions indicates (Yigitcanlar & Kamruzzaman, 2018 ). However, other studies, such as Schraven et al. (2021) , show that smart cities can contribute to achieving SDGs. Irrespective of the nature of the relationship between smart cities and SDGs, Yigitcanlar et al. (2019)  emphasize that overlooking the link between sustainability and smartness in the urban development process can give rise to risks such as prioritization of short-term gains, marginalization, elitism, utilitarianism, commercial considerations prevailing over environmental concerns, and ultimately materialism. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the potential of the smart city concept and its contributions to SDGs has gained increasing recognition in the past few years (Deloitte, 2020 ). Some efforts have been made to investigate links between smart cities and SDGs. Visvizi and del Hoyo (2021a, 2021b)  believe the Smart City concept's technological aspects can enable players to secure real-time data and feedback on different SDG indicators. This allows them to concentrate on the targeted implementation of different programs. Further, the Smart City approach allows for enhanced governance via tech-enabled tools, which is a relevant component, especially in providing a voice to urban dwellers who are important constituents in attaining the SDGs. The Smart City concept is also premised on optimal resource consumption, where novel approaches such as alternative mobility are promoted to replace fossil fuel-dependent urban activities. Further, with sensors and smart devices, smart cities can champion the prudent consumption of water and energy (through smart metering) (Talari et al., 2017 ). Despite the above-mentioned efforts, research on links between smart cities and SDGs is fragmented and mainly focused on the contributions of smart cities to achieving SDGs. In particular, there has been a special focus on contributions to SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (United Nations, 2021 ). A key gap is regarding smart cities' negative impacts in pursuing SDGs. For instance, it is not examined how the financial burden of implementing the smart city concept would compromise the achievement of SDGs 1, 2, 5, 12, and others. Investigating such trade-offs is essential as cities have often fallen short in promoting inclusivity, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue (UN-Habitat, 2022 ). Smart city solutions and technologies have also led to trade-offs related to the security and privacy of urban dwellers (Ismagilova, Hughes, Rana, & Dwivedi, 2020 ; van Zoonen, 2016 ). Further, there have been trade-offs regarding SDG12, with underwhelming performance regarding responsible consumption and production seen to increase. Existing literature is deficient in critically analyzing the underlying theoretical principles that connect these two concepts. Specifically, the prevailing technocratic ideology, which assumes that the advancement of smart city technologies will necessarily result in sustainability, has not been rigorously interrogated. Also, as mentioned earlier, articles focused on measuring progress toward SDGs, including SDG 11, have not adequately focused on the interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs (Berisha et al., 2022 ; Koch & Krellenberg, 2018 ). This study embarks on a more discerning examination of the connection between smart cities and SDGs, utilizing critical urban theory perspectives that challenge the techno-centric paradigms of urban futures. It contends that there must be a more deliberate focus on issues such as power dynamics, political considerations, and social justice within smart city initiatives to ensure that they align with the broader social objectives encapsulated in the SDGs, rather than disproportionately favoring technocratic elites (Alizadeh & Sharifi, 2023a, 2023b ). Through this examination, this review aims to outline theoretical tensions, potential conflicts, and paradoxes within the smart city-SDG relationship that have hitherto been insufficiently explored. Additionally, the review contributes to the theoretical discourse on how smart urbanism may be effectively leveraged for sustainable development (Brundtland, 1987 ). Some efforts have focused on SDGs and the design of smart solutions for urban and regional development. Such efforts have attempted to establish objectives, themes, and a framework to connect these concepts (Fredericks et al., 2020 ; Fredericks et al., 2022 ). However, there is still a lack of review studies that comprehensively explore interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs. Blasi, Ganzaroli, and De Noni (2022)  conducted a literature review to examine the convergence between research on smart cities and SDGs. Through word analysis, they found that these two fields are not yet well-converged. There has been more attention to technological and efficiency-related issues, but environmental and social issues are not well addressed (Blasi et al., 2022 ). They also highlighted the dominance of SDG11 and limited attention to other SDGs. Overall, this study argues that the contributions of smart cities to SDGs are not yet clear. Despite their contributions, Blasi et al. (2022)  do not look into the co-benefits and trade-offs related to each SDG. Further, their work is just based on word analysis of keywords and titles of only 21 articles. Finally, limited efforts focusing on the connection between smart technologies and environmental sustainability have suffered from technologically-deterministic approaches. Burgess (2023)  criticizes such approaches and calls for a more nuanced understanding of everyday data cultures. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap and further elaborate on the interlinkages between smart city solutions and technologies and the SDGs. Here, interlinkages mean co-benefits and trade-offs. The concept of co-benefits refers to the additional positive outcomes related to sustainable development goals that can result from implementing smart city initiatives and policies. In contrast, trade-offs arise when implementing smart city measures negatively impacts the attainment of SDGs. In other words, certain solutions devised to make cities smarter may have unintended consequences for the ongoing endeavors to achieve SDGs. This review is guided by two questions: 1- How can smart city solutions and technologies contribute to the achievement of SDGs? 2- What are the potential negative impacts of smart solutions and technologies on SDGs that need to be addressed? In addition, the review also discusses key challenges that need to be addressed and policy and regulatory frameworks that should be developed to ensure smart cities can contribute to the achievement of SDGs.  2 Materials and methods A systematic literature review was conducted for the purpose of this study. The review is guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach for literature search and selection (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & The, 2009 ). The flowchart showing different steps related to this approach is shown in Fig. 1  . SCOPUS was selected among different academic databases, given its broad coverage of quality peer-reviewed literature related to the topic. Seventeen broad-based search strings related to different SDGs were developed to retrieve articles from SCOPUS (see Supplementary Appendix I ). These strings were informed by the method used by McCollum et al. (2018) , who studied âenergy-related interactions between SDGsâ. The literature search was conducted at the end of 2022 and returned 322 articles. After excluding overlaps, 79 articles remained in the database. The lead author checked these and excluded ten papers which did not include information on the links between smart cities and SDGs. Next, the reference sections of the 69 remaining papers were checked, and four other relevant papers were added to the final database that included 73 documents. In addition to these documents, this review relies on other literature related to smart cities and SDGs to interpret the study findings. These include references suggested by the reviewers.

In addition to these documents, this review relies on other literature related to smart cities and SDGs to interpret the study findings. These include references suggested by the reviewers. A deductive approach was followed for content analysis. More specifically, a structured Excel spreadsheet was developed that specifies what information needs to be extracted. These include information on various issues such as the sectoral and geographic focus of the study, methodological approaches, direct and indirect linkages to SDGs, major smart city dimensions related to the study (these were determined based on an earlier research by Sharifi (2019) ), co-benefits and trade-offs for the SDGs, the consequences of the pandemic, and governance issues. The content analysis was conducted in three stages. The first three authors participated in the first stage. The lead author reviewed all papers. Simultaneously, the selected papers were divided among the second and third authors for separate content analysis. In the second stage, the lead author compared his extraction sheet with those completed by co-authors to identify areas of disagreement. The last author was invited to review the papers where disagreements were found. Finally, considering the opinions of all authors, in the third stage, the authors elaborated on the areas of disagreement and made a final decision. While there could still be some issues due to subjective judgments, this approach has helped improve the data extraction accuracy. In addition to the systematic review, a term co-occurrence analysis using the VOSviewer software was conducted to gain an overall understanding of the reviewed papers. The software has been used to map the knowledge structure of different fields (Sharifi, 2021 ). The outputs of the software are networks of nodes and links, where node size is proportional to the frequency of the occurrence of the terms, and link width is proportional to the strength of their connection. The term map is useful for understanding dominant topics; therefore, it was used to complement our systematic review.  3 Results and discussions 3.1 Literature overview Of the 73 reviewed papers, 45 are journal articles, 14 are conference papers, and 14 are book chapters. While SDGs were launched in 2015, the first papers in our database were published in 2017 (No.4). Also, five papers were published in the following year. The number of annual publications on this topic has increased ever since. Specifically, 10, 20, 23, and 11 papers were published in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. In terms of methodological approaches, most studies (No.53) are qualitative based on methods such as descriptive analysis, literature review, grounded theory, interviews, and consensus-based expert elicitation. The rest have adopted mixed-methods and quantitative approaches such as modeling and simulation, spatial analysis, multi-criteria analysis, scenario making, energy consumption monitoring, and regression analysis. Regarding geographic focus, most studies have a generic approach (No. 33). Interestingly, 22 papers are focused on cities in developing countries. The rest (No.18) deal with issues related to cities in developed countries. To understand the thematic focus, three different approaches were adopted, namely, term co-occurrence analysis, exploring sectoral linkages, and exploring linkages to smart city dimensions. Results of the term co-occurrence analysis (Fig. 2  ) show that existing literature is mainly focused on issues related to Good Health and Well-being (SDG3), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), and Climate Action (SDG 13). According to Fig. 2 , issues related to cities and urban planning (e.g., terms such as urban policy, urban growth, urban development, urbanization, sustainable city, and planning) are dominant. Other dominant areas, according to the term co-occurrence analysis, are energy (e.g., energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy utilization), technologies and infrastructure (e.g., IoT, ICT, big data, data mining, machine learning), and environmental monitoring and planning (e.g., climate change, environmental monitoring, waste management, environmental protection, and air quality). These results indicate that relatively more attention has been paid to environmental and technological aspects of the interaction between smart cities and SDGs. To further explore thematic focus, a content analysis of the reviewed papers was done to understand how they address different sectors, SDGs, and smart city dimensions (Sharifi, 2020 ). Results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4   . Fig. 3  is based on the primary focus of the reviewed papers. In other words, it is based on the primary sector, SDG, and smart city dimensions addressed by each paper. This figure shows that existing research is primarily focused on urban management, ICT, transportation, and energy. Issues related to these sectors have mainly been discussed in the context of SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). In turn, these are mainly linked to three dominant smart city dimensions, namely, environment, governance, and mobility. Obviously, considering the primary focus, less attention has been paid to linkages between smart city solutions and technologies and socio-economic issues. As some measures could have implications and linkages to multiple SDGs, sectors, and dimensions, the overall focus of the reviewed papers was also explored (i.e., primary and non-primary). This approach allows considering indirect linkages between sectors, SDGs, and dimensions. Results, presented in Fig. 4 , indicate that dominant sectors, SDGs, and smart city dimensions are almost the same. More specifically, management, ICT, and energy are dominant sectors that are linked to dominant SDGs such as SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). In turn, these are linked to various dimensions; particularly, environment, living, and governance that are dominant. However, an interesting finding is that more balanced attention to different SDGs and smart city dimensions can be observed when both primary and non-primary linkages are considered. This shows that smart city measures can indirectly contribute to different SDGs. The only SDGs that have received relatively less attention are SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), SDG 1 (No Poverty), and SDG 4 (Quality Education). Interlinkages between smart city solutions and different SDGs are further discussed in the following section.  3.2 Interlinkages between smart city solutions and different SDGs As was discussed in the previous section, SDGs 11, 7, 8, 12, 3, 13, 10, and 6 have received more attention in the literature, indicating their higher relevance to smart cities. Therefore, considering the journal's word limit, these SDGs are discussed in detail. The other SDGs will be briefly discussed in the main text, and interested readers are referred to Supplementary Appendix II for more details. 3.2.1 SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing Good health and well-being is an important facet of the global development agenda. It is particularly a pertinent issue in urban settings where there are many triggers with capacities to compromise the health agenda. For instance, factors like a sedentary lifestyle, poor water quality, pollution, overcrowding, and food insecurity can contribute to increased unhealthy outcomes (Wu et al., 2020 ). As a result, it would be expected that substantial research would be conducted showcasing how the implementation of the smart city concept would help accelerate SDG 3. However, from our analysis, only a handful of papers directly relate the smart city concept to good health and well-being. The implementation of smart cities could provide multiple benefits, such as reduced emissions due to emphasis on electric vehicles and the adoption of renewable energy (Liu, Yang, & Osmani, 2021 ), enhanced air and water quality through the utilization of machine learning for health assessment (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra, & Zamora-Polo, 2020a, 2020b ), improved indoor air quality using building information modeling systems (Liu et al., 2021 ), reduced congestion and increased share of active transportation via new mobility systems such as bike sharing (Moreno, Allam, Chabaud, Gall, & Pratlong, 2021 ), enhanced exchange of healthcare data between various entities (Mora, Mendoza-Tello, Varela-Guzman, & Szymanski, 2021 ), and improved access to healthcare services to vulnerable groups (Liaqat, Sajjad, Waseem, & Alhelou, 2021 ). Some examples are elaborated on in the remainder of this section. The installation of diverse sensor-enabled lighting technologies in smart cities is argued by Tavares, Ingi, AraÃºjo, Pinho, and Bhusal (2021)  to enhance good health and well-being, especially concerning the psychological effects associated with visual and non-visual perception, including that of safety. Availability of outdoor lighting is also linked to reduced road injuries and other health challenges directly associated with little or no lighting. However, Foth and Caldwell (2018)  warn about the negative impacts of artificial lighting on animals' lives. For example, it can cause birds to migrate too early or too late, missing the ideal climate conditions for nesting. This is an issue that should be considered in the design of smart lighting systems. Smart cities are also hailed for promoting clean energy production, which has positive impacts on the health and well-being of urban residents (De Las Heras et al., 2020a, 2020b ). Another benefit, as argued by Varghese, Pathak, and Varde (2021) , is help in the reduction of food waste in cities, especially using mobile applications supported by smart infrastructures. With this application, it was particularly possible to connect suppliers with consumers during the height of COVID-19, thus, reducing wastage as well as allowing urban residents to have a regular supply which is critical for their health. Optimizing waste collection and management using modeling and monitoring systems is another contribution of smart solutions that has implications for urban health (Hannan et al., 2020 ). Building Information Modeling can promote health and well-being in multiple ways. Through real-time monitoring, it allows timely diagnosis of safety threats in buildings and alerts residents and developers of actions that need to be taken. Similarly, building information modeling enables better control of indoor air quality and improved regulation of building energy use, thereby contributing to achieving âhealthy buildingsâ (Liu et al., 2021 ; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2022 ). Ensuring access to healthcare services for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and physically challenged is essential for achieving SDG 3. In this regard, smart cities can offer novel solutions for providing healthcare through sensor-enabled apps for vital sign monitoring, and remote monitoring, surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment services (Hussain, Wenbi, da Silva, Nadher, & Mudhish, 2015 ; Ismagilova, Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019 ; Liaqat et al., 2021 ). Exchanging healthcare data between various entities and centers is necessary for the timely and efficient provision of remote healthcare services. Such data exchange may, however, result in privacy and confidentiality breaches. Blockchain can help address such issues. Further, through optimizing supply chain management, blockchain can help address issues related to the efficacy loss of medical products such as vaccines (Mora et al., 2021 ). Smart solutions have also proven effective under crisis conditions. For instance, digital tools such as tracing apps have been widely used to control the spread of COVID-19 (Hassankhani, Alidadi, Sharifi, & Azhdari, 2021 ; Sharifi, Khavarian-Garmsir, & Kummitha, 2021 ). Blockchain-based platforms have been used to track patients securely and keep them anonymous (Mora et al., 2021 ). Despite these merits, smart technologies have also been criticized for promoting technological solutionism and undermining the rule of law (Mann, Mitchell, & Foth, 2022 ). Mann et al. (2022)  specifically target global technology corporations, such as Google and Apple, for compromising the sovereignty and autonomy of states in dealing with the pandemic.  3.2.2 SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation Although this goal is mentioned in several publications, direct contributions such as real-time monitoring of water and wastewater resources, early warning systems, and predictive models for water management are rarely explored (Ismagilova et al., 2019 ). However, some co-benefits associated with water management are derived from implementing smart cities and technologies such as AI and Blockchain. Among other things, these could contribute to more efficient water provision and wastewater management, enhance environmental awareness, ensure water security and improve access to safe drinking water, and enable cities to deal with the nexus between water, energy, and food (Blasi et al., 2022 ; Mora et al., 2021 ; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2022 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). For instance, Parmentola, Petrillo, Tutore, and De Felice (2022)  show that adopting Blockchain technology in smart cities could help support peer-to-peer water rights trading. This could enable the saving of water resources, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability (Parmentola et al., 2022 ). The same technology could assist in awarding waste and water management contracts, thereby reducing costs and bureaucracies. Blockchain and other AI-based technologies could also facilitate autonomous water distribution and management systems that can optimize water management in water-stressed areas and sectors. These can contribute to monitoring distribution to ensure equitable access to water resources, minimize loss, and control quality (Mora et al., 2021 ). Further, there are projects such as Thewaterproject.org  and Charitywater.org ,1  1 Both websites were accessed on September 9, 2022.   where blockchain technology has been used to raise funding (through donations made by cryptocurrency) to ensure access to clean drinking water in sub-Saharan Africa. The technology enables tracking and monitoring donations, thereby contributing to transparency. Also, by eliminating the need for intermediaries, the technology enables faster and less-costly money transfers (Mora et al., 2021 ). Kutty, Abdella, Kucukvar, Onat, and Bulu (2020)  argue that smart city platforms can monitor and control water source contamination. Further, they can facilitate water recycling, which is essential for achieving SDG 6. Blasi et al. (2022)  noted that within the smart city platform, it is possible to detect and locate leakages and other challenges within the water distribution systems and take quick action to curtail related negative impacts quickly and effectively. The smart devices deployed within smart cities further increase capacities and capabilities to estimate and monitor water usage, water quality, demand, and other factors in real time, allowing for comprehensive actions on issues like shortages, contaminations, security, and others. Despite these potentials, Kutty et al. (2020)  highlight that the competition by corporations in their pursuit of maximum profits sometimes compromises the provision of social services. As such, there are fears that the availability and universal accessibility to clean and safe drinking water may not be emphasized enough, especially for informal settlements. This form of competition has had serious implications, especially during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Failing to emphasize the achievement of SDG 6 in smart cities would have ripple effects on the achievements of other directly related SDGs, such as SDG 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, and 13.  3.2.3 SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy The SDGs, along with other global accords and documents such as the Paris Agreement launched in 2015, strengthen and increase the efforts to seek alternative energy generation models. Therefore, it is no surprise that promoting renewable energies is at the heart of smart city initiatives (Zaheer, 2020 ). This explains why many studies have directly focused on the energy sector. The literature has mentioned various benefits of smart city solutions and technologies, including reduction of peak loads, demand and consumption optimization, load monitoring and forecasting to minimize disruptions, decentralized energy generation, integration of renewable energy systems, smart energy storage, enhanced awareness of and control over energy consumption, improved efficiency of indoor and outdoor lighting systems, and identification and reduction of cases of illegal wiretapping (Blasi et al., 2022 ; Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2018 ; Liaqat et al., 2021 ; Ryan et al., 2020 ; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2022 ). A key benefit is reductions in energy consumption. As a case in point, SmartCity Malaga project in Spain reduced electricity consumption by 25Â % through efficiency improvements and the integration of demand monitoring and management systems (De Las Heras et al., 2020a, 2020b ). However, it is essential to highlight that the optimization approach and its reported benefits have encountered criticism from specific scholars. For instance, Loh, Foth, Caldwell, Garcia-Hansen, and Thomson (2020)  underscore that the foundation of the optimization perspective rests upon assumptions that might not inherently correlate with ecological principles. The optimization levels presented by market forces may inadequately apprehend the complexities of rebound effects and fail to encompass the entirety of vital aspects of life and sustainability (Giampietro & Mayumi, 2018 ; Loh et al., 2020 ). The benefits of smart solutions have also been examined in other contexts. For instance, a simulation study for Mashhad, Iran, demonstrates that Artificial Neural Network soft computing can be utilized to predict electrical energy consumption with high accuracy. Such models allow smart monitoring and management of energy. Further, when coupled with PV systems, they can facilitate the optimization of energy systems and ensure urban energy resilience (Ghadami et al., 2021 ). In another simulation study for Amaravati, India, Bardhan, Debnath, Gama, and Vijay (2020)  demonstrate how Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy-sharing systems can be developed to promote decentralized energy generation (rooftop PV) and combat energy shortages that could make it difficult to deal with urban heat in the Global South. This will also provide opportunities to improve energy accessibility and affordability, with indirect benefits for SDG 10 on inequalities and SDG 3 on health. Blockchain technology can be used to optimize such sharing systems by facilitating peer-to-peer energy trading between small producers and consumers. This will increase energy resilience by helping reduce transmission losses (Parmentola et al., 2022 ). Some blockchain-based tokens, such as SolarCoin and NRGcoin, have been developed that can be traded as cryptocurrencies by local energy producers. Such community-based trading of renewable energy further contributes to diversifying the energy supply and minimizing the risk of supply disruption (Mora et al., 2021 ). They are also conducive to further promotion of renewable energy through implementing alternative models such as microgrids (Mora et al., 2021 ; Parmentola et al., 2022 ). Overall, these could provide new means to promote decentralized and community-based renewable energy generation and enhance energy security and resilience (Sharifi & Yamagata, 2016 ). Integrating renewable energy into the conventional grid is another key benefit of smart cities. Blasi et al. (2022)  note that such integration increases the capacity of cities to pursue emission reduction agendas. This is made possible by the availability of different systems within the smart city frameworks that allow small-scale energy production on rooftops. Further, machine learning tools and big data analytics can facilitate such integration through real-time load prediction and demand-response models (De Las Heras et al., 2020a, 2020b ). The smart aspects further allow for the adoption of Appliance Level Energy Characterization (ALEC), as mentioned by Liaqat et al. (2021) , which ultimately allows for achieving SDGs and decarbonization targets. The incorporation of renewable energies in cities can also reduce the costs of electricity production. This is due to the ubiquitous nature of products such as solar panels and storage tools like batteries, which were relatively expensive, but have become affordable after the emergence and incorporation of smart technologies in cities (Allam, 2020 ; Dhunny, Allam, Lobine, & Lollchund, 2019 ; Dhunny, Doorga, Allam, Lollchund, & Boojhawon, 2019 ; Evans, 2020 ; IRENA, 2019 ). Another major contribution of smart solutions is that the smart grid facilitates real-time communication of energy consumption to different stakeholders, enabling better decisions and contributing to efficiency enhancement (Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2018 ). Smart solutions such as AI techniques could be used to strengthen the integration of renewable energy in smart grids by facilitating the partial matching of demand to times when more renewable energy could be generated (e.g., sunny hours) (Ryan et al., 2020 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). When coupled with smart metering, smart grids could also provide other benefits. For instance, Liaqat et al. (2021)  explain how smart meters and appliance-level energy characterization can help address SDG 7 through better awareness of and control over energy consumption and appliance energy intensity. Moreover, the integration of smart technologies has the potential to enhance the role of prosumers as important contributors to a more sustainable and accessible energy transition. In contrast to traditional consumers, prosumers actively participate in not only consuming but also generating, storing, and trading energy. This active involvement supports efforts toward sustainability within the energy sector and makes a significant contribution toward achieving SDGs (Hua et al., 2022 ). Prosumers play a pivotal role in driving the adoption of renewable energy sources and are becoming increasingly influential figures in facilitating society's transition toward cleaner energy sources (Hua et al., 2022 ). Although smart cities offer many benefits for SDG 7, proper governance measures are needed to avoid potential trade-offs. In the absence of such measures, the broad adoption of renewable sources in smart cities could widen inequality gaps, especially concerning people with no capacity to shift to renewable energy (Liaqat et al., 2021 ). Further, as mentioned earlier, efficiency improvements could result in rebound effects that could minimize the ecological contributions of smart cities.  3.2.4 SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the economic system in its entirety, with severe impacts on economic growth and job and venture creation. It has caused disruptions to production and supply chains and raised insecurities and vulnerabilities. As a result, billions of lives have been affected, the global economy has been endangered, and achieving the targets of SDG 8 remains uncertain. This is compounded by other crises and geopolitical tensions that have direct impacts on per capita economic growth, levels of economic productivity, gender equality (SDG 5) in terms of productive employment, and efficiency in consumption and production (SDG 12). To achieve the targets of SDG 8, many developed countries are increasingly experimenting with new economic models aligned with the Circular Economy (CE) and Green Economy (GE) (Dong, Liu, & Bian, 2021 ). These models facilitate key policy objectives and smart practices for ensuring economic growth while reducing environmental impacts. Regarding resource management, CE requires the use of advanced technologies to enhance institutional capacities and reaches, to enable policy reforms based on evidence-based decisions and cross-cutting analysis, to upgrade legacy infrastructure, and to facilitate financial mechanisms. CE has a key role in achieving SDGs in smart cities. Integrating digital and green economies can create significant opportunities to develop a knowledge economy and facilitate productivity growth in the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors (Savchenko & Borodina, 2020 ). Such integration is beneficial as it improves creativity and productivity, reduces risks, and helps overcome spatial accessibility challenges, allowing for more efficient resource management and better provision of services to different societal groups (Savchenko & Borodina, 2020 ; Truby, 2020 ). This could also provide opportunities for decoupling economic growth and negative environmental impacts (Ismagilova et al., 2019 ). However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the greedy desire of large corporations for wealth and control and the gap between the ruling class, the privileged class, the middle class, and the poor class in many democratic societies, undermining decent work and the fair distribution of wealth and cost, and continued economic growth. While the bottlenecks and roadblocks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic need urgently to be addressed and overcome, the digitalization of the economy in its entirety could help deal with this global crisis. In other words, it has been claimed that the digital economy has proven instrumental in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic (Sharifi, Khavarian-Garmsir, & Kummitha, 2021 ). Consequently, this crisis has accelerated the rise of e-commerce and the whole process of digital transformation across almost all economic sectors. Hence, changes to consumer behavior are likely to stay as the economic processes, governmental frameworks, and data infrastructure of digital platforms have largely penetrated all economic sectors of urban society. These transformations are reorganizing cultural practices and socio-technical imaginaries around digital platforms (Poell, Nieborg, & van Dijck, 2019 ). Indeed, platformization is rapidly becoming central in framing new discourses and materialities of urban futures (Barns, 2019 ). Smart solutions can facilitate enhanced, simplified, and safer access to banking and finance for small- and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries (Truby, 2020 ). For instance, the potential of digital technologies to transform businesses in Africa has already been recognized (Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2018 ). Among different solutions, by accepting payment by cryptocurrencies and enabling micro credits, blockchain-based platforms offer small businesses and entrepreneurs opportunities to expand their access to financial services, mainly available to large businesses in conventional banking and financial markets. This can promote further entrepreneurial and innovative activities. In addition, Blockchain-based platforms such as Slavefreetrade2  2 https://www.slavefreetrade.org/ , accessed on August 20, 2022.   and Everglader3  3 https://everledger.io/ , accessed on August 20, 2022.   allow consumers to track products to understand if they are original and have been sourced ethically. They can also facilitate anonymous reporting of working conditions to minimize modern-day slavery, thereby contributing to more decent and dignified working conditions in the long run (Mora et al., 2021 ). Proper governance and regulatory mechanisms are needed to ensure just and effective implementation of such platforms. For instance, the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) establishes standardized market rules for crypto-assets within the European Union. This regulatory framework addresses crypto-assets that currently lack regulation under existing financial services legislation.4  4 https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica , accessed on September 19, 2023.   By regulating public offerings of crypto-assets and promoting consumer awareness about associated risks, MiCA aims to uphold market integrity and enhance financial stability. Such regulatory frameworks should also be implemented in other contexts. Another important contribution is that the operational efficiency facilitated by smart technologies offers opportunities to save costs and allocate more budget to activities that can facilitate local economic growth. For instance, Hannan et al. (2020)  demonstrated that solid waste collection optimization using modeling and monitoring systems could yield significant cost savings. However, if not implemented with sustainable development in mind, smart solutions could deepen the inequality gaps in society. Therefore, capacity development programs are needed to ensure all social groups have the necessary skills to utilize smart solutions to improve their quality of life and contribute to economic productivity (Truby, 2020 ).  3.2.5 SDG 10: Reduced inequalities Reducing inequality is one of the key aspects of social sustainability. The UN highlights the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the progress toward SDG 10 (UN, 2022 ). Emerging technologies can promote social, economic, and political inclusion by enabling participatory mechanisms and democratic processes, adopting more responsive social policies that promote equality, improving the regulation of global institutions, and ensuring equal job and social opportunities (Ismagilova et al., 2019 ; Masik, Sagan, & Scott, 2021 ). Concerning the latter, Batty et al. (2012)  highlight the need for emerging technologies to improve accessibility to job and social opportunities. In addition, ICT contributes to evaluating and monitoring the progress of SDG 10 like other SDGs. For instance, AI can identify inequality in the distribution of resources and access to services and help monitor changes over time (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). Blockchain is a specific technology that can reduce inequalities. It can improve the transparency of donation and fundraising programs, allowing donors to monitor how their donations are used and how impactful they are. This will increase people's trust in social organizations and is likely to result in more donations (Mora et al., 2021 ). Through reducing transaction costs, using cryptocurrencies, blockchain platforms such as Bitpesa in Kenya have facilitated more remittances to developing countries. Such remittances are essential for strengthening the local economy and empowering vulnerable social groups (Mora et al., 2021 ). Further, in some contexts, such as Estonia, blockchain-based digital IDs have been given to migrants and refugees to track their access to financial resources, healthcare services, and employment opportunities, thereby reducing inequalities (Mora et al., 2021 ). Despite multiple potential benefits, some studies have challenged the claim that smart cities can provide quality services to all citizens. Luusua, Ylipulli, Foth, and Aurigi (2023)  raise major concerns about privacy, security, and social equity. There are some doubts about the ability of AI-enabled software and decision algorithms to predict human behavior and make just decisions regarding recruitment and resource allocation. Such technologies' inherent bias and lack of transparency and accountability could result in flawed and discriminatory practices (Mhlanga, 2022 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). There are also concerns that smart cities could exacerbate the digital divide, gentrification, and marginalization of low-income groups (Blasi et al., 2022 ; Kolotouchkina, Barroso, & SÃ¡nchez, 2022 ; Kourtit, Elmlund, & Nijkamp, 2020 ; Lam & Ma, 2019 ). Toli and Murtagh (2020)  argue that it is unclear whether smart solutions benefit a specific âelitistâ part of society or prioritize a certain societal group that is digitally skilled or can afford these solutions over others. There are also concerns that the increasing reliance on automation could have implications for old jobs (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). Such concerns need attention since problems such as digital exclusion and digital divide exist even in developed countries (Acilar & SÃ¦bÃ¸, 2023 ; Elena-Bucea, Cruz-Jesus, Oliveira, & Coelho, 2021 ; Skill, Wihlborg, & Kaharevic, 2020 ). The conditions are likely to be worse in developing countries. Context-sensitive and locally-driven smart city initiatives and technological transfer to developing countries are essential to ensure smart technologies will not worsen inequalities between developed and developing countries (Mhlanga, 2022 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ).  3.2.6 SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities Cities have the unique ability to catalyze significant societal changes by fostering connections between sustainable development and technological innovation. The widespread urbanization and growth of smart solutions are global trends that have the potential to greatly impact our way of life in unprecedented ways (Jain, Gue, & Jain, 2023 ). The importance of developing innovative solutions to address sustainable development challenges is evident in SDG 11 (Alagirisamy & Ramesh, 2022 ; Tura & Ojanen, 2022 ). Indeed, advanced ICT is instrumental in protecting the environment, optimizing resource efficiency, upgrading infrastructure, promoting socio-economic development, and advancing human knowledge in cities (Grossi & Trunova, 2021 ; Visvizi & del Hoyo, 2021a, 2021b ). Advanced ICT and IoT offer cutting-edge solutions for optimizing and enhancing the sustainability of urban areas. This includes improving various aspects related to urban planning, design, operations, and governance. The integration of ICT/IoT in sustainable cities addresses the growing requirement for novel approaches to achieve long-term environmental sustainability and address challenges such as air pollution, safety, resource management, etc. (Almalki et al., 2021 ; Sharifi, Khavarian-Garmsir, Allam, & Asadzadeh, 2023 ). These solutions are associated with inclusivity, safety, resilience, efficiency, equity, and quality of life as key objectives of SDG 11. Despite these merits, as Powell (2021)  warns, the optimization approach may overlook social and environmental concerns and restrict citizen involvement in shaping innovative city projects. Smart city solutions enabled by big data analytics could help cities deal with complex and dynamic interactions between different factors that are not easily addressed by static and linear models (Kourtit et al., 2020 ). Technologies such as drone-based sensing, deep learning, data sensing and analytics, Blockchain, and AI-enabled real-time monitoring of urban functions (e.g., energy and water consumption) are necessary for optimizing urban management and enhancing resilience, as shown in different cities such as Casablanca, New Delhi, and New Castle (Corbett & Mellouli, 2017 ; Parmentola et al., 2022 ; Thangavelu, 2020 ). Similarly, 3D urban environment models contribute to an enhanced understanding of urban phenomena such as pollution, flood risk, land use, urban form, and even socio-economic features (Santos, Deus, Rocha, & TenedÃ³rio, 2021 ; Wang, Hou, Miller, Brown, & Jiang, 2019 ). Nevertheless, arguments regarding the positive implications of big data analytics have not been uniformly affirmative, and some concerns have also been raised. For instance, Rittenbruch et al. (2022)  delve into critiquing big data analytics and indicate that tensions exist between transparency and opacity, accuracy and uncertainty, and objectivity and subjectivity. They emphasize the necessity for algorithmic accountability, which is a significant mechanism for ensuring augmented transparency and confidence. A sector that has received much attention within the context of SDG 11 is urban mobility. Cryptocurrency-based car- and bike-sharing platforms such as FiarBike have been developed to promote shared mobility. Such platforms can also be used to collect finance for the maintenance and further development of shared mobility infrastructure. Other smart solutions, such as smartphone apps, have also contributed to the promotion of active and public transportation (Garber, Watkins, & Kramer, 2019 ; Mora et al., 2021 ). Smart solutions could also facilitate modal shift via car- and bike-sharing programs, reduce the need for travel and commuting by promoting online shopping and automated delivery, and improve the safety of pedestrians and cyclists by using sensors (El Hamdani, Benamar, & Younis, 2020 ; Huang, Thomas, Groenewolt, & van Berkum, 2022 ; Moreno et al., 2021 ). Collectively, these could promote proximity-based urban planning and active transportation with co-benefits for health and climate change mitigation (Moreno et al., 2021 ; Sharifi, Pathak, Joshi, & He, 2021 ). Automated transport is another key feature of smart cities. If planned and implemented properly and by considering urban-rural linkages, it can strengthen the connection between cities and their hinterland and promote regional growth (Soe, 2020 ). Well-planned automated transport could also enhance the accessibility of women, children, and the elderly. It can also improve road safety and reduce the environmental impacts of cities by decreasing the number of vehicles on roads and associated CO2  emissions (Grindsted, Christensen, Freudendal-Pedersen, Friis, & Hartmann-Petersen, 2022 ; Soe, 2020 ). However, poor implementation of transport automation will have negative effects as it could increase congestion and emissions (Grindsted et al., 2022 ; Soe, 2020 ). Some argue that Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are likely to generate rebound effects and increase car dependence, thereby increasing emissions and negatively impacting human health (Blasi et al., 2022 ; Grindsted et al., 2022 ). Integrating AVs with MaaS and Public transport policies could mitigate these issues (Grindsted et al., 2022 ). Indeed, AVs could further promote car sharing (Grindsted et al., 2022 ). Smart technologies have the potential to both enhance and adversely impact urban governance. Better interaction between people and urban authorities can be achieved through blockchain-based platforms that are less bureaucratic and can enhance citizen trust as the security of data collected via smart IoT tools and stored in blockchain platforms can be ensured. Such platforms further optimize interactions by enhancing speed and efficiency and minimizing corruption through traceability features (Mora et al., 2021 ). Urban authorities can use blockchain to collect taxes more efficiently and also verify information sent by taxpayers, thereby increasing municipalities' revenues (Makani, Pittala, Alsayed, Aloqaily, & Jararweh, 2022 ; Mora et al., 2021 ). However, on the dark side, Sheikh, Mitchell, and Foth (2023)  point out that smart technologies can have negative implications for urban governance by prioritizing efficiency and data collection over the well-being of diverse species and ecosystems. According to the authors, this can shift attention away from the needs and perspectives of nonhuman life and may delay actions toward sustainable development. Smart cities could also cause issues such as disempowerment, marginalization, social exclusion, discrimination, governance corporatization, algorithmic bias, technocratic reductionism, techno-centricity, dataveillance, geosurveillance, privacy loss, cybersecurity risks, and democratic backsliding. These have been exacerbated following the COVID-19 pandemic due to the massive deployment of invasive technologies. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 crisis provides a great window of opportunity for policymakers to undertake transformative endeavors toward creating more just, resilient, safe, and sustainable cities (Amirzadeh, Sobhaninia, Buckman, & Sharifi, 2023 ; Sharifi, 2023 ; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2020 ).  3.2.7 SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production SDG 12 is at the heart of natural environment and resources management for driving sustainable economic development. This implies that it is strongly linked to multiple SDGs, including SDGs 11, 13, 7, and 9. It is of particular importance in global efforts to achieve environmental sustainability. SDG 12 has stimulated many opportunities for innovation under the âsustainable innovationâ agenda. In this regard, new technologies play a crucial role in optimizing the utilization of natural resources and advancing our understanding and prevention of environmental issues. Smart cities rely on ICT and its applied innovative solutions to monitor, understand, analyze, and plan resource consumption patterns across different urban systems and domains (Charfeddine & Umlai, 2023 ; Irajifar, Chen, Lak, Sharifi, & Cheshmehzangi, 2023 ). These efforts also contribute to achieving climate goals associated with SGD13 (Charfeddine & Umlai, 2023 ; Ismagilova et al., 2019 ). The smart city approach based on the use of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and related automated processes is highly significant to advancing the model of Circular Economy (CE). For instance: the optimization of wastewater management can be enabled by the automation of the harvested rainwater collection in buildings, smart grid technologies can contribute to circularity through energy reduction and conservation using different means, product utilization can be maximized through pool sharing, e-waste can be reduced through replacement cycle and refurbishment, and recycled plastic waste can be boosted through virtual platforms (Siddiqui & Pandit, 2021 ). Smart solutions can contribute to sustainable consumption and production by improving solid waste management (Pardini, Rodrigues, Kozlov, Kumar, & Furtado, 2019 ). In this regard, Hannan et al. (2020)  proposed a mixed-integer linear programming model utilizing Fixed Routing Optimization and Variable Routing Optimization for the optimization of solid waste collection (SWC). They focused on using bin monitoring as a smart solution to shift from a fixed route solid waste collection planning to variable route planning. Their study showed considerable optimization benefits with implications for multiple SDGs, including SDGs 7, 11, 12, and 13. Speaking of SDG 7 and its relation to SDG 13, Bibri and Krogstie (2020)  investigated the innovative role of data-driven smart solutions in the context of smart cities. They found that the combined use and consideration of smart grids, smart meters, smart buildings and appliances, smart environmental monitoring, and smart urban metabolism can yield synergetic benefits. The benefits include energy efficiency improvement, renewable energy adoption, pollution reduction, and real-time energy and material flow feedback. For example, smart metering infrastructure can contribute to responsible consumption by optimizing consumers' energy consumption behaviors (Liaqat et al., 2021 ). Worth pointing out is that urban metabolism (UM) is of central focus in CE as a model that is used to understand and analyze the energy and material flow in urban environments. UM refers to âthe total sum of the technical and socioeconomic processes that occur in cities, resulting in growth, production of energy, and elimination of waste.â (Kennedy, Cuddihy, & Engel-Yan, 2007 ). Smart urban metabolism (SUM) is an evolution of urban metabolism enabled by advanced ICT (see Bibri and Krogstie (2020)  for a case study analysis and a detailed discussion). Further, one dimension of UM is the use of dynamic and high-resolution meter data for the evaluation of energy consumption and waste production in buildings. This involves the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a tool for improving efficiency and reducing waste. For instance, BIM helps reduce construction waste (Liu et al., 2021 ). As an innovative technology, BIM can be used to enhance design efficiency and quality, collaboration between stakeholders, data exchange, design communication, and information sharing (Liu et al., 2021 ; Pereira, Santos, Leite, & EscÃ³rcio, 2021 ). Blockchain technology can also contribute to SDG 12. Its novelty lies in enabling new methods for green energy production, âmonitoring and storing data related activities responsible for pollution and environmental degradation, and real-time collection and analysis of green or low carbon data for timely decision makingâ (Parmentola et al., 2022 ). Further, it can oversee the groundwater of urban areas, monitor EV charging systems (Parmentola et al., 2022 ), inform âconsumers about less-efficient appliances in their premisesâ (Liaqat et al., 2021 ), and monitor compliance with sustainability standards. The latter can be achieved through product traceability which can also reduce resource inefficiencies and losses at the different stages of supply chain (Mora et al., 2021 ). Despite these benefits, the high energy requirements for AI applications in the case of the use of non carbon-neutral sources of energy could undermine the efforts to achieve the goal of Climate Action (SDG 13) (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ).  3.2.8 SDG 13: Climate action SDG 13 on climate action pertains particularly to cities as major contributors to GHG emissions (Aboagye & Sharifi, 2023, 2024 ; Lwasa et al., 2022 ). According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), enabling city governments to effectively handle data management challenges will be crucial in achieving the decarbonization agenda. While the nexus between ICT and climate change has been a topic of great interest since the early 2000s, it was not until recently that it became important in the context of smart cities. This nexus spans various urban domains associated with high emission levels, such as transportation, energy, building, industry, and waste. Bibri and Krogstie (2020)  provide a set of data-driven strategies and pathways for energy efficiency and pollution reduction as solutions for advancing the environmental sustainability of smart cities. These are based on the overarching strategy âresource efficiency and climate responsibilityâ that is to be adopted by sustainable smart cities that aim to reduce GHG emissions to a level below 1 ton per inhabitant by 2030 and to become fossil fuel-free and climate-positive by 2050. This entails reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint as well as using digitalization and ânew technologies to make it easier for citizens and businesses to be environmentally friendly.â Regarding emerging models of urbanism, Moreno et al. (2021)  emphasize the potential role of digitalization in improving the different sustainability aspects of the 15-Minute city, as digital technologies have the potential to enable cities to optimize and improve service delivery by significantly reducing the time needed for citizens to accomplish social functions, thereby saving time from mobility and traffic and hence reducing emissions from vehicles which in turn save urban environments. The 15-minute city model can also offer multiple other co-benefits for economic, environmental, and social sustainability (Khavarian-Garmsir, Sharifi, Hajian Hossein Abadi, & Moradi, 2023 ; Khavarian-Garmsir, Sharifi, & Sadeghi, 2023 ). AI and other advanced technologies for modeling and monitoring have also shown great potential for waste collection optimization through fixed and variable routing optimization (Hannan et al., 2020 ). This also has significant benefits for multiple SDGs, namely SDGs 3, 6, 11, and 14, both directly and indirectly (Hannan et al., 2020 ). AI applications have the potential to contribute greatly to environmental sustainability. They can analyze large-scale databases, allowing for joint actions in preserving the environment. AI can also help improve our understanding of climate change and model its potential impacts. Additionally, it enables high integration of renewable energy sources and smart energy systems, enhancing ecosystem health and supporting circular economies. Furthermore, AI aids in creating efficient resource usage within low-carbon cities (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). Such contributions also provide co-benefits for SDGs 7, 11, and 13 (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, data sharing among consumers and third parties enables novel services, such as energy management, which support low-carbon practices and options. Also, data sharing among third parties and other stakeholders enables innovative services for smart cities and helps achieve the objectives of sustainable development and decarbonization (Liaqat et al., 2021 ). As regards blockchain, a number of solutions have been proposed or developed, including its use to address and improve the management of the emission trading and auditing schemes (Lu et al., 2022 ; Parmentola et al., 2022 ), to provide credible trading services for polluters (Parmentola et al., 2022 ), to facilitate public participation in addressing the challenges of climate change, and to tokenize carbon credits (Mora et al., 2021 ). Concerning emission monitoring, the integration of blockchain and the IoT provides reliability to the available data and establishes the homogeneity of measurement criteria, which in turn âminimize registration errors and eliminate fraud arising from the accounting and measurement of gas emissionsâ (Mora et al., 2021 ). In terms of trade-offs, the use of advanced ICT involves direct effects on the environment. In this respect, large computing centers, which provide massive computational resources required by AI technology research, design, and development, are associated with significant energy consumption and, thus, carbon footprint, compromising SDGs 7 and 13 (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). Moreover, the domination of technocratic approaches in planning systems is criticized by some scholars, like Yigitcanlar, Foth, and Kamruzzaman (2019) , who noted that focusing solely on these approaches in urban innovation has left planning systems ill-equipped to address underlying environmental issues. Therefore, comprehensive reform in governance and politics is necessary to advance urban innovations. In this regard, Fieuw, Foth, and Caldwell (2022)  advocate for moving beyond a narrow focus on technological solutions and instead adopting a more systemic approach that addresses the root causes of climate change, such as social and economic inequality, unsustainable consumption patterns, and the exploitation of natural resources. They argue that this approach can help promote multispecies justice and cohabitation and lead to more equitable and sustainable urban environments for all. Overall, ICT can pose risks to environmental sustainability. These risks go beyond direct effects, also encompassing indirect effects, systemic effects, and rebound effects.  3.2.9 Key issues related to other SDGs 3.2.9.1 SDG 1 The other SDGs have received relatively less attention in the literature. However, the reported evidence shows that smart city solutions and technologies can also be linked to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 15, 15, 16, and 17. It is possible to infer from the reviewed literature that smart city solutions and technologies can indirectly contribute to alleviating poverty (SDG 1). It is argued that ICT infrastructure and artificial intelligence could lead to economic growth and facilitate the provision of food and other services, thereby contributing to poverty eradication (Joia & Kuhl, 2019 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). Policymakers can utilize mart solutions such as big data analytics and image processing to identify poverty areas, find out the root causes of poverty, and explore scenarios for empowering vulnerable groups by ensuring better access to resources and services (Ismagilova et al., 2019 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). Efficiency improvement and operational optimization are other contributions that could help address poverty issues. However, inequality trade-offs may emerge if smart cities are not implemented following the principles of social justice (Joia & Kuhl, 2019 ).  3.2.9.2 SDG 2 Smart city technologies could also contribute to minimizing hunger (SDG 2) through innovative planning approaches, especially in relation to developing countries. Among other things, smart technologies can contribute to reducing food waste (Ahmadzadeh, Ajmal, Ramanathan, & Duan, 2023 ; Varghese et al., 2021 ), promoting innovation and behavioral change (Baena et al., 2020 ), and enabling more efficient data-driven ways of agricultural production, biodiversity protection, food conservation, crop forecasting, and soil management, all of which are essential for achieving zero hunger (Ryan et al., 2020 ). Achieving such contributions depends on the availability of just and effective governance mechanisms. Otherwise, the uneven distribution of smart technologies, such as AI-enabled agricultural equipment, would make it challenging to reduce hunger, particularly in developing countries (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ).  3.2.9.3 SDG 4 Smart technologies are increasingly used to ensure quality education in cities. The decentralization features of technologies such as Blockchain offer opportunities to improve access to education services and learning materials. Smart technologies are also becoming increasingly important in managing, improving, and evaluating educational systems. These technologies offer a range of tools and techniques that can support these processes effectively (Nikitin, Lantsev, Nugaev, & Yakovleva, 2016 ; Spector, 2016 ). Other potential contributions are minimizing private education costs, facilitating self-learning and creative education, enabling e-learning, and providing life-long education opportunities (Iqbal, Parra-Saldivar, Zavala-Yoe, & Ramirez-Mendoza, 2020 ). Despite multiple potential contributions, equality remains a major constraint on access to platforms enabled by smart technologies. Digital accessibility should be enhanced to minimize quality trade-offs pertinent to SDG 4.  3.2.9.4 SDG 5 Gender equality (SDG 5), inclusion/exclusion, and access are areas where the conflicts among the global agendas of SDGs are particularly evident in the context of smart cities (Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken, 2020 ). Hatuka and Zur (2020)  argue that the initiatives that address inequality in smart cities are still at the margins, calling for shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives and cultivating smart social urbanism. In particular, achieving the objectives of SDG 5 entails improving the use of ICT as a set of enabling technologies to promote the empowerment of women and adopting and strengthening sound policies that promote gender equality. One major trade-off mentioned in the literature is regarding the potential reproduction of social biases against women by machine-learning algorithms that rely on information available online (Lo Piano, 2020 ; Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). Better training of such algorithms is needed to avoid such issues. Diversifying the AI workforce and better inclusion of women could also be helpful (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ).  3.2.9.5 SDG 9 Smart cities offer unparalleled opportunities for the attainment of SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), as they provide platforms that allow diverse innovations to emerge and be advanced. These innovations boost the urban economy and benefit multiple sectors, including industry and infrastructure (Ismagilova et al., 2020 ). Among different smart technologies, Blockchain has been highlighted in the literature for its capacity to enable green production and facilitate greener supply chain and logistics (Parmentola et al., 2022 ). It can also strengthen the innovative capacity of low-income economies by offering innovative finance and banking models where, for instance, people in developed countries can provide small loans to small and medium enterprises in developing countries using cryptocurrencies (Mora et al., 2021 ). However, investing in resilient infrastructure and implementing industrial innovation could be costly, making it challenging for local governments to achieve other goals. W. Powell, Foth, Cao, and Natanelov (2022)  identify several challenges associated with using blockchain technology. They warn that significant volumes of energy are required to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain, which can have negative environmental impacts. Another challenge is the lack of standardization and interoperability between different blockchain systems, which can limit their effectiveness in achieving sustainable development goals. Additionally, there is a need for greater awareness and understanding of blockchain technology among stakeholders, including policymakers, businesses, and communities, to ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner. These are key trade-offs that need to be addressed.  3.2.9.6 SDG 14 Through its innovative solutions, smart cities can provide tools for carefully managing resources that regulate human needs, including water resources. Among other things, AI can play a key role in preventing and reducing marine pollution through the automatic identification techniques enabled by emerging powerful algorithms (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). Coastal waters are being continuously polluted, exacerbating the detrimental effects of ocean acidification on ecosystems and biodiversity. This pollution is negatively impacting small-scale fisheries (UN, 2022 ). To address some of these issues, blockchain mechanisms are being implemented âto monitor water pollution and preserve marine resourcesâ (Parmentola et al., 2022 ). Blockchain technology has been utilized in reward programs where fishermen or coastal residents are provided with cryptocurrency tokens. These tokens can be later exchanged for credit, enabling them to collect and share data regarding the environmental conditions of water bodies. This valuable information can contribute to improving decision-making processes, designing effective regulations, and supporting platforms dedicated to safeguarding coral reefs (Mora et al., 2021 ). Other potential contributions of smart solutions to SDG 14 are explained in Supplementary Appendix II.  3.2.9.7 SDG 15 Implementation of the smart city concept can help achieve the goals captured in SDG 15 (Life of Land), especially regarding halting and reversing land degradation and slowing biodiversity loss. However, our analysis showcases that there was no research work directly focused on SDG 15 (see Fig. 3 ). Notwithstanding, as detailed in Supplementary Appendix II, it can be argued that many activities and projects initiated in smart cities, particularly in sectors like transport, manufacturing, and energy, can have significant impacts on promoting the protection and restoration of various ecosystems such as terrestrial areas and forests. However, some of the smart city programs, such as the installation of city-wide lighting systems, as noted in the article by Tavares et al. (2021) , prompt negative impacts on different ecosystems, thus exposing the negative side of smart cities, especially in pursuit of SDGs 14, 15, 2, 3, and 6.  3.2.9.8 SDG 16 This goal is a critical goal for urban planning, as it can help streamline agendas such as governance, education, and livability. It emphasizes the need to build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions, which were often neglected in previous urban planning models. Justice and strong institutions are essential for tackling urban issues, such as human rights violations, violence, climate change, and cost of living, which have led to severe consequences such as human displacements and terrorism (Artusio et al., 2017 ). Smart technologies, such as Blockchain and AI, offer promising solutions for implementing SDG 16 in urban areas. For instance, Blockchain can provide credible platforms for registering and storing information related to vulnerable groups, while AI can enable e-voting and facial recognition for democratization and security (Allam, 2018 ; Ismagilova et al., 2020 ; Moura & Gomes, 2017 ). However, smart technologies also pose challenges and risks, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and corporate manipulation. Human interventions, especially through policies and regulatory frameworks, are required to complement the use of smart technologies and ensure their ethical and responsible application. Pre-emptive legislation is recommended to prevent the misuse of smart technologies that would compromise the achievement of SDG 16 in urban areas. Stronger institutions are also needed that adhere to transparency and accountability principles in deploying smart technologies in urban affairs (Truby, 2020 ). Overall, SDG 16 is a relevant and timely goal for urban planning, as well as an opportunity and a challenge for smart technologies. A balanced and integrated approach that combines smart technologies with human interventions is advocated to ensure urban sustainability, resilience, and innovation.  3.2.9.9 SDG 17 Regarding the Partnership for the Goals (SDG 17), the smart city agenda has the potential to engender key partnership aspects through an elaborate interconnectedness of services and actors, allowing residents, urban authorities, service providers, and other stakeholders to collaborate toward creating resilient social-ecological-technological systems (Ismagilova et al., 2019 ; Sharifi, 2023 ; Sharifi & Allam, 2021 ). According to Drapalova and Wegrich (2020) , the need for collaboration is important not only for the achievement of SDG 17 but for all the other individual SDGs. In cities, collaboration could be viewed via different dimensions, including technologies and innovations, sharing of information and data, and knowledge transfer. However, despite the promises, there has been an increasing concern regarding the lack of standardization of protocols and frameworks to guide the manufacturing and deployment of smart devices and objects (Sethi & Sarangi, 2017 ). As such, implementing smart cities has been expensive, as smart device manufacturers maintained their unique proprietary standards, meaning that other devices cannot be seamlessly integrated (Nelson, Toth, Linders, Nguyen, & Rhee, 2019 ). This is a key trade-off that needs attention.     4 Conclusions The world has experienced unprecedented growth in population during the past decades. In the meantime, climate change has become a key threat to human security. These phenomena have exacerbated numerous challenges, especially in the urban realm, prompting the global community to seek sustainable solutions. This motivated the introduction of the 17 SDGs in 2015. Long before the launch of the SDGs, there was an interest in the global arena in adopting smart solutions and technologies for solving global issues (Anthopoulos, 2017 ; Sharifi, Allam, Feizizadeh, & Ghamari, 2021 ). Protagonists of smart cities argue that smart solutions could solve a majority of urban challenges, with some arguing that they have the potential to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs (Joia & Kuhl, 2019 ). This systematic review demonstrated that responsible development and implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward sustainable development goals. Most studies examining the linkages have been published in the past two years, indicating that this field is emergent. Although indirect linkages between all SDGs and smart city solutions can be established, the analysis showed that the focus is mainly on SDGs 11, 12, 7, 6, and 4. More work on other SDGs is, therefore, needed. A key finding is a bias toward reporting positive contributions. This has also been highlighted in other studies related to SDGs (Vinuesa et al., 2020 ). As Table 1   shows, among other things, the benefits include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, enhancing managerial practices, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. Overall, in the literature, the benefits of smart cities outweigh the trade-offs. However, we found that potential trade-offs and challenges related to privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, the risk of the increased cost of living, the digital divide and lack of skills, rebound effects, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, and the limited legal setup can also occur. Overcoming the challenges requires government interventions and multi-scale governance mechanisms to ensure balanced growth and avoid disproportionate impacts on some societal groups. Developing standard and interoperable formats for secure data collection and exchange is one solution that could offer opportunities for the engagement of different groups and stakeholders in smart cities, thereby enhancing the prospect of contribution to SDGs (Liaqat et al., 2021 ). Stakeholder engagement and consultation could ensure that smart solutions can meet the needs of people. A key challenge is the potential misuse of AI and the risk of biased decision-making toward certain societal groups. Indeed, many smart solutions and technologies, such as those based on AI, are still in their incipient stages. Effective governance and regulatory measures are needed to ensure they will not undermine the achievement of SDGs (Truby, 2020 ). Preventing this requires transparency with algorithms and training programs (Truby, 2020 ), government interventions to ensure that AI is human-centered (Mhlanga, 2022 ), developing ethical standards and regular auditing to ensure compliance with them, and measures to regulate surveillance technologies and practices of governments and corporations (Truby, 2020 ). The COVID-19 crisis and other syndemics will have far-reaching implications for surveillance society, with potential implications for achieving SDGs. As Kitchin (2020)  argued, this crisis âwas an opportunity for the state to further roll-out and normalize surveillance technologies and there is little sense that the tracking implemented there will be rolled-back post-crisis.â The surveillance system deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic will become part of the ânew normalâ in digitally monitoring and governing societies. This may result in mass surveillance practiced mainly by big tech companies and in legitimating tyranny by democratic states, thereby eroding civil liberties related to privacy and democracy. At the core of the ânew normalâ is the intensification of the hyper-connectivity, datafication, algorithmization, and platformization of the social organization resulting from all kinds of interactions and activities that citizens perform as part of everyday life in smart cities. Platformization refers to âthe penetration of infrastructures, economic processes, and governmental frameworks of digital platforms in different economic sectors and spheres of life, as well as the reorganization of cultural practices and imaginations around these platformsâ (Poell et al., 2019 ). Platforms as an ideological formation are associated with smart cities and sharing economy (Barta & Neff, 2016 ). They steer both platform-based user interactions as well as economic transactions (Poell et al., 2019 ), which are associated with the governance dimension of platformization (Gorwa, 2019 ). Major companies have actively repurposed their platforms and data to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future syndemics. For instance, Google, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft have developed initiatives to monitor the effects of interventionist measures globally and facilitate contact tracing. They have also generated and shared real-time location and mobility data (Brandom & Robertson, 2020 ; Kitchin, 2020 ). However, some criticisms underscore the concerns surrounding the involvement of these big companies in public health measures and the potential implications for governance and autonomy. For instance, some scholars criticized the Google-Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework for promoting a technocratic solution and challenging state sovereignty (Mann et al., 2022 ; Mann, Mitchell, Foth, & Anastasiu, 2020 ). Overall, the emergence of these solutionist technologies has led to the development of new approaches in management and governance. In fact, the utilization of surveillance technologies has made social and spatial sorting more commonplace. A rigid techno-dystopian stance is one of the socio-spatial implications of platform-mediated urban everyday life and urban futures (StrÃ¼ver & Bauriedl, 2022 ). Indeed, the new routines of social and spatial sorting have âthe potential to permanently shift the nature of governmentality and to also act as a pathway towards authoritarian forms of governance where technology is used to actively impose the will of the state onto citizensâ (Kitchin, 2020 ). This has entrenched the wrong idea that the techno-managerialist mode of governing by code in smart cities is the only option to go, with no alternative scenario. It has been promoted as the most effective and efficient way to manage citizens through the systemic collection and algorithmic processing of data for decision-making purposes that exclude political action. These forms of algorithmic technocratic governance are set to cement and normalize the governmental logic of capture and control instead of surveillance and discipline. Regulatory frameworks and transparency of algorithms are, therefore, essential and should be prioritized. There are also examples of more citizen-centric and community-oriented governance alternatives that should be followed to ensure smart solutions contribute to creating livable and sustainable cities (Foth, Anastasiu, Mann, & Mitchell, 2021 ; Mattern & De, 2021 ; Powell, 2021 ). With its multifarious consequences, it is evident that the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis will not fade any time soon and will be felt in our ways of living and working in cities. In fact, it is already shown that the pandemic has slowed down progress toward SDGs (De Las Heras et al., 2020a, 2020b ). This calls for the need to critically investigate or engage with smart urbanism regarding how it may shape urban futures and its evolution to platform urbanism and its development in response to this crisis. It is also important to address issues such as social exclusion, discrimination, dataveillance, geosurveillance, privacy erosion, mind control, and democratic decay (Bibri & Allam, 2022 ). Especially this crisis has worsened the effects of big tech companies getting involved in data policies and public trust in data governance through the accelerated adoption of digital technologies (Li, Ma, & Wu, 2022 ). Consequently, from an ethical perspective, âmost of the policies, regulations, legislations, and auditing mechanisms created and established in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic are of a destructive nature and directed towards stripping away people from their natural and constitutional rightsâ (Bibri & Allam, 2022 ). This review calls for a better investigation of these issues and their implications for achieving SDGs in future studies. This will be essential to ensure that the economic ambitions pursued via the deployment of smart cities will be aligned with SDGs. Other key research gaps related to the interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs that need to be addressed in future research include: implications of platformization for achieving SDGs; trade-offs for understudied SDGs such as SDG No. 14 and SDG NO. 17; and trade-offs beyond issues related to costs, equity, and energy efficiency. Also, it is important to mention that interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs are not just limited to co-benefits and trade-offs. Synergies and conflicts are two other important types of interactions that should also be examined. Synergies could occur when the simultaneous implementation of smart city solutions and SDG efforts could lead to greater benefits than when they are implemented separately. In contrast, conflict, while not common, refers to a situation when the simultaneous implementation of these two could be difficult. Examining synergies and conflicts allow for obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of interactions between smart cities and SDGs. Finally, as existing research is mainly conceptual and theoretical, it is important to do more empirical research on the interactions between smart cities and SDGs.
