                  Achieving global food security and ensuring sustainable agriculture, the dual objectives of the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2), necessitate immediate and collaborative efforts from developing and developed nations. The adverse effects of ozone on crop yields have the potential to significantly undermine the United Nations' ambitious target of attaining food security and ending hunger by 2030. This review examines the causes of growing tropospheric ozone, especially in India and China which lead to a substantial reduction in crop yield and forest biomass. The findings show that a nexus of high population, rapid urbanization and regional pollution sources aggravates the problem in these countries. It elucidates that when plants are exposed to ozone, specific cellular pathways are triggered, resulting in changes in the expression of genes related to hormone production, antioxidant metabolism, respiration, and photosynthesis. Assessing the risks associated with ozone exposure involves using response functions that link exposure-based and flux-based measurements to variables like crop yield. Precisely quantifying the losses in yield and economic value in food crops due to current ozone levels is of utmost importance in comprehending the risks ozone poses to global food security. We conclude that policymakers should focus on implementing measures to decrease the emissions of ozone precursors, such as enhancing vehicle fuel efficiency standards and promoting the use of cleaner energy sources. Additionally, efforts should be directed toward mapping or developing crop varieties that can tolerate ozone, applying protective measures at critical stages of plant growth and establishing ozone-related vegetation protection standards.

Handling Editor: Volker Matthias Achieving global food security and ensuring sustainable agriculture, the dual objectives of the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2), necessitate immediate and collaborative efforts from developing and developed nations. The adverse effects of ozone on crop yields have the potential to significantly undermine the United Nations' ambitious target of attaining food security and ending hunger by 2030. This review examines the causes of growing tropospheric ozone, especially in India and China which lead to a substantial reduction in crop yield and forest biomass. The findings show that a nexus of high population, rapid urbanization and regional pollution sources aggravates the problem in these countries. It elucidates that when plants are exposed to ozone, specific cellular pathways are triggered, resulting in changes in the expression of genes related to hormone production, antioxidant metabolism, respiration, and photosynthesis. Assessing the risks associated with ozone exposure involves using response functions that link exposure-based and flux-based measurements to variables like crop yield. Precisely quantifying the losses in yield and economic value in food crops due to current ozone levels is of utmost importance in comprehending the risks ozone poses to global food security. We conclude that policymakers should focus on implementing measures to decrease the emissions of ozone precursors, such as enhancing vehicle fuel efficiency standards and promoting the use of cleaner energy sources. Additionally, efforts should be directed toward mapping or developing crop varieties that can tolerate ozone, applying protective measures at critical stages of plant growth and establishing ozone-related vegetation protection standards.

The provision of food is therefore central to society and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) is to achieve zero hunger and food security by 2030 (Dias et al., 2019 ). Statistics show that human hunger is rising, with 735 million people undernourished in 2022. It is a daunting challenge that food remains available, affordable, and accessible to the diverse sections of the population residing in both rural and urban areas. At the centre of the effectuation of the 2030 plan to achieve SDG 2, it is evident that the world is not on the road to meeting it. Forecasts demonstrate that by 2030, almost 8% of the world's population, or 600 million people will be chronically undernourished (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2023 ). There has been an improvement in achieving some targets, however, the overall progress is either too slow or has fallen back. Consistent efforts are being made to close the yield gap and produce more food to nourish the world's growing population (Long et al., 2015 ). Between 2000 and 2019 the global harvested area of primary crops went up by 21% to 1.4 billion ha. Pressure to dramatically increase agricultural yield has led to a shift from traditional to intensive farming. This largely depends on industrial agro-inputs, such as machinery, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers. Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) statistics show that in 2019, agricultural use of inorganic fertilisers reached 190 million tonnes and pesticide use went up 36% between 2000 and 2019. During the same period, the primary crop production (sugarcane, maize, wheat, and rice) increased by around 53%, while the production of vegetable oil and meat went up by 118 and 44 %, respectively (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, 2021 ). Industrial agriculture has led to food surpluses in some parts of the world, but it has also increased our overdependence on fossil fuels and caused widespread environmental damage (Shiferaw et al., 2020 ). Agricultural systems are facing an intimidating task to satisfy a rising food demand while addressing sustainability issues and facing resource constraints, including limited land suitable for growing food (Grote et al., 2021 ). Many factors limit the achievement of SDG 2 as shown in Fig. 1  A. A growing world population has increased concerns about food security. Fig. 1 B shows the prevalence of food insecurity in different regions of the world compared to the annual rate of population growth from 2015 to 2020. In several regions of the world especially in developing countries like India, China, and South Africa a rapid population growth aggravates the objective of ending hunger and warranting that all people have sufficient access to food. According to a United Nations report published in 2021, the world population has more than tripled in size, increasing from around 2.5 million in 1950 to about 7.9 billion in 2021. By 2030, the target year for the accomplishment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the size of the global population is anticipated to increase to 8.5 billion. It is projected to continue rising to around 9.7 billion in 2050 and 10.9 billion in 2100 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2021 ). An extensive shift towards diets with higher reliance on meat, increasing pollution, warming trends, higher demand for food stuff, higher input prices, soil degradation, and increasing competition for land and water from non-food uses are other factors expected to render the world's food supply even more vulnerable. Climate change is anticipated to have an escalating effect on reducing yields, which is supported by statistical analysis of crop yield data suggesting that its effects may already be underway (Challinor et al., 2014 ). The distribution and behaviour of species are shifting due to global warming brought on by greenhouse gas emissions, which will eventually have an impact on agricultural production. One of the major threats to global food production with ramifications for future food security is air pollution (Sillmann et al., 2021 ; Wei and Wang, 2021 ). Air pollution can harm agricultural production and shift the equilibrium of food markets. Besides, the health effects caused by air pollution would reduce worker productivity and indirectly threaten the food supply (. Sun et al., 2017 ). Both particulate matter and gaseous air pollutants are major threats to crop production. Particulates like sulphates, nitrates, dust, and heavy metals can accumulate in the food chain by diffusion, settling, and precipitation, and consequently harm plants and animals. Among various air pollutants, tropospheric ozone (O3 ) is particularly damaging to crop yields (Ainsworth et al., 2020 ; Lal et al., 2017 ; Mahmood et al., 2020 ). There are diverse consequences of the effect of ozone on plants. It adversely affects natural vegetation and has unavoidably huge monetary consequences for horticulture, agriculture, and forestry (Juráň et al., 2021 ). It damages the productivity of crops, thereby diminishing the worldwide production of food. Chuwah et al. observed that a 2.5% increase in farmland area worldwide and a regional growth of 8.9% in Asia would be needed to make up for output losses brought on by O3  (Chuwah et al., 2015 ). Increased ozone may further lead to decreased biodiversity (Lal et al., 2017 ) and diminished uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) by plants, thereby increasing global warming. This paper aims to contribute valuable insights into ozone concentrations across various regions of the globe, the mechanism of ozone uptake by plants, and the physiological and biochemical response to ozone. It examines the distinctive challenges that countries in South Asia and East Asia especially India and China face that amplify the consequences of ozone pollution on crop yield and also delves into potential measures that these countries, along with other developing nations, can implement to mitigate this issue. It compiles a list of the most often used O3  metrics for assessing plant damage and offers a comparative analysis of various concentration-based methods with each other and with flux-based metrics. It also provides a summary of crop yield loss estimates and associated economic losses, which are critical concerns for ensuring food security. Furthermore, it intends to facilitate the development and implementation of future policies to reduce emissions of ozone precursors and establish agriculture-based ozone standards. It explores approaches to enhancing ozone tolerance in plants, which will form bases for forthcoming research to achieve a sustainable food system that ensures everyone has access to sufficient nutritious food.  2 Ozone pollution and crop productivity Surface ozone is a strong oxidant gas that is estimated to kill one million people a year worldwide and significantly reduce crop yield and forest biomass (Feng et al., 2019a ,2019b ; Malley et al., 2017 ). Compared to 2000, there were 46% more deaths globally in 2019 due to ozone (Malashock et al., 2022 ). Effects on human health include premature mortality due to cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Balakrishnan et al., 2019 ; Pandey et al., 2021 ). The detrimental impacts of surface ozone on forests, grasslands, and crops have been well documented in decades of research (Dingenen et al., 2009 ;. Emberson et al., 2018 ; Sampedro et al., 2020 ). Besides, O3  pollution is projected to be more damaging to global food production than climate change (Fischer, 2019 ; Schauberger et al., 2019 ). 2.1 Production Surface ozone is a spatially and temporally dynamic air pollutant and also a powerful greenhouse gas. Most O3  in the atmosphere is present in the stratosphere where it absorbs UV radiation but O3  is also present in the troposphere where it is a pollutant. Ozone is a secondary pollutant as it is not emitted directly from anthropogenic sources. It is produced through photochemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx ), methane (CH4 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). NOx , CO, and volatile organic compounds are primary pollutants and can travel far from their sources before O3  is formed, resulting in regional, intercontinental, and even hemispheric transport of O3  (Monks et al., 2015 )NO2 + ℎv  → NO + O   O + O2  → O3  (Ozone from nitrogen oxides)   CO+2O2 + ℎv  → CO2 + O3  (Ozone from carbon monoxide)   CH4 +4O2 + ℎv  → HCHO + O3 +H2 O (Ozone from methane)   RH+4O2 + ℎv  → RCHO + O3 +H2 O (Ozone from NMVOCs)    The major natural sources of precursors of ozone are soil, natural fires, vegetation, lightning, and wetlands and anthropogenic sources are transport, power stations, and industrial and combustion processes (Dewan and Lakhani, 2022 ).  2.2 Ozone concentration Ozone exposure is growing worldwide and considerably weighing down public health (Malashock et al., 2022 ; Ziemke et al., 2019 ). As a result of human-caused emissions, the levels of tropospheric ozone have increased from around 10 ppb in the late 1800s to current monthly average daytime concentrations that surpass 40–50 ppb (Monks et al., 2015 ). The annual average ambient ozone concentrations relative to the new World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines were exceeded in many parts of the world in 2019 (Health Effects Institute, 2022 ) (Fig. S2 ). In the Arctic troposphere during the spring, where ozone is destroyed by interactions with halogens, very low ozone mixing ratios are observed (Schultz et al., 2017 ). The distribution of ozone across the globe is not consistent over land surfaces, and in regions with temperate climates and seasonal variations, concentrations typically remain low during the cold winter months and increase during the warmer summer months (Schultz et al., 2017 ; . Wang et al., 2017 ). Trends in ozone exhibit regional deviation due to variations in solar radiation, temperature, and the amount of ozone precursors (Archibald et al., 2020 ; Yan et al., 2023 ; Yan et al., 2018 ). Ozone concentrations in industrialised nations that were previously high have now become stable or declined ( Lin et al., 2017 ; Pierre, 2021 ). This is attributed to stringent enforcement of regulatory limits on emissions of ozone precursors in Europe and the US (Ainsworth, 2017 ; Chuwah et al., 2015 ). On the contrary, many sites in East Asia are showing increasing ozone trends (Gao et al., 2020 ; Strode et al., 2019 ). In the northern hemisphere, the background concentrations of ozone have been observed to rise annually at a rate of 0.5–2% (Pierre, 2021 ; Ren et al., 2020 ) and are sufficiently high to cause vegetation and crop damage. Ozone concentrations fluctuate from approximately 20 ppb over parts of Australia and South America to 55–60 ppb in parts of Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and North America (Ainsworth, 2017 ). Ozone levels in rural areas are often reported to be more than in urban areas. The variation is due to the difference in proportions of two key ozone precursor: nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (Kumar and Sinha, 2021 ). In urban environments, the process of NOx  titration reduces ozone levels, while the emission of VOCs in suburban areas increases its formation (. Liu et al., 2020 ; Schultz et al., 2017 ). Moreover, the transportation of ozone and its precursors by long-range transport can increase the background concentrations of ozone at local and regional levels (Dewan and Lakhani, 2022 ; Monks et al., 2015 ; Sicard et al., 2017 ). In 2000, 89% of the cities in the world had more ozone levels than the WHO peak season ozone standard of 30 ppb, and their number amplified to 96% in 2019 (Malashock et al., 2022 ). Rapid industrialization and economic growth in Asia have led to increased ozone precursor pollutants and elevated concentrations (Mills et al., 2011 ). Asia is the world's largest emitter of NOx  and is projected to see a significant increase in its concentration in urban areas. High levels of ozone are found in different parts of South Asia and East Asia, like China and India (Dolker et al., 2023 ; Liu et al., 2022 ; Xu, 2021 ). Ozone concentrations were reported to be between 37.3 and 56.1 ppb over India, with the northern part having higher values. In India, the Indo-Gangetic Plain, which is highly populated, has the highest trend of growing ozone (3–5.6%) per decade, while southern India's increasing trend is 1.2–2% per decade (Singh and Agrawal, 2017 ). Ozone levels are expected to rise by 13% in many regions of India by 2050, mostly due to a rise in anthropogenic emissions (Pommier et al., 2018 ).  2.3 Rising concern: ozone pollution in India and China The rapid population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and increased transportation activities since the early 2000s in India and China have caused the emission of substantial quantities of precursors of ozone, such as NOx  and VOCs, which play a role in the generation of ground-level ozone (Gao et al., 2020 ; Mills and Hayes, 2017 ).A) Increasing Population    With 1432 and 1425 million inhabitants, respectively, India and China are currently the two most populated countries in the world (https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/ ) and home to over 35% of the global population. Fig. 2  A shows the percentage share of world population in India and China. Increased population is likely to weaken the food security in China and India (Molotoks et al., 2021 ; . Sun et al., 2023 ). Several studies indicate that ozone pollution in these two countries is on the rise (Oksanen et al., 2013 ; Pierre, 2021 ; Roy et al., 2009 ). In India, 973 million people cannot afford a healthy diet, while in China, the number stands at 169 million. India ranks 111 out of a total of 125 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 report with its progress against hunger nearly halted since 2015. Crucial staple crops such as soybeans, wheat, rice, maize, and subsistence crops like beans are highly vulnerable to ozone exposure. Ozone pollution in this region has sabotaged the global call to eliminate hunger and ensure food security (Feng et al., 2015 ). The decline in agricultural yield due to rising ozone has negatively impacted the food supply for approximately 95 million people in India (Ghude et al., 2014 ).B) Urbanisation and Industrialization    Urbanization stands out as one of the most significant human activities in the Anthropocene era. The issue of air pollution stemming from urbanization and industrialization is a significant global concern in many nations ( Liu et al., 2022 ). India and China seen significant urban growth, with millions relocating to cities. The growth rate of urban population in 2030 compared to 2000 is projected to increase by 121, 108 and 103% in China, India and South East Asia respectively (United Nations, Department of Economic, Social Affairs, 2019). Fig. 2 B shows the annual urban population of this region. This urban expansion has amplified the problem of pollution. In major urban clusters of China like the Pearl River Delta (PRD), the Beijing-Tianjin-Bohai Bay region, and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and urban cities in Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) like Delhi, Kanpur, Meerut, Agra, Patna, Varanasi a number of manufacturing centers and industrial units have evolved. The high energy consumption in these urban clusters exacerbates the problem of pollution. It has been observed that China's rapid economic growth and extensive land-area urbanisation has led to a rise in surface ozone concentrations from 2.9 to 8.5% ( Chen et al., 2020 ).C) Local sources and Transboundary Air Pollution    The escalation in the levels of O3  precursors has resulted in the emergence and extensive occurrence of O3  pollution. It has caused a deterioration in air quality in this region, disrupting the chemical and radiation balance in the lower atmosphere (David et al., 2019 ). The rise in NOx  emissions from East Asia and South Asia accounts for 29% of the overall increasing trend of average near surface ozone concentrations (Schultz et al., 2017 ). It poses a significant risk to both human health and food security. The emissions of NOx  and CO2  particularly in Northeast and Southeast Asia, have constituted more than 30% of the global total since 2008 scale (Akimoto et al., 2015 ). Between 1980 and 2003, NOx  emissions in Asia surged by more than 175%. In India, the annual increase in tropospheric NO2  levels doubled from 2002 to 2012. Rising NO2  concentrations in India (Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and New Delhi) and Pakistan (Lahore and Islamabad) have been reported (Kurokawa and Ohara, 2019 ). Fig. 2 C shows the NO2  concentration across the world. High levels of NO2  and HCHO (formaldehyde) were predominantly found in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) regions. Despite significant reductions in NOx  and CO emissions in China due to clean air initiatives implemented since 2010, emissions NMVOCs continue to rise, contributing to elevated O3  levels in the country (Zheng et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2020 ) as shown in Fig. 2 D. HCHO has been identified as a suitable proxy for measuring the reactivity of VOCs. India observed the highest concentration of annual averaged HCHO levels in south Asia. This increase was observed in the densely populated areas and attributed to the accompanying human induced activities. Industries and power facilities released large volumes of ozone precursors into the atmosphere in the IGP corridor (David et al., 2019 ).D) Regional Pollution Sources    Local biogenic sources and both short and long-range transport exerts influence on O3  concentration (Dhawan et al., 2023 ). Local sources include vehicles, manufacturing and electricity generation industries, construction activities, waste burning, combustion of oil, coal, and biomass in the homes. Vehicles are the leading anthropogenic source of NOx  and VOCs in Chinese and Indian cities. The two commonly utilized fuels, petrol and diesel release VOCs, CO, and NOx  in air. Between 1999 and 2013, the number of vehicles increased from 49 to 220 million in China. In 2020, the number of motor vehicles registered in India has almost doubled from 2010 (Road Transport Yearbook, 2020 ). At Beijing vehicular pollution contributes 57%, and 64.1% of precursor NMVOCs and NOx  emissions (Naveed et al., 2021 ). The expansion of the regional road network has led to increase on-road traffic in the PRD region, with traffic mileage growing by 75.4% in 2006 compared to 1996 (. Zhang et al., 2011 ). In 2006, mobile sources were responsible for 45% of NOx  emissions and 67.8% of VOC emissions in the PRD region. China and India collectively produced 941,531 MW of energy from coal-powered facilities (Naveed et al., 2021 ). Recent studies highlight a growing dependence on coal-fired power plants for energy production in the southeastern region of Asia, notably in India, China, and Pakistan. This form of energy generation is closely linked to the emergence of air pollutants like NOx , VOCs and Ozone. Industries and power facilities released large volumes of ozone precursors into the atmosphere in the IGP corridor (David et al., 2019 ). China and India rank prominently among the leading global producers of bricks. 45 % of the bricks in the world are manufactured in China ( Chen et al., 2017 ). In India, brick kilns constitute the world's second-largest brick manufacturing sector, utilizing approximately 35 million tons of coal annually (Naveed et al., 2021 ). Environmental pollution arises from the incomplete combustion of coal and the use of inferior quality fuels such as wood and rubber tires in the process of brick production (Sarath, 2020 ) leading to release of substantial amounts of NO2  and VOCs (Xie et al., 2021 ). Burning biomass produced a sizable amount of polluting gases into the surrounding environment throughout South and Southeast Asia (Yu et al., 2017 ). North China Plain (NCP) is the primary location for crop residue burning, whereas East Asia is the primary region where the increase in tropospheric ozone is noted. It is thought that increased levels of ozone precursors, like NOx  and VOCs, released by extensive agricultural residue burning in the NCP, may be the cause of the observed ozone increase in East Asia as photochemical process is frequently influenced more by the relative amounts of NOx  and VOCs than by other variables like temperature and UV radiation. As a result, the region's tropospheric ozone might significantly rise as a result of the increased NOx  content (Ma et al., 2018 ). In the peninsular India a comparatively lower abundance of significant point sources, such as vehicular emissions and biomass burning is observed. These regions of India exhibit a relatively higher temperature and humidity compared to IGP. This climatic disparity contributes to elevated concentrations of hydroxyl radicals, leading to increased photolysis of NO2  and decreased production of tropospheric ozone.E) Meteorology, Summer Monsoons and Seasonal Variation:    Strong solar radiation, abundance of water vapour, and significant photochemical reactions are characteristics of tropical Asia and meteorology plays an important role in modulating seasonal ozone concentrations (Shukla et al., 2017 ; Yan et al., 2023 ). Temperature and solar radiation have a strong positive link with O3  concentration ( ). Higher temperatures not only accelerate the rates of processes involving ozone precursors, such as soil NOx , biogenic VOCs, but are also frequently associated with longer sunshine hours, higher solar irradiation, and decreased relative humidity (Dewan and Lakhani, 2022 ). Studies have shown that ozone levels in India and China follow unique seasonal patterns (Beig et al., 2008 ; Schnell and Prather, 2017 ). The observed increase in tropospheric ozone levels over East Asia in June can be attributed to four main factors: UV radiation, meridional wind, zonal wind, and fire occurrence counts. In the IGP region the burning of crop residues in the pre- and post-monsoon seasons is the main cause of the high NO2  levels during this time period. The observed drop in NO2  in June to August months was also influenced by lower burning and lower emissions from human activities. During the transition from spring to autumn, the IGP region experienced a shift from NOx -limited conditions to a regime dominated by VOC limitations (Deka et al., 2022 ). In China, industrial and biogenic sources have a greater impact on summer ozone formation, while transportation and biogenic sources are significant contributors in India throughout the year. In India mid-tropospheric O3  showed the highest values in summer with lower values in monsoon. (David et al., 2019 ). HCHO concentration in the East Asian and South Asian region showed notable spatial and temporal fluctuations, shifting across several sub-regions. The main reason for these changes was that isoprene emissions are dependent on several factors like burning biomass, insolation, high temperatures, and biogenic emissions. With a magnitude of 0.14 DU, HCHO peaks were found in June, which coincided with a period of higher temperatures and solar radiation that increased isoprene emissions. Ozone concentrations in certain regions are influenced by the summer monsoon in both countries. The East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), has a significant influence on China's climate. With a correlation coefficient of 0.6, researchers have found a strong positive association between the summer surface ozone levels and the EASM index in the south-central region of China (Zhou et al., 2022 ). During ASM, higher NOx  emissions in 2014 compared to 1850 caused the upper tropospheric O3  to increase 1.5 times over India. Future NOx  emissions are also projected to increase, which will lead to an increase in the upper tropospheric O3  over India during the ASM ( Roy et al., 2023 ).F) Extreme Heat Events    Due to increased urbanisation and climate change, extreme heat events are occurring more frequently and with greater severity both globally and regionally. These events are often associated with elevated concentrations of ozone due to increased photochemical reactions and biogenic emissions of VOCs. Heatwaves characterised by atmospheric blockage, sinking air motion, and thin boundary layer height have exacerbated ozone pollution in portions of North China, such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Huang et al., 2023 ).  2.4 Uptake and mechanism of damage Ozone from the atmosphere is taken up by plants through stomatal and non-stomatal pathways, which include soil and cuticular deposition. Ozone uptake through stomata in the leaf surface is the dominant entry route, and 45% of ozone deposition on average across ecosystems occurs through stomata (Wedow et al., 2021 ). Diffusion of ozone occurs into the apoplast of the leaf from the air. Ozone is an abiotic stress that causes stomatal closure within 2 min of exposure, and later the stomata open again (Kollist et al., 2019 ). Studies reported that ozone in the range of 50–75 ppb decreased stomatal conductance, which restricts the flow of CO2  into the leaves. Depending on the ozone levels a rapid transient decrease can happen in a few minutes of ozone contact. This decrease in conductance was seen for up to numerous hours from the commencement of exposure to ozone. S-type slow anion channel 1 is necessary for stomatal closure and vital for restraining the entry of ozone into leaves. Guard cell outward rectifying K+  channel activation also regulates the stomatal closure in response to ozone and can cause membrane depolarization, resulting in ozone-induced programmed cell death (Ali and Baek, 2020 ; Mahadi Hasan et al., 2021 ). After the initial detection of ozone, signalling systems in leaves become desensitized, and in some plants, stomatal closure doesn't even occur (Kollist et al., 2019 ). Apoplastic ascorbate (AsA) in the apoplastic fluid was frequently thought of as the plant's first line of defence against O3 , but the extent of its role in O3  tolerance is still unclear (Bellini and De Tullio, 2019 ; Fatima et al., 2019 ). Ozone is a non-polar molecule that diffuses into the apoplastic fluid after penetrating plant leaves through the stomata and does not stay in the intercellular spaces for long (Fig. S2 ). It is highly reactive in this microenvironment and reacts quickly with water, ascorbate, thiols, phenolics, and transition metals to yield reactive oxygen species (ROS) and toxic compounds (Ainsworth, 2017 ; Marchica et al., 2019 ). ROS produced are involved in numerous biological processes, such as long-distance signalling, abiotic and biotic stress, and cell death (Bellini and De Tullio, 2019 ). Several classes of molecules serve as antioxidants like ascorbate (AsA), glutathione (GSH), and phenolic compounds such as flavanols and lipophilic antioxidant such as α-tocopherol or carotenoids. These act as ROS scavengers or support the regeneration of the reduced form of antioxidants. Certain enzymes like catalases, which are specifically found in peroxisomes, and other peroxidases are among the first group of enzymes that trap the superoxide ion and hydrogen peroxide (Dusart et al., 2019 ). The close redox coupling of AsA and GSH pools in vivo is thought to be responsible for the regeneration of these antioxidants. Apoplastic ascorbate and other antioxidants also scavenge ROS, but if the capacity for ROS detoxification in the apoplast is overwhelmed, then ROS signalling pathways are induced (Grulke and Heath, 2020 ). Ozone exposure leads to oxidative bursts which increase the production of ROS, including hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and nitric oxide, in the apoplast and the rise of Ca2+  levels in the guard cells (Ainsworth, 2017 ). Nitric oxide (NO) is a central signalling molecule made in plants when they are exposed to ozone. H2 O2  can interact with NO, and NO donors such as sodium nitroprusside can induce H2 O2  accumulation in plasma (Dusart et al., 2019 ). Plasma membrane aquaporins allow entry of H2 O2  in cells and together with oxidised ascorbate, alter the redox balance of the cell. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling cascades are thus activated, which initiate the transformed expression of genes involved in hormone biosynthesis, respiration, and photosynthesis. Protein oxidation, ozonolysis of membrane lipids, production of toxic intermediates, and stimulated production of ethylene and salicylic acid follow and cause enhanced senescence and negative effects on metabolic processes (. Emberson, Pleijel, Ainsworth, van den Berg, et al., 2018 ). A direct chemical reaction between ozone and ethylene, possibly resulting in the formation of free radicals and toxic aldehydes, may be associated with increase in ozone-induced leaf damage (Mahadi Hasan et al., 2021 ). Long-lasting exposure to ozone is identified to activate a significant increase of the respiratory process while decreasing photosynthesis (Gandin et al., 2021 ; Yue and Unger, 2014 ). Visible foliar injury symptoms may result from changes in plant metabolism due to ozone damage, although lowered net photosynthesis and biomass production may also occur without the appearance of visible injury.  2.5 Plant damage assessment metrics Two distinct techniques are employed to investigate the impact of ozone on crop yield. Using open top chambers (OTC) and free-air controlled exposure (FACE) systems, several investigations on the response of various crops to increased surface O3  concentration have been carried out in the recent years (Ainsworth, 2017 ; Fischer, 2019 ; Zhao et al., 2020 ). Whereas the crops in a FACE trial are exposed to high ozone levels in an open field, the crops in an OTC experiment are contained in a chamber with a controlled environment. In contrast to growth chambers or open top chambers, the FACE technology was initially created to study plant reactions to high CO2  and O3  in circumstances more similar to nature. FACE plots work by releasing or blowing air that has been enriched with O3  into the wind, which increases O3  throughout an experimental plot (Pui, 2023 ). Each O3 -FACE plot has a sensor in the centre that continuously measures O3  and transmits the data to a proportional-integral-derivative control system, which automatically modifies O3  output to maintain a desired setpoint (Montes et al., 2022 ). OTC environments resemble natural fields in some ways, although they are typically warmer, more humid, shadowed, and have different airflow patterns. Furthermore, research done in OTCs frequently exaggerates the impact of treatments on biomass production and yield (Singh and Agrawal, 2017 ). The upkeep of FACE experiments is expensive, technically difficult, and time-consuming (Ashrafuzzaman et al., 2017 ). Table 1   shows relation between RY and ozone metrics for different crops. Experiment-based modelling studies fall into three broad groups as shown in Fig. S3 . These are Exposure-Response Functions (ERF) for empirical relationships between yield and ozone exposure, flux-based approaches that account for ozone uptake rather than exposure, and process-based models that simulate the physiological effects of O3  on various plant processes.1) Exposure-based functions or studies using dose-response relationships are based only on the atmospheric concentration of ozone. These studies indicate that the areas with the highest concentrations of ozone are expected to experience the most significant impacts. They do not consider factors that influence the uptake of ozone by stomata. While these metrics are easy to calculate, they often overlook the active physiological reactions of plants to changing climatic and environmental conditions. They also fail to account for the cumulative effects of ozone in conjunction with other factors that influence plant uptake. Consequently, these metrics may not fully capture the yield losses that may occur in a changing future environment (Ren et al., 2020 ). Conversely, when applied to similar conditions they were trained on, ERFs can be easily computed over large geographical areas and provide reliable results (Chuwah et al., 2015 ). AOT40 (Accumulated Ozone exposure over a threshold of 40 ppb) serves as an example of an exposure-based index that is simpler to calculate as it only requires ozone concentrations. It works effectively in regions with relatively consistent weather conditions (Fig. S3 ).  2) Flux-based approaches quantify leaf ozone uptake, i.e., the dose that actually enters the plant tissues via stomata, and consider the environmental constraints (i.e., climate, phenology, or soil properties) that may limit optimal stomatal conductance during the season of plant growth (Emberson, Pleijel, Ainsworth, van den Berg, et al., 2018 ). This technique is especially relevant for regions with distinct climatic or water stress circumstances, but its computation requires hourly meteorological and soil water content data, which are usually unavailable (Rydsaa et al., 2016 ; Sicard et al., 2020 ). This approach specifically considers the regulation of ozone intake through stomatal control and its dependence on environmental factors, particularly in relation to soil water availability. In this method, there is typically no need for detailed mechanistic simulations of eco-physiological processes such as photosynthesis, carbon allocation, and crop responses. Instead, stomatal conductance is represented using a semi-empirical function, where a baseline stomatal conductance under standard conditions is multiplied by various “activity factors” that adjust for variations in environmental conditions (Agathokleous et al., 2018 ).    The computed instantaneous O3  flux is typically added up during the growing season to estimate a Phytotoxic O3  Dose (PODY  with an hourly threshold of uptake Y nmol O3  m−2  s−1  per leaf area). Flux-based models employ a variety of cut-off thresholds (Y) corresponding to different levels of detoxification (Dusart et al., 2019 ). Y stands for a detoxification threshold below which any ozone molecule adsorbed by the leaf is presumed to be detoxified (Lefohn et al., 2018 ). Statistical relationships between PODY  and crop yield have been established through extensive experimentation and are utilized to assess the impact of ozone on crop yields (Wang et al., 2022a ). When combined with ozone fields simulated by regional atmospheric chemistry models, these flux-based measures have demonstrated superior statistical performance compared to concentration-based metrics (Pleijel et al., 2022 ). They also provide better predictions of the extent of ozone damage. These measures explicitly consider the influence of stomatal control on ozone uptake, which can significantly affect crop damage even at the same ambient ozone concentrations. This factor contributes to their enhanced effectiveness. Due to these reasons, PODY  is being considered as a new legislative standard in Europe (Anav et al., 2022 ; Sicard et al., 2016 ). As more data and evidence have become accessible, a refined approach called PODY IAM (PODY  for Integrated Assessment Modelling) has been developed. This approach categorizes calculations based on vegetation type and is well-suited for regional-scale and integrated assessment models (Wang et al., 2022b ). PODY SPEC is a species or group of species-specific PODY  that requires comprehensive input data and is suitable for detailed risk assessment (Convention, 2017 ). 3) Process-based models simulate how O3  affects several plant processes physiologically. Process-based models can be utilized to quantify the impacts of ozone flux (instantaneous or cumulative) on photosynthetic rate or stomatal conductance, subsequently influencing crop productivity through changes in carbon assimilation and other agricultural biogeochemical processes (Cailleret et al., 2018 ). Examples of land surface and terrestrial ecosystem models used in conjunction with this approach include the Community Land Model (CLM), Joint-UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) (Leung et al., 2022 ), and MOSES-TRIFFID (Tai et al., 2021 ). Unlike metric-based approaches, mechanistic crop models can more accurately simulate diverse agricultural practices (such as irrigation) and encompass crop physiology alongside photosynthesis, accounting for varying environmental conditions and long-term climate and atmospheric composition changes. However, due to limited data on ozone flux for crops, it remains challenging to apply these process-based models at large or global scales, as key model elements require thorough parameterisation. Comparing the three methods mentioned above for predicting ozone impacts on crops is challenging due to their dissimilar input requirements and historical application within specific modelling backgrounds. Additionally, the development of multiple metrics has been influenced by inconsistent study designs and variations in environmental controls, even when considering the same crop. These factors have contributed to existing uncertainties surrounding the evaluation of ozone impacts on crops. Numerous ozone indices are employed to evaluate the threshold effects, which include AOTX (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60), where X is the threshold in ppb, SUM06, W126, M7 or M12, POD0 or POD10. AOT40 is stipulated in the European-Directive of 2008 on Ambient Air Quality and PODY  is proposed by the Working Group on Effects of UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (Colette et al., 2018 ). Some exposure metrics focus on the relatively higher ozone values, while other metrics focus on a combination of the various parts of the distribution.• M12 is the 12-h mean at ozone monitor inlet height, averaged over the period 08:00–19:59 h (local time) for 3 months (wheat, rice) or 6 months (perennial vegetation), unit: ppb.  • M7 is the mean 7-h O3  mixing ratio from 09:00 to 15:59 (local time) for 3 months (wheat, rice) or 6 months (perennial vegetation); unit: ppb  • AOT40 is the sum of the difference between the hourly mean ozone value and 40 ppb for all daylight hours over a specified time period (3 months for wheat and rice, 6 months for perennial vegetation), unit: ppb h.  • W126 is the sigmoidal-weighted sum of all hourly ozone values observed during a specified daily and seasonal time window, where each hourly ozone value is given a weight that increases from zero to one with increasing values (units: ppb-hrs)  • SUM06 is the sum of hourly O3  mixing ratios that go above the permissible limit of 60 ppb all around the growing season and sunlight hours.  • POD6  is Phytotoxic Ozone Dose over an hourly threshold 6 nmol m2  s −1     Mills et al. observed strong correlations between three different concentration-based metrics namely AOT40, W126 and M12 with r2  values in polynomial function varying from 0.84 to 0.96 (Mills et al., 2018b ). Fig. 3   shows regional mean O3  metric values from 2010 to 2014 for North America (NAM), Europe (EU), South East Asia (EA), and South Asia (SAS) for wheat and rice for three months. Ozone trends differ depending on the metric being considered. AOT40 and W126 are cumulative metrics whereas M7 and M12 are mean metrics. The spatial patterns for AOT40 and M7 exhibit relatively comparable distributions (Cao et al., 2020 ). In the context of global aggregate losses, AOT40 commonly results in the most significant yield reductions across various regions and crops as shown in Fig. 4  A and B. Studies show that estimates of relative yield losses for wheat and rice are generally larger when estimated from AOT40 than from M7 (Cao et al., 2020 ). But for maize and soybean losses estimates are larger using M12 than AOT40 due to differences in the dose-response functions (Tai et al., 2021 ). A closer analysis across metrics reveals that the exceedingly high yield losses for soybean and wheat are predominantly driven by a single metric (M7or M12 for soybean, AOT40 for wheat). M7 and M12 work well when there is little variation in O3  concentration profile throughout the growing season and other environmental stressors are absent. If variations in ozone concentrations as well as ozone pollution episodes are large then use of AOT40 and W126 is better. The trend in PODY  is more influenced by the trend in annual mean ozone, whereas the trend in AOT40 is relatively more influenced by the trend in peaks. For AOT40, only concentrations above 40 ppb are accumulated to calculate the risk of crop yield losses due to ozone. For POD6 SPEC, concentrations as low as 20 ppb may be included in the calculation of the risk (Lefohn et al., 2018 ). Pliejel et al. noted that a certain level of POD6  can be related with a somewhat wide range of AOT40 values and did not observe a very strong relationship between the two metrics (Pleijel et al., 2022 ). Studies on wheat and maize indicated that yield losses calculated using PODy  tend to be lower than those determined using AOT40 (Mills et al., 2018a ; Wang et al., 2022a ). Though some studies demonstrated Relative Yield Losses (RYL) calculated using PODy  tend to be higher than those determined using AOT40 ((Tang et al., 2013 ; Tsai et al., 2022 ). According to Collete et al. between 1990 and 2010, crop exposure decreased across Europe as measured by the AOT40 metric, but a far more limited fall was shown by the POD6 SPEC (Colette et al., 2018 ). The reason for this discrepancy may be the different susceptibilities of the two metrics to trends in the background and peaks of ozone, or the impact of other environmental factors (like soil moisture, temperature, or water vapour) that affect the length of the growing season and stomatal uptake that are factored in when determining the dosage of POD6 SPEC. Wang et al. estimated the relative yield loss of winter wheat from POD3 IAM and M7 to be 19% and 6% respectively which was slightly lower than from AOT40 (20–28%). Relative yield losses are greater for POD3 IAM because high temperature and relative humidity increase stomatal conductance and promote ozone uptake but in the dry climate stomatal uptake of ozone is lower, and relative yield losses are smaller ( Wang et al., 2022b ). Ozone levels tend to have a higher stomatal flux in irrigated crops, which can be categorized into ozone-sensitive crops like wheat and soybean, as well as moderately sensitive crops such as rice and maize ( Wang et al., 2022a ). Variations in ozone pollution can lead to significant differences in how various crops within a single region respond to it, as well as how a single crop reacts when grown in different regions (Feng et al., 2012 ). Additionally, the accuracy of calculating PODY  is influenced by the inherent uncertainty associated with models that rely on meteorological and soil parameters as inputs, which, in turn, impacts the precision of PODY  calculations (Peng et al., 2019 ). Besides concerns regarding the type of metric that should be used to assess the effects of ozone on crops, there are apprehensions about how such effects may change in the future due to the absence of clear trends in flux based metrics (Colette et al., 2018 ). Some researchers suggest that the flux metrics are superior to exposure metrics (Pleijel et al., 2022 ). For these reasons, the use of flux-based metrics is now encouraged since they capture concentrations that are likely to cause damage to vegetation and consider both chronic and acute O3  concentrations that contribute equally to O3  damage. But in situations where environmental factors like soil moisture, which can significantly influence stomatal conductance, vary greatly due to differing water availability conditions, it has been noted that flux-based metrics tend to outperform exposure-based metrics. So, drought is a key factor in deciding the type of metric to use. In various research studies conducted in conditions where water availability was not a limiting factor, similar levels of performance were noted between exposure-based and flux-based metrics. In specific cases involving certain crops, AOT40 might be suitable for conducting risk assessments in regions with consistent climatic conditions due to its simplicity and user-friendliness (Tai et al., 2021 ). However, when dealing with areas characterized by significant variations in ozone levels and environmental factors, POD6  is recommended as it better captures the true impact of O3  exposure on vegetation (Peng et al., 2019 ). Comprehensive research on parameters specific to each species to assess the impact of O3  on crops in Asia is required. Moreover, it's important to note that the choice of thresholds employed in AOT and POD calculations can significantly affect the extent of relative yield reductions (Tsai et al., 2022 ). Notably, for a specific crop, differences in yield losses among these metrics within the same region often surpass differences between regions. This indicates that methodological disparities contribute the most uncertainty to ozone-induced yield reductions, sometimes overshadowing discrepancies in input data.E Ozone effects on crop yield and associated economic losses     This section offers an overview of studies summarising losses due to ozone pollution for four major crops maize, wheat, rice, and soybean that are essential to world agriculture. Rice, wheat, maize and Soybean, are the most significant food crops in the world, which, according to estimates from 2013, account for 18.3, 18.9, 5.4, and 3.3% of the total calories consumed by humans (Savary et al., 2019 ). Fig. 5   shows RYL in different regions of the world in the backdrop of FAO's hunger map. The map shows percentage of total population facing undernourishment for three years from 2020 to 2022 which is an SDG2 indicator. The worst affected countries are in Africa and South Asia. If crops are lost due to ozone pollution, it can worsen the state of food security in these poor nations that are already experiencing hunger. Studies on risk assessment are based on response functions that link response variables like yield to exposure-based and flux-based metrics. Because there are regional variations in O3  sensitivity across cultivars, using response functions generated from local studies is always preferred in regional risk assessment (Hong et al., 2020 ). The uncertainties linked with model simulations, like those resulting from model depiction, boundary conditions, etc., can be lowered by the use of observational data. This significantly improves the accuracy of the O3  metrics calculated in comparison to modelled data. The AOT40 accumulation time in each location can be more accurately adjusted by employing field observations of the important phenological moments, which also increases the dependability of the estimates. These methods have been extensively employed to evaluate global crop yield reductions caused by current levels of ozone concentrations. To estimate the spatial variations in the sensitivities of wheat, maize, and soybean yields to ozone exposures and temperature extremes in the US and Europe, Tai & Martin developed an empirical model known as the Partial Derivative-Linear Regression (PDLR) model (Tai and Val Martin, 2017 ). The mean modelled percentage yield losses ranged from 3.3 to 5.3%, 4.5–7.6%, 5.3–10.0% and 7.4–15.3% for rice, maize, wheat and soybean respectively. For rice, maize and wheat, the highest annual production losses were reported for South & Eastern Asia (Harmens et al., 2020 ) . McGrath's regression analysis of historical yield, climate, and ozone data for the United States revealed that maize and soybean production decreased by 5 and 10%, respectively, costing about $9 billion annually (McGrath et al., 2015 ). If air pollutant emissions remain high, it has been observed that higher ozone concentrations could lead to a local increase in crop damage of up to 20% by 2050. However, applying air pollution control strategies could help curtail crop yield losses to 10% by the same year (Chuwah et al., 2015 ). Table 2   provides the location, study period, method, ozone concentration, data source, relative yield loss, and associated economic losses resulting from damage due to ozone pollution for four major primary crops in recent global studies. In a study conducted by Wang et al. winter wheat yield losses were assessed at the county level for the province of Henan in China ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Hourly ozone concentrations simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) and the AOT40 index were utilized. The results revealed that during the winter wheat growing seasons from 2015 to 2018, almost all counties in the province experienced a clear upward trend in both ozone concentration and AOT40 levels ( Wang et al., 2021 ). Ren et al. analysed the hourly ground-level O3  observation data of 158 stations from 2014 to 2019 in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and grain production data of 193 districts and counties. The exposure-response relationships based on AOT40 were used to estimate the yield loss and economic loss of two food crops (winter wheat and rice). During 2014–2017, the average estimated economic loss was about 1773 million USD for both crops (Ren et al., 2020 ). According to harvested area, maize is the world's second-most significant crop. NCP is a densely populated, important agricultural region that also has some of the highest ozone concentrations in the world. From 2014 to 2017, Feng et al. estimated county-level production and economic losses brought on by ozone in the NCP for these years using observational data along with geostatistical techniques. AOT40 values during the maize growing season progressively increased in the four consecutive years from 2014 to 2017 leading to a maize yield loss of 8.2–13.4% (Feng et al., 2020 ). Zhao et al. using data from the O3  monitoring network and AOT40-yield response functions, assessed the possible adverse effects of surface ozone on three major food crops (winter wheat, maize, and rice) throughout China between 2015 and 2018, leading to a loss of billions of US dollars (Zhao et al., 2020 ). Using the AOT40 metric, a comprehensive assessment was conducted to determine the spatial distribution of primary crop yield reductions caused by ambient ozone throughout China in the year 2014. O3  caused output losses in all crops of 78.4 million metric tonnes (Lin et al., 2018 ). Crop Yield Loss (CYL) brought on by surface ozone has a significant impact on the Indian economy and the availability of food for a billion people. Sharma et al. using the WRF-Chem model demonstrated RYL for wheat to be 26% and for rice to be 6% (Sharma et al., 2019 ). Lal et al. studied a collection of 17 sites encompassing various regions of India to assess the losses in wheat and rice crop yields. Their estimates placed the biggest annual loss of rice (approximately 2.6 million tonnes) and wheat (nearly 9 million tonnes) respectively, in northern India, one of the most polluted parts of the country. The anticipated yearly losses for rice and wheat in India were computed to be 0.3–6.7 million tonnes and 4.0–14.2 million tonnes, respectively (Lal et al., 2017 ). Wheat suffers the greatest losses followed by rice, and the losses are primarily in central and northern India (Ghude et al., 2014 ). Kumari et al. quantified wheat and rice crop O3 -induced yield losses in Agra, India. Due to elevated O3  levels during the Rabi season, crop production losses for wheat were 0.01–0.08 million tonnes and for rice were 29–1681 tonnes (Kumari et al., 2020 ).   3 3 Challenges, mitigation options and policy implications The significant increase in the populations of India and China presents a major obstacle in tackling the issue of ozone pollution. As resources dwindle and rapid economic expansion contributes to the depletion of the environment through extensive utilization, the problem is compounded. The swift progression of urban areas exacerbates these difficulties. Effectively controlling population growth in developing countries is essential for minimizing the impact of ozone pollution. Studies highlight controlling ozone precursor emissions of NOx  and NMVOCs for effective reduction of regional surface-level ozone (Sampedro et al., 2020 ). Reducing CH4  emissions decreases global radiative forcing better. Thus, surface O3  can be managed by first determining if VOCs or NOx  are the limiting variables in specific places and then reducing HCHO and nitrogen dioxide emissions. Ozone generation during China's summer is predominantly affected by industrial and natural sources, with minimal impact from other sectors. Conversely, transportation and natural sources play a more substantial role in India across all seasons. Moreover, in India, sources in the northern region hold greater importance compared to those in the southern region. These findings emphasize the seasonal shifts in the importance of source sectors and geographic areas, which have implications for managing O3  effectively. Diverse paths of NOx  emissions have been observed worldwide over the last three decades. North America saw a significant decrease of 56% in human-made NOx  emissions, while East Asia witnessed a substantial increase of 65% during the same period. Additionally, South Asia experienced an even more notable rise of 161%. Notably, there is a growing trend of NMVOCs from Southeast Asia, East Asia, Africa, and South Asia, with increases of 16, 8, 6, and 5%, respectively (Akimoto et al., 2015 ). Developing nations can draw lessons from the successful implementation of precursor reduction policies in North America and Europe. These lessons include the need for the establishment and enforcement of stringent emission standards for industries, vehicles, refineries, and combustion sources. Effective monitoring and enforcement play a crucial role. Monitoring emissions and rigorously implementing regulations are essential steps towards achieving compliance and reducing emissions. Policies promoting advancements in pollution control technology, the production of cleaner and more efficient engines, catalytic converters, and pollution control systems are also imperative. Enhancing risk assessment for national, regional, and global food supply under future ozone impact requires dependable crop growth models that account for ozone effects. While regional-scale modelling investigations offer valuable perspectives on the spatial and temporal fluctuations in ozone levels, their reliability is limited by the dynamic shifts in Asian emissions, the lack of consistency in experimental approaches, restricted range of crops and cultivars analysed, as well as a limited number of locations where these studies have been carried out (Emberson, 2020 ). Ozone research in Asia has typically been employing cost-effective methodologies constrained by financial limitations. Acquiring comprehensive datasets, especially from recent global experiments, poses a challenge, revealing gaps in current knowledge such as limited crop variety coverage and inconsistent experimental methods (Montes et al., 2022 ). Fig. 6   shows strategic policy recommendations to reduce ozone impact on crops. Some of the suggestions for mitigating the effects of ground-level ozone are. 3.1 Enforcing strict regulation of O3  precursor emissions We must enact rigorous legislation to minimise the emissions of O3  precursors, mainly NOx  and VOCs, mostly from motor vehicle exhaust, to effectively lower the concentration of ground-level O3  (Feng et al., 2015 ). But considering past ozone control policies, it has been observed that combined regulatory efforts to reduce anthropogenic NOx  and VOC emissions have not always led to adequate ozone concentration reductions. The non-linear link between the generation of ozone and its precursors, in which lowering one precursor may not always result in a reduction in ozone, is one of the issues (Zhang et al., 2019 ). Even in urban areas, the ideal NOx  to VOC ratio associated with minimum ozone generation varies from upwind to downwind and from day to day (or even hour to hour). VOCs can come from a variety of sources that are difficult to define. It can be challenging to regulate some known sources, such as household usage of consumer chemicals and biogenic emissions. Increase in CH4  concentrations may worsen crop damages (Emberson, 2020 ). Understanding the chemistry of CH4  and ozone precursors is essential to creating effective mitigation plans to minimise rise in ozone concentrations at a global level. Considering the previous increases in hemisphere ozone levels that have been linked to rising CH4  emissions, air pollution control policies that target ground-level ozone would need to include CH4  and CO reduction in their portfolio (Amann et al., 2020 ).  3.2 Creating crop genotypes with O3  tolerance The ability of plants to withstand O3  harm varies substantially between species and cultivars. A good way to lessen yield loss would be by introducing the O3 -resistant genes, contemporary molecular biology methods can be used to produce O3 -resistant genotypes (Zohdirad et al., 2022 ). In rice and soybean, certain genes that confer O3 -resistance have been identified (Ainsworth, 2017 ; Mills et al., 2018a ). These genes can be introduced into other crops through genetic engineering techniques. More promising seem to be molecular strategies like marker-assisted selection (MAS). Smaller-scale controlled ozone fumigation experiments can assess phenotypic variation in traits related to ozone tolerance and link it to genetic markers using mapping techniques, such as biparental quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and genome wide association study (Mills et al., 2018a, 2018c ). This would allow for the creation of new O3 -resistant cultivars that could be grown in areas with high levels of ozone pollution (Frei, 2015 ). In addition to genetic engineering, other strategies could also be employed to reduce yield loss from O3  exposure. For example, the use of ozone-resistant plant growth regulators or the development of more efficient irrigation systems could help to mitigate the negative effects of O3  on crop yields (Mukherjee et al., 2021 ). Ultimately, a combination of these approaches may be necessary to ensure food security in regions affected by ozone pollution.  3.3 Using chemical protective agents at crucial phenological stages By using antioxidants like ascorbic acid, glutathione, and the antiozonant ethylenediurea (EDU), plant damage brought on by high O3  concentrations could be reduced or even avoided (Feng et al., 2015 ; Gupta et al., 2023 ; Singh and Agrawal, 2017 ). Chemical protection against O3  is provided by EDU [N-(2-2-oxo-1-imidazolidinyl) ethyl]-N-phenyl urea. Particularly in remote rural areas of developing countries with inadequate electricity availability and finance, the application of EDU as a control to ambient O3  is important to determine ambient O3  effects in field grown plants. It has been widely employed as a research tool for O3  injury, cultivar screening, and the evaluation of yield losses brought on by O3  (Ashrafuzzaman et al., 2017 ). Pandey et al. observed EDU's O3  scavenging activity is mediated through an antioxidant defence mechanism as opposed to having a direct impact on physiological variables like photosynthesis and stomatal conductance (Pandey et al., 2015 ). The USA and several European nations have made considerable use of these antioxidants and EDU to prevent crop production loss due to ambient ozone (Bellini and De Tullio, 2019 ). Although it is known that phytotoxicity can happen at high concentrations, the toxicity of EDU in the food chain has not been studied. Since these crops are grown in areas where high ozone concentrations frequently occur during the growing season, the most effective strategy for using these chemical protective agents could be applied at key phenological stages, such as grain filling in both wheat and soybean, and tillering in rice. Field tests to determine the most effective application of these chemicals on crops have not yet been evaluated.  3.4 Adjusting agricultural planting schedules to evade ozone peaks The synchronization of crop growth cycles with seasonal spikes in ozone production leads to yield reductions in irrigated crops, which are often comparable to or greater than the losses seen in rain-fed crops, especially in India. Shifting the commencement of the planting season by two weeks earlier substantially decreases the loss of winter wheat production, typically falling within the range of 26–30%. Conversely, postponing the start of the growing season by two weeks results in a significant rise in production losses, ranging from approximately 23 to 45%. This highlights the crucial significance of precise timing in determining the growing season, as adjusting crop calendars can potentially alleviate local ozone depletion for specific crop and location combinations (. Emberson, Pleijel, Ainsworth, van den Berg, et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2022b ).  3.5 Establishing vegetation-based standards for ozone in India and China The stomatal uptake of tropospheric ozone represents a major danger to forest and crop ecosystems. AOT40 is a concentration-based metric used at the international scale and adopted by European Union and Convention on Long Range and Transboundary pollution (Convention, 2017 ) for protection of vegetation and crops. Its critical level is set at 3000 ppb h for agricultural crops (Mills et al., 2018a ). In US W126 is a metric for protection of trees, plants and ecosystems. In developing countries like India and China standards are needed for protecting vegetation from dangerous effects of ozone (Sinha et al., 2015 ). These countries presently account for high crop damages due to ozone, prevalence moderate to severe food insecurity but have no vegetation based critical levels and standards to protect crops from ozone. The development of these standards will require scientifically supported strategies, sound knowledge of how vegetation responds to ozone, how these metrics are spread in different climatic zones in these countries and how they vary over time. To comprehend the effects at various locations, particular parameterizations of the ozone stomatal flux are also needed Efforts should be directed in this direction by scientific community and government of these countries.  3.6 Developing robust crop models that account for ozone effect Effect of ozone on plants should be included in crop models. Research should focus on models that couple soil, plant and atmospheric processes to simulate eco-physiological response of plants to ozone flux (Conte et al., 2021 ). Critical ozone thresholds need to be defined and proper dose-response relation must be included in these models. The species-specific ozone dose-response functions observed from experimental data can be used to validate the models.   4 Conclusion Crop production is essential for maintaining global food security and from 2010 to 2050, there will be a 35–56% rise in the overall demand for food worldwide (van Dijk et al., 2021 ). Besides other factors ozone pollution, can have a major impact on agricultural yields and overview of the global crop losses attributable to ozone pollution and its effects on agricultural production are intended to be provided in this paper. The adverse effects of rising tropospheric ozone are spatially variable across the globe. Compared to concentration-based measurements, flux-based metrics more precisely reflect the fundamental physical and physiological processes that govern ozone damage to vegetation because they explicitly take into account ozone deposition and absorption by stomata. If future crop, Earth system, and Integrated Assessment Models are to offer valuable maps of regions of high vulnerability for vegetative productivity and food security, they must adopt this methodology. Flux-based metrics, however, are difficult to compute because estimating stomatal conductance necessitates a lot of species and even cultivar specific characteristics. To better understand how sensitive various crops and cultivars are to ozone exposure, more open top chamber and Free Air Chemical Enrichment (FACE) experiments are therefore desperately needed, as well as data from extensive field experiments. With the use of this data, crucial threshold values and suitable dose-response relationships for the crop and study area will be established. It also emphasizes the necessity for conducting additional experiments and trials that are specific to particular crops and regions to formulate accurate dose-response functions. There are a number of uncertainties in the worldwide estimates of crop loss due to O3 . These uncertainties may result from each step in the modelling process or the way in which the growing season is defined. Ambiguities may pertain to the robustness of ozone metrics, the prediction of surface ozone in models, and potential errors in dose-response estimates due to genotypic sensitivity among crop species. Certain abiotic factors like drought, temperature, and nitrogen accessibility also control ozone response in crops. Even with these variations, the studies provide sturdy evidence that the detrimental effects of ozone on agricultural production are quite large and are, in fact, at least as high as the projected costs of climate change to agriculture. The coordination of research on ozone impacts on international level such as Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) and the Agricultural Modelling and Improvement Intercomparison Project (AgMIP) can unite crop growth modelers to assess the accuracy of different crop models in replicating the effects of ozone and other pressures. Implementing such international agreements could facilitate coordinated efforts, direction, and analysis of integrated research studies, thereby offering options for mitigating and adapting to ozone pollution and climate change. One potential solution to reducing ozone pollution is the implementation of stricter regulations on industrial emissions. This would require cooperation from governments and industries. Finally, educating the public about the dangers of ozone pollution and its impact on food security can help increase awareness and encourage individuals to take action in reducing their own carbon footprint. By implementing these strategies, we can work towards a future where food security is no longer threatened by ozone pollution. Increased tropospheric ozone is probably going to be one of the main factors determining how our planet's vegetation develops in the future. The improvement of crop tolerance and prevention of productivity losses may result from the identification of the mechanisms underlying ozone tolerance (Ainsworth, 2017 ). Future plant breeding programmes for increasing productivity must place a high priority on natural antioxidants. Modern molecular biotechnology offers a valuable tool for identifying stress resistance genes. By using advanced screening techniques, researchers can identify genes that confer resistance to environmental stressors such as ozone. Additionally, the use of antioxidants like ascorbic acid or ethylenediurea could prove effective in reducing O3  damage, particularly in areas with high levels of O3  exposure. Studies have shown that these antioxidants can significantly mitigate the effects of O3  exposure, making them promising candidates for further investigation. Ultimately, the application of modern molecular biotechnology and the use of antioxidants could lead to new strategies for mitigating the harmful effects of environmental stressors on plants and other organisms.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ Ozone pollution is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention at both regional and global levels. By addressing this problem, we can help prevent future crop yield losses, which will ultimately contribute to reducing food scarcity around the world. The benefits of tackling ozone pollution extend beyond just improving crop yields; it can also help us achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. By working together to address this issue, we can make significant progress towards ending hunger and promoting sustainable agriculture. It is essential that we take action now to ensure a brighter future for generations to come. The ability and willingness of humanity to improve resource efficiency in production and consumption as well as to separate economic growth from environmental harm will be crucial to achieving sustainability. High-income and upper-middle-income nations must assume responsibility and set an example in these areas.
