                  Most cities of low- and middle-income countries in Asia, in which more than 80% of the urban population is facing wastewater collection and treatment problems, generally employ conventional centralized systems to treat wastewater from bathrooms and kitchens. Despite the Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 (SDG6) targets which aim to improve unsafely managed sanitation conditions by 2030, about 2.8 billion people are still employing unsafe sanitation facilities which usually cause environmental impacts and faecal pathogen infections. Because of this problem, the challenge in identifying convenient solutions on safe domestic wastewater management is needed to accomplish the SDG6 targets. This research evaluates the existing domestic wastewater management of some cities in Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam), and proposes some convenient solutions based on four important indicators. These indicators included collection and treatment performance for domestic wastewater management, cost-benefit ratio, and social content. Based on actual domestic management data compiled from the 55 cities in three Southeast Asian countries, influencing factors affecting effectiveness of domestic wastewater management of these cities were classified using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) techniques. Domestic wastewater management effectiveness chart was generated and tested with the five tested cities in three Southeast Asian countries having similar domestic wastewater management conditions during the period January–June 2021. The convenient solutions on safely domestic wastewater management were proposed such as contributing the capacity of wastewater collection to be 20,000 m3 per day per 5,000 households, and introducing the wastewater collection fees covering the full cost of operations and maintenance to accomplish the SDG6 targets on safe domestic wastewater management.

Most cities of low- and middle-income countries in Asia, in which more than 80% of the urban population is facing wastewater collection and treatment problems, generally employ conventional centralized systems to treat wastewater from bathrooms and kitchens. Despite the Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 (SDG6) targets which aim to improve unsafely managed sanitation conditions by 2030, about 2.8 billion people are still employing unsafe sanitation facilities which usually cause environmental impacts and faecal pathogen infections. Because of this problem, the challenge in identifying convenient solutions on safe domestic wastewater management is needed to accomplish the SDG6 targets. This research evaluates the existing domestic wastewater management of some cities in Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam), and proposes some convenient solutions based on four important indicators. These indicators included collection and treatment performance for domestic wastewater management, cost-benefit ratio, and social content. Based on actual domestic management data compiled from the 55 cities in three Southeast Asian countries, influencing factors affecting effectiveness of domestic wastewater management of these cities were classified using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) techniques. Domestic wastewater management effectiveness chart was generated and tested with the five tested cities in three Southeast Asian countries having similar domestic wastewater management conditions during the period January–June 2021. The convenient solutions on safely domestic wastewater management were proposed such as contributing the capacity of wastewater collection to be 20,000 m3  per day per 5,000 households, and introducing the wastewater collection fees covering the full cost of operations and maintenance to accomplish the SDG6 targets on safe domestic wastewater management.

WHO/UNICEF (2021)  presented the progress on water, sanitation, and hygiene towards the SDG6 targets in many countries in which less than 20% of sewer wastewater treatment in urbanized areas in Southeast Asian countries was treated as a safely managed service. Arphacharus (2016)  and Koottatep et al. (2021)  mentioned that approximately 10 million m3  per day of wastewater generated by the population in Thailand was discharged to the nearby environment in which only 23% of total urban wastewater is treated by conventional centralized treatment systems. These problems were addressed by decentralized treatment systems which are not effective in treating wastewater and the partially treated effluents normally overflow to storm drains or nearby environment, resulting in environmental and faecal pathogen infections (Ferrer et al., 2012 ; Joob and Wiwanitkit, 2015 ; León et al., 2018 ). These findings were confirmed by Department of Disease Control (2020)  who stated that the effects of unsafely managed sanitation are related to prevalence of liver fluke infections and diarrhea morbidity, especially in the water shortage regions. Similar to other countries, for example Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, only 10% of the urban populations were employed by public sewerage system, while the rest employs mainly non-sewered sanitations whose effluents are directly discharged to open drains or nearby water courses (Sabeen et al., 2018 ; UNESCAP, 2019 ). Several studies have documented inequalities in sanitation facilities and services in different countries worldwide which hamper the accomplishment of SDG6 targets. Some studies have mentioned barriers of domestic wastewater management such as financial viability, manpower requirements, technology and policy supports, but ignoring safe sanitation to accomplish SDG6 (Sabogal et al., 2014 ; Malik et al., 2015 ; Von, 2016 ). These barriers were confirmed by ADB (2017)  and UN-HABITAT (2021)  who mentioned that the access to safe sanitation facilities from containment to treatment should be considered to accomplish SDG6 targets. A similar finding was confirmed by Edokpayi (2016)  who suggested type of technologies for domestic wastewater management as one solution is not enough to address the domestic wastewater management problems to accomplish SDG6 targets on safe sanitation management. In this respect, the effectiveness criteria in relation to safe domestic wastewater management need to be established in this research. Moreover, with the demand for safely managed domestic wastewater, understanding factors affecting the performance of domestic wastewater management to accomplish SDG6 targets are increasingly important. Understanding these factors are crucial in determining convenient solutions on safely domestic wastewater management to accomplish SDG6, which could help protect public health and minimizing environmental pollution. Several authors have assessed the performance of domestic wastewater treatment facilities in different countries worldwide to evaluate the achievement of the SDG6 targets (Buonocore et al., 2018 ; Gorgoglione and Torretta, 2018 ; Weststrate et al., 2019 ; García-López et al., 2021 ). A large number of literatures point to the importance of type of technologies for domestic wastewater management, but there are no established criteria to achieve the SDG6 targets on safely managed domestic wastewater. Based on literature reviews (Japan International Cooperation Agency, 2017 ; Edmondson et al., 2018 ; Casiano et al., 2019 ; Prochaska and Zouboulis, 2020 ) and key informant interviews relating to the performance of sanitation management areas (such as waterworks authority and utilities providers in the region), four important wastewater management indicators with its influencing factors were determined for assessing the achievement of the SDG6 targets as presented in Table 1  . The aims of this research were: (i) to investigate the existing domestic wastewater management of the five test cities in Southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand) in relation to SDG6 for safely managed sanitation, (ii) to develop domestic wastewater management indicators and their respective influencing factors for domestic wastewater management, and (iii) to propose some effective options to achieve SDG6 targets for safely managed domestic wastewater and health risk protection.  2 Research methodology The research compiled data of domestic wastewater management of 55 cities in Thailand and tested with some cities in three Southeast Asian countries (Buon Ma thuota, Vietnam; Yogyakarta, Indonesia, Hadyai, Patong and Tharae, Thailand) having similar domestic wastewater management conditions and numbers of households ranging from 5,000 to 120,000 during the period January–June 2021 as shown in Fig. 1  . In addition, these three countries have different levels of development systems, which can affect their approach to domestic wastewater management and provide insights into sustainable development for domestic wastewater management. For example, Vietnam has made significant progress in improving access to sanitation facilities and implementing wastewater treatment systems in urban areas. Indonesia has adopted a decentralized approach to wastewater management, with local governments taking the lead in planning and implementing wastewater projects. Thailand has implemented various policies and initiatives to promote sustainable wastewater management (World Bank, 2013 ; ADB, 2015 ; WHO, 2020 ; Koottatep et al., 2021 ). In this respect, information on existing domestic wastewater management was obtained by questionnaire surveys, online meetings with key informants (such as wastewater management operators, waterworks authority, and utilities providers), telephone interviews (with local leaders and concerned households) and from a literature survey relevant to domestic wastewater management practices in the region. The following data were collected: (i) domestic wastewater collection performance (such as: number of households using on-site sanitation systems per city, number of households connected to conventional centralized wastewater treatment plant per city and capacity of wastewater treatment facilities), (ii) domestic wastewater treatment practices (such as: number of operators per wastewater treatment plant, type of domestic wastewater treatment technology, and direct wastewater discharges into open drains), (iii) cost-benefit ratio (such as: domestic wastewater collection fees and operation and maintenance costs of domestic wastewater treatment facilities), and (iv) social content (such as number of environmental pollution and health complaints and number of households satisfied with domestic wastewater facilities and management). The collected data were analyzed using RSM techniques to simulate the optimum conditions and improve their performance to accomplish the SDG6 targets for each city. Applying RSM to domestic wastewater management involves defining the response variable, designing experiments, building a statistical model, optimizing the process, and validating the model as following below:Step 1: Define the response variable: The first step in applying RSM is to define the response variable such as collection efficiency, treatment efficiency, and social content.  Step 2: Data entry and analysis: Once the responses have been collected, the data should be entered into a spreadsheet or database for analysis.  Step 3: Build the RSM model: Once the data has been analyzed, a statistical model can be built using RSM to describe the relationship between the input variables (such as wastewater treatment performance) and the response variable (such as number of operators, type of domestic wastewater treatment). The model can then be used to predict the response variable for any given set of input variables.  Step 4: Optimize the process: The RSM model can be used to optimize the domestic wastewater management process by identifying the input variables that have the greatest impact on the response variable and adjusting them to achieve the desired performance efficiency.  Step 5: Validate the model: The final step is to validate the RSM model by testing it on new data. This ensures that the model is accurate and reliable and can be used to optimize the performance process over time.    The effective domestic wastewater management levels were categorized from the performance data of domestic wastewater management in some Southeast Asian cities such as China, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore toward SDG 6 of safely domestic wastewater management in this research (ADB, 2016 ; UNICEF, 2020 ; WHO/UNICEF, 2021 ). For the domestic wastewater ‘collection performance’ indicator, the level was assigned ‘satisfactory’ if the collected domestic wastewater was more than 80% of the domestic wastewater generated, ‘moderate’ if the collected domestic wastewater was from 50 to 80%, and ‘poor’ if the collected domestic wastewater was less than 50% (such as Malang, Indonesia; Kathmandu, Nepal; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Punjab, India). For the domestic wastewater ‘treatment performance’ indicator, the level was assigned ‘satisfactory’ if there were functioning high-type wastewater treatment technology(s) such as membrane sequencing batch reactor, activated sludge or aerated lagoon operated by operator(s) and a monitoring report of domestic wastewater treatment performance. The ‘moderate’ treatment efficiencies were assigned if the cities employ medium-type wastewater treatment technology(s) such as oxidation ditch operated by operator(s), and without a monitoring report of treatment performance. The ‘poor’ treatment efficiencies are assigned if the cities were functioning low-type wastewater treatment technology(s) such as stabilization pond or wetland and without operator(s). For the cost-benefit ratio indicator, the level was assigned ‘satisfactory’ if the cost-benefitratio was more than 1.00, ‘moderate’ if the cost-benefitratio was from 0.50 to 1.00 and ‘poor if the cost-benefitratio was less than 0.50. For the social content indicator, the level was identified based on the findings obtained from questionnaire surveys similar to the collection performance indicator. In this research, domestic wastewater performance of a city is considered to be an encouraging alternative towards the SDG6 targets if all the four indicators were found to be satisfactory. Domestic wastewater management sustainability chart was applied and tested with actual situations of some Southeast Asian cities having similar domestic wastewater management conditions. The findings obtained from this research could be utilized to provide the conditions to accomplish the SDG6 targets.  3 Results and discussion The current situations of domestic wastewater management of 55 surveyed cities in Thailand were assessed based on four indicators as listed in Table 1 . The relationships between each domestic wastewater management indicator and its influencing factors were conducted utilizing RSM as presented below: 3.1 Collection performance indicator The relationships among the wastewater collection performance, the number of households per city and capacity of wastewater treatment facilities are presented in Fig. 2  . It can be seen that 13 of the 55 surveyed cities were considered to have ‘poor’ wastewater collection performance, 36 of the 55 surveyed cities were considered to have ‘moderate’ wastewater collection performance, and 6 of the 55 surveyed cities were considered to have ‘satisfactory’ wastewater collection performance. From the RSM plot of Fig. 2 , capacity of the wastewater treatment facilities should be at least 20,000 m3  per day per 5,000 households to achieve satisfactory collection performance of more than 80%. The ‘moderate’ and ‘poor’ collection efficiencies of about 50% and less than 20% would occur for cities having the ratios of the capacity of the wastewater treatment facilities per number of households of 5,000:17,000 and 5,000:45,000, respectively. From the survey results, it was found that, due to inadequate budgeting and planning, most of the surveyed cities in Thailand are usually limited to provide effective wastewater facilities coverage. Previous studies by Taweesan et al. (2015a  and 2015b)  stated that capital and operating costs of collection services and treatment facilities were the key factors for achieving sustainable sanitation management as well as technologies and social requirements.  3.2 Treatment performance indicator The effects of type of wastewater treatment technology and number of operators on wastewater treatment performance are presented in Fig. 3  . It can be seen that 13 of the 55 surveyed cities were considered to have ‘poor’ wastewater treatment performance, 4 of the 55 surveyed cities were considered to have ‘moderate’ wastewater treatment performance, and 38 of the 55 surveyed cities were considered to have ‘satisfactory’ wastewater treatment performance. From the RSM plot of Fig. 3 , type of wastewater treatment technology had direct effects on the wastewater treatment efficiencies, while the number of operators per wastewater treatment plant had less effect on the wastewater treatment efficiencies. For example, a wastewater treatment plant employing activated sludge process (high wastewater treatment technology) to treat 30,000 m3  per day employed only two operators per wastewater treatment plant to achieve satisfactory efficiencies; while another city employing stabilization pond (medium wastewater treatment technology) to treat 20,000 m3  per day of wastewater had to employ five operators per wastewater treatment plant and achieved only moderate performance. This finding was confirmed by UNEP and SEI (2016)  and Water Aid (2019) which indicated that in selecting the effective wastewater treatment technology options, type of treatment technology and its compatibility with resources management should be considered to accomplish the SDG6 targets.  3.3 Cost-benefit ratio indicator The effects of operation and maintenance costs and the wastewater collection fees on cost-benefit ratio are shown in Fig. 4  . It can be seen that there were only 6 surveyed cities utilizing the wastewater collection fees as an alternative fund for operation and maintenance of wastewater treatment facilities. These cities were operating at a loss in which the wastewater collection fees were less than the operation and maintenance costs. From the survey results, the wastewater collection fees of most cities were in range of US$ 2–10 per m3  which could not cover the full cost of operation and maintenance. For example, a wastewater treatment plant employing stabilization pond system (low treatment technology) to treat 60,000 m3  per day would require about US$ 9 per m3  for satisfactory. Due to the current regulations and limited capacity of local government authority, it might not be practical to implement wastewater collection fees. Although there are some funding provided by the Royal Thai Government (RTG), many cities do not put high priority on the implementation of wastewater management, resulting in less budget for this purpose. Furthermore, due to high operation and maintenance costs, the wastewater management is commonly ignored or not undertaken properly. Previous researches by Weststrate et al. (2019)  mentioned the needed for government agencies to give high priority to wastewater management to protect the environment and well-being of the people and achieving the SDG6 targets of safe sanitation facilities.  3.4 Social content indicator The effects of health complaints and environmental pollution on the levels of social content are illustrated in Fig. 5   which presents environmental pollution complaints to be more influential on the social content level than health complaints. It was found that 33 of the 55 surveyed cities had households satisfied with domestic wastewater management and 11 of the surveyed cities were found to have ‘poor’ level of social content. For example, Chanthaburi city in eastern Thailand which had more than 80% (satisfactory) social content for domestic wastewater management received about 2 health complaints per 1,000 households per year, but more than 20 environmental pollution complaints. For a city having the poor level (less than 50%) of social content such as Prachupkirikhun city in southern Thailand, the number of health complaints and environmental pollution complaints were found to be 50 and 160, respectively. From the survey results, a major reason for environmental pollution complaints was uncontrolled wastewater discharges to public areas, resulting in wastewater pollution of nearby water resources. Due to inadequate domestic wastewater management, one of the most common health complaints was odour problems. This finding was confirmed by Arphacharus (2016)  who reported that the conventional sewerage system in Southeast Asia such as Thailand covers only 10% of the urban population in which more than 70% of untreated wastewater are directly discharged into public areas, causing more public health complaints.  3.5 Convenient solutions on safely domestic wastewater management to accomplish SDG6 targets In this section, some convenient solutions on safe domestic wastewater management were tested with actual data of five cities in Southeast Asian countries (Buon Ma thuota, Vietnam; Yogyakarta, Indonesia, Hadyai, Patong and Tharae, Thailand) using the four wastewater management indicators which were: collection performance, treatment performance, cost-benefit ratio, and social content. These five cities were selected because they have similar size and domestic wastewater management conditions which are non-sewered sanitation with decentralized treatment systems (CWWA 2009 ; Bill and Melin da Gates Foundation 2012 ). Details of the domestic wastewater management data of these five cities, presented in Table 2  , were used in plotting a domestic wastewater management effectiveness chart (Fig. 6  ) to accomplish SDG6 targets. In this research, a city is considered to have effective domestic wastewater management if all the four wastewater management indicators were equal to or greater than the ‘satisfactory’ level. Fig. 6  presents the results of domestic wastewater management of the five test cities in Southeast Asian countries, together with the domestic wastewater management assessment criteria for assessing the achievement of the SDG6 targets. It can be seen that none of them had all the four domestic wastewater management indicators meeting the satisfactory levels. Considering domestic wastewater collection performance indicator, most cities (Buon Ma thuota, Vietnam; Yogyakarta, Indonesia and Hadyai, Thailand) were found to be ‘poor’ or less than 50% of the collected domestic wastewater. An exception is for Patong city in Thailand which was ‘satisfactory’ because it has increased local taxes for some users (such as high-cost residential properties) to support wastewater collection services as well as the financial supports from the central governments in providing the funding of capital investment for expansion of sewage systems for wastewater collection facilities. As shown Fig. 2 , capacity of the wastewater treatment facilities in the cities of Buon Ma Thuota and Yogyakarta should be at least 70,000 m3  and 80,000 m3  per day, respectively, to achieve satisfactory domestic wastewater collection efficiencies. Based on the survey results, the limited wastewater collection facilities and inadequate operation and maintenance were found to be the main factors directly responsible for the unsatisfactory domestic wastewater collection efficiencies to accomplish the SDG6 targets on ‘safe water and sanitation’. These findings were also documented by the Satterthwaite (2016)  showing that the limited expansion of wastewater collection facilities and inadequate operation and maintenance were correlated with financial constraints and policies requirements which obstructed the efforts to accomplish the SDG6 targets. For the domestic wastewater ‘treatment performance’ indicator, the cities of Buon Ma Thuot and Hadyai were found to be “poor” or unsatisfactory because they employ the low treatment technology to manage their domestic wastewater which is ‘stabilization pond’. Often, inadequate domestic wastewater treatment facilities lead to contamination of receiving river and groundwater (Edokpayi et al. 2021 ). The domestic wastewater treatment technology of Patong and Tharae are activated sludge and aerated lagoon, respectively, which function appropriately, resulting in a ‘satisfactory’ level of domestic wastewater treatment efficiencies. From the survey results, the satisfactory domestic wastewater treatment efficiencies of these Thai cities were due to the introduction of a centralization policy and political wills of the local government authorises to support domestic wastewater treatment facilities (Eggimann et al., 2015 ; Wankhade, 2015 ). These important factors are not available in the cities of Buon Ma Thuot and Hadyai, contributing to poor treatment efficiencies of their domestic wastewater. For the cost-benefitratio indicator, it was clear that in all five tested cities were ‘unsatisfactory’ or less than 1.00. This finding implies that high operation and maintenance costs and low wastewater collection fees strongly affect efficiencies of the domestic wastewater management and services. As it was mentioned earlier (Fig. 4 ), operation and maintenance costs (such as gasoline, electricity and manpower) of Patong city employing activated sludge was about US$25 per m3 , while the wastewater collection fees which were only US$9 per m3  should be about US$16 per m3  to achieve satisfactory efficiencies. However, due to legal and socio-economic reasons, it might not be possible to increase the wastewater collection fees to cover the full cost of operations and maintenance for wastewater facilities, resulting in less or no budget for this purpose. Similar results was documented by UN-HABITAT (2021)  which emphasized that in choosing an appropriate wastewater treatment technology to accomplished the SDG6 targets, consideration should be given to operation and maintenance costs and its compatibility with available financial conditions. With regard to social content indicator, the cities of Buon Ma Thuot and Tharae were found to be ‘poor’ or less than 50%, except for Hadyai and Patong which were ‘satisfactory’. From the survey results, it was found that environmental pollution complaints were directly associated with the level of social content. From the survey results, the major reason for environmental complaints was related to illegal discharge of sewage to open drains or nearby environment, caused by limited expansion of sewerage systems as well as functioning of the conventional centralized systems. Similar findings reported by WaterAid (2019)  and UNICEF (2020)  referred to the inadequate service coverage of wastewater collection facilities, especially in high-density population areas which obstructed the efforts to accomplish the SDG6 for safely managed water and sanitation services. To address these problems, designing appropriate wastewater collection facilities should be properly planned to provide efficient wastewater collection and minimize environmental complaints.   4 Conclusions This research evaluated the existing domestic wastewater management of cities in Thailand and proposed convenient solutions on safely domestic wastewater management through four important domestic wastewater management indicators which were: collection performance, treatment performance, social content and cost-benefit ratio. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) techniques were developed to simulate the optimum conditions to achieve effective domestic wastewater management in this research. Domestic wastewater management effectiveness chart was applied and tested with the five cities in some Southeast Asian countries having similar domestic wastewater management conditions during the period January–June 2021. A city is considered to achieve effective domestic wastewater management in relation to the SDG6 targets if all four domestic wastewater management indicators were equal to or greater than the ‘satisfactory’ level. Based on the findings, most of the surveyed cities were found to have moderate wastewater collection performance (due to inadequate budgeting and planning for domestic wastewater collection and conveyances), satisfactory wastewater treatment performance, unsatisfactory cost-benefitratio (due to high operation and maintenance costs and no wastewater collection fees), and satisfactory social content. Some effective domestic wastewater management solutions to accomplish the SDG6 targets were proposed such as providing the capacity of wastewater collection to be 20,000 m3  per day per 5,000 households, and introducing the wastewater collection fees covering the full cost of operations and maintenance to achieve satisfactory efficiencies.
