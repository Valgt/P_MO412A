                  In global exports, the commodity banana generates billions of dollars annually, a market which is accompanied by the discard of extraordinary amounts of valuable agricultural material from banana trees, mainly pseudostems, leaves, and hearts (banana inflorescence). The recovery of high-added value natural compounds from agri-food by-products is an emerging topic with plentiful research focused on extraction techniques for the biomass valorization, highlighting the circular economy concept. In this context, the present review discusses the current uses and processing of the most abundant banana tree agricultural wastes (pseudostems, leaves and inflorescence). Multiple extractives and applications were investigated considering the banana type, physical-chemical characteristics, and co-product treatments. Strategic areas for human development, such as food, pharmaceutical, civil construction, energy, and fibers, are addressed in association with the use of banana biomasses, and correlated with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Finally, the social and environmental areas mostly impacted by the green chemistry and biorefinery were also highlighted for the banana industrial chain.

In global exports, the commodity banana generates billions of dollars annually, a market which is accompanied by the discard of extraordinary amounts of valuable agricultural material from banana trees, mainly pseudostems, leaves, and hearts (banana inflorescence). The recovery of high-added value natural compounds from agri-food by-products is an emerging topic with plentiful research focused on extraction techniques for the biomass valorization, highlighting the circular economy concept. In this context, the present review discusses the current uses and processing of the most abundant banana tree agricultural wastes (pseudostems, leaves and inflorescence). Multiple extractives and applications were investigated considering the banana type, physical-chemical characteristics, and co-product treatments. Strategic areas for human development, such as food, pharmaceutical, civil construction, energy, and fibers, are addressed in association with the use of banana biomasses, and correlated with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Finally, the social and environmental areas mostly impacted by the green chemistry and biorefinery were also highlighted for the banana industrial chain.

Nevertheless, the lack of consistent access to enough food (food insecurity) is a reality associated to climatic instabilities, misuse of natural resources, wars, low financial resources from families or populations, and epidemics or pandemics (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2019 ). Besides, expressive amounts of worldwide produced foods are commodities destined for foreign markets, affecting domestic supplies (Sunderland et al., 2019 ). Banana (Musa ssp.) is one of the world's most produced and consumed fruits, with more than 124 million tons per year produced during 2010–2020 (FAO, 2021a ; Lau et al., 2020 ). Historically, bananas have been a significant commodity since the 19th century (Wiley, 2008 ). In 2016, this cultivar was the world's most important (in value and volume) fresh fruit exported (FAO, 2021b ). The global exportation in the last decade is estimated at more than US$ 120 billion (OEC, 2021 ). After harvesting, bunches become commodities. In turn, the leaves, the inflorescence (“heart”), and the pseudostem are left in the field, generating large amounts of greenhouse gases (Lichtemberg and Lichtemberg et al., 2011 ; Ortiz-Ulloa et al., 2021 ; Redondo-Gómez et al., 2020 ). Typically, each banana tree produces only one bunch, and, after harvesting, the plant must be cut down to make room for the next (Borges et al., 2009 ). On average, each ton of bananas generates 3.6 tons of residual organic material (3 tons of pseudostem, 480 kg of leaves, 160 kg of inflorescences/rachis/bracts). Then, for the annual average production of 124.4 million tons, more than 447.9 million tons per year of organic matter are generated and discarded in the fields (Redondo-Gómez et al., 2020 ). The disposal of agricultural residues is a common practice, although it occupies large areas, modifies biomes, degrades traditional crops, generates immense volumes of waste, and, consequently, causes social and environmental problems (Foster, 2011 ; Ortiz and Torres, 2020 ; Sunderland et al., 2019 ). Since the formation of the Club of Rome in the 1960s, the big concern regarding the environment led to the search for strategies for sustainable development, aiming to mitigate the social, environmental, and economic impacts of human activity (Colombo, 2001 ; Mihailov and Sakelarieva, 2016 ). In 2014, the United Nations (UN) proposed 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), aiming to eradicate poverty, improve the management of natural resources, and promote health, to be accomplished by the year 2030 (Buralli et al., 2018 ; United Nations, 2015 ). The application of the circular economy concept fits the UN's goals. It proposes a production-consumption system that optimizes the use of materials and energy by integrating production with cascading flows (Korhonen et al., 2018 ). Various processes (e.g., chemical and thermal conversions, extractions, and catalytic reactions) are capable of transforming, converting, or recovering compounds (e.g., chemicals and fuels) from biomasses (Herrero and Ibañez, 2018 ; Hughes et al., 2012 ; Tock et al., 2010 ). The biorefinery concept is already well established in agricultural industries as biofuel, sugarcane, beetroot, instant coffee, and algae. Therefore, the principal production is followed by optimized serial extractions to obtain other compounds, accompanied by heat or electricity generation by the combustion of the cellulosic material (Hughes et al., 2012 ; Tock et al., 2010 ). However, this logic is not elucidated yet for the banana processing industry. The industrial needs for supplies, energy, raw materials, and the use of traditional transformation processes to obtain them result in problems for the environment and industrial operators (Erythropel et al., 2018 ; Perlatti et al., 2014 ). Most issues are related to the excessive amount of toxic and harmful chemical reagents, high waste generation, extreme energy and water expenditures, among others. The biorefinery concept proposes eco-friendly methods to overcome those obstacles with conscious resource use, following the green chemistry trends (Erythropel et al., 2018 ; Perlatti et al., 2014 ). This review concerns possible applications for the poorly explored banana tree by-products, namely hearts, leaves, and pseudostem, updating the banana biorefinery state-of-art already pointed out by other authors (Adeniyi et al., 2019 ; Kraithong and Issara, 2021 ; Lau et al., 2020 ; Redondo-Gómez et al., 2020 ). An overview of different applications of banana by-products at pharmaceutical, materials, and food areas is provided, with special attention to food-related uses as the main difference with the available literature, and as a strategy to improve the use of the different banana by-products. The handling and processing of the by-products include extraction procedures, and also composition, properties, structure, and applications of the recovered extracts, in association with the sustainable development goals from the United Nations.  2 Biorefinery emerging options A search of “banana” OR “Musa” at SCOPUS and Web of Science platforms returned over 21,000 documents published in the last 150 years. When associating banana or Musa with the words “by-products”, “co-products”, “wastes”, “residues”, and other possible variations, the number of publications increased more than four times in the last decade, as shown in Fig. 1  . One must note that the countries with the highest banana production are also among the largest producers of scientific materials about it (Fig. 2  ) (FAO, 2021a ). That is encouraging information since bananas are mainly produced by developing countries where the biorefinery strategies can result in good economic, environmental, and social impacts. Exploring the by-products of banana trees, following the green chemistry principles and circular economy concept, can be strategic to reach the UN's 17 SDGs. The subsequent topics provide information about the various compounds and recovery methods reported for pseudostem, inflorescence (heart), and leaves of banana trees. Fig. 3   shows the in-scope parts of the banana tree, and do not consider the corm, roots, and shoots (because they are left on the soil as support for new plant), and peels and crowns (not discarded in the fields). Many of the biocomponents detected on pseudostem extracts are widely applied in food industries, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, and materials sciences, as pointed out with major details on the topics about different applications, such as food, pharmaceutical, and material sciences. Therefore, the large and easy availability, and the biocomponents detected in those residues, make them an alternative and potentially environmental-friendly source for valuable supplies for the aforementioned industries. 2.1 Banana tree by-products 2.1.1 Pseudostem The pseudostem is the most explored part of the banana tree. It has a layer of leaf sheaths rich in nutrients, including simple sugars, starch, minerals, dietary fiber, alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, and various compounds with antioxidant activity (Abu Zarin et al., 2020 ; Kundarto et al., 2020 ). Also, it is suitable for the paper industry, production of natural fibers, technical textiles, composites, and as insulating material (Brindha et al., 2019 ; Cordeiro et al., 2004 ; Monzón et al., 2019 ; Sango et al., 2019 ; Díaz et al., 2021b ). Extracts and poultices of Musaceae pseudostems are used in Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and other traditional medicines to treat many kinds of inflammation, high blood pressure, diabetes, diarrhea, peptic ulcers, rheumatism, wounds, nephritis, uremia, and urolithiasis (Abu Zarin et al., 2020 ; Kandasamy et al., 2016 ). Unlike many synthetic drugs (that can induce pain, nausea, and vomiting), Musa  pseudostems extracts cause fewer side effects due to their low toxicity against healthy cells (Ramu et al., 2014 ). The proximal composition of banana pseudostem is presented at Table 1  , considering different cultivars and origins, with representative content of carbohydrate (from 43.03 to 66.3%db) and protein (up to 16.88%). Cordeiro et al. (2004)  studied Musa acuminata  Colla and determined the fibers were represented by lignin (12%), and cellulose (34.5%), and the minerals (ashes of 13.9%db) by potassium (33.4%), calcium (7.5%), magnesium (4.3%), silicon (2.7%), and phosphorus (2.2%). Brindha et al. (2019)  evaluated the fibers from the Musa  sp. cv. Poovan detecting about 17% of lignin, 34% of cellulose and 2% of pectin. Ramu et al. (2017)  identified the vitamins ascorbic acid, riboflavin, niacin, thiamine, vitamin E, β-carotene, pyridoxine, and pantothenic acid in Musa  sp. cv. Nanjangud rasabale. They reported the total content of nonessential and essential amino acids as 184.28 and 103.37 mg/g protein, respectively, and also expressive amounts of fatty acids, represented by hexadecenoic, (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic, octadecanoic, (Z)-9-octadecanoic, and eicosanoic acids. Concerning the bioactive compounds, Abu Zarin et al. (2020)  reported the presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, steroids, and triterpenoids. Saravanan and Aradhya (2011)  detected 38 polyphenolic compounds in Musa  sp.  cv. Nanjangud rasabale, quantifying 11 components: gentisic (51.37 μg/mg), gallic (40.57 μg/mg), and catechol (12.99 μg/mg) acids from the methanolic extract; pyrocatechol (23.11 μg/mg), (+)-catechin (17.53 μg/mg), protocatechuic (42.17 μg/mg), caffeic (50.07 μg/mg), ferulic (16.88 μg/mg), and cinnamic (12.97 μg/mg) acids from the acetonic extract; and tannic (38.14 μg/mg), and chlorogenic (4.51 μg/mg) acids from the ethyl acetate extract. Ramu et al. (2017) , in an ethanolic extract from the same cultivar, quantified p -hydroxybenzoic (62.68 μg/mg) and sinapic (37.06 μg/mg) acids, quercetin (6.06 μg/mg), and vanillin (7.07 μg/mg).   2.2 Inflorescence Within the banana by-products, the inflorescence is the most used in human nutrition due to its proximal composition of moisture (90.70–92.17%), carbohydrate (16.09–56.80%db), protein (1.53–19.60%db), fiber (23.71–52.16%db), lipids (2.25–6.45%db), and ashes (6.51–18.30%db), considering different cultivars and origins, as compared at Table 1  (Falowo et al., 2021 ; Fingolo et al., 2012 ; Liyanage et al., 2016 ; Ramu et al., 2017 ; Schmidt et al., 2016 ). This by-product is a non-conventional food plant (NCFP), since this group includes both unusual plants and non-conventional parts of already consumed plants (Sandjo et al., 2019 ). The “heart” or “bell” of the banana tree, consisting of the male and female flowers, pistils, nodes, and approximately 30 layers of bracts, emerging from the center of the pseudostem in 10–15 months after planting (Amutha, Sudha, and Saravanan, 2020 ). Its removal reduces the weight of the bunch, minimizes the friction among different parts of the plant, and prevents diseases caused by insects and fungi. Another effect is the maturation speed-up and fruit sweetness increasing once the inflorescence demands part of the sap (Borges et al., 2009 ). It is long explored as a traditional medicine to treat inflammatory, diabetes, liver, and renal diseases (Chiang et al., 2021 ). Apriasari et al. (2020)  pointed it out as a source of edible pigments, and its fibrous structure is used in many materials (fibers, packages, furniture, and other building structures). Musa spp. cv. Nanjangud Rasabale has a total concentration of essential and nonessential amino acids of 279.03 and 512.98 mg/g protein, respectively. Soluble and insoluble dietary fibers are, respectively, 12.45% and 53.31%. Sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, ascorbic acid, vitamin E, β-carotene, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, niacin, and riboflavin were identified in concentrations superior to ppm. Gas chromatography indicated hexadecanoic, (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic, and 11-eicosenoic acids (Arun et al., 2017 ; Ramu et al., 2017 ). The ethyl acetate extract from the Musa acuminata  inflorescence presented: catechol, myricetin, quercetin, apigenin, and gallic, syringic, p -coumaric, vanillic, ferulic, ellagic, and cinnamic acids. Methanolic extract contained: catechol, myricetin, kaempferol, apigenin, and gallic, chlorogenic, caffeic, syringic, p -coumaric, ferulic, ellagic, and cinnamic acids (Arun et al., 2017 ; Lau et al., 2020 ). The Musa paradisiaca  inflorescence CO2  supercritical extract contained: stigmast-5-en-3beta-ol, stigmast-5-en-3beta-ol, stigmast-5-en-3beta-ol, γ-sitosterol, 5,13-dimethyldotriacontane, stigmasterol, 2,3,4,7,9-pentabromodibenzofuran, 10-hentriacontene, nonacosane, 3,6,9-nonacosatriene, heptacosane, methyl2-hydroxy-2-(3-nitrophenyl)- 2-(4-nitrophenyl)-acetate, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, pentacosane, 3,6,9-pentacosatriene, and docosane (Correa et al., 2016 ).  2.3 Leaves The banana leaves are large, flexible, waxy, waterproof, and traditionally used to produce baskets and other fibrous objects. They are also used for cooking, packaging, serving food, polymers manufacture, or in medical applications, like diabetes control, LDL oxidation, bandages, etc. (Yingyuen et al., 2020 ; Kappel et al., 2013 ). The proximal composition of banana leaves varies with cultivars and plant origins, as also compared at Table 1 , showing moisture (91.01–94.65%), carbohydrates (1.91–54.26%db), fibers (19.83–39.17%db), ashes (9.65–22.24%db), protein (7.98–18.09%db) and lipids (3.58–9.60%db) (Egbuonu et al., 2016 ; Marín et al., 2003 ; Mubeena et al., 2021 ; Pawar et al., 2015 ; Selim et al., 2022 ). Minerals such as calcium (16.7 g/kg db), magnesium (3.6 g/kg db), potassium (25.1 g/kg db), and phosphorus (1.2 g/kg db) were reported in Musa acuminata  and Musa paradisíaca  species (Marín et al., 2003 ; Pawar et al., 2015 ; Rusdy, 2019 ). The fatty acids composition from Musa acuminata  reported the presence hexadecanoic, octadecanoic, (Z,Z,Z)-9,12,15-octadecatrienoic, (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic, docosanoic, 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic, and tetracosanoic acids (Charumanee et al., 2017 ). Sonibare et al. (2018)  detected more than 500 bioactive compounds in methanolic extracts of banana leaves from eight different species. The main phenolic compounds detected were catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, rutin, caffeoylquinic acid, and feruloylquinic acid. Ismail et al. (2018)  identified, in an acetonic stalks extract (Musa cavendish): terpenoids, phytosterols, phenolic compounds, fatty acids, hydrocarbons, and tocopherols.   3 Energy and fuel strategies The quantification of the carbon stock of agroforestry systems allows calculating how much carbon is transferred from the atmosphere to plants' different parts. This value is fundamental to assess how much a given agricultural system affects the carbon cycle and allows proposing environmentally favorable methods to reduce the carbon footprint. In the current situation, the banana by-products left in the field to decompose can generate quantities of CO2  comparable to orange, cocoa, and rubber production. For the analysis of the carbon sink, are considered the productivity (3.6 tons of organic residues of the banana tree for 1 ton of bananas), carbon-to-CO2  conversion rate (3.67), mean carbon concentration in the different parts of the banana tree (Fig. 3 ) (0.40), the dry mass of the residue (8%), the cultivated area of banana trees in the world (5248683.2 ha/year), and the production (124 million tons per year). The calculated value is 9.99 tons of CO2 /ha/year. This value is probably underestimated since not all regions have intensive production, and locality and cultivar could affect parameters such as the rate of conversion, the dry matter content, and the carbon concentration of the banana tree (FAO, 2021a ; Ortiz-Ulloa et al., 2021 ; Redondo-Gómez et al., 2020 ). Comparatively, if all organic residues from banana trees were used for electricity generation, it would provide 4.53 GW/year, assuming: banana trees have an average of 8% of dry mass, which produces 13.1 MJ/kg of biomass (1 PJ provides 46 MW), and a 21% electrical conversion efficiency (Tock et al., 2010 ). The energy generated by the combustion of the banana tree residues, considering one year of world production of this cultivar and the residues generated, is sufficient to yearly provide electricity for 1471 people, with an average consumption of 3081 kWh/person/year (EIA, 2021 ; Ritchie and Roser, 2020 ). Another option is the development of second-generation biofuels (in which hydrolysis releases fermentable sugars from the fibrous material to be fermented). The advantages of second-generation ethanol production are the non-use of food matrices, and low price, given the abundance of lignocellulosic material. Rachis and pseudostem are, therefore, promising options. Guerrero and Muñoz (2018) , after 72 h of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation, reached an ethanol concentration of 0.67 to the rachis and 0.56 g/(L∙h) to pseudostem. The authors also point out that optimizing the process and expanding the scale can produce up to 112 L of ethanol/day/ton db of pseudostem. Leaves are also fermentable by S. cerevisiae , as reported by Tan et al. (2019) , who produced 45.75 g/L of ethanol from petioles in less than 40 h. Thus, on the pseudostem production in 2021 (373.2 million tons), it would be possible to produce 2,925,888 m³ of ethanol/year. Considering the rich composition of these biomasses, the energy/fuel generation could be considered a very low-value application, yet valid if those valorous components were recovered before (biorefinery concept). 3.1 Applications in food industry According to the latest report from the World Food Programme (2022) , more than 800 million people worldwide do not have enough daily food consumption. The current hunger stage can be mitigated by better use of agricultural by-products. Banana tree agro-industrial by-products are promising sources of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, dyes, enzymes, fibers, texture, aromas, vitamins, antimicrobial, and antioxidant compounds. Their multiple applications can be great for the economy, whether by compound development and their commercialization or their direct utilization as/in food (NRCAN, 2022 ). Several extraction methods were applied to different banana cultivars and parts for the recovery of components with various applications, as presented at Table 2  .  3.2 Food Banana by-products have a rich nutritional composition, being used as the main ingredient in traditional or ritualistic dishes such: as Kol posola (cooked pseudostem), Koldil bhaji (fried inflorescence), Koldil mangxho (cooked inflorescence in spicy sauce), Patot dia maas (steamed fish in banana leaves), among others (Sarma et al., 2020 ), as well as incorporated into foods such as jellies, cakes, canned goods, beverages, cereal bars, cookies, extruded snacks, and bread, with good sensory acceptance (Abreu et al., 2021 ). Therefore, it is possible to infer that the banana by-products have no apparent toxicity, being suitable for direct human consumption (Chakraborty et al., 2021 ; Tasnim et al., 2020 ; Vieira Nogueira et al., 2022 ; Welli et al., 2020 ).  3.3 Fertilizers To reduce hunger indices, the UN suggests practices that increase agricultural production, such as greater access to productive resources and inputs. Inorganic fertilizers based on nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) are one of the pillars of the world's agricultural production. Three countries (Canada, Belarus, and Russia) produce around 80% of the input of potash (potassium-based fertilizers). Therefore, international instabilities such as wars, economic imbalances, and political fluctuations involving any of these countries will influence global food production (NRCAN, 2022 ; United Nations, 2022 ). Bhatti et al. (2021)  tested banana leaves mixed with cattle manure. The corn crop treated with this organic fertilizer presented plant height and diameter, number of leaves, fresh weight, and the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium compounds in the leaves, on the soil surface and subsurface, similar to using NPK fertilizer. Also, in rice plantations, the aqueous extract of the inflorescence performed better than inorganic fertilizers (Suganthi and Kavitha Saravana, 2022 ). These results suggest that the by-products are possible substitutes to minimize the dependence on inorganic fertilizer. Furthermore, oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus ) inoculated in a medium developed from banana leaves grew efficiently and presented good nutritional composition (Menon et al., 2021 ). Kazige et al. (2022)  adopted that same strategy to improve food security and increase smallholder farmer profitability in South Kivu (Democratic Republic of Congo).  3.4 Food additives: flavor, color, and texture The demand for additives must reach more than USD 50.53 billion until 2027. Furthermore, the search for natural sources of food additives with natural appeal is a market-growing and solid niche (Market Data Forecast, 2022 ). 3.4.1 Texture agents Texture is a consumption decision criterion and can be defined as the manifestation of rheological properties (Paredes et al., 2022 ). Thickener agents are essential to standardize food products, simulating different structures (softness, hardness, adhesiveness). The most used (starch, pectin, and cellulose-derived compounds) can be obtained from banana pseudostem (Li et al., 2021 ; Padam et al., 2014 ). Pectin with gelling properties was obtained with degree of methylation 60% and 70.4 grade. Yield stress, cohesiveness, hardness, and shear modulus were slightly inferior to citrus pectin, and the extraction yield was over than 23% (Rajendran and Harikumaran Thampi, 2021 ). Mohd Ali et al. (2021)  identified different starches in different pseudostem fractions, with extraction yields of 6.89–11.97%, and gelatinization temperature of 71.15–76.50 °C. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), used as structure substitutes, stabilizers, and encapsulant agents, were produced from the pseudostem. CMC had a degree of substitution (DS) of 0.75, viscosity 4033 cPs in 2% solution (w/v), crystallinity 38.33%, and purity 98.63% (Adinugraha et al., 2005 ). Yuliasmi et al. (2019)  obtained CMC in a similar method and proximal DS. Diarsa and Gupte (2021)  reported MCC with degree of crystallinity (0.6) and thermal stability (340 °C) similar to commercial ones.  3.4.2 Color agents Anthocyanins are found in the bracts of the banana inflorescence. Padam et al. (2014)  pointed out that, for 100 g of bracts, 250 mg of anthocyanins could be extracted (cyanidin-3-rutinoside). Riboflavin and beta-carotene were detected in small fractions from Musa sp. cv Nanjangud Rasabale (inflorescence and pseudostem) (Ramu et al., 2017 ). Flavonoids (luteonin) and tannins were identified on the pseudostem sap from Musa sapientum (Repon et al., 2017 ). Finally, chlorophylls A and B were extracted from the leaves of Musa acuminata (Vergeiner et al., 2013 ).  3.4.3 Flavor compounds Flavor is characterized as the interaction of taste and odor sensations caused by small molecules such as alcohols, ketones, and esters (Lomelí-Martín et al., 2021 ).Wang et al. (2016)  detected more than 30 volatile compounds in Musa balbisiana leaves and bracts. Borges et al. (2021)  identified vanillin, naringenin, and naringin in Musa acuminata leaves. Those compounds can also be produced by using agricultural by-products as substrate or enzyme source. For this purpose, the most desirable enzymes are lipases, alcohol dehydrogenases, and lipoxygenases (reported in Musa cavendishii  leaves), and the preferred substrates are those with unsaturated fats (Padam et al., 2014 ).   3.5 Antimicrobial activity against foodborne bacteria Non-polar extracts contain high concentrations of terpenoids, alkaloids, and steroids, while polar ones contain phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins (Kandasamy et al., 2016 ). Tannins form hydrogen bonds and denature bacterial proteins, damaging physiological homeostasis. Flavonoids provide the rupture of the cell wall membrane, compromising the bacterial lifecycle. Terpenoids (saponins), in turn, reduce the surface tension of bacterial cell walls, destroying their permeability and leaking cytoplasm (Budi et al., 2020 ). Musa sp. var. Nanjangud Rasabale pseudostem extracts produced with intermediate-polarity solvents (acetone, methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate) were efficient against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; hexane and chloroform were more effective against fungi (Budi et al., 2020 ; Kandasamy et al., 2016 ; Kusuma et al., 2018 ; Ramu et al., 2014 ) Leaves extracted with intermediate-polarity solvents presented good activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Citrobacter sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus faecalis, Shigella sonnei, and Enterococcus faecalis. The aqueous extract performed better against the biofilm-forming fungus Candida albicans (Ismail et al., 2018 ; Jouneghani et al., 2020 ). The inflorescence of Musa balbisiana presented a similar solvent/efficiency pattern against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolytica, Brohroctrix thermophacta, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus (Tin et al., 2015 ). Also, a protein extract was effective against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, probably due to electrostatic interactions between peptides and proteins in the cationic form with negatively charged molecules of the bacterial cell membrane, such as lipopolysaccharide in Gram-negative and lipoteichoic or teichoic acid in Gram-positive bacteria (Sitthiya et al., 2018 ).  3.6 Antioxidant activity in food products The action of polyphenol oxidase in fruits, and peroxidation in oils and meats were avoided by different extracts banana residues. They were applied to hamburgers (Schmidt et al., 2016 ), chicken meat (Novidiyanto et al., 2020 ), sunflower oil (Anusuya et al., 2013 ), on fresh fruits (Shomodder et al., 2021 ), package of rainbow trout fillet (Ahmadi et al., 2019 ), and in sausages (Rodrigues et al., 2020 ) to increase the availability and shelf-life. Pork burgers treated with ethanolic extracts from Musa cavendish inflorescence had better organoleptic acceptance (color, odor, taste, and appearance) in 60 days compared to those that were not. After 120 days of freezing-storage, the treated samples had significantly lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations, indicating a natural and viable food antioxidant function (Schmidt et al., 2016 ). Rodrigues et al. (2020)  evaluated the aqueous extract of different parts of inflorescence (Musa cavendishii) in terms of total phenolic content by the Folin-Ciocalteau method, and antioxidant activities by Ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) and 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). After 28 days, sausages treated with concentrations between 0.5 and 2% of the male flowers extract presented delayed lipid oxidation (TBARS test) and slightly pH changes; water activity, color parameters, and sensory acceptance remained equal compared to the control (without extract). The inhibition of enzymatic browning in fresh-cut guavas was evaluated after immersion in banana leaf extract for 5 min. After six days, through colorimetric analysis, the treated samples showed approximately 60% less darkening than the untreated and 70% less ascorbic acid degradation (Shomodder et al., 2021 ). Ethanolic extract of Musa sapientum var. sylvesteris leaves was used before packaging rainbow trout. Treated trout showed 21% reduction in lipid oxidation and pH reduction over the 40 days of storage at freezing temperature compared to untreated trout. The leaf extract showed carotenoids, flavonoids, chlorophyll-A, chlorophyll-B, and vitamin E (Ahmadi et al., 2019 ). Anusuya et al. (2013)  tested the addition of pseudostem extract in sunflower oil to reduce oxidation. The oil peroxide value, without treatment, was 158.19, with pseudostem extract 32.03, and using Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 29.79 meq/kg after 21 days. For free fatty acids, without treatment 19.19, extract-treated 9.3, BHT-treated 7.9 mg/g. Finally, p-anisidine value of 54.04 without treatment, extract-treated 20.23, and BHT-treated 14.97. Therefore, the extract showed similar activity to the synthetic antioxidant BHT.   4 Applications in pharmaceutical industry Different parts of the Musaceae plant family are used in Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and other traditional medicines to treat many kinds of inflammation, high blood pressure, diabetes, bacterial infection, peptic ulcers, rheumatism, and wounds (Abu Zarin et al., 2020 ; Atanasov et al., 2021 ). This potential is comprised on SDG 3 and discussed below. Different pharmacological applications of banana tree by-products are presented in Table 3  . 4.1 Anti-inflammatory activity Inflammation is a immune system mechanisms triggered by pathogens, damaged cells, toxins, etc. (Chen et al., 2018 ). The aqueous extract of Musa acuminata flower suppressed the cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression and prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) production. That extract, administered orally to male rats, also reduced prostate weight, decreased the serum dihydrotestosterone level, and improved prostate morphology. Those effects were associated with the extract composition, containing taurine, citric, pantothenic, and nicotinic acids (Liu et al., 2018 ). Different Musa acuminata extracts provided specific anti-inflammatory mechanisms (Table 3 ). The dichloromethane fraction extracted from the flowers inhibited cytokines (Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) activities, while the n -butanol fraction extracted from bracts had a better inhibitory capacity against Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and nitrogen-derived species. Both extracts presented values comparable with dexamethasone (Sandjo et al., 2019 ). Correa et al. (2016)  showed that at least 76.42% of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade system was reduced by the Musa paradisiaca inflorescence extract obtained by compressed propane. The action was attributed to triterpenes, such as lupeol. That is remarkable since the alternative pathway of the complement cascade system is responsible for up 80% of the complement activation of inflammatory processes.  4.2 Antiviral activity In recent years, the world population observed a growing threat of viral diseases, reaching its peak in 2019 with the first cases of infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which led to a notable pandemic effect from 2020. While other viral diseases are recurrent problems, the development of antiviral compounds is costly, slow, and usually presents side effects. Then, the search for new drugs with antiviral effects has gained giant proportions. According to Panda et al. (2020) , pseudostem extracts from different cultivars showed antiviral activities against Chikungunya fever (CHICKV-899) and yellow fever (YFV-17D) viruses. The numbers of deaths by CHICKV-899 are below the reality, but the estimative is more than 8000 annually only in South and Central America (Lima Neto et al., 2019 ). YFV-17D was responsible for more than 30,000 deaths in 2018 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018 ). The antiviral compounds were not isolated, although ethanolic and acetonic extracts provided higher activities than hexane or aqueous solutions, suggesting that the bioactive compounds are neither too hydrophobic nor too hydrophilic. Panda et al. (2020)  also compared their best extracts with traditional drugs, namely 2′,5′-bis-O -trityl uridine, and favipiravir, which are RNA polymerase inhibitors for YFV-17D and CHICKV-899, respectively (García et al., 2017 ). Ethanolic extract of Musa  spp. from fougamou cultivar at 2.4 μg/ml and 0.87 μg/ml of 2′,5′-bis-O -trityl uridine resulted in 50% inhibition of yellow fever viral replication. Meanwhile, 2.65 μg/ml of favipiravir and 12.1 μg/ml of Musa ssp. fougamou resulted in 50% inhibition of Chikungunya viral replication. 100 μL of the sap of the Musa paradisiaca pseudostem showed antiviral activity against Hepatitis A (HAV-10), which was responsible for more than 7000 deaths in 2016 (Abdel Ghany et al., 2019 ; WHO, 2021a ). The cytopathic effect inhibition and the protective mechanisms were probably due to phlobotannins, anthraquinones, and flavonoids (Abdel Ghany et al., 2019 ).  4.3 Anti-bacterial, anti-helminthic, anti-protozoal, and larvicide activities In recent decades, drug resistance from multiple microorganisms has increased rapidly, and the search for new treatments has become a global public health priority. Thus, there is a growing interest in new treatment techniques, for instance, antibiotic-combined therapies and natural extracts (Ramu et al., 2014 ). Musa paradisiaca and Musa acuminata leaves extracts were tested against Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant, which is related to sepsis in debilitated patients. The extracts responses were comparable with clindamycin (Sivasamugham et al., 2021 ). This antimicrobial effect is due to alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoids, and tannins (Ismail et al., 2018 ; Karuppiah and Mustaffa, 2013 ; Sivasamugham et al., 2021 ). Sandjo et al. (2019)  showed that Musa acuminata methanolic extract had antitrypanosomal (Trypanosoma cruzi) and antileishmanial (Leishmania chagasi) activities equivalent to the commonly used drugs (benidazole and amphotericin B, respectively). Bagavan and Rahuman (2011)  tested Musa paradisiaca inflorescence extracts against the growth of the larvae Anopheles vagus (transmitter of malaria, more than 600,000 deaths in 2021) and Culex vishnui (causes Japanese encephalitis, more than 13,000 deaths/year) (WHO, 2019 , 2021b ). The best larvicidal results were obtained with more polar solvents (methanol, acetone, and chloroform were better than hexane and ethyl acetate). The methanolic extract presented the lowest lethal concentration to kill 90% of all the exposed parasites; 1 mg/mL killed all larvae tested.  4.4 Antiproliferative activity Neoplasm (cancer) is the name of several diseases caused by the abnormal and disordered growth of cells in the body that do not respond correctly to organic stimuli and killed approximately 10 million people in 2020 (WHO, 2022 ). Thus, compounds with antiproliferative action are essential to inhibit/suppress the erratic cell cycle. Antiproliferative activity was observed from the banana heart due to its high dietary fiber content, indicating a prebiotic potential for promoting the growth of Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Their fermentation generates short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate, which have antiproliferative activity on HT29 cells (colon cancer-related). Butyrate is absorbed by the intestine and is related to disease suppression, including cancer (inducing apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis), chronic inflammation, and diabetes (Arun et al., 2018 , 2019 ). Other studies showed the cytotoxicity of different extracts of banana tree by-products against: HeLa (cervical cancer), HepG2 (liver cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), A375 (skin cancer), and BPH-1 (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Table 3  presents possible effects for interrupting the cells’ cycle proliferation. Díaz et al. (2021c)  detected the prebiotic capacity of the pseudostem pulp of Musa acuminata  dwarf cavendish for the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum  and Lactobacillus gasseri . The prebiotic action is due to the presence of cello-oligosaccharides (Cello-OS) obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic material of the pseudostems.  4.5 Anti-diabetic and antihypercholesterolemic activity The antidiabetic effect can be characterized by the inhibition of the intestine's α-glucosidases, which suppresses the absorption of the carbohydrates into the bloodstream, and by the restoration of β-cells (insulin-producing) (Ramu et al., 2015b ). Acarbose and Metformin are recommended drugs for patients with type-2 diabetes as they inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities and reduce the blood glucose levels (Ramu et al., 2015b , 2016 ). The ethanolic extract from pseudostem (Musa sp.  var. Nanjangud Rasabale) performed α-amylase/α-glucosidase inhibition similarly to the mentioned drug (Ramu et al., 2015b ). The isolated stigmasterol and β-sitosterol reduced the blood glucose levels by improving insulin levels through glucose utilization and glycogen storage pathways (Ramu et al., 2016 ). Chiang et al. (2021)  showed that the banana flower extract (95% ethanol) had 40.10 μg/mg of lupeol, an anti-inflammatory agent. Compared to Acarbose, bracts extract had 1.3 times higher α-amylase inhibition activity, and flower extract had 3.5 times higher α-glucosidase activity. Ethanolic extracts from bracts and flowers had a remarkable anti-hyperglycemic effect related to the inhibition of carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes while reducing diabetes-induced complications by inhibiting pathways related to aldose reductase and advanced glycation end-product (Vilhena et al., 2020 ). The extracts inhibited body weight gain, avoided the production of free radicals and lipid peroxidation, regulated the inflammatory response, improved insulin resistance, and reduced blood glucose and lipid levels, all related to diabetes mellitus (Ramu et al., 2014 ; Shanmuga and Subramanian, 2012 ). Advancing type-2 diabetes is correlated with increased Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, which causes vasoconstriction. Musa paradisiaca  inflorescence extracts showed ACE inhibition comparable to 0.25 μM of Captopril (Arun et al., 2017 ). The methanolic extract from Musa sapientum leaves reduced cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in alloxan-induced diabetic rats (diabetes mellitus) (Adewoye and Ige, 2016 ). Finally, unsaturated fatty acids in the different by-product structures help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases (Ramírez-Bolaños et al., 2021 ).   5 Material sciences Banana tree's different parts can be easily used for constructing simple fibrous structures such as baskets, panels, and decorative objects made by interlacing the leaves (Nongman et al., 2016 ). Recent works also portray relevant and complex applications in civil construction, material replacement, effluent treatment, and energy generation. Several material sciences applications to banana tree by-products are presented in Table 4  . 5.1 Air and water treatment The effluents treatment (air and water) appears in many UN's SDGs. For instance: the untreated effluents release reduction is part of SDG 6; actions against the release of toxic/greenhouse gases and environmentally sound management of chemicals are comprised in SDG 12 and, finally; reduce the number of deaths and illnesses caused by air and water pollution is part of SDG 3. Kumar et al. (2021)  investigated the use of banana leaves to produce porous structured activated carbon (SAC). The leaves were treated with KOH, carbonized, and then activated with carbon dioxide (CO2 ). The removal efficiency of carbon monoxide, CO2 , hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and oxygen was more than 66% after five consecutive adsorption cycles. The SAC showed promising performance in hardness, fixed carbon content, bulk density, moisture, and ash removal. Braga et al. (2018)  obtained a tannins-rich extract from banana inflorescence by hot percolation with acetic acid. It promoted coagulation and flocculation of iron ore sludge, reducing 98.78% turbidity and removing 99.24% solids, with a satisfactory efficiency for a low-cost coagulant/flocculant agent. Rigueto et al. (2021)  pointed out that pseudostem is a promising by-product for textile dye adsorbent. At the ideal conditions of 60 rpm, pH 1, 30 °C, and 240 min, the biosorbent removed 96% of BF-5G (blue). Due to the high cellulosic concentration in pseudostems, a cellulose acetate hollow fiber coated with TiO2 was developed (Table 4 ) to degrade waste textile and Congo red dyes. The structure presented a degradation efficiency of 93.4% for the waste textile and 96.96% for Congo red dye (Wafiroh et al., 2021 ). Misran et al. (2022)  developed an economical and reusable adsorbent with a great capacity to remove methylene blue. The work proposes the impregnation of H3 PO4  in the cellulosic matrix of the pseudostem for activated charcoal production. In 90 min, 0.1 g of the activated carbon adsorbed 99.76% of the dye and presented the capacity to five reuses without efficiency loss.  5.2 Construction and structural applications The use of resilient and sustainable materials is one of the focuses of SDG 11 (development of sustainable cities). Applying waste from agricultural production in civil construction is strategic for carbon trapping and reducing the emissions of using conventional materials like cement, whose production represents 8% of all CO2  emissions (“Concrete Needs to Lose Its Colossal Carbon Footprint”, 2021 ). Cement particleboards are structures used for construction or reformations, applied to interior walls, ceiling panels, and decoration. A mix of ligneous material, cement, additives (e.g., hardeners, color compounds), and water is used to make them. Nunes et al. (2021)  replaced up to 75% of the composition of the usual maritime pine particles with banana pseudostem fibers. The maximum banana fibers proportion increased thermal conductivity from, the bulk density, and the resistance against molds (Aspergillus niger  and Penicillium funiculosum), and presented higher dimensional stability and lower thickness swelling. Asbestos has several applications in many industries due to its great flexibility and chemical, thermal, electrical, and traction resistance. Although, according to the Furuya et al. (2018) , there is no safe concentration, nor time of use of this mineral that can be allowed due to its high pathological capacity, especially carcinogenic activities (more than 250,000 deaths/year). Iceland was the first country to ban it (1983); nowadays, more than 70 countries have condemned or prohibited the use of this fiber (Taiwo et al., 2021 ). Samuel Taiwo et al. (2021)  applied a compression molding technique to a mixture of jute, banana stem, paper, and cement to develop an asbestos substitute. The resulted hybrid fiber presented properties close to asbestos, such as compressibility, flexibility, and thermal conductivity. Stone matrix asphalt is an asphalt cover designed to maximize durability and resistance to deformation using a structural base of stone-on-stone contact. Due to the size of the stones, it presents voids that can cause excessive drainage, exudation, and segregation (Ferreira da Costa et al., 2021 ). The strategy used by Ferreira da Costa et al. (2021)  to complete the voids of the asphaltic mixture was the addition of banana pseudostem fibers to match the specifications of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Adding 0.5% of banana fiber reduced the drain down and the mass loss, and increased stability, compared to the asphalt mixture without banana fiber. Prolonged noise exposure is harmful to human health and can cause accelerated degradation of materials. Singh and Mukhopadhyay (2020)  developed a compacted structure from banana pseudostem. The material with random fiber orientation, and two different aerial densities (with the less bulky surface on the opposite side of the sound source) presented properties of acoustic insulation and sound absorption equivalent to other insulation fibers (natural, petrochemistry, or mineral). A more complex structure, unifying construction properties with sound insulation, was developed using banana pseudostem. Ferraz et al. (2021)  compared the physical properties of different lignocellulosic materials with commercial plasterboard, and tested sound dissipation at different frequencies. The banana composites had low densities and high porosities among the lignocellulosic structures. Also, the pseudostem composite provided sound isolation comparable to plasterboard when submitted to high frequency.  5.3 Polymers composites, tunning agent, and packaging Composite are structural materials formed by a continuous phase (thermoset and thermoplastics) combined, at a macroscopic level, with a dispersed phase (metal, ceramic, or fibers). Incorporating natural fibers into a continuous phase has advantages such as higher mechanical properties, low cost, greater availability, carbon trapping, and renewability. Possible problems like low interfacial adhesion, aggregates formation, and low resistance to humidity can be mitigated by thermal, chemical or physical treatments of the fibers. These processes increase the resistance to water absorption, the contact surface (by forming roughness), or the interfacial adhesion by adding hydrophobic covering agents. Treated fibers were applied in automotive, plastics, packaging, marine equipment, and spacecraft industries. Adeniyi et al. (2019)  showed several composites developed with banana tree fibers added to different polymeric matrices. The composites with banana fibers showed less flexibility and higher impact resistance than the pure polymers due to banana fibers high density and stiffness. Among the composites evaluated, polypropylene presented the highest impact strength and Young's modulus, epoxy showed the highest flexural modulus, and polyester showed the highest flexural strength and tensile strength. Azaizeh et al. (2020)  produced lactic acid by applying enzymatic hydrolysis followed by fermentation using Bacillus coagulans with yeast on banana stalk. To approach the biorefinery concept, two techniques were proposed (microwave-assisted and conventional heating) for the synthesis of poly (lactic acid) (PLA), a biodegradable polymer with several industrial applications, which was successfully produced by using the banana stalk as substrate (Jiménez-Bonilla et al., 2014 ). Sango et al. (2019)  added a water-soluble extract (WSE) from Musa acuminata pseudostem to PLA, changing the properties of the polymer. The WSE addition lowered the PLA glass transition and crystallization temperatures because it increased the crystallization velocity. Similar effect was obtained by adding talc to PLA in order to promote nucleation, improving the crystallization speed. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), also a biodegradable polymer, was modified with pseudostem fibers and nanocellulose. The film with 5% banana fiber showed higher tensile strength than PVA film, although it also had higher vapor permeability, water swelling, and lower elongation capacity. The addition of nanocellulose (up to 5%) to the fiber film solved the water permeability problem (Srivastava et al., 2021 ). Nascimento et al. (2021)  employed banana tree residues to develop a cellulose-based film from the pseudostem doped with phenolic compounds from the leaves. Banana tree film is a promising substitute for hydroxyethyl cellulose films due to the similarities discovered in X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric assays, and contact angle tests. The phenolic compounds were extracted using methanolic maceration followed by methanolic Soxhlet. The cellulose was extracted by mercerization, blanching, and by hydrolysis.  5.4 Textile fibers Lignocellulosic fibers have been mostly considered, academically and commercially, over the past two decades as alternatives to conventional human-made fibers for transportation, construction, and packaging. These fibers can also be used to manufacture technical textiles, where the final composite is developed based on previous requirements (the mixture of different polymers with natural fibers gives distinct properties such as elongation, tensile strength, and impermeability) (Bar et al., 2021 ; Brindha et al., 2019 ; Monzón et al., 2019 ; Sango et al., 2019 ). According to Apriasari et al. (2020) , banana heart fibers have high cellulose content (56.48%) and low wax content (1.05%), a density of 1.39 g/cm³, average length of 27.6 cm, and diameter of 79.6 μm. They exhibited a mean breaking strength of 60.1/s, a tensile strength of 178.17 MPa, a mean breaking elongation of 20.9%, and Young's modulus of 2.99 GPa, comparable with coir fibers. They are stable up to 200 °C, decompose at 400 °C and leave a residual carbon content of 15.48% at around 800 °C. Given these attributes, banana inflorescence fibers can replace synthetic fibers to manufacture nonwovens and textile products. Mechanically treated samples from pseudostem showed maximum attributes of load, strain, energy breakpoint, and tenacity – comparable to cotton and polypropylene fibers (Brindha et al., 2019 ; McKenna et al., 2004 ). The high strength of treated pseudostem fibers was possibly caused by the high pectin and cellulose concentrations, which hold the fibers together (Brindha et al., 2019 ).  5.5 Dye-sensitized solar cell Alternative ways of generating electricity from renewable sources are a priority of the SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy). Organic pigments (anthocyanin, betalain, and chlorophyll) are emerging as strategies to replace the usual silicon-based solar cells since they can sensitize solar cells (since carbonyl and hydroxyl groups promote the photovoltaic effect), are cheaper, and eco-friendly. Madnasri and Ati (2021)  report the production of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using anthocyanins from Musa acuminata inflorescence. Microwave irradiation enhanced pore formation on the electrodes, increasing the extract efficiency by 150,000 times. The final efficiency approached the turmeric and red spinach ones and was only 17 times smaller than the best DSSC.   6 Gap for alternative extractions The extraction methodologies listed in Tables 2–4  are mainly composed of classical methods, such as Soxhlet and maceration with organic solvents, and performed at atmospheric pressure. The application of green techniques for the recovery, transformation, and extraction of co-products from natural materials is an intelligent strategy to avoid the extensive expenditure of time (traditional methods need many hours), solvent volumes (considerable amounts of solvents are required), and the side-effects caused by harmful solvents exposure (central nervous, respiratory, digestive system toxicities, and carcinogenic effect caused by long-term exposure to compounds such as n -hexane, petroleum ether, methanol, and chloroform) (Karmee, 2018 ). Besides, few researches have been conducted for banana residues using emerging technologies, such as supercritical CO2 , compressed propane, headspace solid-phase microextraction, and ultrasound-assisted extraction, although most of them presented only the extraction aspects like yield optimization (Correa et al., 2017 ; 2018; Liu et al., 2018 ; Panda et al., 2020 ; Sonibare et al., 2018 ; Sitthiya et al., 2018 ; Vilhena et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2016 ). Therefore, there is still lack of information related to the use of non-traditional methods to value the banana residues. Pressurized Liquid Extraction (PLE), Supercritical Fluid Extraction with co-solvent (SFE-co), Microwave Assisted Extraction (MAE), Aqueous Two-Phase Systems (ATPS), Pulsed Electric Field Extraction (PEFE), Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) are contemporary extraction technologies that can be associated with the biorefinery and green chemistry concepts when GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) solvents are combined, such as water, carbon dioxide, and natural biodegradable compounds (citric acid, malic acid, choline chloride, propylene glycol, among others) (Benvenutti et al., 2019 ; Rudke et al., 2020 ; Sorita et al., 2020 ).  7 Environmental and economic approaches: challenges and perspectives The evaluation of the environmental impacts caused by banana tree waste materials is very scarce in the literature. The available data, related to microorganism's conversion of the banana tree biopolymers, up to 90%, into water, CO2 , and minerals, in approximately six months, indicate a promising life cycle compared to fossil-based polymers (Arif et al., 2022 ). Rodríguez et al. (2018)  compared banana fiber-based biocomposites, polyester with banana fiber (with and without chemical treatment, or with kaolinite addition for impermeabilization), and pure polyester resin in a cradle-to-manufacture approach. The results recommended the polyester with banana fiber without treatment as the best performance in several aspects such as climate change; ozone depletion; particulate matter formation; ionizing radiation; terrestrial acidification; freshwater eutrophication; terrestrial ecotoxicity; among others. Also, comparing the costs, the biocomposites (like banana fibers) were considered economically competitive. Likewise, Rodríguez et al. (2020)  verified that incorporating banana fiber (Musa paradisiaca) on poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and on high-density polyethylene (HDPE) reduced the midpoint impact categories of the fabrication of coffee jar lids when compared to pure PLA, most particularly, or to HDPE, although less relevantly. Different factors affected the influence of the banana composities, such as banana geographical production, agroecological conditions, and the banana variety. For instance, according to Coltro and Karaski (2019) , production of Cavendish banana (Musa acuminata) presents more than 1000 kg CO2  equivalent/ha as global warming potential, higher than the Prata banana (Musa paradisiaca). The biorefinery approach for the banana processing-chain (increasing the value of banana by-products) is still unexplored, therefore the economic aspects associated to the recovery of bioactive components from the banana biomasses can only be evaluated based on other fruit by-products. For instance, Arora et al. (2018)  valued mango wastes by (i) pectin extraction from the peel, (ii) pectin and oil extraction from peel and seeds, and (iii) biorefinery approach to recover oil, pectin, protein, lipids, fibers, phenolics, energy, and animal feed. Although the initial investment is higher in scenario (iii), this investment return was also much faster compared to the other two scenarios. Similarly, Manhongo, et al. (2021)  proposed three lines for mango waste valorization: (i) biogas-heat and energy, (ii) pectin, heat, and electricity, and (iii) sequential recovery of pectin and polyphenols coupled with heat and electricity. The authors reached the same conclusion as the previous study, with the biorefinery approach providing best economical return. Nonetheless, the drawback of mango biorefinery approach is the short fruit production period (four months/year), impacting in plant capacity and processing days. These disadvantages would not be relevant for perennial fruits-chain, such as banana, contributing to the biorefinery approach. In general, the biorefinery approach is initially more expensive compared to individual processes, but the return of this investment occurs faster when several products are obtained. Besides, from the environmental aspect, the biorefinery improve the use of a biomass by generating different products that may also return to the processing-chain (Manhongo et al., 2021 ).  8 Biorefinery from banana tree waste and the sustainable development goals Banana is a worldwide popular fruit produced in over 130 countries. Therefore, it is subject to stock exchange fluctuations and environmental and social issues (FAO, 2021a ; Foster, 2011 ). In an increasingly globalized world, the problems afflicting humanity are cosmopolitan and manifested through hunger, poverty, inequality, climate change, food insecurity, lack of access to dignified education, health, well-being, and basic sanitation, among others. These issues affect, directly or indirectly, the health and quality of life of populations. Then, the concept of biorefinery emerges as a strategy to mitigate those problems. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a biorefinery is defined as an industrial facility, or network of facilities, that integrates processes for converting and extracting compounds from biomass into products (preferably with high added value for the pharmaceutical, fine chemicals, and food ingredients industries), fuels (ethanol, biodiesel), and energy (heat and electricity) (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2008 ; Redondo-Gómez et al., 2020 ). The biorefinery concept is an ideal strategy for producing various industrial compounds from agricultural by-products through a cascade of processes, closed cycles, and energy flows that allow the implementation of a sustainable circular bioeconomy. This concept contributes to all three dimensions of sustainable development, namely social, economic, and environmental. Therefore, it is possible to contemplate many of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) from the United Nations (United Nations, 2015 ). Banana by-products are used in food and traditional medicine because of their curative or preventive properties against different health problems and as ingredients for the food industry. Therefore, the extraction and isolation of certain compounds from those biomasses represent a more efficient and sustainable use of them and a contribution to the population, contributing to reach SDG 2 (Zero hunger) and 3 (Good health and well-being). Besides, SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) is associated, since different banana parts can be applied for effluent treatments. Also, banana biomasses may provide alternative fuels and unexpensive materials to generate electricity (SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy), alternative construction materials (SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities). The SDGs 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and 13 (Climate action) are also fetched by the better use of the banana biomasses. Finally, other SDGs can be indirectly related, such as poverty eradication (SGD 1), the generation of decent jobs and economic growth (SGD 8), promotion of industrialization, innovation, and infrastructure (SGD 9), as well as the reduction of inequalities (SGD 10) (United Nations, 2015 ).  9 Future challenges and conclusion The banana agroindustry generates annually substantial amounts of solid wastes that may cause serious environmental, social, and economic problems if they are not properly handled. Besides, the main banana tree biomasses (inflorescence, pseudostem, and leaves) contain several relevant components with different application potentials, if adequately purified, such as in pharmaceutical, food, polymer, and fine chemical industries. It is worth mentioning that the use of environmental-friendly methods applied to value the banana by-products and wastes are not well explored, representing an opportunity to improve the banana processing-chain. Also, there is a knowledge gap regarding the life cycle assessment of banana tree by-products in applications other than biopolymers, which requires much attention to stablish new applications in pharmaceutical and food areas. Nevertheless, the existing studies already pointed that the better use of banana tree by-products can enhance the economical competitivity of the banana chain, and further studies must be conducted to properly clarify the advantageous of the use of the banana biomasses. Although the economic feasibility related to the processing of banana tree by-products is still unknown, previous researches conducted for other biomasses such as mango residues suggested that similar processes could be applied for the inflorescence, pseudostem, and leaves of the banana tree. Therefore, throughout this review, it was possible to point out methods, raw materials, and an idea of economic viability to achieve different UN SDGs.
