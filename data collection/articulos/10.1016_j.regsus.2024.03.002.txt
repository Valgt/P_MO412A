                  The county (city) located on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains is the primary area to solidify and extend the success of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China in poverty alleviation. Its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are intertwined with the concerted economic and social development of Xinjiang and the objective of achieving shared prosperity within the region. This study established a sustainable development evaluation framework by selecting 15 SDGs and 20 secondary indicators from the United Nations’ SDGs. The aim of this study is to quantitatively assess the progress of SDGs at the county (city) level on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. The results indicate that there are substantial variations in the scores of SDGs among the nine counties and one city located on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. Notable high scores of SDGs are observed in the central and eastern regions, whereas lower scores are prevalent in the western areas. The scores of SDGs, in descending order, are as follows: 62.22 for Minfeng County, 54.22 for Hotan City, 50.21 for Qiemo County, 42.54 for Moyu County, 41.56 for Ruoqiang County, 41.39 for Qira County, 39.86 for Lop County, 38.25 for Yutian County, 38.10 for Pishan County, and 36.87 for Hotan County. The performances of SDGs reveal that Hotan City, Lop County, Minfeng County, and Ruoqiang County have significant sustainable development capacity because they have three or more SDGs ranked as green color. However, Hotan County, Moyu County, Qira County, and Yutian County show the poorest performance, as they lack SDGs with green color. It is important to establish and enhance mechanisms that can ensure sustained income growth among poverty alleviation beneficiaries, sustained improvement in the capacity of rural governance, and the gradual improvement of social security system. These measures will facilitate the effective implementation of SDGs. Finally, this study offers a valuable support for governmental authorities and relevant departments in their decision-making processes. In addition, these results hold significant reference value for assessing SDGs at the county (city) level, particularly in areas characterized by low levels of economic development.

The county (city) located on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains is the primary area to solidify and extend the success of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China in poverty alleviation. Its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are intertwined with the concerted economic and social development of Xinjiang and the objective of achieving shared prosperity within the region. This study established a sustainable development evaluation framework by selecting 15 SDGs and 20 secondary indicators from the United Nations’ SDGs. The aim of this study is to quantitatively assess the progress of SDGs at the county (city) level on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. The results indicate that there are substantial variations in the scores of SDGs among the nine counties and one city located on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. Notable high scores of SDGs are observed in the central and eastern regions, whereas lower scores are prevalent in the western areas. The scores of SDGs, in descending order, are as follows: 62.22 for Minfeng County, 54.22 for Hotan City, 50.21 for Qiemo County, 42.54 for Moyu County, 41.56 for Ruoqiang County, 41.39 for Qira County, 39.86 for Lop County, 38.25 for Yutian County, 38.10 for Pishan County, and 36.87 for Hotan County. The performances of SDGs reveal that Hotan City, Lop County, Minfeng County, and Ruoqiang County have significant sustainable development capacity because they have three or more SDGs ranked as green color. However, Hotan County, Moyu County, Qira County, and Yutian County show the poorest performance, as they lack SDGs with green color. It is important to establish and enhance mechanisms that can ensure sustained income growth among poverty alleviation beneficiaries, sustained improvement in the capacity of rural governance, and the gradual improvement of social security system. These measures will facilitate the effective implementation of SDGs. Finally, this study offers a valuable support for governmental authorities and relevant departments in their decision-making processes. In addition, these results hold significant reference value for assessing SDGs at the county (city) level, particularly in areas characterized by low levels of economic development.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains  Poverty alleviation  Arid lands  Sustainable development capacity    1 Introduction Arid lands encompass approximately 41% of the Earth’s land surface and are home to over one-third of the global population (Jiao et al., 2021 ). These regions have great ecological importance and possess substantial potential as carbon sinks. Arid lands are abundant in wind, solar, and mineral resources, laying a robust material foundation for global economic advancement. The northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains is situated in the heart of Eurasia and borders the Taklimakan Desert, China. In this region, warm and humid air struggles to penetrate, which results in an exceptionally dry continental climate. The stability of the ecosystem’s structure and function in this region has become increasingly precarious because of the combined impacts of global environmental changes and human activities. As a result, residents in arid lands are confronted with elevated risks to their livelihoods. In recent years, the vulnerability on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains has increased, which has caused significant challenges to the sustainable development of this region (Wang and Fan, 2001 ). The international community has undertaken numerous significant initiatives to advance global sustainable development, with a particular focus on less developed regions. In 2013, the 11th  International Conference on Arid Land Development urged governments and international organizations to collaborate in addressing the pressing issue of environmental degradation and working towards sustainable development in arid lands. In September 2015, representatives from 193 countries and regions across the world collectively endorsed the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development during the United Nations Summit. This pivotal agenda comprises 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 248 sub-goals that provide a clear roadmap for future global sustainable development (Wei et al., 2018 ; Håvard et al., 2020 ). The SDGs are typically organized and implemented at the national level across all countries and regions worldwide (D’Alessandro and Besada, 2019 ). Therefore, research on SDGs primarily focuses on global and national scales in terms of spatial analysis (Tan et al., 2018 ; Xue et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). Cameron et al. (2018)  conducted a comprehensive review of recent academic literature and examined the experiences of 26 countries in implementing SDGs, highlighting the potential interactions among SDGs. Rasul (2016)  specifically explored the interconnections between food, water, and energy in South Asia to facilitate the achievement of SDGs. Omisore (2018)  assessed the environmental challenges that hinder the attainment of SDGs in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are differences in economic, social, and environmental development among different countries and regions. Hence, an assessment of sustainable development at the national level alone is insufficient to accurately reflect the status of global sustainable development (Yang and Liu, 2016 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). Previous research indicated that, until 2019, only 42% of countries and regions globally have implemented policies that effectively contribute to achieving regional sustainable development (Joseph et al., 2020 ). Existing studies predominantly concentrate on urban areas with high levels of economic development (Dolley et al., 2020 ), whereas research on SDGs in counties and cities with low economic development levels remains scarce. The northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains exhibits a generally low level of sustainable development. There are notable differences among counties and cities that emphasize the need to reinforce coordinated development across sub-regions. Furthermore, the characteristics of multifaceted industrial differentiation are pronounced in this area. National assessments often fail to precisely evaluate the true status of sustainable development in different regions. Consequently, a larger number of researchers considered the distinctive regional attributes of the southern part of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China to analyze the relationship between a county’s or city’s sustainable poverty alleviation capability indicators and its rural industry integration development (Zhang and Gulixiati, 2020 ). To investigate the heterogeneity among counties (cities) in terms of SDGs on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains, this study established a comprehensive evaluation framework for sustainable development in 2020. This framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the sustainable development status of counties (cities) on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. Moreover, in order to identify the top and bottom performers within each SDG category for each county (city), we selected 15 SDGs, namely SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 15 (Life on Land), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), and 20 secondary indicators from the United Nations’ SDGs. This study selected 15 SDGs encompassing economic development, ecological environment, social welfare, and other dimensions. SDGs often demonstrate a strong positive correlation with the level of socio-economic development. Consequently, developed countries and regions tend to attain higher scores in SDG assessments. This facilitates targeted investments in areas with poor performance, which maximizes the overall economic and social development in this region. This research holds significant reference value for various crucial objectives, such as consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation, proactively addressing the risk of relapse into poverty, driving rural revitalization, enhancing resource allocation efficiency, and implementing tailored strategies for industrial development.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area This study focuses on the research of nine counties and one city located on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains (in this study, the term “Kunlun Mountains” specifically pertains to the central and eastern regions, and the analysis focuses solely on these areas) (Fig. 1  ). Specifically, the study includes seven counties and one city situated in the Hotan Prefecture of Xinjiang, namely Hotan County, Moyu County, Pishan County, Lop County, Qira County, Yutian County, Minfeng County, and Hotan City. In addition, the study also encompasses two counties in the Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang, specifically Ruoqiang County and Qiemo County. Kunyu City was excluded from the specific calculation and analysis scope in this study due to a lack of available data. The study region covers a total area of 5.90×107  hm2 , accounting for approximately 37% of the total area of Xinjiang. In 2020, the GDP of the Hotan Prefecture reached 40.63×109  CNY, whereas that of the Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture was recorded as 110.63×109  CNY.  2.2 Indicator selection and data sources SDGs outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is jointly pursued by the United Nations and China, were given utmost consideration in the selection of indicators (D’Alessandro and Besada, 2019 ). This study carefully selected 15 SDGs and 20 secondary indicators (Table 1  ) to ensure the feasibility and comprehensiveness of the data and to promote comparability among nine counties and one city on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. The primary data used in this study were sourced from the 2020 Hotan Statistical Yearbook (Hotan Regional Bureau of Statistics, 2020a ), the 2020 Hotan Prefecture Statistical Bulletin of Economic and Social Development (Hotan Regional Bureau of Statistics, 2020b ), the 2020 Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture Statistical Yearbook (Bureau of Statistics of Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, 2020a ), and the 2020 Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture Statistical Bulletin of Economic and Social Development (Bureau of Statistics of Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, 2020b ).  2.3 Indicator construction The construction of indicators at the county (city) level on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains involves two steps: (i) data standardization for each indicator and (ii) aggregation of indicators within and across SDGs. For achieving standardization, the values of each indicator were recalibrated on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the poorest performance and 100 showing the best performance. In this study, data standardization was accomplished using Equation 1 :(1) x ′  = x − min ( x )   max ( x )  − min ( x )    ,     where x'  is the standardized value after re-scaling; x  is the original data value of each indicator; and max(x ) and min(x ) are the best and poorest performances of each indicator among the studied city and counties, respectively. The United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (Lee et al., 2016 ) does not provide specific target values or optimal thresholds for individual indicator, and some indicators are solely qualitative. In this study, the max(x ) and min(x ) values were determined by selecting the best and poorest performers across all city and counties. Consequently, the construction of SDG indicator for each county (city) located on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains was conducted by following two steps. First, the indicators for each SDG were readjusted to ensure consistency. Next, all 15 SDGs were aggregated into SDG indicators using equal weights. The arithmetic mean method was employed to calculate the value of each indicator and the overall SDG. This approach summarized the indicators of SDGs at the county (city) level and provided a comprehensive assessment of SDGs on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains.(2) I i  = ∑ j = 1  N i j    I i j   N i j    ,     (3) I = ∑ i = 1  N i   I i  N i   ,     where I i   is the score of SDG i ; N ij   is the number of indicators for SDG i  in a county (city); I ij   is the score of indicator j  in SDG i ; and N i   is the number of SDGs in a county or city. The score of SDG i  was derived from the recalibrated score of indicator j  within the county (city). Consequently, the overall score (I ) of SDGs for each county (city) was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the individual score of SDG i  for a particular county (city).  2.4 Establishment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) dashboard In this study, SDG dashboard was constructed to assess the performance of nine counties and one city on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains with regard to specific SDGs. SDG dashboard comprises a representation of four distinct colors (green, yellow, orange, and red). Green color indicates the county (city) with the best performance in specific SDGs. It is characterized by a score surpassing the mean value plus the standard deviation. Yellow color represents a suboptimal performance, with a score lower than the mean value plus the standard deviation, but higher than the mean value. Orange color shows the poorer performance, with score lower than the mean value but higher than the mean value minus the standard deviation. Red color signifies the poorest performance, with a score lower than the mean value minus the standard deviation. In the context of specific SDGs, green color indicates the best performance of a county (city) compared to others. Conversely, red color signifies the poorest performance of a county (city).  2.5 Correlation analysis This study employed Pearson’ correlation analysis in IBM SPSS 26 (International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, the United States) to assess the interrelationships among different SDGs. If a particular SDG exhibits a significant positive correlation with five or more other SDGs, it is considered to have a strong positive correlation. Conversely, if a SDG demonstrates a significant negative correlation with five or more other SDGs, it is regarded to have a strong negative correlation. For correlations that do not meet these criteria, SDGs were classified as those with no significant correlation.   3 Results 3.1 Sustainable development indicators Table 1  reveals notable variations among nine counties and one city for several indicators. Significant differences between the indicators under review were obtained by analyzing the maximum or minimum values among the indicators examined. For instance, the maximum values of eight secondary indicators, namely solar power generation, per capita GDP, number of people employed in scientific research per 1000 persons, ratio of the incomes of urban and rural residents, industrial waste gas emission per 1000 persons, industrial emissions per unit of GDP, forest coverage, and wetland coverage, are found to be at least 10 times greater than the minimum value. This stark contrast underscores the substantial differences observed across these indicators. Furthermore, the coefficients of variation for per capita GDP and industrial waste gas emission per 1000 persons, associated with SDGs 8 and 12, respectively, exceed 1.000, which indicates notable fluctuations in per capita GDP and industrial waste gas emission per 1000 persons among the counties and city located on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. Figure 2   shows the spatial distribution pattern of SDG score in the selected nine counties and one city situated on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. The scores for SDGs, in descending order, are as follows: 62.22 for Minfeng County, 54.22 for Hotan City, 50.21 for Qiemo County, 42.54 for Moyu County, 41.56 for Ruoqiang County, 41.39 for Qira County, 39.86 for Lop County, 38.25 for Yutian County, 38.10 for Pishan County, and 36.87 for Hotan County. This indicates that Minfeng County, Hotan City, and Qiemo County exhibit a high level of sustainable development capacity. Moyu County, Ruoqiang County, Qira County, and Lop County possess a moderate level of sustainable development capacity. Conversely, Yutian County, Pishan County, and Hotan County demonstrate a relatively low level of sustainable development capacity. Figure 2  also shows that there are high SDG scores in the central and eastern regions and low scores in the western regions. In the central and eastern regions of the study area, Minfeng County, Hotan City, and Qiemo County emerge as the top three with the highest SDG scores. Conversely, Pishan County and Hotan County with the lowest SDG scores are located in the western part of the study area (Fig. 2 ).  3.2 Performance of SDGs Figure 3   reveals that only Moyu County and Qiemo County lack any SDGs with a red color among the studied nine counties and one city. Pishan County, Lop County, Qira County, Yutian County, and Minfeng County have one or two SDGs with red color. In contrast, Hotan City, Hotan County, and Ruoqiang County exhibit three or more SDGs with red color. In addition, Hotan City, Lop County, Minfeng County, and Ruoqiang County have three or more SDGs classified as green color. In addition, Pishan County and Qiemo County have one or two SDGs with green color. In contrast, Hotan County, Moyu County, Qira County, and Yutian County do not have any SDGs with green color. The above analysis indicates that the central and eastern regions on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains have fewer SDGs with red color and more SDGs with green color. However, it is opposite for the western region in the study area.  3.3 Correlations among different SDGs The data presented in Table 2   examine the correlations among different SDGs. Several SDGs exhibit positive relationships with five or more other SDGs, including SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Certain SDGs show significant positive correlations. For instance, SDG 2 is positively correlated with SDG 6. Similarly, SDG 3 indicates a positive correlation with SDGs 9 and 15. Furthermore, SDG 4 demonstrates a positive correlation with SDG 13. In addition, SDG 7 is positively correlated with SDG 15, whereas SDG 12 is positively correlated with SDG 17. Conversely, several SDGs exhibit negative relationships with most other SDGs, including SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Significant negative correlations can also be observed among some SDGs. For example, SDG 1 exhibits a negative correlation with SDG 13, while SDG 5 is negatively correlated with SDG 17. Similarly, SDG 8 demonstrates a negative correlation with SDG 17. Furthermore, SDG 11 is negatively correlated with SDGs 12 and 13.   4 Discussion In this study, a comprehensive evaluation framework for sustainable development in nine counties and one city on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains was established. For this, 15 key SDGs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 17) were selected. Based on the analysis results, we ranks the scores of SDGs in descending order as follows: Minfeng County, Hotan City, Qiemo County, Moyu County, Ruoqiang County, Qira County, Lop County, Yutian County, Pishan County, and Hotan County. The findings differ from the principal component analysis results obtained by similar study that investigated the economic development level of 42 counties (cities) in Southern Xinjiang (Chai et al., 2016 ). Their research concluded that Moyu County, Hotan City, and Ruoqiang County exhibit the highest level of economic development, followed by Pishan County, Hotan County, Lop County, Yutian County, and Qiemo County. In contrast, Qira County and Minfeng County have the lowest level of economic development. This difference occurs because they only assessed the level of economic development. However, our study covered economic development, ecological environment, social welfare, and other aspects. Moreover, different evaluation frameworks produce different results (Zguir et al., 2021 ). Hence, the indicator system for evaluating the sustainability of developed and developing countries and cities has to consider multiple factors. For developing countries and cities, the priorities for achieving SDGs are the development of indicators, the assessment of progress, the enhancing of infrastructure, the establishment of monitoring mechanisms, and the standardization and validation of data (Lu et al., 2015 ). These also present the right directions for achieving SDGs (Sarvajayakesavalu, 2015 ). This study established a dashboard of SDGs to assess the performance of nine counties and one city on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains (Fig. 3 ). The objectives are to identify the best and poorest performers within each SDG for each county and city. With regard to the number of SDGs with red color in each county and city, Moyu County and Qiemo County exhibit the best performance, with no SDGs rated as red color. However, Hotan City, Hotan County, and Ruoqiang County have three or four SDGs ranked as red color. Among nine counties and one city, Hotan City, Lop County, Minfeng County, and Ruoqiang County have three or more SDGs rated as green color, signifying their exemplary performance. Conversely, Hotan County, Moyu County, Qira County, and Yutian County demonstrate the poorest performance, as they lack SDGs with green color. The aforementioned analysis highlights additional insights: Hotan City and Ruoqiang County exhibit the higher number of SDGs with both green and red colors; Moyu County does not have any SDGs with green and red colors; and Hotan County lacks SDGs with green color, but it has three SDGs with red color. The spatial distribution pattern of SDG scores (Fig. 2 ) and the results of dashboard analysis (Fig. 3 ) indicate that the central and eastern regions exhibit a higher degree of sustainable development than in the western region. On the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains, there is a substantial income disparity between urban and rural inhabitants. The per capita income of farmers serves as a partial reflection of the progress towards SDGs. From the perspective of spatial distribution, the per capita net income of farmers in Qiemo County and Ruoqiang County in Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture surpasses the majority of counties and city in Hotan Prefecture (Bureau of Statistics of Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, 2020a ; Hotan Regional Bureau of Statistics, 2020a ). Under unchanged conditions, the disparity in farmers’ income is strongly correlated to the geographical environment of each city and county. Ruoqiang County boasts an average altitude of less than 1000 m. Furthermore, it has a significant geographical advantage since ancient times because it serves as the second strategic channel that connects the five Central Asian countries and Xinjiang of China (Visvizi et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2022 ). The majority of counties and city in Hotan Prefecture are situated within the Tarim Basin, which result in sluggish agricultural development and low farmers’ income (Chen et al., 2013 ; Xu et al., 2017 ). Consequently, the eastern counties (Ruoqiang County and Qiemo County) exhibit higher SDG scores than the western counties (Pishan County and Hotan County). The SDGs have undergone continuous updates, evolving from a concept of sustainable development to a comprehensive ideological system (Liu et al., 2018 ; Allen et al., 2019 ). The concept started with the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals in 2000 (Motala et al., 2015 ) and progressed to SDGs in 2015 (Khan, 2016 ). Furthermore, updating the evaluation framework does not necessarily equate to an improved implementation plan for SDGs (Fan et al., 2018 ). Previous studies have predominantly focused on exploring the essence of sustainable development (Giné-Garriga et al., 2017 ; Munro et al., 2017 ; Rai et al., 2019 ; Weststrate et al., 2019 ; Giles-Corti et al., 2020 ). However, this particular study solely evaluated SDGs in nine counties and one city situated on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. In future research, it would be more valuable to address the key challenges that hinder the achievement of SDGs on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains, as well as to explore strategies that can effectively attain SDGs.  5 Conclusions This study focused on the underdeveloped nine counties and one city on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains, namely Hotan City, Hotan County, Moyu County, Pishan County, Lop County, Qira County, Yutian County, Minfeng County, Ruoqiang County, and Qiemo County. A sustainable development evaluation framework was constructed by selecting 15 SDGs and 20 secondary indicators from the United Nations’ SDGs. The evaluation was conducted at the county (city) scale to investigate the differences of SDGs among these counties and city. Approximately 50% of the indicators chosen for this study exhibit substantial differences among the counties and city located on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains. This study shows that the maximum values of eight secondary indicators are at least 10 times higher than the minimum values, including solar power generation, per capita GDP, number of people employed in scientific research per 1000 persons, ratio of the incomes of urban and rural residents, industrial waste gas emission per 1000 persons, industrial emissions per unit of GDP, forest coverage, and wetland coverage. The scores of SDGs for the studied counties and city are as follows: 62.22 for Minfeng County, 54.22 for Hotan City, 50.21 for Qiemo County, 42.54 for Moyu County, 41.56 for Ruoqiang County, 41.39 for Qira County, 39.86 for Lop County, 38.25 for Yutian County, 38.10 for Pishan County, and 36.87 for Hotan County. This indicates that there are obvious differences in the sustainable development capacity of the nine counties and one city. Out of the counties and city under consideration, Hotan City, Lop County, Minfeng County, and Ruoqiang County have achieved green color in three or more SDGs. In addition, both Moyu County and Qiemo County have successfully avoided any SDGs with red color. The findings from both SDG scores and dashboard analysis unequivocally indicate that the central and eastern regions located in the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains exhibit a commendable level of sustainable development, whereas the western region demonstrates lower levels. This discernible contrast can be primarily attributed to the geographical distinctions between the eastern and western regions of the study area. Certain SDGs exhibit positive correlations with five or more other SDGs, including SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. These interconnections highlight the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of these SDGs.
