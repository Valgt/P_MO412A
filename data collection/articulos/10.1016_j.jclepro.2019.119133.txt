                  The doctrine of Sustainability Science (SS) is widely acknowledged as a tool for attaining global sustainability and is becoming the core philosophy of national and international developmental agendas. Goal 4 of the United Nations-Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) clearly acknowledges the role education plays in the promulgation of Sustainable Development (SD) by acting as a thread that concatenates the other SDGs. Hence, it is gaining global popularity as an academic discipline. However, SS as a standalone course is yet to gain prominence in Indian education systems, even though certain principles and practices of this science have been included within existing courses like Environmental Sciences. The present work thus aimed to bridge the gap between SD and education through the incorporation of sustainability tenets within universities of India. The methodology involved an assessment of research dedicated towards environmental and social issues in India and identification of possible entry-points for SS within higher education through detailed scanning of the academic programs of various Central, State and Private Universities. Results indicated that none of the universities were offering SS and only half of the universities surveyed provided Environmental Sciences. Therefore, a template for SS syllabus relevant in the Indian context was designed. Besides, two models namely the ‘infusion model’ for introduction of SS as a separate academic course and the ‘diffusion model’ for customization of the existing courses by integrating the principles and practices of sustainability were also proposed. We conclude that the effective utilization of these models can propel the implementation of SS within Indian higher education for nurturing a future generation of students having sustainability ethos in their words and deeds for addressing the developmental challenges of India.

From piecemeal to holistic: Introducing sustainability science in Indian Universities to attain UN-Sustainable Development Goals Priya Priyadarshini  Purushothaman Chirakkuzhyil Abhilash ∗   Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development Banaras Hindu University Varanasi 221005 India  Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005, India  ∗ Corresponding author.      Handling editor: Prof. Jiri Jaromir Klemeš The doctrine of Sustainability Science (SS) is widely acknowledged as a tool for attaining global sustainability and is becoming the core philosophy of national and international developmental agendas. Goal 4 of the United Nations-Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) clearly acknowledges the role education plays in the promulgation of Sustainable Development (SD) by acting as a thread that concatenates the other SDGs. Hence, it is gaining global popularity as an academic discipline. However, SS as a standalone course is yet to gain prominence in Indian education systems, even though certain principles and practices of this science have been included within existing courses like Environmental Sciences. The present work thus aimed to bridge the gap between SD and education through the incorporation of sustainability tenets within universities of India. The methodology involved an assessment of research dedicated towards environmental and social issues in India and identification of possible entry-points for SS within higher education through detailed scanning of the academic programs of various Central, State and Private Universities. Results indicated that none of the universities were offering SS and only half of the universities surveyed provided Environmental Sciences. Therefore, a template for SS syllabus relevant in the Indian context was designed. Besides, two models namely the ‘infusion model’ for introduction of SS as a separate academic course and the ‘diffusion model’ for customization of the existing courses by integrating the principles and practices of sustainability were also proposed. We conclude that the effective utilization of these models can propel the implementation of SS within Indian higher education for nurturing a future generation of students having sustainability ethos in their words and deeds for addressing the developmental challenges of India.   Keywords Developmental challenges  Diffusion model  Environmental science  Indian universities  Infusion model  Sustainable development  Sustainable development goals  Sustainability science    1 Introduction Sustainable and equitable utilization of natural resources without exceeding the planetary and social boundaries (Rockström et al., 2009 ) is imperative for inclusive development and provision of a good quality of life to one and all as envisioned in the UN-SDGs (www.sustainabledevelopment.un.org ). Responsible consumption and production coupled with planet friendly behaviour will serve as potential solutions for several environmental and social issues of the countries (Steffen et al., 2011; Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2019a, b ). Moreover, the incorporation of sustainability tenets within higher educational curriculum plays a significant role in generating awareness regarding such issues and cultivating responsible behaviour for the sustainable use of natural resources at the national and local level (Bilodeau et al., 2014 ; Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform, 2017 ). There are several opinions which in the recent past have focused on deciphering the requirement of Sustainability Science (Kates, 2011; Bettencourt and Kaur, 2011 ) and the relevance of sustainable development (Clarks, 2007; Lozano, 2008 ). The growing need of education for the promotion of sustainable development (SD) has provided the required stimulus to an increasing number of universities to integrate sustainability concepts into their research, campus operations, out-reach activities and even into their assessment and reporting (Aleixo et al., 2018; Lozano, 2010 ). Various aspects of sustainability within higher education institutions have also been focused upon such as constraints associated with integration of SD in universities (Lozano, 2006a, 2006b ), sustainability assessment of existing university courses (Lozano and Peattie, 2009; Leal-Filho et al., 2009 ) as well as cultivation of sustainable behaviour, restructuring and collaboration for sustainable development (Lazzarini et al., 2018; Soini et al., 2018 ). Besides, Lozano and Peattie (2011); Tejedor et al. (2018)  and Dagiliute et al. (2018)  have even made attempts for the integration of sustainability science within universities’ curricula. Though Sustainability Science (SS) is a sought after program in most of the developed nations (Kates, 2011; Bettencourt and Kaur, 2011 ), this program is yet to gain prominence in Indian education system. Therefore, the introduction of SS in higher education will enable India to address various environmental and social issues of the country like climate change (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2019b ), contamination of air, water and soil (Khilnani et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2017; Singhvi et al., 2012 ), mismanagement of natural resources especially wetlands (Bassi et al., 2014 ) and energy crisis (Kumar, 2017 ) as well as from various social problems like rural poverty and inequality (Rani et al., 2015 ), food security concerns (Narayanan, 2015 ), agricultural emissions (Pathak, 2015 ), disaster management (Jha et al., 2015 ), and poor health care systems (Sahu, 2014 ). The timely implementation of the targets and indicators of SDG 4 (Education for Sustainable Development) which emphasize on the need of inclusive and quality education as a means for achieving social, economic and environmental nexus would not only help in disseminating the knowledge regarding the severity of these issues but also lead to the generation of possible solutions (Nasibulina, 2015 ; www.sustainabledevelopment.un.org ). Proper structuring and functioning of the education system of a country directly influences its economic success. Though, Indian higher education is the largest in the world after USA and China, yet efforts to promote sustainability sciences are restricted to few researchers and academic circles (Lazzarini and Foguet, 2018; Rienda et al., 2011 ). Target 4.7 of the SDG 4 emphasises the need of education to promote SD and lifestyles. However, the target lacks formulation of a national indicator to measure its progress (MOSPI, 2018 ). The presence of a global goal and targets for education reiterates the fact that education is viewed as an important tool for generating awareness about sustainability as a means of living (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2018 ). Although the Indian government has made significant strides in terms of primary and secondary education through various government sponsored schemes, the country’s performance in terms of higher education remains rather slow as evident from the fact that India requires USD 2258 billion in the education sector for the accomplishments of the SDG targets by 2030 while it faces a financial gap of USD 740 billion (Bhamra et al., 2015 ). Besides, even though no financial gap was estimated in case of primary and secondary schooling owing to efforts and finances allocated under the Right to Education Act, deficits amounting USD 301 billion were identified in case of ensuring quality technical, tertiary and higher education (Bhamra et al., 2015 ). In view of these predicaments, the present research aimed to strengthen the cause of sustainability and SDGs within the Indian higher education through the following objectives; (i) Evaluation of the present status of SS and related courses such as Environmental Education as a science based course within Indian Universities at the post-graduate level, (ii) Assessment of research and administrative efforts dedicated towards sustainability issues prevalent in India, and (iii) Curriculum structuring and framework development for the introduction of Sustainability Sciences within the education system.  2 Materials and methods A structured and multi-layered analytical approach, as illustrated in Fig. 1   was adopted for fulfilling the objectives of the present study. 2.1 Penetration of environmental education within higher education of India Assessment of present status of Environmental Education in Indian education was fulfilled in two stages. Primarily, university websites were visited in order to analyse which university offered courses in environmental science or its allied fields. For this purpose, the latest annual report published by University Grants Commission (UGC) (UGC, 2017 ) was consulted in order to get state wise lists of UGC recognised central, state, private and deemed universities. All the central universities and on an average two universities from each state (state public and state private) were selected for the analysis (refer Appendix (A) ). States having a greater geographical area as well as higher population density were given greater priority during selection. Additionally, universities present in metropolitan cities like Delhi, Bangalore, Pune and Chennai were more often picked since these are densely populated and often witness greater footfall of students. Additional details taken into consideration were;- At what level was the course being taught; under-graduate, post-graduate or both?  - Whether the university had uploaded a complete and comprehensive syllabus of the course on the website?  - What other facilities did the university offer that enhanced the knowledge offered by the curriculum (in terms of lab facilities, number of faculties present etc).    Subsequently, interviews and surveys with lecturers and professors of related fields and conversations with student groups was facilitated similar to the academic consensus for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) established by Sinakou et al. (2018) by facilitating an online survey among academicians. This was combined with direct observations and visits to various colleges in order to get a comprehensive picture. Secondly, in order to gain an in depth knowledge regarding the structuring of the environmental sciences curriculum, a review of the syllabus available on the websites of the central universities was carried out. Henceforth, the central universities of India were segregated into six regions and an approximate analysis was undertaken to determine the scope and coverage of environmental science course in terms of theoretical, practical, experiential/field-work and regional aspects covered.  2.2 Identification of the sustainability challenges in India An intensive Scopus based survey (www.scopus.com ) was conducted for identifying various sustainability challenges in India. A step-wise search was performed as queries like environmental or social issues in India yielded numerous and ambiguous results. Therefore, a combination of keywords (pollution, green economy, education, poverty etc) referring to key environmental and social issues and reflecting the transdisciplinary nature of sustainability (Tejedor et al., 2018 ) was used as the first filter. The data range was inclusive for publications from 2000 to 2018 (second filter) so that focus could be retained on recent publications. Moreover, the document type was exclusive for ‘article or review’ and this served as the third filter in order to focus on in-depth research. The search results were further refined by incorporating the ‘and ‘/‘or’ connectors to view the synergistic/antagonistic effects obtained by combining two or more searches.  2.3 Integration of sustainability sciences within the educational framework SS in essence is an application based course comprising of theoretical ideas and problem-solving concepts. Therefore, successful integration of this course within educational institutions requires careful balancing of these two components in order to lend credibility to this application based science (Holgaard et al., 2016 ). As a result, the degree of alignment of various environmental and social issues with the Indian higher education courses was analysed under two broad categories; present depth of these issues within the Indian educational curriculum and ongoing efforts of Government to enhance awareness about them. Friman et al. (2018) had undertaken similar assessments to analyse the effect of policy suggestions on SD curriculum framework at two universities in Brazil and Finland. Henceforth, efforts were undertaken to frame a SS curriculum relevant for Indian universities by adapting from and examining existing courses related to this stream and research dedicated to it.   3 Results and discussion The results obtained by the present analysis were in agreement with the existing literature at the global scale suggesting that even though increasing recognition of SD is occurring in international forums its infiltration within the education sector is rather limited as illustrated by Lozano and Lozano (2014)  while developing a bachelors’ curriculum in Engineering for SD for Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico. Universities around the world usually offer Environmental Engineering at the Bachelors’ level (Cornell University, Drexel University, etc) which address sustainability concerns only partially through incorporation of only the environmental dimension of SD. Secondly, most of the international universities restrict the scope of this science to either ‘sustainability of the built environment’ or to ‘sustainable energy production systems’ which do not adequately represent the other dimensions (Table 1  ). Independent assessments carried out by Allen et al. (2008)  and Byrne et al. (2010)  regarding the teaching of sustainability concepts by accredited engineering programs of United States and Europe universities concluded that the approach adopted was primarily piecemeal in nature since most of the programs focused on integrating sustainability concepts like Design for Environment (DfE) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) within the existing curriculum rather than providing a holistic view to students. Secondly, even though the world has witnessed a number of international declarations (JCEETSD, 1997; EESD, 2004; UNESCO, 2004 ) from time to time for promotion of SD within education sector, their implementation at the regional and national stratum along-with incorporation within university curriculum has been rather limited and under-researched as evident from the works of Lozano et al. (2013)  and supported by the results of present study. 3.1 Higher education in Indian Universities The Indian Higher Education framework though evidently complex and extensively spread throughout the nation (refer A1) (Parvez and Agarwal, 2019 ) suffers from several inconsistencies such as incoherence between public/private sectors, ineffective governance leading to mismanagement of university facilities as well as lack of equity since majority of the working populace of the country is unable to enrol their children in private universities owing to excessively high fee structures (UGC, 2003; UGC, 2008 ). Environmental Sciences presently is one of the few science based courses being taught at the University stratum which focuses on both the ecological and social aspects of sustainability by addressing the problems associated with resource depletion and the effects of it on society (Ramadoss and Poyyamoli, 2011 ). Furthermore, the number of universities offering this course at the undergraduate and post-graduate level is considerably lower especially in the continent of Asia and other commonwealth nations when compared with the spread of popular science and engineering courses (Tahir, 2001 ). This was evident through the results of the first objective. 3.1.1 Status of environmental science in Indian Universities Data collection, its subsequent analysis and interpretation revealed that sustainability science in India is presently being taught in a piecemeal approach (Parvez and Agarwal, 2019 ). Therefore, of the three pillars of SD it is only the environmental aspect that gets a somewhat adequate representation while the social and economic aspects stand neglected (Lozano, 2008 ). A brief review of the Indian higher education revealed the following general trends for M. Sc Environmental Science (Fig. 2  ). As evident from Fig. 1 , the Central Universities lead the way in imparting knowledge related to environmental sciences as of the total forty-seven, twenty-six offer the course with majority of them providing the syllabus. The trends were reversed in case of State and Private Universities with very few universities having a separate department or institute for environmental sciences, and most of them offering the course either under the Department of Life Sciences or Geology. Environmental education as an engineering course was offered by twelve of the twenty-three IITs at the under-graduate and post-graduate level mostly through the Department of Civil Engineering (refer A1).  3.1.2 Regional assessment of environmental education within Indian Universities In depth assessment of syllabus and course modules available on the website of the Central Universities revealed that detailing of course was only present in the theoretical component of the syllabus. Only central universities of Punjab (www.cup.edu.in ), Himachal Pradesh (www.cuhimachal.ac.in ), Rajasthan (www.curaj.ac.in ), Meghalaya (www.nehu.ac.in ) and Nagaland (www.nagalanduniversity.ac.in ) provide details of practicals while the laboratory work in most cases was conjugated with the course work with no separate credits being allocated. However, individual efforts by some universities such as provision of elective course on ‘laboratory practice’ by Tezpur University (www.tezu.ernet.in ) and inclusion of non-credit courses like scientific writing and ethics, current environmental issues by Jawaharlal Nehru University (www.jnu.ac.in ) provided relevant examples on how to inculcate research aptitude within education and enhance the multi-disciplinarily nature of the subject. Moreover, efforts like incorporation of Arid ecosystem studies by University of Rajasthan and Landslide studies by University of Nagaland are highly appreciable since these enhance awareness regarding regional environmental issues (refer Appendix A ).   3.2 Recognition of sustainability challenges 3.2.1 Research focused on environmental and social issues The results of the Scopus based survey for assessing the major environmental and social issues hindering SD in India is depicted in Fig. 3  A & B. As evident, search queries for water pollution yielded the maximum results followed by air pollution, soil pollution and resource management (Fig. 3 A). The analysis reveals two striking features; the major one being that although majority of research publications are dedicated to environmental pollution in India (Khilnani et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2017 ), the same cannot be remarked for social issues (Rani et al., 2015 ) affecting the country except for the health sector (Fig. 3 A). Besides, it was also evident that present research in India is more focused on identification, characterization and assessment of pollution sources rather than its mitigation and management since keywords like green economy (Thapar et al., 2016 ) as well as energy crisis and management (Franco and Mandla, 2017 ) threw up the least number of results (refer A2).  3.2.2 Administrative efforts for recognition of sustainability issues within higher education Penetration of sustainability concerns within the higher education was determined under two categories, namely; present status of incorporation and ongoing government efforts for inclusion of sustainability principles. Analysis indicated that majority of the environmental and social issues affecting the country were included as curriculum courses within various universities although with lesser frequency as compared to popular science based courses (UGC, 2017 ). While air, water and soil pollution have comprehensive modules addressing their causes, sources and effects within Environmental Science curriculum, several universities offered courses in Urban Management, Land Resource Management, Public Policy and Food Technology which address various aspects related to green economy, natural resource management, urban/rural governance and agriculture (refer Appendix B ). On the other hand, administrative efforts primarily include provision of financial aids as grants by the UGC and declaration of University with Potential for Excellence (UPE) and Centre with Potential for Excellence in Particular Area (CPEPA) for promotion of various thematic areas such as Green Technology, Himalayan Studies, Biodiversity and Rural Development within education. Successful efforts include CPEPA focused on Biodiversity established at the Rajiv Gandhi University, Arunachal Pradesh as well as the one focused on ‘Bio-prospecting of certain important medicinal plants for health-care’ established at Osmania University, Telangana (UGC, 2017 ). However, education for Sustainability lacks efforts on either front.   3.3 Integration of sustainability science within Indian higher education The results obtained through the present analysis were in agreement with previous assessments undertaken by Lozano and Peattie (2011) ; which indicate that universities fail to incorporate the holistic concept of SD as well as its trans-disciplinary nature while imparting knowledge to students, limiting their understanding of several aspects of sustainability. According to Jones et al. (2008) , although there is a general consensus amongst lecturers and professors regarding the need to sensitize students about SD, opinions differ regarding the best possible method of doing so since many experts believe that enhanced focus on sustainability ideals might shift focus from the core discipline being taught. Meanwhile, Shriberg (2002)  provides various examples of frameworks in place for assessment of sustainable development within education. Besides, Majumdar (2012)  reviewed the scope of SD within Technical Vocational Education and Training and possible frameworks for its inclusion within curriculum. The present study therefore suggests two typologies for embedding SS within the higher education system. 3.3.1 Diffusion model for imparting sustainability science (DMSS) The ‘diffusion model’ (Fig. 4  ) or DMSS for imparting sustainability science incorporates integration of various concepts of sustainable development within existing courses (engineering, sciences, economics, agriculture etc) depending on the scope of the subject (Lozano, 2010 ). The framework comprises of three panels with the extreme left one indicating broad educational domains within which SS can be integrated, the middle panel providing examples of specific courses within these domains presently being taught by Universities in India while the right side panel illustrates specific SD Goals related to which awareness and knowledge can be disseminated subject to their successful incorporation within existing curriculums. As evident from the framework, the diffusion model attempts to include aspects of sustainable development within existing science and engineering courses in order to establish successful connections between education and Agenda-2030 (Table 2  ). In a similar assessment, Molthan-Hill et al. (2019)  had previously suggested three approaches (piggybacking, mainstreaming and connecting) for incorporation of climate change education within existing university curriculum.  3.3.2 Infusion model for imparting sustainability science (IMSS) Lozano and Lozano (2014) , stated that integration of sustainability within university curricula can either be through inclusion within an existing course or formulation of a separate course. Hence, the second template suggested for imparting education for sustainable development is the ‘infusion model’ (IMSS) which proposes combining the sustainability aspects of all existing courses into a single curriculum leading to the development of a stand-alone course (Fig. 5  ). Such a curriculum would help disseminate a clear and holistic viewpoint regarding SD to the youth of the country and help nurture key sustainability capabilities within them. Parvez and Agarwal (2019)  in a similar framework based approach evaluated the performance of Indian Higher Education Institutions based on the parameters of the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS) and University of Indonesia GreenMetric World University Ranking (UI GreenMetric WUR) concluding that sustainability strategies in India are not holistic or well-planned. In yet another assessment surveying and documentation methodology undertaken in four countries (England, India, Italy and Sweden) was used to ascertain the role of education in the health sector (Lawson et al., 2017 ). In accordance with the above case studies the infusion model of sustainability attempts to develop concrete linkages between university education and SD.  3.3.3 Curriculum development for sustainability sciences The UNESCO (2017)  report based on Education for Sustainable Development proposes the concept that educational curricula need to develop anticipatory, normative, strategic, collaboration, self-awareness, integrated problem-solving and systems thinking competencies within individuals in order to help them think critically, communicate effectively and act responsibly. The Scopus survey further revealed that although individual publications have discussed deficits in higher education (Sen, 2015 ), business sustainability studies (Sharma et al., 2017 ) and encompassing ethics in science courses, they lack depth. Besides, even though research has been dedicated towards inclusion of sustainability in major sectors of India like mountain development (Maikhuri et al., 2011 ), urban transportation (Verma et al., 2011 ), urban ecology and disaster management (Gupta et al., 2011 ), and institutional restructuring (Kamepalli et al., 2015 ) an in depth assessment of youth involvement and their perceptions on sustainability education (Kagawa, 2007 ), as well as the role international conferences and collaborations play in promoting SD (Berchin et al., 2018 ) has been rather limited. These results were also in agreement with that of Avila et al. (2018)  and Ferrer-Balas et al. (2010)  who proposed system-wide changes for removing barriers hindering sustainability integration within education. The proposed curriculum for SS in the present study attempts to comprehensively represent the multi-faceted nature of the science of sustainability by clubbing the environmental, social, economic, technological and political perspectives under one roof and conjugates them with the SDGs (refer Appendix:C ). The course-work on experiential learning in particular provides the much needed problem-solving viewpoint to the curriculum (Fig. 6  ) which in turn can harness reasoning, assessment and evaluation attitude among students (Holgaard et al., 2016 ). Several assessments previously have explored various dimensions of curriculum development in universities with Yusuf et al. (2018) assessing the role of stakeholders in tourism curriculum formulation while Strunga et al. (2013)  worked on curriculum optimization through analysis of student preferences and opinions. In accordance with these studies, the present developed curriculum aims to assess the role of higher education in SD.   3.4 Operational framework for implementing sustainability science in India As evident from the works of Aktas et al. (2015); Mälkki and Paatero (2015)  as well as Thurer et al. (2018) , formulating a university level course for sustainability or integrating sustainability concepts within existing curricula requires comprehensive advance planning and faculty agreement on common issues in order to avoid lack of coherence during implementation stages. Thus, identification of challenges hindering sustainability integration and devising of frameworks for incorporation of this course within educational institutions needs to be complemented with effective policy decisions related to higher education (Khuman et al., 2014 ). India, presently has national schemes and interventions better aligned with enhancement of overall literacy rates and increase in student enrolments as evident through the objectives of the National Literacy Mission (NITI Aayog, GoI et al., 2017 ). Therefore, if higher education needs to play a significant role in SDG attainment, the proposed frameworks and curriculum need to be incorporated within the existing educational administration of India within the 2030 time-frame. As evident from Fig. 7  , combined efforts and co-ordinated planning on part of the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD) and the UGC at the national level could prove beneficial. The NITI Aayog could help decipher the sustainability components to be included and setup a steering committee for implementation and progress monitoring. The MHRD could be held responsible for the budgetary allocations and ascertaining Universities which would serve as pioneers for the SS programme while the UGC could disseminate the course structuring responsibilities to various experts. Furthermore, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) could be held accountable for data acquisition related to SDG 4 national indicators (MOSPI, GoI, 2018 ). Strategic surveys within universities could also be initiated to ascertain the influence of sustainability sciences within lifestyles (Friman et al., 2018; Sinakou et al., 2018 ). Consequently, for a country with restricted scope for environmental education structuring a standalone curriculum for sustainability suffers from certain hurdles, major among them being overlapping modules with existing science, technology, agriculture and management courses along-with financial constraints, infrastructure and industry oriented research (Reddy et al., 2016 ). Science based policy recommendations would also play a significant role in the inclusion of sustainability tenets within educational institutions as well as SDG attainment (Hel and Biermann, 2017 ). Infusion of SS in the Indian higher education system is necessary primarily because sustainability is a multidimensional concept which necessitates the involvement of stake-holders and decision-makers from various allied disciplines and education could help achieve that (Yusuf et al., 2018 ). Secondly, sustainability advocates the ideologies of SD by linking ecological, social and economic parameters through participatory approaches and experience based solutions which is extremely relevant in fast developing economies like India (Khuman et al., 2014; Kakoty, 2018 ). On the other hand the two suggested frameworks for incorporation of sustainability principles within education try to acknowledge the capabilities of youth as generators of sustainable values by creating effective educational systems (UN-PRME, 2016 ). The results of the present study make it evident that youth potential in fulfilling the targets of the SDGs could be significantly tapped through formal higher education.   4 Conclusion & future perspectives The UN conceptualized SDGs attach significant importance to awareness and education as the basis for fostering sustainability in all aspects of life. The primary objective of the present study was to inculcate sustainable attitude within students through inclusion of sustainable development components within Indian universities. Results from the analysis revealed that although the country has an extensive higher educational system offering several academic courses, efforts dedicated towards inclusion of sustainability sciences remains limited both in terms of course development and implementation strategies. Based on the results the present study proposes two frameworks with the aim to bridge the gap between education and sustainability by initiating a culture of sustainability within university education. The diffusion model promotes the cause of sustainable development within various existing courses with the long term aim of enhancing sustainability awareness across major sectors influencing national economy through individuals who are well versed both in their subject area as well as the ideals of sustainability. On the other hand the inclusion model, through infusion of a separate course within the education system aims to establish a generation fully aware about the trans-disciplinary nature of sustainability, thus serving as mediators and policy-makers across sectors. Incorporation of sustainability sciences in a diffusive or holistic manner, direct interaction of students with stakeholders, coupled with liaisons between different sectors (for example agriculture and pollution control) using education as a medium for awareness propagation would substantially aid the cause of sustainability and SDGs in the Indian context. Awareness about the ideologies of SD, the SDG targets and indicators, applications of sustainable solutions in various sectors of Indian economy and the negative repercussions of unsustainable growth on humanity is bound to encourage students to consume resources judiciously and act responsibility towards the environment. Therefore, in essence, increasing awareness among youth about SD through more inclusive incorporation of sustainability principles and employing approaches that further enrich this science would go a long way in shaping a better future.

Appendix A Fig. A1 Higher Education system in India (UGC Report, 2017–18).  Universities providing higher education in India are grouped under five broad heads; (i) Central University (ii). State University, (iii). Private University, (iv). Institution deemed to be University and (v). Institutions of National Importance (established under State Legislature Act) each being set up based on the fulfilment of certain regulations. UGC established under MHRD is the apex body governing administration of higher education. Different regulatory councils like the AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education), MCI (Medical Council of India) etc are responsible for the management of different courses such as engineering and medical while there are two accrediting institutions; namely NBA (National Board of Accreditation) and the NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) established by AICTE and UGC respectively that are responsible for accrediting institutions and universities based on through evaluation and performance in various sectors of education. In addition to regulation at the centre, regulation at the state level is mediated through various State Education Departments and State Higher Education Council (Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu etc) that keep track of the number of authentic universities and colleges present within their state combined with the progress made in promotion of education through launch of new schemes or scholarships (www.education.kerela.gov.in , www.uphed.gov.in , www.tn.gov.in ).

Of the various courses being taught in these universities, science based courses receives the highest number of enrolments (4,966,190) followed by engineering/technological courses (4,781,913) (UGC annual report 16–17).  The number of universities offering this course at the undergraduate and post-graduate level is dismal when compared with the spread of popular science courses like botany or microbiology as well as engineering courses like B. Tech in Computer Science. Currently, environmental science as a course is offered by only 117 universities approximately of the 795 present with most of them having a limited intake capacity. It is thus evident that knowledge regarding environmental issues through formal education is not sufficiently penetrating within the Indian academia considering the national and local implications of climate change combined with ongoing global discussions focused around enhancing environmental conscience amongst youth. Master’s in Environmental Sciences in Indian Universities is a course taught over the tenure of two years divided into four semesters. Credit based system is followed wherein a student enrolled with the course needs to earn a desired number of credits within the stipulated time-frame through examinations held at the end of each semester (www.ugc.ac.in ). Knowledge imparted via lectures is accentuated through lab work, field and industrial visits and a dissertation undertaken by the student usually in the final semester.

Under the Joint Research Proposals scheme; India has developed research relations with countries like USA, UK, Israel, Norway and New Zealand with focus areas being; climate change, energy studies, sustainable development, food security, education and educational reforms, urban development, public health and community development and innovation. The various research collaborations initiated are;• UGC-UKIERI Thematic Partnerships (with UK).  • Indo-US 21st Century Knowledge Initiative (with USA).  • Indo-New Zealand Joint Research Projects  • Indo-Israel Joint Research Programme  • Indo-Norwegian Cooperation Programme (INCP; with Norway)  • Australia-India Educational Council (AIEC) primarily focused on higher education and quality assurance within education.    The above analysis makes it evident that education for sustainable development or enhancement and promotion of sustainability sciences in higher education for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals is a realm that still remains largely untapped. Besides, barring some courses like economics and sociology, majority of the courses dealing with the environmental and social issues prevalent in India are still relatively contemporary and affected from snags like inexperienced counsellors/instructors, inefficacious syllabus devoid of proper field-work and excursions (a pre-requisite for courses covering environmental issues) as well as limited scope and applicability which deters students from enrolling in them.
