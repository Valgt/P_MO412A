                  The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict is a dramatic world event. Apart from the loss of life, the present conflict has tremendous impacts on the environment, economy, and society. The conflict provoked a ripple of events with implications at the global level, especially in energy and food. The escalation of this conflict is imposing severe threats to achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) not only to the countries directly involved in the conflict but also to other countries, especially the developing ones that are more vulnerable to the economic crisis. In this editorial, we assessed the impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on Biophysical SDGs, Social SDGs, Economic SDGs and Partnership for the Goals SDG that consider all the previous dimensions. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict’s impact on the SDGs is variable. Biodiversity SDGs are mainly affected at the regional level (Russia, Ukraine, surrounding and European Union countries). Society SDGs are affected at local (e.g., SDG3 good health and wellbeing; SDG4 quality education) and global (e.g., SDG2 zero hunger) levels. Finally, the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict has world-level implications for the economic SDGs. Nevertheless, the ongoing conflict’s impacts are not entirely understood, and several uncertainties exist. Peace is needed to achieve the UN’s SDGs in 2030.

Graphical abstract Image, graphical abstract       Keywords Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict  Environment  Society  Economy  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)    1 Background On February 24, 2022, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia provoked a global tsunami with impacts that are yet to be understood (Pereira et al., 2022 ). A series of responses started to cripple increasing inflation and global insecurity in different aspects, including food, energy, and financial order. According to the World Bank (2022a ), a worldwide recession and possible stagflation are expected due to the conflict, a phenomenon not experienced since 1970. The impacts on the environment, society, and economy are still being understood, and the conflict’s length is unknown. At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had a tremendous impact on the global agenda. It reduced numerous countries’ capacities to reach the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2030 (e.g., Shulla et al., 2021 ; Wang and Huang, 2021 ). The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict has imposed an additional and strong disturbance on the global economy (Guenette et al., 2022 ). According to UN (2022a) , the conflict directly or indirectly affects billions of people. We have the biggest cost-of-living crises in a generation that is compromising SDG’s progress to have a better world in 2030. COVID-19 and Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict is affecting global efforts to achieve the SDGs because it is uncertain when COVID-19 will abate and the conflict will end. Before these events, many countries were already struggling to meet the established goals (e.g., Sarvajayakesavalu, 2015 ; Khalid et al., 2021 ). For many, it was already a race against the time (Arora and Mishra, 2019 ). The challenges to meeting the SDGs by 2030 will be even higher, given current conditions. Uncertain times come ahead. When the hostilities between Ukraine and Russia end is unknown, but it is clear that the conflict has had adverse effects on the SDGs. This editorial aims to identify the impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict on SDGs. We acknowledge that much of the supporting data and viewpoints are from news reports, and there are significant uncertainties about the conflict’s effects. We divide the SDG analysis according to the Stockholm Resilience Centre1  1 https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2017-02-28-contributions-to-agenda-2030.html    proposal on the impacts of the conflict on the SDGs related to the biosphere (Clean Water and Sanitation-6; Climate Action-13; Life on Land-15 and Life Bellow Water-14), society (No Poverty-1; No Hungry-2; Good Health and Wellbeing-3; Quality Education-4, Gender Equality-5; Affordable and Clean Energy-7; Sustainable Cities and Communities-11 and Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions-16) and economy (Decent Work and Economic Growth-8; Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure-9; Reduced Inequalities-10 and Responsible Consumption and Production-12). SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17) considers all dimensions –biosphere, society, and economy.  2 Biophysical SDGs The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict is turning cities into rubble, affecting the sanitary conditions of the inhabitants. Infrastructure (e.g., water and electricity networks) decreased drinking water availability in several cities, such as Mariupol and Chernihiv (Ukraine). According to UN International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), six million people in eastern Ukraine are struggling to have access to drinkable water2  2 https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/14-million-people-without-running-water-across-war-affected-eastern-ukraine   . Also, releasing toxic elements from ammunition and destroying industrial infrastructure have increased water contamination for decades, affecting drinking water resources3  3 https://www.eea.europa.eu/articles/solidarity-in-europe-in-times?utm_source=EEASubscriptions&utm_medium=RSSFeeds&utm_campaign=Generic   . This situation is serious and is expected to worsen over time. This will limit the achievement of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and targets 6.1, and 6.3 (Fig. 1  ) [See Table S1 ]. The destruction of residential areas and water-related infrastructure has dramatically reduced sanitary conditions, especially in eastern Ukraine, and threatens SDG 6.24  4 https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/ukraine/   . Shelling in forests and other wildland ecosystems are increasing the number of wildfires in combat zones5  5 https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-forest-fires-un-ocha-ukrainian-civil-protection-effis-media-echo-daily-flash   . The products released by fire (e.g., ash) and ammunition are increasing the degradation of surface and groundwater quality (Pereira et al., 2022 ). This affects the achievement of SDG Target (SDGT) 6.6. (Fig. 1 ).  The impacts of the conflict on SDGT 6.1 (accessibility to water) and 6.2 (hygienic conditions)6  6 https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-mariupol-residents-trapped-russian-assault-enuk    are severe in Ukraine, while water pollution has a regional impact (e.g., Black Sea)7  7 https://tudav.org/en/from-us/press-releases/press-release-a-war-in-the-black-sea-and-its-effects-on-marine-environment/    (Fig. 1 ; Table S2). It is well known that wars increase greenhouse gases directly to the atmosphere as a consequence of explosions, fires, spills, military vehicle circulation, wildfires, and pollution deposited on glaciers that contribute to melting. While indirect impacts include damaged infrastructure, energy usage from harmful sources, the number of refugees fleeing their homes seeking protection, humanitarian delivery aid, and deforestation for charcoal production8  8 https://ceobs.org/how-does-war-contribute-to-climate-change/   . Ukraine’s infrastructure and habitat destruction will affect the country’s capacity to decrease the vulnerability to climate-related disasters and improve SDGT 13.1 (Fig. 1 ). Also, Ukraine’s state of emergency will limit the capacity to implement SDGT 13.2 (UNESCO, 2011 ), and raising awareness and building intuitional capacity regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation is challenging. According to UNICEF9  9 https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/school-year-nears-tragic-end-ukraine-amid-child-deaths-empty-classrooms-and   , 17% of the schools in eastern Ukraine are damaged or destroyed. Also, almost nine million Ukrainians10  10 https://data.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine    cross the country border seeking refugees. This reduces the socio-economic conditions to implement SDGT 13.3 (Fig. 1 ). These impacts will be significant in Ukraine (Table S2). On the other hand, several countries, especially in Europe, are reducing their dependence on Russian oil and gas. Overall, the European Union (EU) wants to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels and invest in renewables11  11 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1511   . This has a positive impact on climate change mitigation. Warfare is known to have adverse impacts on marine environments (e.g., oil products, toxic elements), and in some cases (e.g., Gulf War), these impacts last for decades (Gerges, 1993 ). Although most of the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict hostilities are land-based, several combats have been recorded in the Black Sea, where some ships have been sunk and are leaking oil products12  12 https://www.kyivpost.com/eastern-europe/meduza-russian-scientists-say-the-black-sea-oil-spill-is-400-times-larger-than-reported.html   . In addition, the number of mines placed in the Black Sea is unknown, increasing the uncertainty of their impact on marine environments. Pollutants from rivers (Dnieper River) and deposited in the Black Sea can be highly harmful13  13 https://ceobs.org/ukraine-invasion-rapid-overview-of-environmental-issues/   . The conflict’s impact can potentially affect the Black Sea and its surrounding countries (Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, and Russia), reducing their ability to meet SDGT 14.1.  (Fig. 1 ).  Increased warfare activities and pollution drastically affect the Black Sea’s biodiversity. There are reports that more than 3,000 dolphins were found dead with marks from water mines or bombs14  14 https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/over-3000-dolphins-in-black-sea-found-dead-as-result-of-russian-war-in-ukraine-articleshow.html   . Therefore, the capacity of Black Sea countries to meet SDGT 14.2 is compromised (Fig. 1 ). The impacts of water pollution and biodiversity loss also affect coastal and marine protected areas. For instance, several coastal protected areas in the sea of Azov, Odessa, and Danube Delta, critical environments for migrating birds, are on the verge of being affected directly or indirectly by this conflict11 . This challenges achieving SDGT 14.5 (Fig. 1 ). The Russian-Ukrainian conflict can affect the achievement of SDGTs 14.1 and 14.2 in the region (Ukraine, Russia, surrounding, and EU countries) due to marine ecosystem degradation imposed by pollution. This situation challenges the Ukrainian government to expand the percentage of marine protected areas to 10% from a current level of 1.3%15  15 https://mpatlas.org/countries/UKR    (Table S2). War has directly (e.g., shelling, wildfires) and indirectly (e.g., refugee camp construction) increased terrestrial ecosystem degradation (Salemi et al., 2021 ; Pereira et al., 2022 ). Previous research has identified that war increases physical and chemical soil degradation, water pollution (Pereira et al., 2020 ), and deforestation and reduces the capacity of the ecosystems to supply ecosystem services (Francis and Krishnamurthy, 2014 ). In Ukraine, there is evidence of soil physical disturbance imposed by military equipment trafficking16  16 https://www.indepthnews.net/index.php/opinion/3245-breaking-the-impasse-on-donbass   , shelling17  17 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/russia-ukraine-war-update-what-we-know-on-day-15-of-the-russian-invasion   , trench opening18  18 https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-61191111   , and mass graves19  19 https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-dnipro-coronavirus-mass-graves/30530147.html    to bury the dead. Also, there is evidence that Russian cities (e.g., Belgorod) close to the Ukrainian border have also been shelled20  20 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/belgorod-the-russian-city-on-the-ukraine-frontline   . This is expected to disturb soil horizons and increase soil, and freshwater pollution, as some reports have already predicted21  21 https://euneighbourseast.eu/news-and-stories/publications/world-water-day-water-in-times-of-war-the-case-of-ukraine/   , 22  22 https://theowp.org/reports/environmental-crimes-against-humanity-russias-war-on-ukraine-risks-present-and-future/   . Several pieces of evidence suggest that this conflict is threatening critical ecosystems such as wetlands or forests under threat23  23 https://emerging-europe.com/voices/assessing-the-environmental-impact-of-the-war-in-ukraine/   . Overall, this hampers Ukraine and, to a lesser extent Russia from achieving SDGTs 15.1 and 15.2 (Fig. 1 ; Table S2). The continuous conflicts in agricultural areas will likely increase land and soil degradation. Before the armed conflict in Ukraine, it was estimated that more than 40% of farming areas were at risk of losing fertility (Ecoaction, 2021 ). Shelling, military vehicle trafficking and wildfires induced by the conflict amplify this problem and increase land and soil degradation for the decades to come24  24 https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-russia-war-soil-agriculture-crops   . This will reduce Ukraine’s capacity to achieve SDGT 15.3. Finally, the current armed conflict will affect the achievement of SDGTs 15.4 and 15.5 in Russia but especially in Ukraine due to the increase in biodiversity loss and habitat degradation, as mentioned above (Fig. 1 ; Table S2).  3 Social SDGs The unemployment increased in Ukraine. It is estimated that almost five million people lost their jobs, rising to seven million if the hostilities continue25  25 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1118012   . The sanctions triggered by the armed conflict provoked the abandonment of several multinationals, increasing unemployment. It is estimated that this armed conflict can affect 8.4 million people26  26 https://www.newsweek.com/russia-blames-sanctions-jobs-jeopardized-1691093   . The conflict had a global ripple effect, increasing inflation and food and energy prices. This has significantly impacted low-middle-income countries and threatens job recovery after COVID-19 (International Labour Organisation, 2022 ). However, unemployment increased in other countries such as Germany27  27 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-30/german-unemployment-unexpectedly-jumps-on-refugees-from-ukraine   . According to the UN28  28 https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/impact-ukraine-crisis-world-work-initial-assessments-enru   , labour disruptions can also occur in other countries (e.g., Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Moldova, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan). Previous research showed that the impacts of the armed conflict on inflation and unemployment would be global (Ruiz-Estrada, 2022 ), and likely this will be translated into the loss of purchasing power and poverty29  29 https://www.government.nl/topics/russia-and-ukraine/economic-consequences-of-the-war-in-ukraine   . According to FAO (2022a) , the food price index reached a historic high, an increase of 33.6% from March 2021 to March 2022. In this context, the developing countries’ achievement of SDGT 1.1 may be challenging. Although there is a clear negative impact on several economic sectors, others, such as the army, due to the rush to “increase national security” by several countries, benefits from the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict and employment in this sector can increase. For instance, the conflict boosted NATO’s defence spending30  30 https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/30/nato-defense-spending-putin-ukraine-war/   . Military industries look at this armed conflict as a “gold mine”31  31 https://inthesetimes.com/article/national-defense-industrial-association-war-weapons-lockheed-martin-raytheon-ukraine-russia-military   . SDGT 1.2 will be difficult to achieve, especially in Ukraine, Russia, and developing countries, since it is expected that the will increase poverty. According to the UN32  32 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/04/1116152   , this conflict can bring 1.7 billion people into poverty. Along the same lines, the expected global economic crisis33  33 https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/russia%E2%80%99s-invasion-ukraine-puts-global-economy-risk_en    will affect the poorest and the most vulnerable countries involved in this armed conflict and the part of developing countries. This will affect the achievement of SDGTs 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5. Also, the crisis increases the difficulty of implementing the measures described in SDGTs 1.a and 1.b in developing countries (Fig. 1 ; Table S2). Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict is increasing the famine and poor nutrition in Ukraine, Russia, and other parts of the world34  34 https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/03/ukraine-un-expert-warns-global-famine-urges-end-russia-aggression   . For instance, in Ukraine, approximately 45% of the population is concerned about not having enough food to eat (European Parliament, 2022a ). Millions have been displaced and require food. The cascading impacts of reduced agricultural production, reduced economic activity, rising agricultural product prices, and decreasing purchasing power will likely result in malnutrition and food insecurity FAO (2022b ). Both Ukraine and Russia are significant exporters of agricultural products. The two countries produce 78% of the world’s sunflower oil. In addition, approximately 50 countries import at least 30% of their wheat from Russia or Ukraine. In addition, fertilizer prices doubled, and energy prices increased exponentially (FAO, 2022b ), further impacting food security. The most affected are developing countries in Africa, the Middle East, and South America (FAO, 2022a ). In some of these countries, Russia and Ukraine supply 72% and 18% of the cereals consumed, respectively (European Parliament, 2022a ). According to the UN, this could trigger an “unprecedented wave of global hunger and destitution”. It was estimated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people affected by food insecurity increased from 135 million to 276 million. The armed conflict can potentially increase this number to 323 million by the end of 202235  35 https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2022/06/war-in-ukraine-threatens-to-unleash-unprecedented-wave-of-global-hunger-and-destitution-warns-un-chief/   . This conflict will make it difficult for Ukraine, Russia, and many developing countries to meet SDGTs 2.1 and 2.2 (Fig. 2  ; Table S2). Also, there is evidence that in Ukraine, harvests are being destroyed36  36 https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-besieged-farmers-fear-war-time-harvest-hell-2022-06-14/   , or the farmers are prevented37  37 https://www.npr.org/2022/07/03/1108118116/ukraines-farmers-face-russias-blockade-and-ordnance-in-their-farms-this-harvest    from collecting them, affecting the incomes and livelihoods of all involved in the supply chain. According to FAO (2022b ), approximately 30% to 40% of sunflower, cereals, and maize areas will not be harvested or will not be planted. In Russia, impacts on harvests may not occur. However, the imposed sanctions will have effects on exports and farm incomes. This affects SDGT 2.3 in Ukraine (Fig. 2 ). The increase in food insecurity (FAO, 2022a ) forces countries to increase their agricultural production to ensure the supply of basic products. This demand for food may increase agricultural intensification, negatively affecting ecosystems and reducing the capacity to achieve SDGT 2.4 globally (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The intensive shelling in Ukraine destroyed a seed bank in Kharkiv38  38 https://www.newscientist.com/article/2321008-priceless-samples-from-ukraines-seed-bank-destroyed-in-bomb-attack/   . The loss of this seed bank is bad for food security and genetic diversity39  39 https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-giant-seed-bank-risk-being-lost-war-rages-2022-05-31/   . This loss significantly impacts Ukraine’s ability to achieve SDGT 2.5 (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The conflict has disrupted agricultural investment and affected global agricultural markets, increasing the inflation of food products (FAO, 2022a ). According to UN40  40 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/04/1115852   , due to the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict, food prices reach a “new-all time high”, affecting especially the poorest41  41 https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/ukraine-conflict-and-other-factors-contributing-high-commodity-prices-and-food-insecurity   . This disrupted the global agricultural market and conducted to an escalation of food prices. The blockade of Ukraine’s grain exports through the Black Sea contributed to this situation and increased food insecurity in several countries42  42 https://www.rescue.org/press-release/russian-blockade-ukraine-food-exports-black-sea-port-will-have-deadly-consequences   . This will significantly impact achieving SDGTs 2.a and 2.b (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). Finally, the blockade imposed on Ukrainian grain exports and the tough sanctions imposed by Western countries affected food markets and price volatility43  43 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1118172   , reducing the capacity to fulfil SDG 2.c. The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict imposes challenges for the world in achieving SDGTs 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c. (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). Multiple hospitals and health care facilities have been destroyed during the conflict. According to World Health Organization (WHO), more than 100 healthcare facilities have been destroyed44  44 https://www.who.int/news/item/07-04-2022-who-records-100th-attack-on-health-care-in-ukraine   . In 2017, the maternal mortality ratio in Ukraine was 19 deaths/100,000 live births45  45 https://knoema.com/atlas/Ukraine/Maternal-mortality-ratio   . Although this value is below 70 deaths /100,000 live births (SDGT 3.1), it will likely increase due to the conflict. Pregnant women are the most vulnerable to conflict impacts (WHO, 2022 ). In 2020, the under-five child mortality in Ukraine was 8.146  46 https://data.unicef.org/country/ukr/   , below 25 deaths/1,000 live births, the threshold defined by SDGT 3.2. However, child mortality is increasing due to the conflict, as highlighted by UNICEF47  47 https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14889.doc.htm   . Child mortality can increase in other countries (Africa) due to the malnutrition imposed by the Ukrainian cereal blockade on the Black Sea, as observed by UNICEF48  48 https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/explosion-child-deaths-imminent-horn-africa-if-world-does-not-act-immediately-unicef   . Therefore, it will be challenging to meet SDGTs 3.1 and 3.2 (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict increased the incidence of disease, as reported by WHO (2022) , due to the destruction of medical facilities and pollutants released into the air, soil, and water (e.g., uranium, hydrogen sulfide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). It is estimated that many health concerns will increase, such as chronic infectious diseases, cancer, COVID-19, diphtheria, measles, respiratory diseases, hepatitis A and mental health (WHO, 2022 ). These concerns are particularly relevant for refugees (Murphy et al., 2022 ). As mentioned previously, shelling in Ukraine is targeted at health care facilities. For instance, on March 13, 2022, 31 attacks on healthcare institutions were documented by the World Health Organization49  49 https://www.who.int/news/item/13-03-2022-stop-attacks-on-health-care-in-ukraine   . This will reduce the country’s capacity to attend to the population and prevent potential disease outbreaks. The UN has reported that Ukrainian hospitals are on the verge of collapse and lack life-saving supplies50  50 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113902   . Also, the incidence of mental diseases provoked by the conflicts can trigger the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and drugs in the military and civil population, as observed in previous conflicts (e.g., Wasserman, 1989 ; Schiff et al., 2012 ; Berridge, 2014 ; Werb, 2018 ; Kakaje et al., 2021 ). Therefore, it is highly challenging for Ukraine to meet SDGTs 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c. The crisis created by this conflict also challenged developing countries to achieve SDG’s Targets 3.b, 3.c, and 3.d (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). In Ukraine, most of the human medical resources available are allocated to the injured from the conflicts, delaying the diagnosis and treatment of other diseases during COVID-19 (e.g., Hartman et al., 2020 ; Jones et al., 2020 ). This probably will increase the indirect effects of the conflicts on patient assistance. In the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict (Pereira et al., 2022 ), as in other conflicts (Khordagui and Al-Ajmi, 1993 ; Bruckberger et al., 2020 ), air, soil, and water pollution increases, endangering population health and increasing mortality (Leaning et al., 2000 ). This hampers SDGT 3.9 achievement in Ukraine (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The armed conflict has had disastrous effects on Ukrainian schools and universities51  51 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-education-idUSKCN0VK1BY   . Only in Kharkiv 48 schools were destroyed52  52 https://www.reuters.com/world/forty-eight-schools-destroyed-ukrainian-city-kharkiv-mayor-2022-03-11/   . It is estimated that 1,635 education institutions (schools and universities) have been damaged. The conflict obligated approximately 665,000 students and 25,000 educators to be displaced from their home institutions53  53 https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/education-impact-war-ukraine-may-2022   . Due to this situation, most of the education is given online. This will amplify the effects that COVID-19 had on education. The learning losses will continue to grow and will be substantial in Ukraine (e.g., learning loss, infrastructure destruction, children and teenager conflict traumatic disorders)54  54 https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ukraine-points-threat-education-during-war    (World Bank, 2022b ). According to UNICEF, the “Conflict in Ukraine disrupting entire generation of children ”55  55 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112272   . For the teachers and students that remained in Ukraine, the work and learning conditions have degraded56  56 https://gdc.unicef.org/resource/schools-during-armed-conflict-eastern-ukraine   . Also, several universities were affected by the conflict, and in the current conditions, did not have the opportunity to have a better higher education system57  57 https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/how-can-ukrainian-universities-be-rebuilt   . However, several Ukrainian children and teenagers are receiving education in other countries, such as Poland58  58 https://www.reuters.com/world/forty-eight-schools-destroyed-ukrainian-city-kharkiv-mayor-2022-03-11/   , Lithuania59  59 https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1648513/emotional-roller-coaster-ukrainian-students-in-lithuania-help-their-homeland-resist-russian-invasion   , Latvia60  60 https://bnn-news.com/more-than-4-000-ukrainian-refugee-children-study-at-latvian-schools-234918   , Germany61  61 https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20220401133548508   , Sweden62  62 https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/swedens-education-responses-influx-ukrainian-students   , Finland63  63 https://yle.fi/news/3-12351223   , and Norway64  64 https://en.uit.no/news/article?p_document_id=777416   . Ukrainian teachers are also being hosted in many other European institutions, which might mitigate the damages caused by the conflict. Nevertheless, it will be challenging for Ukraine to achieve SDGTs 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and 4.a (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict has been dramatic for males and females. According to the UN, on July 04, 202265  65 https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2022/07/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-4-july-2022   , there were 11,152 civilian casualties (4,889 killed – 1,862 men, 1,264 women- and 6,263 injured). Young men from Ukraine and Russia have been dragged into this conflict. Military losses are more challenging to track. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine66  66 https://www.mil.gov.ua/en/   , on July 12, approximately 37,470 Russian soldiers died in this conflict. However, this data may not be precise and must be considered carefully and with many restrictions. According to UN (2022b , 2022c) 67  67 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1117542   , in this conflict, women have a crucial role in humanitarian assistance but do not entirely participate in decision-making. It is estimated as well that this crisis will increase the previous inequalities and discrimination (e.g., care burden increase), and woman are affected by multi-sectorial and compounded aspects of this conflict (e.g., limited access to shelter, access to hygienic facilities, and healthcare, exposition to gender-based violence such as sexual and domestic violence). It has been alleged that Ukrainian girls and women were treated with extreme violence68  68 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1119832   . Evidence showed that the Ukrainian crisis might increase the risks of human trafficking for women’s sexual exploitation69  69 https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2022/4/62569be24/ukraine-crisis-creates-new-trafficking-risks.html   . The influx of refugees increases the crime rate as well. Under these conditions, achieving SDGTs 5.1 and 5.2 targets in Ukraine, Russia, surrounding countries, and the EU will be highly problematic. SDGTs 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.c will be especially challenging in Ukraine (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict has had tremendous impacts on the energy market, which spilled over to other markets (e.g., food). The effect of energy and food interaction can be described as the telecoupling effect (Liu, 2017 ). For some, this conflict is a “fossil fuel war” (Shiffer, 2022 ). This conflict changed the geopolitics of energy, increasing oil and gas prices drastically. Gas prices doubled, and crude oil prices increased by 60%. Russia is one of the world’s largest oil producers and supplies gas to Europe. After the armed conflict began, several Western countries imposed an embargo on Russian oil and gas and tried to source alternative markets (Tollefson, 2022 ; UN, 2022b ). Several EU countries tried desperately to diversify their energy sources to supply the necessities and become independent from Russian energy (European Parliament, 2022b ). However, this crisis is seen by some as an opportunity in the medium term to increase the investment in renewable70  70 https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/ukraine-war-tracking-impacts-german-energy-and-climate-policy   , 71  71 https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/the-net-zero-transition-in-the-wake-of-the-war-in-ukraine-a-detour-a-derailment-or-a-different-path    and nuclear energy72  72 https://www.energymonitor.ai/sectors/power/weekly-data-rebirth-nuclear-power-renewables   . Nevertheless, in the short term, EU countries will likely be pressured to supply the necessities and try to fulfil the energy necessities using fossil fuel sources. This could develop a “gold rush” for fossil fuels73  73 https://impakter.com/goldrush-for-fossil-fuels/   . In Ukraine, the intense shelling reduced the energy supply in several cities. At the global level, energy access was disrupted by COVID-19, and according to the World Bank, the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict will decrease the SDG 7 progress74  74 https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/energy/publication/tracking-sdg-7-the-energy-progress-report-2022   . Under these conditions, not only in Ukraine but also in other parts of the world, achieving SDGT 7.1 will be problematic (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The high number of buildings affected by bombs75  75 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/russias-war-in-ukraine-causing-36bn-of-building-damage-a-week    also limits their energy efficiency, posing important challenges to Ukraine’s achieving SDG 7.3. Also, this immediate rush for fossil fuels slows down the importance of renewable energy sources, reducing the pace of the world to achieve SDGT 7.2. Finally, this conflict is affecting international cooperation and collaboration76  76 https://theconversation.com/ukraine-invasion-threatens-international-collaboration-in-space-and-shows-how-power-structures-are-changing-podcast-181997   , 77  77 https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/russia%E2%80%99s-war-against-ukraine-where-do-we-stand-and-what-can-future-bring_en   , 78  78 https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/war-in-ukraine   , threatening the global implementation of SDGT 7.a (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). Due to bombing and shelling, several Ukrainian cities are being transformed into rubble, and the living conditions are precarious79  79 https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/03/situation-ukraine   . They face a tremendous shortage of basic products (e.g., food, water, or medicine)80  80 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1114232   . The civil infrastructure is heavily damaged (United Nations Human Rights, 2022 ). Reports show that the bombing in residential urban is frequent81  81 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1121592   . This will present several challenges for Ukraine to achieve SDG Targets 11.1, 11.2, 11.7, and 11.b (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). Also, the number of people that have fled from cities is enormous. It is impossible to quantify how many are displaced from urban areas, but evaluating the car traffic observed in the cities in the first days of the conflict outskirts, there might be many. It is not sustainable to live in urban areas in such conditions. This will limit Ukraine’s sustainable urban development and SDGT 11.3 (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). There is also evidence of cultural heritage destruction due to shelling. According to UNESCO82  82 https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/damaged-cultural-sites-ukraine-verified-unesco?hub=66116   , 161 cultural heritage sites have been destroyed. This will diminish Ukraine’s capacity to fulfil SDGT 11.4 (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). Likewise, infrastructure destruction could increase vulnerability to natural disasters, but there has been no evidence of this to date. However, the exposure to cold will increase as winter approaches, which is harsh in Ukraine. So far, several power plants have been shelled83  83 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-22/ukraine-power-plant-damaged-during-two-days-of-shelling   , affecting energy production for heating. The armed conflict has also affected Ukraine’s energy suppliers84  84 https://neweasterneurope.eu/2022/05/03/the-ukrainian-electric-power-industry-on-the-front-line-challenges-and-opportunities-ahead/   . Disruptions to energy supplies are affecting other countries dependent on Russian sources, especially when it is difficult to find alternative sources (and the risk that Russia will close the energy supply)85  85 https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-likely-completely-cut-off-europe-gas-supply-french-minister-2022-7   . This challenges Ukraine, Russia, and surrounding countries to achieve SDGT 11.5. (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). Finally, it is well known that the conflict is increasing the pollution levels in cities due to shelling (Pereira et al., 2022 ) and leaving a “toxic environmental legacy” in urban areas86  86 https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-warns-toxic-environmental-legacy-ukraine-region   , and decreasing the capacity for Ukraine and Russia to achieve SDGT 11.6 (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict increases the level of violence, and in the, there areas there is some evidence of child sexual abuse, death, and injury, as reported by UNICEF87  87 https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/war-ukraine-pose-immediate-threat-children   , 88  88 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1119832   . Also, there is a high threat that children crossing from Ukraine can be exposed to human trafficking and exploitation89  89 https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/children-fleeing-war-ukraine-heightened-risk-trafficking-and-exploitation   . This hampers the SDGTs 16.1 and 16.2 achievements in Ukraine, Russia, and surrounding countries (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). Also, according to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the armed conflict is threatening the Rule of Law in the country, affecting the development of Ukraine as a democratic country90  90 https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/rule-law-and-human-rights   . This imposes a fundamental challenge for achieving SDGT 16.3 (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). There are also concerns regarding the smuggling of NATO weapons91  91 https://www.ft.com/content/bce78c78-b899-4dd2-b3a0-69d789b8aee8?fbclid=IwAR0s49jTFz937HrCY0ONUORE1tFH0PrM-1YCUEy6bOTZ8xGwciCAhoJB6BM   . Recently the EU created a hub in Moldova to prevent illegal arms trafficking92  92 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_4462?fbclid=IwAR1j3loQQbmxcnjcLXoHqQtDc41NKMCsH5F6e3H4CtETYghTCIMGE3q3KCI   . Although this initiative is essential, there is a risk of illicit arms trafficking in Ukraine, Russia, and surrounding countries undermining SDGTs 16.4 and 16.5 (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The conflict affects a country’s normal functioning, and Ukraine and Russia are no exception. For instance, according to Transparency.Org93  93 https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021   , among 180 countries, Ukraine ranked 122 and Russia 136 on the 2021 Corruption Perception index. The conflict can increase the corruption in these countries as they attempt to find gaps to overcome the sanctions imposed by Western countries94  94 https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/06/ukraine-war-russian-sanctions-anticorruption/   . In the post-conflict reconstruction phase, there will be concerns regarding the corruption in Ukraine95  95 https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/23/ukraine-aid-corruption-reconstruction/   . This will challenge achieving SDGT 16.6 in Ukraine and Russia (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). The conflict affected the governance reforms conducted in Ukraine since 2014 and delayed SDGT 16.7 (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). However, this will also represent an opportunity to reset and establish new and modern governance practices based on international standards91 . The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict affected fundamental rights. Measures and laws enacted during the war limited the media and some basic rights, such as freedom of opinion96  96 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113762   , stated in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights97  97 https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights?fbclid=IwAR0s49jTFz937HrCY0ONUORE1tFH0PrM-1YCUEy6bOTZ8xGwciCAhoJB6BM   . This will affect the capacity to fulfil SDGT 16.10 (Fig. 2 ; Table S2). Finally, there has been an increase in crime, which has resulted in international cooperation in investigating these crimes98  98 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_22_4509   , 99  99 https://www.icc-cpi.int/ukraine   . This weakens the countries’ capacity to achieve SDGT 16.a (Fig. 2 ; Table S2).  4 Economic SDGs and partnership for the goals The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict provoked an economic recession, damaged the global economy, and frustrated the post-COVID recovery (World Bank, 2022a ). According to the World Bank100  100 https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/04/10/russian-invasion-to-shrink-ukraine-economy-by-45-percent-this-year   , the Russian economy is predicted to contract by 11.2% in 2022. The situation is more difficult in Ukraine, where the economy is forecast to contract by 45.1%. The impact is not limited to these countries. It is expected to provoke a “global ripple” and erodes global economic prospects, reducing market confidence, financial flows, commodity markets, and trade. For instance, the prices for the products that Ukraine and Russia provided to the global market (e.g., fertilizers, metals, energy, wheat) have increased substantially. The financial markets became volatile due to these uncertainties. Also, rising inflation has affected the global economy. For instance, the strong economic ties with Russia (South Caucasus), Europe, and Central Asia will be severely affected. If Russia reduces or cuts the oil and gas exports to Europe, the prices of these commodities will increase even higher (Guenette et al., 2022 ). In the case of a more prolonged Russian supply disruption of 12 months or more, it is estimated that for the EU as a whole, there will be a 3% GDP loss in 2023 (European Parliament, 2022c ). Other claims are that this reduction could reach 4%101  101 https://www.coface.com/News-Publications/News/Economic-consequences-of-the-Russia-Ukraine-conflict-Stagflation-ahead   . In Russia, an 11% GDP reduction is expected in 2022 – the largest since the Soviet Union collapse102  102 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/impact-sanctions-russian-economy/   . At a global level, GDP will likely decrease by 1% (Ruta, 2022 ). For instance, Sri Lanka has recently declared bankruptcy103  103 https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sri-lanka-default-debt-no-money-fuel-minister-says-2022-05-18/   , 104  104 https://www.businessinsider.com/sri-lanka-says-bankrupt-financial-crisis-ravages-country-debts-default-2022-7   . The economic impact of the Russian-Ukraine armed conflict is disastrous. Due to COVID-19, 60% of the workers have reduced incomes. The situation will now worsen (UN, 2022a ), substantially reducing the economic growth in Ukraine, Russia, surrounding countries, and EU countries and limiting the SDGT 8.1 achievements (Fig. 3  ; Table S2). The sanctions imposed on Russia are affecting the economy and high-tech industry105  105 https://www.ft.com/content/caf2cd3c-1f42-4e4a-b24b-c0ed803a6245   . There was a boycott by thousands of international companies doing business in Russia, affecting the Russian population106  106 https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/sanctions-and-costs-russia-s-war-ukraine   . In Ukraine, the destruction of infrastructure and population migration is affecting economic productivity due to reduced innovation and technology upgrades. This creates enormous challenges for Ukraine and Russia in achieving SDGT 8.2 (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). The outbreak of this armed conflict has had a massive impact on the economy and reduced European labour market recovery (Prohorovs, 2022 ). Unemployment has increased substantially. For instance, approximately five million jobs in Ukraine have been lost107  107 https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_844625/lang–en/index.htm   . The intensive companies flee increased the unemployment in Russia108  108 https://www.reuters.com/business/russian-workers-face-new-reality-ukraine-war-sanctions-sap-job-prospects-2022-04-13/   . It is expected that in Russia, about two million jobs will be lost109  109 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1120502   . In several countries, such as Czechia, Poland, and Lithuania, many companies (including some Russian banks) have closed due to production costs or abandoned the European market110  110 https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/publications/article/2022/first-impacts-of-the-ukrainian-crisis-on-employment-in-the-eu   . Global markets’ increasing unemployment and uncertainty will challenge achieving SDGTs 8.3, 8.5, and 8.6 (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). The conflict has created an energy crisis, and as noted above, there is a rush by European countries to find alternative sources of energy111  111 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-response-ukraine-invasion/impact-of-russia-s-invasion-of-ukraine-on-the-markets-eu-response/   . On the one hand, this could have some positive aspects as the accelerated investment in renewables and reduction of energy sector impacts the environment112  112 https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/never-safe-without-energy-independence-eu-urged-to-back-renewables-led-recovery-for-ukraine/2-1-1252024   . On the other hand, with the urgency to produce enough energy for households, energy alternatives, such as coal, are being reactivated113  113 https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/09/why-the-war-in-ukraine-is-driving-up-europes-use-of-coal-and-its-price   . This will affect the short-term achievement of SDGT 8.4 in Ukraine and surrounding/developing countries (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). The Russian-Ukraine armed conflict produced many refugees that fled to nearby countries and has increased the risk of human trafficking114  114 https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-key-evidence-risks-trafficking-persons-and-smuggling-migrants    and forced labor. There is a risk of modern slavery increase115  115 https://www.fm-magazine.com/news/2022/jun/the-war-ukraine-raises-risk-modern-slavery.html   . The conflict decreases labour conditions not only on the frontline but also in civil infrastructure (e.g., malls) since Russian forces are shelling several malls116  116 https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-missiles-hit-crowded-shopping-mall-central-ukraine-zelenskiy-2022-06-27/   , 117  117 https://www.npr.org/2022/06/28/1108119523/death-toll-rises-from-russian-strike-on-shopping-mall-in-ukraine   . Also, in Russia, the increasing unemployment mainly affects migrant workers, drastically reducing their income118  118 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1120502   . Looking at these two examples, the conflict poses significant challenges to achieving SDGTs 8.7 and 8.8 in Ukraine, Russia, and surrounding and EU countries (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). One of the sectors most affected by the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict is tourism (WNTO, 2022 ). In 2020, both countries represented 3% of global spending on tourism. The expenditures by both countries are expected to decrease, affecting several countries, mainly those located in Central Asia and the Caucasus. In 2019 Ukraine’s spending on travel was US$ 8.5 billion, and Russia spent US$ 36 billion. Several other countries have substantially reduced the number of flights, including Finland, Moldova, Latvia, Sweden, Czechia, and Slovenia. Recently several European countries banned or are planning to ban tourist visas (e.g., Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Czech Republic), and there are pressures to extend this visa ban in all EU countries119  119 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-12/russia-visa-ban-in-eu-wins-key-backing-from-czech-presidency   . Some countries limit only the visit of Russian nationals to military installations (e.g., France)120  120 https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2022/08/09/france-loosens-restriction-on-russian-nationals-after-chateau-turns-away-visitors_5993002_7.html   , while others are not aligned the idea of visa bans to Russia (e.g., Germany)121  121 https://euobserver.com/ukraine/155782   . Some countries will be affected more than others by travel restrictions. However, the impact is expected to be global. Several other aspects can affect this, such as high inflation and fuel prices, drop-in consumer confidence, and air restrictions imposed on Russia (Pandey and Kumar, 2022 ; Ruta, 2022 )122  122 https://www.unwto.org/impact-russian-offensive-in-ukraine-on-tourism   . This scenario would challenge achieving SDGT 8.9 on the global scale (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). Financial stability has been strongly affected by the Russian-Ukraine armed conflict impacting all economic activity123  123 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ecb.pr220525~fa1be4764d.en.html   . For instance, several Russian banks have been removed from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), inhibiting them from international bank transfers and accessing international markets. This sanction disconnected Russia from the global market124  124 https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/swift-primer-west-moves-freeze-russia-out-international-payments-2022-02-26/   . Also, Russia defaulted on its foreign debt on June 27, 2022. Despite the uncertainty on long-term impacts, the country will be challenged to maintain investors and attract new ones because of the increased credit risk. The impact of this default is not limited to Russia, as other European will also be exposed125  125 https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/russian-debt-default-russia-global-financial-markets   , 126  126 https://www.agcs.allianz.com/news-and-insights/expert-risk-articles/ukraine-invasion-impacts-financial-services.html   . This cascade of events will pose a significant challenge to strengthening domestic financial institutions and ensuring the stability of the banking system, undermining the SDGT 8.10 achievement in Ukraine127  127 https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/europe-at-war-six-charts-to-know-in-financial-markets/   , Russia, and many other countries with ties to Russia’s financial system128  128 https://www.agcs.allianz.com/news-and-insights/expert-risk-articles/ukraine-invasion-impacts-financial-services.html    (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). The destruction created by the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict has drastically downgraded human well-being. This situation will become even more problematic when colder conditions return later this year in Ukraine. Also, the increasing inflation and house prices will pose challenges for the poorest seeking affordable homes with good living conditions. A dramatic cycle has already begun. The rise in fuel and fertilizer costs has reduced farm yields and increased food costs. This has reduced household incomes and living standards and increased poverty and social instability. When the prices increase rapidly, there is pressure to raise the interest rates, which increases borrowing costs for developing countries and, ultimately, their food and energy costs (UN, 2022a ). This situation will negatively impact wellbeing and, therefore, achievement of SDGT 9.1 globally (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). As mentioned above, this conflict poses severe difficulties to industries and employment, negatively affecting SDGT 9.2. achievement in Ukraine, Russia, surrounding countries, the EU, developing countries, and other global nations (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). Also, although the impact on some banks is contained, according to European Investment Bank (2022) , access to credit and financing in several European countries (Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Europe) could be limited. According to OECD (2022) , the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict is negatively impacting financial markets by a)“growing market fragilities and concerns over market integrity in alternative finance markets ”; b) “rising refinancing risk of emerging market economies (EMEs) ”; c) “elevated debt of corporates combined with deteriorating credit quality ”; d) “elevated sovereign debt levels and high refinancing needs ” and e) “rising risk for banks from credit quality deterioration and the impact of sanctions ”.  This will decrease financial services and affordable credit, challenging SDGTs 9.3, 9.5, 9.6, 9.a, and 9.b at the world level. Finally, as mentioned above, due to sanctions imposed on Russia and the rising oil and gas prices and to meet the energy demand, several countries reactivated coal power plants129  129 https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/07/21/heres-how-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-is-fueling-a-comeback-for-coal/   . This will also limit the SDGT 9.4 achievements in the short term at the world level (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). One of the most severe aspects of the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict is the increase in global inequality. Price increases and global economic disruption increase the debt in Latin American and Caribbean countries130  130 https://reliefweb.int/report/ecuador/ukraine-conflict-causes-soaring-debt-and-increased-poverty-and-inequality-across   . According to the World Bank (2022c) , the most immediate impacts of the conflict are in the emergent market developing economies through the trade of commodities (e.g., oil and gas). This will reduce the growth of the poorest countries and the capacity to have income growth, with implications for SDGTs 10.1 and 10.3 (Fig. 3 ). The conflict is also increasing the inequalities and conflicts related to gender131  131 https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/gender-health-and-war-ukraine    (European Parliament, 2022d ), race (Cenat et al., 2022 ), ethnic minorities132  132 https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/03/ukraine-un-expert-says-war-against-multi-ethnic-population-must-stop-calls    in Ukraine, Russia133  133 https://www.coe.int/en/web/minorities/-/advisory-committee-deplores-russia-s-usage-of-minority-rights-as-a-pretext-for-invading-ukraine-concerned-about-the-war-deepening-mistrust-in-intereth   , Moldova134  134 https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/05/25/moldova-romani-refugees-ukraine-face-segregation    and Poland135  135 https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220228-pushed-back-because-we-re-black-africans-stranded-at-ukraine-poland-border   . This will pose difficulties in achieving SDGT 10.2 (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). Several reports confirmed the forced migration of Ukrainian citizens to Russia from the areas occupied by the Russian army136  136 https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/forced-displacement-ukraine-notes-humanitarian-protection-and-durable-solutions   . Some of the migration to surrounding countries was undertaken in precarious conditions. For instance, countries such as Moldova (one of the poorest countries in Europe) cannot receive large influxes of migrants137  137 https://www.npr.org/2022/03/18/1087582204/refugee-assistance-from-one-of-europes-poorest-countries   , imposing restrictions on SDGT 10.7 in Ukraine, Russia, and surrounding countries. Finally, the economic crisis will reduce financial flows and investment and foreign investment, slowing the SDGT 10.b achievement globally (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). The armed conflict decreases the confidence in having Russia as an economic partner. To face increasing oil and gas prices creates a demand to increase the extraction of these commodities138  138 https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-july-2022   . However, some have claimed that it is impossible to replace Russian oil139  139 https://www.energyconnects.com/news/oil-and-gas/2022/april/opec-warns-eu-it-s-impossible-to-replace-russian-oil/   . This will reduce the sustainability in exploiting and managing natural resources, limiting SDGT 12.2 achievement at a world level. Another impact of the conflict is the increase in air, soil, and water pollution and the degradation of human health (Pereira et al., 2022 ), threatening SDGT 12.4 achievement in Ukraine, Russia, and surrounding countries. However, the expected economic slowdown in parts of the world will decrease these pollutants. Nevertheless, more time is needed to confirm this thought (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). Also, the economic crisis will reduce the establishment of sustainable practices, as observed in previous research (e.g., Anbumozhi and Bauer, 2010 ). This will affect SDGT 12.6 achievement globally. As mentioned above, there has been an increase in waste production in areas affected by shelling in Ukraine140  140 https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/ukraine-war-environmental-impact/    and Russia141  141 https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/3/explosions-reported-in-the-russian-city-of-belgorod-3-dead   , threatening the achievement of SDGT 12.5 (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). The global economic crisis created by the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict is expected to reduce the finances of world nations142  142 https://unctad.org/news/ukraine-war-risks-further-cuts-development-finance    and the support for developing countries (Ruta, 2022 ), affecting the achievement of SDGTs 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5, 17.6, and 17.19. (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). Also, the conflict affects trading systems (e.g., sanctions and their multiple effects). It has substantially disrupted macroeconomic stability, as highlighted by many international institutions such as the EU143  143 https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/russia%E2%80%99s-invasion-ukraine-puts-global-economy-risk_en   , The International Monetary Fund144  144 https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/03/the-long-lasting-economic-shock-of-war   , and World Bank (Guénette et al., 2022 ). This will slow the pace of achieving SDGTs 17.9, 17.10, and 17.13 (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). The UN demands the immediate cessation of the conflict in Ukraine145  145 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152   . The Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict affects policy establishment and implementation related to sustainable development in Ukraine. This interferes with SDGT 17.15 and 17 achievements (Fig. 3 ; Table S2). The conflict has increased some world partnerships (e.g., NATO countries and the engagement of other members such as Finland and Sweden146  146 https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_197763.htm   ), affecting SDGTs 17.16 and 17.17 (Fig. 3 ; Table S2).  5 Final remarks With the establishment of the UN SDGs, we want to fight for a better, more prosperous world for all, where we can live with differences. For many countries, COVID-19 slowed the pace of achieving the established targets by 2030. Furthermore, the world was already struggling before COVID-19. However, political disputes and armed conflicts constrain international coordination and cooperation for sustainable development (Zhao et al., 2022 ). Over the past several decades, the armed conflicts/wars in Libya, Iraq, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and other countries have significantly impacted regional and global development. With this conflict’s emergence, several nations’ ability to achieve SDGs by 2030 can become unattainable. The conflict slowed the post-COVID-19 recovery and negatively impacted regional and Global SDG achievement. Many points in the article are based on the news reports and have uncertainties, which means the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict impact on SDGs are uncertain. However, there are direct effects that we have to live with now and, maybe, years into the future. Peace is the base of sustainable development. No peace, no SDGs for 2030 and the future. We need peace for the world’s future.   Supplementary materials Supplementary material associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at doi:10.1016/j.geosus.2022.09.003 .
