                  Pakistan is in a terrifying and devastating energy crisis. Recently, the prediction for energy consumption has intensified compared to its production capacity, which is problematic for Pakistan's social and economic stability. Hence, it is vital to examine the link between power consumption, power prices, urban transition, other electricity use, and economic expansion from 1970 to 2018 in Pakistan. For analysis, the second-generation econometric technique of Lee and Strazicich (2013), novel Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (AARDL), and Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) is useful to detect the long-medium and short-run association among the variables. The results show that power consumption stimulates economic expansion in the short and long-run, though the rise in power prices declines economic activity in the short and long-run. Also, urban transition and other electricity use are a substantial positive and negative impact on economic expansion in the short and long-run. The outcome suggests that efficient energy supply, low-cost power prices, proper urban transition management, and other energy use could be useful for policymakers to achieve SDGs 7 and 11 in Pakistan.

They found empirically relevant and constructive interactions between capital and labor on EG while bi-directional causality exists. Similarly [33], found a one-way causal association between power use and financial growth, inferring that electricity constraints financial development. In addition [6], used Johansen co-integration and the VECM to consider the rapport between energy demand, electricity costs, and GDP for various sectors in Pakistan. The findings revealed a long-term link between manufacturing, household, and aggregate. The industrial and agricultural sectors discovered a long-term association with the price feedback effect on electricity use besides short-term causality found in all fields except aggregate. Furthermore [34], exercised data from 1973 to 2016 to assess the magnitude of the direct rebound influence of household energy usage in Pakistan. The ECM and econometric co-integration methodology exercised. According to the results, the direct recovery effect is 69.5% in the long term and 42.9% in the short run. EC has shown that rising energy use causes environmental change [35]. used the ARDL model to study the influence of public-private partnership energy infrastructure on Pakistan's long-term sustainable development [36]. explored the effects of remittances, natural resources, technological innovation, and EG in Pakistan by regulating energy use and urbanization. Their findings revealed that the factors included in the research are critical for Pakistan's long-term strategies [18]. studied the factors influencing EG in Pakistan from 1972 to 2018. The dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) simulations approach and frequency-domain causality (FDC) are used to examine positive and negative changes in energy consumption, industrial growth, urbanization, and carbon emissions on EG in Pakistan over the long-, medium-, and short-run. The empirical research demonstrated that EC and industrial value-added influenced EG in the short and long term [37]. examined the causal relationship between Pakistan's GDP and EC using a Trivariate approach that included capital formation from 1990 to 2018. To uncover long and short run relationships among specified variables, the Johansen co-integration test and Vector Auto Regression with Error Correction (VAR/VEC) techniques are used. In addition, impulse response and variance decomposition strategies are utilized to validate the results. In the short run, the result supports the presence of a two-way causal relationship that implies Pakistan's energy industry and GDP production are interdependent [38]. assessed Pakistan's electricity consumption from 1989 to 2018 using the share of EC, economic progress, power intensity and population. Furthermore, a suitable decoupling approach is used to assess the correlation between associated variables and sustainable development. The sectoral and national levels investigated. The outcomes specified that the impact of the structural economic market is the primary driving force for rising total EC in Pakistan, with positive energy frequency variation.   item

Handling Editor: Mark Howells Pakistan is in a terrifying and devastating energy crisis. Recently, the prediction for energy consumption has intensified compared to its production capacity, which is problematic for Pakistan's social and economic stability. Hence, it is vital to examine the link between power consumption, power prices, urban transition, other electricity use, and economic expansion from 1970 to 2018 in Pakistan. For analysis, the second-generation econometric technique of Lee and Strazicich (2013), novel Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (AARDL), and Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) is useful to detect the long-medium and short-run association among the variables. The results show that power consumption stimulates economic expansion in the short and long-run, though the rise in power prices declines economic activity in the short and long-run. Also, urban transition and other electricity use are a substantial positive and negative impact on economic expansion in the short and long-run. The outcome suggests that efficient energy supply, low-cost power prices, proper urban transition management, and other energy use could be useful for policymakers to achieve SDGs 7 and 11 in Pakistan.   Keywords Power consumption  Power prices  Urban transition  Economic expansion  AARDL   Data availability Data will be made available on request.   1 Introduction Energy is the main contributor to improving economic activity. Therefore, it is an ever-increasingly important factor in every economy. Energy consumption (EC) multiplies the manufacturing process, expanding economic growth (EG). Pakistan's power shortages result from inadequate planning and incompetence in the energy market. The challenge is not limited to a lack of electricity; weak consumer equipment, insufficient energy mix, and higher generation & distribution failures are major contributors [1 ]. Therefore, the study analyzes the factors to bridge the gap and provide concrete policy implications for sustainable growth on a massive scale. Following SDGs-7 (Inexpensive and Clean Energy ) by 2030, build infrastructure and improve technologies to ensure that all developing nations, particularly least developed nations, tiny island emerging states, and land-locked developing nations, have access to efficient and sustainable energy amenities [2 ]. These are all age-old issues and highly concerned topics in the economic literature in recent times. An underdeveloped electricity network hampers Pakistan's economy. It is a widespread problem that causes power outages/load-shedding, normally expended to satisfy the economy's intensified need for power. Since many production and distribution processes require electricity as a fundamental supply for better business development, also it is essential to the modern economy [3 ]. Electricity demand dynamics for the long term are essential for the country's energy planning and growth. Long-term energy demand forecasting is important for underdeveloped and developing economies' energy infrastructure expansion plans [4 ]. As one of the most effective secondary energies, electric power is both stable and easy to transmit, and It is vital to the growth of the country's economy and the improvement of a person's living standards [5 ]. 1.1 Urban transition in Pakistan According to SDG-11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities ), more than half of the world's population resides in metropolises. By 2050, two-thirds of the world's population, 6.5 billion people, will be urban. Sustainable development cannot be accomplished without primarily changing the way of designing and managing urban residences [2 ]. In South Asia, the rate of urbanization in Pakistan is the fastest. As per Population Census in 2017, 36.4% of the population resides in cities. According to the United Nations Population Division, by 2025, almost half of the population will live in metropolises. Urbanization is widely deemed economic development, especially in developing nations where it often happens in correlation. More than 80% of the world's gross domestic product (GDP) is anticipated from cities worldwide. More populated areas mean higher income and job opportunities; towns and metropolises are productive hubs. Urbanization has significant implications for technical and economic expansion. Pakistan's aggregate cities represent 55% of the GDP [6 ]. According to a report by Business Recorder, Pakistan generates 95% of its federal tax receipts from 10 main towns, while the three biggest cities produce 86% of its total federal tax revenue, namely Karachi generating 55%, Islamabad, 16%, and Lahore 15%. The ten main cities of Pakistan have higher than average per capita income. Poverty in towns is normally lower (i.e., multidimensional urban poverty is one-sixth of rural poverty) [7 ]. A new analysis has shown that the association between growth and urbanization is not inevitable. Urbanization is without any growth, employment, and productivity in many developing countries. The benefits of urbanization are only reinforced by good public policy [8 ]. Conversely, unplanned and uncontrolled urbanization led to urban slums, environmental degradation, uncertainty, and inequalities; Pakistan also encountered urban issues [2 ]. According to economic theory, EG and socioeconomic modernization drive urbanization [9 ]. inferred that urbanization entails moving rural labor from the agrarian to the manufacturing sectors, largely in cities. Urbanization is occurring at an unprecedented rate and size in developed states. It took roughly 150 years for Europe's urbanization rate to spread from 10% to 50%; in most developed Asian countries, the same transition happens one-third of the time. Overall, the causality analysis can yield four results: (i) one-way causality running from EC to GDP or (ii) GDP to EC, (iii) bi-directional causality, and (iv) the so-called ‘Neutrality Hypothesis,’ implying that there is no causal connection in either direction. Numerous scholars, from a global viewpoint, focused causal link between EC and EG in many states and reported two contrary arguments. Some consider energy significant for economic progress [10–12 ], while others believe electricity is detrimental to economic growth [13 ,14 ]. However, Pakistan focused on different aspects, such as [15 ] scrutinizing Pakistan's textile industry and the energy crisis. Their findings confirmed that the lack of electricity supply has a detrimental influence on the reduction of exports [16 ]. stated that Pakistan is facing severe energy shortage problems, which substantially negatively affect Pakistan's overall EG unless this critical problem resolves. A strong relationship between GDP and power consumption revealed by Ref. [17 ] reported economic progress and energy shortage caused by a lack of electricity supply, Pakistan seems unable to meet the required economic growth. Recently, many studies attempted on energy crisis issues in Pakistan, such as [6 ], examined the EC factors, including EP, GDP, UPG, and OEC at the sectoral level in Pakistan. Also [18 ], scrutinized energy consumption, industrial growth, urbanization, and carbon emissions on economic growth. Whereas [19 ] aimed to study electricity consumption, electricity prices, economic expansion, industrialization, and urbanization. These researches used significant energy economic factors, methods in specific sectors and country level. These studies proposed that the government should develop economic policies that would push Pakistan to deal with the challenges identified by its dependence on imported fossil fuels and make better use of its natural resources. However, Pakistan is in the grip of an extreme energy crisis, with far-reaching consequences for both the country's faltering economy and dangerous humanitarian situation. While power usage has grown more than 16-fold in the course of the last four decades and is predicted to maintain increasing swiftly later on [6 ]. Given the drawback still the energy issue is a major concern for policy makers in Pakistan. Hence, it is worthy to re-examine the arguments that supported the previously prevalent perspective or that support the new vision. With this motivation, the study explores the factors that help postulate a way forward to make a firm economic policy. Therefore, the study contributes to modern energy-economic literature in several ways: First , this research embraces diverse factors that bridge the gap by re-investigating power consumption, power prices, urban transition, other electricity use, and economic expansion in Pakistan from 1970 to 2018. Second , this research aims to pinpoint factors that might help policymakers establish long-term economic policies. Third , the majority of research exercised the ARDL method developed by Ref. [20 ]; however, a few studies used techniques that account for structural breaks, and their results directly contradicted one another. Given this backdrop [21 ,22 ], re-examined the ARDL technique and corroborated the contradicting assumptions of [20 ]. In other words, the trustworthiness of the findings of these investigations is dubious. As a result [22 ], proposed a novel Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) technique that will be applied in this investigation. The novel ARDL simulations can assess the effect of positive and negative fluctuations in explanatory factors on the dependent variable. Also, Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) confirms the short-medium and long-run association among the variables. From this point forward, the paper employs the most useful and relevant econometric methods. Finally , the study provides new insights in a useful manner by comparing past research findings to assist Pakistani policymakers and might be a blueprint for other nations in developing concrete plans to achieve SDGs 7 and 11. The remainder of the study is as follows: Section  (2): A brief survey of the literature; Section  (3): The materials and procedures used to construct the empirical framework. Section  (4): Results and discussion of empirical evidence. Section  (5): Concluding and discussing the policy ramifications.   2 Brief literature review The association between energy and EG is empirically studied in many studies stretching back to the last decades of the twentieth century in the energy economics literature. Many researchers have attempted to evaluate various factors, such as EC, NRE, and EG. The theoretical and methodological research evaluation is essential to understand the importance of energy in long-term economic progress. Primarily [23 ] explored the EC and EG for the first time in the United States between 1947 and 1974 and revealed a connection between PC and economic development. However, researchers cannot agree on the importance of EC to EG. Many earlier studies from developed countries that revealed energy impacts on EG have inconsistent findings [11 ,24 ]. However, many other countries, such as Poland [25 ], investigated the relationship amid EC and EG. The input by total power generation, EG, and employment in dual cycles provide comparatively more robust support to arguments. The evidence suggested that the causal dependencies structure between factors relatively stable and not completely disrupted during the 2008 financial crisis. In the modern era [26 ], inspected the link between power use and GDP growth. The analysis concentrated on a few crucial issues, and the evidence revealed promising interactions between the variables. In Ghana, the causality direction in GDP examined by Ref. [27 ]. The Cobb-Douglas model applied from 1970 to 2014. The study showed a long-term association between money, labor, and EC. In contrast, the Granger causality runs between GDP and EC, while VECM suggested the long-run correlation and the highest error correction level. Jordan [28 ] explored urbanization, population, EP, EG, water and structure economy. The inference showed that manufacturing, urbanization, EG, and combined water positively impact energy use. The causal effect of various sources of energy usage and EG is identified in econometric energy discourse. China [29 ] explored the link between EG, PC, and urbanization between 2000 and 2017. Following the initial difference, the three indicators were stationary and cointegrated. The Granger causation between these three variables is heterogeneous throughout China's east, center, and west economic areas. Long-run Granger causality was identified in the eastern area, similar to the national level. In contrast, there is a unidirectional long-run causal link between EG and electricity consumption in China's central area, but there is a bidirectional long-run causal correlation between economic activity and electricity usage in the western region. For Bangladesh [30 ], used the NARDL model to analyses the asymmetric effects of EC on EG in Bangladesh using yearly data from 1971 to 2014. Subsequently validating the long-run asymmetric cointegration between the series, the long-run finding reveals that EG in Bangladesh reacts asymmetrically to EC. The long-run outcome also shows that negative shocks in PC outweigh positive shocks in terms of hurting Bangladesh's economic development. Sub-Saharan African nations [31 ] scrutinized the link between EG and EC between 1971 and 2017. They utilized System GMM approaches to overcome endogeneity difficulties in the data generation procedure. They also investigated whether the effect of electricity usage fluctuates depending on energy intensity, using an advanced dynamic panel threshold regression model to determine the degree of the threshold level of energy intensity and the perspective of threshold asymmetry of EC on EG. The findings revealed a substantial positive association between EC-EG and a threshold energy intensity of 0.48%. Globally, many countries' outcomes showed that power is related to developed nations' economies obtained disparate results, explaining different hypotheses. Pakistan's perspective [32 ] examined the complex relationship between EC and EG. They found empirically relevant and constructive interactions between capital and labor on EG while bi-directional causality exists. Similarly [33 ], found a one-way causal association between power use and financial growth, inferring that electricity constraints financial development. In addition [6 ], used Johansen co-integration and the VECM to consider the rapport between energy demand, electricity costs, and GDP for various sectors in Pakistan. The findings revealed a long-term link between manufacturing, household, and aggregate. The industrial and agricultural sectors discovered a long-term association with the price feedback effect on electricity use besides short-term causality found in all fields except aggregate. Furthermore [34 ], exercised data from 1973 to 2016 to assess the magnitude of the direct rebound influence of household energy usage in Pakistan. The ECM and econometric co-integration methodology exercised. According to the results, the direct recovery effect is 69.5% in the long term and 42.9% in the short run. EC has shown that rising energy use causes environmental change [35 ]. used the ARDL model to study the influence of public-private partnership energy infrastructure on Pakistan's long-term sustainable development [36 ]. explored the effects of remittances, natural resources, technological innovation, and EG in Pakistan by regulating energy use and urbanization. Their findings revealed that the factors included in the research are critical for Pakistan's long-term strategies [18 ]. studied the factors influencing EG in Pakistan from 1972 to 2018. The dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) simulations approach and frequency-domain causality (FDC) are used to examine positive and negative changes in energy consumption, industrial growth, urbanization, and carbon emissions on EG in Pakistan over the long-, medium-, and short-run. The empirical research demonstrated that EC and industrial value-added influenced EG in the short and long term [37 ]. examined the causal relationship between Pakistan's GDP and EC using a Trivariate approach that included capital formation from 1990 to 2018. To uncover long and short run relationships among specified variables, the Johansen co-integration test and Vector Auto Regression with Error Correction (VAR/VEC) techniques are used. In addition, impulse response and variance decomposition strategies are utilized to validate the results. In the short run, the result supports the presence of a two-way causal relationship that implies Pakistan's energy industry and GDP production are interdependent [38 ]. assessed Pakistan's electricity consumption from 1989 to 2018 using the share of EC , economic progress, power intensity and population. Furthermore, a suitable decoupling approach is used to assess the correlation between associated variables and sustainable development. The sectoral and national levels investigated. The outcomes specified that the impact of the structural economic market is the primary driving force for rising total EC in Pakistan, with positive energy frequency variation. Following a literature review that included a study of various countries, it is possible to conclude that energy sources influence global economic development. EG can differ from country to country, depending on the circumstances. Furthermore, we need more studies on various energies and their EG nexus while finding causality less than other national and regional factions. This research looks at the relationship between PC, power prices, urban transition, other electricity use, and economic expansion in Pakistan. This study could be a meaningful effort to integrate into Pakistan's economic energy literature. Appendix Fig. A1  depicts the data average, maximum and minimum values in graphical form.  3 Materials and method 3.1 Data sources This study employs secondary time-series data from 1970 to 2018, presented in Table 1  . The PC is measured in Gigawatt-hour (GWh), which represents the total number of units consumed each year. Energy in Pakistan has become a public venture; the PP are cross-subsidizing in sectors rather than dictated by demand. The study chose a mean price of power followed by Ref. [39 ]. UT is the proxy of urban population growth, economic expansion is the proxy for the gross domestic product (GDP), and other electricity use is the proxy of Bulk Supply, IPPs & Others [6 ]. The government is also contemplating enabling independent power producers (IPPs) to sell their energy directly to ‘bulk customers' based on the amount of efficiency and ‘legal and financial comfort’. Section 3  of the Regulation of Generation, Transmission, and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997, created the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) to solely control the supply of electric power services in Pakistan. 3.1.1 Variable selection and conception Most studies identified electricity as a critical predictor in boosting GDP [18 ,28 ,43 ]; they discovered that when a country's economic status improves, so does PC; henceforth, an upsurge in PC ascends EE α i 1  = ∂ E E  i t   ∂ P C  i t    > 0   . However, power prices are the most important element influencing economic activity since low PP encourage industrial and manufacturing progress at a low cost, attracting international markets and resulting in stronger economic expansion α i 2  = ∂ E E  i t   ∂ P P  i t    < 0   . Because urban people will live in big cities and work mostly in factories, service firms, and so on, the urban transition will boost economic activity α i 3  = ∂ E E  i t   ∂ U T  i t    > 0   . Notably, other electricity use is a bulk quantity supply used for street lights and other purposes. It has both positive and negative aspects, such as if it is used to help industries manage demand and supply gaps, it will improve sectoral performance; if not, it may cause line losses due to energy misuse, thus, a α i 4  = ∂ E E  i t   ∂ O E U  i t    < 0 >   .   3.2 Econometric approach 3.2.1 Unit root inspection First of all, before estimating the augmented ARDL model, we used multiple unit root tests to check the stationarity of the variables, including the ADF, PP, and KPSS. By catering information on unclear break dates [44 ], designed unit root tests to improve the weaknesses of typical unit root tests such as the (ADF, PP, and KPSS). The LS (2013) unit root test is a minimum LM with one structural break. Compared to other structural break tests, including the [45–47 ] tests, the LS (2013) test has demonstrated the better size and power characteristics and the capacity to identify break dates accurately. Consequently, adopting the LS (2013) test eliminates the risk of inaccurate estimations and incorrect break date predictions. The null hypothesis for the unit root tests used is H0 φ = 0    which is investigated against the alternative H0: φ < 0   .  3.2.2 Augmented ARDL bounds test To inspect the effect of PC, PP, UT, and OEU on economic expansion in Pakistan, this research uses an augmented ARDL cointegration technique presented by Ref. [22 ]. Though several cointegration techniques exist, for instance Refs. [48–50 ], these models cannot be implemented unless the data series has a distinct order of integration. Therefore, the ARDL model is more adaptable in terms of applicability when data series do not exhibit a particular integration order. This model can be employed for variables with various integration orders, such as I (0)/I (1). But, it is inapplicable if any variable is I (2). Additionally, it may be used consistently with a limited dataset to produce consistent findings [51 ]. Also, when a lag selection is used for both the explained and explanatory variables, it provides additional alternatives and can handle the endogeneity problem if any arise. Undeniably, the ARDL model is widely utilized by researchers. This test is highly versatile since it permits the independent variables to be I (0)/I (1) if the dependent variable is I (1). However [21 ,22 ], has raised some concerns. Most scholars disregard the constraint that the explained variable be I (1) and the t -test proposed by Ref. [20 ]. Consequently, untrustworthy findings are obtained, leading to the degenerate instances highlighted by Ref. [22 ]. To address these issues [21 ,22 ], proposed the F-test for explanatory variables in addition to the F-test and t -test. Conversely [52 ], proved that merely the F-test and t -test statistic for the overall delayed explained variable was inadequate for the ARDL test. To eliminate the degenerate case-1 discovered by Ref. [20 ] and later [21 ], offered a second t -test or F-test on the lagged explanatory variables in addition to the ARDL test. Applying all three criteria is essential to differentiate between cointegration and degenerate situations. Hence, an augmented ARDL model was established, which required a superfluous t -test or F-test on the coefficients of lagged explanatory variables. The model is stated as follows:(1) Δ E E  t  = α 1  + ∑ i = 1  p  β 1   Δ E E  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  q  β 2   Δ P C  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  r  β 3   Δ P P  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  s  β 4   Δ U T  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  t  β 5   Δ O E U  t − i      γ 1  E E  t − i   + γ 2  P C  t − i   + γ 3  P P  t − i   + γ 4  U T  t − i   + γ 5  O E U  t − i   + σ 1  D t  + ε t           where ε t     denotes white noise error and Δ    the first difference. Whereas summation is short-run behavior, while γ 1  t o  γ 5     denoted long-run interactions. D t     is added to account for any structural discontinuities in the dataset. The H0, in this case, is γ 1     = γ 2     = 0, indicating that no long-term connection exists. In the ARDL modelling study, the first test is an F-test to determine the combined significance of the coefficients on the level [20 ,53 ]. For the lagged explained variables, the second test is a t -test. Underneath the H0 exhibit a nonstandard distribution in the context that no level connection exists irrespective of whether the regressors are I (0) or I. (1). Rather than using traditional critical values (CV) [20 ,22 ], presented two sets of asymptotic critical values: one for exclusively I (1) regressors and the second for entirely I (0). If the F-test and t -test statistic's value is less than the lower bound critical value, the H0   of “no long-run association” cannot be discarded. It indicated that there is no long-run link among the parameters. Unlike, if the F-test and t -test statistic's value exceeded the upper bound CV, the H0   would be discarded. It suggested the existence of long-run linkages among the parameters. Lastly, if the test statistic's value is neither less than nor larger than the two critical values, indicating that the value lies between the two CVs, the judgment about the long-run associations remains ambiguous. To evaluate the short-run characteristics, the error correction model (ECT) is as follows:(2) Δ E E  t  = α 1  + ∑ i = 1  p  θ 1   Δ E E  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  q  θ 2   Δ P C  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  r  θ 3   Δ P P  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  s  θ 4   Δ U T  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  t  θ 5   Δ O E U  t − i   + ω E C T  t − 1   + μ t       Where θ 5     = short-run complexities, E C T    = error correction term that quantifies the swiftness with which each epoch adjusts to equilibrium afterwards, a shock in the respective parameter that provides an estimate. The predicted value of the ECT is between −1 and 0, with 0 indicating no merging toward equilibrium and 1 indicating complete conjunction, which means that any shock in the current period is adequately adjusted for the next period if the value is −1. These three test statistics utilized to establish the cointegration connection are as follows:(3) F o v e r l l  t e s t   H 0  : ∅ 1  = ∅ 2  = ∅ 3  = ∅ 4  = 0     (4) t D V  t e s t   H 0  : ∅ 1  = 0     (5) F I D V  t e s t   H 0  :  ∅ 2  = ∅ 3  = ∅ 4  = 0      The tests stated in Eqs. (3) and (4)  are the F-test and t -test, respectively, as suggested by Pesaran et al. (2001). At the same time, Eq. (5)  is the new F-test proposed by Refs. [21 ,22 ]. The three tests must be larger than the critical values and statistically significant to establish cointegration. Otherwise, the connection of cointegration would be invalid. If both the general F-statistic and the t-statistic are significant, but the F-independent statistics are not, degenerate case 1 exists. When both F- and t-statistics are significant, the degenerate condition is defined as 2.  3.2.3 Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag model In this analysis, linking PC, PP, UT, OEU, and EE in Pakistan are examined by the ARDL framework following [54 ,55 ]. The ARDL model is estimated in two ways: First, the co-integration test ARDL model confirms whether a long-term causal association between the parameters exists or not. The model is as follows:(6) Δ E E  t  = β 0  + β 1  E E  t − 1   + β 2  P C  t − 1   + β 3  P P  t − 1   + β 4  U T  t − 1   + β 5  O E U  t − 1   + ∑ i = 1  a  β 6   E E  t − i   + ∑ i = 1  b  β 7   P C  t − i   + ∑ i = 1  c  β 8   P P  t − i   + ∑ i = 1  d  β 9   U T  t − i   + ∑ i = 1  e  β 10   O E U  t − i   + ε t      where Δ is the first difference, ε t     Error term and a - e are the maximal lag instructions determined by AIC. The F-statistic is utilized to test the long-term equilibrium association between horizontal parameters. Second, the ARDL model evaluates the variables' long- and short-term interactions. The ARDL model to measure the long-term connection describes as follows:(7) Δ E E  t  = γ 0  ∑ i = 1  p 1   γ 1   E E  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p 2   γ 2   P C  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p 3   γ 3   P P  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p 4   γ 4   U T  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  P 5   γ 5   O E U  t − 1   + ε t       The ARDL-ECT model can be exercised to approximate the short-run association for the specific model:(8) Δ E E  t  = γ 0  ∑ i = 1  p 1   γ 1   E E  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p 2   γ 2   P C  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p 3   γ 3   P P  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  p 4   γ 4   U T  t − i   + ∑ i = 0  P 5   γ 5   O E U  t − 1   + γ 6  E C T  t − 1   μ t      Where γ 0     indicates the intercepts and γ 1   t o  γ 4     are the predictors' coefficients. Furthermore, ECT represents the error correction term, while the error correction parameter illustrates how deviations from long-term equilibrium are addressed. Besides, t = 1, …, T represents the research time, and p 1  t o  p 5    represents the lags given by the AIC. Finally, the first difference operator is Δ   , and the stochastic error term is μ t    .   3.3 Frequency-domain-causality (FDC) The study also determined the relationship between PC, PP, UT, OEU, and economic expansion in Pakistan. Hence [56 ], causality test employed in this study. Unlike the conventional Granger causality test, the approximation approach exercised in this study allows for determining the response variable at specific time intervals. Preliminary, this test is developed [57 ,58 ]. The major argument between the time method and the frequency-domain model is time method demonstrations when a certain deviation occurs within a time series. In contrast, the FDC calculates the level of a certain change in data series [59 ]. The FDC facilitates the elimination of seasonal fluctuations within a limited timeframe FDC. Nonlinearities and causality transformations can also be observed utilizing the [56 ] test. It means that previous shifts can be identified and policy action implemented. The method is constrained to a fixed time horizon and cannot simulate an unlimited period. FDC allows one to differentiate between long-, medium-and short-term causality between time series data. The frequency-domain causality model used in this study complies with the standards outlined by Ref. [58 ]. The bivariate guesstimate ( M y → x   )   , the H 0     that y does not encourage or forecast x at a frequency ( ω )    is uttered as:(9) M y → x   ( ω )  = 0      For easiness, the H 0     is the cause and effect among two factors ( | x t  , y t   |  )    Both employed as an objective and forecast variable could be designed by exercising an F-test coefficient with a standardized conceptual method. The framework for the VAR of x t     is described as:(10) x t  = α 1  x t − 1   + … + α p  x t − p   + β 1  y t − 1   … + β p  y t − p   + ε 1 t       where the linear constraint in Eq. (10)  is similar to the H 0    ( M y → x   )    = 0, though; α and ß are the predictable descriptions, t is time, p    lag, ε t     is the error term. The research utilizes Stata-16, Gauss, and EViews software to carry out the econometric procedures.   4 Results and discussion Before the descriptive statistics, all variables are transformed to natural logarithmic form except UT, which is already in percentage form and has modest values. Table 2   exhibits the descriptive statistics outcome; it signifies the peak shown by Kurtosis, a normal distribution trend validated by Jarque-Bera test statistics. The average of EE, PC, PP, UT and OEU is 5.844, 4.410, 4.629, 0.539 and 3.282, respectively. 4.1 Unit root tests The first step is to ensure the stationary at I (0) or I (1), especially the response variable. Noticeably, it is not desirable to include I (2) regressors or display seasonal unit origins [60 ]. Three-unit root measures, including ADF- PP and KPSS utilized to check the order of integration to meet the criteria. Table 3  displays the outcomes of root unit evaluations. The results of Table 3 (Appendix)  show that the H0 of ADF and PP in all parameters cannot be dismissed at the level of constant and trend, but it is rejected at the first difference in all series. Conversely, KPSS results with constant and trend H0 rejected at the level in all variables, excluding EE and UT, are significant at the first difference. As a result, all data series integrated and allowed to proceed with the ARDL bounds test. Following [19 ,61 ], this research used the LS (2013) unit root test, and the results in Table 4 (Appendix)  reveal that all parameters are integrated in mix order at I (0) and I (1), with Break in level, Break in level & trend and indicating one structural break. The structural breaks signify that, throughout the last four decades, Pakistan has experienced a variety of internal and external obstacles that have hampered its economic progress and posed a significant threat to its integrity. A decade of military rule (1977–1988) damaged democratic norms and aspirations, yet the yearning for democracy remains strong today. (1988–1999) Pakistan effectively transitioned to parliamentary democracy over almost a decade [62 ]. The 1992 India-Pakistan floods were the greatest storm in recorded history, destroying the agricultural industry. They were caused by monsoon rains and hard weather [63 ]. In addition, in 1992, the government launched Operation Clean-up in Karachi, Pakistan's commercial powerhouse; this is reflected in the projected breakpoint [64 ]. Political instability, law and order, and the Indo-Pak Kargil conflict were key concerns for sectors in the 1990s. Numerous years in Pakistan saw structural disruptions due to various factors, including slow EG due to political turmoil and exceptionally low oil prices as the aftereffects of Asian economic crises. In 2002–2003, political turmoil and oil strikes accelerated the economy's downturn. Nevertheless, after the layoffs, the economy accelerated between 2004 and 2010. The analysis findings show that the augmented ARDL model can be referred to with the orders I (0) and I(I).  4.2 Bounds test and augmented ARDL outcomes The bounds test is used to inspect the long-term association among the factors. Table 3   summarizes the augmented ARDL bound test findings and the CV used to determine the significance of the derived test statistics. These critical values were derived from Ref. [20 ] for the F-general and t-tests [65 ], for the general F-test adjusted for small sample size, and [22 ] for the F-test for explanatory variables. The augmented ARDL cointegration results exceed the critical values in the lower and upper limits at the 1% significance level in all three tests. As a result, the series are cointegrated and evolve in lockstep throughout time. The short and long-term empirical findings show in Table 4  . The coefficient of PC is 0.141 and 0.253, indicating significant association in the short and long-run. Implies that a 1% upsurge in PC upsurges economic expansion, meaning that efficient and effective energy usage boosts economic activity in Pakistan. In order to meet SDG 7 by 2030, Pakistan must increase energy production while guaranteeing that everyone has access to adequate energy supplies [2 ]. The results are similar [66–68 ], stating that efficient energy usage contributes to rising economic stability in the country. Further, a 1% rise in PP decreases economic expansion by 0.028% and 0.744% in the short and long term, implying that PP could play a substantial role in the economic expansion in Pakistan. The cost of manufacturing rises due to high pricing, which has a negative effect on the country's economy. As stated in SDG-7, investment in renewable and clean energy sources such as solar, wind, and thermal electricity may assist policymakers in achieving sustainable development. The outcome corroborates [10 ,69 ] conclusion that energy prices highly contribute to economic progress. While the urban transition has a positive and substantial effect on economic expansion in the short run, a 1% upsurge in UT upsurges economic expansion by 0.82% in the short term. In developing nations like Pakistan, where economic conditions continue to suffer due to global economic conditions after COVID-19, limited employment, living conditions, and other social amenities could make urban expansion economically lucrative in the short term. However, a 1% upsurge in UT decreases EE by 0.358% in the long term; it seems to be a shift from rural to urban migration driving the country's greater population growth rates in the cities. As Pakistan's urbanization progresses, the economy gets over-urbanized to the point that it is no longer viable. Because of administrative, employment, accommodation, and other various challenges. According to SDG-11 (sustainable cities and communities  ), the fast expansion of cities due to growing populations and increased migration has triggered a boom in mega-cities, particularly in the developing world, and slums are becoming a more prominent factor in urban life. Sustainable development cannot be accomplished without fundamentally improving the design and management of urban places. The outcome aligns with [6 ,70–73 ] stated that the urbanization factor could perform a dynamic role in EG if properly managed. Additionally, a 1% rise in OEU rises economic expansion by 0.14% in the short run. Infers that other electricity uses (street lights/bulk supply/unauthorized usage) stimulate economic expansion, which has a considerable role in economic stability if managed properly in Pakistan. Our finding is in line [6 ,43 ,74 ] concerning OEU and EG in Pakistan. Furthermore, the adjustment coefficient of the ECT is −0.064, meaning that when short-run variation deviates from long-run equilibrium, it could be pushed back to equilibrium with an adjustment magnitude of −0.064 and economic expansion becomes self-stabilizing.  4.3 FDC and diagnostic inspection outcomes After calculating the short and long-term augmented ARDL approximation, we use the FDC test [56 ] to investigate the causal effect of PC, PP, UT, OEU, and EE. Table 5   presents the short-, medium, and long-term outcomes. The empirical outcome discloses that PP has a long-medium and short-term influence on EE; however, PC causes EE in the long and medium run. Further, UT authorizes the long and short-term effects on EE, but OEU shows the long-run impact on EE. The overall results advocate that the critical effect of energy prices and distractions on electricity demand implies that price and load management policies could be used to regulate PC or encourage users to use electricity more efficiently. In a country like Pakistan, where energy demand is high and installed capacity is insufficient to meet the demand, a circular debt problem has arisen due to inefficient pricing and low bill recoveries, resulting in power outages. The UT is also acknowledged as a potential factor because economies such as Pakistan are devoted to economic progression and urbanization, and fallouts in several factors were reassuring PC. As a result, the rise in UT level would not result in a substantial increase in power use, creating a theoretical foundation for urban growth. Contrary to the [70 ] reported finding, there is no causality between energy prices, GDP, and energy use. Similar to Refs. [75 ,76 ], stated that EC and urbanization are pivotal for economic development. Numerous diagnostic techniques validate the relevant model, which is stated in Table 6   and confirms that serial correlation and heteroscedasticity do not exist. The Jarque-Bera and Ramsey RESET test also discarded the H0, signifying that the model's projected residuals are usually distributed and properly quantified. In other words, the model is correct for policy motives. Stability tests applying CUSUM and CUSUM square to pinpoint the long and short-term parameters. Fig. 1   show the CUSUM and CUSUM square measures graphs, showing that both values are within the critical boundaries at a significance level of 5%, indicating that the long and short-term parameters are stable.   5 Discussion The augmented ARDL and FDC findings suggest that energy conservation could be feasible in Pakistan. However, the rise in energy prices has a detrimental economic impact. Also, proper urban transition management and other electricity usage can help Pakistan's economic activity achieve SDGs 7 and 11 [2 ]. The policies outlined are combined with our outcomes that PC and OEU induce economic expansion while PP and UT are critical for long-term sustainable development and have several consequences. First and foremost, the importance of energy in any country's EG is critical. Access to modern energy services is also decisive for meeting basic social requirements, stimulating productivity expansion, and fostering human development. It is due to the impact of energy services on productivity, health, education, clean drinking water, and communication services. Second, when individual producers battle for market share, proposals to liberalize the sector should stimulate efficiency and innovation in production and distribution, resulting in lower costs. Lower energy costs, as this occurs, would lower the cost of a vital input for the manufacturing sector, allowing them to increase production and strengthen the economy. As a result of consolidation, prices in a liberalized energy sector will represent market and cost factors more adequately. It naturally implies that the fuel oil price changes used in the generation process would be expressed in higher electricity prices. The Pakistan government's strategy is to supply electricity to customers at the lowest possible expense under the government's financial restrictions [19 ]. In the end, the government subsidizes the cost of fuel oil, lowering the ultimate price to the customer. Liberalization would almost certainly necessitate any changes to this system. Reforms in the administrative framework will also be needed. Currently, the major energy distributor must petition for adjustments to the prices it is permitted to charge customers; moreover, such a regime is completely unsuitable for a market with many competitors. As a result, any other mix of legislation and methods to advance innovation will be required to meet the goals of consumer safety and price transparency. Additionally, the provision to use a large proportion of renewable energy sources in electricity generation, including wind, solar, biomass, and biogas, should help reduce some of the uncertainty in PP triggered by the inherent fluctuation in crude oil prices. Presently, the US administration reported electricity mix in Pakistan consists of 27% hydro, 64% fossil energy, and 9% other renewables and nuclear power [77 ]. Although Pakistan has much capacity for green energy, it is still a long way behind the rest of the globe in terms of growth. This strategy could minimize volatility and infirm demand and supply; as a result, economic growth. To the extent that the specific costs of producing electricity from renewable sources are higher than those of fossil fuels, the positive effects on the climate and the society benefiting from using clean energy sources may adjust for the increased cost of production. In other words, renewable electricity's economic and environmental benefits can compensate for the economic costs. However, given our projections of rising potential electricity demand, policies should be introduced to ensure that customers do not simply shift from high electricity usage generated from fossil fuels to high renewable consumption [78 ]. Third, the country's urban development pace and economic situation determine the positive and negative effects of urban transition. Swift urbanization due to growing populations and migration has caused an increase in megacities, mainly in the developing world, and slums are becoming a more protuberant element of urban life [79,80 ]. According to SDG-11, sustainable cities need the creation of employment and business possibilities, safe and inexpensive housing, and the development of robust societies and economies. It comprises investing in public transit, creating green public spaces, and encouraging equitable and participative urban development and governance [2 ]. Finally, since PC is crucial for long-run economic expansion, securing the electricity supply would be critical to achieving expected growth in energy and sustaining economic progress. Thus, despite the apparent push to use more green energy sources, an increase in energy capability, the construction of energy supply facilities, and contingency preparation in the event of a technological or political interruption of fuel imports would be crucial. It would also affect energy use and, as a result, energy-saving policies. Though urbanization can play a significant role if used properly, OEU should prevent ever-increasing energy waste. Our findings back up previous research constrained, for example, [6 ,11 ,73 ]. The findings would help policymakers achieve SDGs 7 and 11 for Pakistan.  6 Conclusion and policy implications In previous decades, electricity production patterns have evolved due to urban transition and political and economic activities. Policymakers seek remedies for energy efficiency and concerns for sustainable economic development. Therefore, the current study investigates the relationship between power consumption, power prices, urban transition, other electricity use, and economic expansion using a multivariate framework from 1970 to 2018 for Pakistan. To determine the short and long-run relationship between the variables novel augmented ARDL co-integration approach was used. The Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) method detects long, medium, and short-run causality between variables. Before using the augmented ARDL bound approach, the time series properties were examined. As a consequence, the first ADF, PP, KPSS, and then second generation econometric techniques such as the Lee and Strazicich with structural break are utilized to confirm that all series are integrated at I (0), and I (1) and neither of the series identified I (2). The augmented ARDL bounds findings indicate that the series are cointegrated and move in the long run in lockstep. Following that, diagnostic procedures are exercised to accept findings with policy implications. The stability measurements were also investigated in the sample using (CUSUM) and (CUSUMSQ) tests. The empirical results of augmented ARDL analysis show fascinating indications between study variables. To summarize the findings, long- and short-run power consumption improves Pakistan's economic activity. While the reduction in PP in the short and long run contributes to sustainable economic expansion in terms of cheap manufacturing, thrive the export in Pakistan. In comparison, UT has a positive and significant impact on economic expansion in the short term. Given the current economic challenges resulting from global economic conditions after COVID-19, limited employment, living conditions, and other social amenities may make urban growth economically profitable in the short run. In contrast, the long-term UT negatively impacts economic expansion, given that agriculture is regarded as the backbone of the Pakistani economy. A shift from rural to urban migration might be over-urbanized to the point that it is no longer sustainable as urbanization proceeds. Also, other energy use upsurges economic expansion in the short run. Additionally, the FDC findings revealed that power consumption, power prices, urban transition, and other energy use stimulate the economy in the long term. However, power consumption and prices suggested a medium-run causality. Also, power prices and urban transition found a short-run effect on Pakistan's economy. These findings back the hypothesis and show that power consumption, power price, urban transition, and other energy usage can significantly contribute to reaching sustainable development goals 7 and 11 in Pakistan. 6.1 Policy implications We propose the following recommendations based on empirical evidence: The positive influence of power consumption can boom economic activity in Pakistan. Hence, the government should take decisive action to bridge the gap between power demand and supply for economic stability in Pakistan. Another approach to ensure a successful energy strategy for energy conservation and sustainability is to liberalize the energy industry, allowing markets to more accurately match market and cost requirements and competitive energy operation in delivery and output due to competition. There has been some success in the Asian economies in this respect. Although Singapore privatized its energy market in 2001, ownership of the state-run PERTAMINA, which dominated the oil and gas sector, has gradually been eliminated in Indonesia. Hence, it remains seen how these structural reforms in the energy sector trigger EC and, as a result, economic growth. Policymakers should remove regulatory obstacles to rising investment in the country's energy supply sector. Power consumption must eliminate the pervasive use of unauthorized connections and other billing and collection flaws to regain control of its activities and close the gap between restricted supply and consumer demand. Additionally, the reduction in energy prices shows that the presence of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and private (PVT) fosters industry competitiveness and results in lower power rates for industrial users. The cost of power generation affects electricity pricing and, hence, consumer welfare and economic development. As a result, it is suggested to transition to low-cost power sources to reduce electricity costs. This research is the first step in determining the effect of regulatory measures on energy costs that may help accomplish SDGs-7 in Pakistan. Many Pakistani cities are overloaded and overpopulated due to fast population growth and urban transition. The most critical and tacit issue is the lack of urban center delimitation. It is essential to pay close attention to city formalization to make them sustainable and governable. Remote communities are established by allocating adequate agricultural services, which is likely to deter the move toward metropolitans, and this strategy may save extensive infrastructure costs. There seems to be an urgent need to prioritize basic needs such as education, health care, food, shelter, and water in rural regions. Urbanization should revise refugee policies regarding proper documentation, work registration capability, and job opportunity capacity. Aside from that, energy waste, such as OEU (street light/bulk supply), may significantly impact economic activity; therefore, it should be stopped. Even though the present research provides robust empirical evidence, additional research for other emerging countries should be undertaken to help with strategy and policy measures.  6.2 Limitations and future direction This study attempted to fill a gap in existing research by considering power consumption, power prices, urban transition, and other electricity use as important factors of economic expansion. The scholars are cognizant of the research's limitations resulting from their choice of nation and metrics. Even though the monetary variables were not deflated prior to estimation, the present study offers strong empirical data despite Pakistan's unpredictable price fluctuations, and more research for other emerging economies should be conducted. Other Asian nations might be the topic of future research due to significant parallels between Pakistan and these economies, which result from geographical closeness, and religious and cultural concerns. Another area of investigation might be the influence of the COVID health issue on power usage, given the repercussions of decreased economic activity.
