                  Achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-4 prerequisites quality education provisioning. In this context, we present important insights and references for educational interventions/investments to be tailored to local necessities in Pakistan. Several spatial statistical models such as the Global Moran's I-based spatial autocorrelation, multivariate clustering, and the Cluster and Outlier model are used to explore geographic heterogeneities and patterns. Additionally, significant determinants among several socio-economic, spatio-environmental, and infrastructural variables are identified for education status (EdS) using regression. As a result, a large geographic inequality regarding EdS is found in Pakistan. While a strong spatial association is evident, the districts in northern Punjab are identified as significant hotspots—higher EdS clusters (∼22% of total districts, 95% confidence). Majority of the 44% poorly performing districts belong to Balochistan province (95% confidence). Overall, the educational status in Punjab is higher as compared with other provinces. We find that four out of seven potential factors (i.e., poverty, urbanization, electricity accessibility, and school infrastructure) are statistically significant determinants of EdS. Among these, poverty is the most strongly associated (mean coefficient value −18.848) factor to control EdS. The results have important implications to decision-making for immediate or gradual actions in the context of spatially equitable provisioning of quality education through an informed prioritization (i.e., low performing districts). Based on the findings, while rigorous measures are needed for low performing regions and the identified determinants to improve education status, this study sheds light on the mechanisms to achieve SDG4, consequently promoting human well-being through educating communities.

It is noted that to represent the direct relation between poverty and EdS (higher the value of indicator means higher the EdS), the values for poverty are reversed, and the results should be interpreted as such.  Fig. 7   Table 1 Details on different determinants used as explanatory variables in the analysis.  Table 1   Variable Description and justification   School Infrastructure Measured by a school infrastructure score based on physical infrastructure of schools in each district. This score is based on the availability of electricity, water, toilet, and boundary wall in a school along with a building condition satisfaction. All these physical aspects make EdS in a district better (Parikh et al., 2015 ).  Poverty Poverty is one of the key factors considered for education globally (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Adjabeng, 2015; Zhang, 2017 ). Though Pakistan has a large-scale free education initiative, the poor status makes it difficult in terms of uniform, stationary, transportation, and extracurricular activities (i.e., affording participation in sports and joining for tours). It is measured as percent people in each district below the national poverty threshold.  Household Dependency Ratio It is estimated as the ratio of elderly and non-adult population (65 and 0–14 years old) to the population in working-age group (i.e., between 14 and 64 years). It is an important variable of socio-economic conditions of a society as higher dependency ratio leads to lesser financial incentives in a family leading to lesser opportunities to afford/pursue education (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Adjabeng, 2015).  Employment Status It is estimated as percentage of waged and salaried population (both male and female) of each district to its total population. The employment status is a key indicator of socio-economic conditions. Higher employment status ensures income, which is a primary driver of education affordability (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Adjabeng, 2015).  Access to Electricity Access to electricity  is facilitative for not only the improved literacy, but it also help better opportunities for information flow such as news through access to internet, radio, and television, resulting in better socio-economic networks (Dave, 2013 ; Sovacool & Ryan, 2016 ). Similarly, in this digital age where the learning is largely dependent on electric gadgets, the higher access to electricity provide broader learning opportunities. It is captured as the district's percent population having access to electricity.  Accessibility to Transportation Accessibility to transportation is one of the key spatio-environmental factors of schooling in developing countries like Pakistan (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Adjabeng, 2015; Francisco & Tanaka, 2019 ). The higher accessibility makes it feasible to attend schools as students need lesser travel time. Student travel also influences academic outcomes as mostly the high-performing schools are located in affluent neighborhoods making students travel to these localities. Transportation accessibility is measured using the population percentage within in 15 min to transportation. It is noted that we only focus on public transport to estimate the transportation accessibility.  Urbanization Level Urbanization factor is also an important factor and it can potentially influence the spatial inequality of EdS among different districts (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Adjabeng, 2015; Datzberger, 2018 ). As urban regions tend to have higher literacy rates along with larger number of schools due to higher population concentrations, this can result in geographic disparities among areas regarding education. Similarly, there are more opportunities and choices for urban residents as compared to rural ones. Level of urbanization is determined simply based on proportion of urban population of each district.     Table 2 Results from the ordinary least squares regression analysis.

Hong Kong Baptist University Office AAB-1222 Academic and Administration Building 224 Waterloo Rd Kowloon Tong Hong Kong Special Administrative Region       Achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-4 prerequisites quality education provisioning. In this context, we present important insights and references for educational interventions/investments to be tailored to local necessities in Pakistan. Several spatial statistical models such as the Global Moran's I-based spatial autocorrelation, multivariate clustering, and the Cluster and Outlier model are used to explore geographic heterogeneities and patterns. Additionally, significant determinants among several socio-economic, spatio-environmental, and infrastructural variables are identified for education status (EdS) using regression. As a result, a large geographic inequality regarding EdS is found in Pakistan. While a strong spatial association is evident, the districts in northern Punjab are identified as significant hotspots—higher EdS clusters (∼22% of total districts, 95% confidence). Majority of the 44% poorly performing districts belong to Balochistan province (95% confidence). Overall, the educational status in Punjab is higher as compared with other provinces. We find that four out of seven potential factors (i.e., poverty, urbanization, electricity accessibility, and school infrastructure) are statistically significant determinants of EdS. Among these, poverty is the most strongly associated (mean coefficient value −18.848) factor to control EdS. The results have important implications to decision-making for immediate or gradual actions in the context of spatially equitable provisioning of quality education through an informed prioritization (i.e., low performing districts). Based on the findings, while rigorous measures are needed for low performing regions and the identified determinants to improve education status, this study sheds light on the mechanisms to achieve SDG4, consequently promoting human well-being through educating communities.   Keywords SDG-4  Quality education  Spatial analysis  GWR  GIS    1 Introduction Being the fundamental right of every citizen, education is the strength and foundation of a country as it drives the development of a nation (Boulton, 2010 ; Wei et al., 2018 ). Education plays a central role in achieving economic and social stability of a country (Datzberger, 2018 ). Provisioning of education to the majority of the citizens in developing countries is key to tackling several issues including poverty reduction, industrial growth, and sustainable development in the long-term (Bali Swain & Ranganathan, 2021 ; Beeharry, 2021 ). For these reasons, access to quality education is explicitly stressed in the Sustainable Development Goals (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Afranie, 2015; Nations, 2015 ). Specifically, SDG-4 seeks to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education along with promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all”, and is among the most synergetic SDGs globally (Unterhalter, 2019 ; Asadikia et al., 2021 ; Bali Swain & Ranganathan, 2021 ; Naik et al., 2020 ). In Pakistan (a country with ∼225 million people), it is unfortunate that education has not received the attention that it deserves. It is the main reason the country also failed in achieving “Education for All (EFA)” agenda by 2015 (Shah et al., 2018 ). Recently, Pakistan has signed the Sustainable Development Goal agenda 2030, which aims to provide quality education and all-time learning. This initiative further looks forward to complete the unfinished work of EFA program. Still, Pakistan stands low in the Education for All Development Index (EDI), which necessitates attention of associated stakeholders and responsible authorities to evaluate the situation for an informed plan of actions to improve Pakistan's EDI (Shah et al., 2018 ). Educational System, particularly primary level, in developing countries like Pakistan faces multitude challenges and consequently, the countries suffer from an extensive education crisis (Bizenjo, 2020 ). About 23 million children (17% and 6% rural urban share, respectively) in Pakistan are not attending schools and those who are attending are not even learning basic levels (Secretariat, 2020 ). Lack of trained teaching staff, deficiency of teaching materials, low enrollment rate, poor infrastructure, and monitoring system of educational institutes indicate the poor academic performance in Pakistan.1  1 https://propakistani.pk/2019/06/10/latest-economic-survey-shows-a-higher-literacy-rate-and-educational-expenditure/ .   According to the United Nations Development Programme, Pakistan's literacy rate is ranked 152 out of 189 countries. Pakistan has the lowest literacy rate among the countries with comparative social and economic situation. According to Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) 2018-19 report (available at www.pbs.gov.pk ), the literacy rate of Pakistan is 60%, where Punjab has the highest literacy rate (64%) followed by Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan (57%, 55% and 40% literacy rate, respectively). Though Pakistan has a comparable gross domestic product (GDP) per capita relative to other neighbor developing countries, Pakistan stands low in the Human Development class according to the Human Development Index.2  2 http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi .   One of the primary reasons for this is the low achievements in education sector. Pakistan is spending around 2.3% of its GDP on education, which is the lowest among other south Asian countries such as India, Iran, and Afghanistan: whose educational share in GDP is 3.8%, 2.93%, and 5.9%, respectively. This situation shows a critical challenge faced by Pakistan regarding education, and states that efforts are required to improve the nation's educational status. Despite years of efforts, promises, investments, and initiatives, the education sector in Pakistan is still weak and struggling—particularly the basic education sector (Bizenjo, 2020 ; Habib et al., 2021 ; Khan, 2018 ). This condition attracts the attention of many researcher and academics to evaluate possible reasons and trends in education status (EdS) by various means. Several researchers have outlined a number of challenges related to low education quality/status in different regions globally (Abraha, 2019 ; Ali et al., 2021 ; Busemeyer, 2007 ; Kimosop et al., 2015 ; Lincove, 2009 ; Michaelowa, 2001 ; Shams, 2017 ; Wan et al., 2018 ). For instance, Akareem and Hossain (2016)  presented an evaluation on the students’ characteristics making their perception regarding dissimilar education quality in Bangladesh using the multinomial regression. They identify factors such as extracurricular activities, parent education, and age significantly related to the subject matter. Similarly, Allam (2020)  investigate the factors controlling the quality of higher education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia via factor analysis. The results suggested six factors covering infrastructural development, admissions, and curriculum etc. significantly associated with higher quality of education. Kimosop et al. (2015)  presented the spatial and gender inconsistencies in Kenya. They conclude that uneven school distribution and urbanization are mainly responsible for the variability of primary education exam scores in Kenya. Similarly, Yenice (2013)  showed that regarding geographic sufficiency opportunities, there is an uneven distribution of primary school facilities in the neighborhoods of Burder City, Turkey. Bulti et al. (2019)  evaluated the geographic heterogeneities and accessibility-related challenges in a small town of Ethiopia using geographic information systems. Their results ascertain the uneven distribution of primary schools in the study area putting certain children at disadvantage in terms of quality education provisioning. Population distribution, socio-economic factors, and spatial variables are the highlighted limitations in order to achieve an equitable educational service. He and Huang (2021)  presented an approach to assess the challenges related to obtaining educational services along with its social effects considering socio-economic and geographic aspects. Gao et al. (2016)  and Wan et al. (2018)  presented an evaluation on education-related sustainability and imbalance regarding the accessibility to primary and secondary schools and primary education development in China, respectively. Both of these studies leverage geographic information systems-based ArcGIS platform to provide insights for decision-making and policy development for quality education. In light of the above, it is noted that most of these studies focus on localized areas and few of these provide integrated evaluations (i.e., spatial patterns in education status and its determinants from a geographic, socioeconomic, and infrastructural perspective). Thus, not only there exists a gap in terms of large-scale assessments on education status to drive national policies, an integrated evaluation comprehending spatial distributions, patterns, and significant controlling factors is also rare to find—particularly in Pakistan (Ali et al., 2021 ; Batool & Webber, 2019a ; Komatsu, 2009 ; Shams, 2017 ). Hence, further research in this regard is desirable not only to fill this knowledge-gap but also support provisioning of quality education as well as achieving SDG-4. Notably, before resolving the issues related to lower EdS, it is desirable to identify the nature of hindering barriers such as the associated factors, and how they vary across space (Ansong et al., 2018 , 2015b , 2015a ; Sovacool & Ryan, 2016; Ullah et al., 2018 ). For instance, the cross-regional heterogeneity in educational status is largely influenced by the uneven distribution of funds and infrastructure, parity between males and females as well as the rural or urban nature of areas (Francisco & Tanaka, 2019 ; Queiroz et al., 2020 ). Additionally, the need to spatially analyze the EdS is considered important in the Human Development Index methodology and other progressive and associated indices like the Technological Achievement Index (Vidyattama et al., 2019 ). Similarly, varying socio-economic conditions also create disparities in educational status of different regions (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Adjabeng, 2015 ; Batool & Webber, 2019b ; Chatterjee et al., 2018 ). The unavailability of several basic requirements such as electricity, transportation access, and drinking water at institutes are also among the reasons of poor quality of education (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Afranie, 2015; Valerio Mendoza, 2018 ; Wati & Tranter, 2015 ; Wei et al., 2018 ). The identification of such influencing factors is important to initiate actions plans to improve the EdS. Such identifications can further provide important insights related to spatial segregation in EdS along with highlighting key factors to influence the overall education within an area of interest. This information is of particular interest to provide solutions to challenges of spatial educational inequality of a nation. In connection to this, the key objectives of this study include identification and examination of geographic heterogeneity in EdS in Pakistan at national scale using district level assessments via spatial distributional approaches, and evaluating several determinants of EdS. These analyses could progressively provide insights to promote a contextual understanding of education requirements in Pakistan. Such district-level location intelligence-based insights are particularly valuable information to act as key references for policy making, actions for effective service delivery, and initiatives for tailored educational programs, which is more beneficial to improve overall EdS and consequently move towards the achievement of SGD-4 than would otherwise be possible. Section 2  discusses data acquisition, several techniques applied for spatial analyses, defining the factors potentially influencing the EdS along with modelling the relationship between them, if any. Section 3  outlines the results in a systematic way and Section 4  provide discussions on findings along with highlighting several potential implications for policy and decision-making in the context of SDG-4. The study is finally concluded in Section 5 .  2 Data, methods, and processing The present study is conducted in a number of steps including: defining and collection of data on several representative indicators (education, socio-economic aspects, spatio-environmental factors, and infrastructure) and other spatial datasets (i.e., vector data of administrative boundaries), assessment of spatial inequality in educational status using geo-information models, and evaluating different determinants of educational status. As mentioned above, the administrative unit used in this study is the “district” level as most of the local planning and decision-making in Pakistan happens at this level. The analyses are conducted on 112 districts covering Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) provinces in Pakistan. It is noted that though it would be ideal to conduct the analysis for all districts in Pakistan, the unavailability of data on indicators, particularly socio-economic, limits the inclusion of the districts from Gilgit Baltistan, Azad Jammu&Kashmir, and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA: merged in KPK in 2018). As the assessments are primarily made in a spatial environment, a geo-information data repository is established for data storage, retrieval, and analyses. The ArcGIS Pro. software from the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) is used for data visualization and several spatial analyses. The comprehensive schematic for overall workflow is presented in Fig. 1  . To represent the EdS of each district, an education score is computed following the approach of the Education for All Development Index presented by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2012 ). This education score is a composite of different indicators including access to education, gender parity, attainment, and achievement (Ailaan, 2017 ). The data used for this composite is from the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (PSLM, 2020 ), the National Education Management Information System, and the Annual Status of Education Reports from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (www.pbs.gov.pk ), the Academy for Education Planning and Management (www.aepam.edu.pk ), and the Idara-e-Taleem-o-Agahi (www.itacec.org ), respectively. Access is measured using the gross enrollment rate for school-going-age children (6–10 years old), which is more commonly used indicator to capture access. Educational attainment can be captured using the indicators representing continual survival in schools such as completion of primary school education, survival rates, years of schooling, and persistence to next educational level. In this study, the survival rates to 5th grade is used to measure the attainment as reported by the National Education Management Information System (Ailaan, 2017 ). Achievement is calculated using data on achievement in language (i.e., ability of children to read an Urdu story or English sentence), mathematics (i.e., capability of children to perform division of 2-digit numbers over a 1-digit number), and the literacy rate of district using arithmetic mean. To measure the gender parity (dividing number of girls/boys), the arithmetic-mean of gender ratio of access (enrollment) and 5th grade survival rates is computed. Using these four indicators (i.e., access, attainment, achievement, and gender parity) a composite education score is computed via taking the average. The data on these indicators are retrieved from the Alif Ailaan, a nonprofit organization working on education in Pakistan (https://www.alifailaan.pk/ ). The education score ranges between 0 and 100 for each district, where values closer to 100 represent relatively better EdS of a district and values closer to 0 reflect poor EdS. This education score is used to explore geographical heterogeneities/inequalities and spatial patterns in EdS along with identification of potential determinants of varying EdS across districts of Pakistan. 2.1 Spatial analysis 2.1.1 Exploring geographies of education status To explore the spatial inconsistencies in EdS across the study area, a vector layer of districts is used and the education scores are appended to its data table. To evaluate the distribution of EdS across all districts, thematic maps are produced. Furthermore, an unsupervised classification-based multivariate machine learning algorithm is applied to EdS and several socio-economic, spatio-environmental, and infrastructural variables (Jain, 2010 ). The details on these variables are provided in Table 1  . The applied machine learning algorithm is available as part of the Spatial Statistics toolbox of ArcGIS Professional (see further details at https://bit.ly/3H4urhg ). The unsupervised nature of this algorithm makes it less biased as compared to other supervised classification techniques as the number of natural clusters in the data are determined based on Calinski-Harabasz pseudo F-statistics. Among the two clustering methods (i.e., k-means and k-medoids), this study uses k-medoids as it is less sensitive to outliers/extreme values, if any. Using this approach, the entire study area is clustered in statistically distinct groups (p = 0.05), which have maximum within-group similarity and maximum intra-group dissimilarity. In addition, to identify the spatial patterns in the EdS, if any, we firstly apply a spatial autocorrelation technique using the Global Moran's I method. This assessment helps us identify if there is any global relationship between space and EdS (i.e., either the geographic distribution of EdS is clustered, dispersed, or random). Later, a Local Indicators for Spatial Association (LISA)-based assessment is carried out to identify the statistically significant (p = 0.05) localized hotspots (regions with higher EdS), cold spots (regions with lower EdS), and outliers. This situation explains that if localized patterns are identified in the data, there is at least 95% confidence. This evaluation is particularly helpful to highlight the priority intervention areas for appropriate measures and designing the feasible as well as informed action plans. It is noted that the conceptualization of spatial relationships for both global and local models in our study is based on contiguity spatial weight matrix because the data is in vector polygons (i.e., districts). Hence, there is no need to specify a particular distance bandwidth/threshold as it is being decided based on the number of sharing boundaries between different districts.  2.1.2 Identifying determinants of education status Identifying determinants of EdS is essential to drive effective decision-making and policy development for further improvements in educational system—leading to SDG-4 achievement. Hence, the selection of controlling factors should represent the reality of the study area so that the results are accordingly useful for references to decision-making. However, while considering the reality of the study area (Pakistan in this case) could result in a long list of independent variables influencing EdS, their availability at the scale of measure, especially in developing countries, is a matter of concern. This is primarily due to lack of data aggregation and absence of centralized data repositories in most of the developing countries. In addition, the problem of multicollinearity in fitting a multivariate regression model should also be avoided to achieve unbiased results (Allen, 1997 ). Considering these conditions, based on literature review, authors' own expertise, and the availability of data at the scale of this study (i.e., district scale), seven potential determinants of education are selected. These determinants not only encompass the socio-economic aspects of communities (e.g., poverty, household, and employment), but also account for the spatio-environmental and infrastructural factors (e.g., urbanization, school infrastructure, and accessibility to electricity and transportation). The selected variables show high relevancy to Pakistan in particular and developing countries in general. For instance, we have included the indicator “access to electricity” in our analysis, which is particularly important for Pakistan due to country's long-held load-shedding problem since last decade. Similarly, the access to transportation is particularly relevant variable due to inconsistent distribution of educational institutes and un-equal development of transportation infrastructure in developing countries. Poverty is also one of the core indicators to drive education status in developing countries, and for a nation like Pakistan whose ∼1/4th percent of population is living below the poverty line (ADB, 2015 ), this indicator is definitely relevant. Further details on these variables are provided in Table 1 . The data on several socio-economic variables are retrieved from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics along with the Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys (MICS) from the provincial Bureaus of Statistics. Before modelling the relationship, we compute the variance inflation factor (VIF) to check the multicollinearity among the variables (James et al., 2017 ). If the VIF for a variable is larger than the threshold (7.5), the variables tend to be redundant, which potentially cause problem in the regression analysis (Rawlings et al., 2001 ). In our case the VIF values for all the variables such as infrastructure, poverty, household dependency, employment, access to electricity, transportation accessibility, and urbanization level is well-below the threshold (i.e., 2.23, 3.42, 2.27, 1.44, 2.10, 1.49, and 1.53, respectively). Thus, there is no redundancy between the explanatory variables and the regression model could be fitted. To evaluate the relationship between EdS and seven explanatory variables varied by districts, we estimated and compared two analytical methods including the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and the geographically weighted regression (GWR). The OLS is performed with the following equation:(1) Y = β 0  + β 1  x 1  + β 2  x 2  + … + β n  x n  ,     where Y    represents dependent variable (ES in this case), β 0  , β 1  , β 2  , … , β n     are the slopes for each explanatory variable x 1  , x 2  , … , x n    . Compared with the OLS model, which is a global evaluation, the GWR accounts for any local relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables assuming that this relation is spatially dynamic. In GWR method, local regressions are constructed to compute local coefficients via providing higher weights to neighboring data points (Fotheringham et al., 2003 ). Given the EdS and seven explanatory variables, the GWR-based spatial model in this study is defined as:(2) EdS ( X i   ,  Y i   )  = β 0  ( X i   ,  Y i   )  + β 1  ( X i   ,  Y i   )   School Infrastructure Score  +  β 2  ( X i   ,  Y i   )   Poverty Rate  +  β 3  ( X i   ,  Y i   )   Household Dependency Ratio  +  β 4  ( X i   ,  Y i   )   Employment Status  +  β 5  ( X i   ,  Y i   )   Access to Electricity  +  β 6  ( X i   ,  Y i   )   Accessibility to Transportation  +  β 7  ( X i   ,  Y i   )   Urbanization Level  +  ε i       where ( X i   ,  Y i   )     represent the locations in the area of interest, β 0     indicates the relationship between EdS and the explanatory variables with an approximate distance from  ( X i   ,  Y i   )    , and ε i     is the error term. It is noted that among two weighting methods for GWR proposed by Fotheringham et al. (2003) —bi-square and Gaussian—the adaptive bi-square kernel is used in this study to measure the distance as it is a better choice for data represented in polygons of different areas/size. The bi-square function accounts for the observation density and results into an optimal proportion of neighbors to be utilized for each local regression. In addition, for the sake of visualization and effective communication of findings, the identified statistically significant determinants are used to prepare bivariate choropleth maps (i.e., EdS and each determinant). This visualization helps us evaluate the quantitative relationship between EdS and individual statistically significant determinant in a spatial sense.    3 Results 3.1 Geographies of education status in Pakistan The results for overall spatial distribution of EdS in Pakistan at district level are presented in Fig. 2  . A north-south geographical heterogeneity is evident in the EdS in Pakistan at district level. It is observed that the districts with relatively higher EdS dominantly belong to Punjab province in Pakistan with concentration in districts around Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and Lahore (values > 1.5 std. dev.). However, comparatively lower EdS can be seen in lower Punjab (values < 0.5 std. dev.). Punjab is followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) provinces in terms of EdS with values ranging between −0.5 and 1.5 std. dev. for most of the districts. The poorest situation regarding EdS is observed in Balochistan province as most of the districts are below −0.5 std. dev. value. A majority of the districts from Sindh province show intermediate level of EdS (values between −1.5 and 0.5 std. dev.). The only district with the higher EdS in Sindh is Karachi—the largest city in Pakistan. Based on the multivariate spatial clustering analysis, two spatially distinct statistically significant at p = 0.05) groups are identified (i.e., districts in blue and yellow colors in Fig. 1 b). With reference to EdS, the districts in blue group have relatively better status as compared with the yellow group (Fig. 3  ). While the blue group consists of ∼56% of total districts, the EdS of ∼44% districts in Pakistan is very poor. Most of the districts in lower EdS group (95% confidence) are from Balochistan province followed by Sindh and KPK. Only two districts from Punjab are identified in the lower EdS group (Fig. 2 b). This situation shows the cross-regional inequality in EdS in Pakistan. Among the identified statistically distinct spatial groups based on multivariate spatial clustering analysis, the EdS of blue group is close to third quartile value reflecting a higher status of education in these districts (Fig. 3 ). This higher EdS is due to better performance of different spatio-social variables as all of the variable scores are above average, particularly school infrastructure and poverty. Please note that the poverty variable for this analysis is inverted to have a direct relation (i.e., the higher the value the better the EdS). On the other hand, the districts in lower EdS group have very poor conditions regarding school infrastructure, poverty, and access to electricity (i.e., values below first quartile). The results from the global Moran's I-based spatial autocorrelation shows a statistically significant clustering for the EdS in Pakistan (Fig. 4  a). The resultant value of Moran's I (0.433) suggests a positive spatial correlation which is statistically significant at p = 0.01. Given the z-score value of 7.69, there is a less than 1% likelihood that the identified clustered pattern is the result of random chance (i.e., reject the null hypothesis that EdS is not clustered across the study area). Here, once it is confirmed that the clusters do exist for the EdS, the next step is to determine the significant hotspots (i.e., regions of higher EdS) and the cold spots (i.e., the regions of relatively lower EdS) at p = 0.05. The results from LISA show that the hotspots of EdS are identified in northern region of Punjab province in Pakistan with some districts from KPK (i.e., districts in blue color in Fig. 4 b). This high-high cluster comprises of ∼22% of total districts. On the contrary, the cold spots are identified in the southern regions of Pakistan with most of the districts belonging to Balochistan province (i.e., yellow shaded districts in Fig. 4 b).  3.2 Exploring determinants of education status The results from the OLS regression model are presented in Table 2  . It is evident that the OLS model is able to explain ∼60% of the variance in the dependent variable (EdS in this case). Furthermore, out of total seven independent variables, four are statistically significantly associated with EdS. Among these four, two are statistically significant at >99% confidence (i.e., school infrastructure and poverty) and two are statistically significant at >90% confidence (i.e., access to electricity and urbanization level). It is observed that poverty is comparatively the most associated variable with EdS (coefficient value = 22.01) as compared with other variables followed by urbanization level (94% confidence and coefficient value = 11.52) and access to electricity (91% confidence and coefficient value = 11.06). Though the school infrastructure is positively associated, the relationship between poverty and EdS is negative (Table 2 ), which is expected. Similarly, access to transportation is positively associated with EdS, but it is not statistically significant (coefficient value = 11.52, p = 0.62). On the other hand, household dependency and employment have negative relationship with EdS, but they are both insignificant (coefficients −2.93 and −7.79, p-values 0.7 and 0.13, respectively). Furthermore, we compute the Moran's I index value for OLS-resulted standardized residual to check either the geographic distribution has any pattern or not. The result show that residual is randomly distributed (Moran's I Index Value = 0.0039, z-score = 0.22, p-value = 0.83) and there is no clustering pattern identified for it. The summary of the results from the GWR model are presented in Table 3  . The positive and negative variations in the coefficients present the spatially varying relationship between each explanatory variable and EdS. For instance, the coefficient of poverty reflects its negative relationship with EdS across space. Similar to the OLS, it is observed that the strongest relationship is observed for poverty, suggesting the importance of reducing poverty to improve the EdS. In order to understand the spatial inconsistency of the relationship among EdS and several explanatory variables, the local regression coefficients are presented in Fig. 5  . It is evident that different variables have different degree of spatial relevance to EdS across the study area. For instance, school infrastructure tends to be a strong predictor in southern regions of the country (i.e., districts in Sindh and Balochistan—red shades in Fig. 5 a). Similarly, employment and transportation access (Fig. 5 d and f, respectively) are also strong predictors in southern regions. On the contrary, poverty, household dependency, and urbanization are strong predictors for northern areas—particularly for Punjab and KPK provinces (Fig. 5 b, c, and g, respectively). Though access to electricity is a strong predictor in northern areas, its tendency is the highest for central Punjab and northern Balochistan (Fig. 5 e). The geographic distribution for the standardized residuals from the GWR model does not represent any obvious under or over prediction pattern (Fig. 6  a). This adequacy of the GWR model is also verified via running a spatial autocorrelation analysis using the global Moran's I index. It is observed that the spatial distribution is random as the result for Moran's I test is statistically insignificant (i.e., Moran's I Index value = −0.067, z-score = −0.95, p-value = 0.34). Fig. 5 b presents the geographic distribution of local R2  for the GWR-based regression model fitted for each district. This local value at district scale represents how well or bad the model performs to fit the data in each corresponding district. It is evident from the range of local R2  values (i.e., 0.61 to 0.76) that the explanatory efficiency of the model differs by districts. Moreover, there is a regional graphical pattern increasing as one moves from south to north. In general, it is observed that the model tends to fit the regions in the north better as compared to the ones in the south. Still, the lower-limit of local R2 s (i.e., 0.61) suggests that the model performs well even in the south—still a better fit than the OLS.  3.3 Ordinary least squares vs geographically weighted regression model Though the residual distribution in both cases (i.e., for OLS and GWR models) does not show any spatial pattern—showing the reliability of the models—it is observed that the GWR model outperforms the OLS model in several aspects. Firstly, while the highest variance explained by the GWR model is 76% (Fig. 6 b), the overall variance explained by the model is around 67% (adjusted R2  = 0.67). This value of goodness-of-fit is 7% points more than the OLS model (Tables 2 and 3 ). Secondly, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) value in the case of GWR model is relatively smaller than the AIC value for the OLS model (∼818 and ∼832, respectively). While the model with a smaller AIC value is better than the one with a larger AIC value, this 14-point difference between the AIC values of the two models is well above the threshold (cutoff value ≥ 3) generally accepted (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Adjabeng, 2015 ; Jiang & Xu, 2014 ). Similarly, the standardized residual distribution in the case of GWR is relatively closer to normal-distribution than the OLS, which is also reflected by the skewness coefficients for both distributions (i.e., 0.14 and −1.77 for the GWR and OLS models, respectively). This near-normal distribution of the standardized residuals from the GWR ascertains that the model is less biased in comparison with the OLS. Lastly, as the OLS model does not consider the spatial variations in the estimation of parameters, it is unable to adequately represent the actual situation regarding the cross-regional relationship in different districts. On the other hand, the GWR comprehends this shortcoming of the OLS via considering the geographical variability in the data. For these reasons, it is reasonable to say that the GWR is a relatively better choice to model the EdS and its several determinants as it performs better than the OLS model.   4 Discussion Given the fact that initiatives to provide quality education are globally well recognized as integral to achieving SDGs (Beeharry, 2021 ; Parikh et al., 2015 ; UNESCO, 2012 ), it is important to focus on strengthening primary education status of a country. In connection to this, effective utilization of funds is required for the provisioning of quality education as well as to improve the overall educational system. The availability of quality education to every child without discrimination ultimately helps in improving economic growth and socio-political stability of nations (Clément & Piaser, 2021 ; Fujihara and; Ishida, 2016 ; Khan, 2018 ; Vidyattama et al., 2019 ). To drive the effective utilization of funds and resources in the context of quality education, it is imperative to analyze the spatial disparities in EdS and conduct cross-regional assessments, such as provided in this study. The application of GIS and production of thematic maps presented in this study are particularly helpful for effective communication of the results in the context of area-specific decision-making and resource allocation. For instance, the analyses provided here are progressively helpful in identifying key priority areas for immediate or gradual actions via policy implications and resource allocation to districts with lower EdS (i.e., low performing districts in Figs. 2 and 4 ). One significant finding in this study is the spatial disparity among regions regarding EdS (Fig. 2 ). Though it is unrealistic to assume that there would be no variation in terms of EdS of different areas, the clustering of higher performing districts indicates clearly that certain areas in Pakistan have advantages when it comes to primary education (Fig. 4 b). This spatial inequality represents an uneven opportunity for children attending schools in low-performing districts (i.e., the group in yellowish shade in Fig. 2 b and cold-spots identified in Fig. 4 b). While the inferior EdS of districts in Balochistan province (Fig. 2 ) could be justified due to its lowest per capita gross domestic product (US$657) in Pakistan, the lower performance of Sindh province despite having the highest per capita gross domestic product in the country (US$3400) is alarming. This lower performance in Sindh province could be attributed to inadequate measures taken for poverty reduction, school infrastructure improvement, and provisioning of access to electricity (Fig. 3 ). However, further in-depth evaluation at provincial scale is recommended to ascertain the actual reasons—presenting an important research question for future studies. Another important contribution of this study is in terms of modelling approach. For instance, the GWR method is proved to have more potential than the typical OLS regression approach. Likewise, the performance of the GWR model from this study turns out to be much better than the one previously proposed by Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, and Adjabeng (2015) , who modeled the driving factors of education achievement in Ghana using eight exploratory variables in the GWR model. The better performance of our proposed model is well evident from the variance explained by the both models (i.e., 67% in this study versus 28% in Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Adjabeng, 2015 ). Additionally, the model in this study uses a smaller number of explanatory variables, making it more robust and relatively easier to apply in other regions where data availability is a major issue (i.e., developing countries). Our results also indicate that in Pakistan, urbanization level is a statistically significant factor behind the EdS of a district (94% confidence, Table 2 ), and the localized coefficients show that through there are spatial inconsistencies, the indicator is a strong predictor of EdS for all the districts (i.e., positive coefficient values for every district) as presented in Fig. 5 g. This situation represents that due to the availability of resources, good amenities, and better infrastructural facilities, the urban dwellers in Pakistan are at advantage as compared with rural areas. This situation is different than Ghana (a developing country in Africa) as reported in Ansong et al. (2015) , who found urbanization as an insignificant variable for academic achievement. Fig. 7   communicates spatial references regarding the bivariate relationship between EdS and several statistically significant factors. It is clearly evident that the situation in northern Punjab is better whereas in Balochistan it is worst. These spatial references provide opportunities to design effective action plans in order to improve the EdS in Pakistan, and thereby achieving the SDG-4 more effectively. For instance, most of the districts in Balochistan are facing higher poverty (the value of indicator is reversed to make the relation direct) and lower EdS highlighting the urgency to take measures. In contrary to this, the situation in Punjab (particularly in the northern districts) is reverse as poverty is low and EdS is higher. Similar can be observed for other significant factors with varying geographical distributions. 4.1 Implications for policy and SDGs As SDG-4 is among the category 1 of the national prioritized SDGs agenda in Pakistan (Ministry of Planning Development & Reform, 2018 ), which require rigorous measures and immediate interventions through policy and planning (Ansong, Ansong, Ampomah, & Adjabeng, 2015 ; Giangrande et al., 2019 ; Varughese & Bairagya, 2020 ), the multi-dimensional spatial heterogeneities presented in this study are useful to prioritize several regions for immediate or gradual measures. For example, the districts identified as the lower EdS in Fig. 2 b (districts in yellow shade) and the cold-spots in Fig. 4  need immediate attention and measures from the representative authorities. Furthermore, the identified significant explanatory variables could also provide references for decisions and policy interventions to make the EdS of these districts (Tables 1 and 2 ). The significant association between EdS and several explanatory variables shows the interconnectedness between different SDGs as well (Asadikia et al., 2021; Bali Swain & Ranganathan, 2021; Wang et al., 2020 ). For example, one of the statistically significant variables from the global OLS model is poverty, which is a potential indicator of SDG-1 (No Poverty). Hence, in order to improve the EdS towards the achievement of SDG-4, Pakistan also needs to improve the achievement status of SDG-1. This can be effectively achieved via prioritizing the districts with lower EdS (i.e., the regions in group 2 of Fig. 2 b and the districts identified as the statistically significant low-low clusters by LISA in Fig. 4 ). Similarly, the spatial disparities in educational status presented in this study also signal out the geographical differences to achieve SDG4 (Wang et al., 2020 ), as educational status is a potential proxy to monitor SDG4 achievement. Hence, the results presented here are useful to plan initiatives and strategies to boost SDG4 achievement prioritizing the low performing districts and working on the identified significant factors. Given that fact that the education is integral to strengthen the social capital of community resilience in Pakistan and beyond (Sajjad, 2021 ), improving significant determinants of EdS identified in this study and prioritizing the low performing districts can progressively contribute towards building resilient communities in the face of global change—supporting SDG13 (Climate Action) achievement. This further compliments how improving EdS of different regions can not only benefit SDG4 achievement but also help achieving other SDGs due to their interlinkages as highlighted by Bali Swain and Ranganathan (2021) .  4.2 Limitations and the way forward Though the core objective of this study is to evaluate the geographic patterns of EdS and its determinants in Pakistan, the study has few limitations. One of the key limitations is regarding the data availability. For example, it was not possible to include all of the districts in Pakistan in the analyses due to unavailability of the data on the exploratory variables at the scale of this study. The two major concerns for this data limitation are the hampering of data collection in many areas of Pakistan due to several security concerns, and in some areas the districted are newly created. Similarly, the data used in this study are from 2017 and the nature of the performed analyses is static. Whereas, due to change in policies and the boundaries of districts for administrative purpose, the EdS becomes spatio-temporally dynamic issue. In light of this, the present assessments act as the benchmark to conduct national scale district level evaluation. Similarly, while the spatial aspects are well evaluated in this study, the temporal dynamic is yet to be analyzed, which represents an interesting research question for future studies. Similar analyses could be performed when the new data becomes available and the results could be compared with the ones presented here to see the differences. These further assessments can provide opportunities to analyze the effectiveness of adopted policies and strategic action plans devised to improve the EdS. In addition to this, future studies might also consider fitting other latest models (i.e., spatial lag model, multivariate regressions, machine learning, and Forest-based Classification and Regression approaches) to have more insights regarding this problem. Such application might help understanding if these approaches outperform OLS and GWR models in the case of Pakistan and other regions. In addition, though selected based on literature and the availability of data at the scale of our study (i.e., district), the number of explanatory variables used in this study are lower as the multi-collinearity needs to be addressed among the explanatory variables. This situation could have limited the opportunity to capture the direct association between several other variables to determine the EdS. Hence, other set of variables within the domains of socio-economic, capacity building, and institutional development could also be tested after checking their multicollinearity to expand our understanding regarding the controlling factors of education status in Pakistan and beyond. Such assessment could progressively allow regional comparisons of controlling variables to see if the same conditions are driving education status in regions with similar socio-economic, and institutional conditions (i.e., Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, etc.). Nevertheless, the presented approach, results, and implications of this study are noteworthy despite the above-mentioned limitations.   5 Conclusion Despite its importance, education in Pakistan has not received its deserved due attention as the country struggles to cope with manifold challenges. This study empirically fills the knowledge gap regarding geographical heterogeneities in EdS and its significant determinants in a spatial context in Pakistan. To do so, several geo-information models have been employed and inequalities in education status across the region are specifically identified to support actions in the context of SDG-4 achievement in Pakistan. The integration of cartographic outputs, evaluations of spatial association, and identification of significant influencing factors from socio-economic, spatio-environmental, and infrastructural domains provide interesting results. First, a large geographic disparity is evident in the EdS of districts in Pakistan with districts in Punjab province being relatively better as compared to other provinces. Based on the results, rigorous measures in Balochistan province are recommended to improve the situation of education status. Second, while a positive spatial autocorrelation is evident in the EdS across districts, the hotspots (clusters of higher performance) of higher EdS are identified in northern districts in Punjab (95% confidence). Third, based on the multivariate machine learning-based analysis, the statistically distinct (95% confidence) low-performing group is facing larger poverty and lacks particularly in school infrastructure and accessibility to electricity. Among seven potential factors, four are statistically significantly associated with EdS in Pakistan including school poverty (negative association), urbanization level, access to electricity, and infrastructure—ordered in high-to-low association. Thus, focusing these factors particularly in low performing districts is imperative to improve the situation of EdS in future. In a nutshell, the present study provides valuable acumens for better primary education planning in Pakistan based on systematic integration of spatial information modelling, regression, and cartographic techniques. Conclusively, this study presents location intelligence-based district level important insights and valuable references to support Pakistan's efforts to meet the 2030 Targets of SDG-4 in particular and other SDGs in general.
