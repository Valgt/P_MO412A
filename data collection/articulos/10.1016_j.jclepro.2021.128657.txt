                  Since the declaration of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, countries have begun developing and strategizing their national pathways for effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The sustainable development targets set out how the world’s nations must move forward so that sustainable development is not an ideal vision but a workable, comprehensive environmental, economic, and social policy. This work aims to analyze the state of progress towards achieving sustainable development goals for each country. In addition to the static presentation of the achievements that countries can present, the changes over time are also compared, allowing countries to be grouped according to the current states. A sophisticated SDG performance measurement tool has been developed to support this analysis, which automatically processes the entire UN Global SDG Indicators database with exploratory data analysis, frequent item mining, and network analysis supported. Based on the trend analysis of the percentiles, the values of the indicators achievable by 2030 are also derived. The analyzes were performed based on the time-series data of 1319 disaggregated official SDG indicators.
                  Most of the world countries have achieved the greatest success in SDG12 and SDG10 since the declaration of the 2030 Agenda. In the field of climate change (SDG13), 26 countries can count on significant achievements. However, SDG6, SDG2, and SDG1 face significant challenges globally, as they have typically seen minor progress in recent years. Examined at the indicator level, indicators 1.4.1, 5.6.2, 6.b.1, 10.7.2, and 15.4.2 improved in all countries of the world, while indicators 2.a.1, 9.4.1, 2.1.1, 2.1. and 12.b.1 have deteriorated predominantly. According to the forecast for 2030, Australia and the United States can reduce their per capita

Handling Editor: Jiri Jaromir Kleme Since the declaration of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, countries have begun developing and strategizing their national pathways for effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The sustainable development targets set out how the world’s nations must move forward so that sustainable development is not an ideal vision but a workable, comprehensive environmental, economic, and social policy. This work aims to analyze the state of progress towards achieving sustainable development goals for each country. In addition to the static presentation of the achievements that countries can present, the changes over time are also compared, allowing countries to be grouped according to the current states. A sophisticated SDG performance measurement tool has been developed to support this analysis, which automatically processes the entire UN Global SDG Indicators database with exploratory data analysis, frequent item mining, and network analysis supported. Based on the trend analysis of the percentiles, the values of the indicators achievable by 2030 are also derived. The analyzes were performed based on the time-series data of 1319 disaggregated official SDG indicators. Most of the world countries have achieved the greatest success in SDG12 and SDG10 since the declaration of the 2030 Agenda. In the field of climate change (SDG13), 26 countries can count on significant achievements. However, SDG6, SDG2, and SDG1 face significant challenges globally, as they have typically seen minor progress in recent years. Examined at the indicator level, indicators 1.4.1, 5.6.2, 6.b.1, 10.7.2, and 15.4.2 improved in all countries of the world, while indicators 2.a.1, 9.4.1, 2.1.1, 2.1. and 12.b.1 have deteriorated predominantly. According to the forecast for 2030, Australia and the United States can reduce their per capita C O  2      emissions, while some countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East are expected to increase their emissions.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals  Adaptation pathways  Frequent itemset mining  Distribution of the SDG indicators    1 Introduction The history of sustainable development goals (SDGs) goes back a long way (Desa et al., 2016 ), especially to Brown’s work (Brown, 1982 ) in the ’80s. The concept of sustainable development was defined by the United Nations in the 1987 Brundtland Report (Keeble, 1988 ). In Rio de Janeiro (1992), 178 countries adopted the Agenda 21. In September 2000, the leaders of the countries met in New York and unanimously adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were defined to eradicate poverty by 2015 (Sachs, 2012 ) and to improve the basal civilizational standards. For the SDGs to live up to their hopes, countries need to develop measurable and objective adaptation pathways. To follow the achievement of ambitious 17 SDGs and 169 SDG targets, the United Nations (UN) declared the set of the SDG indicators (231 unique indicators). This research aims to find out where the world’s countries are on the road to sustainable development based on the data available for the declared indicators. The question arises as to whether the SDGs can be achieved in the remaining time (until 2030) and can the same expectations be set globally for everyone? For each country to be as close as possible to achieving sustainable development goals, it is necessary to identify the development areas that these countries should focus on in the coming years. Earlier scientific studies have shown that complex relationships between goals and targets make it easier or even more challenging to achieve the SDGs. It was shown that achieving social goals has higher environmental impacts (Scherer et al., 2018 ). Political integration should be based on a better description of biophysical, social, and economic systems (Le Blanc, 2015 ). Defining key strategic goals that vary from country to country can help set priorities at the planning stage (Xin Zhou, 2017 ). An essential feature of SDG indicators is that they have a limited number of observations (Ospina-Forero et al., 2019 ), which is a significant problem even with the analysis of time series data (Dörgő et al., 2018 ). Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), or linked models, are suitable for understanding complex dynamics, but further research is needed (van Soest et al., 2019 ). This research allows for model integration through data, which contributes to future studies of the field. It follows from the interconnectedness of goals that better results can be achieved for all goals due to network effects than if there were no connections between them. This is the systems perspective (Dawes, 2019 ). A typical example of this is the use of coal to improve energy supply (SDG7), which undermines SDG13-14 and can exacerbate air pollution and health (SDG3) damage (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). SDG2, SDG3, SDG7, and SDG14 mainly show synergies with the other goals (Griggs et al., 2017 ) and can free up a significant amount of resources (3% of Côte d’Ivoire’s gross domestic product) (Pedercini et al., 2019 ). The developments needed to reach the SDGs will require additional energy, increasing about 16 million GJ for Chile. This growth is a general feature of sustainable development goals, so monitoring the system’s interrelations and development processes is essential (Simsek et al., 2020 ). To reduce poverty in poor economies, between 2000 and 2016, the net change in welfare was 20% lower than the welfare estimate of per capita poverty reduction (Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ), which can be attributed to trade-offs and synergies of the SDGs. Another vital system feature is that limiting climate change, reducing inequalities and responsible consumption are key barriers to achieving the 2030 Agenda. Focusing on poverty eradication and reducing inequalities will positively affect all sustainable development goals (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019 ). Decision-makers need to think systematically about the interactions between different sustainable development goals (Nerini et al., 2018 ) to keep the 2030 Agenda “sustainable”. At a national level, the idea of links between different goals and political integration can be subject to divergent interpretations (Tosun and Leininger, 2017 ), so comprehensive and objective evaluation methods need to be developed, to which this methodological development has been developed. The identification of emerging patterns resulting from the interaction of SDGs (Zelinka and Amadei, 2019a ) is also key. This type of pattern is also nation-specific citepsebestyen2019network. The grouping of countries based on SDG has therefore been set as the main task in this research. Policy documents such as Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) show a similar pattern (Sebestyén et al., 2019 ), so a joint assessment of the current state and developments is recommended to evaluate the adaptation pathways of the countries. Analysis of the impact of political or economic interventions (Zelinka and Amadei, 2019b ) is necessary for successful implementation. Contextualization of the global targets and comparing global goals and indicators to regional and national priorities and circumstances is essential (Allen et al., 2019 ) for sustainability. Therefore, it has been set as a research goal to present the pattern of SDGs globally and nationwide. Waste management does not appear directly in the 2030 Agenda but can be linked to 3, 6, 8, 12, and 13 SDGs. The Industry 4.0 technology offers promising opportunities, but it should be emphasized that this option will be more likely to lag further behind in countries with lower maturity levels (Fatimah et al., 2020 ). The use of Industry 4.0 technologies is warranted in the sustainable management of the supply chain, especially in logistics and the allocation of resources between high-income and low-income countries (Gusmão Caiado et al., 2018 ). Environmental upgrading affects Global Value Chains, it has positive effects at the national level but adverse effects at the sectoral level, which is also reflected in the field of SDG, with favorable prospects for goals 7 and 12 and unfavorable outlook for goals 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15 (Navarrete et al., 2020 ). Simultaneously, the Global Value Chain approach is key to meeting a high level of sustainability. Consciously linking the private sector and corporate sustainability to SDGs supports the achievement of global goals. Examining CSR programs to support and coordinate the country’s SDG goals must be performed (Gunawan et al., 2020 ). However, coordination of local policymakers is essential for this, as companies focus on a specific group of goals (Ike et al., 2019 ). Foreign direct investment as a source of external financing for the private sector has a positive impact on infrastructure, clean water, wastewater treatment, and renewable energy. Still, it can conflict with climate goal (Aust et al., 2020 ). The digital paradigm application is unavoidable as misunderstandings of SDGs complexities and interconnections can be found in the literature. By providing new data sources and increased analysis capacity, these problems can be bridged (Del Río Castro et al., 2021 ). When designing interventions, the SDG system’s context must be taken into consideration to exploit the synergies and trade-offs in the SDG system. To judge the successes in SDGs, a state assessment of the world’s countries is needed. Furthermore, suppose not only the current state is analyzed, but also the speed of change is considered. In that case, realistic targets can be formulated for the countries/groups of countries. Official SDG data from all countries of the world are used to describe the status. Empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) are defined for each indicator, and all data have been used since the publication of the 2030 Agenda (2015). Based on this, the current status (based on percentile classification) of the countries can be identified. Because ECDFs are scale-independent and contain time series, the effectiveness of progress towards sustainability can also be measured. Lior et al. (2018)  conducted a three-pillar comparative analysis for Southeast Europe. Their gross domestic product (GDP)-based, Beyond-GDP-based, and SDG-based evaluation includes 20 different general macroeconomic indicators for each approach. The method generates unweighted/weighted rank from normalized data (Lior et al., 2018 ). It should be pointed out, there is no widely accepted objective measurement technique, and the relative position of the countries depends on the chosen method (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ). The importance of using integrated assessment tools with a greater focus on human development and the resolution of the model at the national level to better understand how they work in the interactions and evolution of different systems has been demonstrated (Moyer and Bohl, 2019 ). This can be substantiated by exploring country-specific adaptation pathways, which is the core concept of this proposed approach.  2 Methods As shown in Fig. 1 , the method starts with exploratory data analysis. In the first step, each indicator’s empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) are determined for the entire study period. The indicator-level analysis can be aggregated, making the countries comparable at the target or goal level, all with the most complex scope published so far in the field of SDG performance measurement. In the second step, the ECDFs are used to determine which quartile the country belongs to according to the given indicator. Based on the data, empirical distribution functions can be generated, which provide many possibilities that have not been studied so far. Based on these, we can identify the SDG status of countries and also determine the speed of the changes in the indicators. In light of the distributions, it can also be determined whether a country has significantly developed or deteriorated for a given indicator. In the third step, regression models are used to look ahead to determine the expected value of the indicators in 2030 based on the adaptation pathways so far. In the fourth step, frequent items are mined to determine the countries at the same level of development and following the same adaptation path and the indicators developing in the same direction. Interpretation of results is supported by a network analysis toolkit. The research is conducted in the spirit of open science, and the source codes and data are available on the researchers’ website.  As shown in Fig. 1 , the proposed SDG data analysis framework has two main contributions. On the one hand, it can show which countries have achieved the greatest successes in which SDGs and face the greatest challenges, and on the other hand, it is possible to predict how far the nations of the world have the opportunity to reach 2030. It is essential to highlight that the proposed methodology belongs to the family of evidence-based decision-making supporting tools and will be published as an open-source tool to support further scientific findings. 2.1 Preprocessing and selection of the SDG indicators The indicators of sustainable development goals were analyzed based on the United Nations SDG Global Database (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2020 ), available on https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/ . The UN has defined 247 indicators for which data is available in disaggregated form. Therefore, in theory, the number of unique indicators describing sustainable development goals is much higher (1319). The authors agree with Miola and Schiltz (2019) that there is a jungle of indices and indicators to measure SDG performance (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ), nevertheless, after the data treatment, it can be seen that the redundancy of data is very high in the databases. Most of the indicators in the UN database are available in disaggregated form (for age groups, training levels, industries, rural/urban ... etc.), and the availability of these detailed data is relatively low, which makes the analysis and the identification of prediction models extremely challenging. One of the research aims is to measure and evaluate the SDG performance of countries and explore adaptation pathways that require time-series data to be considered. The data of the indicators are selected from the UN SDG database (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2020 ) starting from the year 2010. By preprocessing the data, a matrix can be produced for each country with rows of indicators while columns represent annual data. Exactly as many matrices can be constructed as the number of countries analyzed. The three-dimensional data array can be generated by integrating matrix slices of countries. In addition to the redundancy mentioned earlier, the problem of significant data shortage has to be faced. In the preprocessing phase, missing data are avoided by interpolating the nearest neighbor, so for example, if there is no 2015 data for an indicator, it can be derived from 2014. The task is the progress measurement, therefore the discrete variables of type 0–1 (yes/no) have been neglected, because they do not have interpretable distribution functions. Indicators expressed in local currencies have also been neglected as they are not directly comparable (only refers to the indicator 8.5.1.). When the comparability of the countries required, the variables are normalized with the population of the country. For indicators where a distinction is made between rural, urban and total area coverage, the total area is used in all cases. Altogether 1319 indicators are taken into consideration, whose distribution by SDGs is shown in Fig. 2 .  Fig. 2  shows the number of disaggregated unique indicators compared to the total number of indicators in percentage. Fig. 2  illustrates well that SDGs are covered to varying numbers of indicators. It can be seen that SDG5 has the most indicators (261 pcs.), followed by SDG4 (190 pcs.) and SDG3 (171 pcs.), while SDG7 (6 indicators), SDG13 (14 indicators), and SDG9 (23 indicators) are significantly underrepresented. From a data analysis point of view, the limitation of the published measurement and evaluation approaches is that the coverage is very different in geography, SDG and time. The more data points the modeling is performed on, the higher the reliability, so closing the data gaps is a priority (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ), as Schmidt et al. (2017) highlighted.  2.2 Exploratory data analysis To determine the successes and further challenges in SDGs, it is necessary to define the current statuses of the countries. For the SDG state assessment, firstly, the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) of the indicators have been determined, containing the data of every country for every year after 2010. Empirical distribution functions are determined by Kaplan–Meier estimation, for which lower and upper non-simultaneous confidence bounds can be generated by Greenwood’s formula (Cox and Oakes, 1984 ). The ECDF of the proportion of population below the international poverty line (%) can be seen in Fig. 3 .  In Fig. 3 , the distribution function is shown in blue, while the red dotted lines indicate the lower and upper bounds, which were determined based on the 95% confidence intervals. The black dashed line shows how much progress has been made over the period under review, and the red diamond represents the progress available by 2030. Percentile values can be calculated for each country, based on which the ranking of countries by indicator can be formed. As the empirical distribution functions contain all the nations’ annual data, it is also possible to measure progress. One of the main contributions of the proposed SDG analysis methodology is that countries’ development is not measured through data changes, nevertheless, it uses the derived percentile values for the evaluation. This is advantageous because distribution functions can be generated from the data, where the percentiles can be transformed back to data format. Therefore, the successes or challenges of a country can be tracked through percentile changes. A simple linear extrapolation can also be used to estimate the development rate, which can be used to show how many percentiles a given country will be in 2030 for a given indicator. The degree of development can be measured independently of the scale, and the nominal value of the indicator can also be recalculated based on the percentile values. Fig. 3  shows the development of Sierra Leone with a black dashed line. While in 2010 the proportion of the poor population was around 53%, by 2020, it had decreased to around 40%. Using the speed, it can be shown that by 2030, a value of around 27% can be reached.  2.3 Frequent itemset mining of states of national adaptation paths Empirical distribution functions show the development of countries by indicator, and are even suitable for estimating and predicting the rate of development. If all ECDFs are analyzed together, it is possible to identify biclusters of indicators and countries based on frequent item mining. This methodology development responds to the research gap described by Singh, where understanding of SDGs achievement in the context of global change allows the identification of strategic policy directions, which means the use of strategic and evidence-based advances (Singh, 2020 ). The following six states have been defined to characterize the SDG performance and direction of development of the countries according to the k  th indicator: • i  k , 1    : The indicator is located in the first quartile (Q1).  • i  k , 2    : The indicator is located in the second quartile (Q2).  • i  k , 3    : The indicator is located in the third quartile (Q3).  • i  k , 4    : The indicator is located in the fourth quartile (Q4).  • i  k , 5    : The indicator has been improved significantly.  • i  k , 6    : The indicator has been decreased significantly.    One of the main contributions of the proposed methodology is that the adaptation paths are represented by frequent itemsets of the above-defined states. The key concept of this method is briefly presented as follows. The system of k = 1 , … , N  c      indicators, where N  c     represents the number of indicators, defines a set of items I = { i  1 , 1   ,  1 , 2   , … , i  N c , 5   , i  N c , 6   }    . Each country can be characterized by the quartiles of its indicators and the related development directions. The set of these states can be considered as transactions, similarly to market basket analysis when given a customer buys a set of items. In the following, these sets of transactions are denoted as T  j   ⊆ I   , when j = 1 … , n   , represents the indices of the countries where n   represents the number of countries. The set of these transactions define the transformed D = { T  1   , T  2   , … , T  n   }     database of the SDG indicators. Based on this representation, it is possible to discover frequent sets of states of SDG indicators and countries that support them. The frequent itemsets are selected based on their support (Fournier-Viger et al., 2017 ) (in our case, how many countries are characterized by a given set of states of the indicators), so the analyst can determine the minimum support for which the SDG adaptation path can be considered to be frequent. (An itemset is frequent if its support is more than or equal to some threshold minimum support.) As classical frequent itemset mining (FIM) algorithms generate several itemsets that are difficult to interpret, the maximal frequent itemsets are searched where an itemset is maximal frequent if none of its supersets is frequent (Fournier-Viger et al., 2017 ).  2.4 Similarities of the countries and the indicators As mentioned, the frequent patterns of the development paths are supported by different sets of countries. Based on the overlap of these subsets, the similarities of the nations can be determined. The proposed measure of similarity has previously been successfully used by the authors to compare Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) objectively, so the methodology is not presented in detail here (Sebestyén et al., 2020 ). Based on the supports of the itemsets that contain two states of the SDG indicators, a weighted network is formed, where the nodes of the network represent the indicators and the edge weights represent how many countries show similar development stages or development directions according to the connected two indicators.   3 Results and discussion This section presents SDG indicators that often fall into the same quartile (Section 3.1 .), which implies similar macroeconomic behavior, and should be addressed together in sustainability strategies. In Section 3.2 , the SDG indicators are grouped according to the characteristic direction of their development. Following the presentation of the most typical global trends, SDG’s successes and challenges in the world’s countries are presented in an aggregated way, based on which in Section 3.3 ., countries are grouped according to the extent to which they follow similar adaptation paths. 3.1 Analysis of the states of the development paths Thanks to the proposed method, the current SDG status of countries can be presented through frequent itemsets of quartile classifications (Q1: very high, Q2: high, Q3: low, Q4: very low). Based on this representation, it can be shown which countries have achieved similar success in which indicators and which countries are lagging in similar areas. There are groups of indicators that are specific to countries around the world. By using FIM, 272 frequent itemsets of development status were defined (with minimum support 20%), of which 166 contain one indicator, 54 have two indicators, 45 contain three, 4 contain four, and 2 include five indicators. Thirty-seven countries are in the highest quartile in “under-five mortality rate (3.2.1)” and “neonatal mortality rate (3.2.2)”. In these countries, “Health worker density and distribution (3.c.1)” is low, and “access to electricity (7.1.1)” and “population covered by a mobile network (9.c.1)” are the lowest. The analysis, therefore, also shows the relations between the indicators. The main novelty in this approach is that the relations were generated with FIM from the time series data of all the countries of the world. For example, in 38 countries, both “Parity indices (4.5.1)” and “Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services (6.2.1)” are high. Where “Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems (1.3.1)” is low, there “Health worker density and distribution (3.c.1)” is also low. Or where “Proportion of schools with accesses (4.a.1)” is very low, the “Proportion of population covered by a mobile network” is also typically deficient. The “Number of science and/or technology cooperation agreements and programs between countries (17.6.1)” also shows low quartiles in 37 countries, and the indicator “Proportion of individuals using the Internet (17.8.1)” is the same. Fifty-three countries are in the lowest quartiles for the indicators “Proportion of countries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment (5.c.1)”. Forty-five countries fall into the very high category “Death rate due to road traffic injuries (3.6.1)”. For 47 countries, the “number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster per 100,000 people (1.5.1 & 11.5.1)” and the “number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies (13.1.1)” indicators are also in the low quartile.  3.2 Analysis of the frequent development directions The significant increase and decrease based on FIM can show similar development/adaptation paths of the countries. A total of 352 development patterns were identified, of which six related to one indicator, 70 to two indicators, 159 to three, 97 to four, and 20 to five indicators. For 49 countries, if the “Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff (10.a.1)” increased significantly, then “Under-five mortality rate (3.2.1)” and “Neonatal mortality rate (3.2.2)” decreased significantly, and it was also a significant increase in “International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity and health emergency preparedness (3.d.1)” and “Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology (9.c.1)”. Thirty-six countries where it has succeeded in reducing “Under-five mortality rate (3.2.1)” and “Age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older (3.a.1)” there have increased the “Proportion of adults (15 years and older) with an account at a bank or other financial institution or with a mobile-money-service provider (8.10.2)” as well. Thirty-six countries have increased the “Parity indices (4.5.1)”. “Number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population (16.2.2)” also decreased in 36 countries, while “Number of new HIV infections per 1000 uninfected population (3.3.1)” also decreased significantly in 42 countries. Countries that have succeeded in increasing the “Proportion of the population living in households with access to basic services (1.4.1)” have typically increased the “Proportion of the population with access to affordable medicines and vaccines on a sustainable basis (3.b.1)” and “International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity and health emergency preparedness (3.d.1)”. These countries have also been successful in the “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments and local governments (5.5.1)” and “Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff (10.a.1)” and reducing the “Under-five mortality rate (3.2.1)”. The willingness to pay (WTP) method can show that changes in SDG indicators, including interactions, have different welfare effects than looking at changes by indicator alone (Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ). The goal-target-indicator system for SDGs is clearly defined, however, some effects are not included in the criteria system, such as “emerging infectious diseases (EIDs)”, which have a significant impact on adaptation pathways (Di Marco et al., 2020 ). The current coronavirus pandemic (2019-nCoV) has been shown to significantly delay development, however, in the conceptual framework of SDGs, it can only be taken into account through changes in indicator data. Strengthening cooperation between stakeholders is vital. A rapid change in operating methods is needed at the global level, as the continuation of “business as usual” will not bring the relevant, timely, and adequate knowledge required to achieve sustainable development (Dietler et al., 2019 ). Science has a significant role in contributing to the achievement of SDGs, but further work is needed to develop ethical values, take into account the interdependence of sustainability values, align knowledge with social actors and clarify ethical and epistatic values (Schneider et al., 2019 ). Our approach based on objective environmental-, economic-, and social data may contribute to illuminating the connection points of the mentioned stakeholders. Analysis of adaptation pathways indicates that sustainable development goals and targets will not be met by 2030. This finding has been supported by other research on the target of tuberculosis (Merk et al., 2019 ). The change in SDG indicators can be mapped to all countries in the world as a percentage. Fig. 4  shows which indicators are the most successful globally and where the world’s nations face challenges. The figure has been prepared, taking into account the development directions and significant changes that were observed in at least 20 countries are taken into account.  The improvement is expressed as a percentage of the number of countries in the world. That is, where 100%, all countries have improved, where less than 100%, the percentage of improvement and deterioration can be seen. Fig. 4  illustrates that there are sustainability issues that are being implemented properly. Still, some problems can be outlined globally that need more emphasis over the next 10 years. For example, all countries improved in the indicator “Proportion of population living in households with access to basic services (1.4.1)”, “Number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration policies (10.7.2)”, “Mountain Green Cover Index (15.4.2)”, “Number of countries with laws and regulations that guarantee women aged 15-49 years access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education (5.6.2)” and “Proportion of local administrative units with established and operational policies and procedures for participation of local communities in water and sanitation management (6.b.1)”. Indicators “The agriculture orientation index for government expenditures (2.a.1)” and “CO  2     emission per unit of value-added (9.4.1)” have faced challenges in most parts of the world. The successes and challenges of the SDG in the form of a map of the countries of the world are well represented in the form of a map for the next almost 10 years. The most extensive improvements in the countries are shown in Fig. 5 . The color of the nations is the same as the color of the best-improved SDG. To illustrate the progress of small island states, the cutout by Fullman et al. was adopted (Fullman et al., 2017 ). The analysis took into account that if a country is already performing very well or very poorly on an SDG anyway, it has been ignored in examining development.  Fig. 5  shows that countries made significant progress primarily in SDG10 (Reduce inequality within and among countries) and SDG12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns) in 50 and 36 countries, respectively. For African countries, SDG13 (Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts) is still significant, and globally it is the most improved goal in 25 countries. In the case of SDG10, most of the progress can be seen in indicator 10.a.1 (Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff), but some countries (e.g., Finland, Mauritius, Panama, Seychelles) have made massive progress in indicator 10.b.1. There has been a general improvement in the per capita hazardous waste indicator (12.4.2), especially in Suriname, Kiribati, Equatorial Guinea, Lebanon, and Turkey. The exploration revealed is one of the first steps towards changing consumption norms and more sustainable production, the importance of which has been highlighted by Gusmão Caiado et al. (2018) . The pattern of identified SDG successes is in good agreement with the synergies previously explored. However, there is less similarity between challenges and trade-offs (Pradhan et al., 2017 ), which calls for a more accurate understanding of SDG measurement, which is one of the main goals of this research. By the same logic, Fig. 6  shows the weakest progress of countries in the field of SDGs. To illustrate the progress of small island states, the cutout by Fullman et al. was adopted (Fullman et al., 2017 ).  Fig. 6  shows that countries need to make further efforts, especially for SDG4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all) and SDG1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), in 45 and 43 countries, respectively. In the case of indicators related to SDG6, there are significant differences in well-being, the poorer population lags significantly behind, and there is low coverage in services (Hutton and Chase, 2016 ). It is important to highlight that shortcomings in the set and monitoring of SDG6 indicators at a national level have already been highlighted (Guppy et al., 2019 ). The transparency of the SDG 6 indicators has been questioned as the indicators do not show whether progress has been made through centralized pipeline infrastructure or decentralized options in cities (Weststrate et al., 2019 ). It is crucial to emphasize that the harmonization of local, regional and national policies is hampered by the current national scale of SDG reporting. The methodology for measuring, evaluating, and strategy planning SDGs at the settlement level and harmonizing different scale policies is yet to be developed. The importance of evidence synthesis, learning and implementation support, research engagement, and multisectoral coordination is crucial for the successful SDG6 implementation (Setty et al., 2020 ). For Africa, SDG6 remains vital for Agenda 2030, and the remaining ten years are not enough to meet the targets, as there are countries where there are declining trends (Nhamo et al., 2019 ). Sanitation showed synergies with 124 targets in a Brazilian study, which can be grouped into four areas: basic resilience building services, strengthening equity and ownership, reducing pollution, recycling waste, and economic well-being (Diep et al., 2021 ). The hygiene sectoral improvement requires collaborations and investment across the level of governance based on integrated sanitation solutions (Parikh et al., 2021 ). In countries where the challenges of SDG6 are significant, the sustainability of wastewater treatment plants will be an important consideration. During infrastructure development, membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems are favorable, and classical high-rate algal ponds (HRAP) are also preferred over conventional activated sludge (CAS) from an environmental sustainability point of view (Kanchanamala Delanka-Pedige et al., 2021 ). Our results confirm (Fig. 6 ) that Africa needs to mobilize significant resources for success. For SDG1, indicator 1.a.2 (Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health, and social protection)) shows the most negligible development since the declaration of the Sustainable Development Goals, while in the field of education, parity indices (4.5.1) are the most problematic in general. Lamichhane et al. (2021)  examined the sustainable development performance of OECD countries. Based on 90 variables, it was found that SDG8 generally had the highest performance, while SDG 17 had the lowest performance (Lamichhane et al., 2021 ). The difference between our results and the research by Lamichhane et al. is in the number of analyzed indicators, and in this research, the countries were classified based on the progress, not based on the current state. The authors agree that the majority of SDGs were not significantly improved. One of the key players in educational progress is higher education institutions. Implementing sustainable development goals in universities is still in its infancy, which offers an opportunity for countries with insufficient progress in SDG4 (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ). Development within a secure planetary space and burden-sharing for developed countries are needed to ensure a sustainable future. Simulations up to 2050 also demonstrate that food security (SDG2) requires special attention (Philippidis et al., 2020 ), which is also supported by this research (Fig. 6 ) by analyzing big data.  3.3 Similarities of the development paths of the countries In the previous subsections, it was presented which indicators are successful on a global scale, and the best and weakest performances of the countries of the world were also highlighted. Based on frequent itemset mining, the similarities of countries can also be mapped (Fig. 7 ).  Fig. 7  shows which countries are experiencing similar trends. The overall results help to understand the geographical dependence of SDGs better. Interpreting the impacts of SDG implementation – which are caused by the development patterns – is a further challenge for sustainability professionals. Still, the similarities between countries provide an excellent basis for a comparative analysis of future policy activities. In Fig. 7 , developing countries are marked in red, while developed countries are shown in blue. Colored groups indicate countries that are particularly close to each other, as follows: • Purple (This group is most successful in SDG12 and SDG10, least in SDG14 and SDG11): Antigua and Barbuda (ATG), Congo (COD), Iran (IRN), Lebanon (LBN), Saint Lucia (LCA), Madagascar (MDG), Marshall Islands (MHL), Nigeria (NGA), Nicaragua (NIC), Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands (SLB), Suriname (SUR), Tonga (TON), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (VCT), Venezuela (VEN), Yemen (YEM).  • Orange (This group is most successful in SDG12 and SDG10, least in SDG14 and SDG6): Burundi (BDI), Burkina Faso (BFA), Belize (BLZ), Bhutan (BTN), Côte d’Ivoire (CIV), Cameroon (CMR), Cabo Verde (CPV), Ethiopia (ETH), India (IND), Iraq (IRQ), Jordan (JOR), Kuwait (KWT), Morocco (MAR), Maldives (MDV), Rwanda (RWA), Senegal (SEN), Sao Tome and Principe (STP), Eswatini (SWZ), Seychelles (SYC), Timor-Leste (TLS), Uzbekistan (UZB).  • Yellow (This group is most successful in SDG4 and SDG12, least in SDG13 and SDG11): Anguilla (AIA), Bahrain (BHR), Algeria (DZA), Micronesia (FSM), China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKG), Saint Kitts and Nevis (KNA), China, Macao Special Administrative Region (MAC), Montserrat (MSR), Oman (OMN), San Marino (SMR).  • Blue (This group is most successful in SDG13 and SDG10, least in SDG14 and SDG6): Argentina (ARG), Bangladesh (BGD), Belarus (BLR), China (CHN), Costa Rica (CRI), Ecuador (ECU), Ghana (GHA), Gambia (GMB), Indonesia (IDN), Kenya (KEN), Liberia (LBR), Sri Lanka (LKA), Mongolia (MNG), Namibia (NAM), Pakistan (PAK), Paraguay (PRY), Sierra Leone (SLE), El Salvador (SLV), Tanzania (TZA), South Africa (ZAF)  • Red (This group is most successful in SDG13 and SDG1, least in SDG6 and SDG14): Chile (CHL), Kazakhstan (KAZ), Kyrgyzstan (KGZ), Mexico (MEX), Malaysia (MYS), Panama (PAN), Peru (PER), Philippines (PHL), Thailand (THA), Uruguay (URY).  • Green (This group is most successful in SDG10 and SDG12, least in SDG13 and SDG7): Belgium (BEL), Cyprus (CYP), Denmark (DNK), Estonia (EST), France (FRA), United Kingdom (GBR), Greece (GRC), Iceland (ISL), Luxembourg (LUX), Latvia (LVA), Malta (MLT), Poland (POL), Slovakia (SVK).    For the groups, in order to illustrate the differences in the adaptation pathways, the two SDGs where the members of the group achieved the most development and the two SDGs where they will face the biggest challenges in the coming years were indicated in the parentheses. The development patterns of the countries can be represented in the form of a network. Fig. 8  shows indicators that change in the same direction for at least 20 countries. The edges of the network were weighted by the number of countries, while the size of the nodes was plotted based on the weighted degree, and the color shows the communities (Blondel et al., 2008 ) (closely connected groups of targets/indicators) in the network based on the algorithm of Blondel et al. (2008) .  Fig. 8  shows that the indicators “Indicator of food price anomalies (2.c.1)”, “Total resource flows for development, by recipient and donor countries and type of flow (e.g. official development assistance, foreign direct investment and other flows) (10.b.1)”, “Number of parties to international multilateral environmental agreements on hazardous waste, and other chemicals that meet their commitments and obligations in transmitting information as required by each relevant agreement (12.4.1)”, “Official development assistance and public expenditure on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystems (15.a.1; 15.b.1)”, “Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff (10.a.1)”, “Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology (9.c.1)”, “International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity and health emergency preparedness (3.d.1)” and “Proportion of the population with access to affordable medicines and vaccines on a sustainable basis (3.b.1)” develop in the same direction in most countries. The two communities shown in Fig. 8  illustrate indicators that typically change in the same direction, where the boundary condition is that data are available for at least 20 countries. Green and purple communities do not show improvement/deterioration but provide a global overview of SDG indicators. The purple community infer good practical implications for digital medicine innovation policies in vulnerable setups or how tariffs can foster public health through technology forecasting, while the green community infers to the impact of the number of parties to international multilateral environmental agreements on development aid flows and food price anomalies. The characteristics of the 10 most significant nodes in the network of SDG (Fig. 8 ) indicators are presented in Table 1 .  This analysis provides a further deeper interpretation of countries’ sustainability strategies. If there are pairs of indicators that develop very often in the same direction in many countries, the similarity of the measures taken to address them should be further examined. These actions and SDG status change comparisons must be focal points for the rest of the time in the 2030 Agenda. The expected SDG indicator performances of the countries of the world in 2030 were estimated based on a linear trend-based prediction of the percentiles, not on the raw data, therefore the proposed method can address nonlinearities. An example of the predicted states in 2030 is shown in Fig. 9 . To illustrate the progress of small island states and data availability, the cutout by Fullman et al. was adopted (Fullman et al., 2017 ).  Fig. 9  shows that Australia will reduce its specific carbon emissions. A decrease can also be predicted in the United States, but there are countries where CO  2     emissions per capita will increase. For example, in Tajikistan and Mozambique, almost 370%, in Botswana 280% or Lebanon nearly two and a half times. One of the most prosperous countries is Latvia, which can reduce its emissions to nearly 38%, or Tanzania, where the estimated success is to 46%. The variability in data availability has a significant impact on the estimation accuracy of constructed models. As shown in Fig. 2 , some SDGs were represented with very little data in the official UN database. Based on the results achieved in this comprehensive research, it is suggested to raise the following issues for the transition to sustainability: • It is reassuring that sustainable development has become measurable through the UN SDG’s aspirations, but the achievement of these ambitious goals by 2030 is highly questionable based on current progress.  • Comprehensive and objective assessments are needed to cover the full range of official SDG indicators.  • By 2030, continuous data collection and analysis are needed to gain an accurate understanding of the Agenda.  • It should be borne in mind that the lack of data at the national level needs to be addressed and that analyses need to be extended to sub-national (settlement) levels, and that the basis for policy harmonization needs to be established at different levels.  • Exploiting the potential of SDGs goes beyond 2030. Hence, preparations need to start planning a new Agenda suitable for the long-term development of under-represented and problematic SDGs. The new Agenda (e.g., World Development Goals; WDGs) should be based on indicators enriched with knowledge accumulated in different scientific studies.      4 Conclusion An integrated data-driven SDG assessment methodology has been developed based on the innovative analysis of the SDG indicator database of the United Nations. By generating empirical distribution functions of the SDG indicators, the current SDG performances of the countries of the world were determined. Based on the trend analysis of the percentiles the values of the indicators achievable by 2030 were derived. Using frequent itemset mining technique, biclusters of countries and indicators were explored to highlight which countries follow the same adaptation pathways. In other words, the successes achieved so far, and future challenges are worldwide discovered. The proposed methodology allows countries to be clustered based on SDG performance across the available time series of data. The analysis of the states of the indicators shows that most of the countries have achieved success in the indicators of SDG6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all), SDG1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere), while it is needed to focus significantly on SDG5 (Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls), in general. At a country level, the enormous advances are for SDG10 (Reduce inequality within and among countries) and SDG12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns), while SDG6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all) and SDG4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all) are typically the focus of countries around the world for the next almost 10 years. Interestingly, it has been made global progress on water issues (SDG6), but many countries are lagging in the development of this area the most. Linear trend analysis models have estimated the achievable values of the SDG indicators. Latvia and Tanzania will be able to reduce their performance per kgCO  2   / G D P    by 60%, while Tajikistan, Mozambique, Botswana, and Lebanon are expected to increase by 2–3 times. The MATLAB programs and the prepossessed data will be available at the authors’ website to support the detailed, goal-oriented analysis of the adaptation pathways. The results highlight that the world still has a lot of work to do to improve SDG performance, and it is less than 10 years left on the original schedule. Conscious planning for sustainability must continue beyond 2030. Data collection and evaluation must be at the heart of the future. Subnational-level (settlement) SDG assessments and alignment with national strategies need to be developed to accelerate progress.
