                  The recent development of new technologies has enabled the global enhancement of production in numerous industries. This has caused changes in society on the cultural, economic and sociological levels. In 2015, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated by the United Nations (UN), aiming to be achieved by the year 2030. There are a total of 17 SDGs that are concerned with such important areas as poverty, hunger and well-being, gender equality, sustainability or climate change, among others. In this context, the present study explores the role of business associations known as cooperatives in the SDGs and discusses its role in the current resource curse. To this end, a bibliometric analysis using VOSViewer is applied to the dataset of scientific contributions (n = 874 studies) published between 2015 and 2022 in Web of Sciences (WoS). The analysis focuses on co-citation of references and authors, bibliographic coupling and occurrence of keywords in the dataset. The results show and link 8 types of cooperatives with their influence on each of the 17 SDGs. These links are then discussed and analyzed with the main contributions made to date in the literature linked to the current resource curse and future solutions. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications of the study in relation to the state-of-the-art in this field of research are presented.

The recent development of new technologies has enabled the global enhancement of production in numerous industries. This has caused changes in society on the cultural, economic and sociological levels. In 2015, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated by the United Nations (UN), aiming to be achieved by the year 2030. There are a total of 17 SDGs that are concerned with such important areas as poverty, hunger and well-being, gender equality, sustainability or climate change, among others. In this context, the present study explores the role of business associations known as cooperatives in the SDGs and discusses its role in the current resource curse. To this end, a bibliometric analysis using VOSViewer is applied to the dataset of scientific contributions (n = 874 studies) published between 2015 and 2022 in Web of Sciences (WoS). The analysis focuses on co-citation of references and authors, bibliographic coupling and occurrence of keywords in the dataset. The results show and link 8 types of cooperatives with their influence on each of the 17 SDGs. These links are then discussed and analyzed with the main contributions made to date in the literature linked to the current resource curse and future solutions. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications of the study in relation to the state-of-the-art in this field of research are presented.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Resource curse  Cooperatives  Bibliometric analysis  Sustainability    1 Introduction The development of new technologies has enabled boosting global production in many industries (da Silva Dutra et al., 2022 ). This has caused changes in society on cultural, economic, and sociological levels (Li et al., 2022 ). In this context, in 2015, United Nations formulated 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) intended to be achieved by the year 2030. The proposed goals concern such important areas as poverty, hunger and well-being, gender equality, sustainability or climate change, among others (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ; Chien, 2022 ). All these goals are related to actual challenges faced by the humanity, including climate change and its consequences worldwide, overpopulation, as well as the increase in global production (Revesz et al., 2014 ; Lacarcel and Huete, 2023 ). The SDGs were formulated to embody the humanity's commitment to solving the problems caused by unsustainable strategies, disrespect the environment, or pollution caused by human activities (Cordova and Celone, 2019 ). In the paradigm where these 17 SDGs are established as relevant variables for the prosperity of mankind, a particular important role is assigned to business associations known as cooperatives, which are directly linked to certain SDGs (Caballero, 2019 ). Both the increase in production in many industries and the high demand for goods and services have made the industry sector one of the main culprits of the increase in pollution due to manufacturing and logistics-related actions (Pedersen, 2018 ). In this context, the resource curse refers to the paradox in which countries rich in natural resources often experience slower economic growth, weaker institutions, and higher levels of corruption and inequality (Ross, 2015 ; Wang et al., 2023 ). This phenomenon can be linked to the challenges and opportunities faced by cooperatives in achieving the SDGs which increases the originality of the present study. Accordingly, professional industries, including both producers and distributors, have a significant impact on the achievement of SDGs. In the present study, we seek to understand the role of cooperatives and their influence on SDGs. Despite the richness of past work on SDGs (e.g., Allen et al., 2018 ), none of the previous studies used a bibliometric analysis to understand the role of cooperatives and linking them to the SDGs. The originality of the present study lies in that we explore both themes through a bibliometric analysis, which contributes not only to the study of these two issues, but also to methodological development of future studies in this field. More specifically, the three research questions addressed in this study are as follows: (RQ1): What is the role of cooperatives in promoting compliance with SDGs? (RQ2): What are the main SDGs linked to cooperatives? (RQ3): How can cooperatives adopt strategies (e.g., promoting SDGs directly linked to their professional actions? Based on the research questions presented above, the objectives of the present investigation are as follows:⁃ Create knowledge about SDGs and cooperatives;  ⁃ Evaluate the role of cooperatives in SDGs most linked to their actions;  ⁃ Explore the types of cooperatives and their link to the SDGs and the resource curse    To answer the research questions and accomplish the objectives, in the present study, we use an approach known as bibliometric analysis (Linnenluecke et al., 2020 ). This approach focuses on understanding the most relevant authors who have published contributions related to cooperatives and SDGs to date. In addition, we also seek to understand the main sources (journals) that publish information related to cooperatives and SDGs, as well as the main keywords and themes linked to the objectives of the research. To this end, we use the VOSViewer software (Van Eck and Waltman, 2017 ) and computation of a co-citation analysis of references and authors (Ding and Yang, 2020 ), as well as bibliographic coupling (Oyewola and Dada, 2022 ) and occurrence of keywords (McAllister et al., 2022 ). Regarding the main contributions of the present study, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between cooperatives and the United Nations' SDGs. Through exhaustive bibliometric analysis, the present study highlights the various types of cooperatives and their associations with specific SDGs, thus offering valuable insights for future research and practical applications. The study has also identified prominent authors and publications in the field, serving as a useful guide for scholars and practitioners. By linking each type of cooperative to different SDGs and challenges relative to the resources curse, the research facilitates the way for cooperatives to implement effective corporate social responsibility strategies that align with global sustainability objectives. Additionally, the study's findings contribute to the growing body of literature on cooperatives and SDGs, providing valuable information for future research, strategic planning, and policy development. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. After the introduction and the theoretical framework, we present the methodology used in the present study. This is followed by reporting the main results. The results are then discussed and their theoretical and practical implications are analyzed. The paper concludes with conclusions and a discussion of limitations. 1.1 Theoretical framework There are 17 SDGs focused on establishing the prosperity of society on the planet in relation to its future. These goals can be broadly categorized into the following four groups: education, culture, healthcare, and equality (Bexell and Jönsson, 2017 ). It should be highlighted that the role of sustainability is one of the foci for the development and application of this strategy where the planet and the future of society are the main actors (Fisk, 2010 ). Likewise, as illustrated in Table 1  , the categories Economic, Social, Environmental, and Cross-cutting serve as the foundation for the theoretical framework in which the 17 SDGs are organized. Pertaining to the (i) Economic category, it concentrates on economic and sustainable development, comprising initiatives that stimulate economic growth, innovation, diminished inequalities, and responsible consumption and production. With respect to the (ii) Social category, it encompasses objectives aimed at promoting actions that honor societal values while facilitating access to equitable development opportunities worldwide (Chopra et al., 2022 ). The (iii) Environmental category is devoted to environmental preservation and mitigating the detrimental impacts of climate change and unsustainable practices. Lastly, the (iv) Cross-cutting category is concerned with establishing objectives that span multiple areas and interconnect diverse aspects of sustainable development (Wang et al., 2022 ). Overall, the list of 17 SDGs is focused on the corresponding 17 areas linked to the sustainable future of the planet (Vanham et al., 2019 ). The first goal (SDG 1) is linked to poverty. Basically, it strives to end poverty in all its forms. The second goal 2 (SDG 2), zero hunger, is focused on eliminating famine and imposing rules for safe access to food, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture (Bexell and Jönsson, 2017 ). The third objective (SDG 3) is focused on health and well-being, and the aim here is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being at any age (Omisore, 2018 ). Furthermore, the fourth goal (SDG 4) is focused on the quality of education and aims to ensure equitable and inclusive education in all countries. SDG 5 is focused on gender equality, i.e. equality between men and women and empowerment of the female gender (Hák et al., 2016 ). Next, SDG 6 enables clean and healthy water for all by fighting against pollution of the oceans and drinking water. Likewise, the seventh goal (SDG 7) focuses on the development of clean and accessible energy so that any society can access it. As concerns objective eight (SDG 8), it is focused on decent work and a growth economy to promote inclusive professional activities and a sustainable growth economy (Schroeder et al., 2019 ). SDG 9 is focused on industry, innovation, and infrastructure, thus ensuring a sustainable industry that drives innovation (Moallemi et al., 2020 ). Likewise, SDG 10 is focused on reducing inequality through better wages and access to recurring income in many countries. Furthermore, SDG 11 targets the development of sustainable cities and communities so as to make them inclusive, safe, recent, and sustainable in the long term (Chindasombatcharoen et al., 2022 ). SDG 12 is focused on the development of responsible production and consumption that would allow sustainable development in a variety of industries and respect natural sources and their production and exploitation (Giannetti et al., 2020 ). Next, SDG 13 concerns climate and the urgency of combating climate change and its impacts (Codjoe and Atiglo, 2020 ). Another goal, SDG 14, is focused on life underwater to conserve the oceans and seas and reduce pollution and support biodiversity (Virto, 2018 ). Similarly, SDG 15 targets life on earth to protect and promote sustainable terrestrial systems and fight against desertification and degradation of areas rich in biodiversity (Obersteiner et al., 2016 ). SDG 16 aims at peace and justice and strong institutions so that society can be directed and led by institutions ensuring global peace and justice (Biermann et al., 2017 ). Finally, SDG 17 targets establishing new alliances and goals to guarantee the future of the SDGs in the long term. Table 1  presents the 17 SDGs grouped into four major categories (economic, social, environmental, and cross-cutting). 1.1.1 Types of cooperatives Cooperatives are professional associations of voluntary members who join to fulfill their economic, social, and cultural objectives in a common way (Ghauri et al., 2022 ). As organizations, Cooperatives are inspired by controlled democratic systems that perform professional activities (Iliopoulos and Valentinov, 2022 ). Cooperatives tend to organize their members without standardized leadership or departments; instead, each member is democratically responsible for agreeing with the other members on the actions to be undertaken (Rey and Tirole, 2007 ). Similarly, cooperatives distribute the benefits among their members and are open to new members becoming part of said cooperation as long as they support the economic, social, and cultural objectives for which the cooperative was founded (Chungyas and Trinidad, 2022 ). Generally, the common objective is to pursue the benefits of its members (Bretos and Marcuello, 2017 ). However, in the ever-changing market that has to quickly adapt to new technological developments, cooperatives can be broadly classified into six major types (Reed and Hickey, 2016 ). The first type embraces the so-called producer cooperatives . Such cooperatives promote the cooperative itself with their production in various markets. Subsequently, they receive an added value that they then exploit commercially (Tregear and Cooper, 2016 ). These cooperatives are marketed by their own members and seek an optimal price for the products or services they produce. Relevant examples of such cooperatives include farmers, fishermen, artists, and similar types of activities that may result from cooperative members’ own production (Bijman and Wijers (2019) . The second type of cooperatives is consumer cooperatives  that aim to acquire products and services for their members at very low prices. These cooperatives are made up of users who buy products and services or distribute them (Minnehametova et al., 2022 ). In this way, when members register in this type of association, they can obtain these products at a lower price. Consumer cooperatives may have initiatives to purchase products and services, request products and services from third parties, or create their own stores where they make offers to their members (Sadowski, 2017 ). The third type of cooperative is known as worker cooperatives  that are responsible for own employees. The members of such cooperatives have the common goal of creating jobs for their members that, at the same time, can allow control of the cooperative. Members of worker cooperatives invest capital in the cooperative in order to promote a business and share the costs and risks of being the main owners (Thompson, 2015 ). In general, this type of cooperative offers services, such as training schools, social consultancies or food and food collection services, among others, to other businesses (Bastida et al., 2022 ). The fourth type of cooperative embraces the so-called housing cooperatives , which are founded to offer their members affordable prices for access to housing (Ferreri and Vidal, 2022 ). Its members are both homeowners and renters with a democratic responsibility to manage housing spaces. Housing cooperatives can be with or without economic objectives. Sometimes, such cooperatives are founded to support local governments or help the government or other companies that can collaborate with the cooperative (Balmer and Gerber, 2018 ). The fifth type of cooperatives includes finance cooperatives  that focus on offering financial services to their members (Grashuis and Su, 2019 ). In such cooperatives, members offer their own deposits and trust investments in financial products. In this way, all members of finance cooperatives can enjoy the benefits of financial products (Atmadja et al., 2021 ). Next, there are also cooperatives known as new generation cooperatives , which pursue emerging economic objectives. Such cooperatives are linked to industries such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and other similar industries and their members are producers (Walzer and Merrett, 2002 ). In this way, these cooperatives focus on the process and optimization of production to obtain an economic benefit according to the contribution of each individual member. In new generation cooperatives, the number of members is limited and depends on the size of the industry (Grashuis and Cook, 2018 ). Furthermore, the seventh type is multi-stakeholder cooperatives , in which groups of stakeholders create a cooperative to encourage both workers and consumers in a specific sector (Sacchetti and Birchall, 2018 ). In this type of cooperatives, both the members’ own production sources and those of the stakeholders are combined. These types of cooperatives tend to drive sustainability as their main force for the economic value (Michaud and Audebrand, 2018 ). Finally, the eighth type of cooperatives includes non-profit community service cooperatives  that promote services to the community that are not focused on an economic impulse (Fazzi, 2012 ). A common example of non-profit community service cooperatives is care centers for minors or the elderly organized by family members who also use these services in their daily activities (Cooper, 2022 ). Table 2   summarizes the main characteristics of the eight types of cooperatives outlined above.    2 Methodology 2.1 Bibliometric analysis In the present study, we used a bibliometric approach (Donthu et al., 2021 ) to identify the connections between the studies in the sample (Ellegaard and Wallin, 2015 ). Our focus was on understanding the existing links between cooperatives and the SDGs. To define and obtain the sample, the Web of Science (WoS) database (Wang et al., 2014 ). This database includes studies published in reputed international journals with high ranking according to the Journal of Citation Report (JCR). The WoS database encompasses a vast and diverse range of academic disciplines, providing access to a wealth of scholarly literature. Its extensive coverage ensures that researchers can obtain a representative sample for their bibliometric analysis. Also, it should be highlighted that Web of Science database is known for its stringent selection criteria, which guarantees that the indexed journals and publications are of high quality and relevance. Likewise, WoS database provides standardized citation data, enabling researchers to accurately measure the impact of individual publications and journals. This consistency in citation information allows for a more accurate and robust analysis of bibliometric data. Similar studies such as Sarkar et al. (2022)  and Dibbern et al. (2022)  were also used to choose WoS and VOSViewer as the database and software to develop this study. Further detail on the data collection process is provided below. Bibliometric studies were used to obtain quantitative metrics linked to indicators and variables (Van Eck and Waltman, 2017 ). The evolution and development of one or several concepts throughout a certain terminal horizon can be understood via the analysis of major contributions made in the scientific literature (Ding and Yang, 2020 ). This type of approach helps researchers to identify structural and dynamic networks of journals and authors who use the same sources of information to develop their studies (Oyewola and Dada, 2022 ). In this way, in terms of classification and categorization, it is possible to understand the most relevant sources and the most cited authors. As argued by McAllister et al. (2022) , this type of analysis focuses on understanding the state-of-the-art in two or more topics. With this approach, and using the analysis of citations from other studies, one can evaluate scientific rigor, quality, and quantity of publications, as well as their reputational value (Fu and Waltman, 2022 ). Therefore, bibliometric analysis helps to identify an intelligent and intellectual network of main contributors to the development and study of a term. In the present study, we used VOSViewer software which is wide acceptance in the scholarly community and has been extensively used and cited in numerous bibliometric studies across a range of disciplines, attesting to its validity and usefulness as a bibliometric analysis tool (Van Eck and Waltman, 2017 ; Dibbern et al., 2022 ). In this way, three different types of approximations that were computed using the presented software. First, we performed the co-citation analysis, which aimed to identify the references of other publications to create a network of the main works that received a greater relevance in terms of citations (Shen et al., 2022 ). Second, we conducted bibliographic coupling, which is a type of analysis developed to identify common references in a database in terms of journals (sources) that have published the studies related to the themes at stake. Finally, we ran the keyword concurrency analysis where, in broad terms, the main keywords making up the studies were analyzed and identified (Orduña-Malea and Costas, 2021 ). The keyword co-occurrence analysis enabled us to identify the main links and terms in relation to the cooperatives and the SDGs. Based on these keywords, different lines of research were identified, and the most dominant themes were linked to both concepts (Wang et al., 2021 ). In addition, with the co-citation analysis, we identified the authors and classified them by the field of research. In this way, we also identified the journals that published the most studies in our field of research. Similarly, using the co-occurrence analysis of both authors and journals, the most frequent keywords that appeared in the database were represented in the form of neural networks (Ding and Yang, 2020 ). We also measured the weight that one neural network link had with others to determine its relevance (Van Eck and Waltman, 2017 ). Using the VOSViewer software, we visually determined and qualitatively interpreted the results. Likewise, using bibliometric metrics, we identified the most relevant authors and sources of information. The VOSViewer software also allowed us to visualize the results from neural maps, matrices or data tables (Shen et al., 2022 ).  2.2 Data sampling The database used in the present study was WoS, a leading database in the academic industry that has international prestige derived from its classified and indexed journals (Shen et al., 2022 ). In order to extract the data, we reviewed similar studies such You et al. (2021)  and Oladinrin et al. (2022) . Using Boolean operators (AND/OR), we performed queries to obtain relevant results linked to cooperatives and SDGs. The queries were made on November 28, 2022, and the WoS filters “original articles” and “reviews” were used (so that to exclude from the results the findings such as published books, chapters, or proceedings). According to Oladinrin et al. (2022) , introducing filters is a common procedure when working with databases that exceed a proportional size. The query was made in the WoS categories of economics, business, management and business finance: (TS=(sustainable development goals) AND TS=(Cooperatives) OR TS=(SDGs)) AND (TASCA = =(“ECONOMICS” OR “BUSINESS” OR “MANAGEMENT” OR “BUSINESS FINANCE”) AND DT = =(“ARTICLE” OR “REVIEW")) from January 1, 2015 to November 28, 2022. The starting point of publications was chosen because it was in 2015 that the SDGs were approved and published (Aly et al., 2022 ). Of the total of 880 studies obtained, we worked further with 874 studies that directly dealt with the objectives proposed in the present study. Fig. 1   shows the number of studies published on cooperatives and SDGs between 2015 and 2022. The years when the most scientific contributions were published were 2020, 2021 and 2022. In 2022, a total of 255 studies (28.97%) were published, followed by 2021 with a total of 241 articles (27.38%) and 2020 with 179 (20.34%). The number of published studies grew with time as the research on the SDGs and cooperatives gradually expanded from 2015 to 2022. The Y axis is Fig. 1  represents the maximum number of publications up to a total of 26o, while the X axis shows the years (from 2015 to 2022). Furthermore, Table 3   shows the total number of articles selected in the database by the categories. As can be seen in Table 3 , the largest was the economics category, with a total of 350 (39.77%) articles, followed by the business category, with a total of 319 (36.25%) contributions and the management category, with 262 studies (29.77%). Finally, for the business finance category, 99 articles were identified, which equals 11.25% of all articles included in the sample. These results suggest that the economic and business categories were the dominant ones in previous research on cooperatives and the SDGs. Accordingly, economic and business development is the priority in this research. Table 3  also lists the authors with the most citations identified in the database.   3 Bibliometric analysis results In this section, we report the results of co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, and keyword co-occurrence. 3.1 Co-citation analysis With regard to the results of the co-citation analysis, Table 4   shows the 10 studies that obtained a greater number of citations in the analyzed database. The table shows both the studies and the authors of these studies and the year of publication. In this regard, Table 4  presents a list of significant academic articles related to the SDGs and the role of the private sector and businesses in their achievement. The articles are classified based on the number of citations and link strength, indicating the relevance and impact of these works on research in this area, garnering 55 citations and a 39.00 link strength. The most influential article, in terms of link strength and the number of citations, is “The Private Sector and the SDGs: The Need to Move Beyond ‘Business as Usual” by Scheyvens et al. (2016) . This work highlights the importance of changing business practices to achieve the SDGs and emphasizes the need for a more innovative and collaborative approach. The articles by Rosati and Faria (2019 , 2019a)  on business contribution to the Sustainable Development Agenda and the relationship between the SDGs and sustainability reports are also notable in the literature, with 39 citations and 34.00 link strength, and 40 citations and 33.000 link strength, respectively. These works address organizational factors related to the early adoption of SDG reporting and the influence of institutional factors on how businesses approach the SDGs in their sustainability reports. Both studies highlight the importance of disclosure and corporate engagement in promoting sustainability and achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, Le Blanc (2015) , with 49 citations and 33.00 link strength, presents a network approach to the integration of the SDGs, exploring how these goals are interconnected and how they can be more effectively addressed through cooperation and coordination. This work provides valuable insight into how the SDGs can be achieved in an integrated and holistic manner. Additionally, Bebbington and Unerman (2018)  suggest a facilitative role for accounting research in achieving the SDGs, with 45 citations and 33.00 link strength. This article underscores the need to develop accounting methodologies and approaches that enable businesses to assess and communicate their progress in achieving the SDGs. On the other hand, Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018) , with 48 citations and 29.00 link strength, address the commitment of multinational corporations to the SDGs from an institutional perspective, focusing on how multinational companies can contribute to the achievement of these goals. This study provides a deeper understanding of corporate practices and strategies that multinationals can implement to tackle sustainable development challenges. Similarly, Nilsson et al. (2016)  propose mapping the interactions between the SDGs to better understand their connections and synergies, which would allow for more effective and coherent policy implementation. They garner 37 citations and 28.00 link strength. This approach can assist policymakers and stakeholders in identifying priority areas and coordinating their efforts. Furthermore, the articles by Sachs (2012)  and Griggs et al. (2013) , with 38 citations and 34 citations and 23.00 link strength, respectively, offer an analysis of the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the SDGs and discuss how these goals can be effective in addressing social and environmental challenges. These studies provide a robust framework for understanding the historical context and scope of the SDGs. In summary, the articles presented in Table 4  address a wide range of topics related to the SDGs, being the main contributions in the reference co-citation analysis. The articles focus on private sector engagement, the adoption and disclosure of sustainability reports, the interconnection between the SDGs, the role of accounting research, and the commitment of multinational corporations. The authors highlight the importance of collaboration, innovation, and integration in achieving the SDGs and emphasize the need for a holistic approach to tackling sustainable development challenges. The number of citations and link strength of these articles reflect their relevance and contribution to the academic literature in the field of sustainable development. These studies offer a solid foundation for future research and provide valuable guidance for businesses, policymakers, and other stakeholders in promoting and achieving the SDGs. Fig. 2   is a representation that can be analyzed to understand the links and weights of the co-citations of the references. The figure shows the top 10 references computed in the co-citation analysis. To run this author neural network, the minimum number of citations was set at 35 citations. Of the total of 21 references included in this criterion, 13 were included in Fig. 2 . The total number of links revealed by the analysis was 54, with a representation density of 100%. The total link strength considered in the results amounted to 163.50, while the degree was set at 10. Thus, Donthu et al. (2021)  and Tandon et al. (2021) , in the visual representation, only the top 13 results are shown to facilitate the analysis in the three identified clusters. The different labels that appear in Fig. 2  individually represent a reference. Likewise, the size of the letters visually represents the number of times a reference was cited. Accordingly, the references that are at a greater distance are those that were less frequently cited. Bu contrast, for the references that appear closer, there is a greater probability of being to the same reference. In Fig. 2 , a total of 3 clusters were identified. The first, by number of citations, is the one made up of United Nations, Brundtland Groharlem, Va Zanten J.A., Sachs, J.D. and Scheyvens, R. (red color), which are the most relevant reference co-citation clusters in the analyzed database. The second, in blue, is made up of Bebbington, J., Rosati, F. and Rosati, F. This cluster is second in relevance in terms of citations in the database. Finally, the third cluster is formed by Le Blanc D., United Nations and Nilsson, M., which represent the third cluster by weight in relation to the citations identified in the database. Based on the results of the co-citation analysis, we identified the authors with the most citations within the database. Of note, the results of the author co-citation analysis are generally similar to those identified in the reference co-citation analysis. We also computed the link strength (Li and Xu, 2022 ), which is an indicator that explains how relevant the inmate of the referrals is among its connections in relation to the total number of referrals obtained. In relation to the results of references with a greater number of citations, these were for the United Nations, with 413 citations, the World Bank, with 271 citations, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, with 171 citations. These references are from public bodies promoting the development and dissemination of the SDGs; therefore, their weight in the references is directly linked to the different regulations and guides published for their correct implementation and execution. With regard to the authors, Sachs, J.D. with 103 citations, Kolk, A., with 98 citations, and Rosati, F., with 82 citations, are the most cited. The references with the highest relevant link strength were Scheyvens et al. (2016)  with 39.00 and Rosati and Faria (2019)  with 34.00. On the contrary, those references that obtained a lower link strength value were Sachs (2012)  and Griggs et al. (2013) , with this value amounting to 23.00. In order to complete this analysis, the density analysis of the co-citation analysis of author's map was also developed. The filters selected for this analysis were as follows. The minimum number of citations by one author was established at 45. Thus, a total of 35 authors out of a total of 32,251 met this threshold criterion. In this way, a total of 524 links with a 98% density were obtained. Furthermore, a total link strength was 1140.71. Of note, when there were authors with similar names (which could have biased the results), we took this type of discrepancy into consideration. Based on the results, we identified a total of 3 clusters in the density map. In Fig. 3  , a total of three clusters are identified. The center of the clusters is formed by the connections and groups of authors. The most cited authors are represented in red, while the least cited authors appear on the edge of the clusters in green. The most relevant central cluster is the one with the most cited references, such as the United Nations, World Economic Forum, World Bank, European Commission, and OECD. The second cluster is the one with Kolk, A. and Porter, M.E. Finally; while the third cluster is formed by Pizzi, S., Rosati, F. and Bebbington, J.  3.2 Bibliographic coupling of sources In order to analyze different journals that published the most relevant contributions in relation to cooperatives and the SDGs, we performed the analysis known as bibliographic coupling of sources. Using this analysis, it is possible to identify the sources that collect the greatest number of documents, citations, and link strength. In this way, the minimum number of documents published in the same journal was established at 10. Of the total of 312 sources included in the database, 20 met this criterion. Therefore, a total of 45 links with a 100% density were identified. In this analysis, a total link strength of 992.37 was obtained, with the grade of 10. In order not to create any filter in relation to the most current references, the minimum number of citations to be included in the results was 0. Table 5   lists the 10 most relevant references identified in the database. Table 5  shows the list of the most relevant sources in relation to SDGs and cooperatives. The journals with the highest number of contributions were World Development,  with 47, and Technological Forecasting and Social Change,  with 26. The journal that received the most citations was World Development , with 1181. In addition, the journal that obtained the highest link strength was Business Strategy and the Environment,  with a total of 412.80, followed by Corporate Social Responsibility  and Environmental Management  (317.65). The remaining journals present moderated contributions and citations. However, Technological Forecasting and Social Change  stood out with 743 citations, Ecological Economics  with 676 citations, Business Strategy and the Environment  with 432 citations, Corporate Social Responsibility  and Environmental Management  with 369 citations, and Journal of International Business Policy  with 328. The remaining journals had a moderate number of citations. However, Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja  had 11 documents and 55 citations, but a link strength of 117.88, which was close to journals such as Technological Forecasting and Social Change  that had more contributions and citations, but a similar link strength. The first two sources—namely, Business Strategy and the Environment , Corporate Social Responsibility  and Environmental Management —stood out for the link strength obtained; the remaining eight sources had moderate link strength levels. Furthermore, Fig. 4   shows three clusters linked to the themes and the years. The journals that received more relevance in the years 2021 and 2022 were Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja , Journal of Business Research , Journal of Business Ethics . As to the year 2020, the journals that received more relevance were World Development and Ecological Economics . The remaining citations were equally distributed across the analyzed years (2015–2022). Cluster number 1 was made up of Journal of Business Research , Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja , Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management  and Business Strategy and the Environment . The second cluster was formed by Business Strategy and Development , Ecological Economics, Technological Forecasting and Social Change and World Development . The third cluster was formed by the Journal of Business Ethics  and the Journal of International Business Policy .  3.3 Author keyword co-occurrence Based on the results of the analysis of the most relevant keywords identified in the contributions linked to SDGs and cooperatives, Table 6   shows the results obtained in terms of occurrences and total link strength. In addition, Fig. 5   shows the keywords identified in a map of neurons and clusters according to their relevance. The minimum number of occurrences of a keyword was set at 10. Of the total of 3744 keywords, 127 met this threshold. Setting aside SDGs and its initials (“SDG”) (254 occurrences and total link strength 195.00 and SDGs 185 occurrences and 148.00 link strength), the words with the most occurrences were sustainability,  with 128 occurrences, and performance  with 84 occurrences. These two terms were the most frequently repeated keywords. Thus, linking the results to cooperatives, actions linked to business innovation, sustainability impact management, or strategies focused on corporate social responsibility linked to compliance with the SDGs could be identified. In Fig. 5 , five clusters were identified in which the greatest relevance was directly linked to the SDGs. However, important links were also observed in relation to the challenges of COVID-19, the measurement of the impact, and the variables related to its compliance, the importance of innovation, education, and adaptation of business models and their growth, as well as the paper on the economy linked to the impact of the SDGs.   4 Discussion The results of the present study, which focused on the analysis of previous studies on the SDGs and business associations known as cooperatives, revealed the importance of growth, impact, sustainability, and economic development of the SDGs. In the analyzed publications, a particularly salient concept was the circular economy, which focuses on business models or business associations that promote innovation, the fight against climate change or the analysis of the determining factors for a correct performance of strategies. These models are focused on corporate social responsibility that helps cooperatives achieve the SDGs (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ). From the contributions focused on the analysis of governance (Grashuis and Su, 2019 ) to the impact of COVID-19 (Yu et al., 2020 ), the scientific literature is rich and varied and continues to explore the development of effective and sustainable strategies to solve the challenges of managing and applying the SDGs (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2021 ). Contributions focused on entrepreneurship or corporate sustainability were also identified (González-Padilla et al., 2023 ); however, the role of cooperatives can be linked to their typology and the role they determine for compliance with each of the SDGs (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). Table 7   presents eight types of cooperatives identified in the scientific literature, and their direct link to the SDGs is discussed below. Producer cooperatives  were found to be linked to the following SDGs: No poverty (SDG1); Zero hunger (SDG 2); Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), and Life on land (SDG 15). These cooperatives face the challenge of managing resources sustainably to avoid contributing to the resource curse. On the other hand, they can also provide opportunities to mitigate the resource curse by promoting responsible production and consumption, reducing poverty and hunger, and protecting the environment (da Silva Dutra et al., 2022 ). As argued by Bijman and Wijers (2019) , most producer cooperatives are focused on the exploitation of land, which is one of the sustainable natural resources. Likewise, consumer cooperatives  were found to be related to the goals of Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and Industry and Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9), as these cooperatives help consumers in both economic activities and purchasing (Talonen et al., 2016 ; Saura et al., 2021 ). Consumer cooperatives can contribute to alleviating the resource curse by promoting sustainable resource management, innovation, and infrastructure development. However, they may also face challenges in ensuring that their actions do not exacerbate the resource curse by overexploiting natural resources or promoting unsustainable consumption patterns (Talonen et al., 2016 ). It should be highlighted that have as one of their objectives to help consumers who have common objectives linked to the goal of the cooperative. Therefore, their links to the aforementioned SDGs are coherent. Furthermore, in relation to worker cooperatives , they promote the rights of workers in the society and their relationship with the environment. These business associations were found to be focused on Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) and Life below water (SDG 14). This can help prevent the resource curse from taking hold in such industries. Challenges for worker cooperatives may include navigating the balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability while ensuring workers' rights and well-being (Magne, 2017 ). Next, housing cooperatives  are focused on maintaining and disseminating affordable housing for their members (Ferreri and Vidal (2022) . Such actions promotes the objectives of Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) and Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (9), which can offer opportunities to develop sustainable urban infrastructures and housing solutions that minimize the resource curse's impact. However, cooperatives may encounter challenges in sourcing sustainable materials and ensuring that their actions do not contribute to the depletion of natural resources (Ferreri and Vidal, 2022 ). Therefore, their links both in the innovation industry (Saura et al., 2023 ) and infrastructures can be linked to the mentioned SDGs; as indicated by Anwar et al. (2022) , cooperatives are democratic associations that not only oversee implementation of certain rights, promote social work and respect to the environment. Appropriate development of infrastructures in cities and their sustainable exploitation will allow these SDGs to be effectively fulfilled. As to financial cooperatives , these were found to promote the objectives of Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) and Partnerships for the goals (SDG 17). Therefore, financial cooperatives can provide opportunities by supporting sustainable investments and fostering partnerships that address the resource curse. Challenges may include identifying and promoting investments that genuinely contribute to sustainable development while avoiding those that exacerbate the resource curse (Atmadja et al., 2021 ). Likewise, economic growth is essential in global terms, as it promotes decent jobs and the average salary of employees in relation to cooperatives strategies. However, financial cooperatives function in a multitude of industries, which is why they are multidisciplinary and promote not only economic development, but also the philosophy and policies related to growth, which allows their associates to also promote the positive achievement of the aforementioned SDGs (Boland and Barton, 2013 ). Furthermore, as argued by Grashuis and Cook (2018) , new generation cooperatives  can be linked to the objectives of Peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) and Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3) can also offer opportunities by promoting fair governance and innovative approaches to resource management (Saura et al., 2022 ). Such cooperatives not only work with emerging technologies and ideas, but can also promote education linked to new generations of entrepreneurial entrepreneurs. Thus, these cooperatives face challenges in integrating new technologies and ideas that do not inadvertently contribute to the resource curse, while also ensuring that their activities promote well-being and social equity (Grashuis and Cook, 2018 ). Also, one of their tasks linked to the health and well-being industry may be precisely that innovation and technology processes do not create discomfort for new generations that are born and grow up using technology (Lacárcel, 2022 ). New generation cooperatives can undoubtedly play a fundamental role in achieving the SDGs they ensure the ideological and political update of a multitude of industries and business associations that promote economic objectives (Grashuis and Cook, 2018 ). In addition, we can find cooperative multi-stakeholders that can be focused on a multitude of industries and fields and boost an opportunity to address the resource curse by making clean energy accessible to all (Yu et al., 2022 ). In this context, challenges may include coordinating the diverse interests of stakeholders while ensuring that their actions do not perpetuate the resource curse. However, it is interesting to highlight that there are many cooperatives identified in the literature that focus on making clean energy accessible to all (Yu et al., 2022 ). Along with several objectives linked to the SDGs, such as Affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9), and Partnerships for the goals (17), such cooperatives are also linked to the promotion and optimization of the industry innovation and infrastructures because they are business associations whose members tend to support social and sustainable elements, which is a fundamental value for the achievement of SDGs. Finally, non -profit cooperatives  and community services, as indicated by van Zanten and van Tulder (2021)  and Cooper (2022) , are focus on promoting quality in education, training and understanding of gender equality, as well as establish respect for climate actions to fight against global warming. This corresponds to Quality Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5), Climate action (SDG 13), and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10). Likewise, since non-profit cooperatives do not seek economic profit, they can reduce inequalities in many industries, serving as an example to the professional sector of how community services can become a fundamental business model receiving government aid or private investment to ensure sustainable development. Table 7  summarizes the relationships between different types of cooperatives and their links with and roles in the SDGs.  5 Conclusions In the present study, we performed a bibliometric analysis focused on identifying the role of cooperatives in the 17 SDGs. A database consisting of a total of 874 academic contributions published between 2015 and 2022 was compiled. These contributions were then analyzed using a co-citation analysis of references and authors, bibliographic coupling, and keyword occurrence analysis. Based on the results, we linked eight types of cooperatives to 17 SDGs. We also established that, although SDGs were formulated in 2015, major contributions published in recent years indicate that there are still many business associations focused on measuring the impact and determining professional actions linked to the successful achievement of the SDGs. Considering that the SDGs must be effectively implemented and developed by the year 2030, many cooperatives are now adopting strategies and optimizing them to the SDGs. Management of innovation and sustainability and flexibility of business models vis-à-vis circular economy have become the fundamental pillars for a successful application of the SDGs by cooperatives. New forms and models of implementation of circular economy policies and initiatives linked to the SDGs should be thoroughly investigated in the literature to promote the adoption and flexibility of current strategies of cooperatives, which will contribute to a successful attainment of 17 SDGs by 2030. 5.1 Theoretical contributions This study yields several notable theoretical implications. Firstly, it delves into and conceptualizes the primary viewpoints regarding the connections between various types of cooperatives and sustainable development goals (SDGs). These insights serve as a foundation for subsequent research aimed at comprehending and implementing approaches that enable cooperatives to adopt sustainable practices to achieve the SDGs. Moreover, by identifying the most influential authors and highly cited references, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the current state of knowledge in the realm of cooperatives and their relationship with the SDGs. This understanding not only fosters further exploration but also aids in the development of new ideas and research directions. Additionally, by examining the associations between the eight cooperative types and their corresponding SDGs, this study offers a valuable resource for future researchers. This information encourages researchers to engage in discussions and debates around these linkages and to develop theoretical or empirical models that identify significant associations and positive relationships between the variables of interest. Another implication arises from the categorization of the cooperative types and their corresponding SDGs. This categorization offers a framework for future research to delve deeper into the specific mechanisms and processes through which each cooperative type contributes to the SDGs. By examining these mechanisms, researchers can better understand the unique strengths and challenges faced by different cooperative types in promoting sustainable development. Also, the findings may inspire further investigation into the role of cooperative governance structures in achieving the SDGs. Exploring the interplay between governance models, member engagement, and the pursuit of sustainable development objectives can yield valuable insights and knowledge into how cooperatives can effectively balance their social, economic, and environmental goals. Likewise, the development of new methodologies and approaches for assessing the impact of cooperatives on the SDGs is presented as a theoretical implication. By building on the bibliometric analysis presented in this study, researchers can refine their methods for quantifying and evaluating the effectiveness of cooperative actions and initiatives in the context of sustainable development. These advancements in methodology will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role cooperatives play in addressing global challenges and will help to identify best practices that can be disseminated across the sector. This study's findings may also encourage comparative research across different geographical regions and cultural contexts. This comparative perspective can help to uncover context-specific challenges and opportunities, enabling the development of tailored interventions and support mechanisms relative to SDGs and the current resource curse. This interdisciplinary approach can lead to the creation of new theoretical frameworks and concepts that further enrich the academic discourse on cooperatives and the SDGs. Finally, the present study can stimulate a critical scientific reflection on the role of cooperatives in addressing the inequalities and power imbalances that underpin many of the global challenges encompassed by the SDGs and the resource curse. This reflection may prompt researchers to investigate the potential of cooperatives as agents of transformative change, capable of challenging and reshaping existing systems and structures in favor of more equitable and sustainable outcomes.  5.2 Implications for practice The practical implications of the present study offer a multitude of possibilities for cooperatives. By linking each type of cooperative to different SDGs, cooperatives can take this research as a guide to implement their corporate social responsibility strategies. At the same time, by being able to link their professional activities to the different SDGs, cooperative members can clearly determine their sustainable activities by understanding the links between their professional activities and the sustainable strategy of the European Union. Furthermore, the identified results provide cooperatives with an academic guide to the main scientific contributions made to date in this field, which could allow them to improve their strategies in many industries. Also, the potential for increased collaboration and partnerships among cooperatives and other stakeholders, such as governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector is presented as a practical implication. Therefore, by understanding the cooperative types and their corresponding SDGs, these diverse actors can identify areas of shared interest and work together to develop joint initiatives and projects that advance sustainable development objectives. This, can amplify the impact of individual efforts and foster a more coordinated and cohesive response to the challenges posed by the SDGs in the cooperative industry and the future contexts relative to the resource curse phenomenon. Moreover, this research can serve as a valuable resource for policymakers and regulators as they develop policies, regulations, and incentives aimed at supporting the growth and sustainability of cooperatives. Policymakers can tailor their interventions to the unique needs and strengths of each cooperative, sector, maximizing their effectiveness in promoting sustainable development. In addition, policy-makers can engage in dialogue with cooperatives and other stakeholders to ensure that their policies are informed by the latest research and best practices. This collaborative approach between policy-makers and cooperatives can lead to the development of more responsive and targeted policies that effectively support cooperatives in their pursuit of the SDGs while also fostering a conducive environment for innovation and growth within the cooperative movement.  5.3 Limitations The limitations of the present study are linked to possible methodological biases resulting from the use of the VOSViewer software (Van Eck and Waltman, 2017 ). Although the developed methodology follows validated standards in the scientific literature, the computed analyses should be performed in relation to co-citations and references identified as relevant. Ours is rather an exploratory study, despite the fact that we used quantitative analysis and quantitative assessment of the results. This may pose limitations with regard to the studies that make up the sample, as well as the exclusive use of the WoS academic database. Additionally, the timeframe of the dataset may not fully capture recent developments and emerging trends in the field, potentially excluding recent influential studies. Language biases might also be present, as articles not published in English could be underrepresented in the sample. Furthermore, the study's focus on a specific set of terms that could exclude relevant articles that employ different terminologies. Finally, our study also has a common limitation of bibliometric studies—namely, a certain degree of subjectivity associated with exploratory description when theory is built, and concepts are linked. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into the current state of the literature and lays the groundwork for future research in sustainable development.
