                  Protected areas are essential for the conservation of biodiversity, natural and cultural resources, and contribute to regional and global sustainable development. However, since authorities and stakeholders concern more on the conservation targets of protected areas, how to better evaluate the protected areas' contributions to sustainable development goals (SDGs) remains generally understudied. To fill this knowledge gap, we chose the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) as the study area, mapped the SDGs in 2010, 2015 and 2020, detecting the interactive relationships among SDGs. Then we used the landscape pattern indices and ecosystem service (ES) proxies to describe the characteristics of national nature reserves (NNRs), and explore the contributions of protected areas to SDGs using panel data models. The results showed that from 2010 to 2020, most cities of QTP improved their SDG scores to >60. The three cities with the best SDG performance improved their average scores by nearly 20 %. Among the 69 pairs correlations of SDG indicators, 13 synergies and 6 trade-offs were observed. About 65 % of the SDG indicators were significantly correlated with landscape pattern or ESs of NNRs. Carbon sequestration had a significant positive effect on 30 % of the SDG indicators, while habitat quality had a negative effect on 18 % of the SDG indicators. For the landscape pattern indices, the largest patch index had a significant positive effect on 18 % of the SDG indicators. This study highlighted that the ESs and landscape pattern could well quantify the contribution of protected areas to SDGs, which can provide essential implications for protected area management and regional sustainable development.

Pacheco Protected areas are essential for the conservation of biodiversity, natural and cultural resources, and contribute to regional and global sustainable development. However, since authorities and stakeholders concern more on the conservation targets of protected areas, how to better evaluate the protected areas' contributions to sustainable development goals (SDGs) remains generally understudied. To fill this knowledge gap, we chose the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) as the study area, mapped the SDGs in 2010, 2015 and 2020, detecting the interactive relationships among SDGs. Then we used the landscape pattern indices and ecosystem service (ES) proxies to describe the characteristics of national nature reserves (NNRs), and explore the contributions of protected areas to SDGs using panel data models. The results showed that from 2010 to 2020, most cities of QTP improved their SDG scores to >60. The three cities with the best SDG performance improved their average scores by nearly 20 %. Among the 69 pairs correlations of SDG indicators, 13 synergies and 6 trade-offs were observed. About 65 % of the SDG indicators were significantly correlated with landscape pattern or ESs of NNRs. Carbon sequestration had a significant positive effect on 30 % of the SDG indicators, while habitat quality had a negative effect on 18 % of the SDG indicators. For the landscape pattern indices, the largest patch index had a significant positive effect on 18 % of the SDG indicators. This study highlighted that the ESs and landscape pattern could well quantify the contribution of protected areas to SDGs, which can provide essential implications for protected area management and regional sustainable development.

These goals are important for eradicating poverty, reducing hunger, improving health and education, conserve environment and increasing social equity, which is the world's roadmap for achieving sustainable development in this decade (Hametner et al., 2022 ). To achieve the SDGs, countries around the world are willing to drive the transition to sustainability in multiple areas (D’Arco et al., 2021 ; Ding et al., 2022 ; Fu et al., 2019 ). As the world's most competitive emerging economy, China attaches great importance to sustainable development (Fu et al., 2019 ). In 2016, China released a national plan for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which can serve as a model for other developing countries seeking to the process of global implementation. The interactions among SDGs and influencing factors of SDGs are complex. Scientists have been trying to reveal the synergies and trade-offs between SDGs (Liu and Yuan, 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2022b ; Zhao et al., 2021 ), seek the SDG priorities (Wu et al., 2022 ), and explore the influencing factors of SDGs (Liu et al., 2022a ; Xu et al., 2022b ). Nevertheless, these studies have mostly focused on either global or national scales, making the conclusions failing to inform regional sustainable development (Zhang et al., 2020 ). The protected areas are vital to achieving the SDGs, as they safeguard ecological conservation and community development to maintain resilience and sustainability (Zhang et al., 2022a ). Protected areas are clearly defined geographical spaces which are recognized and managed through legal or administrative means to achieve the long-term conservation of nature (Hoffmann, 2022 ). The protected areas provide significant social and environmental benefits, and even create employment opportunities (Mi et al., 2021 ), contributing to the growth of local economies and poverty alleviation by the tourism, planting industry and education (D’Arco et al., 2021 ; Danish and Wang, 2018 ), and are represented an important tool for biodiversity loss alleviation and ecosystem conservation (Liu et al., 2020 ). However, increasing global protected areas has not entirely halted biodiversity loss, forest area decrease (FAO, 2022 ), and many countries still fall short of meeting the SDGs (Gownaris et al., 2019 ). Protected areas are an effective ecological management method through protecting the landscape, but their contribution to SDGs around protected areas is not clear. On the one hand, protected areas provide important ecosystem services (ESs) and thus have important links with regional sustainable development. The interaction between ESs and SDGs has been extensively detected. Xu et al. (2022b)  identified the impact of urbanization on the relationship between ESs and SDGs and demonstrated that the urbanization significantly impact the ESs' contributions to SDGs. Wood et al. (2017)  suggested that ESs could play an important role in realizing 41 sub-goals among 12 SDGs. However, there are different voices suggesting that the relationship between ESs and SDGs is not synergistic (Reyers and Selig, 2020 ; Xu et al., 2020 ), indicating a complex mechanism from ESs to SDGs. On the other hand, the landscape pattern of protected areas is the basis of ES supply, and may also affect the realization of regional SDGs, especially in less developed areas and ecological fragile areas (Hou et al., 2021 ). As one of the measures of land use management, landscape pattern optimization has been proved to be an important measure to enhance the regional ecological conservation and sustainable development (Gao and Brayan, 2017 ; Ouyang et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2022a ). Landscape pattern indices, such as largest patch index, edge density, and perimeter–area ratio, are widely used to identify the spatial pattern of land cover features of protected areas (Tomaselli et al., 2012 ). However, the relationship between landscape pattern and SDGs is still unclear. China has emphasized that sustainable ecosystems through constructing protected area system are fundamental to human well-being improvement and national development (Chen, 2020 ). The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is important to the ecological security for the entire Asian continent (Teng et al., 2018 ). A variety of protected areas have been established in the QTP with the highest area percentage of protected areas in China, which played a crucial role in ecological conservation. However, environmental pollution, biodiversity loss, soil erosion and other issues related to social development and ecological conservation have emerged in the QTP due to climate change and human activities (Hua et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2022a ). These issues have influenced regional SDGs (Geldmann et al., 2019 ). On October 12, 2021, China officially established its first group of five national parks, marking the beginning of the reshaping of the protected area system with national parks as the main body (Zhang et al., 2022a ). Focusing on protected areas and revealing their contributions to the SDGs will be of great reference for the future optimization of the protected area system. Therefore, evaluating and understanding SDGs and related protected area management to local sustainable development reveals whether the policy match with SDGs, which can provide useful information for authorities and other stakeholders (Schmidt et al., 2019 ). We propose that both ESs and landscape pattern of protected areas should be considered simultaneously when evaluating the protected areas' contribution to SDGs. QTP was thus chosen as a case to assess the contributions of protected areas to SDGs. To identify the SDG performance and SDG interaction, we scored 17 SDG indicators of prefecture-level municipalities in the QTP from 2010 to 2020 and detected their relationships through Spearman correlation analysis. Then five typical ESs (carbon sequestration, water yield, soil retention, habitat provision, and landscape aesthetics) and five landscape pattern indices (total area, largest patch index, edge density, contagion index, Shannon's diversity index) were chosen to represent the ecological effect of NNR, we evaluated the NNRs' contributions to SDGs using panel data model. In doing so, our study enables policy makers to deepen understanding of how well SDGs are performing and the current role of protected areas in achieving SDGs, so that planning can efficiently target the appropriate dimensions of SDGs.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The QTP located in southwest China (Fig. 1 a ) and is often called the “Roof of the World”, the “Water Tower of Asia”, and the “Third Pole”. The average elevation of the QTP is over 4000 m (Fig. 1 b), and the QTP covers an area of >2.5 million km2  (Liu et al., 2020 ). The QTP thins about 2800 km long, north and south about 300–1500 km wide. The annual mean temperature and precipitation are 1.61 °C and 413.6 mm, respectively. The plateau plays an essential role in ecological security and is also the foundation for highland species husbandry (The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China, 2018 ). The plateau spans Qinghai, Tibet, Gansu, Sichuan, Xinjiang and Yunnan Provinces or autonomous regions, with 38 prefecture-level municipalities (Fig. 1 c). By 2018, China had established 155 nature reserves at various levels in the QTP, including 41 NNRs and 64 provincial ones. Nature reserves cover an area of 822, 400 km2 , similar to 31.63 % of the QTP. Nature reserves have significantly promoted the ecological security of the plateau and regional sustainability, and improved human well-beings (The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China, 2018 ).  2.2 Quantifying ES supply Carbon sequestration, water yield, soil retention, habitat provision, and landscape aesthetics were chosen to comprehensively characterize the ES supply of NNRs in the QTP. The selection was based on following principles: (1) these ESs could reflect the ecological information of NNRs; (2) these ESs play an essential role and in accordance with ecological importance of QTP; (3) these ESs could be quantified and compared among different cities. 2.2.1 Carbon sequestration In the study, the carbon sequestration was evaluated by net primary productivity (NPP). NPP is the amount of organic matter accumulated by vegetation in unit area and unit time, which is an important link in the carbon feedback between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere (Liu et al., 2018 ; Xu et al., 2022b ). NPP values were obtained using the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (Potter et al., 1993 ), which is widely used to evaluated carbon sequestration because the approach is relatively simple, and most parameters can be calculated from remote sensing images. The CASA model is described as follows:(1) NPP = ∑ APAR t  × ε t       where APAR(t)  is the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation in month t, ε(t)  is the light utilization efficiency in month t. The detailed calculations for parameters refer to references (Mohamed et al., 2004 ; Zhu et al., 2007 ).  2.2.2 Water yield Fresh water supply is an essential ES that contribute to human wellbeing. Moreover, in view of the important role of QTP in the Asian water cycle, water sources within the region are often included in the coverage of NNRs. In this study, water yield (WY) was obtained using the module in InVEST (3.7.0). The model calculated WY values based on Budyko curve and meteorological parameters, which evaluates the annual value in each unit of the targeted region. The module uses data mainly on precipitation, reference evapotranspiration, land use map, root depth, plant available water content (Liu et al., 2019 ). The annual water yield for each pixel on the landscape is as follows:(2) WY x  = P x  − AET x     where WY(x)  is the annual water yield for grid x , P(x)  is the annual precipitation on pixel x , and AET(x)  is the annual actual evapotranspiration for pixel x . For vegetated land cover, the evapotranspiration portion of the water balance is based on an expression of the Budyko curve. The parameter estimation refers to previous studies (Zhang et al., 2007 ; Zhao et al., 2018 ).  2.2.3 Soil retention Soil loss could cause ecological problems by affecting the health of ecosystems. Soil retention (SR) becomes an important ES for ecological fragile areas. SR can be estimated from the difference between potential and actual soil erosion. In this study, the sediment delivery ratio module of InVEST was employed for SR evaluation. The module simulates the amount of annual soil loss on grid point x , USLE(x),  based on the revised universal soil loss equation:(3) USLE x  = R x  × K x  × LS x  × C x  × P x     (4) SR x  = SLP x  − USLE x     where R(x)  is rainfall erosivity, K(x)  is soil erodibility, LS(x)  is the slope length-gradient factor, C(x)  is a crop-management factor, P(x)  is the support practice factor, SR(x)  is soil retention, and SLP(x)  is potential soil loss. The parameters can be calculated using the method of previous references (Hou et al., 2021 ; Liu et al., 2019 ).  2.2.4 Habitat quality Biodiversity conservation is a key goal of protected area system. QTP is also a global biodiversity hotspot, where habitat quality (HQ) plays an essential role in biodiversity maintenance. This study used HQ as a proxy for biodiversity, identifying the extent of habitat and vegetation types across the study area, and the degradation state (Natural Capital Project, 2022 ). The HQ module of InVEST was employed to combine land use data and threats to biodiversity to simulate HQ maps (Natural Capital Project, 2022 ).(5) Q xj  = H j  1 − D xj z  D xf z  + K z          where Q xj   is the habitat quality in parcel x that is in landscape j, H j   is the habitat suitability of landscape j, D xj   is the total threat level in parcel x with landscape j, z  is 2.5, k  constant is the half-saturation constant. The details of the parameter settings are given in the reference (Natural Capital Project, 2022 ).  2.2.5 Landscape aesthetics The scenic views of landscape of protected areas could contribute to the well-being of local communities and tourism in many aspects. Landscape aesthetics (LA) plays an essential role in boosting local economies by attracting tourists. This study used the scenic quality module of InVEST 3.7.0 to assess LA. The module estimates impacted visibility values in several steps: 1) calculate the visibility for each point and determine the value of the visibility amenity/disamenity by weighting the visibility and applying the valuation function defined in the user interface; 2) sum the valuation rasters to create a weighted aggregate; 3) divide the weighted, aggregate valuation raster into quartiles to create a raster representing visual quality; 4) weight and sum the visibility rasters from all structures points to create a weighted sum of the number of visible points. The parameters needed to run the module are detailed described in the reference (Natural Capital Project, 2022 ).   2.3 Specification of landscape pattern The richness of ESs in protected areas depends not only on human choices, but also on the landscape pattern and structure. According to the meaning of indices and their ability to depict landscape patterns of NNRs, this study selected five landscape pattern indices, including total area (TA), largest patch index (LPI), edge density (ED), contagion index (CONTAG), and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). Specifically, TA represents total landscape area, which is one of the most crucial indices when planning protected area system. LPI refers to the proportion of the largest patch of a certain type in the landscape, which can indirectly reflect the direction of human distribution. ED represents the edge length of unit area in the landscape. CONTAG describes the agglomeration degree or extension trend of various land use types, including spatial information. SHDI equals minus the sum, across all land use types, of the proportional abundance of each land use type multiplied by the proportion. SHDI represents landscape heterogeneity and is particularly sensitive to the imbalanced distribution of patch types in study area. Landscape indices were estimated for each NNR by using the Fragstats 4.0 for ArcGIS in landscape level.  2.4 SDG mapping The principle of selecting SDG indicators is to cover SDGs which may be related with protected areas as many as possible based on the availability of data. The annual data were collected from each prefecture-level city in the QTP. The SDG indicators selected and constructed in the study are presented in Table S1 . In order to make comparisons between SDG indicators, we used the Min-Max normalization method to convert each SDG indicator into a value ranging from 0 to 100 (Liu et al., 2020 ). To minimize the possible effect of extreme values on both tails of the data distribution, we reset the maximum and minimum values for each indicator by referring to the references (Xu et al., 2020 ). For the target values, we first selected an absolute or relatively quantifiable threshold for SDG indicator, such as SDG 1.2.1, 1.5.1, 3.9.1, 6.1.1, 8.5.2, 11.5.2, 11.6.2 and 15.3.1. If there is no obvious threshold for some SDG indicators, the average of the five best-performing cities in the QTP was selected as the target value of SDG indicators, such as SDG 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 8.1.1, 8.5.1, 8.9.1, 10.1.1, 11.7.1, 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. What needs to be emphasized is that when we focus on the index comparison of the cities in the QTP. The target values determined by this method are not necessarily applicable to other regions. Moreover, using the arithmetic mean of the five best-performing cities to set targets does not mean that those areas have achieved the corresponding targets. This approach is only exploratory assessment within the constraints of data availability. Regarding baseline values, we selected the lowest 2.5th-percentile performer by referring previous studies (Liu and Yuan, 2023 ; Sachs et al., 2018 ). The equation used is as follows:(6) x = x i  − x min   x max  − x min    × 100    where x i   is the raw SDG indicator value, x max   and x min   represent the target value and baseline value, respectively, and x  is the normalized value. After data normalization, all SDG indicators can be compared, and a higher value of SDG indicators represents a higher level of SDG achievement, that is, a better performance. The principle of selecting SDG indicators is to cover SDGs which may be related with protected areas as many as possible based on the availability of data. The annual data were collected from each prefecture-level city in the QTP. The SDG indicators selected and constructed in the study are presented in Table S1. In order to make comparisons between SDG indicators, we used the Min-Max normalization method to convert each SDG indicator into a value ranging from 0 to 100 (Liu et al., 2020 ). To minimize the possible effect of extreme values on both tails of the data distribution, we reset the maximum and minimum values for each indicator by referring to the references (Xu et al., 2020 ). For the target values, we first selected an absolute or relatively quantifiable threshold for SDG indicator, such as SDG 1.2.1, 1.5.1, 3.9.1, 6.1.1, 8.5.2, 11.5.2, 11.6.2 and 15.3.1. If there is no obvious threshold for some SDG indicators, the average of the five best-performing cities in the QTP was selected as the target value of SDG indicators, such as SDG 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 8.1.1, 8.5.1, 8.9.1, 10.1.1, 11.7.1, 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. What needs to be emphasized is that when we focus on the index comparison of the cities in the QTP. The target values determined by this method are not necessarily applicable to other regions. Moreover, using the arithmetic mean of the five best-performing cities to set targets does not mean that those areas have achieved the corresponding targets. This approach is only exploratory assessment within the constraints of data availability. Regarding baseline values, we selected the lowest 2.5th-percentile performer by referring previous studies (Liu and Yuan, 2023 ; Sachs et al., 2018 ). The equation used is as follows:(6) x = x i  − x min   x max  − x min    × 100    where x i   is the raw SDG indicator value, x max   and x min   represent the target value and baseline value, respectively, and x  is the normalized value. After data normalization, all SDG indicators can be compared, and a higher value of SDG indicators represents a higher level of SDG achievement, that is, a better performance.  2.5 Identifying SDG interactions Since SDGs were originally conceived as a whole, the complex interactions among SDGs are inevitable. We used the Spearman correlation analysis to identify the relationship between SDG indicators of prefecture-level cities. At the same time, we conducted significance test to identify the relationship between SDGs. If a correlation coefficient is larger than 0.5, the relationship between SDGs is synergy. If a correlation coefficient is smaller than −0.5, the relationship between SDGs is trade-off (Liu and Yuan, 2023 ).  2.6 Expounding the contributions of NNRs to SDGs We used panel data model to identify the contributions of NNRs to SDGs in the QTP. In contrast to general linear regression models, panel data models have been widely used because they not only consider the commonality of the cross-sectional data, but also allow for the analysis of the individual particular effects of the cross-sectional factors. In our models, SDG indicators were used as the explained variables and landscape pattern indices and ecosystem service indicators of NNRs were used as explanatory variables. By examining the relationship between each SDG indicator, ESs and landscape pattern indices of NNRs, we can determine which model is better. The Hausman test was performed to help select the fixed or random effect model. When the test value is <0.05, the hypothesis is rejected at the 5 % significance level, and the fixed effect model is superior to the random effect model (Ouyang et al., 2022 ). It was finally determined that SDG 1.2.1, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 3.9.1, 6.1.1, 8.5.1, 11.5.2 and 15.1.1 applied fixed effect models, and SDG 1.5.1, 8.1.1, 8.5.2, 8.9.1, 11.5.2, 11.6.2, 11.7.1, 15.1.2 and 15.3.1 applied random effect models. In each model, we used logarithmic transformations to remove the effects of heteroscedasticity and different orders of magnitude (Liu and Yuan, 2023 ).  2.7 Data sources The data sources used for SDG indicator calculations are described in Table S1 . The land use maps with resolution of 30 m were observed from RESDC (http://www.resdc.cn ). The digital elevation model and MODIS data were downloaded from GDCS (http://www.gscloud.cn ). The soil parameters were obtained from the China Soil Map-based Harmonized World Soil Database (http://westdc.westgis.accn ). The meteorological parameters were retrieved from China Meteorological Administration (http://data.cma.cn ). The data sources used for SDG indicator calculations are described in Table S1. The land use maps with resolution of 30 m were observed from RESDC (http://www.resdc.cn ). The digital elevation model and MODIS data were downloaded from GDCS (http://www.gscloud.cn ). The soil parameters were obtained from the China Soil Map-based Harmonized World Soil Database (http://westdc.westgis.accn ). The meteorological parameters were retrieved from China Meteorological Administration (http://data.cma.cn ).   3 Results 3.1 Spatiotemporal variations of SDG scores The scores vary across SDG indicators in the QTP (Fig. 2  ). The Keshan disease incidence per 10,000 population (SDG 3.9.1) was the highest, with an average score of 90.86. The affected persons attributed to disasters per 10,000 population (SDG 1.5.1), the direct economic losses caused by natural disasters as a percentage of GDP (SDG 11.5.2) and the days of air quality equal to or above Grade II (SDG 11.6.2) were high, close to the targeted values with average scores of above 74.11. The gross agricultural product (SDG 2.3.1) achieved a score of 16.14, which was the lowest of all SDG indicators. The average money wage (SDG 8.5.1) and the urban registered unemployment rate (SDG 8.5.2) achieved a score of 28.19 and 24.42, respectively, which was relatively low. Fig. 3   indicates the score difference between 2010 and 2020 of each city. For SDG 1.2.1, 2.3.2, 6.1.1, and 8.5.1, almost all cities obtained higher scores in 2020 than those in 2010. For SDG 10.1.1, the scores of 2020 of each city significantly decreased compared with 2010. In addition, most cities exhibited an upward trend in SDG 1.5.1, 2.3.1, 8.9.1, 8.5.2, 15.1.1, and 11.7.1. Moreover, there were significant differences of scores among provinces in the QTP. The number of SDG indicator in Yunnan was 12, which showed the most growth. Qinghai and Xinjiang followed with 11 and 10 SDG indicators, respectively. Gansu and Tibet, however, each had 9 SDG indicators of degradation. In terms of spatial pattern, the SDG score indicated a pattern of low in the west and northeast and high in the east in 2010 (Fig. 4 a ). Specifically, the three highest score cities were Haidong, Guoluo and Chengdu, with an average SDG score of 57.51. The lowest three cities were all distributed in the east where the average SDG score was 37.91. With regional development, most cities experienced an increase in SDG scores in 2015 (Fig. 4 b). But there were still some cities with moderate growth, which resulted in relatively low scores across the QTP, such as Bayingol and Linxia. Xining, Diqing and Nujiang were the top three cities with the highest score in 2015, with an average SDG score of 61.34. Moving forward to 2020, the spatial pattern of SDG score had further changed. Most cities in the QTP scored >60, located in the west, south and east (Fig. 4 c). The three highest score cities were Linzhi, Diqing and Chengdu, with an average SDG score of 68.83. However, the SDG scores of Lanzhou and Linxia, although they had risen to 49.83 and 48.59, respectively, remained the lowest in 2020.  3.2 SDG interactions Among the 17 SDG indicators, 40 pairs exhibit significant positive correlations while 29 pairs exhibited significant negative correlations (Fig. 5  ). The number of positive correlations was higher than that of negative ones, indicating that the prospect for achieving the SDGs in the QTP are bright. Among 69 pairs correlations, 13 synergies and 6 trade-offs were observed. Furthermore, among 17 SDG indicators, SDG 1.2.1 (rural poverty incidence), SDG 2.3.2 (per capita disposable income of rural residents), and SDG 8.5.1 (average money wage), all had synergistic relationships with the 4 indicators and the mutual promotion effect was evident. However, there was a trade-off between SDG 10.1.1 (ratio of income of urban and rural residents), and the three indicators, indicating that SDG 10.1.1 is an important indicator in conflict with the other indicators (i.e., SDG 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 11.7.1).  3.3 NNRs' contributions to SDGs Panel data model analysis of 17 SDG indicators showed that 11 indicators were significantly correlated with landscape pattern and ESs of NNRs in the QTP (Table 1  ). 8 SDG indicators were significantly affected by the ESs of NNRs, while 8 were affected by landscape patterns. Specifically, the NPP of NNRs significantly affected 6 SDG indicators, namely, SDG 1.2.1, 3.9.1, 6.1.1, 8.5.2, 11.5.2 and 15.1.2. HQ and SR were the other two ESs that affected the SDG indicators and had a significant effect on the three SDG indicators, respectively. In terms of landscape pattern indices, TA and LPI affected five and four SDG indicators, respectively. TA had a significant positive effect on SDG 1.5.1 and SDG 8.5.1, but a significant negative effect on SDG 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 15.1.1. LPI had a significant negative effect on SDG 2.3.1 and a significant positive effect on SDG 6.1.1, 11.5.2 and 15.1.2. Additionally, CONTAG and SHDI were found to have a significant effect on only one SDG indicator, SDG 15.1.1, forest cover rate and SDG 15.1.2, the area of wetland ecological nature reserve accounts for the proportion of forestry system nature reserve area.   4 Discussion 4.1 SDG performance of the QTP This study could assist in evaluating and understanding the SDG performance. For the QTP overall, the performance of SDGs varied, and some were at relatively low levels, such as SDG 2.3.1, 15.1.2, 8.5.2 and 8.5.1 (Fig. 2 ). Among them, SDG 15.1.2, the area of wetland ecological nature reserve accounts for the proportion of forestry system nature reserve area, is limited by natural conditions, so there is no need to pay too much attention to it. However, SDG 2.3.1, 8.5.2 and 15.1.2 involve agricultural development, employment and people's income. Policy makers are therefore advised to deal with it through agricultural modernization (Liu et al., 2022b ), creating employment opportunities (D’Arco et al., 2021 ), strengthening the economic compensation (Zhang et al., 2020 ), and broadening residents' income channels (Xu et al., 2014 ). Our results showed that the performance of SDG 3.9.1 for Keshan disease incidence per 10,000 population scored the highest. This indicates that the prevention and control of Keshan disease in the QTP is effective. Additionally, SDG 1.5.1, 11.5.2 and 11.6.2 all scored high, mainly due to the effective disaster prevention and mitigation efforts and the blue sky protection campaign carried out in China in recent years (Qiu, 2014 ; Shi et al., 2016 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). At the provincial level, the number of increasing SDG indicators in both Tibet and Gansu from 2010 to 2020 was eight, the lowest among the provinces in the QTP, putting SDG performance in a situation close to 50–50 (Fig. 3 ). One possible reason is that Tibet and Gansu have lagged in economic and social development compared to other regions, leading to a lag in the SDG performance, with their GDP ranking 22nd and last among China's 31 provinces and municipalities in 2020, respectively. Previous studies have generally taken a national or provincial scale and lacked support for the sustainability of specific cities (Wu et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). At the municipal level, our study indicated that most cities (about 84 %) improved twelve to fourteen SDG indicators from 2010 to 2020 (Figs. 3 and 4 ). However, Lhasa, Chengdu and Deyang all had 6 SDG indicator deterioration. Therefore, our study also points out areas of weakness for these cities to implement targeted measures to improve their level of sustainability.  4.2 Relationship between SDG indicators There were more synergies than tradeoffs between SDG indicators in this study (Fig. 5 ). This finding has been confirmed by other studies (Liu and Yuan, 2023 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ; Zhao et al., 2021 ), but contrary to some previous studies that tradeoffs are dominating (Bowen et al., 2017 ; Gao and Brayan, 2017 ). Urban and Hametner (2022)  demonstrated that the synergistic relationship between SDG 8 and SDG 12 was found in Austria. At the same time, they also found that SDG 15, 2 and 6 produced a synergistic relationship within the economy-environment nexus, but no significance was detected in our results. Fu et al. (2019)  divided 17 SDGs into three groups, including “Essential Needs” “Objectives”, and “Governance”, based on the theory of coupled human and natural systems. SDG indicators selected in our study mostly belong to “Essential Needs” (SDG 6 and SDG 15) and “Objectives” (SDG 1, 3, 8 and 10). Zhang et al. (2022b)  demonstrated that SDG 6 and SDG 15 played a significant role in the “Essential Needs”, SDG 1, 5 and 10 played a significant role in the “Objectives”, and found that the SDGs in “Essential Needs” & “Objectives” generally showed synergies in the QTP, which is why our results were similar. In addition, in recent years, national policy guidance has been issued for the QTP. That is, ecological conservation is at the core, and the construction of protected areas is considered an essential tool for ecological conservation (Xu et al., 2022a ). Through measures such as sustainable livelihood and green industry development, the concept of ecological conservation has been integrated into multiple dimensions of social and economic development (Li et al., 2020 ; Mi et al., 2021 ). This may be another reason why paired SDG indicator are mostly synergies.  4.3 Protected areas' contributions to SDGs and management implications Most previous research on the SDGs in China has been done from the perspective of an comprehensive analysis of society (Xu et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2022b ; Zhao et al., 2021 ), or economic and social aspects (Liu et al., 2022a ). This study, by focusing on protected areas in plateau area, provides a comprehensive analysis of the sustainability of the SDGs in the QTP with available data. Protected areas are crucial conservation strategies and have socioeconomic impacts on people living in and around them. The spread of benefits to areas outside protected areas is often negligible (den Braber et al., 2018 ). Table 1  showed that landscape indices, representing dominant patch significance (LPI), dominant patch connectivity (CONTAG) and landscape fragmentation (SHDI), significantly increased a certain number of SDGs, indicating that protected area has a certain promotion effect on the realization of regional SDGs through landscape pattern. Previous studies on landscape pattern have also found that suitable landscape patterns are beneficial for economic development and ecological conservation (Fohrer et al., 2005 ; Fu and Zhou, 2008 ; Sharma and Singh, 1994 ), which is similar to the SDGs to some extent. However, the increase of TA (total area of NNRs) could reduce the SDG 2.3.1 (gross agricultural product) and SDG 2.3.2 (per capita disposable income of rural residents), which indicated that the establishment of protected areas would reduce the local agricultural development and farmers' income to some extent. This finding is consistent with a previous study (Brockington and Wilkie, 2015 ). The construction of protected areas will inevitably compress the environment and opportunities for agricultural development, resulting in the above situation. This study can help protected area management perform more targeted policies. For the QTP, natural habitat is an essential basis for maintaining biodiversity (Liu et al., 2020 ). But our results indicated that protected areas with higher habitat quality tended to have higher unemployment and higher natural disasters as a percentage of GDP (Table 1 ). This is because protected areas are often under strict ecological conservation measures, and effective responses to natural disasters require a combination of social and engineering measures, which is where these areas are weak. Based on the characteristics of regional natural disasters, more targeted management can be implemented in protected areas to improve response capacity. In addition, NPP significantly increased five SDG indicators and SR and LA each increased two SDG indicators (Table 1 ). The above demonstrated that a synergistic relationship between ES supply of protected area and regional sustainable development could be achieved, which is consistent with previous studies in China (Liu et al., 2022a ; Xu et al., 2022b ; Zhang et al., 2022a ). However, under the dual effects of human activities and climate change, the change of NPP in the QTP may change from upward to downward, and the increase of NPP may also cause local water resource overconsumption, thus threatening the sustainable development (Ma et al., 2022 ). In the UK, as early as around 2002, Scottish National Park management policies were written to co-ordinate the promotion of social and economic development in the communities where protected landscapes were located with the conservation of natural and cultural heritage (Janssen, 2009 ; McCarthy et al., 2002 ). Studies in the African and European protected areas suggested that investment should be enhancement in management and involvement of local communities in the planning and management of protected areas to promote synergies between ES and local sustainable development (Gatiso et al., 2022 ). Therefore, systems-based management, combining ES improvement and landscape pattern optimization should be adopted, which has been confirmed by the study in Southern Italy (D’Arco et al., 2021 ). To fully achieve SDGs, we suggest that the construction and planning of protected areas in the QTP should optimize landscape patterns and enhancing ecosystem conservation, thus improving ES supply. Also, SDG management needs to acknowledge and eliminate potential trade-offs between SDGs (Urban and Hametner, 2022 ).  4.4 Limitations and future research directions To promote SDG performance in the QTP, we proposed the “ESs- and landscape pattern-based assessment” for protected areas' contributions to SDGs. The data required for our framework is simple, the logic of the analysis is clear, and it can facilitate and quickly carry out similar studies in other regions of the world, as well as provide an effective reference for studies of the correlation between protected areas and SDGs. In the study, landscape pattern indices and ES proxies were used to represent the characteristics of protected areas, and to establish a relationship with SDG indicators. Applying such an analytical framework is to seek out and determine the protected areas' contributions to SDGs. However, due to data limitations, many characteristics of protected areas, such as flagship species, conservation objectives and development plans, have not been considered. Therefore, the subsequent analysis of the protected area-SDG linkage mechanism still needs to be strengthened. Additionally, the relationship between ESs and SDGs can be affected by other factors such as urbanization, ecosystem health, and climate change which has been proven to have a significant impact on the relationship between ESs and economic and ecological SDGs (Hernández-Blanco et al., 2022 ; Manley and Egoh, 2022 ; Xu et al., 2022b ). The complex interaction mechanisms and drivers between ESs and SDGs deserve attention in future studies. Moreover, starting in 2015, China launched 10 pilot national parks to conserve the natural environment and biodiversity. Both the Three-River-Source National Park and the Qilian Mountain National Park are involved in integrating various nature reserves in the pilot project to protect the ecology and improve human welfare in the QTP. Previous studies have shown the impact of national park construction on residents' income and tourism development in the SDGs (D’Arco et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2022a ). However, this study was limited to data acquisition and failed to include pilot areas of national parks in the evaluation. We will further explore the impact of national parks on the achievement of regional Sustainable Development Goals.   5 Conclusions Evaluating the NNRs' contributions to SDGs can assist understand the linkage mechanism between SDG performance and ecological conservation instruments. Since most SDG studies do not consider the impact of protected areas on SDGs, it is difficult to provide comprehensive support for the formulation of regional sustainable development policies. To solve this question, we assessed and analyzed spatiotemporal variations of SDGs and identifying the contributions of NNRs to achieving SDGs in QTP, considering ESs and landscape pattern. Our results indicate that the overall level of SDG performance in the QTP has been effectively improved from 2010 to 2020, but several cities are still at low levels. The top three cities with the best SDG performance improved their average scores by nearly 20 %. The number of paired SDG indicators with synergistic relationships was significantly higher than the number of trade-off ones, suggesting that multiple SDGs can be jointly promoted by targeted management decisions. Furthermore, about 65 % of SDG indicators were significantly correlated with landscape pattern and ESs of NNRs, which gave us the possibility to enhance regional sustainability through the optimization and management of protected area system. Our “ESs- and landscape pattern- based assessment” framework not only provides a way to assess the contributions of protected areas to SDGs, but it also provides appropriate support for decision makers, by identifying weaknesses in SDG performance in cities.
