                  Achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the sub-national scale requires contextual insights and localized implementation. This study utilizes Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to assess SDG progress and interactions in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) metropolitan region of China. Population growth, economic development, and rapid urbanization are key drivers, exerting pressures on energy and water consumption, pollutant discharges, transportation, environmental degradation, and disaster management. The results reveal varied progress in nine goals intrinsic to this metropolitan context, with notable progress in energy and water consumption, and employment (Goals 7, 8, and 3). While moderate progress is evidenced in poverty reduction, economic growth, healthcare services, social security, access to potable water, water quality (Goals 1 and 6), challenges remain in transportation, waste generation, air quality, forest management, and disaster response (Goals 9, 11, and 15). Furthermore, target interaction analysis suggests that initiatives in high-leverage areas - ecosystem and environmental protection, equal access to resources and basic services, and climate change response - can yield substantial systemic impacts. However, poverty reduction, access to resources and basic services, ecosystem protection, and economic growth appear more dependent on system-wide efforts. By leveraging the DPSIR model, this context-sensitive SDG assessment accentuates priority zones and offers valuable perspective for cohesive SDG strategy formation and policy-making in dynamically growing metropolitan areas globally.

Achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the sub-national scale requires contextual insights and localized implementation. This study utilizes Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to assess SDG progress and interactions in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) metropolitan region of China. Population growth, economic development, and rapid urbanization are key drivers, exerting pressures on energy and water consumption, pollutant discharges, transportation, environmental degradation, and disaster management. The results reveal varied progress in nine goals intrinsic to this metropolitan context, with notable progress in energy and water consumption, and employment (Goals 7, 8, and 3). While moderate progress is evidenced in poverty reduction, economic growth, healthcare services, social security, access to potable water, water quality (Goals 1 and 6), challenges remain in transportation, waste generation, air quality, forest management, and disaster response (Goals 9, 11, and 15). Furthermore, target interaction analysis suggests that initiatives in high-leverage areas - ecosystem and environmental protection, equal access to resources and basic services, and climate change response - can yield substantial systemic impacts. However, poverty reduction, access to resources and basic services, ecosystem protection, and economic growth appear more dependent on system-wide efforts. By leveraging the DPSIR model, this context-sensitive SDG assessment accentuates priority zones and offers valuable perspective for cohesive SDG strategy formation and policy-making in dynamically growing metropolitan areas globally.

Cities and metropolitan regions face a broad suite of sustainability challenges, such as economic inequality, social unrest, environmental degradation, climate-related risks, and unsustainable consumption of resources (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ; Chan et al., 2021 ; Saiu et al., 2022 ). For instance, urban areas emit approximately 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions (Han et al., 2023 ). Therefore, an integrated perspective and approach are crucial to comprehend and tackle social, economic, and environmental challenges; align priorities and goals; strategically formulate policies; and enhance governance for sustainable urban futures. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable,” is an urban-focused goal among the 17 SDGs outlined in the United Nations’s (UN’s) 2030 Agenda (UN, 2015 ). Theoretically, Goal 11 encompasses key concepts, such as inclusiveness, safety, resilience, and sustainability, guiding decision-makers to comprehensively addressing the complexities of urban development. For instance, the application of “urban sustainability” can inspire policymakers to address resource efficiency, while “urban resilience” highlights disaster recovery, which is crucial for guiding urban change (Elmqvist et al., 2019 ). Goal 11 offers practical guidance for implementing sustainable urban policies and practices. Its specific targets and indicators allow for progress evaluation and facilitate stakeholders in developing action plans, allocating resources, and making informed decisions aligned with the SDGs. For example, Cape Town, South Africa, sought to align SDG work with the elaboration of a resilience strategy, while the City of Malmå, Sweden, established a sustainability unit within the City Office in 2017 to address fragmented implementation across different sectors (Valencia et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, the SDGs represent an integrated set of interdependent global priorities, rather than standalone goals. Thus, the Goal 11 is not the only “urban goal” (ICSU, 2017 ; Saiu et al., 2022 ). Many other SDGs are intrinsically linked to Goal 11, such as equal access to basic services (Goal 1), sustainable management of water and sanitation (Goal 6), the decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation (Goal 8), and sustainable forest management (Goal 15). Unlike the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDG framework explicitly considers the critical urban role in advancing sustainable development (Saiu et al., 2022 ). The SDG actions are concentrated in urban areas as pivotal sites to address socioeconomic disparities, provide basic services, and halt environmental degradation (Saiu et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2022b ). Thus, the systemic and integrated nature of the SDGs could facilitate sustainable urbanization. It provides cities and metropolitan regions with opportunities to holistically examine planning and governance approaches and to solve various socioeconomic and environmental issues in a timely and effective manner. Existing studies and practices have highlighted the need to examine SDG achievements and interactions at the regional level, drawing the attention of policymakers and scholars (Nagy et al., 2018 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ; Wu and Sun, 2023 ). In particular, metropolitan regions are more complex than single administrative or geographical units (e.g., cities or watersheds), conspicuously confronting diverse sustainability issues in the 21st  century (UNDESA, 2018 ). Thus, this study selected the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, which is a representative metropolitan region vital to national economic development with a complex socio-ecological system, as the study site. First, since China’s 1978 reform and opening-up, the PRD’s industrialization, economic growth, and urbanization have significantly driven its and national economic development, making it one of the most vibrant regions in China and the Global South. Despite occupying only 1.87% of China’s land area, the PRD generated 8.93% of the national GDP and accommodated 10.90% of the population, with the population increasing from 23.70 million in 1990 to 78.24 million in 2020 (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2021 ; Statistic Bureau of Guangdong Province 2015-2021 ). Second, rapid growth and resource-intensive development have created sustainability issues in the PRD, including urban sprawl, pollution, congestion, public service pressure, and natural habitat loss. These challenges are closely related to SDGs, such as Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities ), Goal 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure ), and Goal 15 (life on land ). For instance, the PRD’s built-up area increased by 169% between 1990 and 2018, leading to urban sprawl and cropland decline (Ye et al., 2021 ); housing prices in Shenzhen, one of the municipalities in the PRD, increased six-fold from $627 to $8,065 per square meter between 1998 and 2017, an inflation-adjusted growth of approximately 626.4%, creating housing affordability issues (Li et al., 2021 ). Investigating the status and trends of the SDGs in metropolitan regions such as the PRD could derive insights into critical issues, identify priorities, and support the achievement of the SDGs in rapidly urbanizing and industrializing regions. The PRD’s socioeconomic and eco-environmental features make it an ideal region for examining SDG performance and interlinkages. This study focuses on the PRD, investigating the SDG progress and interactions at the sub-national and urban scales. The specific research objectives are as follows: (1) to identify key sustainability issues and related goals for localizing SDGs in a metropolitan context using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework; (2) to assess the progress and trends of the selected SDGs through indicator measurement; and (3) to evaluate the interlinks between SDG targets using a cross-impact matrix and network analysis. The methods used to assess the PRD SDG-related performance and interlinkages can also be applied to other rapidly urbanized metropolitan regions in China or worldwide.  2 Literature review 2.1 SDGs and urban sustainability Adopted by the UN in 2015, the SDGs provide an integrated framework for addressing diverse pressing issues facing the planet and its people (UN, 2015 ). Compared to the MDGs, the SDGs aim at balancing social inclusion, economic development, and environmental protection, making them more ambitious, complex, and globally embraced. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 requires collective efforts to address all multidimensional challenges at the global, national, regional, and local scales (UCLG, 2020 ). With over 55% of the world’s population residing in urban areas, a robust focus on cities and metropolitan regions is essential to attaining these goals (UNDESA, 2018 ). Apart from the urban-focused SDG 11, multiple SDG targets within other goals are explicitly related to local policy domains, such as the impacts of natural disasters (Target 1.5), economic growth (Target 8.1), energy consumption (Target 7.3), greenhouse gas emissions (Target 13.2), and transportation (Target 9.1). In particular, metropolitan regions, which evolve from urban agglomerations and surrounding areas that are less densely populated but have strong socioeconomic connections, are increasingly recognized as crucial battlegrounds to address the most significant global challenges and as ideal experimental sites for pragmatically localizing SDGs at the sub-national scale (GTF, UNDP, & UN-Habitat, 2016 ; Nagy et al., 2018 ). Metropolitan regions have unique and significant potential to contribute to the global 2030 Agenda, as they face both challenges and opportunities when it comes to sustainable development (GTF, UNDP, & UN-Habitat, 2016 ; Gómez-Álvarez et al., 2017 ; ICSU, 2017 ). On the one hand, they confront complex and pressing issues, such as economic inequality, social unrest, environmental degradation, climate-related risks, and the unsustainable resource consumption (Zhang et al., 2019 ; Andersson and Ghesquiere, 2020 ; Chen et al., 2021b ). Inadequate metropolitan arrangements could exacerbate these issues and miss development opportunities, impeding the achievement of multiple SDGs (Andersson and Ghesquiere, 2020 ). On the other hand, metropolitan regions represent both population concentration and hubs of economic activities and development; thus, they can pragmatically drive innovation and pilot sustainability solutions (Nagy et al., 2018 ; Wu and Sun, 2023 ). In the near future, metropolitan regions will continue to experience intensive urbanization. The global population living in cities with over 1 million inhabitants reached 1.64 billion in 2015, more than twice the population in 1990, and is predicted to grow to 2.38 billion by 2030 (UNDESA, 2019 ). The number of cities with more than 1 million inhabitants will increase to 706 by 2030 (UNDESA, 2019 ). With abundant resources and advantageous locations, metropolitan regions play vital economic roles nationally and globally. For instance, the New York metropolitan region, Tokyo metropolitan region, and the PRD region play a key role in driving the national economy, respectively producing 9.3%, 33%, and 8.93% of their national GDPs (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2021 ; Statistic Bureau of Guangdong Province, 2021 ; BEA, 2022 ; e-Stat, n.d. ). In this context, the integrated SDG framework provides guidance for metropolitan regions to measure progress and trends, identify priorities, promote cross-city and cross-sector cooperation, and enhance far-sighted, integrative, and cooperative planning and management for a sustainable urban future (Retief et al., 2016 ; Gómez-Álvarez et al., 2017 ; UNDESA, 2019 ; Andersson and Ghesquiere, 2020 ). However, localizing SDGs at the sub-national level remains challenging. These specific challenges involve data availability and understanding the heterogeneous context, requiring the identification of goals, extensive data collection, and performance monitoring.  2.2 Assessment of progress towards SDGs Monitoring progress towards the SDGs by assessing past and current conditions is crucial for tracking sustainability status and guiding policymaking (Wu et al., 2022a ). Relevant assessments are currently conducted at global and national levels through indicator measurements. For instance, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) developed the SDG Index and Dashboards to measure 17 SDGs nationally. The SDSN applies a composite index approach and scores countries on SDG progress to enable performance comparisons, evidence-based policymaking, and sharing of best practices (Nagy et al., 2018 ). Apart from quantitative assessments, Voluntary National Reviews by countries provide qualitative insights into policies, strategies, and actions to achieve SDGs annually. Additionally, the European Union (EU) has developed a tailored dashboard with indicators aligned with the SDGs and their context and policies (European Commission and Eurostat, 2019 ; Cling et al., 2020 ). The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also developed a baseline report on snapshots of member states’ SDG progress and gaps that require attention (The ASEAN Secretariat, 2020 ). Moreover, Allen et al. (2019)  focused on 14 environmental SDGs (14 of 17 goals and 43 of 169 targets) for Arab countries, applied complementary approaches, and found that Targets 1.5, 2.1, and 2.4 should be top priorities. Compared to global and national levels, SDG assessment at sub-national levels, such as metropolitan regions, remains underexplored. Previous studies have shown that measuring SDG progress is crucial for defining attainment and informing local policies (Nagy et al., 2018 ). Urban-focused Goal 11 evaluation has received substantial scholarly attention. For instance, Xu et al. (2019)  focused on Goal 11 and applied FPPSI (the full-permutation polygon synthetic indicator) method to assess the sustainability of 26 cities in the Yangtze River Delta from to 2007–2016. Other studies have qualitatively analyzed SDG alignment in specific cities in terms of policies and strategies (Koch and Krellenberg, 2018 ; Valencia et al., 2019 ; Croese et al., 2020 ). In addition to assessing individual goals across cities, researchers have attempted broader contextual measurements. For example, Wu et al. (2022a)  conducted an SDG progress assessment from 2000 to 2015 at the provincial level in China and classified provinces into different categories based on regional performance, revealing strengths, weaknesses, and collaboration needs. Nagy et al. (2018)  measured 16 SDGs in a Romanian metropolitan area by calculating the scores for each locality and the overall SDG index, uncovering performance variations among municipalities. However, although these studies provide valuable insights, they either focus on one goal without considering multiple SDGs, or assess the overall progress without addressing specific goals locally. Insufficient insights into the progress and trends of a set of goals could weaken local government participation and thus national progress towards SDGs (UCLG, 2022 ). Therefore, it is imperative to identify closely related goals and evaluate their progress in sub-national contexts, especially in metropolitan regions characterized by complex and dynamic socio-ecological systems.  2.3 Assessment of interactions between SDGs Because the SDG framework represents a highly complex and fundamentally interdependent set of global priorities, understanding the interactions between them can optimize the outcome by activating synergies, avoiding trade-offs, and fostering integrated policymaking (Nilsson et al., 2016 ; ICSU, 2017 ). Previous studies have explored SDG interlinkages using network mapping, cross-impact matrix assessment, correlation analysis, system modelling, and other approaches. The seven-point scale of SDG interactions proposed by Nilsson et al. (2016)  is a popular tool for exploring the nature of interlinkages, ranging from +3 (most positive) to −3 (most negative), to inform evidence-based decisions. For instance, the ICSU (2017)  applied this scale to assess four goals (Goals 2, 3, 7, and 14) and identified 238 positive interactions at the target level (66 negative and 12 neutral). Looking at specific goals, Fuso Nerini et al. (2018)  investigated the synergies and tradeoffs between Goal 7 and other goals, identifying 113 targets requiring energy system changes. They documented 208 relationships between efforts to achieve Goal 7 and delivery of the 2030 Agenda as a whole, including 143 synergies and 65 tradeoffs. For instance, coal consumption could improve access to energy (Goal 7), but would accelerate climate change (Goal 13) and worsen pollution-related health problems attributed to air pollution (Goal 3) (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). Similarly, Maes et al. (2019)  focused on Goal 1, stating 91 targets requiring urban ecosystem actions with 102 documented relationships: 99 synergies and 51 trade-offs. Decisions regarding urban ecosystems affect the ability to achieve welfare, well-being, and sustainable infrastructure. Apart from goal-specific analyses, interlinkage assessments have also been conducted across countries and regions (e.g., the Arab region, Sweden, and sub-Saharan Africa). Pradhan et al. (2017)  applied a correlation analysis to the official SDG indicator data of 227 countries to systematically identify synergies and trade-offs between goals. They found that Goal 1 (no poverty ) exhibited widespread synergies with other goals, whereas Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production ) displayed tradeoffs. Additionally, Allen et al. (2019)  conducted a multi-criteria analysis of 22 Arab countries to prioritize SDG targets based on “level of urgency,” “systemic impacts,” “policy gaps”. Target 7.3 (energy efficiency ), 7.2 (renewable energy ), and 12.2 (sustainable resource management ) exerted the greatest systemic impact across the 43 selected targets. Weitz et al. (2018)  used a cross-impact matrix and network analysis techniques to examine systemic SDG interactions in Sweden. They identified Target 6.6 (effective institutions ), 12.1 (sustainable consumption/production ), and 8.4 (resources efficiency ) as the most positively influential. Some studies also examined territorial spaces such as river basins. For instance, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies IGES (2019)  uses scenarios to explore SDG interactions in river basins, considering development, population, land use, and climate change. However, as with progress assessment, evaluating SDG interlinkages at the sub-national or local levels remains limited compared to that at the global and national levels. Insights into SDG interactions in sub-national contexts such as metropolitan regions are lacking.  2.4 Linking SDGs to the Pearl River Delta metropolitan region Metropolitan regions have become critical battlegrounds in addressing significant global challenges. Developing countries undergoing rapid urbanization and industrialization have unprecedented opportunities to shape their sustainable urban futures (UN-Habitat, 2016 ; Gómez-Álvarez et al., 2017 ). While previous studies have mainly assessed SDG progress and interactions globally and nationally, providing valuable insights into initiatives and policies, local application of the SDG framework remains limited. This gap hinders urban contributions from achieving the SDGs. More research is needed to adapt the SDGs to metropolitan contexts. Therefore, this study used the Pearl River Delta metropolitan region as a case study to assess progress and interactions across the selected SDGs. The PRD metropolitan region is located in Guangdong Province in southern China, surrounding the Pearl River estuary, which flows into the South China Sea. It consists of nine cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, Huizhou, Dongguan, and Zhongshan), occupying 54763 km2  (Fig. 1  ). As one of China’s most urbanized, populated, and economically vibrant metropolitan areas, with a population density of 1428 people/km2  and an urbanization rate of 87.24% in 2020, the PRD faces various sustainability issues despite its conspicuous economic growth. Intensive human activities have degraded ecosystems, with 8107.5 km2  of farmland, woodland, grassland, and wetland lost since 1980, while built-up areas grew by 1066.6 km2 . This densely populated region is also vulnerable to climate risks such as typhoons and sea level rise. Moreover, unequal development has created disparities in economic resources and public services between migrants and urban residents (Liu et al., 2020 ). Overlooking these issues could impair the PRD’s sustainable development. The rapid growth, ecological significance, and economic importance of the PRD make it an ideal case study for applying an integrated SDG framework in a metropolitan context. These lessons could inform sustainable development in other urbanizing regions, especially the rapidly growing estuary and coastal areas of developing nations.   3 Materials and methods 3.1 Conceptual framework This study explored the application and assessment of SDGs in a metropolitan region with various sustainability issues (see Fig. 2  ). First, a systematic literature review was conducted to select a set of goals, targets, and indicators. This step applied the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model to identify sustainability issues and contextualize SDGs. Next, the selected SDG progress and trends were evaluated for the entire PRD and the nine cities. Additionally, this study examined target interactions using a cross-impact matrix and network analysis to identify potential SDG synergies or tradeoffs.  3.2 Data sources Three types of data were used: literature, statistical, and geospatial, along with expert feedback (Table 3 ). First, relevant literature was searched and reviewed to identify metropolitan sustainability issues and select a set of goals, targets, and indicators for assessment focusing on the PRD region. The literature includes scientific articles and reports from the Web of Science as well as regional plans related to the PRD. Second, statistical data were collected from Guangdong Statistical Yearbooks, Guangdong Rural Statistical Yearbooks, government agency reports, and websites. Statistical data (e.g., population and urban population size, GDP, and generation rates of waste and wastewater) were used to measure the performance of the indicators and goals. Third, geospatial data on land use, greenhouse gas emissions, public transportation stations, and grid populations were collected. The performance of the indicators and goals was assessed based on the evolution of the indicator in any consecutive five-year period from to 2012–2020, subject to data availability. In exceptional cases, a shorter period of at least three years was calculated. Furthermore, to assess the target interlinks, experts were invited to score the SDG target interactions and provide their opinions.  3.3 Analysis methods 3.3.1 Selecting SDGs: systematic review and DPSIR model To select the relevant goals, targets, and indicators for assessing the PRD metropolitan context, this study conducted a systematic review and applied the DPSIR framework, which is a clear and organized tool for identifying targets and indicators for sustainability assessment (Sekovski et al., 2012 ). The standardized systematic review methods of Haddaway et al. (2018)  were also applied to the literature review. Scientific papers and reports were searched in the Web of Science and analyzed with CiteSpace to collect highly relevant, frequently cited, interlinked literature and summarized hot topics about SDGs on urban or metropolitan scales. Regional plans related to the PRD were also reviewed to contextualize the SDGs and identify data for the selected targets and indicators. 3.3.1.1 Selected goals Through a systematic review, it was found that the themes in the literature were explicitly related to nine goals: Goals 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 15. Most articles discuss poverty (Goal 1), health (Goal 3), water supply and quality (Goal 6), energy (Goal 7), economic development (Goal 8), transport (Goals 9 and 11), waste (Goal 11), housing (Goal 11), air quality (Goal 11), climate change (Goal 13), and land use (Goals 11 and 15) (UNDP, & UN-Habitat, 2016 ; UN-Habitat, 2016 ; Gómez-Álvarez et al., 2017 ; Galea et al., 2019 ; Andersson and Ghesquiere, 2020 ; UCLG, 2020 ; Hu et al., 2021 ). Starting with Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities ), eight additional goals were selected across economic, social, and environmental dimensions (Simon et al., 2016 ). The selected SDGs and their links to Goal 11 are summarized in Table 1  . In the economic dimension, Goals 8 (decent work and economic growt h) and 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure ) are closely related to Goal 11 (UN-Habitat, 2016 ). In the social dimension, Goals 1 (no poverty ), 3 (good health and well-being ), and 7 (affordable and clean energy ) are explicitly linked to Goal 11 (ICSU, 2017 ; Galea et al., 2019 ). Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation ), 13 (climate action ), and 15 (life on land ) are closely related to Goal 11 (Peng et al., 2017 ; Rodriguez et al., 2018 ).  3.3.1.2 Selected targets and indicators By reviewing local strategies and policies and applying the DPSIR model (Fig. 2 ), 19 targets and 39 indicators (five repeated) were selected to assess SDG progress and trends in the PRD (Tables 2 and 3   ). Economic and social activities are the main drivers of changes in the PRD. Pressures arise from resource consumption (e.g., land, water, and energy), discharge (e.g., greenhouse gases and waste), and natural disasters (e.g., landslides and typhoon events). The state of the PRD region can be examined through socioeconomics, access to basic services, water and air quality, land-use changes, and other themes. Research and development (R&D) and social security systems respond to sustainability issues (Table 3 ). Furthermore, 54 targets of the nine goals were selected to evaluate the SDG target interlinkages. As target interlinkages were assessed through expert judgment and literature review rather than limited indicator data, more targets were investigated and discussed beyond the 19 used for progress and trend assessment ().   3.3.2 Assessing SDGs’ progress and trend: indicator measurement The methods for evaluating regional and local SDG progress and trends involve three steps adopted from the European Commission and Eurostat (2019) : calculating the indicators’ compound annual growth rate (CAGR), categorizing trends with thresholds, and assessing goal-level trends with a scoring function. First, the CAGR is applied to assess the pace and direction of indicator evolution, which is a transparent and easy-to-use approach that avoids ad hoc judgments. The formula uses the first and last year’s data to calculate the average annual percentage change between the two time points (Equation (1) ).(1) C A G R = ( y t  y t 0    )  t t − t 0     − 1 ,     where t0  = base year, t = most recent year, yt0  = indicator value for the base year, and yt  = indicator value for the most recent year. Second, the observed change rate of indicator is compared to thresholds (Fig. 3  a): ≧1% annual change signifies “significant” progress towards or away from targets based on direction. If a change is in the desired direction, it means “significant progress towards targets.” If a change is in the wrong direction, this means “significant movement away from targets.” <1% annual change (including 0%) in the desired direction is considered “moderate progress towards targets,” <1% annual change against the desired direction is considered “moderate movement away from targets.” The 1% threshold presents a nuanced picture, with the indicators categorized into four groups. Third, the average indicator scores were calculated to assess the goal-level progress. Scores from 0.5 (best) to 4.5 (worst) were calculated for each indicator by applying CAGR to a scoring function (Fig. 3 b). This linear transformation has cut-offs at ±2.0% CAGR. The 0.0% CAGR group receives a score of 2.5. ≧2.0% CAGR towards the desired direction scores of 0.5 (4.5 if against). The mean scores of the indicators were then calculated for each goal, generating goal-level scores from 0.5 (best score) to 4.5 (worst score), which fell into four categories.  3.3.3 Assessing interlinks between targets: cross-impact matrix analysis and network analysis The methods for investigating interlinkages among targets across the nine goals in the PRD involve two steps: cross-impact matrix assessment and network analysis. First, the cross-impact assessment explored mutual target influences using 7-score scale from Nilsson et al. (2016) , ranging from +3 (most positive) to −3 (most negative) (Table 4  ). Positive scores indicated synergies, whereas negative scores indicated potential tradeoffs. Scores were assigned through expert surveys and literature review conducted by the co-authors. Experts were invited to score one target’s influence on another and provide insights based on their expertise. The co-authors also reviewed relevant documents to collect scoring evidence. The guiding question during this process is “how will actions to achieve this target will affect the achieving that target?”. Table 5   presents examples of scoring pairs of influencing and influenced targets. Second, the network analysis visualizes target interlinkages based on cross-impact scores in the Gephi tool. The scores for each target pair are inputs that reveal the systematic impacts. The out-degree, in-degree, and closeness centrality parameters were applied, as in previous SDG interlinkage research (Allen et al., 2019 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ). Specifically, the out-degree counts the outward connections of the target, reflecting its influence on others. The in-degree reflects the target’s exposure to others. Closeness centrality indicates the centrality of a node; nodes with higher values are closer to more nodes.    4 Results 4.1 Progress and trend of SDGs 4.1.1 Performance of indicators Table 6   presents the performances of the selected 39 indicators (including five repeated indicators). Specifically, 22 indicators showed significant progress towards targets (Targets 1.2, 1.3, 3.8, 6.4, 7.3, 8.1, 8.4, 8.8, 9.1, 9.5, and 11.6), two indicators showed moderate progress towards targets (Targets 6.3 and 11.3), two indicators experienced moderate movement away from targets (Targets 6.3 and 15.2), and 10 indicators showed significant movement away from targets (Targets 1.3, 1.5, 3.8, 6.1, 9.1, 11.5, and 11.6). Three indicators (Targets 11.2 and 13.2) were not assessed because of insufficient data.  4.1.2 Performance of goals The performance of the eight goals was evaluated for the PRD and its nine cities, excluding Goal 13 due to data insufficiency. Table 7   presents the goal performance of the PRD. The PRD made significant progress in achieving Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy ), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth ), and Goal 3 (good health and well-being ), which is consistent with Ouyang et al. (2021)  and Dong et al. (2022) . Moderate progress has occurred in Goal 1 (no poverty ) and Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation ), echoing the observed decline in socioeconomic inequalities (Liu et al., 2021 ) and water quality improvements (Zhao et al., 2020 ). No significant movements were observed in the PRD. However, a moderate movement away occurred for Goal 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure ), Goal 15 (life on land ), and Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communitie s), consistent with previous studies that reported rail transit deficiencies (Wang et al., 2022 ), a decline in forest and cultivated land (Zhang et al., 2021 ), and climatic risks (Chan et al., 2021 ). At the city level, both commonalities and differences emerged across the nine cities (Fig. 4  ). Significant progress has been made in Goal 8 (score: 0.50). Slight spatial differences occurred for Goal 1 (score: 1.50–3.10), Goal 3 (score: 0.73–1.60), Goal 6 (score: 1.44–2.65), and Goal 7 (score: 0.50–2.43). Specifically, Goal 1 in Shenzhen showed a distinct desired status and a positive trend of poverty reduction, partly attributed to a decline in the proportion of the poor urban population and improvement of public services (e.g., construction of hospitals and medical reform modes) in recent years (Xu et al., 2022a ). For Goal 3, distinct progress in Zhongshan aligns with its greater healthcare resources than cities such as Huizhou (Jiang et al., 2023 ). For Goal 6, Jiangmen received the best score, with an improvement in water quality and usage efficiency (e.g., a 17% decline in water consumption volume per RMB 10,000 of GDP from 2015 to 2018 (Statistic Bureau of Guangdong Province, 2015–2021 ). Moreover, for Goal 7, most cities improved their energy efficiency except for the slower gains in Zhaoqing and Foshan. Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Shenzhen, Zhongshan, and Zhuhai declined in energy consumption per 10,000 GDP by over 10% from 2014 to 2017 (Statistic Bureau of Guangdong Province, 2015–2021 ). The following three goals are observed with larger differences across cities: Goal 9 (score 0.50–4.32), Goal 11 (score: 2.34–4.16), and Goal 15 (score: 0.50–2.88). For Goal 9, despite a higher share of R&D expenditures in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, insufficient public transit progress weakened the overall Goal 9 gains (Statistic Bureau of Guangdong Province, 2015–2021 ; Wang et al., 2022 ). For Goal 11, Dongguan, Huizhou, Foshan, and Huizhou performed better than the others did. In particular, the sustainability issues that impede progress in Zhaoqing and Jiangmen include inadequate public transportation, park green space, and inefficient land use, lagging behind Goal 11 (Cao et al., 2019 ; Yang et al., 2019 ; Weng et al., 2022 ). For Goal 15, as indicated by the forest coverage in this study, Jiangmen performed better with forest as the primary land cover and effective afforestation efforts (Chen et al., 2021a ). In contrast, built-up expansion decreased forests in Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen (Chen et al., 2021a ).   4.2 Interlinks of SDG targets 4.2.1 Cross-impact matrix assessment Cross-impacts were assessed among the 54 targets across nine goals in the PRD context. The net influence measured with the seven-point scale provides an overview of the targets’ net impacts on other targets and whether they are strongly affected by progress in other targets. Table 8   presents the net influence and rankings for identifying the most and least influential targets. Initially, all targets were positively linked to each other. Negative impacts on the targets were not observed in this study. A target with a higher net influence suggests that it has a larger net positive influence on others; thus, it can be seen as a synergistic one that makes the realization of other targets easier. The top five most influential targets are: Target 15.1 (conservation, protection, and use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and services ), Target 15.9 (integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values ); Target 1.4 (equal rights and access to multiple resources and basic services ); Target 8.4 (improved resource efficiency and decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation ); and Target 9.4 (infrastructure upgrade, industry retrofitting, increased resource-use efficiency, and greater adaptation of environmentally-sound technologies and industrial processes ). The least influential targets are: Target 1.2 (reduce poverty ), Target 3.1 (reduce maternal morality ), Target 3.2 (end all preventable deaths under 5 years of age ), Target 3.6 (reduce road injuries and deaths ), and Target 6.5 (implement integrated water resources management ). Targets with a high net receiving influence suggest that they greatly rely on progress of others. The top five most influenced are: Target 1.2 (reduce poverty ); Target 15.1 (conservation, protection, and use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and services ); Target 15.5 (protect biodiversity and natural habitats ); Target 3.9 (reduce illnesses and deaths from hazardous chemicals and pollution ); and Target 8.1 (sustainable economic growth). On the contrary, the least five influenced are: Target 3.7 (universal access to sexual and reproductive care, family planning, and education ); Target 8.6 (promote youth employment, education, and training ); Target 8.7 (end modern slavery, trafficking, and child labor ); Target 8.10 (universal access to banking, insurance, and financial services ); and Target 15.9 (integrate ecosystem, and biodiversity in governmental planning ).  4.2.2 Network analysis Network analysis techniques are used to visualize and interpret the data and explore nuanced information to guide priority setting. Table 8  details the 54 target values and rankings for the in-degree, out-degree, and closeness centralities. Fig. 5   shows the overall network of the 200 target links, depicting the direction and strength of influence. Bigger nodes are more influential (higher out-degree), whereas darker nodes receive more influence (higher in-degree). Arrow color scales with cross-impact scores (e.g., positive: +1, +2, +3). The top four out-degree targets are: Target 15.9 (integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values ); Target 1.4 (equal rights and access to multiple resources and basic services ); Target 13.2 (integration of climate change response ); and Target 15.1 (conservation, protection, and use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and services ). The top four-closeness centrality targets are: Target 3.3 (fight communicable diseases ), Target 3.4 (reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health ), Target 3.7 (universal access to sexual and reproductive care, family planning, and education ), and Target 8.1 (sustainable economic growth ). The four highest in-degree targets are: Target 1.2 (reduce poverty ), Target 1.4 (equal rights and access to multiple resources and basic services ), Target 15.1 (conservation, protection, and use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and services ), and Target 8.1 (sustained economic growth ). Fig. 6   depicts the target networks with high scores in the cross-impact matrix or with high in-degree and out-degree scores. From a policymaker’s perspective, it is important to revisit policy areas and visualize the direction of influence of a specific target. For example, Target 13.2 directly influences eight other targets and is directly influenced by four targets (Fig. 6 g). A department responsible for climate mitigation measures (related to Target 13.2) would want to know which targets impact its progress on Target 13.2, to determine dependencies and foster collaboration. Additionally, the department would be interested in understanding how its target affects others, where resistance may arise, or where negotiation is needed.    5 Discussion 5.1 SDGs’ role in steering sustainable metropolitan development The PRD is a complex and dynamic metropolitan system facing various sustainability issues. Thus, the integrated SDG framework can guide the region towards a sustainable direction by optimizing efforts for effective implementation. This study assessed the SDG progress, trends, and interactions in the PRD, hypothesizing that addressing key sustainability issues and systemic impacts would refine prioritization and enhance implementation. First, the PRD region as a whole has made progress towards achieving eight goals (i.e., Goals 7, 8, 3, 1, and 6) related to energy and water consumption, employment, poverty, economic growth, health services, social security system, access to potable water, water quality, and wastewater disposal. For instance, intensity of energy consumption (Goal 7) has fallen by 15.7% from 2014 to 2017; and intensity of water consumption (Goal 6 and 8) declined 16.6% from 20150 to 2018; per capita GDP (Goal 8) grew to 0.13 million RMB in 2018 from 42848 RMB in 2005; the percentage of population covered by unemployment insurance, basic medical insurance, and occupational injury insurance (Goal 1) is respectively 46.0% (29.44 million persons), 84.3% (53.12 million persons), and 48.5% (30.56 million persons) in 20181  1 According to the Guangdong Statistical Yearbook (2015–2019), the energy consumption per RMB 10,000 GDP in 2014 and 2017 was 0.304 and 0.256 million tons of Standard Coal Equivalent, respectively; water consumption quantity per RMB 10,000 GDP in 2015 and 2018 was 110300 and 94700 m3 , respectively.   (Statistic Bureau of Guangdong Province, 2015–2019 ). This progress is attributed to the consistent efforts reflected in multiple plans. In 2008, the National Development and Reform Commission introduced an Outline of the Plan for Reform and Development of the Pearl River Delta Region (2008 –2020) , to provide guidance on industrial development, resource conservation, environmental protection, social services, and other policy areas. In 2010, the People’s Government of Guangdong Province issued several regional plans to enhance the integrated development of the PRD region, such as the Integrated Planning for Basic Public Services in the Pearl River Delta (2009 –2020) , Integrated Planning for Infrastructure Construction in the Pearl River Delta (2009 –2020), Integrated Planning for Industrial Distribution in the Pearl River Delta (2009 –2020) , Integrated Environmental Protection in the Pearl River Delta (2009 –2020) , and so on. In 2019, the Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Are a was introduced, which expanded the geographic scope and addressed coordination with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Macao Special Administrative Region, in addition to nine cities in the mainland of China. These plans have consistently addressed industrial development, energy efficiency improvement, water resource conservation and protection, improvement of social services (e.g., employment and health services), and social security (e.g., basic cost of living allowances and unemployment insurance). However, three goals showed undesired trends (Goals 9, 15, and 11), specifically in the areas of transportation, waste generation, air quality, forest management, and natural disasters. For example, the passenger volume decreased from 115.9 billion in 2013 to 7.08 billion in 2018 (Statistic Bureau of Guangdong Province, 2015–2021 ). The regional transportation system still needs to be improved (Goal 9), especially in terms of traffic capacity across the Pearl River estuary, construction of intercity railway networks, and congestion phenomena. Regarding environmental issues (Goal 11), per capita municipal waste generation grew by 17.86% from to 2013–20172  2 According to the Guangdong Statistical Yearbook (2015–2019), the per capita waste generation in 2013 and 2017 was 0.28 and 0.33 ton/person, respectively.   (Statistic Bureau of Guangdong Province, 2015–2021 ), pressuring waste management. Moreover, air pollution has been a key issue in the PRD since 1980 due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. Although SO2 , NO2,  and PM2.5  have declined since 2006, O3  concentrations have increased (Hu et al., 2021 ), thus affecting the annual percentages of good-quality days. Regarding natural disasters, the PRD is highly exposed to extreme climate events such as typhoons (Goals 1 and 11). In 2018, Typhoon Mangkhut caused 1.02 billion RMB in direct economic losses in four cities (Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Shenzhen, and Zhongshan) (Department of National Resources of Guangdong Province, 2016 ). Overall, SDGs can steer sustainable metropolitan development by optimizing implementation effectiveness. Progress relies on collective endeavors across cities and sectors. On the one hand, cities differ in their geographic locations, natural resource endowments, and fiscal capacity, leading to variations in their development status and potential. However, achieving positive progress towards development goals requires simultaneous collaborative improvements across multiple sectors. Thus, spatial integration and collaborative policy areas are imperative for achieving the SDGs.  5.2 Spatial integration for achieving SDGs Regarding individual cities, the progress and trend of the seven goals (Goals 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 15) vary across cities spatially, except for Goal 8, which shows similar progress (i.e., significantly positive progress). For instance, with regards to Goal 3, Huizhou’s health service supply (e.g., medical facilities and medical personnel) remains insufficient, with only 21 medical beds per 1,000 residents in 2018, much lower than Guangzhou’s 95 beds (Guangdong Statistical Yearbook, 2019). In contrast, highly urbanized cores like Shenzhen and Guangzhou face growing energy demands (Goal 7), water consumption (Goal 6), and increasing waste and wastewater generation (Goals 11 and 6) amid urbanization and industrialization (Department of Ecology and Environment of Guangdong Province, 2021 ). Industrializing cities such as Zhaoqing and Foshan experience similar challenges. Furthermore, Zhuhai is frequently exposed to extreme climatic events, hindering its progress towards Goals 11 and 1. Typhoons, such as Typhoons Nida, Hato, and Mangkhut in 2016 and 2021, caused over 4.5 billion RMB in damages, directly affecting over 7.5 million people, and damaging at least 950 ha of the aquaculture area (Department of National Resources of Guangdong Province, 2016–2021 ). This indicates that the performance of individual cities affects the overall SDG progress in the PRD. For instance, most cities are lagging behind in Goals 11 and 15 (score over 2.50, see Fig. 4 ), leading to relatively low progress towards these two goals in the PRD. Therefore, achieving sustainable metropolitan development requires joint efforts across regions. Performance differences suggest the potential for enhancing spatial integration through metropolitan arrangements. Dialogue and coordination among local governments across cities could avoid fragmentation, negative spillovers, underutilized land, and disparities while harnessing opportunities (Andersson and Ghesquiere, 2020 ). Key sustainability issues, such as air and water pollution, require cross-border solutions, and opportunities exist on the metropolitan scale. For example, improvements in the transportation network linking core cities (e.g., Shenzhen and Guangzhou) and other cities (e.g., Zhaoqing and Jiangmen) could create job opportunities, improve access to public services, and curb urban sprawl.  5.3 Collaboration across policy areas for achieving SDGs The results of the cross-impact matrix and network analysis show that the selected SDGs are mostly synergistic in the PRD, indicating the huge potential to leverage synergies across policy areas. For instance, actions to protect territorial and freshwater ecosystems and services (Target 15.1; Fig. 6 h) synergize with multiple targets. As a coastal and estuarine region, the conservation and protection of the PRD’s diverse ecosystems (e.g., wetlands, rivers and lakes, forests, cropland, and marine) would contribute to a sustainable water supply (Targets 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6), land resource management (Targets 11.7, 15.2, 15.3, and 15.4), and biodiversity protection (Target 15.5). Another example is that improving energy efficiency (Target 7.3) benefits greenhouse gas emission reduction (Targets 13.2 and 11.6) and green, low-carbon economic growth (Target 8.4). Conversely, issues in one sector may undermine efforts in other sectors to achieve their goals. For instance, expanding population coverage through social protection (Target 1.3) helps reduce urban poverty, but insufficient disaster preparation and response to natural disasters (Targets 11.5 and 1.5) could re-entrench poverty (Target 1.2). These insights into target interactions enable identifying collaboration opportunities and clarifying governmental responsibilities during the planning process of collaborative actions. Decision-makers should determine how to best realize this potential in collaboration with other actions (Weitz et al., 2018 ; Wu et al., 2022b ). The network analysis of how a certain target influences other targets (or is influenced by others) provides useful entry points for discussions among affected areas and an overview of potential strategic collaboration across different departments.   6 Conclusions This study conducted an integrated assessment for SDGs of the PRD metropolitan region at both sub-national and urban scales, applying DPSIR framework to evaluate SDG progress and interactions. The findings are as follows: (1) At the metropolitan level, the PRD as a whole made progress towards five of eight goals (Goals 7, 8, 3, 1, and 6), while three goals (Goals 9, 15, and 11) showed moderate movement away from the desired direction. (2) At the city level, the progress and trend of seven goals (Goals 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 15) exhibited spatial differences across nine individual cities in the region, with Goal 8 showing a similar level of progress across all cities. (3) Synergistic interlinkages were evident among 54 targets within the nine SDGs, identifying highly influential targets (e.g., top four are Targets 15.9, 1.4, 13.2, and 15.1) and highly influenced targets (e.g., top four are Targets 1.2, 1.4, 15.1, and 8.1). This study has several important policy implications. First, population growth, economic development, and rapid urbanization emerge as key drivers, exerting pressures on energy and water consumption, pollutant discharges, transportation, environmental degradation, and disaster management. Metropolitan governments should prioritize transportation infrastructure, environmental management, and building resilience and livability. Second, differences in SDG progress across cities affected the overall SDG achievements in the PRD, indicating insufficient spatial integration. Metropolitan and local governments should collectively enhance dialogue and coordination across cities by sharing best practices in health services, energy efficiency, and disaster management. Third, inadequate collaboration across policy areas hinders the achievement of the SDGs. Understanding target interactions enables the identification of opportunities for collaboration. Particular attention should be paid to fields that exert positive systemic impacts, such as ecosystem and environmental protection, equal access to resources and basic services, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Meanwhile, fields that are more easily affected are recommended for proper monitoring and management, such as poverty reduction, access to resources and basic services, ecosystem protection, and economic growth. The integrated SDG framework guides metropolitan regions towards sustainability by prioritizing efforts on key issues, enhancing synergies and collaboration across policy areas, and promoting sustainable development beyond administrative boundaries. This study addresses the UN and other international organizations’ desire to localize SDGs at the sub-national and local levels, the need to find pathways for sustainable metropolitan development, and the importance of policy coherence for sustainability. We demonstrated how the SDGs can be contextualized and incorporated into the metropolitan planning and management. This approach utilizing DPSIR framework provides evidence-based insights into SDG progress and interlinks to support effective and coherent SDG prioritization and implementation in metropolitan regions. Despite constant efforts to enhance the robustness of this study, it has several limitations. First, while investigating insights into selected SDGs’ performance and interlinks, it provides insufficient evidence to support decision-making and project evaluation at the county and neighborhood levels. Second, due to data availability constraints and the scope of research, this study focused on a specific set of SDGs selected based on a literature review. However, other SDGs, such as Goals 4 (quality education ) and 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions ), are also highly relevant to sustainable development at the sub-national and urban scales. However, this study was primarily conducted for illustrative purposes. The data used in this study illustrate only the analytical procedure. For future research, it is recommended to explore SDG implementation at finer scales, such as the county and neighborhood levels, deriving theoretical knowledge and empirical insights to improve local change measures. Moreover, it is suggested to expand to more highly relevant goals and targets through field surveys, stakeholder engagement, and the application of multi-source data (e.g., big earth data) to facilitate the comprehensive monitoring of SDG progress and interlinkages across multiple levels.
