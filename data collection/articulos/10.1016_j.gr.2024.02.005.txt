                  The United States, as the world's second-largest polluter, emitted a staggering 4.7 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2020. During the Leaders’ Climate Summit, the US president articulated precise targets for combating climate change, notably a 50 to 52 percent reduction in net CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. Consequently, it becomes imperative to identify the pivotal factors that are driving this intensified dedication to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, it is vibrant to determine the basic causes propelling the intensified interest in meeting SDGs 7 and 13. From this perspective, this study explores the dynamic link between energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, and economic complexity index on CO2 emissions and ecological footprint in the United States from 1980 to 2020. The dynamic Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) simulations and Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) techniques are applied for long-medium and short-run causal association among the variables. Our empirical evidence shows that energy transition, fossil fuel energy, and economic complexity increase CO2 emissions and ecological footprint. On the other hand, green innovation reduces CO2 emissions and ecological impact only in the long term. The pragmatic outcomes suggest that authorities should inhibit Fossil Fuel Energy, concentrate on energy transitions, and include more renewable sources in the US energy mix. The findings would assist the United States in meeting SDGs 7 and 13.

Sinha Graphical abstract       The United States, as the world's second-largest polluter, emitted a staggering 4.7 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2020. During the Leaders’ Climate Summit, the US president articulated precise targets for combating climate change, notably a 50 to 52 percent reduction in net CO2  emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. Consequently, it becomes imperative to identify the pivotal factors that are driving this intensified dedication to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, it is vibrant to determine the basic causes propelling the intensified interest in meeting SDGs 7 and 13. From this perspective, this study explores the dynamic link between energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, and economic complexity index on CO2  emissions and ecological footprint in the United States from 1980 to 2020. The dynamic Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) simulations and Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) techniques are applied for long-medium and short-run causal association among the variables. Our empirical evidence shows that energy transition, fossil fuel energy, and economic complexity increase CO2  emissions and ecological footprint. On the other hand, green innovation reduces CO2  emissions and ecological impact only in the long term. The pragmatic outcomes suggest that authorities should inhibit Fossil Fuel Energy, concentrate on energy transitions, and include more renewable sources in the US energy mix. The findings would assist the United States in meeting SDGs 7 and 13.

To avert additional global temperature rises, nations must pledge more stringent curbs on warming emissions. To accomplish this, global leaders gathered in Glasgow for COP26 on October 31st, 2021. The program is managed by establishing an agreement with the least attempting nations to control the pace. A strong verbal pledge was made at analogous meetings in Kyoto in 1997, Copenhagen in 2009, and Paris in 2015, but the result was not visible. Nations agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit greenhouse gases well below 2 Degrees Celsius. The United Kingdom is pushing for a deal to “consign coal plants to oblivion,” the United States wants a net-zero accord, and the Association of Small Island States (AOSIS) wants global warming to stay below 1.5 °C (Ellis and Henderson, 2017 ). The world’s two greatest CO2  emitters, the United States and China, have pledged to take steps to cut emissions at the COP26 summit (Vaughan, 2021 ). Whereas (Kiely, 2021 ) stated that over twenty U.S. states that have made climate promises in response to the Paris Agreement also play an important role in reducing U.S. emissions, they mostly fail to achieve them. As shown in a December 2020 estimate, these areas were not on track to reach key emissions objectives for 2025 and 2030. However, just a few states achieved significant gains this year: Washington State approved the nation’s most stringent environmental pollution regulations in the spring, establishing an example for other states to follow. One of the country’s top polluters, Pennsylvania, is nearing the completion of a multi-state campaign to reduce emissions from power plants. Similarly, Illinois passed a renewable energy law that calls for the phase-out of all fossil-fuel facilities by 2045. In contrast, several states with climate objectives, including New Mexico, Oregon, and Colorado, have a long way before turning pledges into legislation. The United States reiterated its commitment to meeting climate change targets, most notably via an ambitious new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that aims to reduce US emissions by 50–52 % from 2005 levels by 2030. While the goal is high, various assessments have demonstrated that it is easily doable, lending much-needed credibility to the US pledge. Since then, the administration has launched many programs to bring the nation closer to that goal (Arostegui, 2021 ). The United States has seen exceptional economic progression during the last two epochs. The United States economy deals with two major issues: the greenhouse effect and ecological asset misuse. With 5.01 million kilotons (kt) of CO2  emissions in 2016, the United States ranked second internationally (Worldometer, 2022 ). Similarly, in 2016, the country imported twenty of ninety major goods from a range of distinct countries. Notwithstanding these imports, the United States is the 7th largest bearer of natural resources globally (Atlas, 2018 ). Due to the evident mounting demand for energy, the world’s CO2  emissions tendency is wreaking havoc on the ecosystem. Global energy consumption climbed by 2.1 percent in 2017, up from 0.9 percent in 2016, with a five-year average growth of 0.9 percent. The global growth in energy usage is 3.1 %, significantly countless than the aggregate boost in construction (EIA, 2020a ). In 2019, the United States produced roughly 4.12 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh), with coal accounting for 2580 kWh (62.7 %) and natural gas for 1582 kWh (38.4 %). Renewable energy sources generated 720 kWh (17.5 %) of the total energy (EIA 2020). Carbon intensity from the US power industry was augmented by 2.7 %, from 5130 million metric tonnes (MMT) in 2017 to 5269 MMT in 2018. Over time, the country’s overall carbon intensity has fallen at a comparable rate. In 2018, it was 0.1 %, paralleled to 2.9 % in 2017. On the consumer side, energy depletion in the US amplified from 300 million British thermal units (BTUs) in 2017 to 309 million in 2018. Similarly, (IEA, 2018 ) reported, global energy-related CO2  emissions experienced a significant increase of 1.4 %, amounting to 460 million tonnes (Mt), and ultimately reaching an all-time high of 32.5 gigatonnes (Gt). This growth in emissions occurred following three years of stagnant levels and stands in stark contrast to the substantial reductions required to align with the targets set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. According to (UN, 2017 ), if CO2  emissions are not significantly reduced, the 2015 Paris accord objectives of limiting increasing temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to early industrial phases of 1.5 degrees Celsius would be missed. If the carbon reduction objective is accomplished, enormous social and material consequences will be achieved. As a result, sustainable development among policymakers and its causal mechanisms remains a significant research goal. Energy transition has become a more reliable pathway to environmental progress. Numerous studies have been published on the relationship between renewables and CO2  emissions. As the world’s economic hub and the highest polluter, the United States has a special and essential duty to confront climate disasters. Their efforts have a major effect and can influence other people’s agreements. With this argument, we contend that, despite the rising corpus of literature on environmental issues, the scientific research on energy transition, fossil fuel energy, eco-innovation, and economic complexity is still in its early phases. By this motivation, we seek to scientifically examine the many aspects that may contribute to accomplishing the COP26 net-zero emissions objective of the United States. In this context, GHG and CO2  emissions have previously been employed as a proxy for environmental concerns. Also, the EFP is frequently exercised to assess the environment. (Ali et al., 2017; Bélaïd and Youssef, 2017; Mikayilov et al., 2018 ) stated that CO2  emissions are not always a useful environmental estimate. In contradiction to this backdrop, the current research employs CO2  emissions and ecological footprint to indicate environmental quality for a more reliable and firm environmental policy. Also, this study applies innovative econometric techniques and variables, such as energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, and economic complexity, on CO2  emissions and EFP in the US, which may consider novel factors in shaping environmental policy. Therefore, our research differs from other studies and makes various important contributions: (i), In 2020, the United States ranked as the second-largest contributor to global pollution, emitting a substantial 4.7 billion metric tonnes of CO2 . To address this pressing issue, the US President set forth clear objectives during the Leaders' Climate Summit. These objectives include a noteworthy commitment to reduce net emissions by 50–52 % from 2005 levels by the year 2030. Consequently, it is imperative to identify the pivotal factors that are driving increased attention to achieving SDGs 7 and 13, which focus on ensuring access to clean and affordable energy (SDG 7) and taking urgent action to combat climate change (SDG 13). (ii) This study focuses on aspects that have previously gone unnoticed in the literature, despite using a variety of factors, a separate timeline, and a range of study approaches, these investigations failed to reach a certain conclusion. In pursuit of the objective, ecological footprint and CO2  emissions serve as key metrics for assessing the environmental quality in the United States. (iii), This research marks the pioneering effort to investigate the interplay between energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, economic complexity, CO2  emissions, and EFP in the United States from 1980 to 2020. (iv), For analysis, the majority of studies addressing utilized simple ARDL approaches or other cointegration methods to examine short and long-term measurement, this research adopts a distinctive approach. Specifically, we utilize two methodologies include dynamic ARDL simulations, lately developed by (Jordan and Philips, 2018a ), and Frequency Domain Causality. The novel advantage of DARDL allows for the exploration of how real fluctuations in independent variables can influence outcomes, whereas FDC validates the interplay of these elements in the short, medium, and long term. Surprisingly, no previous research has used DARDL simulations for both positive and negative changes and FDC analyses to evaluate the three-way effects of energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, and economic complexity on CO2  emissions and EFP in the United States. (v), Developing countries often look to advanced economies like the United States for tactics and approaches. Therefore, this research study provides a thorough and policy-oriented approach to addressing the fundamental imperatives of the United States SDGs 7 and 13. Also, the study is based on a problem-driven paradigm that emphasizes the critical need to battle climate change and cut carbon emissions. Based on practical facts and rigorous research, the following essential policy proposals are critical to promoting the nation's increased commitment to sustainability. Finally, the policy suggestions provide a well-informed and organized roadmap for the United States to accomplish its climate commitments while also supporting a sustainable and resilient future. Following a comprehensive data analysis, this research is anticipated to provide helpful information to policymakers, assisting them in the design of plans to support the United States in reaching SDGs 7 and 13. The remainder of this study is organized as shadows: Section 2   defines the content and techniques, while Section 3   discusses empirical findings and discussion. Section 4   presents a conclusion with policy ramifications.  2 Literature review In recent years, global warming has emerged as a prominent global environmental concern. The recent COP26 conference highlighted greenhouse gas (GHG) and CO2  emissions as the primary drivers of global warming. In response to the increasing emphasis on various environmental aspects by academics and politicians, we have conducted a comprehensive review of related research, organizing our findings into three distinct sections as outlined below: 2.1 Energy Transition, fossil fuel Energy, and environment Renewable energy is energy that is provided by nature and produced by solar and other biological capital such as biomass, photovoltaic, winds, hydropower, and thermal, which might also reduce carbon pollution. According to (Mensah et al., 2018 ), an increasing number of nations creating green power generation systems to address the problem of CO2  pollution likely to increase in tandem with global economic development. Several prior research looked at renewable energy consumption (REC) and environmental pollution. (Yi et al., 2023 ) observed that both renewable energy and fossil fuel energy can lead to increased CO2  emissions over time in the United States. According to (Chen et al., 2019 ) investigated the link between CO2  emissions in China, GDP, NRE, RE, and international trade. They determined that NRE and GDP increase emissions over time. (Ehigiamusoe et al., 2020 ) shown that economic growth and the usage of NRE increase CO2  emissions, while RE decreases CO2  emissions. Also (Ramzan et al., 2023b ), financial expansion increases energy consumption while decreasing pollution. (Ozturk et al., 2023a ) revealed environmental governance considerably lessens material footprint. According to (Toumi and Toumi, 2019 ), economic growth, CO2  emissions, and REC might be significant to Saudi authorities and the SDGs. While the results of (Ramzan et al., 2023a ), NRE causes environmental deterioration in the US. Numerous research focused on the time series characteristics of environmental consequences, namely the incorporation of CO2  emissions. Since the principal synthetic greenhouse emissions in the environment are CO2  emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, real strategies to limit CO2  emissions are required to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Several studies have firmly established that the use of fossil fuel energy in many economies is a major factor in driving CO2  emissions included (Ozturk et al., 2023b; Razzaq et al., 2023; Sinha et al., 2020 ). Nevertheless, (Sinha and Shahbaz, 2018 ) reported renewable energy facilities lowering CO2  emissions in India. Though various studies (Cho and Sohn, 2018 ) proposed that moderate technologies replace fossil combustion and gradually reduce carbon pollution, besides (Salman et al., 2019 ) contended that minimal energy sources such as renewable and solar could replace fossil energy. As per (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2022 ), solar energy systems and nuclear energy reactors require a significant reliance on fossil energy via the excavation, processing, and reprocessing of comparable resources, hence reducing CO2  pollution and raising the temp.  2.2 Green innovation and environmental degradation Green innovation has lately sparked increased attention in the literature on environmental issues. Pioneering efforts address the significance of eco-innovation initiated by (Fussler and James, 1996 ). Additionally, (M. Zhang et al., 2023 ) defined eco-innovation as an innovation that reduces the environmental effect of goods and industrial practices. Prior research has reached an agreement on the relevance of eco-innovation in alleviating environmental deterioration. According to (Albaker et al., 2023 ), eco-innovation helps economies minimize the cost of employing renewable energy sources while facilitating the transition from FFE to RE sources. Furthermore, they contended that eco-innovation encourages carbon capture and storage. Simultaneously, (Ning et al., 2023 ) emphasized the significance of carbon capture and storage in lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, (Iqbal et al., 2021 ) said that eco-innovation encourages replacing obsolete environmental technology with current and ecologically friendly ones, lowering harmful emissions. On the empirical side, (Sun et al., 2021 ) used data from 1980 to 2018 to study the impacts of eco-innovation, GDP, and globalization on carbon emissions in the US. The quantile ARDL illustrates the critical importance of eco-innovation in long-term emissions management. These findings are exclusively valid for the lower and upper quantiles, indicating that the impressions of eco-innovation are validated in the face of upper and lower CO2  emissions. As a result, environmental technology innovation seems to be an effective weapon for combating climate change in the US. Finally, (Wang et al., 2020 ) investigated the environmental consequences of eco-innovation in G7 nations. The findings are consistent with previous research, lowering environmental pollutants in the short and long-term.  2.3 Economic complexity and environmental degradation Greenhouse gases, alongside climate change, are a growing issue; these difficulties have increased attention to environmental deterioration and its effects. Several research studies have scrutinized the bond between CO2  and ECI. (Doğan Buhari et al., 2019 ) examined ECI and CO2  emissions relation in 55 states and confirmed EKC theory in high-income countries, despite a U-shaped link amid CO2  and income levels being lower and progressed in middle-income countries. The scientists also discovered that ECI increases emissions in poorer countries but decreases environmental damage in high-income countries. Whereas (Boleti et al., 2019 ), ECI reduces total environment discarded by enhancing particular air quality measures such as elusive specific substances and CO2 . The EKC hypothesis for the 88 countries confirmed by (Neagu and Teodoru, 2019 ) noticed an inverted U-shaped connection between ECI and CO2  in six of the twenty-five European countries. They claimed that ECI has a rising impact on greenhouse gas emissions in 25 EU member states. (Chu, 2020 ) discovered an inverted-U link between ECI and CO2  in 118 states. (Swart and Brinkmann, 2019 ) studied the association between ECI, income, and four separate emission indicators. Though ECI gives a more inclusive view of a nation’s export markets’ diversification and interconnection (Doğan et al., 2020 ). ECI’s capacity to define cross-country differences in GDP, as well as its forecast volume for financial activity, is significant. Recently, (Abbasi et al., 2021c ) analyzed the link between ECI, tourism, and GDP on CO2,  applying data from the top 18 economic complexity nations from 1990 to 2019. They applied CS-ARDL and Dumitrescu and Hurlin Granger causality tests. The Pesaran and Yamagata slope heterogeneity and Pesaran CD test findings corroborate the existence of a cross-sectional unit bond and slope heterogeneity among nations, whereas progressive long-term and short-term rapports between ECI, GDP, and CO2  were discovered. Several research studies have found the reasons for the distressing environment in different countries and locations (Dar et al., 2022; Fang et al., 2023; Kan et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Xi et al., 2022 ). According to our indulgence, no research, notably in the US, analyses the environmental implications of CO2  pollution and ecological footprint by employing ET, FFE, GI, and ECI. A brief review of existing literature investigates the roots, pathways, lengthy and narrow effects, different econometric techniques, and linked parameters used in analyses centered on the specific time - frame from various countries to clarify in-depth insights into the potential factors affecting the environment. However, there is ambiguity exists, for instance (Ulucak and Apergis, 2018 ) stated, CO2  emissions might be a poor indicator for resource stocks, including oil, soil, mining, and forests. Correspondingly, (Solarin and Bello, 2018 ) described that, for long-term growth, we need an integrative model of environmental mortification. Given that, the current study applies a modern econometric approach, and new factors, such as energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, and economic complexity, with CO2  emissions and EFP in the United States, could be considered superior in this systematic study.   3 Model and procedures 3.1 Dataset and variable selection This study examines energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, economic complexity, EFP, and CO2  emissions in the US from 1980 to 2020. There are several benefits of adopting EFP as an environmental component. It investigates the environmental benefits and drawbacks of industrial and utilization processes. For example, the land required to yield an agricultural product indirectly affects other variables (such as the resources used in the end product) (Ulucak and Bilgili, 2018 ). As a result, EFP considers both direct and indirect consequences, such as land use and resources. However, in recent COP26, fossil fuel energy has been declared a major issue for policymakers who strive to increase environmental sustainability. There is a great deal of public interest in employing energy transition, which provides energy without affecting the environment (Kashif Abbasi et al., 2020 ). Besides, Following the COP26 agreement, governments worldwide are investing in eco-friendly equipment to diminish CO2  emissions. Environmental-related technical innovation considerably cuts carbon emissions while improving industry and economic performance (Abbasi et al., 2021b ). Firms use environmental innovation to reach economic proficiency in the trade of commodities. Environmental modernization mixes effective resource usage and cost-cutting measures for the environment. As a result, ecological innovation is likely to have an adverse effect on the environment (Khan et al., 2020 ). Following a general understanding that economic complexity may properly anticipate economic expansion and represent a skill-based, knowledge-based, and innovative production, the choice of economic complexity as an influencing variable was decided (Hausmann et al., 2014 ). A higher degree of ECI indicates increased economic complexity, structural change, and product diversity of exports (Ahmad et al., 2021 ). Following a rigorous analysis of previous research, we identify the most relevant parameters contributing to environmental sustainability while avoiding mislaid variable partiality in the econometric evaluation. Table 1   displays the comprehensive information and measurements for the integrated variables.  3.2 Model specification The empirical analysis followed the earlier studies (Abbasi et al., 2021a; Zhang et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022 ) to examine the links between energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovations, economic complexity index with CO2  emissions, and ecological footprint. Initially, all series are changed into logarithmic form to reduce heteroscedasticity. The Dynamic ARDL simulation technique, as validated by (Jordan and Philips, 2018b ), is employed for the examination of substantial changes in controlled variables resulting from control factors. The model is found to be suitable for data series that exhibit stability at an integrated order of I(0) and I(1), except I(2). Furthermore, the DARDL simulations method generates graphical predictions of both positive and negative volatility in response to the variations in control parameters and their impact on the controlled variable. When compared to the traditional ARDL bounds test proposed by (Pesaran et al., 2001 ), the DARDL model has numerous noteworthy benefits. The ARDL bounds test technique has been widely used in several research, owing to its capacity to estimate both long- and short-run connections simultaneously, while allowing variables with mixed orders of integration (I(0) and I(1)). Also, the determination of cointegration in the bounds test technique is based on the evaluation of F and t-statistics. When the estimated F and t-statistics greatly surpass the upper critical bound value, cointegration is proven. These test statistics can be generated from the following unconstrained error correction model. Nonetheless, using mixed lag lengths and variations in the ARDL approach adds complexity to the estimate process. Another notable advantage of the DARDL boundaries test, as reported by (Pata and Balsalobre-Lorente, 2022 ), is its applicability for evaluating small sample datasets. Additionally, the DARDL technique avoids this complication by providing a graphical depiction of the influence of an independent variable on the dependent variable while maintaining other variables constant. In other words, the DARDL model can potentially be used to forecast negative and positive shifts in variables while concurrently determining long- and short-run correlations. Fig. 1   portrays a pictographic representation of the methodological approach. Before using DARDL, we perform unit root tests for stationarity, which helps to prevent spurious regression; no evidence should be left undetermined (Xu et al., 2023; L. Zhang et al., 2023 ). At I(0) and I(1), we calculated the stationarity of each variable. The series is called the unit root if it is not stationary at the level; if it is stationary at the first difference, it is called integrated by I. (1). DARDL can be performed with just I(0) or I(I) stationary variables. Several tests have been conducted to determine the stationarity, including (Dickey and Fuller, 1979; Kwiatkowski et al., 1992; Phillips and Perron, 1988 ). The following is the calculating technique for analyzing the relationships across the research variables: Model-1:(1) CO  2 t   = α 0  + β 1  ET  t     + β 2  FFE  t     + β 3  GI  t     + β 4  ECI  t     + μ t       Model-2:(2) EFP  t  = α 0  + β 1  ET  t     + β 2  FFE  t     + β 3  GI  t     + β 4  ECI  t     + μ t      where t infers period, CO2  (carbon dioxide emissions), EFP (ecological footprint), ET (energy transition), FFE (fossil fuel energy), GI (green innovation), and ECI (economic complexity index). While (α0 ) is constant, (β1  to β4 ) regressors’ coefficients and (μ t    ) is an error term.  3.3 ARDL bounds test The bounds test is performed to measure long-term estimates. The following ARDL approach inspects the long-run link amid the variables: Model-1:Δ C O  2 t   = φ 0  + φ 1  CO  2 t - i   + φ 2  ET  t - i   + φ 3  FFE  t - i   + φ 4  GI  t - i   + φ 5  ECI  t - i   +     (3) ∑ i = 1  q  β 1  Δ C O  2 t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 2  Δ E T  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 3  Δ F F E  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 4  Δ G I  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 5  Δ E C I  t - i   + ε t       Model-2:Δ E F P  t  = φ 0  + φ 1  EFP  t - i   + φ 2  ET  t - i   + φ 3  FFE  t - i   + φ 4  GI  t - i   + φ 5  ECI  t - i   +     (4) ∑ i = 1  q  β 1  Δ E F P  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 2  Δ E T  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 3  Δ F F E  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 4  Δ G I  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 5  Δ E C I  t - i   + ε t         Where ß denotes long-term association, t–i is the ideal lag selected by AIC, and Δ denotes the first difference. The F-statistic value would determine whether we agree or deny the H0  hypothesis. Rendering to (Pesaran et al., 2001 ), the parameters for long-run correlation predicted by F-statistic are greater than the criterion bound; while less than implies no correlation, and the anticipated F-statistic is between the confidence interval and the called vague result. (Abbasi et al., 2021a ) verified that the ARDL model might be used with little data of I(0) or I(I). For response and control variables, several lags may be used. We use the Akaike-Information-Criterion (AIC) to choose appropriate lags. The following is the error-correction model for the short-term ARDL: Model-1:CO  2 t   + α 0  + ∑ i = 1  q  β 1  Δ C O  2 t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 2  Δ E T  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 3  Δ F F E  t - i       (5) + ∑ i = 1  q  β 4  Δ G I  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 5  Δ E C I  t - i   + φ ECT  t - i   + ε t        Model-2:EFP  t  + α 0  + ∑ i = 1  q  β 1  Δ E F P  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 2  Δ E T  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 3  Δ F F E  t - i       (6) + ∑ i = 1  q  β 4  Δ G I  t - i   + ∑ i = 1  q  β 5  Δ E C I  t - i   + φ ECT  t - i   + ε t         In equation-5 and 6, β signifies the short-run divergence, and ECT is the Error Correction Term verifying the volatility adjustment speed; the normal ECT ranges from (-1 to 0). The ECT should be adversarial and measuredly significant, indicating that slight change would be returned to equilibrium the following round.  3.4 DARDL simulations Due to short-term and long-term repercussions of basic ARDL, a novel DARDL technique developed by (Jordan and Philips 2018), forecasts, rouses, and inexorably magnets forecasts on the explained variable in one regressor while the remaining explanatory parameters remain untouched. The data series should be cointegrated to meet the essential requirements of the DARDL model. The graphs are frequently used to check the true shift of the regressors and their impact on the response parameter. The following is the ARDL-bound systematic process: Model-1:Δ C O  2 y   = α 0  + θ 0  CO  2 t - 1   + β 1  Δ E T  t  + θ 1  ET  t - 1   + β 2  Δ F F E  t  + θ 2  FFE  t - 1   +     (7) β 3  Δ G I  t  + θ 3  GI  t - 1   + β 4  Δ E C I  t  + θ 4  ECI  t - 1   + ε t        Model-2:Δ E F P  y  = α 0  + θ 0  EFP  t - 1   + β 1  Δ E T  t  + θ 1  ET  t - 1   + β 2  Δ F F E  t  + θ 2  FFE  t - 1   +     (8) β 3  Δ G I  t  + θ 3  GI  t - 1   + β 4  Δ E C I  t  + θ 4  ECI  t - 1   + ε t         3.5 Spectral Granger causality Conclusively, we use the spectral causality check to assess the causal link, verifying the model’s consistency. Unlike the traditional Granger causality check (Breitung and Candelon, 2006 ), the estimate approach used in this study allows for validating the empirical sculpt at certain time intervals, permitting policy intervention. Unrestrained threshold models are not possible since the technique is time-limited. The FDC equation is as follows:(9) x t  = α 1  χ t - 1   + . . .  α p  X t - p   ⋯ + β 1  Y t - 1   + β p  Y t - p   + ε 1 t        The linear restraint supports H0 . However, (t) is the passage of time, (p) is lag, and (εt ) are error terms determined by (α1 ) and (β1 ).   4 Analysis findings and discussion Table 2   displays descriptive statistics for the variables as well as the variance inflation factor (VIF) scores. The outcome contains mean maximum, minimum, and standard deviation data descriptions. Unlike reporting the immediate statistics, the Jarque-Bera test displays the height of Kurtosis and the trend in standard distribution when the average EFP and CO2  emissions are (15.45, 21.68) greater than other factors. Also, a substantial energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, and economic complexity affinity. In comparison to the immediate statistics, the Jarque-Bera test indicates Kurtosis and the standard distribution trend, with the mean CO2  emissions 15.45 greater than other parameters. The VIF analysis reveals no evidence of multicollinearity in either model since the VIF scores of all explanatory variables and the mean VIF scores are less than 10. The outcome demonstrates a significant ecological footprint, the use of fossil fuels, renewable energy, and globalization. In addition, the data trend of variables is presented in Fig. 2  . To assess the stochastic aspects of the series, ADF-PP and KPSS unit root tests were utilized (unit roots and stationarity). Table 3   presents the findings, which show that ADF, PP, and KPSS all rejected the hypothesis H0. Moreover, neither the ADF nor the PP H0 hypotheses are rejected at I(0); rather, I(1) is rejected first. Whereas only ET, and ECI were stationary at the first difference, KPSS proved stationarity constant and trend at level. The bounds test was executed to observe the long-term link amid the parameters. Table 4   spectacles the outcomes of the bounds inspection. The estimated findings imply that the research parameters have a long link because the observed F- and t-statistic values in Model-1 and Model-2 are above the upper limit. 4.1 DARDL outcomes (Model-1 & Model-2) The DARDL simulations for Model-1 and Model-2 are shown in Table 5  . The empirical findings reveal that energy transition has a long-term and short-term beneficial and significant influence on environmental deterioration in the United States. As a result, a 1 % surge in ET considerably increases CO2  emissions by 0.24 % and 27 % for Model 1 and 0.07 % in the short-run for Model 2, respectively. In a complicated energy system, there may be indirect, paradoxical consequences that temporarily increase carbon emissions. For instance, the development and installation of renewable energy infrastructure may need the use of energy and resources, resulting in an immediate spike in emissions. The results are consistent with (Yi et al., 2023 ) findings that renewable energy has a positive impact on CO2  emissions, implying that the United States has not yet reached the point where renewable energy sources are adequate to cut CO2  emissions. While the findings are inconsistent with the conclusions of (Menyah and Wolde-Rufael, 2010 ), who found no relationship between RE and CO2  emissions in the US. While it is beyond expectations to investigate the various reasons for the energy transition’s failure to cut CO2  emissions, many factors may have facilitated it. Compared to other energies, the percentage of energy transition in overall energy consumption is only 12 % in the United States has not grown much (EIA, 2020a ). Despite the fact that significant wisdom investments are required to ensure the widespread use of renewables. On the other hand, the amplified usage of fossil fuels leads to CO2  emissions. Specifically, a 1 % spike in FFE results in 1.53, 1.49, 1.77, and 1.68 percent pollution for Model-1 and 2 in the short-term and long-term. A straightforward way to achieve low-emissions levels is to prioritize energy transition (renewable sources) and to diminish the dependence on FFE in the United States of America's energy mix, which is currently 35 %, 10 %, and 34 % petroleum, coal, and natural gas, respectively (EIA, 2020b ). Therefore, focusing on renewable energies and consolidating appropriate technology into manufacturing processes are critical for a cleaner ecosystem. Furthermore, given that deriving energy from clean energy sources costs approximately much more than producing power from fossil fuel sources, the US authorities should motivate and finically back organizations, academic institutions, and research scholars to work on lowering the cost of generating power from all forms of renewables, as well as the implementation of environmental protective measures. The outcomes corroborate those of (Abbasi et al., 2022; Dogan and Ozturk, 2017; Dogan and Seker, 2016 ) confirming the relevance of renewable and fossil energy in environmental pollution. Also, green innovation coefficients are negative, confirming the only long-run association with CO2  emissions for Panels 1 and 2. Implies 1 % upsurge in GI drops CO2  emissions by 0.11 % (Model-1) and 0.15 % (Model-2) while insignificant in the short-run for both models. It is crucial to highlight that the influence of green innovation on CO2 emissions may not be instantaneous, and the long-term relationship shows that the full advantages of these breakthroughs may take time to be realized. Furthermore, the negative coefficients show that a rise in green innovation is related to a drop in CO2 emissions, which aligns with the overarching objective of moving to a more sustainable and ecologically responsible future. However, this finding supports (Ding et al., 2021 ) validating the detrimental link between eco-innovation and overall CO2  emissions. Furthermore, the findings revealed that a rise in economic complexity for Model-1 was insignificant. However, ECI must be accountable for increasing CO2  emanations in the short and long run for Model 2. As a result, a 1 % increment in ECI accelerates EFP by 0.52 % in the short term and 0.69 % in the long term. The finding that economic complexity raises the ecological footprint of the United States in both the short and long run shows a long-term link between ecological footprints. Economic complexity frequently entails a broader range of enterprises and sectors, some of which are resource-intensive. higher economic complexity may result in higher use of raw materials and energy, resulting in a bigger environmental impact. The outcomes of this research reveal a positive link between EFP and ECI, which is completely corroborated by (Abbasi et al., 2021a; Rafique et al., 2021 ), whereas (Doğan et al., 2020 ) demonstrated a negative linkage between ECI and CO2  emissions. Another way to verify the long-term link between the study variables is to examine the value of the equation ECTt-1 . The statistically significant and negative value of the ECTt-1  demonstrates strong collaboration (Pata and Isik, 2021 ). The current study's ECT results also indicated a robust coalition, as the value of ECTt-1  is negative and significant. Table 5  summarizes the findings of Models 1 and 2, indicating an adverse and measuredly substantial ECT of 41 % and an equilibrium rate of 44 % over the period. This ECT value is the rate at which short-term volatility progresses to long-term autoregulation, known as the rate of adjustment/change. The R2  results revealed that the control factors account for 55 % of the variance in the controlled variable (Model-1) and 54 % in (Model-2). The F-statistic, p-value reflects the model's fitness. The results will help the United States achieve more ecologically responsible energy alternatives and a safer energy imminent. This might enable them to get closer to reaching net-zero emissions goal.  4.2 DARDL simulations prediction (Model-1) The DARDL chart forecasts the regressor shift and its influence on the controlled variable(s) while keeping explanatory variables constant. We estimate independent variables such as; ET, FFE, GI, and ECI impact CO2  emissions by 10 % increase or decrease by 10 % increase or decrease. The research also focused on the impact of spurious regressor adaption on controlled variables, as seen in Fig. 3   (a – h). Fig. 3 . (a & b) depicts the impact of a 10 % rise or reduction in ET on CO2  emanations in the short run and long run. A 10 % rise in ET predicts a progressive influence on CO2  in the short run and long run, though a 10 % decrease predicts a beneficial effect on the environment in the short run and long run but indicates a downward trend. Based on empirical evidence, it is evident that an extended use of renewable energy technologies (ET) contributes to a higher environmental quality in the United States. In comparison to coal-fired reactors, renewable energy sources generate significantly fewer greenhouse gases (GHGs), ranging from 90 to 99 percent less, and contribute 70–90 percent less pollution. Shifting reliance from fossil fuels, especially coal, to renewable sources presents a viable strategy to mitigate environmental issues such as air pollution and GHG emissions. This transition aligns with the goal of fostering a cleaner and more sustainable energy landscape, ultimately contributing to enhanced environmental quality in the United States. The link between FFE and CO2  is seen in Fig. 3 . (c & d). The graph depicts energy transition and its impact on the environment. A 10 % increase in the FFE increases CO2  emanations in the short and long run, but a 10 % drop in the FFE lowers pollution in the short term. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), fossil fuels create societal health hazards, pollution, and rising temperatures. The following are some of the environmental effects of fossil fuels: Air pollution: The combustion of fossil fuels, especially coal, may emit toxic substances into the atmosphere, such as Sulphur dioxide and monoxide. Due to air contamination, serious illness has been documented in areas downstream of coal power stations. Water pollution: Sulfur from unprocessed coal smoke may be associated with other components to form acid rain, while oil spills contaminate marine territories. Although water pollution is not limited to FFE (even though RE sources such as nuclear may damage water), unrestrained fuel spills contaminate water and jeopardize plants, wildlife, and public health. Excess carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, gasoline-powered automobiles, cement manufacture, and other industrial operations trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, causing a rise in global temperatures. Hence, the outcome discourages using FFE in the US energy mix. In addition, Fig. 3 . (e-f) is a 10 % boost in green innovation/technologies that reduce CO2  secretions in the short and long run. Conversely, a 10 % decrease in GI upsurges CO2  discharges in the short and long way. GI significantly impacts reducing carbon emissions by enhancing energy use efficiency. As can be seen, technological advancements play a pivotal role in lowering carbon emissions. Fig. 3 . (g-h) a 10 % rise in ECI indicates an increase in CO2  emissions in the short and long run. Furthermore, a 10 % drop in ECI represents a reduction in CO2  secretions in the short and long way. It infers that CO2  emissions rise with an escalation in ECI and subsequently fall once the US economy reaches the ECI's long-term pivotal moment. This disparity might be attributed to how economic growth and complexity are measured.  4.3 DARDL simulations prediction (Model-2) Fig. 4  . (a-h) exhibits Panel-2 that predicts ET, FFE, GI, and ECI effects on EFP by 10 % positive and negative shocks in the short and long term. Fig. 4 . (a-b) 10 percent positive shock in ET shows an increasing EFP trend in short-and-long terms. In contrast, a 10 % negative shock inversely influences EFP in the short and long run. Furthermore, a 10 % upsurge in FFE has a favorable influence on EFP in the short and long term, as seen in Fig. 4 . (c and d); conversely, a 10 % decrease in FFE has an inverse link with EFP in the short run. According to the assessed empirical evidence, fossil fuel energy is the major cause of environmental harm. It might be because the US economy relies significantly on conventional energy sources such as oil, coal, and gas. The increased use of energy sources for industrial, agricultural, and commercial reasons indicates a growth in human activity, which causes ecological concerns and motivates people to expand their EFP (Zafar et al., 2019 ). The forecast suggests that massive investments in renewable energy and diminishing reliance on fossil fuels will advantage short-and-long-term. Likewise, Fig. 4 . (e-f) shows that a 10 % increase in GI reduces EFP in the short and long run. Likewise, a 10 % drop in GI greatly influences EFP. The inference drawn is that environmental technology, often associated with green innovation, is environmentally friendly and plays a significant role in enhancing and refining environmental quality in the United States. Green innovations, such as advancements in renewable energy, sustainable practices, and eco-friendly technologies, are seen as positive contributors to mitigating environmental impact. These innovations are instrumental in promoting cleaner processes, reducing pollution, and fostering a more sustainable and environmentally responsible approach to technology and industrial practices, ultimately leading to an improvement in overall environmental quality in the United States. Fig. 4 . (g and h) also reveal that a 10 % increase in ECI positively connects with EFP in short-and-long terms. On the contrary, a 10 % decline in ECI reduces EFP in the short and long run. As a result, the estimations show a short-run and long-run influence of economic complexity on EFP, implying that the complexity of export goods leads to rising environmental degradation in terms of EFP. For instance, as economic complexity increases, the ecological footprint grows global hectares (gha) per human. The empirical results are consistent with the findings of (Neagu and Teodoru, 2019 ) for the case of 25 European nations. Economic complexity refers to a nation’s production and manufacturing structure to gain a viable edge in international markets. While the unique production structure contributes to a certain energy structure, the environment may be influenced by emissions, biodiversity, and ecological footprint (Shahzad et al., 2021 ). According to the ECI projection, restructuring and economic complexity in industrial operations emerge as significant factors contributing to environmental deterioration in the United States. The findings underscore the crucial need to transition from a focus on mere complexity to fostering proficiency and productivity in resource use within the economy. This transition involves the integration of advanced and highly efficient technologies in the production of complex goods. By emphasizing proficiency and sustainable resource utilization, the goal is to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts associated with industrial operations and promote a more sustainable and environmentally responsible economic framework in the United States.  4.4 Diagnostic check As indicated in Table 6  , various diagnostic procedures were employed to verify the appropriate model, and serial correlation and heteroscedasticity do not exist in the model. The H0  has since overruled the JB test, indicating that the predicted residuals are normally distributed, so it may infer that the procedure is typically right for intrinsic reasons. The Ramsey RESET test is utilized to validate the model's accuracy and to confirm if the model is properly established. Finally, we use the cumulative sum approach to investigate probable structural breakdowns for parameter stability. Fig. 5  . shows that the observed test statistic is inside the 95 % confidence interval, indicating that the estimated parameters are stable.  4.5 Spectral Granger causality (Model-1 and 2) Furthermore, the (Breitung and Candelon, 2006 ) test was utilized to investigate the causal link between ET, FFE, GI, and ECI on CO2  and EFP in the United States. The statistical findings from models −1 and −2 presented in Table 7   reveal a long, medium, and short link amid ET, FFE, GI, and ECI on CO2  and EFP employing the frequencies ω i  = 0.05   ω i  = 1.50   , and ω i  = 2.50   , correspondingly, as reported in previous research (Xu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Specifically, according to panel 1, ET, GI, and ECI are the key indications of long-, medium- and short-term CO2  emanations in the US, but FFE is negligible for the medium run and substantial for the long-and-short term. The results are comparable to those reported earlier (Yi et al., 2023 ) showing a positive link amid renewable energy, fossil fuel, and CO2  emissions in the US. Similarly (Ning et al., 2023 ) revealed GI lowers emissions also (Doğan et al., 2020 ) inferred economic complexity and renewable energy influence in alleviating the environmental challenges in OECD states. Model-2 results demonstrate that FFE and ECI have a long-medium and short-term influence on EFP. Furthermore, ET exhibits a long and medium-run relationship with EFP, but GI observed a medium-run effect on EFF. The empirical findings reveal a link between EFP and ECI, which is completely supported by (Korkut Pata, 2021; Rafique et al., 2021 ) concluded that economic complexity and renewable energy could play a role in minimizing environmental depletion issues. A higher ECI rating is based on the economy’s dynamic structure, including proficient technology and resource sharing with increased use of RE. Because of the RE spillover impact, emerging nations may follow an alike trajectory as industrialized nations create more RE. It will reduce environmental impact as aligned with (Neagu and Teodoru, 2019; Swart and Brinkmann, 2019 ).   5 Conclusion and policy recommendations The research explored the link between energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, and economic complexity with CO2  emissions and ecological footprint in the United States from 1980 to 2020. To provide firm evidence, the research chose the distinctive factors previously ignored and may contribute to achieving the net-zero emissions agenda of COP26 for the United States. To provide robust empirical evidence the research applied the novel dynamic ARDL model and FDC technique to examine the variables' short-medium and long-term casual interactions. The outcomes revealed significant relationship among the variables. In light of empirical findings, useful policy ramifications can be suggested for policymakers and regulatory authorities in the US. 5.1 Policy framework In the context of the United States' energy transition, renewable energy stands as a crucial tool for mitigating environmental impact of CO2  emissions. Despite significant efforts to promote renewable energy in the US, its utilization remains inadequate, with fossil fuels still dominating over 80 % of the overall energy mix (Korkut Pata, 2021 ). To address this challenge, consider the following concise policy recommendations: Implement a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to incentivize emission reductions across all energy sources, fostering a more economically-driven push towards renewables. Provide targeted incentives and subsidies to facilitate the development and deployment of cleaner renewable energy technologies, with a specific emphasis on advancing carbon capture and storage systems. Direct investments towards strengthening the integration of renewable energy into the grid and promoting energy storage technologies. This will enhance system reliability and efficiency. Establish and enforce rigorous energy efficiency criteria for renewable energy installations. Regular inspections should be conducted to ensure compliance and minimize emissions from these sources. Implementing these policies will not only accelerate the transition to renewables but also contribute to a more sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure in the United States. To address the escalating environmental damage caused by rising fossil fuel suggest that, accelerate transition to renewable energy advocate and implement policies that expedite the shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. Also, strengthen regulations on vehicle fuel efficiency to curb emissions from the transportation sector, which contributes significantly to overall emissions. Encourage the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles. Invest in the modernization and expansion of the electric grid to accommodate cleaner energy sources, improve energy transmission, and enhance distribution efficiency. Manage natural resources efficiently by maximizing the proportion of renewable energy in the overall energy mix. Expand incentives for low-carbon energy consumption, offering additional tax breaks to businesses utilizing green energy, improving energy efficiency, and reducing energy intensity. Enforce and update emissions standards and regulations for the fossil fuel sector, encompassing power plants and industrial activities. Support the development of public transit systems and infrastructure for walking and cycling to reduce reliance on personal automobiles. Mandate rigorous environmental impact evaluations for shifts from fossil fuels, taking emissions into account in permitting decisions. To leverage and capitalize on the benefits of green innovation for emission reduction in the United States, the following policy recommendations are proposed: establish a reward system for inventors and corporations involved in creating and patenting green technology. Incentives could include longer patent protection or expedited patent applications to encourage sustained green innovation. Actively reform policies to favor green innovation and associated technologies. Invest in projects that promote green strategies and ensure that these initiatives address both environmental and social challenges while fostering long-term prosperity. Develop guidelines that facilitate environmentally responsible innovation and technology. Incorporate a green strategy to create blueprints for accountable innovation, managing risks and uncertainties associated with technological breakthroughs. Set criteria for determining green standards for technology to enhance environmental quality. Foster a competitive platform that enables enterprises to exchange breakthrough technology and benefits, promoting deep synergy. Implement a supportive taxation system to boost the development of environment-related technologies. This can significantly contribute to decreasing carbon emissions, improving environmental quality, and driving fiscal prosperity. Encourage the export of knowledge and skill-intensive products to improve the environment. Provide tax breaks to enterprises exporting advanced goods and incentives to adopt greener energy sources, thereby expanding exports of high-value-added merchandise and refined products while reducing CO2 emissions and environmental footprint.  5.2 Research limitations and future directions Finally, despite the significant findings of our study, several limitations need further investigation in future research. Green innovation, for example, has been observed to take numerous forms, along with the invention of new technologies, the optimization of current technologies, and hybrid methods. Patent data or R&D expenditures alone are insufficient innovation metrics since they do not capture all inventive components of technological development. Future researchers could expand this study by investigating the role of institutional quality, globalization, environmental taxes, and ecological footprint in the context of pollution haven or halo hypothesis, making a significant contribution to the literature and suggesting some concrete policy ramifications.
