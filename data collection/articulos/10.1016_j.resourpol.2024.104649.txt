                  The goal of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has shifted the attention of all countries towards more environmentally sustainable concerns. This study estimates the role of natural resources and green technologies on energy transition and CO2 emission (the key indicators of sustainable development) under the moderating effect of fintech in resource abundant countries. The data spanning over 2000 to 2021 period is collected from the World Development Indicators (WDI) and OECD database and to conduct empirical estimation, the study uses Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS), Dynamic OLS (DOLS) and Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) estimation methods. The findings of FMOLS and DOLS estimations established that there is significant negative effect of green technologies and fintech on CO2 emission and significant and positive effect on energy transition. In contrast, natural resources exert positive effect on both CO2 emission and energy transition in selected countries. Introducing fintech as moderator does not significantly impact natural resources and CO2 emission and energy transition nexus, but it significantly and positively moderates the relationship of green technologies with CO2 emission and energy transition. MMQR estimation also establishes the similar results with significance varying at different quantile levels. The study recommends the concerned governments to facilitate more investment in research and development in green technologies and fintech industries to promote creative innovations.

This study estimates the role of natural resources and green technologies on energy transition and CO2  emission (the key indicators of sustainable development) under the moderating effect of fintech in resource abundant countries. The data spanning over 2000 to 2021 period is collected from the World Development Indicators (WDI) and OECD database and to conduct empirical estimation, the study uses Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS), Dynamic OLS (DOLS) and Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) estimation methods. The findings of FMOLS and DOLS estimations established that there is significant negative effect of green technologies and fintech on CO2  emission and significant and positive effect on energy transition. In contrast, natural resources exert positive effect on both CO2  emission and energy transition in selected countries. Introducing fintech as moderator does not significantly impact natural resources and CO2  emission and energy transition nexus, but it significantly and positively moderates the relationship of green technologies with CO2  emission and energy transition. MMQR estimation also establishes the similar results with significance varying at different quantile levels. The study recommends the concerned governments to facilitate more investment in research and development in green technologies and fintech industries to promote creative innovations.   Keywords Fintech  Green technologies  Natural resources  FMOLS & DOLS  MMQR    1 Introduction All world economies are facing the challenges of drastic and long lasting climate change and global warming (Udeagha and Ngepah, 2023a ). Rapidly increasing level of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions is the main cause of these climatic issues and one of the main causes of this rapid increase in GHG emission level is different anthropogenic activities aimed at achieving high economic growth level (G. Aziz et al., 2022 ). These activities are the responsible for rising emissions of energy-based CO2  because almost all of the economic activities are based on fossil fuel generated energy (S. K. Khan et al., 2023 ). This source of energy contributes to environmental damage and causes billion-dollar economic losses (Xu et al., 2023b ). In the presence of these distortions in environment and economies, achieving sustainable development has become the need of the hour and a real challenge for all world economies. Sustainable development refers to “the development that fulfills the needs of current generation without affecting or compromising future generation's ability to fulfill their needs” (Hanif et al., 2022a ). In this regard, the 2015 agenda of United Nations (UN) has set 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) related to improved education and health, reduced level of poverty and provision of well-being and prosperity through sustainability (Goran et al., 2021 ). Among these SDGs, SDG 7 (clean and affordable energy) and SDG 13 (climatic actions) particularly are concerned about remedial actions for CO2  emission (CE) because of its serious repercussions for environment and human life. SDG-7 emphasizes “energy transition (ET)” to mitigate the crises arising from climate change and global warming mainly caused by CE. Since 2015, UN has also been focusing on mitigating global warming and climatic variations by effectively integrating the ET concept (Bashir et al., 2023b ). ET reflects the fossil fuels reduction, energy efficiency improvement and renewable energy utilization. Broadly speaking, the process of ET refers to “a shift of the entire energy system instead of change in single source of energy”, like the complete transition of entire economic systems heavily dependent on traditional sources of energy (coal, petroleum or oil etc.) to clean, new and less carbon producing energy (clean or renewable energy) (Shahbaz et al., 2022 ; Guo et al., 2023 ). It has also become essential to advance the ET in light of the limited supply of energy sources and the risky environmental conditions to achieve the targets of sustainable development (Xu et al., 2023b ). Among several other factors documented in the literature (Güney, 2019 ; X. Li et al., 2021 ; Nchofoung and Asongu, 2022 ; Zakari et al., 2022 ), the research and development in technology also has a significant role in SDGs achievement by increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of more and new sustainable methods (Chien et al., 2021b ). The adoption of green technology (GT) and financial technologies (FT) is one of the key aspects in achieving the SDGs 7 and 13, as they may significantly contribute to ET and climate change mitigation and adaptation (Hu et al., 2022 ). GT include a number of mitigation technologies including combustion technologies, electricity transmission, distribution or generation technologies, technologies related to renewable energy production, and several other technologies related to climate mitigation (Gao et al., 2023 ). All of technologies are key contributors to achieve SDG targets of climatic actions and clean energy. These technologies are helpful in the process of ET as they aid in the internalization of the adverse ecological externalities generated through the energy consumption and generation processes (S. Ullah et al., 2023 ; Hashmi et al., 2023 ). More specifically, eco-innovations have the capability to facilitate environmental restoration and conservation by the integrating ecological and engineering principles (Hanif et al., 2022c ). Likewise, emerging technologies in financial sectors commonly known as financial technologies (FT) have received recognition for their numerous potential effects on climate change in addition to their potential to decentralize financial services and increase financial access (Y. Lu et al., 2023 ). Such as FT plays a prominent role in facilitating green finance facilities like loans for renewable energy, green bonds and carbon trading etc all of which have favourable impact on environmental quality. FT solutions can assist people and businesses in reducing waste and pollution while optimizing their energy consumption (Chien et al., 2021 ). FT has positive role in enhancing energy efficiency which supports ET and environmental sustainability (Song et al., 2023 ; Yan et al., 2023 ; Das et al., 2023 ). Moreover, according to Butu et al. (2021) , internet based financial institutions and organizations provide sustainable financing facilities for energy transition processes. Since, financial sector plays an important part in an economy, technology based growth of financial sector aids in achieving sustainable development (A. Ullah et al., 2023 ). In contrast to environmental sustainable technologies, natural resource (NR) extraction is one of the major factors associated with rising energy consumption and degradation of environmental quality (Hanif et al., 2022c ). NR extraction is associated with 82 percent of global energy consumption and 51 percent of global CE. NR depletion is also blame worthy for 91 percent biodiversity loss (M. Ahmad et al., 2020 ). Continuous NR exhaustion has become a major problem, as over the last 30 years NR exploitation increased threefold, biomass consumption to 25 billion from 10 billion tons, oil, gas and coal extractions increased from 7 to 16 tons. The massive upsurge in NR exploitation regarding extraction, deforestation, agriculture prompted serious environmental sustainability problems (Awosusi et al., 2022 ). On the other hand, a country bestowed with a variety of NR has lower dependence on unclean energy resources imports and lower consumption of un clean resources lead to lower CE level (Sadiq et al., 2024 ). NR is also at the core of ET. The efficient NR utilization like hydro, wind, biomass and solar are significant in securing transition of energy sector towards sustainable and clean energy (Jhariya et al., 2022 ; Nawaz et al., 2019 ). NR provide an energy source that is clean, abundant, and renewable, reducing our dependency on fossil fuels and assisting in the fight against global warming (Abbasi et al., 2021 ). Additionally, NR serve as the primary supply of raw materials for the manufacture of renewable energy technology such as turbines for wind power, solar panels and batteries (S. Ullah et al., 2023 ). Considering this background, the objective of current study is to empirically estimate the association of FT, NR and GT with ET and CE in 14 resource abundant economies namely China, Canada, Brazil, Russia, Australia, Mexico, Peru, Saudi-Arabia, Iran, Indonesia, South Africa, UAE and the USA from 2000 to 2021 period. This study objective holds its significance from policy perspective as the climate change and global warming is currently crucial issue that the world is encountering, and therefore has become the agenda for various environmental conferences such as Paris agreement (2015), Climate change conference (COP26) aimed at limiting the global temperature below 1.5 °C of pre-industrial era (Dwivedi et al., 2022 ). Anthropogenic activities mainly dependent on energy use is the main cause and contributor to CO2  emission and to deal with these issues, shifting the energy sector towards more renewable sources or energy transition is the need of the hour. Several countries are currently considering the shift to clean energy as their primary development strategy (Shahbaz et al., 2022 ). This is especially true of the most developing countries especially those included in our panel, who are already shifting to renewable energy as their primary energy source for consumption and production but at a very slow rate (ElSayed et al., 2023 ; Fattouh et al., 2019 ). These selected economies have plenty of NR which are the main source of growth in these economies. But these countries are also among the major energy consuming and CO2  emitting countries and have leading positions in deteriorating the environmental quality (Fig. 1  ). Like China is the top emitting country with 28% of CE, followed by the USA (15%), Russia (5%), Canada (3%), Australia, Iran, Indonesia, Brazil, Saudi-Arabia and South Africa (2%) and Mexico, Peru (1%). Moreover, these countries are also among the top energy consuming countries, and despite having considerable potential for renewable sources, these countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuel based energy sources (Jun et al., 2022 ). Also, one of the main causes of these serious environmental repercussions in these countries is the constant NR depletion. Thus to mitigate these environmental concerns, these countries are instantaneously required to shift their energy system from non renewable to renewable based system to achieve sustainable development targets. Considering these energy and environment related issues, the study intends to examine the role of FT, GT and NR on ET and CE in top resource abundant countries. The findings of the study provide powerful policy insights for the policy makers to promote ET and reduce CE not in these as well as other countries. Particularly, the study seeks to answer the following research questions:1. What is the effect of FT, GT and NR on CE?  2. What is the effect of FT, NR, GT on ET?  3. Does FT moderate the relationship of GT with CE and ET?  4. Does FT moderate the relationship of NR with CE and ET?    The study holds its novelty and provides significant contribution to the literature in following ways: First, the study extends the traditional STIRPAT model of environment by incorporating NR, GT and FT as potential contributors of sustainable development. Second, the study estimates the role of NR, FT and GT in ET and CE in above mentioned resource abundant countries. Previously, different studies have explored the role of these factors in the context of different countries (N. Ali et al., 2022 ; Caglar et al., 2022 ; Coffie et al., 2022 ; H. Li et al., 2023 ; Ramzan et al., 2023 ; A. Ullah et al., 2023 ). To the best of the author's knowledge, no previous study has ever analyzed the role of these factors in the subject matter in the context of the resource abundant countries. Third and most significant contribution of the present study to the literature is in terms of investigating the moderating effect of FT on GT and ET and CE nexus and NR and CE and ET nexus which earlier studies did not take into consideration and makes this study marked distinguishable from earlier researches. Fourth, the study also holds a novel methodological contribution by using FMOLS, and DOLS and novel introduced MMQR estimation approach proposed by (Machado and Silva, 2019 ) as robustness check which has the potential to estimate the quantile varying relationship between dependent and independent variables simultaneously dealing with the issues of endogeneity and heterogeneity. According to the author's knowledge, only a few studies exist previously which have used MMQR estimation to study the subject matter (Adebayo et al., 2022 ; Afshan et al., 2022 ; Guo et al., 2023 ). The remaining sections of the study are organized in the manner that following this section, next section 2  provides a comprehensive review of previous relevant studies. Section 3  encompasses data, variables and selected methodologies. Section 4  reports results and interpretations. Conclusion and policy recommendations are provided in section 5 .  2 Literature review This section reviews the existing studies about role of GT, FT, NR in environmental degradation and ET. The literature review section is divided into three strands: First strand of studies include GT, ET and environmental degradation. Second strand covers studies about NR, ET and environmental degradation, and last third section reviews studies about FT, ET and environmental degradation. 2.1 Green technology, environmental degradation and energy transition GT have always been considered as a key to sustainable development. The ecological modernization theory contends that advancing green innovations and technology can increase resource efficiency and mitigate human-caused environmental damage (Ramzan et al., 2023 ). Almost all of the scholars have concluded that GT improve environmental quality and promote sustainable development. Among them, Ramzan et al. (2023)  analyzed the role of GT in environmental sustainability and ET in the UK over the period from 1995 to 2019 using Bootstrapping Rolling Window technique. According to the study findings, GT have negative impact on ecological footprints and positive impact on ET. Taking the data of E−7 countries, Yu et al. (2022)  estimated the role of GT in environmental degradation measured by CE from 1990 to 2019 period. Dynamic Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (DCCEMG) approach was taken to study the nexus between two variables by the researchers. The findings revealed that there was negative impact of GT on CE in selected countries. In case of China, H. Chen et al. (2023)  collected provincial level data for 2007 to 2019 period and explored the role of GT on CE using Spatial Distribution Model. The findings revealed that inverted U-shaped relationship between GT and CE. In another study for China, (Hordofa et al., 2023 ) analyzed the effect of GT on CE over 1990 to 2019 period. Using ARDL approach, the study observed a negative impact of GT on CE. Taking a panel data of Asian economies, Chien et al. (2023)  estimated the role of GT on CE and they also found the negative impact of GT on CE in CS-ARDL results. In the context of OECD, (Liao et al., 2023 ) analyzed the impact of GT on ecological footprints using MMQR estimation approach. According to the findings, there was negative impact of GT on ecological footprints. Chishti et al. (2023)  examined the role of GT in ET over 2016 to 2022 period. According to their findings, GT promoted ET. In continuation, Obobisa et al. (2023)  studied the impact of GT on sustainable development measured by CE by considering the data of three African countries from 1990 to 2016 period. Major findings from Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimation indicated that GT mitigated CE in African countries. For OECD countries, Hu et al. (2022)  estimated the relationship between GT and ET over 2000 to 2019 period. Using System- GMM estimation approach, the findings indicated positive impact of GT on ET. Moreover, environmental governance was found to positively moderate the nexus between GT and ET. In case of Pakistan, Hanif et al.,(2022c)  applied VAR estimation approach to estimate the role of NR and GT on CE. The positive impact of NR and negative impact of GT was found on CE. Han et al., 2023b  also analyzed the impact of GT on ET in G-7 countries from 1992 to 2020. CUP-FM and CUP-BC estimations revealed that there was positive impact of GT on ET.  2.2 Natural resources, environmental degradation and energy transition NR are one of the key elements for sustainable development (Arslan et al., 2022 ; Danish and Hassan, 2023 ; Kumar, 2016 ; Ulucak and Ozcan, 2020 ). Not only developing but developed economies also rely on them for economic growth (Erum and Hussain, 2019 ; Gerelmaa and Kotani, 2016 ; S. A. R. Khan et al., 2022 ). However, the use of these resources may result in environmental deterioration and resource depletion. Unsustainable NR use in both developed and developing economies cause serious issues such as water scarcity, deforestation, waste generation and climate change (S. Ullah, R. Li et al., 2023 ). Empirically, a large number of empirical studies are available analyzing the role of NR in environmental sustainability and energy transition but the matter still remains inconclusive. S. Ullah, R. Luo and Mabrouk (2022)  examined the role of NR on ET in the USA using the quarterly data over 1990 to 2020 period. Fourier Quantile Causality approach was applied in the study which indicated that NR increased the ET in the country. Likewise, Luo and Mabrouk (2022)  considered the data for top ten resource rich countries to analyze the nexus between NR and environmental degradation measured through ecological footprints over 1990 to 2018 period using CS-ARDL model. According to study findings, there was negative effect of NR on ecological footprints in selected countries. Taking into consideration the data of BRICS countries, Adebayo et al. (2023)  estimated the effect of NR on CE from 1990 to 2019 period. The findings of CS-ARDL estimation revealed that NR decreased CE. (S.-Z. Huang, 2022 ) estimated the role of NR on ET in China over 1971 to 2019 period. The results of ARDL model indicated that NR promoted ET in China. S. Zhang et al. (2023)  explored the effect of NR on ET in the USA over 1985 to 2021 period. FMOLS, DOLS and Canonical Cointegration regression revealed positive effect of NR on ET. In another study for the USA, S. Ullah, R. Luo and Mabrouk (2022)  studied the role of NR in ET for the period 1990 to 2020. Using Fourier Quantile Causality, NR were found to enhance ET. (Bashir et al., 2023a ) studied the impact of NR on CE in ten newly industrialized countries. Using AMG, CCEMG and MMQR approaches, the study found that NR promoted CE in concerned countries. Considering the data of Asian countries, Zafar et al. (2021)  scrutinized the nexus between NR and CE over 1990 to 2018 period. The findings of second generation panel estimations indicated that NR increased CE. For MINT countries, N. Aziz et al. (2021)  estimated the relationship between NR and CE over 1995 to 2018 time period. Using MMQR regression approach, the study found positive role of NR in CE at lower quantiles and its impact became insignificant at middle to higher quantiles. M. I. Shah et al. (2023)  estimated the role of NR in CE over 1990–2019 period using AMG and CCEMG panel approaches and concluded that NR reduced CE in ASEAN countries. In case of 4 South Asian countries, Mehmood (2022)  also estimated the NR and CE nexus over 1990 to 2019 period. Using ARDL Bound testing approach, negative impact of NR on CE was found in India and Pakistan, whereas the impact of NR was positive in Bangladesh and insignificant in Sri-Lanka on CE.  2.3 Fintech, environmental degradation and energy transition In existing literature, the link between financial development and ET and environmental sustainability has widely studied by the researchers (M. Khan and Ozturk, 2021 ; Khezri et al., 2021 ; Nawaz et al., 2020 ; Nawaz et al., 2021a ), however the estimation of the relationship between FT and above mentioned factors is still in its infancy and there hasn't been much research done on this topic (S. Muhammad et al., 2022 ). Udeagha and Ngepah (2023b)  studied the role of FT in CE in BRICS countries from 2000 to 2018 period. Using CS-ARDL estimation approach, negative impact of FT was observed on CE in the study. Tao et al. (2022)  considered the global data to analyze the role of FT on GHG emissions using GMM and 2SLS estimations and findings revealed that there was negative effect of FT on GHG emissions. For Xu et al., 2023a  explored the role of FT on CE in China using provincial data over 2011 to 2020 period. Using GMM estimation approach, the findings indicated negative impact of FT on CE. In another study for China, X. Cheng et al. (2023)  estimated the role of FT in CE in 253 cities from 2011 to 2019 period. It was found that FT significantly reduced CE in Fixed Effects model and DID models. For 7- Sub Saharan African Countries, Coffie et al. (2022)  estimated the role of FT on CE over 2009 to 2020 period. According to the findings of FMOLS estimation, there was significantly negative impact of FT on CE. Most recently, Sadiq et al. (2024)  analyzed the role of FT on CE under the mediating effects of NR volatility and in China for 2013 to 2022 period. The findings of GMM analysis revealed that FT reduced CE in the selected countries. The mediating effect of green finance and NR volatility on CE were positive and negative respectively. (K. Khan et al., 2023 ) explored the effect of digital financial inclusion on CE in developing and emerging countries. The study used System-GMM estimation and found the positive impact of digital financial inclusion on CE in concerned countries. In case of BRICS economies, (Wei et al., 2024 ) analyzed the effect of FT on CE. Using MMQR analysis, the study found that FT reduced CE. Empirically, the number of studies estimating the role of FT in ET is dearth as compare to those estimating the role of financial development on ET. To our knowledge, Xu et al. (2023b)  estimated the impact of FT on ET in global panel of 91 middle income countries over 2000 to 2020 period. Dricsoll-Kraay Standard Error approach was applied in the study which indicated the positive impact of FT on ET. Croutzet and Dabbous (2021)  scrutinized the data of 21 OECD countries from 2005 to 2018 period and applied Driscoll-Kraay Standard Error for estimating the role of FT in renewable energy use. The findings of the study revealed positive contribution of FT on renewable energy use.  2.4 Research gaps The extensive review of the available literature on subject matter reveal some significant research gaps that the present study aims to fill (Coffie et al., 2022 ; Croutzet and Dabbous, 2021 ; Sun and Wang, 2021 ; Tao et al., 2022 ; Udeagha and Muchapondwa, 2023 ). First, despite the heavy dependence of resource abundant countries on NR for economic growth, little research has been done in these countries to assess the role of NR in environmental sustainability or sustainable development (Usman et al., 2022 ). Second, in addition to NR, the study also estimates the impact of GT and FT on ET and CE. This combination of variables, to the author's knowledge has never been studied in the context of resources abundant countries before (Abdulqadir, 2022 ; Szetela et al., 2022 ; Usman et al., 2022 ). Third, the study also estimates the moderating impact of FT on NR and CE and ET nexus and GT and ET and CE nexus. The researchers are unable to find any study that has estimated the moderating effect of FT on above mentioned subject matters. These research gaps makes knowledge on the sustainable development in these economies limited and restricted. These shortcomings make the present research the first to provide comprehensive empirical research in order to comprehend the road map for achieving sustainable development in resource-rich countries.   3 Research methodology 3.1 Model specification The basic objective of the current study is to estimate the effect of NR, GT under the moderating effect of FT on sustainable development in 14 resource abundant countries over 2000 to 2021 period. The study formulates two separate models to fulfill the study objectives. The conventional IPAT model developed by Ehrlich and Holdren (1971) is used in the study to specify these models. The IPAT model represents that environmental impact is a factor of three variables: Affluence (A), technology (T) and population (P). Eq. (1)  represents IPAT identity as:(1) I = P × A × T      However, we cannot use IPAT model for hypothesis testing as it is a representation of accounting identity. So a stochastic and modified version of IPAT model named “Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT)” developed by Dietz and Rosa (1997). We represent the STIRPAT model as:(2) I i  = α P i β  A i γ  T i δ  ε i      where, I denotes environmental impact, P, A and T represent population, affluence and technology respectively, α is constant term and β, δ and γ represent parameters. ε and i denote error term and cross-sections. Applying logarithm, Eq. (2)  can be written in linear form as follows:(3)  l o g I  i  = α + β  log  P i  + γ  log  A i  + δ  log  T i  + ε i       Following Eq. (3) , we formulate the Models of the study as:(4) C O  2 i t   = β 0  + β 1  G D P  t  + β 2  G D P  i t  2  + β 3  P G  i t   + β 4  F T  i t   + β 5  G I  i t   + ε i t       (5) E T  i t   = β 0  + β 1  G D P  i t   + β 2  P G  i t   + β 4  F T  i t   + β 5  G I  i t   + ε i t        In Eqs. (4) and (5) , CO2 and ET represent I, GDP represents A, FT and GI represent T and PG represents P factors of STIRPAT model. Following S. Ullah, R. Luo and Mabrouk (2022) , Adebayo et al. (2023) , Luo and Mabrouk (2022) , we extend Eqs. (4) and (5)  by incorporating natural resources as:(6) C O  2 i t   = β 0  + β 1  G D P  i t   + β 2  G D P  i t  2  + β 3  P G  i t   + β 4  F T  i t   + β 5  G I  i t   + β 6  N R  i t   + ε i t       (7) E T  i t   = β 0  + β 1  G D P  i t   + β 2  P G  i t   + β 3  F T  i t   + β 4  G I  i t   + β 5  N R  i t   + ε i t        Introducing FT as moderator into the Models, Eq. (6)  and Eq. (7)  are reformulated as follows:(8) C O  2 i t   = β 0  + β 1  G D P  i t   + β 2  G D P  i t  2  + β 3  P G  i t   + β 4  F T  i t   + β 5  G I  i t   + β 6  N R  i t   + β 7  F T * N R  i t   + β 6  F T * G T  i t   + ε i t       (9) E T  i t   = β 0  + β 1  G D P  i t   + β 2  P G  i t   + β 3  F T  i t   + β 4  G I  i t   + β 5  N R  i t   + β 6  F T * N R  i t   + β 7  F T * G T  i t   + ε i t       where CO2  denotes carbon dioxide emissions, GDP represents economic growth, FT and GI denote financial technologies and green innovations respectively and NR shows natural resources.  3.2 Data and variables All of the variables (dependent and independent both) are elaborated as follows: 3.2.1 CO2 emission (CO2) The first dependent variable of the study is CO2  emission. The total CO2 emission is measured in metric tons per capita. CO2 emission is commonly taken as a measure of environmental quality/degradation as practiced by (C. Chen et al., 2022 ; Haldar and Sharma, 2022 ), (Q. Wang et al., 2023 ; Nawaz et al., 2021b ) and (B. Li and Haneklaus, 2022 ). CO2  emission refers to those produced during cement manufacturing and fossil fuel burning. They include CO2 produced by consuming gas, solid and liquid flaring and can be used as a basic variable to evaluate the relationship between degradation of the environment and its basic determinants.  3.2.2 Energy Transition The second dependent variable of the study is energy transition (ET). It is believed that switching to renewable energy will help to limit the rise in world average temperatures to 1.5 °C (Shahbaz et al., 2022 ). ET is measured by the ratio of renewable energy to total energy consumption. This variable measures “the renewable energy share in total energy consumption according to the World Bank. Renewable energy is a good representative of clean energy and its share in total energy consumption indicates the progress towards ET. The similar measure is adopted by (Shahbaz et al., 2022 ) and (Xu et al., 2023b ).  3.2.3 Green technologies The study uses green technology innovations measured as environmental related technologies (% of all technologies) as a possible determinant of CE and ET. GT refers to creating and implementing innovative methods and technologies to lessen negative effects on the environment and preserve NR. This can involve the creation of environmentally friendly transport systems, energy-efficient products and services, and clean energy technology (Afshan and Yaqoob, 2023 ). Studies such as (Afshan & Yaqoob, 2022 , 2023 ), (Y. Zhang et al., 2022 ) and (Y. Huang et al., 2022 ) also selected GT as potential determinant of CE and ET. The study hypothesized positive contribution of GT in CE reduction and ET as evidenced by (Y. Huang et al., 2022 ) and (Jun et al., 2022 ).  3.2.4 Natural resources Natural resources (NR) are added as independent variable in both models. It is measured as total natural resource rents (% of GDP). The study selects NR to add in the models because most of the developing countries strongly pursue growth over environmental sustainability which leads to the over exploitation of NR and high pollution in the countries. Previous studies such as (Z. Wang and Razzaq, 2022 ; Baloch et al., 2019 ; Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2018 ), (S.-Z. Huang, 2022 ) and (B. Muhammad and Khan, 2021 ) have also studied NR as potential determinant of CE and ET.  3.2.5 Fintech Fintech is taken as a main independent variable and moderator in the models. The role of FT on CE and ET is determined by forming an index comprising of Mobile cellular subscription (per 100 people), Fixed Broad Band subscription (per 100 people) and Individuals using Internet (% of population) using Principle Component Analysis. The impact of FT on CE and ET was previously determined by (H. Li et al., 2023 ), (Xu et al., 2023b ; Tao et al., 2022 ) and (Y. Lu et al., 2023 ). The present study formulates a hypothesis that FT promote ET and reduce CE in resource abundant countries following the recent studies (Xu et al., 2023b ; Sadiq et al., 2024 ).  3.2.6 Economic growth Economic growth in added as control variable in both models. Gross Domestic Product (constant US$) is used to measure economic growth in the study. This variable is taken into consideration because the quality of the environment mainly depends on the economic growth level, The growth resulting from the economic activities is likely to raise the pollution level (Aller et al., 2021 ). The square of economic growth is also added in Model 1 to test the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis claiming the inverted U-shaped relationship among the variables in the study. Previous literature guides us to add both economic growth and its square as the potential determinant of CE (Altıntaş and Kassouri, 2020 ; Apergis, 2016 ; Bibi and Jamil, 2021 ; Hanif et al., 2022b ).  3.2.7 Population growth The population growth is added as the control variable in the study. Urban population growth (annual %) is used to measure population growth in the current study. One possible hypothesis regarding the population growth is that it can increase the level of CE and ET both. The enormous population and quick rise in economic wealth that have accompanied the expansion of urbanization in many areas have become significant contributors to the rise in energy consumption and are at the centre of the energy transition challenge (Shahbaz et al., 2022 ). Studies including Mohsin et al. (2021) , A. A. Shah et al. (2021) , Shahbaz et al. (2022)  and (Sulaiman and Abdul-Rahim, 2018 ) have included population growth in their studies regarding environmental degradation and ET. Table 1   provides the data sources of all the variables.   3.3 Estimation techniques To achieve the robust parameter estimations, initially two longitudinal panel estimation techniques namely DOLS and FM-OLS are employed. A point to be noted here is that these estimations are used to assess linear correlation among variables by considering mean of variables and these approaches ignore the conditional distribution of data. Therefore, novel introduced MMQR approach proposed by (Machado and Silva, 2019 ) is also applied in the study. Since there are differences in mean or cointegration equilibrium in cross sectional units of the panel, FMOLS estimation proposed by (Pedroni, 2004 ) is used which is comprising of each cross section intercept. It has the capability of maintaining “heterogeneous error –term correlation” in panel data. Moreover, DOLS estimation that (Kao and Chiang, 2001 ) proposed, is considered to be more better estimation approach technique as compare to FMOLS as it is based on Carlo simulations. Additionally, D-OLS can successfully handle endogeneity by expanding differentials between lag and lead data. Traditional quantile estimation approaches do not deal with outliers as these approaches do not have ability to estimate the unobserved heterogeneity among all panel data cross sections. The MMQR permits specific individual effects by allowing the “conditional heterogeneity of variable effects” to generate and influence results. Furthermore, MMQR has the ability to provide efficient and consistent estimations in the case of multicollinearity and endogeneity. Fortunately, this approach also provides unbiased explanation of the non linear relationship among study variables. MMQR also enables the nonlinearities and asymmetries of energy transition and CO2  emission under moment constraints. The MMQR simultaneously handles heterogeneity and endogeneity problems of panel data. In MMQR, the dependent variable's conditional quantile  Q  y   ( δ !  Ẍ ΄ it   ) for different quantiles (location dependent) is given as;(10)  Y  ˙  i t   = α ˙  i  + X i t   ∅ + ( ƛ i  + Z ′  i t   ψ )  U ¨  i t        Eq. (10) , probability is indicated by (ƛi + Ƶ΄it ψ    > 0) and is equal to 1 and (ἀ, ∅ a n d  ψ   ) ΄are estimated parameters. (ἀi, and ƛi), 1 …. n, denotes the specific fixed effects, Ƶ denotes k vector about Ẍ specified modules. The following are obvious changes/variations using j:(11)  Z  j  = Z j  ( X ¨  )  = 1 , … . . , k      Beyond cross sections (i) and time (t), Ẍ΄it  and Ṻit  are scattered identically. Ṻit  represents standardized orthogonal moment conditions Ẍ΄it . Alternatively, Eq. (8)  can be written as follows:(12)  Q  y   ( δ !  Ẍ ΄ it  )  = X ¨  i t    φ + Z ′  i t    Ψ  q ( δ )  + ( α ˙  i  + λ i  q ( δ )        The explanatory variables vectors are denoted by X'it. The Q Y  (τ | X it  ) shows quantile distribution of the Y it   having the condition about the explanatory variable location. The scalar coefficient X'it Xit'.-α i   (τ ) ≡ Տi  p  (τ )+ α i   denotes the fixed effects of τ quantile for individuals. Individual effect, in contrast to conventional OLS fixed effects, have no intercept shifts. The parameters do not vary with time and heterogonous influences are allowed to fluctuate along the restricted probability distribution of dependent variable quantiles. q(τ) represents τth quantile that is computed by answering the optimization problem that results(13) Min q  = ∑ i  ∑ t η δ  ( R i t   − ( λ i  + Z i t  ′  γ )  q  )         4 Results and interpretations First of all, descriptive statistics of study variables is provided in Table 2  . Descriptive statistics show mean, standard deviation and data range (minimum and maximum) of all variables. Moreover, Jarque-Bera test results are also provided in Table 2  showing that not all of the variables are normally distributed. Normal distribution of data is the assumption of all linear models. As data of study variables is not showing the normal distribution, therefore it leads to the appropriateness of MMQR estimation in the present study. One of the most important pre-estimation tests is the CSD test to check the presence or absence of CSD among variables. For this, Pesaran (2004)  test is applied which clearly indicates the rejection of the null hypothesis of no CSD among variables as the test values are statistically highly significant. The results are given in Table 3   below. The presence of CSD among variables necessitates the application of second generation CIPS and CADF unit root tests as these tests takes into account the possible heterogeneity and CSD which is neglected by traditional first generation unit root tests. Table 4   presents the findings of CIPS and CADF tests which indicate that study variables have unit root problem at level but they become stationary after differencing. As the variables are unit root at level and stationary at first difference, second generation Panel cointegration test proposed by Westerlund (2007)  is applied to estimate the long run cointegration relationship among study variables. Corresponding results are given in Table 5   below. The results indicate that alternative hypothesis stating the presence of cointegration is accepted at 1 percent significance level. After performing all necessary pre-estimation tests, now we proceed towards estimation of long run coefficient estimations using FMOLS, DOLS and MMQR methods of analysis. First, Table 6   and Table 7   illustrate the findings of above mentioned approaches for regression models. First of all, the findings reveal the negative impact of FT on CE in Model 1, supporting that FT enhances environmental quality in resource abundant countries. The possible justification for this finding is that FT enhances energy efficiency by optimizing the use of energy, facilitating the provision of green finance and green investment facilities and renewable energy use. FT streamlines the process of loan acquiring especially for green investment projects which can play the significant role in the development of environmentally sustainable projects. On the whole, FT changes the financial system, makes it more prepared for green growth, and can help resource-rich countries build a basis for green development (Y. Lu et al., 2023 ; Wei et al., 2024 ). The finding is supported by the studies of Coffie et al. (2022)  for top seven mobile using countries, Nenavath (2022)  for India, Udeagha and Muchapondwa (2023)  for BRICS and Tao et al. (2022)  for global panel as these studies have argued that FT plays major role in promoting environmental sustainability. However, the findings of (Malone and O’Dwyer, 2014 ; Hileman and Rauchs, 2017 ) for China are in sharp contrast to our estimation by arguing that FT such as bitcoin and crypto currencies require more energy and thereby cause more environmental pollution. As per Model 2, significant and positive impact of FT on ET is found in FMOLS and DOLS estimations implying that FT promotes ET. This positive impact of FT on ET is justifiable because FT encourages the development of the green technologies and energy saving technologies (Xu et al., 2023b ). The ET is being impacted by FT in significant ways because technological progress in financial sector brings technique effect which is responsible for transforming the fossil fuel based activities towards sustainable and renewable energy based activities which results in renewable ET (S. Xu et al., 2023 ). Stated differently, FT and ET are closely related as FT promotes innovation in financial sector and supports the smart energy adoption in energy system. Moreover, FT also enhances transparency, security and efficiency in ET which effectively reduces information asymmetries and costs (Zeng et al., 2024 ). Previously, the studies of H. Li et al. (2023)  for China, Xu et al. (2023b)  for 91 middle income economies, A. S. Ullah et al. (2023)  for BRI countries and Song et al. (2023)  for China support our findings by arguing that novel technologies in financial sector contribute to ET. The results of the study revealed that NR is significantly and positively related with CE and ET in FMOLS and DOLS estimations. This result is not unexpected, and it adds to previous research on the subject as Hassan et al. (2019)  in case of Pakistan, Kongbuamai et al., 2020  and Nathaniel (2021)  for ASEAN, Zafar et al. (2019)  for the USA, and (Ahmed et al., 2020 ) for Pakistan argued that more pressure on NR to obtain higher level of growth pose a serious threat to the environment (Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2018 ). A possible reason for this finding is that increasing reliance on resources to attain rapid economic growth can pose long-term harm to environmental quality. It may be due to the fact that NR promotes environmental damage because exploration operations are not safe. As a result, resources will be unable to renew, leading to a decline in bio capacity and consequently a rise in environmental degradation. Moreover, the “demand for energy, food, water and infrastructure exerts more pressure on NR, promotes emissions and deplete the environmental quality (Isiksal et al., 2022 ). However, the study does no match with the earlier studies of Balsalobre-Lorente et al. (2018)  for EU- 5 countries, Baloch et al. (2019)  for BRICS countries and B. Muhammad and Khan (2021)  for developed and developing countries as they conclude that NR improve environmental quality. But on the other hand, there is positive role of NR on ET also indicating that NR promote ET. The finding strongly supports the studies of Gyamfi et al. (2022)  for G-7 and (Bekun et al., 2019 ) for EU-16 countries, who also concluded positive association of NR with CE and ET. The possible reason for this finding is that NR rents are actually the savings in terms of extraction or utilization of NR and in case of higher NR rents, experts or companies in NR production mostly prefer to adopt more efficient processes for NR production like coal, oil, forests or natural gas. Moreover, these NR rent profits and savings not only promote businesses to extract NR such as coal, oil, natural gas, forests in considerably higher amounts, but also enable the individuals and enterprises to switch to more sustainable pattern of the development to satisfy their energy needs (S.-Z. Huang, 2022 ). As a result, more renewable resources can be used for both domestic and commercial purposes. This facilitates the transition of non renewable energy sources to renewable energy sources which also promotes environmental sustainability (Gyamfi et al., 2022 ). However the finding is not supported by the findings of S. Zhang et al. (2023)  as they found that coal and forest resources do not influence ET positively. Likewise in above regressions, the effect of GT on CE is negative and significant in FMOLS, DOLS. It supports the claim that GT reduce pollution through the use of ecologically friendly and effective technology which in turn improves environmental quality. A possible reason for this finding is that GT have the capability to change the production structure such that it uses renewable energy sources instead of non-renewable ones, hence reducing CE (Hao et al., 2021 ). GT also has the capability to help governments in achieving carbon neutrality targets (Jian and Afshan, 2023 ). These findings are consistent with a number of previous studies including, Chien et al. (2021)  in case of top Asian countries, C. Cheng et al. (2021)  in case of OECD countries, Ganda (2019)  for economic cooperation and development countries, (Vu et al., 2023 ) for MENA region and (Mongo et al., 2021 ) for Europe. However, the findings are not supported by the earlier estimations provided by (Du et al., 2019 ) in case of 71 economies. They argued that GT does not influence GT significantly. Razzaq et al. (2021)  also argued that GT reduce CE only at higher quantiles in China. and (Cai et al., 2021 ) argued that GT promote GT in Western region of China. In Model 2, the study finds that GT is positively associated with ET demonstrating that GT expands ET. Although previously only limited studies have tried to explore the role of GT on ET and therefore the study is in line with those studies that have explored positive association between GT and renewable energy consumption because enhancing renewable energy supports the ET process. In this regard, the finding matches with Maasoumi et al. (2021)  for OECD countries, Ramzan et al. (2023)  for the USA and Han et al. (2023b)  for E−7 countries as these studies assert that expansion of GT promotes the availability of renewable energy. The study findings are also supported by the study of Hordofa et al. (2023)  as they argued that GT stimulates low-carbon transition of energy structure. Specifically, GT transforms the energy sector by introducing clean production and low carbon technologies More particularly, GT provide ample support for the production of geothermal, solar, wind, tidal, wave, bio energy and hydro sources of energy all of which support ET process. Moreover, the finding of Adebayo and Kirikkaleli (2021)  also strongly support these findings who assert that GT lead to transition from non renewable to renewable energy by enhancing advanced climate technologies which maintain the processes of renewable energy and energy efficiency. In Model 1, the coefficients of economic growth and square are significantly positive and negative in FMOLS and DOLS estimations indicating that economic growth deteriorates environmental quality in selected countries. The possible reason for this positive effect can be rise in energy consumption associated with increased economic activities and industrial productions which causes environmental quality to worsen. Economic growth is also responsible for the over exploitation of the NR particularly the extraction of NR in unsustainable ways which causes environmental degradation (Z. Liu et al., 2022 ). The rise in economic growth fuels industrialization process, and resource use across all economic sectors, leading to an increase in CE and environmental deterioration (Majeed et al., 2021 ). But square term of economic growth is negative and significant in FMOLS and DOLS findings indicating that economic growth after passing a certain threshold level lowers the environmental degradation consistent with EKC hypothesis. Thus the findings of the study validate the EKC hypothesis in selected countries. This negative coefficient of economic growth square indicates the after passing a certain threshold level, more advancements in technologies can cause economic growth to improve the environmental quality (Dogan and Turkekul, 2016 ). After passing a certain income level, economy faces structural transformation and increase in income level promotes environmental sustainability. Moreover, after passing a certain threshold, economy becomes more service based rather than capital intensive economy (Bilgili et al., 2016 ) The finding of the study are similar to those provided by Adedoyin et al. (2020)  as they observed positive contribution of economic growth in CE in BRICS countries. Anwar et al. (2020)  also observed that CE rises by rising growth in Far East countries. However, Dogan and Turkekul (2016)  does not found EKC hypothesis to be valid in the case of the USA. Likewise, in the case of UK, Spain and Denmark, (Beşe and Kalayci, 2021 ) concluded the absence of EKC hypothesis. As per Model 2, positive role of economic growth is found in ET in both FMOLS and DOLS estimations. This implies that higher level of economic growth is associated with rising income. The reason for this finding is that economic growth raises the income level in an economy which ensures the availability of the funds required for the transition towards renewable sources for energy use. Increased demand for energy due to higher economic growth leads to increased investments in renewable energy and the promotion of eco-friendly energy that facilitate ET in the long run (S. Zhang et al., 2023 ). The finding is supported by the earlier estimations of Dinh et al. (2022)  for ASEAN, Al-Mulali et al. (2013)  and (Tugcu et al., 2012 ) for G-7 countries. But the findings of (Han et al., 2023a ) strongly contradicts our finding as they argued that economic growth does not promote ET. The results indicate positive association between urbanization and CE in FMOLS and DOLS estimations indicating that urbanization leads to environmental degradation. The reason for this finding is the failure of these economies to implement environmental friendly strategies during urbanization processes. Moreover, many infrastructure projects, like building highways and bridges, are necessary during the early stages of urbanization, which increases energy consumption and CE in turn (Wang et al., 2018 ). Urbanization also impacts the physical environment by changing the behavior of the people and local community, and their resources’ needs (Majeed et al., 2021 ). Previously many research studies have found the similar finding like X. Liu and Bae (2018)  observed that urbanization is associated with rise in environmental degradation in China. R. Ali et al. (2019)  concluded a positive association between urbanization and CE. Anwar et al. (2020)  found that urbanization increased CE in Far East countries. However, Yao et al. (2018)  in case of China and Sharma (2011)  for 69 countries argued that urbanization actually reduced CE. In contrast, in Model 2, the results of FMOLS and DOLS estimations reveal significant and negative impact of urbanization on ET implying that urbanization is a hurdle in the way of ET in the studied economies. A possible reason for this unexpected finding can be the abuse of the energy intensive resources such as coal and oil as during structural transformations associated with higher urbanization (Lv et al., 2020 ). Empirically, the findings of A. S. Ullah et al. (2023)  and Lantz et al. (2021)  in case of Italy strongly favour our findings as these studies also conclude negative association between urbanization and ET. But the findings of Shahbaz et al. (2022)  does not favour our findings as they found that urbanization promotes ET. Considering the moderating role of FT on the relationships of GT and NR with ET and CE reveals interesting findings. FT is found to significantly and positively moderate the negative impact of GT on CE in Model 1, and positive impact of GT on ET in Model 2. A possible explanation of this positive moderating effect is the facilitation of FT in provision of financial services required for the deployment of GT or renewable energy technologies in ET process and projects concerning the sustainability of the environment. FT leverage digital technologies, ease the capital access and reduction in the financing cost of innovations motivating firms to create new, low-pollution products, so indirectly reducing the use of dirty energy which helps in promoting CE reduction and increase in ET (H. Li et al., 2023 ; H. Lu et al., 2016 ). In addition, FT also reduces information asymmetry by attenuating funding impediments that firms face while investing in GT innovations. Moreover, FT acts as a catalyst to reinforce regulatory process and government insight (J. Liu et al., 2023 ). Since no previous study has analyzed the moderating effect of FT on the relationship between GT with CE and ET, the findings are partially in line with (Xue et al., 2022 ) for China as they found FT promote GT development and (H. Li et al., 2023 ) as the argued that FT promote ET in China. Likewise, the findings of Coffie et al. (2022)  are also partially in line with our results by concluding positive role of FT in CE reduction. However, no significant moderating effect of FT is found on NR and CE and NR and ET relationships. Although it is plausible that FT technologies and financial sector holds significant implications for efficiently utilizing resources and mobilization of the resources to create opportunities (Tan et al., 2023 ), but FT penetration is more in countries having higher level of GDP and ease of doing business ranking. Among the countries included in our panel, only China and UK have the higher penetration of FT in economic activities as compare to the USA, Canada, Australia and rest of the panel countries (Tsaran, 2022 ). This lower penetration of FT services in economy might prevent FT to significantly moderate the relationship of NR with CE and ET. The findings of our study partially coincide with the results provided by (Çoban and Topcu, 2013 ) as their study does not conclude any significant association between financial sector and ET. After long run coefficient estimation using FMOLS and DOLS techniques, MMQR estimation approach is applied for robustness estimation at different quantiles. Table 7  provides the corresponding findings for Model 1 and Model 2. Surprisingly the sign of the parameters are similar to those find in FMOLS and DOLS approaches but significance varies at different quantile levels. First, like previous estimations, FT affects CE negatively but its impact is significant only at lower quantiles (0.10–0.40) and at higher quantiles, its impact is insignificant (though negative). In Model 2, similar to previous estimation, the coefficient of FT is positive and significant over entire quantile range (0.1–0.90) indicating that FT promotes ET. Similar to FMOLS and DOLS approaches, the coefficient of NR is statistically significant and positive at all quantiles (0.10–0.90) for both Model 1 and Model 2, revealing that NR leads to increased CE and ET. For Model, the impact of GT on CE is negative and significant only at medium to higher quantiles (0.40–0.90), whereas in Model 2, GT impacts ET significantly and positively from lower to higher quantiles (0.10–0.70) and its impact becomes insignificant at higher most quantiles (0.80–0.90). Likewise, MMQR results reveal significant and positive impact of GDP at all quantiles (0.10–0.90) for both Model 1 and Model 2 reavelaing the positive contribution of GDP in CE and ET. However, for Model 1, GDP2  has negative and significant effect on CE at higher quantiles. (0.60–0.90). Last MMQR indicates that urbanization significantly and positively affects CE at all quantiles in Model 1, but has negative and significant effect on ET only at lower quantiles (0.10–0.50) in Model 2. In case of interaction terms, MMQR exactly replicates the FMOLS and DOLS findings. The interaction term between FT and GT in Model 1 is positive and significant at all quantiles but in Model 2, the interaction term is significant and positive only at 0.10–0.60 quantiles. These findings reveal that FT positively moderate the relationship of GT with CE and ET. However, similar to DOLS, FMOLS estimations, interaction term between FT and NR is insignificant in both Models in MMQR findings.  5 Conclusion The present study estimated the role of GT and NR in achieving sustainable development goals (SDG 7 and SGD 13) under the moderating effect of FT in resource abundant countries over the period from 2000 to 2021. To fulfill the study objectives, two models are formulated representing the respective SDG: Model 1 for CE and Model 2 for ET. The data is analyzed using robust panel estimation techniques including FMOLS, DOLS and MMQR regressions. According to findings of FMOLS, DOLS and MMQR (at different quantiles), FT and GT have positive contribution in achieving SDG 7 and SDG 13 as they have negative impact on CE and positive impact on ET. However, NR affects both CE and ET positively indicating that NR has positive contribution in achieving ET but negative contribution in achieving environmental sustainability. Moreover, the study findings also established that FT does not significantly moderate the effect of NR on CE and ET in FMOLS, DOLS and MMQR, but it significantly and positively moderate the nexus between GT, CE and ET. Hence the study concludes that FT and GT have massive potentials to reduce CE and increase the ET level in selected resource abundant countries which are blameworthy for polluting the environment. However, there is massive room for the improvement in the proper utilization of NR in resource abundant countries which can enhance ET and reduce CE. 5.1 Recommendations and limitations of the study Based on these findings, recommendations are provided to policy makers and governments of the respective countries that will help in making decisions to achieve sustainable development. The resource abundant countries have witnessed massive growth rates and therefore energy consumption has become more intense than before. These countries are blessed with a plenty of NR and therefore, these countries must focus more on efficiently utilize NR especially in renewable energy projects. In this regard, comprehensive NR revenue management and transparent and fare institutions are required and institutional development and effective management policies are necessary for this purpose. Not only managing NR carefully, policymakers and governments must promote FT and GT to achieve carbon neutrality and ET. In order to address a worsening of the environment and transition of energy sector towards renewable energy, government officials and policy makers in the resource abundant economies must come up with plans to have greater investment in GT and FT. Specifically, the USA, China, Canada are ranked among the technologically advanced economies, therefore these countries should use cutting-edge technologies for promoting their sustainable development. The governments of resource rich countries must take initiatives to implement policies in the favour of GT and facilitate spending to promote the green investment initiatives. The governments must initiate new initiatives for GT and FT and research and development. In order to generate creative programs, government agencies should collaborate with the business community. Investors must be trained to have investments in companies that are making significant efforts to reduce their adverse impact on environment by implementing GT, and policies must be developed and implemented for corporate sector's encouragement to take such actions. Moreover, integrating GT and FT in energy sector would be helpful for the investors to invest in sustainable development projects and have a substantial financial return which would aid the government to accelerate the pace of ET towards renewable and more sustainable energy system. These environment related policies, GT, and green investments would be helpful in confirming that environmental and social issues are solved thereby promoting sustainable development in resource rich countries. There are certain limitations of the current study which provides room for future research studies to explore them. First, the study analyzed the role of GT, FT and NR on ET and CE in resource abundant countries, making the findings of the study less generalize able and reliable. Future research studies may replicate the analysis in the context of other countries, panel of the countries or individual countries. Similarly, several existing blocs of the countries like BRICS, ASEAN, N-11, G-20 etc can also be taken into consideration for the study. Secondly, the study considered FT to estimate its moderating role in the subject matter. Future research studies can consider several other variables such as governance, environmental regulations, government stability, democracy, digitalization etc to explore their moderating effect in the subject matters. In methodological aspects, there is a room for future studies to employ more latest estimation approaches including AMG, CCEMG, CS-ARDL, QARDL, DARDL etc.   CRediT authorship contribution statement Zhaojiang Lv:  Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review & editing.
