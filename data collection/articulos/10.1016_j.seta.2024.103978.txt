Introduction Over the past decade, the journal Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments  (SETA ) has been at the forefront of research and innovation in the field of sustainable energy [1–3] . With a strong focus on the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this journal has made significant contributions to the advancement of sustainable development worldwide [4–6] . The overexploitation of natural resources has led to the rapid depletion of highly depleted natural resources [7] . If remedial actions are not taken by 2030, the quality of human life is expected to be significantly impacted ([8] , 2023 agenda). In addition to food security, natural catastrophe, and global warming, the energy crisis is a major threat to human survival on Earth. This has generated an urgent need for advanced technologies capable of offering sustainable energy sources and addressing the imminent energy crisis [9] . Sustainable energy technologies have become a significant focus in recent years because of the pressing need for sustainable development across the globe [10] . The SETA  started in 2013 and covers a diverse range of topics within the realm of sustainable energy technologies, including but not limited to renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and distribution, energy generation, storage and conversion, and energy policy and economics. Each article published in SETA  undergoes a rigorous review process, ensuring that only high-quality research is presented to its readership. The journal is indexed in all reputed databases, such as Scopus, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Inspec (IET), and SCImago, within a short span of time with a high impact factor. According to the Journal Citation Report (JCR) for 2023, SETA  has an impressive impact factor of 8.00. This signifies that articles published in SETA  between 2021 and 2022 were cited a minimum of eight times in journals indexed in the Web of Science. In line with Scopus, SETA  achieved a CiteScore of 8.4 in 2022, indicating that its research gained an average of 8.4 citations in Scopus during the period from 2019 to 2022.

Furthermore, Google Scholar identifies SETA  as the 17th among its top 20 notable outlets publishing on sustainable energy in 2022. These metrics explicitly affirm the global recognition of the journal among peers and the broader scientific community. One of the key strengths of the SETA  lies in its multidisciplinary outlook. It brings together researchers from various fields, including engineering, economics, environmental science, and policy, to foster collaboration and innovation. This multidisciplinary perspective is crucial in addressing the complex challenges associated with transitioning to sustainable energy systems. The contributions of SETA  to the SDGs are evident in a multitude of ways. For example, articles published in the journal have shed light on novel renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaics [11–14] , wind turbines [15–16]  and bioenergy systems [17–18] , which can significantly contribute to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) by increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Additionally, the journal has explored the role of energy efficiency in achieving multiple SDGs, including SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure). Researchers have presented innovative approaches to improve energy performance in buildings [19] , industrial processes [20–21] , and transportation systems (Wang et al., 2013), thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable industrialization. Furthermore, the journal has addressed the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable energy technologies through its articles examining the socioeconomic implications of renewable energy deployment, highlighting the potential for job creation, poverty reduction, and improved health outcomes [22–23]  . It has also explored the environmental impacts of different energy technologies, assessing their life cycle emissions, resource consumption, and ecological footprints [24] . Considering the extensive and diverse perspectives in SETA , a classical or systematic review might be constrained in its scope to clarify the structural landscape of SETA  topics, map its topical diversity and SDG linkages, and methodically guide the future direction [25–27] . Therefore, by employing scientometrics and topic modeling analysis, we offer a comprehensive examination of SETA , investigating its descriptive content, thematic elements, and linkages to SDGs [28–29] . These studies are burgeoning in the literature. For example, Donthu et al. [30]  examined and mapped the intellectual framework of the research published in the “Journal of Knowledge Management (JKM) ” from 1977 to 2021. Kumar et al. [31]  conducted a comprehensive scientometric analysis and longitudinal SDG mapping of the “Quality and Reliability Engineering International (QREI)”  Journal from 1985 to 2022. Raman et al. [32,33]  examined the bibliometric patterns of publications of the “IEEE Access”  journal from 2013 to 2020. Pattnaik et al. [34]  conducted a retrospective review of the “Australian Accounting Review (AAR)” during its initial 30 years of publication from 1991 to 2020. Donthu et al. [35]  analyzed forty-five years of the impact of the “Journal of Business Research (JBR)” . Unfortunately, no one has attempted to investigate SETA  quantitatively and qualitatively since its inception, although such an examination is crucial for comprehensively mapping the journal’s intellectual discourse, offering in-depth insights beyond what is evident on the surface by permeating into the journal’s quality, maturity, and productivity [36] . To be precise, we ask the following research questions, limiting our investigative focus to SETA ’s contributions to the SDGs.• RQ1: What is the overall research performance of the SETA ?  • RQ2: How well does research in SETA  map to SDGs?  • RQ3: How does SETA’s  research demonstrate an interdisciplinary approach in the context of the SDGs?  • RQ3: What are the key research themes in SETA , and what keywords best describe these themes?  • RQ5: Through BERTopic modeling, what new topics and their connections to SDGs have been discovered in SETA ? Can we identify key publications that exemplify these topics?    The primary contribution of our study lies in conducting a thorough content analysis of SETA’s contribution to the SDGs covering its initial eleven years. This study is the first to employ a cocitation network to identify the major SDG-focused research clusters within SETA publications. Our keyword co-occurrence analysis further delineates SETA’s thematic clusters, highlighting its distinct research foci in sustainable energy technologies. Additionally, we utilize BERTopic modeling to uncover latent topics within SETA, marking a novel and methodologically robust approach. Our study critically examines the interplay between technology and policy, emphasizing the need for adaptive policy frameworks that consider socioeconomic impacts, especially on vulnerable populations. We propose future research directions vital for advancing sustainable energy systems, such as international cooperation and climate finance mechanisms. Our research provides actionable insights for practitioners and policymakers, fostering a more sustainable and equitable global energy landscape. This work is original in its comprehensive approach, integrating various advanced analytical techniques to provide a nuanced understanding of SETA’s role in promoting SDGs. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the data and study methods. Section 3 is dedicated to the analysis of our findings. Section 4 discusses the themes and their SDG mapping. We conclude in Section 5, summarizing the main takeaways of our research and discussing their implications for stakeholders.  Methods Fig. 1   illustrates the study’s research design. PRISMA protocol Our review leverages the PRISMA guidelines, following a five-step methodology encompassing the definition of research questions, development of a search strategy, execution of the literature search, screening of search results, and synthesis of the data [37] . By adhering to PRISMA’s structured methodology, we bolster the credibility of our systematic review, recognized for its methodological rigor across various research domains [38,39] .  Literature search and selection We carried out a literature search in the Dimensions database on January 22, 2024, reviewing publications from 2013 to 2023. The Dimensions database was chosen because it provides broader journal coverage than the Web of Science and Scopus databases do [40] . Searching for the journal “Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments” yielded 3280 publications. In the screening stage, we scrutinized each publication for completeness, excluding 18 records (Erratum-13; Editorial-5) from the analysis. This left a total of 3262 records. As our motive was not to conduct a review of reviews, we excluded review articles (n = 144). Finally, 3118 articles are included for detailed review, highlighting the effectiveness of the PRISMA framework in executing a thorough literature review. Our analysis used the built-in feature of the Dimensions database (from Digital Science), which automatically maps articles to SDGs on the basis of proprietary AI/ML algorithms.  SDG framework To understand how SETA research covers interdisciplinary topics, we look at the SDGs as a guide [32,33,41] . When we explore how these goals connect, it is clear that making progress on one goal often helps us advance in others, too. Research by Le Blanc [42]  shows that these goals are linked in various ways—some connections are strong and direct, whereas others are weaker and not as obvious. Aligning SETA ’s research with the SDGs illuminates the journal’s engagement with these interconnected global challenges.  Co-citation networks We apply cocitation mapping to reveal the interconnectedness of the SDGs [38] . With VOSviewer, we visualize the semantic relationships between SDGs on the basis of joint citation frequency [43] . This network of SDGs is depicted as a complex yet integrated structure, with node size and line thickness indicating citation prominence and cocitation strength, respectively.  Topic modeling Our study adopts the BERTopic method for advanced topic modeling, employing transformer models and the Class-Tf-idf-Transformer for discerning topic clusters [44] . BERTopic, with its use of BERT’s contextual embeddings, excels at identifying nuanced semantic links. The process includes extensive data preprocessing, NLP application, and tokenization, leading to enhanced data quality and consistency. The methodology culminates with sentence embeddings and dimensionality reduction, enabling precise topic classification and visualization [45] . Through probabilistic metrics, BERTopic assigns topics to documents, refines interpretability and underscores the study’s analytical depth.
