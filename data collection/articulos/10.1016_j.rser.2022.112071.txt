The VSI collected both high quality review papers and original research articles presented at the 4 SDEWES conferences in 2020 belonging to the aims and scope of RSER. After a scrutinizing peer review process, 20 articles were accepted and published. These articles fall into four main areas: renewable energy cutting edge technologies, energy storage, energy modelling techniques and, climate and energy policy and impacts. Cross-areas articles belong to this Special Issue covering almost all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   Keywords Renewable and sustainable energy systems  Energy storage  Energy modelling techniques  Climate and energy policy  Impact analysis    1 Introduction This editorial is in strong connection with the previous editorial initiatives taken in RSER itself in 2019 [1 ], 2018 [2 ], 2017 [3 ] and other eminent Journals such as Renewable Energy [4 ,5 ], Energy Conversion & Management [6–8 ], Energy [9–11 ] and Energies [12–14 ] together with milestone works published in those Journals outside the SDEWES Conferences and in other high-ranked sources. Twenty scientific articles published in the SDEWES 2020 Special Issue of Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews will be presented in detail [15–34 ] covering four main research areas addressing a similar number of challenges open in the scientific community that find the suitable place of debate in the four Conferences on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems held in (i) Buenos Aires Argentina (Latin American SDEWES 2020), in (ii) Gold Coast, Australia (Asia Pacific SDEWES 2020), in (iii) Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovina (South East European SDEWES 2020) and in (iv) Cologne, Germany (SDEWES 2020). Those editions faced the restrictions of COVID-19 from lockdown period (March–May 2020) to the so-called second wave infection (August–October 2020) maintaining a strong participation in hybrid and online modes and a high-quality of scientific outcomes looking at the papers published in this Special Issue and the other Supporting Journals such as Renewable Energy [35 ], Energy Conversion & Management [36 ], Fuel [37 ], Optimization and Engineering [38 ], Sustainability [39 ] and many others. In this Editorial, a focus on four main areas is done and enriched by cross-areas publications listed and commented here below. The four main areas are related to (a) renewable and sustainable energy cutting edge technologies, (b) energy storage, (c) energy modelling techniques, (d) climate and energy policy and impacts.  2 Renewable and sustainable energy cutting edge technologies Recently, strong attention was gained by marine renewables starting from wave energy converters and related decision-making process for optimal location and integration [15 ] to tides and tidal current [40 ] with detailed modelling of the source [41 ] together with innovative system architecture [42 ] besides the established interest for offshore wind development supported by more accurate satellite data [43 ] and reanalysis methods [44 ]. The first paper of this SDEWES 2020 dedicated Special Issue authored by Chopin et al. [15 ] reviewed the procedures for selecting the most suitable wave energy converter solutions. Mapping activities to identify the hotspot location and related wave-farm installations are described. Different spatial-resolution models and the elaboration of an index to rank areas by the pairs’ energy response to the energy demand were presented. This is an interesting contribution since wave energy is less studied compared to solar one. Indeed, solar deployment at urban level keeps being demonstrated as a strong option to integrate more renewables in cities [16 ] for both electricity and heating and cooling purposes [45 ]. The analyses are already advanced including the final use in the built environment, its physical features [46 ] and possible improvements. The second paper by Fuster-Palop et al. [16 ] provides a model to determine the economic payback period for installing PV on the buildings' roof using dimensionless parameters and presenting the results in a simple way for the easy understanding of final users. This can solve the gap between very detailed and complex models used by scientists and their results’ communication to non-expert final adopters. Bottino-Leone et al. in the third paper [17 ] highlight the importance of players often neglected by the refurbishment interventions as the wind effects on the façade. These effects could be crucial especially in those buildings where refurbishment is more expensive due to architectural constraints. In fact, preservation calls for limited interventions such internal insulation. This the case ofhistoric built environment. It is ground of investigation for compatible renewable technologies integration too like the building integrated photovoltaics [47 ] and for indoor and outdoor thermal comfort of the urban fabrics [48 ] before planning new interventions. While, for wind energy integration [49 ] fewer applications at building scale are seen. More and more frequent extreme events lead to further resilience assessment [50 ] to keep the operation of fabrics and infrastructures [51 ]. At the same time, increasing attention to the bioclimatic principles of historic architecture guides research on wind benefits like the catchers [52 ] even equipped with dedicated heat recovery systems [53 ]. Followed by innovative business model valorizing the prosumer role [54 ], the urban district becomes the ideal scale of energy efficiency applications as proven in diverse Countries in Ref. [55 ]. As a matter of fact, fossil-based processes still hard to be substituted with renewable-based ones receive high attention as well. Natural Gas processing to obtain different products such as ammonia is deeply investigated in Ref. [18 ] while, sustainable Gas-To-Wire pathways are proposed and analysed in Ref. [19 ]. The fourth paper by Moura et al. [18 ] presents an alternative process based on the bi-reforming of Natural Gas, for both producing ammonia and urea as well as reducing the carbon dioxide associated to the conventional process. It needs a supporting economic scheme to become viable on the market and widespread. In the fifth paper [19 ], Bolsoni Carminati et al. compared new and conventional energy processes. They targeted three objectives: high revenues from exporting the electricity, mitigating the long-distance gas transportation issues, and proposing alternative carbon dioxide destination. The economic aspect is still the concern due to the innovative pathway, but the further cost is small compared the advantages presented by the authors. Addressing contemporary the growth of renewables and the improvements of still inevitable fossil fuel-based processes is one of the key aspect of SDEWES scientific debate. More detailed techniques give the option to immediately increase the efficiency [56 ] as well as prepare the ground for partially substituting the fossil fuel [57 ] or even switching to a different supply such as waste [58 ]. In the light of a circular economy perspective, it is fundamental to valorize what is the waste of a process as the source for another one. This is as the case of waste heat [59 ], where a by-product is used to meet another kind of energy demand. Indeed, research activities proceed fast in harvesting waste heat by turbines [60 ] or in high efficiency cogeneration systems [61 ]. Conventional solutions are tested with synthetic fuels like synthetic methane meant as pathway to keep using the existing infrastructures and to store renewable energy [62 ].  3 Energy storage The energy storage systems face the crucial challenge of the mismatch between renewable energy production and user consumption as well as the quality of the matched one [63 ]. At the small scale a chosen technology increases its performance thanks to the novel material adopted with thermophysical properties tailored on the purpose such as the phase change interval [20 ] or the innovative use in a different sector [64 ]. The sixth paper by Wang et al. [20 ] analyses the thermodynamic behaviour of a Phase Change Material playing as cooler by a heat pipe where it is installed in relationship with the heating power and fan power. Once the commercial availability challenge is faced, the integration of a technology in real project is the second challenge. Optimal sizing is the issue to be tailored onthe context where the technology is installed from an economic perspective [65 ] and from an energetic one [66 ]. The presence of different perspectives leads to multi-criteria analysis by giving priority or weight to indicators even across sectors such as the strategy of storing energy via chemicals or by creating new raw materials [21 ]. Lopes et al. in the seventh paper [21 ] identified the potential sources of CO2  (from power plants to ethanol fermentation) and H2  (from dedicated production to by-product hydrogen) for their combination to create chemicals. The possible matches have been assessed from were evaluated by environmental, economic, and technical point of views and finally ranked considering all their performance. Moving up to large scale like National energy systems, storage entails infrastructures to be planned [67 ] and large power determining as in the case of hydropower large land use if the geographical features allow it and the importance of the planning phase at increasing construction [22 ]. For this purpose, the eight paper by Raupp [22 ] describes a more sustainable concept of hydropower plant able to balance energetic, economic and socio-environmental consequences supported by the elaboration of an index to improve the Hydropower Inventory for selecting the best choice. Key requirements of such large-scale projects are carefully analysed in recent literature [68 ] and supported by new technologies such as satellite data analysis [69 ]. This scale is becoming the target of initiatives for converting excess of renewable energy in several carriers or chemicals [70 ]. Among those options, hydrogen became a hot topic just before the pandemic calling for further R&D activities [71 ] to look at it as solution for the heating sector [72 ], pillar of the transport sector supply by means of innovative refuelling stations [73 ] and high pressure infrastructures [74 ], or in a less demanding role as integrative contribution to improve the economics and flexibility of conventional power cycles [75 ] or to enhance the efficiency of some industrial facilities [76 ]. However, established technologies as Li-on batteries still require attention in stationery and mobility applications [77 ] or as part of the technological solutions kit for constrained environments, e.g. islands [78 ], or to couple different sectors such as water and energy [79 ] accounting carefully for the modelling assumptions to pre-design it.  4 Energy modelling techniques Performance driven decision making relies on modelling and simulation techniques that identify the best pathway to achieve a given goal. The choice of the best model to be adopted is a very tough issue since performance gap becomes critical in operation phase [80 ] but primarily in selecting the best solution in parametric design [81 ] considering design and off-design performance in addition to the non-predictability of some energy sources [82 ]. The context where the solution or the set of them has to be applied strongly affects the model selection together the quality and quantity of desired results and input data [83 ]. Indeed, overview of the models and their features applied to the same context provides the chance to observe their operation and to select the most suitable to your own case. Prina et al. [23 ] in the ninth paper gave an overview of the bottom-up energy system models applied at island level. They inspected the mostly used models for insular applications, the required constraints for this scale and the challenges of the research field. The models able to directly consider reliability and robustness of the power grid constraints are the unit commitment ones while simplified procedures are used to adapt most common energy planning software. On the contrary, if one aspect such as the techno-economic one should drive the decision towards the feasibility of a solution, models can be of different types such as simulation [24 ] or surrogate [25 ] or even involving optimization techniques due to the multiple objectives to achieve [26 ]. The tenth paper authored by Barone et al. [24 ] addresses the ships energy systems introducing a novel approach for their sustainable design accounting for partial load regimes derived from variable energy requirements together with relative response of innovative energy saving technologies. It contributes to modern early design of onboard energy systems. The eleventh paper by Lapenda Wiesberg et al. [25 ] proposed surrogate models within a framework for evaluating the substitution of fossil fuels with biomass. The biorefinery scenarios are analysed in terms of investment assisted by carbon capture and storage options. Esteves et al. [26 ] in the twelfth paper addresses biomass research too but with the synergies with livestock for integrated crop-livestock system. Two life-cycle performance metrics are adopted and with the aim to drive private and public decision-making in the agro-energy sector. Furthermore, the set boundaries primarily affect the results and the eventual decision especially if a target like decarbonization actually involves all the sectors [84 ]. Besides it, the inclusion of new factors can be disruptive in the model's outcomes such as the human behaviour in building energy modelling [85 ], technological and spatial issues [86 ] or, as done just recently, the willingness or attitude to participate in the energy transition [27 ]. To this extent, the thirteenth paper by Piselli et al. [27 ] is related to the human-centric energy transition combining user engagement and technological solutions to achieve energy efficient communities. The authors found out that people engagement in energy communities is essential to reach the expected energy transition targets both from achieving neutral balance in an occupied building and from asking energy neutral settlements to the construction players. Business models are often neglected in building the model leaving the economic performance to basic assessment by post-processing the output values. The inclusion of ICT and the call for smartness in the energy sector brings priority to the business model selection [28 ]. Manfren et al. [28 ] in the fourteenth paper explain why techno-economic analysis and energy modelling are key enablers of smart energy services and technologies in buildings today. They emphasized the essential components of Life Cycle Cost (LCC) accounting, Energy Performance Contracts (EPC) based and innovative business models, and regression-based approaches for energy analytics. Another aspect to be highlighted is the point of view considered for evaluating the best outcome that would be very different in the utility shoes [87 ], in the community ones [88 ] or target-oriented with the least required expenditure [89 ]. The results must be carefully checked if in compliance with the adopted policies such as prioritizing a source strongly disincentivized [90 ]. Here, the transparency and, subsequently, the replicability of the outcomes do matter entailing the openness of the input data [91 ]. Municipalities and districts are the most studied scale by advanced dynamic simulation techno-economic analysis [92 ] together with the inclusion of exergy as a performance indicator [93 ]. Further details and visualization opportunities are provided by mapping energy demand [94 ] and useful interaction occurs with studies on the past, present and future of an energy source to be harvested like the case of wind energy [95 ] and predictability methods [96 ]. Project control is essential to make things happen [97 ] after careful evaluation of economic expenditures of proposed decarbonization scenarios [98 ] and contemporary impact of energy sector development on the innovation [99 ].  5 Climate and energy policy and impacts The outcome of modelled and simulated scenarios are the values for choices' impact and the ground of policies’ elaboration to provide viable pathways to reach the intended targets [100 ]. To wide the beneficiaries of the scenarios, social acceptance [101 ] and societal cost-benefit analysis can be adopted [29 ]. The fifteenth paper by Lopez et al. [29 ], indeed, found out that subsidies and incentives should be provided to the electric vehicles’ deployment since societal cost-benefit parity with traditional internal combustion vehicles is achieved within the decade. This could be further promoted by also involving the production of electric vehicles and not only their acquisition on the market. In the same field but in Chinese contexts, the effects of electric vehicle promotion have been assessed in Ref. [102 ] while a comprehensive overview of its benefit is given in Ref. [103 ]. A similar scaling up can be useful when many contributors act to achieve a target like the case of the EU27 Countries for the continental adopted policy targets [30 ]. Wang et al. in the sixteenth paper [30 ] investigated the practicability of Water-Energy extended nexuses towards Sustainable Development Goals focusing the attention on the need of standardized and quantified characteristics or components for a clear classification of nexus studies due to the complex methods, the multi-region and multi-sector extensions and the spatio-temporal databases to be kept updated. In this way, the peculiar features have to be counted for the suitability of the solution [104 ] and related promoting policy and subsidy schemes [105 ]. An important feature is, for instance, the National energy mix composition and the derived effects [106 ]. Furthermore, local contexts require local climate-change effects to be modelled in order to assess their impact on the National strategies [107 ]. Another influential parameter strongly linked to the previous one is the Power Grid efficiency that affects performance and outcomes of analyses carried out on poly-generation systems [108 ]. Within a National context, the interplay of sectors concurs to the energy system performance too [109 ], harvesting the potential offered in terms of flexibility by the building stock [110 ] and by the electrification of transport [111 ] leading to the sustainable development with an economic development [31 ] and including the adaptation pathways to achieve them [112 ]. The seventeenth paper by Mainar Toledo et al. [31 ] highlighted the opportunity to accelerate the development economically and sustainably thanks to the energy cooperation and the sharing of services as seen in the three European Countries analysed by the authors. Co-transformation of several sectors is dealt in the eighteenth paper by Morghentaler et al. [32 ] where it offers a dynamic projection of future scenarios and the possible changes required to our systems and society to achieve so challenging SDGs underlining the symbiosis of energy and mobility sectors. A so complex analysis implies the assessment of environmental impact network and the associated shock that it can cause [33 ] to build a policy framework able to avoid stresses to the energy systems and to the environment [34 ] when a source or a technology is preferred, and stakeholder go all in on it. This is why guidelines for sustainable enterprises on how to plan their resources [113 ] and the impact on the market [114 ] are fundamental plus the critical analysis of industrial decarbonization pathways reachable via a technology or an energy carrier [115 ]. Indeed, Sebestyen in the nineteenth paper [33 ] deeply investigated the environmental impact networks of renewable energy plants linked to their sizing. So doing, the impacts can be explored, and the implementation of more efficient mitigation strategies can take place once an informed choice of the technology to deploy is made. One case study of RES electricity as an effective mitigation strategy is presented in Ref. [116 ]. It leads to careful consideration of transmission network capacity together with possible expansion [117 ]. Knapek et al. in the twentieth and last paper of this Special Issue [34 ] specified the need for dedicated assessment of conventional and energy-dedicated crops. They demonstrated that the actual biomass potential is not only strongly diminished since initial estimates but also geographically diverged. This can certainly help in planning sustainable bioenergy supply chain up to biorefinery facilities that can actually reduce impacts and provide positive contributions to the sustainable development. Besides it, innovative approaches are provided to users in terms of big data analysis and methods to improve the process efficiency [118 ], in terms of assessment by considering nexus between several fields for identifying the sustainable use [119 ].  6 Conclusions This editorial gave an overview of the renewable and sustainable energy challenges dealt by the scientists actively contributing to the success and prestige of the Conferences on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems 2020 Editions. The four main areas dealt by the useful contributions of the SDEWES attendees as well as the members of the whole scientific community publishing in the high-ranked SDEWES partner Journals such as RSER itself are of primary interest. Novel solutions in the field of renewable and sustainable energy technologies have been analysed and their performance commented as well as their application foreseen to speed up the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. Energy storage is clearly a hot topic and from the single technology and its role in the planned scenarios at different scales, it attracts a fruitful debate. The debate is, furthermore, enriched by the new and/or improved modelling techniques able to include the different point of view of the energy system stakeholders and to interact between their selves allowing the co-transformation and co-evolution of society and technology. Finally, the impact analysis accounting for climate and energy fields completes the picture offered to the RSER Special Issue's readers about the complexity of such challenges but, at the same time, of the power of developed tools and models for elaborating better and more sustainable solutions to our daily life. The advances and the novel findings give hope to the successful achievements of ambitious policy targets to respond the climate emergency. SDEWES Conferences are one more time the field of the scientific debate producing knowledge and innovation for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems.
