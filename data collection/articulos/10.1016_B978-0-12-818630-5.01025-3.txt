               The fate of our futures has been increasingly tied to the prospects of educational change and advancement. The new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the global successors to the MDGs, have roped-in education more tightly for a seemingly more integrative role in the United Nations' new sustainable development agenda. The vision that is promoted through SDG 4 is to transform lives through education, recognizing the important role of education as a main driver of development and in achieving the other proposed SDGs. This article examines the core principles contained in SDG 4 and critically interrogates the values embedded in them, as well as assesses practical issues of relevance and implementation.

Keywords Sustainable Development Goal 4  Education and SDGs  SDGs and educational quality  Education for sustainable development   Introduction The fate of our futures has been increasingly tied to the prospects of educational change and advancement. From its entrance into the post-World War II era's incarnation of modernity that envisioned a more unified world, albeit one that is western defined and led, education has gained prominence as a human right. Subsequent education-specific initiatives—including Education for All (EFA), the Dakar Framework, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 2 and 3, and Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 2005–2014—have cemented education as a legitimate stakeholder in development discourses (Wulff, 2020 ). The new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the global successors to the MDGs, have roped-in education more tightly for a seemingly more integrative role in the United Nations' “plan of action for people, planet and prosperity” and “to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom” (United Nation, 2015 , p. 1). In fact, the Incheon Declaration, a declaration on education adopted at the World Education Forum in 2015, proclaims Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4 henceforth), Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all , the “‘unfinished business’ of the EFA agenda and the education-related MDGs” (UNESCO, 2016 , p. 7). The vision that is promoted through SDG 4 “is to transform lives through education, recognizing the important role of education as a main driver of development and in achieving the other proposed SDGs” (UNESCO, 2016 , p. 7). This article presents the core principles contained in SDG 4 and critically interrogates the values embedded in them, as well as assesses practical issues of relevance and implementation. The paper unfolds in the following manner: the next section briefly examines the emergence of SDG 4 out of MDG 2 and 3, as well as the basic structure and content of SDG 4. The section after this discusses the positive aspirations of SDG 4, noting how education is framed to advance its key Target by itself and in support of the overall SDG framework. The final section addresses some of the deep detractions of SDG 4, in particular its embedded values and how they may hinder some of the potentially liberatory goals of education. The paper ends with a brief conclusion that summarizes some of the key points.  Background to SDGs and SDG4 The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) succeeded the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which consisted of 8 Goals that were established for the period 2000–2015 geared toward addressing development problems of the Global South. The MDGs contained two education-related goals: Goal number 2 “To achieve universal primary education,” and Goal number 3 “To promote gender equality and empower women.” A common view is that while the MDGs did help create a global focus on development issues, there were significant flaws in their initial construction, focus, implementation and achievements (Hulme, 2009 ; Fehling et al., 2013 ). Among the more common detractions of the MDGs, they were described as “being created by only a few stakeholders without adequate involvement of developing countries and overlooking development objectives previously agreed upon” and being “unachievable and simplistic, not adapted to national needs, [did] not specify accountable parties and reinforce[d] vertical interventions” (Fehling et al., 2013 ). Yet others point to some important achievements. Ban Ki-Moon, then UN Secretary General, said the MDGs “produced the most successful anti-poverty movement in history,” and “helped to lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty, to make inroads against hunger, to enable more girls to attend school than ever before and to protect our planet” (p. 1109). He added that the MDGs “generated new and innovative partnerships, galvanized public opinion and showed the immense value of setting ambitious goals” (United Nations, 2015b ). Specifically related to the education goals, MDG Goals 2 and 3, their achievements are cited to include:• Enrollment in primary education in developing regions reached 91% in 2015, up from 83% in 2000.  • Among youth aged 15–24, the literacy rate has improved globally from 83% to 91% between 1990 and 2015  • The gap between girls/women and boys/men has narrowed (United Nations, 2015c ).    However, the MDGs’ educational failures were also seen as consequential; for instance the United Nations (2015b)  points out that there continue to be “large disparities in primary school enrollment, and the poorest and most disadvantaged children bear the heaviest burden” (p. 26). Increased enrollment did not necessarily translate to learning (an issue of quality), and while the gender gap had narrowed under the MDG 3 as evidenced by improved gender parity, equal treatment and learning outcomes were still problem areas. Importantly, too, the MDGs were silent on several marginalized groups (Wulff, 2020 ). Additionally, the combination of over-crowded, underequipped classrooms and unqualified teachers also reproduced patterns of inequality and exclusion, thus limiting the progress of the MDG Education goals (Wulff, 2020 ). The SDG 4 was supposed to address these MDG failures and tackle other challenges. In fact, the The Millennium Development Goals Report 2015  framed the task of the SDGs in this way:Drawing on lessons learned from the MDGs, interventions will have to be tailored to the needs of specific groups of children—particularly girls, children belonging to minorities and nomadic communities, children engaged in child labor and children living with disabilities, in conflict situations or in urban slums. Investing in the quality of education and ensuring a sustainable source of funding are also essential. United Nations (2015b , p. 27).   The SDGs emerged “out of the much wider agenda [than] the MDGs and evolved out of a hugely interactive process of meetings, lobbying and advocacy at every level, national, regional and international” (King, 2016 , p. 18). These new Goals were more global than the MDGs which were largely designed with a focus on developing countries. The SDGs promised to eradicate global poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change through the multipronged approach of achieving 17 integrated goals and 169 targets covering social, economic, and ecological issues the world faces today. There was a markedly different tone and process of designing the SDGs in important ways compared to the MDGs, which were developed by a small group of Westerners (Hulme, 2009 ). Thus, a fundamental difference between the SDGs and the MDGs is the adoption of a more “participatory” approach to developing the Global Goals. One of the initiatives that preceded and the SDGs was “The Future We Want,” a declaration that specified the need for greater inclusion of civil society and marginalized populations universally in the creation of global development policies. The UN also produced “A Million Voices,” a document that reflected input from governments, think tanks, NGOs, civil society, and academics regarding their aspirations for the post-2015 development framework. Additionally, the UN launched the “My World Survey” which allowed individuals across the globe to vote online for the top six issues they wished to see in the SDGs. These apparently more participatory initiatives, drawing from multiples sources, are different from the policy formulation process for the MDGs, which was left solely in the hands of a small group of UN experts (Hulme, 2009 ). Yet, even with this seemingly more open system of contributing to and developing the SDGs, some, like King (2016) , suggest it is important to ask questions about who had final control over how the texts were edited, and who took decisions on the education targets. McGrath and Nolan (2016)  also suggest that the highly technocratic process of indicator setting silences the voices of non-“experts” (p. 122). These issues are explored later in the paper. Rhetorically, the SDG's participatory emphasis is evident in the language used in the initiative's framework, including references to various documents developed to shape the SDGs, such as “A Million Voices” and the “My World Survey”. United Nations (2015)  noted that “The Goals and targets were the result of over two years of intensive public consultation and engagement with civil society and other stakeholders around the world, which paid particular attention to the voices of the poorest and most vulnerable” (p. 3). Similarly, the Framework's emphasis on working “in a spirit of global solidarity” (p. 10), “embark[ing] on a collective journey” (p. 1) to ensure that “no one will be left behind” (p. 1 and 3), and adopting a “people-centered approach” (p. 3 and 8) makes clear the SDGs' effort to appear participatory and reflective of the needs of all populations, particularly “the poorest and most vulnerable” (p. 3) The SDG framework utilizes unifying rhetoric, stressing the importance of all countries playing their part to “free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want to heal and secure our planet” (p. 1), and claims that “Never before have world leaders pledged common action and endeavor across such a broad and universal policy agenda” (United Nations 2015 , p. 18). On the surface then, by “involving” marginalized voices in the policy formation stages, by using unifying rhetoric, and by recognizing the role of governments in tailoring the SDGs to meet their own national contexts and realities, the SDGs appear highly participatory. This is the overall SDGs framework on which the SDG 4 is built.  The emergence and structure of SDG 4 Wulff (2020)  notes that the inclusion of a stand-alone Education Goal was not a foregone conclusion when negotiations for a new development agenda began; instead, the SDG 4 Education Goal came about due to mobilization of the education community, allied with education's first level ranking on the “My World Survey.” SDG 4 was designed with the intention of incorporating but also moving well beyond MDG 2 and 3 to take up important educational themes that were missing from these previous Development Goals. Thus, SDG 4 represents “a stronger and broader commitment to quality and equity in education” (Wulff, 2020 , p. 1) with individual targets that are much broader and covering areas that were absent from the MDG 2 and 3. Included in the SDG 4 are equitable access to primary and secondary education, early childhood development and pre-primary education, post-secondary/tertiary education of various forms, job-relevant skills, increased access for people with disabilities and other traditionally marginalized groups, adult literacy education, education for sustainable development, building of physical school facilities, increased scholarship abroad for higher education for students in low income countries, and increased teacher supply (see Table 1  ). Overall, improved quality and equitable access under a rights-based umbrella serve as underpinning principles of the SDG 4. Further, the notion of education for sustainable development attempts to make education a more cross-cutting theme relevant to the overall goal of sustainability the SDGs seek to convey, and tries to make education seem more integrative of the Goals (Wulff, 2020 ). SDG 4 has 10 targets, that is, specific, measurable objectives which are expected to contribute to achieving the overall goal (Outcome Targets range from 4.1 through 4.7, and Means of Implementation Targets are 4.a to 4.c.; see Table 1 ). There are also 11 global indicators and 32 thematic indicators, which are markers of change or continuity that are expected to enable the measurement of progress toward meeting each target set to achieve the broader education Goal. The indicators are spread across four monitoring levels—global, thematic, regional and national. UNESCO-UIS (2018)  notes that global level monitoring provides a global overview of progress toward each target, while thematic monitoring compares indicators within a specific sector (e.g., education, environment, energy, health) or cross-cutting themes (e.g., gender) and serves as a framework to track progress on a cross-nationally comparable basis. For regional monitoring, countries are expected to develop and agree to a set of indicators, and consider priorities and issues of common and shared interests of a particular region. National level monitoring is linked to the needs of national and sub-national governments in developing education sector plans and informing policies.  Optimism and virtues of SDG 4 Like the Education MDGs, the Education SDG, even more so, “is a valuable resource for lobbying and advocacy by civil society” (King, 2016 , p. 22; also see Dost, 2020 ). With a more expanded set of objectives, targets and principles, SDG 4 lays out a wider array of education-related aspirations to advance development and justice in the modern era. Compared to the MDG Education Goals, SDG 4 targets “are transformative in scope and ambition, and … they have the potential to challenge some of the pervasive forces in education” and are intended to be implemented under a rights-based approach (Wulff, 2020 , p. 3). The broader, more transformative nature of the SDGs has direct implications for education too, due to “their universality and pledge to overcome silos within sustainable development” (Wulff, 2020 , p. 11) which translate into the prospect of a global effort to address educational needs and for education to be considered in relation to all other goals and targets in the overall SDG agenda. Also, SDG 4 is significant in its endorsement of education for sustainable development. Target 4.7 is specific in its aspiration that “all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles …”. Thus a notion of the “public good is implicit in the general SDG vision in which education is mentioned in targets for food security, women's rights, decent work, health and equalities” (Allais et al., 2020 , p. 135) and sustainable development. Additionally, because the SDGs overall are framed as Global in nature, the educational goals are more inclusive of marginalized people outside of the Global South compared the MDGs which were specifically designed for developing countries. By the principles of the SDGs being applicable to wealthy industrialized nations, as well, those pockets of educational inequities in “developed” countries should become subject to greater scrutiny and policy change under a global mechanism that has universal relevance. The notion of inclusive education in the SDGs also takes more explicit forms under the umbrella of universal rights, for example, by “focusing on specific subgroups as target populations” such as “persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations” (Johnstone et al., 2020 , p. 97) as described in target 4.5 of Goal 4. Additionally, Goal 4 names other groups in various targets, including girls, rural children, students from developing countries, and small island developing states (SIDS) as educational rights bearers. Critically, indicators (as listed in 4.5.1) are attached to these targets that require member states to collect and provide data, which potentially creates an environment of verifiability and accountability and therefore accords rights of inclusion to various historically marginalized groups. As Johnstone et al. (2020)  note, such rights are plural in the sense that they are “concerned with the presence, participation, and achievement of all children and particularly with educational needs of populations that have been historically marginalized” (p. 98). In real world context, Do et al. (2020) , drawing on case study and evidence from Vietnam, conclude that these key rights-based elements in SDG 4 “can satisfactorily ensure the legal rights of ethnic minorities” (p. 15). Their study further note that by “… targeting substantive equality, these [aspects of SDG 4] resolve long-existing conflicts in equality law, while still focusing on human rights for underrepresented groups” (Do et al., 2020 , p. 3), by offering concrete and relevant interventions for vulnerable groups to take place. Another important aspect of SDG 4 is its movement of the education discourse beyond mere enrollment to one of learning outcomes and educational achievement. With this “quality turn,” as Sayed and Moriarty (2020)  refer to it, SDG 4 has brought about a focus on the quality of educational experiences compared to previous educational initiatives. The implication of SDG4's more qualitative focus is an “education in which one concentrates on each and every child as a whole, development of each student as social, emotion, mental, physical and cognitive irrespective of sex, gender, race, caste, religion, status and geographic location” (Rajput et al., 2020 , p. 104). And because SDG 4 focuses on “learning as opposed to access to education” (212) and “not just as an overarching goal but embedded in the target” (Sayed and Moriarty, 2020 , p. 195), notions of educational relevance, resource support, teacher quality, financing, among other educational issues, are forced to be parts of broader educational policy and planning. In this context, the promotion of lifelong learning also emerges as a key principle in SDG 4, going farther than the focus solely on universal primary and secondary education as was the case with the Education MDGs. With SDG 4, educational policy and practice agenda is extended from formal basic education to tertiary-higher education and continued learning and retooling for continued relevance of skills for the 21st century economy. The inclusion of higher education in SDG 4 is seen as a progressive development, keeping in mind that this level of education has traditionally been absent from previous education development initiatives, including the MDGs (Allais et al., 2020 ). It is noteworthy, too, that the often-limited educational capacities at the tertiary educational level in developing countries is recognized, and are support by international cooperation between developed and developing countries, and international scholarships as described in Target 4.b and Target 4.c. Here, there is a specific target to “substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries” (4.b) and “substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries” (4.c).  The limits and liabilities of SDG 4 Like the SDGs overall, SDG 4 mirrors some of the very challenges, tensions and contradictions of Western modernist development and global public policy/governance. As it relates to the former, modernist development is subject to critique of being a Western led universalizing agenda with notions of imperialism where powerful industrialized countries set and dominate the international development agenda (Klak, 1998 ; Nisbet, 1980 ). In such a system, as many critical scholars will point out, there are power imbalances that define historical and existing relations globally and locally, which impinge on who shapes the dominant development discourse and impacts what rights and responsibilities emerge (Dost, 2020 ). Specifically with regard to SDG 4, Wulff (2020)  suggests that because its contents were “agreed to by those in power in 2015, the agenda was bound to reproduce the power relations and imbalances of that time” (p. 2) (see also Dost, 2020 ; King, 2016 ). Likewise, differences in “level of development,” regional, national and local priorities, as well as culture, religious beliefs, among other issues, create tensions and potential divergences from Globally set educational targets. With regard to the issue of global public policy and governance, global development goals and initiatives, like the MDGs and the SDGs, must contend with the complexities and tensions of pursuing international cooperation in the context of national sovereignty and multiple development actors with different interests and varying levels of power (Stone, 2008 ; Barnett and Duvall, 2018 ; Marshall, 2013 ; Dost, 2020 ). Though the framers of SDG 4—including governments, international organizations, non-profits organization, and civil society—claimed to have been deliberate in their efforts to make the Goals seem participatory in its formulation, content, implementation and monitoring and evaluation, different stakeholders have highlighted crucial challenges in the development of SDG 4. One such challenge is that even though the SDG framework recognizes “different national realities, capacities and levels of development” and respects “national policies and priorities” (United Nations, 2015a , p. 21), the Western universalist nature of the Goals creates contradictions, tensions and inconsistencies between global and national (and regional) educational policy priorities (Ali, 2016 ). For example, when countries already have educational and regional plans that have been negotiated at every level but which do not consistently align with SDG 4, problems and tensions of various kinds can emerge, including a pressure to change national priorities through various forms of coercive global governance mechanisms including international aid (Ali, 2016 ; King, 2016 ). As Ali (2016)  highlights by drawing on the context of the Sindh Province of Pakistan where the long negotiated Education Sector Plan is “being undermined by the new exigencies of SDG-4 Targets,” educational planning becomes very difficult by the donor community who “continue to come with their own priority areas … with money attached to these priorities” (Ali, 2016 , p. 58). Where national priorities do take precedence, the notion of Global goals might not be so global after all, which may render the cost and effort of monitoring and evaluation SDG 4 at the global level for universality futile. Also, when there are such differences between national and global educational goals, monitoring and evaluation become challenging and the efficacy of the SDG 4 cannot be truly assessed. This problem also reflects three broader methodological challenges of measurement and comparison of goals at the global level as cited by UNESCO Institute of Statistics. The first is that “national, regional and global data on basic competencies in literacy and numeracy are frequently collected but cannot be used in an integrated manner to create a global picture of learning” (UNESCO-UIS, 2018 , p. 23). What this means is that different countries (or regions) use different assessment mechanisms rendering cross comparison of countries difficult or meaningless. Secondly, there is no shared technical standards to ensure data are of similar quality at national and regional levels. And third, is the challenge of taking into account the multiple viewpoints related to “what can and should be measured globally,” thinking of “how national and regional data can help inform global measurement,” and “striking an appropriate balance between global competencies and the role of local influences” and education goals (UNESCO-UIS, 2018 , p. 23). However, the most vociferous and consistent detraction of SDG 4 are the values that are embedded within the educational paradigm that the Goal endorses and is built on, which reflects some of the core Western visions of the world. A fundamental critique is that SDG 4 conforms to the same paradigm as that which has existed within the dominant modernist development agenda, which itself is built on colonial notions of coercion, hierarchies and universalism that favor Western ways and ideas (Sterling, 2016 ). For instance, SGD 4 is interpreted as fundamentally instrumentalist to the Western economic model, and committed to economic growth and therefore all other social, political, cultural and environmental imperatives are rendered subservient to the economic imaginary (Brissett and Mitter, 2017 ; Sterling, 2016 ). This adherence to the traditional development paradigm creates internal contradictions within SDG 4, because while it promises to liberate the world's dispossessed and marginalized peoples, its theory of change seems to be based on the very educational systems that have supported capitalist, growth-driven consumerism that have created inequities, and ruined societies and their natural environments in the first place (Komatsu and Rappleye, 2018 ; Dost, 2020 ). Rather than connecting various forms of human existence, education in the SDGs is primarily framed as education for employment, which reduces much of education's potential liberating and transformational effects. With regard to the environment specifically, the unquestioning of the current education paradigm results in the continued prioritization of economic growth over the environment (Komatsu et al., 2020 ). For example, there is no obvious recognition of the fact that countries having “better” education also have more detrimental impacts on climate change, or the fact that the world is the “most educated it has ever been and yet the nearest to environmental breakdown” (Komatsu and Rappleye, 2018 , p. 7), which suggests that there is a deep and fundamental flaw in the values embedded in existing educational model that SDG 4 is attempting to expand. Yet there is little attempt to interrogate and critically reconsider the existing model of education, and there is only anemic attempts to explore whether all education consistently support sustainable development (Komatsu and Rappleye, 2018 ). As Sterling (2015)  observes, while Goal 4 emphasizes education in terms of its potential socio-economic benefits, there is no recognition that education through awareness raising, training and capacity-building can help protect environmental quality and lead to wiser resource use. In fact, SDG 4 is seen by some as paying mere lip service to education for sustainable development by lumping it together with so many other topics in Target 4.7 that the focus on education for the environment is diluted (Sayed and Moriarty, 2020 , p. 2121). Therefore, while SDG 4 was supposed to be a core clarion call for education to play crucial role in environmental preservation, its advent has not changed education's “business as usual” approach and is therefore still in need of radical transformation itself for greater impact on sustainability. As explored earlier, it is welcomed that SDG 4 is more ambitious than the education MDGs by expanding its focus on educational levels and framing quality education beyond mere access to schooling. However, even with these expansions to the educational agenda, “the concept of quality education and learning is narrowed and reduced in instrumental ways that reduce its potential reach and impact” (Sayed and Moriarty, 2020 , p. 212). For example, definitions of indicators of quality seem more technicist and narrow and not sufficiently clear on what constitutes quality learning, particularly in defining how education should change behavior (that is, education's affective component). There seems to be some acknowledgment of this concern, as in 2019, UNESCO (2019)  conducted a study that “examined whether, and to what extent, three learning dimensions,” that is the cognitive, social and emotional and behavioral, “are prioritized in commitments to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and Global Citizenship Education (GCED) learning in pre-primary (PPE), primary (PE), lower secondary (LSE) and upper secondary (USE) education in a selection of countries from UNESCO's five regions of the world” (p. 7). The study found that “the relative emphasis on each of the three interrelated learning dimensions varies across education levels and across countries, reflecting specific contexts, systems, and needs,” leaving UNESCO to encourage stakeholders to “pay more attention to [these] three learning dimensions” (p. 9). Critics also add that there is a distinct quantitative bias of SDG 4 indicators and this advantages those characteristics of educational quality that are readily amenable to quantitative measurement; qualitative indicators that are more reflective of changed behaviors, perceptions, and people's experiences and emotive responses to education are suppressed. Wulff (2020)  also highlights the “narrow implementation of the Broad Commitment of Quality” (p. 21) by the disproportionate focus on measuring learning outcomes primarily in the areas of literacy and numeracy while other subjects and dimensions of quality are marginalized. Further, the narrow universal focus on quality as measurement of numeracy and literacy, along with its attendant narrow set of data points, pushes education “toward global convergence and denies the importance of contextually relevant education” (Wulff, 2020 , p. 22). As a result, what is considered valuable knowledge becomes standardized regardless of context, and learning is narrowed and reduced to market-productive human capital foci. Some observers have also raised SDG 4's non-engagement with the issue of language of instruction as a problematic education quality issue that should have been addressed by the Goal 4 (Milligan et al., 2020 ). Milligan et al. (2020) , for example, cite voluminous research showing that language of instruction is central to learning and therefore a key component of educational equity, given that “so many children around the world learn in a dominant language, often which is not their own for example colonial language or non-indigenous language” (p. 120). An important component of SDG 4, like all the other Goals, is verification of their progress and effects through monitoring and evaluation and, as such, the Goals are heavily dependent on data collection. Some characterize this process as “standardization” and “datafication” of education that have now found their way into SDG 4 based on the assumptions that processes of teaching and learning can be standardized and used to measure the performance of students, teachers and overall education systems, regardless of context (Wulff, 2020 ; Sellar and Hogan, 2019 ). In addition to this reductive use of data, data collection can be expensive and this has increasingly become a critical challenge, especially for developing regions with limited data gathering infrastructure and tradition (Johnstone et al., 2020 ). This has the potential to pull already limited resources from important educational areas in order to satisfy data gathering requirement of the SDG 4, which may not necessarily advance key educational and equity goals. In fact, UNESCO (2020)  in its Global Education Monitoring Report 2020  cites problems of data collection and note that many countries still struggle to collect meaningful data, especially for inclusion of educationally disadvantaged populations. SDG 4's preoccupation with certain types of standardized data also invites a gendered critique. Durrani and Halai (2020) , for instance, note that SDG 4's reliance on and preoccupation with measurement and international ranking “often misses the most important aspects of gender equality because those aspects cannot be quantified” (p. 94). Thus, the Education SDG is said to “reproduce colonial gender hierarchies, including gender binaries” where the most marginalized are often the most invisible social groups due to the nature of standardization and datafication of education (Durrani and Halai, 2020 , p. 93). Another consequential component of SDG 4, also related to monitoring and evaluation and accountability, is how the Goal will be financed. One irony that some have cited is that even though SDG 4 is much broader and more ambitious than the Education MDGs, commitment to resourcing the former has gone down from the recommended 6% of GDP to a more flexible range of 4–6% and from 20% of national budget to 15–20% (Archer and Muntasim, 2020 ; Wulff, 2020 ). However, it is estimated that at least $39 billion of aid was needed annually to achieve just some of the main SDG 4 targets (King, 2016 ). The disappointing outcome of the Financing for Development (FfD) conference in Addis Ababa in 2015 that should have supported the development agenda, including SDG 4, is significant (Brissett, 2018 ; Archer and Muntasim, 2020 ). With the continued and even further diminishing budgets of developing countries, the SDG 4 framework has promoted public-private partnerships (PPP) as a solution to fill the wide financial gap of the education targets. However, scholars and activities are wary of the profit motive and market logic, as well as the reductive and instrumental view of education, that emerge when private interests shape education, and they worry about the privatization forces on equity and equality (Rizvi and Lingard, 2010 ; Wulff, 2020 ; Archer and Muntasim, 2020 ). There is genuine concern that as the market logic influences SDG 4, through such public private partnerships, private interests might “capture public funds to support commercial interests, whose long-term effects could be deeply damaging to quality, equality and the public good” (Draxler, 2020 , p. 168).  Conclusion The SDGs emerged out of a much wider agenda than the MDGs and were more participatory in their development. Education has taken an important place in the SDGs after initial doubts that it would have a designated place in the new global development agenda. Replacing MDG 2 and 3, SDG 4 expanded on these Goals to include equitable access to primary and secondary education, early childhood development and pre-primary education, post-secondary/tertiary education of various forms, job-relevant skills, increased access for people with disabilities and other traditionally marginalized groups, adult literacy education, education for sustainable development, building of physical school facilities, increased scholarship abroad for higher education for students in low income countries, and increased teacher supply. The prospects of SDG 4 rest on its claim of a rights-based approach, which underpins its more inclusive tone compared to the Education MDGs. SDG 4, therefore includes its widened capacity as a resource for lobbying and advocacy for education, and the adoption of a more elongated interpretation of education with a focus on lifelong learning to tertiary educational levels. But particularly important is the greater focus on quality education beyond mere access and enrollment, as well as its heightened, more deliberate focus on historically marginalized groups, including people with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situation, among others. However, SDG 4's rights-based approach is juxtaposed with an instrumentalist approach where education, fundamentally, is built to support a particular economic model. As such, SDG 4 suffers from an internal struggle between a broader rights-based conceptualization and the instrumentalist approach to education. This latter approach generates limitations of SDG 4 that are similar to problems associated with the Western modernist development model of universalism and inequitable power relations, as well the challenge of global public policy making in a context of sovereign nations and multiple interests. Among the challenges emerging from SDG 4 in this context are the tensions between the SDG 4 Targets and those in countries and regions. However, most problematic are the fundamental values that some see embedded in SDG 4, particularly its commitment to the existing model of education that has historically supported what many believe to be a flawed economic system that has exploited people, societies and the environment. Thus, another central critique of SDG 4 is the lip service paid to education for the environment; many observers have noted the limited systemic integration of types of knowledge and learning that truly raise the natural world above its existing position of a consumable resource. And this critique is also tied to the degree to which some see SDG 4 as adhering to its rhetoric of quality education; here, questions are raised about how quality education is assessed due to the Goal's bias toward standardization and datafication which limit the emergence of educational issues that are qualitatively important but not amenable to easy quantification. These concerns are also extended to the extensive monitoring and evaluation necessary for SDG 4 and the associated costs. These above challenges are capstoned by the lack of financing for the SDG 4. However, many laud these new global development Goals. And even with their challenges, there is still hope and, some would say, potential for the Education SDG 4 to serve and advance Global Citizenship and transform our world.   References Ali, 2016 S.
