Therefore, this paper aims to analyze circularity indicators that can assess the three pillars of sustainability at the nano and micro levels to indicate gaps. We propose a three-step method for eight circular indicators aligned with sustainability: characterization by Sources, Type, Cycles, CE Strategy, Business Strategy, Methodology, and Multiple lifecycles; analysis based on three CE principles and by the direct contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The main results establish a scarcity connection of indicators with preserving and enhancing natural capital and SDGs 6 and 15; none address the CE strategies Refuse and Rethink, and one focuses on Repurpose.

Keywords Circularity indicators  Resources management  Circular economy principles  Nano level  Micro level, and sustainability   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.      1 Introduction The organizational model for producing goods and services in society is predominantly linear: resources are extracted, go through the production process, are used by society, and then discarded, ignoring externalities. As a result, we extract more natural resources than the planet can provide, and we waste materials in the production chain, unraveling and in the energy inherent to them. Moreover, in addition to the population growth predicted until 2100, it is estimated that 3 billion people will emerge into the middle class by 2030 and become new consumers (EMF, 2013 ). In this context, the idea of a circular economy (CE) gains space as a way to mitigate the impacts of unidirectional practice, seeking a restorative economic system that is less harmful to the environment (Rocha, 2020 ). Thus, CE implementation principles are increasingly recommended as a convenient solution to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) (Saidani et al., 2019 ). The CE is gaining increasing prominence in research, and indicators are needed to assess the implementation of practices and guide decisions to achieve the model (Pires and Martinho, 2019 ). The indicator was developed to help circularity practices fit their aims, measure progress and performance, and simplify information. Thus, they are managerial and policy-making instruments used to create goals and analyze them or communicate externally about significant issues (Saidani et al., 2019 ). There are indicators capable of measuring different criteria at different circularity levels. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the best use of each indicator and what it is measuring. In addition, there are several indicators, and choosing the most suitable evaluation can be challenging (Saidani et al., 2017 ). As the CE has different definitions (Parchomenko et al., 2019 ), the indicators may not be very explicit in what they intend to measure, generating errors in interpreting the results. However, they are part of an essential role in developing a deeper understanding of the CE concept (Blomsma and Brennan, 2017 ). In addition, there is already a considerable number of indicators, and it can be challenging to find the most suitable evaluation (Saidani et al., 2019 ). Therefore, this paper aims to analyze circular economy (CE) indicators that can assess the three pillars of sustainability as a unit at the nano and micro levels to indicate gaps and ensure the decision-makers choose the ideal circular indicators for their company or product. The analysis findings are used to show the novelty of this work and create a base for companies to identify and adopt the most suited circularity indicator based on the CE strategies and sustainability goals. In this context, our study provides points for categorizing circularity indicators and their characteristics and is also an important contribution to the CE concept. To do so, this article is organized as follows: This first Section shows the introduction and a theoretical background; Section 2  outlines the methodology; Section 3  presents the indicator-related results; Section 4  explores the results related to the indicators' goals and SDGs; Section 5  summarizes the closes the study with the research conclusions. 1.1 Circular economy characteristics CE is a broad concept, but it is possible to define three principles. The first is to preserve and enhance natural capital by controlling finite stocks and balancing the flows of renewable resources. The second is to optimize the productive use of resources by circulating products, components, and materials at the highest level of utility, both technical and biological. Finally, the third consists of stimulating the system's effectiveness by revealing and excluding negative externalities from the beginning (EMF, 2015 ). It was necessary to divide the biological and technical cycles, initially made in the Cradle-to-Cradle approach. This separation is important due to the different treatments for materials both in life and at the end (EMF, 2013 ). Biological components must be designed to enter the biosphere, as they are biodegradable and return value to the environment, while technical components are non-renewable materials and, therefore, should not enter the biosphere. Technical nutrients must be designed to be easily dismantled and to preserve the quality of the material, or improve it, keeping industrial cycles closed (McDonough and Braungart, 2010 ). In addition to the cycle division, CE can work at different levels, such as micro and nano. The micro level focus on a single company. The nano level derives from the micro and concerns the product or its components. It was relevant to dissociate it from the micro to avoid misunderstandings about its objective and to allow focus on a central CE subject (Saidani et al., 2017 ). The Rs strategy is used to assist in the transition to CE. The Rs strategy may differ in quantity, as with the 9Rs described by Potting et al. (2017) . The Rs are arranged in order of priority, so it is preferable first to have smarter product usage and production, then try to extend the lifespan, and then make a useful material application. For this, there is the possibility of recycling or incineration. Recycling should only be applied when it is necessary to recover the value of the materials, and incineration is the last option since the energy is recovered, but the components can no longer be reused (Potting et al., 2017 ). Strategies are crucial to pursuing the circular model, but other aspects must be considered to achieve it effectively. One of them is the business model since a company must survive the proposed changes in order for it to be viable. Therefore, it is essential to consider the reality of the existing market, the effective cost, and the transition perspectives (Franco et al., 2021 ). In addition, according to Teece (2010) , the business model is more generic than the business strategy, but the strategic analysis is fundamental for designing a competitive and sustainable model.  1.2 Circular economy and life cycle Linear companies and production lead to a scarcity of natural resources, apart from increasing the price and volatility (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013 ). To transition to circular, there are five main fields of action: Take, make, distribute, use and recover (Prieto-Sandoval et al., 2018 ). The process begins with "take," the extraction of natural resources, followed by "make," the production of goods and services, and "distribution," when the product is delivered to the consumer. It is relevant to highlight that most indicators do not cover this part of the cycle (de Oliveira et al., 2021 ). After that, the product is "used," and the user can play an essential role in the product development, influence the market demand and extend the product's lifespan or its parts (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al., 2010 ; Potting et al., 2017 ). At last, after the product's functional life ends, it goes to "recovery" to preserve the resources (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013 ) It is interesting to observe that "make" is the most critical field because it has implications for all the other stages. The sustainable design of the production could extend the lifecycle and influence recovery, up-cycling, and down-cycling (Prieto-Sandoval et al., 2018 ). During manufacturing, the producer can use smarter circularity strategies, Refuse, Rethink and Reduce, preserving even more natural resources (Potting et al., 2017 ). For example, for easily outdated technology products, such as smartphones, it is a good choice to design them with the modularity of their components, to upgrade only some parts of it, or use it in other generations (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013 ). Moreover, a design should prioritize multiple returns and redistribution and optimize recovery through the equilibrium of the design strategies and EoL options (Asif et al., 2021 ). Therefore, multiple lifecycles are addressed by a novel concept that proposes the notion of predefined lifecycles (Asif et al., 2021 ). After each designed lifecycle, the product is returned to companies to return to the original performance specifications or upgrade to new specifications (Asif et al., 2021 ).  1.3 Circular economy and sustainable development According to the CE definition proposed by Kirchherr et al. (2017) , the CE goal is to achieve sustainable development (SD), and circularity should be simultaneously sustainable for the environment, economy, and society (Corona et al., 2019 ). In addition, other authors also relate CE to SD. Li (2012)  proposes that CE is an economic model that wants environmental protection, prevents pollution, and seeks SD. Franco et al. (2021)  also state that circularity aims to support organizations in making strategic decisions regarding sustainability. Thus, CE and SD are related and have similar goals. Among the similarities is the service to the triple bottom line, and the differences are the presence of technical and biological cycles and the end-of-life (EoL) concept present in the CE (Tiossi et al., 2018). Sustainability does not include several CE aspects, but CE is supported and based on sustainability (Awuah and Booth, 2014 ). In addition, according to Tiossi et al. (2017) , CE is an SD strategy, a tool that "will help companies to achieve what is proposed by the sustainability tripod." Unlike CE, sustainability does not have defined principles. However, in 2015, the UN established the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It contains seventeen goals and targets for the coming years, known as the SDGs. For Fassio and Tecco (2019) , greater efficiency in production systems cannot be enough to achieve a production and consumption model that can be defined as sustainable unless it is combined with socioeconomic and environmental considerations within the proposal portrayed by the SDGs. According to Schroeder et al. (2019) , at nano, micro, and meso  levels, circularity practices can contribute to some SDGs, and those that have a direct contribution to CE are SDGs 6, 7, 8, 12, and 15, which refer to clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, responsible consumption and production, and life on land, respectively. Moreover, Panchal et al. (2021)  relate circularity indicators of all levels to SDGs 6, 7, 8, 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and 12. Fatimah et al. (2020)  connect CE with SDGs 6, 8, 12, and 13 (climate action). However, the research focuses on waste management, considering the EoL/recovery of the product in a lifecycle thinking. Belmonte-Ureña et al. (2021)  indicate that the most found SDGs in CE research at all CE levels are 6, 9, 11, 12, and 15. When SDGs are achieved, environmental aspects are improved, and economic and social aspects are enhanced (Fatimah et al., 2020 ). However, they tend to have one strongest pillar. According to Rockström and Sukhdev (2016) , SDGs 6, 13, and 15 are focused on the environment; SDG 7 and 11 is related to society; and SDGs 8, 9, and 12 address the economy.   2 Materials and methods This study proposes an analysis and comparison of indicators at the nano and micro levels to assist their use and ensure that they meet the CE principles and the SDGs. The indicators encompass the three pillars of sustainability together as a unit. Therefore, any indicator that only assesses one or two pillars together are out of scope and excluded from this research. Focusing on the three pillars as a whole, we based our research on two papers that analyzed the alignment between sustainability and circular economy indicators (Kristensen and Mosgaard, 2020 ; de Oliveira et al., 2021 ) for nano and micro levels. The first paper analyzed thirty indicators, while the second analyzed fifty-eight. The two reached similar conclusions, including that few indicators align with sustainability (social, economic, and environmental pillars). Kristensen & Mosgaard (2020)  research resulted in three indicators aligned with our proposal, all contemplated in de Oliveira et al. (2021)  results. Thus, the indicators were selected from de Oliveira et al. (2021)  results. The eight chosen indicators are listed below:• Sustainability Performance Indicators (SPI) (Mesa et al., 2018 );  • End of Life Best Practice Indicators (BPI) (Jiménez-Rivero and García-Navarro, 2016 );  • Sustainable Circular Index (SCI) (Azevedo et al., 2017 );  • Expended Zero Waste Practice Model (ZWP) (Veleva et al., 2017 );  • Set of Indicators to Assess Sustainability (SIAS) (Golinska et al., 2015 );  • Circular Business Model Set of Indicators based on Sustainability (CBM-IS) (Rossi et al., 2020 );  • Multi-Criteria Evaluation Method of Product-Level Circularity Strategies (MCEM-PLCS) (Alamerew et al., 2020 );  • Product Recovery Multi-Criteria Decision Tool (PR-MCDT) (Alamerew and Brissaud, 2019 ).    The methodology is divided into 3 phases: (1) Indicators categorization, (2) Indicators analysis regarding compliance with the CE principles, (3) Indicators analysis regarding the SDGs. We outline the phases in the following subsections. 2.1 Phase 1: Categorization The first phase consists in categorizing the eight circularity indicators. The eight categories aiming to assist the use of the indicators are summarized in Table 1  . Measuring the progress of the CE means gathering quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative data and compiling them into indicators that provide meaningful information. Thus, the categories were chosen to understand each indicator better and to assist companies in selecting the most suitable one. The source was chosen to acknowledge the origins of the indicators and their development background (Saidani et al., 2019 ). The category Type is to understand the complexity of the indicator. Different Levels require different indicator frameworks (Saidani et al., 2019 ) and Cycles are to comprehend if the focus is on products of service or consumption (Panchal et al., 2021 ). The CE Strategy was selected to analyze the strategies proposed by each indicator for circularity and understand if they work with high or low levels of circularity (Potting et al., 2017 ). Also, it is essential to know if the indicator considers Business Strategy since the business model needs to survive the changes proposed by the indicators (Franco, 2021 ). Methodological Approach was added to clarify the usability and complexity of the method that decision-makers may not easily understand in a company context (Kravchenko et al., 2019 ) and, lastly, Multiple Lifecycles because it should be a priority in CE (Asif et al., 2021 ). In order to classify the indicators into categories, it was necessary to delimit some aspects. Thus, in terms of type, single quantitative indicators have one or more quantitative criteria. Analytical guidelines involve qualitative criteria, such as questionnaires, and require the analysis of stakeholders or decision-makers. Furthermore, composite indicator sets present more complex tools in their formation, not limited to an equation, such as the life cycle assessment (LCA). The levels were previously defined by de Oliveira et al. (2021)  as nano, micro, or both. In addition, the indicators were considered to meet the biological or technical cycle based on the adopted circularity practices. If the practices measure solutions such as composting and incineration, the indicator meets the biological cycle, but if it only has techniques such as remanufacturing and recycling, it meets the technical cycle. The CE strategies were identified based on the categories list, except MCEM-PLCS and PR-MCDT. The strategies can vary based on the decision-makers choices. As for business strategy, it was considered that the indicator covers these issues when explained by the author. It is worth mentioning that Potting et al. (2017)  described ten circularity practices. However, some indicators bring different approaches. Furthermore, for the category Multiple Lifecycles, the indicator must have measurement or assessment of the products, components, and materials for the nano level and procedures in the companies for a second or more life of their products for the micro level.  2.2 Phases 2 and 3: CE principles and sustainable development goals In the CE analysis, the EMF (2015)  principles were considered. Nonetheless, these principles can overlap and be interpreted in different ways. Therefore, their relationship with the indicators was delimited. For the first principle, it is understood that natural capital is preserved when the indicator predicts the replacement of finite sources with renewable ones (energy), analyzes the amount of virgin material used, rethinks the material type or the product design to save it, and includes analysis on the water cycle. In the second principle, keeping products and materials in use, it is interpreted that resources are optimized through circularity strategies, such as the 9Rs of Potting et al. (2017) . In the third principle, the indicators that analyzed the amount of waste generated or the circularity strategies efficiency, those that aim at zero waste, or even those that analyzed the greenhouse gasses (GHG) released in the process were considered. For classification, it was considered necessary for the indicator to have at least one of the mentioned relationships under the principle. As for sustainability, the SDGs considered were SDG 6, SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG12, and SDG 15. According to Schroeder et al. (2019) , those are the ones with the more direct contribution, and there is a strong relationship between CE practices and them. Moreover, they are related to the nano and micro levels. Thus, based on the targets directly affected by CE, the indicators should have referred to the following:• SDG 6: Water use reduction or efficiency, Amount of water recovered in the treatment, Employee hygiene conditions;  • SDG 7: Energy use efficiency or cost, Renewable energy compared to fossil fuel, Equipment efficiency;  • SDG 8: Production/productivity efficiency, Research, and development innovation/incentive, CE strategies efficiency, Job creation;  • SDG 12: Energy and resource usage optimization, CE strategies, Waste generation minimization, gasses emission;  • SDG 15: Water use optimization, Raw materials use reduction, Resources from deforestation or deforested areas.      3 Results The eight circularity indicators guided by sustainability were analyzed following the steps explained in Section 2 . The results are shown in this section. 3.1 Indicators categorization The comparison of indicators is presented in Table 2  . The indicators source was not presented in the table, as they are all of academic origin. As for the level classification, four of the indicators (50%) belong to the micro level and should be used for companies, three (37.5%) at the nano level for products, and the CBM-IS is the only one (12.5%) which can be used for both levels. Regarding the type of indicator, 37.5% are single indicators, 50% are analytical tools, and MCEM-PLCS is the only composite indicators set. More than half of the indicators do not use only quantitative data, which makes them more complex to apply and increases the chance of requiring qualified people. In the classification by cycles, the technical cycle stood out for being present in all indicators, and only the ZWP can also be used for the biological cycle. Even so, only composting is included as a CE strategy. Business strategy is considered by 50% of the indicators. The SCI indicates that it considers business practices. However, it does not measure the market and economic issues. The ZWP is the only one developed based on an already applied system and considers aspects such as money savings, fair market value, resilience, and company competitiveness. In addition, the CBM-IS, MCEM-OLCS, and PR-MCDT also consider aspects such as competitive advantage, profitability, or consumption model. Even if they are indicators related to sustainability, it is already expected that economic issues will be measured in some way. Not considering that business strategy means a greater risk of the indicators not being viable in practice because it is necessary to consider market issues. As for the methodology, notewise the diversity of methods used and that there are two multi-criteria methods, the MCEM-OLCS and the PR-MCDT. The Gray Decision Making of SIAS also stands out, as it does not need an extensive database, which can be a differential to facilitate the use of the indicator and, consequently, the transition to CE. None of the indicators present a measurement or assessment for multiple lifecycles, even though most mention Reuse, Remanufacture, and Recycle. The indicators' principal focus is the first life cycle of the product and a circular EoL perspective, as the CE strategy showed. The circularity strategies used by the indicators differ, and for comparison purposes, we related them to the strategies proposed by Potting et al. (2017) , as shown in Fig. 1  . Some strategies mentioned are not found in the 9Rs. They are Recondition, Cannibalization, and Renewability. For Rossi et al. (2020) , renewability is related to renewable energy and material from renewable sources (renewable raw material). Recondition returns a satisfactory quality level of the product, almost as a new product, but the "products have gone through more extensive testing and repair than refurbished products" (Alamerew et al., 2020 ). Cannibalization is the recovery of the part from returned products as part of the process of repairing, refurbishing, and remanufacturing (Alamerew and Brissaud, 2019 ; Alamerew et al., 2020 ). With ten different CE strategies, the indicator that includes more strategies is MCEM-PLCS (six CE strategies), CBM-IS observes five CE strategies, and PR-MCDT and ZWP contemplate four strategies each. The SCI is guided by three strategies and SPI by two, and both BPI and SIAS focus only on one strategy. Only CBM-IS and ZWP work with smarter products and manufacture, extend the lifespan of products and their parts, and useful application of materials. Furthermore, there is a prioritization for extending the lifespan of products and carrying out the useful application of materials, primarily through recycling. This strategy is present in seven of the eight indicators, making its prioritization evident. Recycle is the only strategy BPI used to measure the circularity of gypsum, and the product type is justified in its use. Remanufacture is the only SIAS's CE strategy since the indicator is focused on assessing remanufacturing operational excellence as far as sustainability issues are concerned. The PR-MCDT, despite analyzing the cost that can be paid with incineration and landfill in the "product cost," does not present this option among the circularity strategies. No indicator is dedicated only to smarter product use and manufacture. Moreover, none of the indicators focus on Refuse and Rethink.  3.2 Analysis based on CE principles The relationship between the indicators and the three CE principles can be observed in the Venn diagram (Fig. 2  ). It can be seen that 62.5% of the indicators comply with the CE first principle, 100% follow the second CE principle, and 75% with the third. All indicators work with the second CE principle because they have strategies that circulate products, components, or materials. It may be related to the fact that the selected levels are product and company oriented and should have this focus. Only 37.5% of the indicators somehow analyze the three CE principles: SCI, ZWP, and MCEM-PLCS. The SCI measures the virgin material input, product durability, and recycling efficiency. However, it is worth noting that efficiency is not comprehensive, limiting efficiency in the recycling strategy. The ZWP aims zero waste and analyzes externalities such as waste generation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the third principle. In addition, it also includes the first principle for measuring material reduction and materials with renewable stock. The MCEM-PLCS considers different methodologies, one of which is LCA. According to International Standard Organization ISO (2006) , "it is convenient that LCA studies systematically and adequately address the environmental aspects of product systems, from raw material acquisition to final disposal" and that the "scope delimitation must include the types of impact and impact assessment methodology." For these reasons, the MCEM-PLCS meets the three CE principles, but it is important to emphasize that "there is no single method to conduct LCA studies." Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that MCEM-PLCS will always include the three CE principles due to the several methodologies that the decision-maker can choose. The indicators that meet the second and third principles are BPI, SIAS, and PR-MCDT. The BPI meets the third principle by analyzing the rejected gypsum residue, which was sent to the landfill, and concluding that it is possible to minimize the non-recyclable residue through design for deconstruction. SIAS analyzes externalities through energy consumption, waste generation, gas emissions, and materials recovery. The PR-MCDT measures emissions of gasses such as CO2  and SO2  and analyzes EoL impacts. Finally, the two indicators that meet the first and second principles are the SPI and the CBM-IS. The SPI meets the first principle by considering the design of the product, analyzing the type of material, quantity used, and its geometry in order to preserve virgin material, and the CBM-IS analyzes the amount of reduced raw material in the product and the amount of material amount of renewable material used, in addition to measuring the renewable energy used.  3.3 Analysis regarding sustainability Table 3   shows the relationship between the indicators and the SDGs. Moreover, Table 3  presents the SDG's focus on sustainability pillars (Rockström and Sukhdev, 2016 ). From the table, we observe that 100% of the indicators meet SDG 12 since they all have at least some strategies to reduce waste generation. SDG 7, covered by 87.5% of the indicators, refers to Clean and Affordable Energy. The indicators addressed energy regarding its cost, the effectiveness of equipment, the amount used or saved, renewable energy or not. SDG 8, Decent Work and Economic Growth, was identified in 62.5% of the indicators. The SPI, SIAS, and PR-MCDT did not address this SDG as they do not measure issues such as innovation, efficiency, and job creation. Although SIAS addresses issues such as employment harmfulness of the remanufacturing process, it was not possible to relate these points to the selected goals of this SDG. On the other hand, SDG 15 on Life on Earth considered the indicators that measure the raw materials use reduction, water use optimization, and resources from deforested areas, addressed by 62.5%. BPI, SIAS, and PR-MCDT did not focus on reducing the use of raw materials, including water. The least observed SDG was 6 on Drinking Water and Sanitation, measured by only 25% of the indicators, the SCI and the ZWP. Notewise that in addition to being the only ones to meet this SDG, they were also the only ones to meet all the SDGs. The MCEM-PLCS was not considered as it does not directly measure this criterion, although LCA may include water analysis. The same occurs with CBM-IS; it has a sub-indicator, called Renewable raw material, that can address water. Regarding water, the SCI evaluated the amount of water consumed per year in industrial processes, and the ZWP, the amount of water saved or reduced percentage. None of the indicators addressed the wastewater treatment to have the cycle closed, reusing the resource. In addition, any indicators did not address the issue of hygiene and sanitation conditions in the work environment. The SPI is the one that least measured the SDGs. The result is consistent with the fact that, as a sustainability performance, the indicator only measured the linear flow rate for product families, the Potential Reuse, and the Potential Recycling rate. Overall, half of the indicators met the three pillars of sustainability. Three indicators focus on economic and social pillars, and only SPI addresses economic and environmental pillars. The top results are summarized in Fig. 3  . Our findings show that SCI and ZWP, which meet all SDGs, also meet all three principles. This result reinforces the relationship between the CE principles and the SDGs since both seek to preserve natural resources, water, and energy so that the current or future generations are not compromised. Even so, the SCI only presents two circularity strategies, while the ZWP presents five; it aggregates CE macro strategies and the business strategy. Furthermore, the CBM-IS and MCEM-PLCS indicators should also be highlighted, as CBM-IS aggregates CE macro strategies such as ZWP. However, it lacks integration with the third principle. The MCEM-PLCS indicator aggregates most CE strategies and focuses on the three CE principles. Both indicators, CBM-IS and MCEM-PLCS, indirectly assess water (SDG 6).   4 Discussion This section is divided into three sub-sections and aims to answer the paper's goal introduced in Section 1 . 4.1 Circularity indicators have different goals Analyzing the eight circularity indicators, we noticed that some indicators were not easily understandable, agreeing with de Oliveira et al. (2021) . They do not clarify what they measure or how to carry out the measurements. Thus, they do not provide detailed calculation procedures or examples, making their understanding and application difficult. It is clear that when using existing methods and tools, the papers do not go into depth on what will be measured. The difficulty is more significant with MCEM-PLCS because it brings the LCA method, and the EoL impact indicator, among others, without giving details of its operation or criteria to be considered by these methods. The MCEM-PLCS is the only composite indicator set to suggest LCA. This complex method is costly and requires detailed data, resources, and training (Golinska et al., 2015 ). Therefore, not all entrepreneurs can implement this method. Three of the eight indicators are single quantitative indicators, but most of the circularity indicators are multi-focus indicators, which means they consider several CE strategies simultaneously (Jerome et al., 2022 ). In general, the single quantitative indicators capture a minor part of the product/production system and ignore business strategy, while the multi-focus indicators account for the product/production system more comprehensively. For instance, all single quantitative indicators target recycling, while most analytical guidelines and the composite indicator set address several CE strategies. This means that part of the indicators measures a limited part of the product system and thus misses changes occurring outside their scope (Jerome et al., 2022 ). The most common CE strategy is Recycle, which is the focus of the single quantitative indicators and is also addressed by analytical guidelines and the composite indicator set. Most circularity indicators were designed for technical cycles and materials from non-renewable sources. However, the demand for food is increasing worldwide, and agriculture has intense resource use (Rocchi et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the biological cycle could be a perfect field of experimentation for a new way of measuring the CE. The biological cycle can be fertile ground for testing and implementing regenerative, optimization, and loop actions (Fassio and Tecco, 2019 ), with a relevant contribution to SDGs 6, 7, 8, 12, and 15. In the biological cycles, materials can be directly restored to the biosphere. Measure the biological cycle allows CE to be preventative and active in repairing previous damage (Murray et al., 2017 ). Thus, the biological cycle indicators ally with the first CE principle, preserving and enhancing natural capital. What seems clear is the need for greater integration between circularity indicators and the biological cycle within production and consumption cycles, as well as between short and long-term perspectives, that is, between economic growth and environmental and social goals (Fassio and Tecco, 2019 ).  4.2 Different weights for CE strategies The results highlight that the primary CE strategy is Recycling, followed by Reuse and Remanufacture. The results are in line with earlier studies such as Panchal et al., (2021) ; Kirchherr et al., (2017) , and Ghisellini et al., (2016) . The emphasis on Recycle conforms with studies of Ghisellini et al., (2016) , Kristensen and Mosgaard (2020) , Morseletto (2020) , and Jerome et al., (2022) . Recycling is a well-known strategy in waste management, and it was added as a strategy for CE (Kristensen and Mosgaard, 2020 ). However, in CE, recycling represents the outer circle (EMF, 2015 ; Ghisellini et al., 2016 ) as the least sustainable option in CE. Moreover, Morseletto (2020)  concluded that Recycle does not necessarily promote a CE as recycling activities are energy intensive, destroy products' integrity and market value, degrade the quality of materials, and do not help products remain in the economy. Additionally, Recycle has little influence on production and consumption (Potting et al., 2017 ). All indicators have an academic origin and, even so, prioritized strategies of less circularity as Recycle. On the other hand, the indicators show a significant divergence in terms of CE strategies they have in focus and the processes they capture. A first observation is that no one of the selected indicators can monitor the benefits related to all the CE strategies. In particular, none of them can capture Refuse and Rethink. Refuse and Rethink may require a significant change in the product or company; for this reason, Refuse and Rethink are closely connected to design (Morseletto, 2020 ). As predicted by Potting et al., (2017) , Refuse involves "making the product redundant, abandoning its function or offering the same function with a radically different product,"; Refuse can also extend to the use of certain materials or production processes (Morseletto (2020) , and Rethink would involve intensifying the use of the product through sharing or "putting multifunctional products on the market." This CE particular benefit, fostered by policy pressures aiming to discourage planned obsolescence but also supported through eco-design strategies, enabled by effective reverse flow management and highly influenced by the customer's behavior, has been neglected so far in the studies considered (Elia et al., 2017 ). Both CE strategies concern smarter business concepts that promote resource decoupling (Morseletto, 2020 ). This strategy requires a shift towards a 'radical' reinvention of products (Potting et al., 2017 ; Kravchenko et al., 2019 ). That is why Refuse and Rethink is so challenging to measure and evaluate, as it enters into a dilemma that non-circular products and industries will be discontinued, are examples of single-use products, disposable straws, useless secondary packages, or even some products that can be substituted by nonmaterial ones (e.g., digital). Our results presented that only one circularity indicator captured CE strategy Repurpose. Repurpose is the use of discarded products or their parts in a new product with a different function (potting et al., 2017 ). It also denotes reusing a product for an alternative purpose (Morseletto, 2020 ). For Morseletto (2020) , five issues make Repurpose monitoring difficult: (1) comprehensive different products can receive many parts and components in Repurpose; (2) it depends on the creativity of the "repurposer"; (3) small-scale production; (4) repurposing is not connected with the company that produces the product/components; and (5) difficult traceability of the parts. With all these issues, Repurpose indicators are often used in a small proportion. Analyzed indicators provide a good overview of product circularity and possible multiple lifecycles, but they do not enter these measures. In line with Saidani et al., (2017)  results, our results showed that the methods used by the indicators miss specific CE strategies and lack guidance for product designers. It is noteworthy that each CE strategy brings a world of possible measurements, e.g., if the indicator focuses on Reuse in the first lifecycle, it can focus on Remanufacture in the second lifecycle and Recycle in the third lifecycle. Moreover, an established closed-loop flow approach is an enabler of indicators (Aydin and Badurdeen, 2019 ; Hapuwatte et al., 2022 ). Morseletto's (2020)  results showed that multiple lifecycles could lead to trade-offs, synergies, or complementarities. For example, Recycle or Recovery can be minimized using other CE strategies (Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, Refuse, Rethink and Reduce) (Morseletto, 2020 ). Some multiple assessment methods are being developed, such as the Metrics-based life cycle sustainability (Hapuwatte et al., 2022 ) and the Multi-Life Cycle Assessment, based on the LCA, but whose assessments focus mainly on remanufacturing and recycling of products (Suhariyanto et al., 2017 ). From a multiple lifecycle perspective, circular indicators can be used to define a roadmap to implement CE successfully. CE strategies toward sustainability are ambiguously defined (Giampietro, 2019 ), and it is unclear how CE deals with industries that cannot be circular (Belmonte-Ureña et al., 2021 ). The circularity indicators are reflections of that vague relationship.  4.3 SDGs The result shows a relationship between CE principles and the SDGs. In this regard, it has been shown that some circularity indicators are highly correlated with some SDGs. Consequently, if companies and decision-makers followed these indicators, the SDGs could achieve better values. Specifically, measures aimed at SDGs 7, 8, and 12 were central points in the indicators. This result is in line with Belmonte-Ureña et al., (2021)  that CE has a biased focus toward SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12. SDG 7 seeks to ensure the availability of reliable and renewable energy for all. Similarly, the CE encourages the transition to a model based on economic, natural, and social capital supported by renewable energy (EMF, 2015 ). Therefore, most circularity indicators focus on SDG 7. By decoupling society from fossil fuels, the CE endorses the widespread use of energy sources to reduce pollution. Moreover, biological cycle indicators should be part of the SDG 7 focus. By addressing organic waste generation and waste-to-energy practices, such as energy production via biomass, the CE promotes the use of renewable energies (Padilla-Rivera et al., 2019 ). SDG 8 aims to promote economic growth while providing jobs and fair work for all. The importance of measuring CE with a focus on SDG 8 is the prediction that the transition to CE will require workers to be trained efficiently and understand the principles and paradigms of a circular enterprise. Furthermore, the possible emergence of new technologies requires different skills (Kirchherr and Piscicelli, 2019 ), potentially influencing the labor market. SDG 12 may be one of the goals most aligned with CE guidelines. Our results are consistent with Boluk et al., (2019)  and Belmonte-Ureña et al., (2021)  that CE is highly relevant for SDG 12. The CE strategies are valuable assets for SDG 12 (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2020 ), and for Belmonte-Ureña et al., (2021) , their relationship is related to keywords such as "waste management," "resource use," and "supply chain." Moreover, excessive use of resources, energy, and waste generation is minimized by circularity indicators, which indicates a convergence with CE principles of enhancing natural capital, optimizing the productive use of resources by circulating products, components, and materials at the highest level of utility and system effectiveness (EMF, 2015 ). The core of CE and SD is resources. The forest depletion rate is alarming (D'Annunzio et al., 2015 ), which has brought uncertainty to the resources supply. Moreover, future projections present that there will be increasing competition for natural resources, particularly water and land (Sartal et al., 2020 ). These challenges call for an urgent shift from current linear models to circular ones that optimize waste as a resource (first principle) and extend the life of products, parts, and components (second principle) while reducing water and resource consumption. Thus, our research shows the existing gap in circularity indicators related to water and sanitation and life on land (SDG 6 and SDG 15, respectively), even though they appear with a strong link with CE (Schroeder et al., 2019 ; Belmonte-Ureña et al., 2021 ). Moreover, Panchal et al., (2021)  results show that SDG 6 has a strong relation with circularity indicators, but SDG 15, such as our result, has a minor contribution. This result is reinforced when we visualize the CE Principles results, as the preserve and enhance natural capital principle had the lowest representation by the circularity indicators. Water is a finite resource consumed mainly by agriculture and industry, which can be saved, reused, or treated by the consumer. Therefore, water reuse closes the loop between water supply and sanitation and, in addition, provides an alternative water source. In a CE, treated wastewater can replenish degrading water sources, ensure sufficient supplies, and reduce the demand and availability gap (Naidoo et al., 2021 ). Therefore, circularity indicators have to cover both efficient water use and its post-use treatment. There are several possibilities and technologies for water treatment, but they are little applied. Untreated wastewater also contributes to GHG emissions (Naidoo et al., 2021 ). In addition, sanitation prevents waste from being disposed of in water sources, contaminating them (Malar, 2021 ). If well monitored and with new technologies, wastewater can even bring an energy return, helping to achieve Goal 7 (Naidoo et al., 2021 ). This is an indicator of the interdependencies between the SDGs, highlighting the need for greater cooperation across sectors, and is the core of SD (Mensah, 2019 ). Furthermore, to maintain the planet's resources, including water, it is necessary to maintain forests, reduce desertification and reverse land degradation. Therefore, land on life must be considered in circularity indicators to guarantee the basic resources to the production system. SDGs are supposed to be strongly interdependent and should never be treated in isolation. Nonetheless, there is a lack of concreteness of the SDGs, their targets, and indicators (Boluk et al., 2019 ; Belmonte-Ureña et al., 2021 ). Therefore, even for CE implementation, it is not easy to establish the corresponding SDGs. Moreover, Sustainable Development Agenda proposes a collaboration between states, businesses, experts, and civic society (Belmonte-Ureña et al., 2021 ). However, based on our results, the CE perspective is framed to appeal to businesses.   5 Conclusions The present research allows the different combinations of the configuration of circular solutions to be exploited in various business processes. Thus, this classification sought to improve the choice of circularity indicators related to sustainability and ensure that they present what they proposed. The analysis and comparison of the indicators were carried out and related to the CE principles and the SDGs. The circularity indicators SCI and ZWP meet all SDGs and the CE three principles. In addition, we concluded that both indicators are the ones that comply with what is proposed. However, ZWP demonstrates the more significant potential for use and feasibility of an application also related to CE strategies. Moreover, the study addresses the following research gaps:• Lack of connection of circularity indicators with SDG 6 and SDG 15;  • Only three indicators encompass the three CE principles;  • The first principle (preserve and enhance natural capital) is the least assimilated by the indicators.    The first CE principle is evaluated by the smallest number of indicators, which seems to show a relationship between the CE principles and the SDGs since SDGs 6 and 15, linked to preserving and enhancing natural capital, are the least assessed. Furthermore, SDG 12 and the second CE principle are already consolidated among them.• None of the circularity indicators addresses the CE strategies Refuse and Rethink;  • Only one indicator focuses on Repurpose.    Refuse and Rethink may require a significant change in design, and they question non-circular products and industries. Furthermore, Repurpose happens on a small scale and is difficult to trace. All indicators present circularity strategies. However, there was a greater focus on EoL, especially recycling. Recycling is important in evaluating the CE transition, but it should be considered one of the last resorts. The novelty of the approach presented in this paper is that it enables the implementation of the circularity indicators for sustainability and CE goals. Managers can choose the most desired indicator for the company or product concerning the company's sustainability strategy. The gaps presented in this paper reflect trade-offs among the different objectives. Thus, companies can identify and adopt the most suited circularity indicator based on corporate goals and business strategies. Moreover, the gaps are opportunities for further research and potential approaches for improving the relevance of circularity indicators for sustainability. Some limitations of this research can be pointed out. Firstly, the indicators were extracted directly from the academic literature, covering a small group of CE indicators. Secondly, there was no multiple lifecycles approach on our circularity indicators portfolio. These limitations can be addressed by expanding the search scope to include corporate surveys, and empirical research is necessary to examine the relevance of circularity indicators from our portfolio once the product is running a second or more life. Lastly, we did not focus on sustainability impact assessment based on the CE strategies. Future research may further investigate the differences between the CE strategies based on the sustainability point of view using consolidated methodologies (e.g., Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment) to overcome barriers regarding sustainability performance assessments.
