                  This paper aims to introduce a new sustainable business excellence model, called Knowledge Management Excellence Model 21 (KMEM21), a theoretical framework that combines Knowledge Management and Business Excellence Models (BEMs), proposing an approach applicable to organizations to directly contribute towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The paper through a qualitative-exploratory methodology makes an analysis and benchmarking, emphasizes the integration of Knowledge Management and three specific Business Excellence Models (Management Excellence Model (MEG) from Brazil, Baldrige Excellence Framework, and EFQM). This integration uncovers relationships between organizational concepts associated with Knowledge Management and BEMs, which contributes to new insights in the literature regarding these concepts' interplay. BEMs are presented as tools that can catalyze the power of Knowledge Management towards achieving SDGs. However, it's noted that the existing BEMs might not be adequate, as the goal extends beyond organizational improvement and excellence to encompass sustainable development aligned with SDGs. The article suggests that specific organizational concepts, identified through a literature review and aligned with Knowledge Management and BEMs, can be selected as indicators associated with the constructed KMEM21 and the SDGs. These indicators are intended to form a bridge between the new model and the SDGs. However, given the comprehensive nature of the theory, model development, application, result acquisition, and analysis, the article's primary contribution will be in its focus on elaborating the instrument and technique, demonstrating the creation of a theoretical framework for the SDGs. Future works will showcase the application of the proposed KMEM21 method in five Brazilian organizations, members of Global Compact, to compare the achieved objectives and the results obtained with the organizations' performance and their sustainability reports.

They are closely integrated into the multi-year strategy of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) to promote awareness and corporate action in support of achieving the goals by 2030 (Edgeman, 2019). This includes a declaration of the 17 SDGs and 169 other targets, along with a section on monitoring and review mechanisms, means of implementation, and global partnerships (Caiado et al., 2018).Furthermore, the article highlights fresh components that enhance the applicability and utility of KMEM21 as a model for organizations striving to attain excellence in quality and sustainability, with a primary focus on leveraging Knowledge Management as the foundational support to reach the SDGs. The development of KMEM21 is based on the three previously mentioned BEMs, revealing a common construction among them. This construction was associated with the authors&apos; acquired knowledge to explain the development of KMEM21. Following this reasoning, indicators were derived from the relationship between organizational concepts of KM and BEMs, forming the dimensions of KMEM21. Similarly, an analysis was conducted to relate these dimensions to the goals of each SDG.In 1980, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and the United Nations Environment Program, launched the World Conservation Strategy. This milestone represented the first significant advancement in integrating environmental and developmental concerns into a comprehensive concept of \u201Cconservation\u201D (Mebratu, 1998).Laurett and Mendes (2019) emphasize that achieving sustainable development requires strong leadership, clear strategic direction, human resource development, effective partnerships, and processes. Mohamed et al. (2009) identify four key factors in achieving healthier sustainable development, with knowledge management being the first. Although literature lacks a defined set of aspects supporting the relationship between KM and sustainability, Arduini et al. (2023) identify vision, strategy, action plan, knowledge processes, organizational structure, organizational effectiveness, and IT infrastructure as fundamental to the KM-sustainability relationship.The methodology of each of the three BEMs stands out for its uniqueness, presenting a distinct approach for each model that lacks parallels in the literature. The development of these models is based on the studies conducted by the institutions that sponsor and implement them (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for Malcolm Baldrige, EuropeanFoundation for Quality Management (EFQM) for EFQM, and National QualityFoundation (FNQ) for MEG). Each model has its own philosophy and keeps its development process internal, with only the final model being made public. For this reason, few sources offer insights into their development, and the closest sources of information are the websites and guides provided by these institutions.Furthermore, existing BEMs, along with their associated quality awards, can serve as motivational tools for organizations and employees to reach established goals. By adapting these models to incorporate sustainability and align with the SDGs, organizations can gain recognition for their contributions to sustainable development. BEMs, when integrated with sustainability goals, enhance the likelihood of successful goal attainment, promoting awareness and commitment to the 2030 Agenda.Funding: This work was financed in part by

Handling Editor: Cecilia Maria Villas Bôas de Almeida This paper aims to introduce a new sustainable business excellence model, called Knowledge Management Excellence Model 21 (KMEM21), a theoretical framework that combines Knowledge Management and Business Excellence Models (BEMs), proposing an approach applicable to organizations to directly contribute towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The paper through a qualitative-exploratory methodology makes an analysis and benchmarking, emphasizes the integration of Knowledge Management and three specific Business Excellence Models (Management Excellence Model (MEG) from Brazil, Baldrige Excellence Framework, and EFQM). This integration uncovers relationships between organizational concepts associated with Knowledge Management and BEMs, which contributes to new insights in the literature regarding these concepts' interplay. BEMs are presented as tools that can catalyze the power of Knowledge Management towards achieving SDGs. However, it's noted that the existing BEMs might not be adequate, as the goal extends beyond organizational improvement and excellence to encompass sustainable development aligned with SDGs. The article suggests that specific organizational concepts, identified through a literature review and aligned with Knowledge Management and BEMs, can be selected as indicators associated with the constructed KMEM21 and the SDGs. These indicators are intended to form a bridge between the new model and the SDGs. However, given the comprehensive nature of the theory, model development, application, result acquisition, and analysis, the article's primary contribution will be in its focus on elaborating the instrument and technique, demonstrating the creation of a theoretical framework for the SDGs. Future works will showcase the application of the proposed KMEM21 method in five Brazilian organizations, members of Global Compact, to compare the achieved objectives and the results obtained with the organizations' performance and their sustainability reports.

However, there is no consensus on when the concept was first used or how it originated. Mebratu's work (1998) takes a detailed journey to provide a historical and conceptual review of sustainability and sustainable development. The author notes that “the report, Our Common Future, published by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in 1987, is considered the starting point for most current discussions on the concept of sustainable development.” However, Mebratu (1998)  also suggests that the evolution of the concept may have originated from traditions and religious beliefs, through economic and political theories, to the critique of the model adopted by industrialized countries at that time. With the evolution of SD, the concept was solidified during the 42nd United Nations Meeting in 1987 by the WCED, led by Gro Harlem Brundtland, now known as the Brundtland Commission (Mebratu, 1998 ; Ferreira, 2018 ). In their report titled “Our Common Future,” also referred to as the Brundtland Report, the commission outlined the principle that “development must be carefully planned to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED, 1987 ; Caiado et al., 2018 ). The concept emphasizes the need to balance resource extraction and environmental preservation to ensure the continuous supply of essential resources without sacrificing the well-being of future generations. It underscores the importance of harmonizing immediate development needs with the imperative to protect a thriving environment for the benefit of both current and future generations (Colombo, 2001 ). To contribute to the global pursuit of sustainable development, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emerge, building on the foundation of the Millennium Development Goals. The SDGs establish specific parameters and targets, providing a reference for the international community to achieve sustainable development in alignment with a new agenda (Ferreira, 2018 ; Fang et al., 2023 ). The SDGs are defined through a series of measurable targets, requiring substantial cooperation and global effort at various levels for monitoring (Caiado et al., 2018 ). They are closely integrated into the multi-year strategy of the United Nations  Global Compact (UNGC) to promote awareness and corporate action in support of achieving the goals by 2030 (Edgeman, 2019 ). This includes a declaration of the 17 SDGs and 169 other targets, along with a section on monitoring and review mechanisms, means of implementation, and global partnerships (Caiado et al., 2018 ). On the quality and excellence front, we have the Business Excellence Models (BEMs), which represent an integrated set of established business practices aimed at enhancing organizational performance in various contexts (Gloet and Samson, 2017 ). BEMs are intrinsically linked to best practice principles, incorporating Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma methodologies, and process improvements, among other approaches (Gloet and Samson, 2017 ). Despite the relatively limited formal emphasis on social and environmental sustainability, many organizations have reaped substantial benefits by rigorously adopting “excellence models” (Edgeman, 2019 ). Among the most well-known are the Deming Prize, the Shingo Prize, the EFQM Excellence Award, the Baldrige Performance Excellence National Award, and the Best Management Award®, among others. These benefits can extend to a 77% increase in organizational profits within 5 years of implementing BEMs, according to Dahlgaard et al. (2013) . Additionally, the Knowledge Era refers to a set of transformations in economic, social, technological, and organizational realms, establishing a new socio-technical-economic pattern. In this context, information and knowledge play strategic roles, leading to significant changes in the dynamics, relationships, and content of work (Escrivão et al., 2011 ). In this era, Knowledge Management (KM) emerges as a relevant concept. Knowledge management encompasses a diverse field of study with applications in both practice and theory, considered one of the most valuable resources for companies. This process establishes itself as a powerful competitive advantage resulting from commitment and continuous improvement efforts (Yusr et al., 2017 ). The literature reveals that knowledge is an intangible entity, making it challenging for many organizations to see clear business outcomes in relation to knowledge management processes and activities, despite the relevance of this aspect for various companies (Ahmed and Elhag, 2017 ). The benefits of KM are directly linked to value creation processes, leading to more well-structured decision-making, increased productivity, deeper information sharing, and direct relationships with customers (Arduini et al., 2023 ), becoming one of the most critical elements for economic growth, not merely as a fundamental asset in companies (Beijerse, 1999 ). In addition, the literature presents various connections between the mentioned concepts. Regarding the relationship between organizations and sustainability, Edgeman (2019)  discusses that in the attempt to translate the definition of SD from the Brundtland Report and operationalize it in companies, the definition proposed by Dyllick and Hockerts emerges as “meeting the needs of a firm's direct and indirect stakeholders without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well.” From a macroeconomic perspective, an economic model grounded in the concept of SD is based on harmonious and conscious relationships between economic growth, environmental protection, and quality of life (Jasiulewicz-Kaczmarek, 2015 ). In the business context, SD takes the form of strategic tools that address both the current needs of the company and its stakeholders, as well as the preservation of human and environmental potential essential for the future (Jasiulewicz-Kaczmarek, 2015 ). It contributes to social goals, strengthens competitive advantage, becomes an essential component of social responsibility, and integrates with the pillars of organizational culture, transparency, and risk management (Paranitharan et al., 2017 ). In this scenario, organizations are focusing their efforts not only on economic benefits but also addressing environmental issues, emphasizing corporate sustainability (Shahzad et al., 2020 ). The SDGs explicitly call on companies to employ their creativity and innovation in overcoming the challenges of sustainable development. By establishing a global agenda for societal progress, the SDGs offer leading companies the opportunity to demonstrate how their operations contribute to sustainable development. This involves minimizing negative impacts and maximizing positive impacts on both people and the planet (United Nations, 2015 ). Regarding the relationship between Business Excellence Models and SD, Edgeman (2019)  evaluates business excellence models as relatively lacking in terms of social and environmental sustainability. However, the research by Politis and Grigoroudis (2022)  highlights the scarcity of studies exploring how Business Excellence Models contribute to internal sustainability and connect with existing sustainable initiatives. On the other hand, the literature highlights strong connections between Knowledge Management and BEMs, as well as between KM and Sustainable Development. Davenport and Prusak (2000)  suggest that a common approach to initiate KM implementation is to anchor it in the company's quality or reengineering efforts. This involves gathering and leveraging best practices along with efficient methods to execute internal or external processes. Interconnected approaches like TQM and ISO standards also relate to knowledge transfer and management. Ahmed and Elhag (2017)  further note that the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM), for example, has specific requirements for implementing knowledge management. Espín et al. (2023)  emphasizes the relationship between EFQM and KM, indicating that the European model provides a suitable framework for organizational KM. Additionally, there are indications that KM can coexist with quality management (including excellence models) as they share key success factors, such as human resources, leadership, stakeholder approach, and process-based management (Espín et al., 2023 ). Arduini et al. (2023)  point out that one of the most widespread trends in business management is the emphasis on sustainability, both as an essential element of corporate knowledge and for overall strategies. They indicate that the impact of sustainability on corporate strategy has changed drastically. The research conducted by Mohamed et al. (2009)  confirms a strong consensus that knowledge is a fundamental foundation for sustainable development. In addition, according to Shahzad et al. (2020) , organizations are actively seeking to adopt new and effective knowledge management strategies to achieve sustainable objectives. Fonseca et al. (2022)  emphasize that the relationship between sustainability and knowledge management is fundamentally associated with the ability to integrate and systematize strategic actions in the use of information and knowledge, aiming to enhance the decision-making process. It is concluded that the concepts of sustainable development, including the Sustainable Development Goals, Business Excellence Models, and Knowledge Management, are interconnected concepts. Moreover, the literature strongly argues that the integral combination of these concepts can provide an effective response within organizations to move towards a solid and healthy sustainable development, achieving the SDGs. This involves using quality and organizational excellence tools like BEMs to shape the knowledge management structure and create sustainable and organizational competitive advantages. With the definition of these concepts and their relationships in mind, it is worth noting the observations from Gloet and Samson (2017) . Despite a vast body of literature suggesting the potential of business or management excellence models in improving market performance through knowledge and intellectual capital management in knowledge-based organizations, there are few studies examining the potential of BEMs in forming knowledge management practices to support organizational success towards the SDGs. An attempt to explore the potential indicated by Gloet and Samson (2017)  is reflected in the research conducted by Barrantes-Briceño and Santos (2019) . In their study, the researchers developed the “Knowledge Management Excellence Model” (KMEM), conceived as “an idea to create a model that can be used as an indicator, measure, and tool to disseminate the SDGs to all stakeholders.” The model aims to be utilized by researchers, organizations (or specific professionals such as sustainability coordinators), or even certain government sectors to easily map and formulate a sustainable strategy using knowledge management as support. In this context, this article introduces the KMEM21 (Knowledge Management Excellence Model 21), an innovative model designed to serve as a tool for indicating, measuring, and evaluating organizational progress from a sustainable and organizational perspective. The model aims to facilitate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by addressing new characteristics, conducting a comprehensive analysis, reevaluating and rectifying existing gaps, and integrating the content of three recognized business excellence models as benchmarks, Malcolm Baldrige, EFQM, and Brazil's MEG. Furthermore , the article highlights fresh components that enhance the applicability and utility of KMEM21 as a model for organizations striving to attain excellence in quality and sustainability, with a primary focus on leveraging Knowledge Management as the foundational support to reach the SDGs. The development of KMEM21 is based on the three previously mentioned BEMs, revealing a common construction among them. This construction was associated with the authors' acquired knowledge to explain the development of KMEM21. Following this reasoning, indicators were derived from the relationship between organizational concepts of KM and BEMs, forming the dimensions of KMEM21. Similarly, an analysis was conducted to relate these dimensions to the goals of each SDG. As a result, KMEM21 will be developed based on the analysis and benchmarking of the studied BEMs. It will be composed of indicators that establish a connection between KM and BEMs. These indicators will serve as a bridge to the SDGs, as any relationship with the targets of each objective would enable a connection between both theoretical fields. For this, the following research objectives are addressed:RO1: Explore the relationships outlined in the literature among organizations, Sustainable Development, Sustainable Development Goals, Business Excellence Models, and Knowledge Management.  RO2: Review similar studies and identify gaps in the existing literature regarding the integration of the three core concepts (SD, BEMs, and KM).  RO3: Conduct a literature review of organizational concepts linking Knowledge Management to Business Excellence Models to identify potential indicators.  RO4: Analyze the three Business Excellence Models and benchmark them against the proposed model.  RO5: Introduce the proposed model, KMEM21, along with its conceptual construction.  RO6: Highlight the correlation between the proposed model and the Sustainable Development Goals.    Three key components were identified in the studied Business Excellence Models (BEMs): 1- an aesthetic model with a distinct visual identity along with its dimensions or criteria, 2- a questionnaire applied to organizations (sometimes self-administered), and 3- a scorecard assigning scores to responses based on the applied model. In some cases, this scoring system is based on a PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle with percentage weights, such as in Brazil's MEG (FNQ, 2017 ), or employs specific tools, like EFQM's RADAR (EFQM, 2019 ), or follows an orientation for process and results classification with percentage increments in specific cycles, as seen in the Malcolm Baldrige model (NIST, 2020 ). In this context, it was understood that KMEM21 should be built with these same three components: a distinctive aesthetic model, an applicable questionnaire, and a scorecard. The development of these elements was guided by the Hilbert-Schule (2015)  model, which relates and defines methods, instruments, and techniques. KMEM21 was created based on these three components and applied to five Brazilian organizations, members of the Global Compact. The results were then compared with the reports provided by these organizations regarding the fulfillment of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs. The model suggests actions based on Knowledge Management for neglected SDGs (according to KMEM21 scores), strategies in specific sectors (based on model dimensions), and illustrates the degree of contribution to each SDG within the organization. However, due to the extensive nature of the theory, model construction, application, data acquisition, and result analysis, this article's contribution will take an exploratory methodological approach. The aim is to provide greater familiarity with a new problem, making it more explicit (Gerhardt and Silveira, 2009 ), and incorporating some explanatory features by identifying factors contributing to the occurrence of phenomena, connecting ideas, concepts, and theories (Gerhardt and Silveira, 2009 ; Gil, 2017 ). Subsequently, the construction of the instrument and technique will be detailed, showcasing the development of a theoretical framework for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The article also suggests a pathway for other researchers, sustainability coordinators, or those interested in the field to formulate their application method for KMEM21 to measure and assess the achievement of SDGs in organizations. In the future, the authors aim to contribute to the literature by demonstrating the application of the proposed KMEM21 method in the five organizations. They plan to showcase the achieved objectives and results, comparing the organizations' performance and reports with KMEM21 information regarding the measurement of the 2030 Agenda's fulfillment. Additionally, the authors aim to discuss potential implications. The rest of the study is structured as follows. Section 2  deals with the theoretical background of SDGs, KM, BEMs and the relationship between the concepts, which leads to the first two research objectives (RO1; RO2). The third section presents the research methodology, introducing the KMEM21 and explaining how the instrument and technique were constructed, achieving the next three research objectives (RO3; RO4; RO5). Section 4  presents the research results, indicating the best way to apply the KMEM21 and reaching the last research objective (RO6). The fifth section refers to the discussion of the findings. Finally, the sixth section draws the conclusions and describes the implications. Fig. 1   presents this structure.  2 Theoretical background This section presents a review of sustainable development, Sustainable Development Goals, knowledge management and business excellence models, the literature relation between them, also describes the first version of the model proposed, and shows the literature gap found. 2.1 Sustainable development and sustainable development goals Mebratu (1998)  notes that ‘the report, Our Common Future, is taken as a starting point for most current discussions on the concept of sustainable development.’ However, the researcher describes various contexts that led to the evolution and creation of the concept:• Religious Beliefs and Traditions: Mebratu highlights the intriguing duality within religious beliefs and traditions. While considered expressions of nature's voice to humanity, they can be critically analyzed as both agents of environmental degradation and repositories of ecological wisdom. Descriptions of Eastern and Western religions and traditions offer valuable lessons on living in harmony with nature and society, a fundamental principle of the sustainability concept.  • Economic Sphere and the Theory of Limits: Mebratu points out the influence of literature dating back to the first economist, Thomas Robert Malthus (1766–1834), that anticipated growth limits due to resource scarcity. Laying the groundwork for the contemporary concept of sustainable development with the idea of the Malthusian “environmental limit."  • Political Economy – “Small is Beautiful”: Mebratu emphasizes the significance of Ernest F. Schumacher's book “Small is Beautiful” (1979) in the field of political economy. Schumacher strongly criticizes the rapid depletion of natural resources and the corresponding environmental destruction. He introduces the concept of intermediate or appropriate technology, emphasizing the importance of human scale. Mebratu underscores that the concept of appropriate technology and responding to social needs are immediate precursors to sustainable development.    Mebratu (1998)  highlights that the trace of sustainable development can be identified at least as far back as the mid-1960s, when appropriate technology began to be employed to uplift less developed countries. In this context, the UN Conference on Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972 recognized the importance of environmental management and the use of environmental assessment as a management tool. Around this time, a group of 36 European economists and scientists convened to discuss a global and long-term perspective on a set of interconnected global issues. This group, known as the “Club of Rome,” produced a report questioning the economic model adopted by industrialized countries. The report emphasized the need to integrate environmental concerns into economic growth, warning that the industrial society would surpass ecological limits within a few decades if it continued promoting the same economic model of the 1960s and 1970s (Mebratu, 1998 ; Ferreira, 2018 ; Club of Rome, 2023 ). In the same year, 1972, the report “The Limits to Growth,” coordinated by MIT researchers Dennis and Donella Meadows, commissioned by the Club of Rome to addressed complex issues, warned about the limitations of exponential growth in a closed system like Earth, stating that continuous exponential growth of population, food production, industrialization, resource exploitation, and pollution would inevitably lead to system collapse sooner or later. The report challenged the dominant paradigm of unchecked economic growth without considering environmental consequences. It concluded that preventing this scenario would require a collective commitment to control and restrain indiscriminate economic growth, achieving a global balance (Mebratu, 1998 ; Colombo, 2001 ; Club of Rome, 2023 ; Fischer et al., 2023 ). The terminology evolved in the following years, introducing concepts such as “environment and development,” “development without destruction,” and “environmentally healthy development.” In 1978, the term “ecodevelopment” gained prominence in the UN Environmental Program review, marking international recognition of the need to simultaneously consider environmental ideas and development (Mebratu, 1998 ). In 1980, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature and the United Nations  Environment Program, launched the World Conservation Strategy. This milestone represented the first significant advancement in integrating environmental and developmental concerns into a comprehensive concept of “conservation” (Mebratu, 1998 ). The concept of sustainable development was revisited and formalized in 1987 during the 42nd United Nations Meeting led by Gro Harlem Brundtland. In this event, the WCED presented the renowned report “Our Common Future” or “Brundtland Report.” This document solidified the principle that “development must be carefully planned to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED, 1987 ; Caiado et al., 2018 ; Fischer et al., 2023 ). However, a key challenge for sustainability is making the definition operational and, therefore, operationalizing the resolutions, i.e., using the Brundtland Report's definition to guide decisions (Caiado et al., 2018 ). To address this issue, an alternative definition of sustainable development was proposed: “design and operation of human and industrial systems to ensure that humankind's use of natural resources and cycles do not lead to diminished quality of life due either to losses in future economic opportunities or to adverse impacts on social conditions, human health and the environment” (Govindan et al., 2013 ). As a result, multiple definitions and interpretations of SD began to emerge, but the most widely cited and consistent was the one put forward by the Brundtland Commission, ultimately influencing and shaping politics, economics, and science (Jasiulewicz-Kaczmarek, 2015 ). To contribute to the global pursuit of SD, an inclusive and transparent intergovernmental process was established, involving the participation and analysis of high-level panels, such as the Open Working Groups, along with numerous inquiries (Ferreira, 2018 ; Caiado et al., 2018 ). Following the 2012 document “The Future We Want,” the final document “Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” was adopted in September 2015, this document includes a declaration of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals along with 169 targets (Caiado et al., 2018 ). The SDGs emerge to complete the work of the Millennium Development Goals and respond to new challenges, integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental (Ferreira, 2018 ). It is an agenda embraced by 193 countries to guide global progress toward sustainable development until the year 2030 (United Nations, 2015 ; Huan et al., 2021 ; Fischer et al., 2023 ).  2.2 Business excellence models Before delving into the definition of a business excellence model, it's important to establish what business excellence (BE) entails. BE encompasses a set of practices strategically designed to fortify an organization's management systems and processes, fostering improved performance and delivering value to stakeholders. It is the pursuit of excellence in every facet of an organization, encompassing dimensions like leadership, strategy, customer focus, information management, people and processes, and, most importantly, yielding better business results (North and Kumta, 2018 ). Gloet and Samson (2017)  characterize BEMs as a comprehensive array of established organizational practices crafted to enhance business performance in any organization. BEMs are intricately connected to the principles of best practices, TQM, as well as methodologies such as Six Sigma, business and process improvements, among other relevant frameworks. In their research, Sharma and Talwar (2007)  highlight a study by SAI Global, revealing that National Quality Awards in 53 countries draw inspiration from the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and its framework. Additionally, 26 other countries base their awards on the EFQM model. This underscores the significance of examining and integrating the Baldrige Excellence Framework (BEF) and EFQM alongside Brazil's MEG for the development of a new model. Fig. 2   provides a comparative overview of the three models, and a brief explanation of the MEG follows. 2.2.1 Management excellence model (modelo de excelência da Gestão®) The National Quality Award (Prêmio Nacional de Qualidade, PNQ) and the Management Excellence Model (Modelo de Excelência da Gestão®, MEG) originated in Brazil as part of a robust quality movement, generating significant interest across diverse sectors of the business community. The Brazilian award was established in 1990 with the launch of the Brazilian Quality and Productivity Program by the Federal government (Miguel, 2001 ). The MEG, acknowledged as a globally embraced framework, aims to enhance business performance and assess the management maturity of companies. It is organized around “fundamentals of excellence” and “standards of excellence,” encompassing systems thinking, organizational learning, culture and innovation, leadership and constancy of purpose, process orientation and information, future and market vision, value generation, customer knowledge, and market strategy development (FNQ, 2017 ). The MEG diagram (Image 1  ) is based on the Tangram, a seven-piece Chinese puzzle dating back to the 9th century AD. Applied to organizations, this model seeks to reconfigure and reassemble them according to the best way to define their management model. The figure illustrates the interconnection between organizations, perceived as adaptive systems for generating products and information, and their organizational and technological environment, extending to the external environment itself (FNQ, 2017 ).   2.3 Knowledge management The literature provides various definitions for Knowledge Management, but, similar to Sustainable Development, there is no consensus regarding its definition or origin. While a comprehensive review of KM definitions is beyond the scope of this work, the contribution of the various authors studied to this literature review stands out. The relevant points from these authors' definitions or understandings of KM will be presented.• Armistead (1999) : As an emerging discipline, it intertwines academically and pragmatically with others such as philosophy, economics, social sciences, physical sciences, and the application of information and communication technologies.  • Beijerse (1999) : Knowledge Management focuses on a specific aspect of individuals—their knowledge. It aims to achieve organizational goals through strategy-oriented motivation and facilitating workers' knowledge to develop, enhance, and utilize their ability to interpret and give meaning to data and information.  • Handžić (2011) : KM must ensure that the right knowledge reaches the right people at the right time and assist individuals in sharing and putting knowledge into action to enhance organizational performance.  • Pellegrini et al. (2020) : From their literature review, they cluster definitions, highlighting KM as the “handling” of knowledge from its external creation or acquisition to internal utilization and integration within the organization. KM spans disciplines like information science and information management, considering management as a process and integrating KM into top management's strategic decisions.  • Klingenberg and Rothberg (2020) : They compile definitions, including Davenport's (1994) description of KM as “the process of capturing, developing, sharing, and effectively using organizational knowledge.” Additionally, they reference Duhon (1998), Scarbrough, Swan, and Preston (1999), and Alavi and Leidner (2001), emphasizing KM as a discipline promoting an integrated approach to identify, capture, assess, retrieve, and share information assets for organizational learning and performance enhancement.  • Arduini et al. (2023) : They perceive KM as the framework in which a company's knowledge resides and moves, influencing performance improvement, competitive advantage, innovation, shared skills, organizational integration, and continuous improvement. KM should be regarded as a filter determining which information should be used and when it is appropriate to do so.    To align with the concepts of knowledge management presented, it is defined in this article as: Knowledge Management encompasses all activities and processes that involve creating, acquiring, capturing, analyzing, organizing, managing, storing, using, disseminating, transferring, and sharing knowledge and information. The purpose is to optimize and enhance the organization's ability to adapt, grow, and respond effectively to dynamic organizational changes.  2.4 Relationship between concepts 2.4.1 Organizations and sustainable development Companies exert significant influence on the natural environment and society through the design, provision of products and services, production processes, and business models (Jasiulewicz-Kaczmarek, 2015 ). The Brundtland Report played a crucial role in catalyzing global interest in the environment, setting the agenda for governmental and consumer environmental considerations, defining industry and corporate parameters (Aagaard, 2018 ). In the pursuit of globalization, sustainability becomes essential for business and innovation, transitioning from political rhetoric to corporate strategy (Aagaard, 2018 ). Since the 1990s, organizations have incorporated environmental strategies into their business methods as evidence of the role SD can play (Ferreira, 2018 ). Traditionally, supplier evaluation considered criteria such as price, quality, and flexibility. However, sustainability has become crucial for the long-term success of supply chains, with organizations now including environmental, social, and economic concerns in assessing the sustainability performance of their suppliers. This shift is a result of environmental and social initiatives and pressures (Govindan et al., 2013 ). Sustainability is a crucial element across all business areas, playing a vital role in creating strategic value and integrating with organizational strategy. It is a pivotal factor in management decisions and presents challenges in planning and implementation (Arduini et al., 2023 ). This interconnection between sustainability and strategy is particularly evident in manufacturing and services, where sustainability is recognized as a strategy driving economic and social benefits, integrating with approaches like agile manufacturing, lean production, and business process reengineering (Paranitharan et al., 2017 ). The adoption of the SDGs marks a new phase in corporate environmentalism since 2015, representing a shift in conventional business models to address social challenges (Leon, 2014 ; Ferreira, 2018 ; Edgeman, 2019 ). According to Pedersen (2018) , the SDGs, like sustainable development in general, are a gift to businesses, as the economic rewards for incorporating and meeting the SDGs are significantly higher. Research on sustainable businesses and innovations has rapidly grown, reflecting the pursuit of sustainable business development. According to the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, pursuing corporate sustainable development can generate market opportunities of up to $12 trillion annually, creating up to 380 million jobs by 2030 (Pedersen, 2018 ). The path to sustainability begins with waste management, pollution control, and recycling, evolving into a comprehensive approach that includes social responsibility, economic integration, and environmental considerations (Fan and Chang, 2021 ). The World Business Council for Sustainable Development emphasizes that companies must take on three responsibilities—financial, environmental, and social—to achieve balanced sustainability (Fan and Chang, 2021 ). Based on the above, companies face advantages and challenges in embracing SD and the Sustainable Development Goals, playing a crucial role in addressing environmental and social issues. Even when operating in specific business areas, they impact consumption patterns, treatment of natural resources, and the mitigation of injustices and inequalities. Additionally, continuous monitoring of progress towards the SDGs at different levels is crucial, including regional, national, subnational, and organizational levels. This approach empowers countries and organizations to identify critical issues, recognize gaps between nations, and implement targeted policy actions more effectively to achieve the SDGs with precision and impact (Huan et al., 2021 ).  2.4.2 Business excellence models and sustainable development Edgeman (2019)  criticizes the deficiency of business excellence models regarding social and environmental sustainability, proposing a reevaluation of values and criteria to align social and environmental performance with economic and innovation aspects. Politis and Grigoroudis (2022)  emphasize the scarcity of studies on how these models contribute to internal sustainability and connect with existing sustainable initiatives. The implementation of BEMs to assess sustainability generates disagreements regarding their effectiveness in the literature—some advocate for them as the best approach, while others argue that their real promotion lacks clarity (Politis and Grigoroudis, 2022 ). Business excellence models have been debated as vehicles for sustainable development, initially focusing on quality improvement and operational management. However, in recent years, their scope has expanded, justifying their use as tools to assess and enhance sustainability. This is based on various reasons, including how widespread use of BEMs can achieve remarkable levels of organizational performance and the systematic approach they employ to meet the requirements of diverse stakeholders (Politis and Grigoroudis, 2022 ).  2.4.3 Knowledge management and business excellence models Knowledge Management is a diverse field with practical and theoretical applications, considered one of the most critical resources for businesses. Yusr et al. (2017)  highlight that through KM, organizations can enhance competitiveness and efficiency, representing a powerful competitive advantage resulting from continuous improvement efforts. It is an unlimited resource, growing as it is utilized (Davenport and Prusak, 2000 ). Currently, companies view KM as a human capital asset, where employees make their knowledge explicit for the organization using available communication infrastructure and tools. The focus is on managing this knowledge in activities that add value and meaning to the company (Mijangos and Manzo, 2012 ). Loon (2019)  emphasizes that KM is studied in various contexts, such as its role in business performance, mediating organizational culture, structure, strategy, organizational effectiveness, and transformative innovation (elements associated with Business Excellence Models). Hossain et al. (2022)  assert that the effects of KM as a mediating component in the relationship between corporate sustainability, organizational culture, social capital, and leadership are statistically significant. KM is crucial for organizational success, requiring strategies to cultivate, nurture, and leverage knowledge at individual, group, and organizational levels (Handžić, 2011 ). To effectively integrate KM into business, it's necessary to connect with various aspects of organizational management and identify components driving knowledge management (Tuamsuk et al., 2013 ).  2.4.4 Knowledge management and sustainable development Sustainability, according to WCED (1987) , requires equitable access to resources long before reaching their ultimate limits, emphasizing the importance of reorienting technological efforts and innovation alongside knowledge accumulation. Arduini et al. (2023)  emphasize that corporate management highlights sustainability as an essential element of corporate knowledge and strategies, reflecting a drastic shift in the impact of sustainability on corporate strategy. Research, such as that conducted by Mohamed et al. (2009) , asserts that knowledge is the fundamental foundation for sustainable development. As sustainability becomes a key factor in the pursuit of long-term value, companies, by integrating sustainability into their strategies, seek to mitigate uncertainties and directly influence KM (Arduini et al., 2023 ). The relationship between KM and sustainability is evident in organizational strategies, exemplified by Broman and Robèrt's Framework of Strategic Sustainability Development published in 2017 (Arduini et al., 2023 ). Shahzad et al. (2020)  claim that knowledge resources and capabilities are ‘building blocks' for companies to innovate sustainably. Identifying knowledge needs and demands is crucial to effectively support organizations on their sustainability journey, however, this remains a gap in current Knowledge Management approaches (Klingenberg and Rothberg, 2020 ). The interaction between KM and sustainability brings advantages, such as a positive shift in corporate attitudes (Arduini et al., 2023 ) and positive impacts on green innovation (Shahzad et al., 2020 ). However, Klingenberg and Rothberg (2020)  research concludes that learning how to acquire knowledge about sustainability is essential, suggesting that existing KM structures may be insufficient. Mohamed et al. (2009)  justify that in SD, as in other knowledge-intensive fields, mobilizing knowledge without integrated communication and information technologies is more challenging. Arduini et al. (2023)  emphasize the importance of initiating sustainability programs by mobilizing knowledge within organizations, pointing to significant research on the subject. These efforts reflect the messages of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, emphasizing that achieving SD depends on the storage and sharing of knowledge (Arduini et al., 2023 ). KM is recognized as a crucial contribution to sustainable development, although still not well understood (Arduini et al., 2023 ). Scientists are urged to strengthen the link between sustainability and KM through effective indicators and structures, enabling organizations to use KM to disseminate best practices and information about sustainability (Arduini et al., 2023 ). In pursuit of corporate sustainability, organizations turn to KM techniques, even in the face of knowledge accumulation and technology development (Hossain et al., 2022 ). In compliance with SD principles, various organizations adopt approaches that facilitate sustainable practices, recognizing information as a strategic resource to strengthen knowledge management and improve connections between customers, the organizational environment, and sustainability goals (Fonseca et al., 2022 ).  2.4.5 Business excellence models, knowledge management and sustainable development Business excellence models play a crucial role in guiding KM initiatives, as Gloet and Samson (2017)  highlighted the underscores the relationship between KM, organizational sustainability, and sustainable environmental practices, emphasizing KM's contribution to innovation and sustainable operations. Leon (2014)  emphasizes that to combine the best characteristics of a sustainable organization and a knowledge-based organization, it's essential to develop organizational structures and practices that foster knowledge creation, dissemination, and use, collaboration, and program development that benefit various stakeholders. This involves setting short, medium, and long-term economic, environmental, and social goals. Laurett and Mendes (2019)  emphasize that achieving sustainable development requires strong leadership, clear strategic direction, human resource development, effective partnerships, and processes. Mohamed et al. (2009)  identify four key factors in achieving healthier sustainable development, with knowledge management being the first. Although literature lacks a defined set of aspects supporting the relationship between KM and sustainability, Arduini et al. (2023)  identify vision, strategy, action plan, knowledge processes, organizational structure, organizational effectiveness, and IT  infrastructure as fundamental to the KM-sustainability relationship. Shahzad et al. (2020)  assert that successful knowledge sharing in organizations results in improved operational, economic, and non-economic performance, along with better coordination with stakeholders, leading to enhancements in eco-innovation. Arduini et al. (2023)  argue that companies can do more in terms of KM to promote sustainability and reduce the efforts needed to achieve it. Gloet and Samson (2017)  point to the need for further studies on the potential of organizational excellence models (BEMs), along with their components like leadership, strategy, processes, infrastructure, resources, stakeholder interest, organizational culture, among others, in shaping KM practices to sustain organizational success toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   2.5 Knowledge Management Excellence Model The “Knowledge Management Excellence Model” (KMEM) by Barrantes-Briceño and Santos (2019)  was the initial iteration of a model that drew on a business excellence model, with the aim of utilizing KM as a support to become an indicator or metric for disseminating the SDGs to all stakeholders. The KMEM used KM frameworks and characteristics to become a new BEM that would ensure that the SDGs were met from an organizational point of view. Based mainly on the Management Excellence Model (MEG) of Brazil, the model comprises eight dimensions: Leadership, People, Strategies and Plans, Processes, Resources, Information and Knowledge, Society, and Results, as seen in Fig. 3  . However, the KMEM has its limitations, as the study revealed its status as an immature and evolving model with considerable room for development and enhancement. The analysis conducted by the KMEM focused on superficial information regarding each SDG, lacking in-depth exploration of relationships or the adoption of specific strategies. The assessment was solely qualitative and did not extend beyond general considerations, and it was not implemented in real-world scenarios. Acknowledging these limitations and recognizing the global context, it becomes imperative to understand the role that companies play in SDG achievement, beyond pursuing excellence in quality. Their interest extends to achieving comprehensive and optimal sustainable development. Moreover, exploring how knowledge management, characterized by adaptability and scalability with versatile applications in various contexts and problem-solving, can serve as a strategic tool for organizations to contribute effectively to the realization of the SDGs is essential.  2.6 Similar studies and literature gap Several studies have explored the interplay between three main concepts mentioned in this study (KM, BEMs and SDGs). Barrantes-Briceño and Santos (2019)  proposed a model connecting KM and excellence models to address SDGs. Di Vaio et al. (2020)  investigated the role of artificial intelligence in sustainable business models, highlighting the relationship between AI, sustainable development, and knowledge management systems. Fonseca (2022)  reviewed EFQM, revealing links with KM and BEMs concerning SDGs. Some studies, like Mansell et al. (2020) , employ models like “Infrastructure SDG Impact-Value Chain” to analyze local-global SDG impacts, connecting BEMs and SDGs but overlooking KM. Rosati et al. (2023)  explored organizational models’ innovation and SDGs, emphasizing how SDGs guide innovation opportunities. However, no study comprehensively explores the high-level relationship among KM, BEMs, and SDGs (see Table 1  ). None has presented a unified business model or tool encompassing SDGs through KM. Investigating these concepts' interrelation within a unified framework is crucial, aiding decisions for quality and sustainability processes. A KM-rooted model ensures timely access to accurate information, streamlining problem-solving and record-keeping. Integrating elements from BEMs like Malcolm Baldrige, EFQM, and MEG helps maintain high standards of quality and processes, aligning focus and economic goals seamlessly. The research aims to bridge existing gaps, addressing the interplay of KM, BEMs, and SDGs, providing a comprehensive framework for informed decision-making and sustainable business practices.   3 Methodology The methodology of this article was crafted to comprehensively address three research objectives (RO3, RO4, and RO5), ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the investigative process. The approach is primarily qualitative, with a transition to quantitative highlights, aligning with the exploratory objectives of familiarity and hypothesis building (Gerhardt and Silveira, 2009 ). The qualitative-exploratory design, justified by Gil (2017)  and Creswell and Creswell (2018) , involves exploring qualitative data followed by constructing a feature for testing in a subsequent quantitative phase. The qualitative-exploratory research utilizes quantitative results to interpret qualitative findings, emphasizing the development of instruments where validity outweighs reliability (Gil, 2017 ; Creswell and Creswell, 2018 ). The adopted methodology aims to verify qualitative validity through information assessment (Creswell and Clark, 2017 ). The RO3 explores the components linking knowledge management to business excellence models to select potential indicators. The RO4 guides the analysis of three BEMs in parallel with the proposed model. Finally, the RO5 directs the presentation and structuring of the model, exploring how knowledge management and business excellence models can be related and adapted to achieve Sustainable Development Goals in organizations. The methodology follows a logical and cohesive trajectory, substantially contributing to advancing knowledge in a field lacking information, theories, or hypotheses on key concepts. This initial phase employs a qualitative-exploratory emphasis, with a subsequent planned quantitative-explanatory stage in future work to demonstrate the study's reliability through variable relationships. 3.1 Model development roadmap For the construction of KMEM21, a two-fold analysis process was pursued. The first involved a literature review to identify connections between knowledge management and organizational excellence models and initiate the construction of indicators. The second front involved the analysis of three Business Excellence Models (BEMs) to aid in building the presented model. Fig. 4   provides a graphical overview of this roadmap. The following sections will elaborate on each of the steps outlined in the roadmap.  3.2 Selection of organizational concepts To establish and select indicators that aid in constructing the dimensions of KMEM21, a literature review was conducted to identify components or concepts linking Knowledge Management with Business Excellence Models. These were termed ‘organizational concepts' as they are inherent to the context, processes, and models of KM and business excellence. For this, the work of Oliveira et al. (2010)  served as a foundation, this study explores the connection between KM frameworks and the knowledge spiral, enumerating various aspects highlighted within the frameworks they analyzed. By cross-referencing the literature review and the aforementioned characteristics of KM and BEMs, a correlation with the work of Oliveira et al. (2010)  was identified. However, additional organizational concepts emerged during the review. Table 2   presents the organizational concepts found and selected from the analyzed sources. These organizational concepts would address the third research objective (RO3). After compiling and constructing Tables 2 , it was realized that some organizational concepts might not be relevant for selection as indicators. In this group, ‘Autonomy and individuality,’ ‘Benefits and rewards,’ ‘Commitment,’ ‘Financial resources,’ ‘Improvement plan,’ ‘Internal environment,’ ‘KM team and responsible,’ ‘Learning, innovation and creativity,’ and ‘System to motivate participation’ were inferred. However, further analysis and subsequent steps would be necessary to confirm or reject this hypothesis.  3.3 Model construction To build the model, we followed the theory indicated by the “Hilbert-Schule für Argumentation” (Hilbert School for argumentation), an institution in Germany, founded by Peter Hilbert, where people learn to argue, conquer and convince. The institution's aim is to teach effective communication for writing, as well as within the context of business, management and leadership, work techniques and behavior, as well as offering training and courses. According to Hilbert-Schule (2015) , in administration, leadership and project management there is always confusion over the use of the terms “method”, “instrument” and “technique”, indicating the difference and how these concepts are related (Fig. 5  ). The method is the way to reach a goal as it describes the path and explains why it leads to the goal. The method also provides the names of the instruments to be able to reach that goal. The instrument refers to all the tools such as plans, concepts, and procedures used in a method. The technique is simply how the instruments are used and handled. Finally, the goal is the objective or result to be achieved (Hilbert-Schule, 2015 ). Furthermore, when benchmarking the three mentioned BEMs (Malcolm Baldrige, EFQM, MEG), three consistent elements or components were identified in these models as mentioned in the introduction: An aesthetic model, a questionnaire for application, and a table or tool for assessing this questionnaire. In this way, it was understood that KMEM21 would have to have the same three elements, but in order to build these elements logically and correctly, the construction of each component was associated with the theory previously explained by Hilbert-Schule (2015) , becoming the main components that helped shape the model. Thus, the components shown in Fig. 5  are defined for the KMEM21 as follows:• Method:  The Questionnaire based on the relationship between organizational concepts and SDG goals.  • Instrument:  The model in its aesthetic and visual scheme, the hierarchy, and the role of dimensions.  • Technique:  The Scorecard that will evaluate, on a scale from 0 to 100%, the performance of the organizations in achieving the goal.  • Goal:  Percentage indication of the achievement of each of the SDGs when applied to each organization.    The methodology of each of the three BEMs stands out for its uniqueness, presenting a distinct approach for each model that lacks parallels in the literature. The development of these models is based on the studies conducted by the institutions that sponsor and implement them (National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST ) for Malcolm Baldrige, EuropeanFoundation  for Quality Management (EFQM) for EFQM, and National QualityFoundation  (FNQ) for MEG). Each model has its own philosophy and keeps its development process internal, with only the final model being made public. For this reason, few sources offer insights into their development, and the closest sources of information are the websites and guides provided by these institutions. Similarly, KMEM21 follows a unique methodological trajectory, as there are no prior references that can guide the process described above. Therefore, the construction of this model is based on the analysis and benchmarking of the websites, guides, and materials found from the three BEMs. In this research, we will detail the construction of the instrument and technique, offering guidance and recommendations for other researchers to replicate the model and establish their own method. The intention is to present in future works the practical implementation of KMEM21. This involves comparing the outcomes with the reports of five Brazilian organizations that are members of the Global Compact. 3.3.1 Instrument To build the instrument, the first step involved analyzing the three BEMs (Fig. 2 ) to identify common evaluation criteria among these models. Simultaneously, since KMEM21 is an enhancement of the first version, some of its dimensions were reformulated. Therefore, benchmarking was conducted for both the BEMs and the common evaluation criteria with KMEM to reshape the dimensions of the new model and proceed with the construction of the instrument. Subsequently, these common criteria were linked to the dimensions of KMEM21, creating a direct relationship between the BEMs (and consequently the theory behind them) and the proposed model. Structurally, some dimensions were re-evaluated in comparison with the KMEM (Fig. 3 ) and inspired by the MEG (FNQ, 2017 ) and EFQM (EFQM, 2019 ) models, as shown below:• From Leadership to Organizational Culture and Leadership  • From People to Employees and Collaborators  • Strategies and Plans remain the same  • From Processes to Processes and Operations  • Resources remain the same  • Information and Knowledge remain the same  • From Society to Society and Stakeholders  • From Results to High Impact Results    Table 3   shows the common criteria of the BEMs and their relationship with the (reformulated) KMEM21 dimensions. The ‘Sustainability’ criteria have no relationship with any of the KMEM21 dimensions because the model itself is intended to be an answer to the SD and an evaluator of the SDGs within organizations, which are elements directly related to sustainability. Likewise, there was no relationship between the dimensions of ‘Employees and Collaborators’ and ‘Resources’ with any common criteria of the BEMs as the criteria of ‘Stakeholders’, the closest to the dimension of ‘Employees and Collaborators’, had more weight on the external environment, society, and external stakeholders. These are elements directly linked to the dimension of ‘Society and Stakeholders’. This led to the construction of the instrument. The instrument is related to the visual presentation, the composition of the dimensions, the hierarchy of each dimension and the role they play in KMEM21. The model has a hexagon-shaped geometry (Fig. 6  ). The hexagon, as a logical tool, was discovered around 1950, and since then, it is considered a more powerful structure for logical thinking, compared to the square or the triangle. Mathematically, as a figure, it can exert some inspirational power over the human imagination (Moretti, 2012 ). In graphic design, it represents among other things intelligence, perfection, synergy, unity, work, and wisdom. The hexagon of KMEM21 has 6 colors, each color representing a dimension or set of dimensions within the color palette of the model. The definitions and purpose of each KMEM21 dimension are shown in Appendix A . The definition of new components of the KMEM21, like the hierarchy and the role of each dimension are shown in Appendix B .  3.3.2 Technique As a technique, a scorecard was developed, a constant component found in the BEMs studied in this research. This technique would help evaluate a set number of questions, which would be part of the suggested method for applying the KMEM21. This tool would also allow for working with the results together or separately, by dimensions or by areas of responsibility, to make the necessary analyses when devising strategies for the organizations. Fig. 7   show a graphic explanation of this description. The reasoning used to arrive at the technique was: Filter the organizational concepts identified (that relate KM and BEMs) in Table 2  with the definitions established for each of the eight dimensions of KMEM21 (Appendix A ). The relationship was made based on the description of the definitions and the purpose of each dimension. By studying which of these concepts are the most relevant for the model, they are transformed and called ‘KMEM21 indicators'. The selected concepts transformed into indicators that make up the dimensions of the model are presented in Appendix C . It is worth mentioning that their construction follows the same principles as the construction and application of the MEG, BEF, and EFQM because each one has its indicators in each of the criteria that compose them. With the organizational concepts transformed into indicators that constitute the dimensions of KMEM21, a direct relationship was established between the theoretical foundation of KM and BEMs with KMEM21. Since the construction of the instrument and the reformulation of dimensions went through benchmarking with the three BEMs, it can be asserted that a strong theoretical relationship was established between KM and BEMs with the proposed model. Establishing the indicators for KMEM21, they were analyzed alongside the 17 SDGs, the definition of each SDG, and the 169 targets. Indicators present in the SDGs were separated and selected to obtain the ‘SDG indicators'. Appendix D  is the result after the thorough analysis of the indicators strongly associated with the targets and the SDGs. With this, a relationship was built between indicators (which already have a theoretical basis of KM and BEMs) and the Sustainable Development Goals, subtly establishing a connection between KMEM21 and SDGs through these indicators. The explicit and perceptible relationship would occur when analyzing and choosing the indicators that are present in both each of the dimensions of KMEM21 (Appendix C ) and each of the SDGs (Appendix D ). To find the relationship between KMEM21 and the SDGs, the information from Appendix C and D  was reviewed and cross-checked. When an indicator was present on both sides, it was marked as a possible ‘relational indicator’. For example, the indicators present in both the Organizational Culture and Leadership dimension and in SDG 1 are: ‘External environment’, ‘Strategy’, ‘Improvement plan’, and ‘Training and development’; in total, four relational indicators. These relational indicators would be accounted for and the same exercise would be performed with all KMEM21 dimensions and the SDGs, resulting in Fig. 8  . With this in mind, a theoretical foundation was created to select and establish indicators that directly connect KMEM21 and the SDGs. In order to define the scores and number of questions to assess and create the technique, the idea was to divide the dimensions of KMEM21 according to the areas of responsibility as presented in Figure B2  of Appendix B . Additionally, based on the hierarchy of each dimension, as shown in Figure B1  of Appendix B , a percentage and weight were determined for each dimension and area of responsibility (Fig. 9  ). This indicates that the areas of responsibility ‘Direction’ and 'Results' are the most important, with the ‘Development’ area following with a higher weight. Meanwhile, the ‘Support’ area maintains a lower percentage weight. However, its dimension has the same percentage as the dimensions within the 'Results' area. Based on the defined percentage weights for each area of responsibility and each dimension of the model, a limit of 40 questions was established. The distribution is as follows (Fig. 10  ): For each area of responsibility:• Direction: 12 questions;  • Development: 10 questions;  • Support: 6 questions;  • Results: 12 questions.    For each dimension:• Organizational Culture and Leadership: 4 questions;  • Employees and Collaborators: 4 questions;  • Strategies and Plans: 4 questions;  • Processes and Operations: 5 questions;  • Resources: 5 questions;  • Information and Knowledge: 6 questions;  • Society and Stakeholders: 6 questions;  • High Impact Results: 6 questions.    With the information presented, the technique, which is the Scorecard, can be constructed, forming the second element of the KMEM21. The results of this technique are presented in Appendix E . This data allows for the development of the Questionnaire (method) designed to assess the level of compliance with each SDG in organizations. It is recommended to create a questionnaire with a maximum of 40 questions based on the provided data and analysis. The following section will showcase the research results along with recommendations for constructing and implementing the method.    4 Results The Scorecard provided in Appendix E  delineates the recommended approach for applying the KMEM21 technique. Taking into account the predetermined maximum question count, it is advisable that each question employs a four-option Likert scale, as suggested by Jacoby and Matell (1971) . This scale range aligns well with the utilization of ordinal data, as highlighted by Jamieson (2004) . To formulate questions for the Questionnaire, it is recommended to refer to the data in Fig. 8 , which guides the shaping of the questionnaire. Each question should draw from the highest count of relational indicators intersecting a dimension with an SDG. Note that the Scorecard provides guidance on the quantity of questions for each dimension. For example, let's consider the dimension ‘Organizational Culture and Leadership,’ proposing four questions. This dimension has a significant count of relational indicators connected to SDGs 8, 9, 12, and 16. Questions are crafted by integrating relational indicators shared between KMEM21 and the designated SDG (refer to Appendices C and D ). For SDG 8, the relational indicators include ‘Alignment with business objectives’, ‘Culture’, ‘External environment’, ‘Improvement plan’, ‘Learning, innovation and creativity’, ‘Support from top management’, ‘Strategy’, and ‘Training and development’. An example question could be, “Do top executives and leaders actively develop a quality plan and environment that allows for development and growth within the organization as part of the business objectives?" Analyzing this example, it contains five of the eight relational indicators, ‘Alignment with business objectives’, ‘Culture’, ‘Improvement plan’, ‘Support from top management’ and ‘Training and development’, demonstrating a high degree of synchronization to assess SDG 8 within of that dimension. It is therefore recommended to create each question for KMEM21. The Scorecard serves the purpose of assessing the impact of the SDGs within the organization, delineating their level of prominence as strongly present, moderately present, or absent. The outcomes can be examined on a question-by-question basis, across dimensions, within specific areas, or through comparative analysis between different organizations. If a dimension or area falls below an acceptable threshold, a counteractive assessment occurs by scrutinizing the questions and relational indicators. The goal is to ascertain constituent relational indicators, prompting subsequent measures to implement or enhance them within the organizational framework. For instance, for the question above, if the block of the dimension ‘Organizational Culture and Leadership’ is below the allowed value, an analysis explores factors like executive involvement, support, and alignment with business goals. Thus, a diagnosis is created to help the organization align and move toward the SDGs. After the Scorecard is defined, the next step is to devise the method in the form of a questionnaire with the aforementioned instructions and then apply the KMEM21. However, this is expected to be a topic dealt with in another paper as the scope of this article is to present the new model, the construction of the instrument and the technique.  5 Discussion of findings The methodology followed a qualitative-exploratory process, exploring qualitative data, followed by constructing a feature for testing in a subsequent quantitative phase. The adopted methodology aimed to verify qualitative validity through information evaluation—specifically, the entire process of constructing KMEM21. Drawing on theory of Hilbert-Schule (2015) , this process aimed to integrate key concepts and objectives of this research. The findings in this paper outline a path for building an instrument and technique that integrate knowledge management and business excellence models organizational concepts into a single organizational excellence and sustainable model, to effectively pursues the UN Sustainable Development Goals within organizations. Section ‘2.4. Relationship between concepts' addressed the first research objective (RO1), demonstrating the literature's connection between sustainable development, Sustainable Development Goals, Business Excellence Models, and Knowledge Management. This review showcased the significance of these topics and how their interrelation could contribute to the proposed model's construction. Regarding the second research objective (RO2), while there are studies resembling the proposed approach, none comprehensively explore the high-level relationship between KM, BEMs, and SDGs. No existing business model or unified tool was found to encompass SDGs through KM. This highlights the importance of investigating the interrelation of these concepts in a unified framework, aiding decision-making on quality and sustainability processes. The literature review assisted in identifying and selecting organizational concepts between Knowledge Management and the chosen Business Excellence Models (FNQ's Management Excellence Model in Brazil, Baldrige Excellence Framework in the United States, and The EFQM Model in Europe). This process achieved the third research objective (RO3) by presenting potential indicators that would contribute to the dimensions of KMEM21. Several organizational concepts were excluded during the model review, including ‘Benefits and rewards,’ ‘Commitment,’ ‘Financial resources,’ ‘Infrastructure,’ ‘Internal environment,’ ‘Investing in knowledge,’ ‘KM team and responsible,’ and ‘System to motivate participation.’ These exclusions contradicted some hypotheses raised in the ‘3.2. Selection of organizational concepts' section. Regarding the fourth research objective (RO4), which involved the analysis and benchmarking between the three chosen BEMs and the proposed model, the results can be seen in section ‘3.3.1. Instrument’ and Table 3 . The interpretation of common criteria from the BEMs, along with the relationship of KMEM21 dimensions, is presented. Notably, five of the eight dimensions were reformulated in this version compared to KMEM, based on the BEMs' analysis. Section ‘3.3. Model construction’ introduces the proposed model and its development, with additional elements like Appendices A, B, C, and D  contributing to fulfilling the fifth research objective (RO5). The sixth and final research objective (RO6) aimed to establish the relationship between KMEM21 and the Sustainable Development Goals. This objective was achieved in the explanation provided in section ‘3.3.2. Technique’ along with Appendices C, D , and specifically D. Appendix D  summarizes the analysis, outlining the interaction of organizational concepts connecting Knowledge Management and Business Excellence Models, facilitating the achievement of SDGs. Fig. 8  illustrates the number of relational indicators between KMEM21 dimensions and the SDGs, demonstrating a substantial and robust correlation between a new business excellence model (also considered a sustainable business model in the literature) and the SDGs. The existence of these indicators does not preclude the possibility of other indicators (originally analyzed as organizational concepts) that also have a relationship with GC, BEMs, and SDGs. An analysis of new concepts may be a path to explore, aiming to understand the relationship or contrast with the indicators selected in this study. It was also found that the dimensions and indicators composing KMEM21 align with theories and findings from other studies, such as Marti (2004)  eight-factor framework, Handžić (2011)  empirical model, Tuamsuk et al. (2013)  seven success factors, Alvino et al. (2021)  Word Correlation Index and; Fan and Chang (2021)  Sustainable Business Excellence Model. This indicates that the model is consistent with existing theories in the literature. According to North and Kumta (2018) , business excellence is a set of practices that rubricate developing and strengthening an organization's management systems and processes to improve performance and create value for stakeholders. Therefore, from this definition, KMEM21 is considered to be a BEM as it uses certain basic principles cited above. Likewise, KMEM21 can be regarded as a sustainable business model, aligning with the description of a sustainable business model transformation: “The current business model is changed, resulting in a sustainable business model” as posited by Geissdoerfer et al. (2018) . Based on the study conducted by Bocken et al. (2014) , KMEM21 would align with the sustainable business model archetype of ‘Develop scale-up solutions,’ presenting extensive sustainable solutions that optimize societal and environmental advantages. This model is rooted in sustainability principles and is tailored to organizational needs. Highlighting the distinction from conventional BEMs, it becomes evident that these tools are evaluations of performance excellence (Garza-Reyes et al., 2015 ). They serve as a means to attain acknowledgment and secure quality accolades on a local, national, or regional scale, showcasing business excellence and attaining elevated quality benchmarks (Toma and Marinescu, 2018 ). In this context, KMEM21 goes one step further, as it not only works in a similar way to a BEM, as aspires not only to achieve a high level of quality and business excellence, but also to set a high standard for sustainability and business excellence by fulfilling the UN SDGs. KMEM21 improved aspects such as dimensions, design and aesthetics, and relational indicators linked to KM and the BEMs, solving existing gaps regarding its construction and application. The main goal is to make it a more applicable and useful model for organizations to achieve excellence in quality and sustainability aiming at achieving the SDGs and improving processes for the benefit of sustainable development. Furthermore , existing BEMs, along with their associated quality awards, can serve as motivational tools for organizations and employees to reach established goals. By adapting these models to incorporate sustainability and align with the SDGs, organizations can gain recognition for their contributions to sustainable development. BEMs, when integrated with sustainability goals, enhance the likelihood of successful goal attainment, promoting awareness and commitment to the 2030 Agenda.  6 Conclusions and implications 6.1 Conclusions The article proposes the construction of a theoretical framework that combines Knowledge Management (KM) and Business Excellence Models (BEMs) to suggest a method applicable in organizations that directly contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The aim is to create a new model, the KMEM21, that leverages KM and BEMs to support sustainable development and SDG attainment. This work defines KM as encompassing various activities and processes involving knowledge and information, aimed at optimizing organizational capacity, growth, and adaptability to changes. This definition lays the groundwork for further exploration of KM's role in relation to the constructed framework. The paper emphasizes the integration of KM and three specific business excellence models (Management Excellence Model, Baldrige Excellence Framework, and EFQM). This integration uncovers relationships between organizational concepts associated with KM and BEMs, which contributes to new insights in the literature regarding these concepts' interplay. BEMs are presented as tools that can catalyze the power of KM towards achieving SDGs. However, it's noted that the existing BEMs might not be adequate, as the goal extends beyond organizational improvement to encompass sustainable development aligned with SDGs. The article suggests that specific organizational concepts, identified through a literature review and aligned with KM and BEMs, can be selected as indicators associated with the constructed KMEM21 and the SDGs. These selected indicators are intended to form a bridge between the model and the SDGs. The analysis points out that SDG 3, which focuses on human well-being and health, didn't exhibit a strong relationship with the constructed framework's indicators. This disconnection may occur because the targets that make up this SDG are related to the well-being of human beings, to life human health, individual health, among other factors, thus by exploring the relationship between these targets and KMEM21 indicators (which in essence are organizational concepts), a direct relationship was not found. However, it's acknowledged that even though this SDG might not align directly in theory, in practice, it could still find a place within the evaluation criteria due to the KMEM21's adaptable nature and continuous improvement philosophy. The article envisions future steps, including the presentation of the KMEM21 Questionnaire as a method applicable to sustainability objectives and SDG achievement. This application is intended to showcase the practical implementation of the KMEM21 in five Brazilian companies. The article concludes that this model could be validated and improved upon by other researchers interested in merging sustainability, knowledge management, excellence, and quality in organizational contexts.  6.2 Implications 6.2.1 Theoretical implications The paper highlights the interconnection of various concepts. It would establish a theoretical foundation for how knowledge management practices can contribute to achieving SDGs while aligning with a business excellence model. Also, could bridge the gap between disciplines such as management, sustainability, sustainable development, quality, and business excellence. This could lead to the development of a more comprehensive framework that considers multiple perspectives. The integration of SDGs and business excellence suggests a comprehensive approach to sustainability that includes economic, environmental, and social dimensions. This could contribute to the theoretical discourse on holistic sustainability within organizations. The article discusses how knowledge management can help organizations adapt to the evolving landscape of SDGs and changing business priorities. This could contribute to theories on organizational learning and adaptation.  6.2.2 Managerial implications The paper highlights the importance of aligning knowledge management strategies with the organization's commitment to achieving SDGs. This could guide managers in creating coherent strategies. Likewise, the integration of these concepts could emphasize the role of knowledge sharing, innovation, and collaboration in achieving SDGs while pursuing business excellence. Managers could gain insights into how to measure performance not only in terms of financial success, but also in terms of contributions to the SDGs and adherence to models of excellence. The article shows the role of knowledge management as an opportunity to engage employees by involving them in meaningful work related to sustainability, which could lead to increased morale and retention.  6.2.3 Policy implications Policymakers might be encouraged to promote knowledge-sharing networks and provide incentives for organizations to align their practices with SDGs and business excellence. Policymakers could focus on promoting collaborations between the public and private sectors to leverage knowledge resources for the SDGs and the pursuit of excellence. For example, collaboration between researchers from higher education institutions and private organizations. The integration of the concepts mentioned above could lead policymakers to invest in programs that improve knowledge management capabilities among companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.
