                  Strict environmental concern, depletion, and price hike of building construction materials are driving scientific studies for the search of alternative materials for building construction. To this end sustainable building materials could be a fruitful solution. This review aims to discern the environmental efficacy of solid waste management (SWM) and its relationship with four stimuli i.e., economic structure, regulatory structure, science, and time. The study also highlights the investigation of governance network to figure out the regulatory structure and governance of waste management. Extensive details on solid waste with their sources, recycling potential and their current utilization for substantial development are outlined. A throughout of the production process, properties, advantages, disadvantages, and the global economy of building material developed through recycling of solid waste are discussed. This article also deals with the sustainability, social, and environmental impact of green building materials. The study identifies the future direction for the effective utilization of solid waste for developing building materials. Further, the scope of the present also focusses on the concept of circular economy for developing construction materials through recycling of solid waste, which provides an easy reference for solid waste processing towards sustainability.

Strict environmental concern, depletion, and price hike of building construction materials are driving scientific studies for the search of alternative materials for building construction. To this end sustainable building materials could be a fruitful solution. This review aims to discern the environmental efficacy of solid waste management (SWM) and its relationship with four stimuli i.e., economic structure, regulatory structure, science, and time. The study also highlights the investigation of governance network to figure out the regulatory structure and governance of waste management. Extensive details on solid waste with their sources, recycling potential and their current utilization for substantial development are outlined. A throughout of the production process, properties, advantages, disadvantages, and the global economy of building material developed through recycling of solid waste are discussed. This article also deals with the sustainability, social, and environmental impact of green building materials. The study identifies the future direction for the effective utilization of solid waste for developing building materials. Further, the scope of the present also focusses on the concept of circular economy for developing construction materials through recycling of solid waste, which provides an easy reference for solid waste processing towards sustainability.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Solid waste management  Recycling  Sustainability  Circular economy    1 Introduction Economic growth together with urban agglomeration results in a vigorous rise in the quantity and variety of the waste that establishes waste management as a critical issue to the world (Elagroudy et al., 2016 ). The dependency of the fate of waste on multiple factors made the SWM as arduous, multi-dimensional issue comprising of technical and economic facts, sustainable development issues and normative constraints about the minimum need for recycling (Bozo, 2021 ; Maheshwari et al., 2022 ; Marshall and Farahbakhsh, 2013 ). The waste management systems initialize from storing waste in storage tanks and consist of the whole life cycle of solid waste (collection, shipment, recovery process, treatment, elimination). The generation, collection and processing of waste, and its emission to water, soil and air affect the health of the environmental and public in various ways (Saeidi et al., 2021 ). Before 1990, In Romania, waste management was not significantly adopted however through the catalogue of waste the first statics were reported in 1993 (Åchiopu et al., 2007 ). European legislation on waste had interchanged into Romanian legislation and ultimately the National Waste Management Strategy (NWMS) has been defined for framing waste management objectives intended to build the basic structure for the implementation and development of integrated waste management and National Waste Management Plan (NWMP) for implementing the National Waste Management Strategy (NWMS) (SolÃ­s-GuzmÃ¡n et al., 2014 ). The land filling was a frequently used method (99%) during 1998 for waste disposal in Romania (NWMP, 2014â2020). Some change over the period was given to India to accomplish the EU guidelines for the cache of non-hazardous industrial waste by 2013; a momentary cache of hazardous waste by 2009; municipal waste sites by 2019. Numerous cites (177) should be shut down and the volume of waste landfills should be progressively reduced (Saeidi et al., 2021 ). Romania has started to curb the storage task in 205 operational non-compliant municipal landfills operating in 2008. To implement the integrated waste management system and shut down of stores opening line, ISPA financed projects, or various other financing sources along with public-private partnerships arrangement were done. Decisive steps should be taken to find out the most competent method for recycling and recovery of waste by identifying waste origin and numerous waste composition (Ghinea et al., 2014 ). Romania acknowledges that the success of recovery and recycling highly depends upon the fact that whether the recovered and recycled material will be consumed in the specific industries or not so that production technology used in plastic, glass, paper, metal, cardboard industries should be well-accustomed to use recycled or recovered materials such as for a papermaking industry, the recovered paper is the prominent source of fibre as the paper has to be gathered separately from waste and other recyclables that too are under the supervision of local authorities hence industry cannot do paper recycling and paper recovery alone (Ghinea et al., 2014 ). Fig. 1   given below shows the recycling potentials of different solid waste. A voluntary dedication of various professional organizations under the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) initiatives to attain a recycling rate of 20% in 2005 resulted in an increment in the management of waste paper through recycling (Esmaeilian et al., 2018 ).Waste management in an environmentally and economically with social acceptability leads to waste management sustainably Rosdin et al., 2021 . Since every waste management system has some intricacies and specialties so a particular waste management system can't be suitable for attaining peculiar objectives like waste schemes and distinct environmental objective (confined to site special restraints such as waste releasing rate, waste content, installed treatment capacity, waste geographical origin, and waste management technologies). Thus, the decision support model is essential comprehensive tools to reduce the eco-efficient objective functions confined to a set of social, logistical, environmental and technical constraints (Filatov et al., 2019 ; Qureshi et al., 2021 ). A model based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (GaBi software) was proposed to understand the impacts of various waste management scenarios as an alternative to the MSW management system existent in Iasi in 2009 and to identify the outcomes of two different scenarios which includes manufacturing of paper from virgin fiber and recycling of paper products to tissue paper (Ghinea et al., 2014 ). This comprehensive investigation depicts that there is a strong urgency for a neat and clean environment which made citizen's awareness and participation mandatory. The effectiveness of municipal waste collection services increases when it is synchronized with society backed primary collection from the house. It is quite obvious that if the services are sincere and reliable then the communities are quite amenable to pay the price. As around 52.5% of respondents agreed to pay the amount decided by the community for collecting solid waste, 38.75% showed their willingness to transport their waste to the communal container, while 8.75% of respondents were willing to isolate organic waste and recyclables (Kashyap and Visvanathan, 2014 ). The results had showed that to bring a significant degree of sustainability, the integration of numerous factors is of prime importance. Community-based waste management recognizes the fact that to impart sustainability in waste collection service large income opportunities in recycling should be generated that aimed to bring a profound change in people's habit and attitude related to solid waste collection and disposal (Ackerman, 2005 ; Alam et al., 2022 ; Rhyner et al., 2017 ; Zhang et al., 2010 ). Hence, the community-based waste management is the most encouraging way of safeguarding the environment in low-income settlements. Moreover, to make community-based waste management practically viable the community leader and related organization should work to bring the required change in people's attitude and habit. The success of waste management based on the community is the bank on the capability of community leaders to pursue their community members (Esmaeilian et al., 2018 ; Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata, 2012 ; Narayana, 2009 ). Every facet of environmental protection and cleanliness act as a tool for comprehensive waste management. This paper discusses the current status of generation and utilization of solid waste, environmental implication, identifies the recycling potentials of solid waste for constructive building material, and suggests effective utilization of solid waste as a resource for attaining sustainability. Table 1   illustrates the sources and typical generators for different solid waste. 1.1 Global scenario of solid waste management As part of the review the section summarizes the existing scenario of solid waste in different countries of the globe. There is found a great difference in the characteristics and quantity of the existing solid waste, variations in economic status, living standard and literacy rate are causes for such difference (Castaldi et al., 2017 ; Pappu et al., 2007 ). Earlier studies estimate the rate of generation of solid waste from the major cities of the globe to 1.3 billion tons/year, and the figure is expected to reach 2.2 billion tons/year by 2025 this is equivalent to an increase from 1.2Â kg/capita/day to 1.42Â kg/capita/day assuming a global urban population of 4.3 billion in 2025 (Alzamora and Barros, 2020 ). Fig. 2   given below illustrate the projections for MSW generation (tons/capita) for different countries by 2025. The generation rate of solid waste for developed countries is correlated with GDP per capita income. Table 2   given below shows the expected waste generation in urban areas based on the level of income. For example, at present USA is generating about 0.64Â MT/day of municipal solid waste, followed by Germany, Mexico and Japan are having a generation rate of 0.14Â MT/day, 0.13Â MT/day, and 0.10Â MT/day respectively. However, for developing countries there is no such dependency on the rate of generating waste on GDP per capita income (X. Li, Zhang, Li and Zhi, 2016 ) also due to unplanned settlement and industrialization this scenario is more worrisome for underdeveloped countries like Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sudan, etc. Kawai and Tasaki (2016)  reported an increasing trend of waste generation for undeveloped, developing, and developed countries that accounted for 23%, 37%, and 40% of global waste generation (Kawai and Tasaki, 2016 ). The variation in solid waste generation and practices followed for managing the generated waste were found to closely relate to the economic status. The underdeveloped and developing countries are having a lack of proper processing channels besides many other challenges (Kolekar et al., 2017 ). Table 3   given shows the rate of waste generation per capita across the different regions of the globe. The per capita rate forÂ municipal solid waste generation varies from 0.09Â kg/day in Sub-Saharan Africa to 5.70Â kg/day in the Middle East and North Africa. Moreover, the rate of per capita waste generation in East Asia and the Pacific are equivalent to the waste generation ofÂ South America and West America and West India along with the Gulf and Northern America (Alzamora and Barros, 2020 ). Japan generates about 52 million tons of solid waste out of the total generated waste, 77.4% is incinerated, 16.7% is recycled and 5.9% is landfilled. Waste is one of the concerns for European countries and has been increase in recycling practice than recovering energy while in the United States, there has been shown at the expense of landfill. The Environmental Protection Agency in USA had targeted for reducing 25% of waste at landfills by the year 2000. The Environmental Protection Agency of the United State had estimated to double the material recovery rate by the 1990s, that accounted for 30% of waste management as a result the energy recovery has been increased by 21% as a result only 49% of the generated solid waste is resting for landfilling (McCarthy, 1993 ). The solid waste management in cities of developing countries with importance to public and environmental health is unsatisfactory (Steel, 1996 ). The waste in developing countries is highly organic with low contaminants suggests it for anaerobic digestion and composting. The high densities of generated solid waste reduce the requirement of advanced compactor for transportation and labour cost for recycling and scavenging. In a developing country a quite proportion of the population depends on recycling of waste for their livelihood. According to Suchada et al. there is a reduction in the amount of waste disposal by one-third, and accounts for 90% of waste materials as recyclable by diverting from landfilling (Suchada et al., 2003 ). Estimations of the waste generated waste for the year 1965â2100 with the application of compositional Bayesian regression found that rate of waste generation increases at declining economic development as the global generation for solid waste has reached to 1999Â Mt in 2015 from 635Â Mt in 1965 and is expected to 3539Â Mt by 2050. The share for organic waste was globally decreased from 47% to 39% from the year 2015â2050 while the shares for other types of waste is decreases. The generation of waste diverts from the Kuznets curve for the environment besides failure to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals for reducing waste. The earlier studies indicate insufficient improvement in waste reduction that could improve the environment condition. India spends about 20â50% of the sanctioned budgets for the management of the generated solid waste (V. Srivastava, Ismail, Singh and Singh, 2015 ), and is producing approximately 42 million tons of MSW per year including residential and commercial waste. The average waste generation for Indian cities comprise of 40% as vegetables waste, paper, 0.62% plastic, 0.62% ceramics, 0.64% metals, 42% sand & grit and others 11.73%. Further, it is reported that in every Indian city the common practices of managing the solid waste start from the collection, segregation, transportation, and disposal as shown in Fig. 3   and few of the cities are following the practice of recycling system of waste plastic, glass, and metals. Bottles made of plastic, glasses, or metals do not decompose easily. The detail of lifespan for wastes which take longer to decompose than any other waste is shown in Table 4   . However, its potential of being considered as part of alternative construction material is a passage to a solution of reducing landfill disposal of the waste resource and this can tip-off to resolve environment concern and high-cost price of housing as well (Suriapparao et al., 2020 ). Moreover, waste is imported from developed countries like the U.S., Canada, Australia, and some European countries (Patil and Ramakrishna, 2020 ). A case study over the past 22 years on Municipal Solid Waste management for developing countries here Kenya was taken for the study indicates that the average waste collection in Nairobi is less than 40% of the generated solid waste and generated waste is disposed of as landfills without any concern for environmental pollution, indicating poor MSW disposal as the major cause of urban pollution (Henry et al. 2006 ). In Nepal, it is reported about 35â55% of the generated waste is collected (Gurung and Oh, 2012 ) while poor infrastructure with lack of technology is a challenge for some other developing countries like Ethiopia (Getahun et al., 2012 ; Omran and Gavrilescu, 2008 ) Iran (P. Srivastava, Kulshreshtha, Mohanty, Pushpangadan and Singh, 2005 ), and India (Vishwakarma et al., 2012 ). However, the absence of framework and observing capacity are the responsible factors for limiting the effectiveness of waste management efforts (A. A. Kumar and Selvan, 2017 ). Tanzania, is another developing country, is concerned with the top level of urban pollution due to municipal solid waste (Huisman et al., 2016 ; Mgaya and Nondek, 2004 ). On average the annual per capita waste generation for the developed and developing countries lies between 521.95-759.2Â kg and 109.5â525.6Â kg respectively hence MSW management is essential for environmental protection (Narayana, 2009 ). The population division of the United Nations World Bank estimates the generation of solid waste to 27 billion tons in 2050 (Stakhiv and Allman, 1997 ). In 1997 the global generation of solid waste was 0.49 billion tons and is estimated to increase annually atÂ 2â3% and 3.2â4.5% in developing and developed countries respectively (Ferronato and Torretta, 2019 ).Â The generation of municipal solid waste (in million tons) with the rate of generation (in kg/person/person) from 1998 to 2008 that indicates an increased MSW in the 15 countries of EU-15 (consists of 15 countries) by 4.6% from 540 to 565 kpc. It was observed that only a fraction of construction and demolition solid waste is recycled or reused while the major part of the waste is being deposited or used as landfill. The Dubai municipality's waste management estimated that developed countries generate 500â1000Â kg/year of construction waste while European countries generated about 175 million tons/year.Fig. 4   indicates the composition for the generated solid waste in developed (US and EU) and in nineteen developing countries.  1.2 Problem statement Repercussions of unceasing industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth are seen as the causes for increased volume and variety of solid waste such that its sustainable and effective management has emerged as major trouble for the government. In 2006, 2.02 billion tons of municipal solid waste were generated which is 7% higher than reported in 2003 as per Global waste management report 2007. The report further indicates that in 2011 the worldwide municipal waste generation will be increased by 37.3% which is tantamount to a yearly increase of approximately 8%. In urban and rural communities of developing countries solid waste is manifested as air pollution due to its burning as well as water pollution because of dumping in waterways. The unavailability of appropriate and effective utilities for disposal of solid waste in the urban area resulted in a stockpile of garbage in the open space of urban areas. Investigation of smog emitted from Spanish and Kingston town by the Pan-America Health Organization (PAHO) in 1989 revealed the existence of particulate matter which was four-time larger than the USEPA standard of 260Â mg/m3  with 1000Â mg/m3  as the average value which is considered as the primary reason for respiratory tract related infection over the Kingston and is responsible for asthma and eye diseases. In several Indian cities leniency in adopting solid waste management in the past brought severe challenges for local government to carry out the required changes in their services to confront with the rapidly growing population. Long-term and inefficient dumping of generated solid waste in the cause of concern for municipalities. The extent of human risk related to solid waste disposal and handling varies with nation and the problem is more critical in developing nations. India generates about 290Â MT of inorganic industrial waste annually (Hannan et al., 2020 ) while pharmaceutical, refinery, galvanization, electroplating, metal extraction processes, pesticide industries and petrochemical industries generate around 4.5Â MT hazardous waste (Pant et al., 2019 ). The wastes produced from agricultural sources are cotton stalk, sugarcane bagasse, ground nutshell, wooden mill waste, waste of vegetable, oil production, paddy, and wheat straw, food products, coconut husk, tea, jute fibre, etc. (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2020 ; Salam & Kumar, 2020 ), copper, bauxite red mud, iron trailing, aluminium trailing, coal combustion residues and zinc extraction process are considerable industrial non-hazardous inorganic solid waste. However, it is anticipated that generated solid waste in India is quite more than the reported data. Fig. 5   gives the status of solid waste generation in India in million tons/year. Previously piled up solid wastes and its rising generation rates are the responsible factors for pollution. Because of energy consumption, environmental deterioration and monetary constraints numerous organizations in India and aboard have suggested various qualitative instructions for transport, disposal, generation, recycling, treatment, and handling of hazardous and non-hazardous waste (Arvanitoyannis and Kassaveti, 2008 ; Hammitt and Reuter, 1989 ; Saxena and Jotshi, 1996 ). Heterogeneity in solid waste makes recycling a quite complex process. It is the characteristics of feed raw material, its mineralogical origin, process efficiency, and operating process which decides the physiochemical characteristics of solid wastes (Agrawal et al., 2004 ; Chakraborty et al., 2013 ; Yusuf et al., 2021 ; Hammitt and Reuter, 1989 ; Mukherjee, 2013 ; Pant et al., 2019 ; Saxena and Jotshi, 1996 ) . It is quite obvious from the properties waste created from various processes that solid waste is having potential for the development of materials for applications in building construction through recycling.   2 Generation, recycling and utilization of solid waste The conventional building material such as steel, distemper, brick, stone, paint, clay, block, timber, cement, tiles, gravels, sand, etc. used by construction industries are derived from natural resources thus the infrastructure development puts huge pressure on the environment by unceasing exploitation of natural resources. During the production of building material particularly for the production of cement, oxide of nitrogen and sulphur, carbon monoxide and suspended particles are heavily released into the atmosphere results in contamination of fauna, water aquatic life, soil, air, flora and lethally affect the human health. Due to the soaring cost of conventional building material and impartation of various lethal effects on the environment during the production of conventional building material there arise a need for alternative conventional building material (Graeff, 2011 ; Huang et al., 2007 ; Tallini and Cedola, 2018 ). The advancement and up gradation in SWM technology has provided a promising substitute for conventional building material. It is known that to conserve the valuable resources and save energy effective recycling of solid waste has acquired the prime importance globally. There is a need for extensive Research and Development (R&D) to search newer technologies as well as for utilizing present technology effectively so that sustainability in SWM can be achieved. The secondary industries and informal sector in India recycle about 15%â20% of solid waste for numerous building components (Buenrostro et al., 2001 ; Kalyani and Pandey, 2014 ). It is reported that a considerable quantity of virgin material is consumed in highway pavement construction while mineral aggregate makes a considerable composition with respect to material consumption (Ojedokun, 2011 ). Industrial activities like manufacturing of steel and iron generate waste that is referred as industrial by-products while recycled concrete and asphalt pavement are considered as pavement by-products. Steel slag and recycled concrete Pavement (RCP) act as a suitable substitute for unbound or partial bound aggregates while Coal Fly Ash (CFA) and Recycled Asphalt Shingles (RAS) act as replacements for Portland cement or asphalt binder. The explicit composition and description of practically recycled material, application of industrial by-products and waste as raw material or aggregate is of prime importance for developing the construction material as a replacement for conventional material and providing supplementary for the construction industry. Various steps have been taken for developing mathematical models with a view to attaining environmental friendly waste management (Sharholy and Ahmad, 2008 ). Table 6   given below summarizes different practical recyclable solid waste. 2.1 Generation, recycling, and utilization of organic solid waste Domestic refuses, forming wastes, urban and municipal wastes, agro-industrial waste, and horticulture waste are the sources of organic solid waste. The availability of manpower, technological innovations and agricultural resources led to the emergence of various agro-industries. India is quite rich in agricultural resources therefore agricultural activities like agro-industrial processing, crop harvest, crop production, sawmilling generates a huge amount of agricultural waste like the sugar industry generates approximately 90Â MT bagasse annually which is further used in the production of corrugating medium, wall panels, printing paper and insulation board (Tallini and Cedola, 2018 ). Decaying of urban-organic waste and animal dead body in anaerobic or aerobic conditions produces a significant amount of methane which reduces the greenhouse gases and reduces global warming. Since the burning of agricultural waste produces the gasses that are responsible for global warming therefore agricultural wastes are a major cause of concern. In this section recycling of various organic wastes includes cashew nutshell, mahua, linseed residues, peanut husk, rubber seed pod, coconut coir dust, etc. as a building material have been explored with various applications are illustrated below in Table 7  .  2.2 Generation, recycling, and utilization of inorganic solid waste Inorganic solid waste may be hazardous or non-hazardous in nature. The waste generated during the secondary process of non-ferrous metal (lead, copper, zinc) are the primary source of inorganic hazardous waste while, mining wastes are a major source of inorganic non-hazardous solid waste. The following section discusses the generation of inorganic solid waste along with their recycling potentials and impact on the environment.  2.3 Recycling attitudes and behaviour towards waste management The success of any recycling program lies with people's attitude and behaviour toward waste making the understanding of people's attitudes and behaviour for waste an important factor. The generated solid waste cannot be managed effectively without the contribution of the public efforts. Moreover, to build up the recycling projects it is crucial to recognize who recycles, why do recycling and how to recycle. This section discusses the attitude and behaviour of the public towards the management of solid waste across the countries and puts forward some suggestions to improve the recycling of municipal solid waste for the advancement of building construction materials. The attention for the conservation of attitudes and recycling behaviour was realized in the mid-1970s during energy crises that understand the public behaviour towards the environment and the importance of conservation behaviour and there is found to exist a difference in waste management practices between developed and developing countries. The developed countries generate more industrial waste compared to developing countries therefore the recycling in developed countries concentrates on technical application and psychological and socio-economic influences on human behaviour (Barlishen and Baetz, 1995 ; Sharifianjazi et al., 2021 ). However, the research in the developing countries is less concentrates on the indirect motives of one's behaviour and more concentrated on the practical factors and components associated with Municipal Solid Waste Management. Table 5  given below gives the values in percentages of waste recovery for the thirteen developing countries. The worldwide sorting, collection and reuse of waste are commonly referred to as recycling for many developed countries. In most of the countries the burying of waste as landfill is generally adopted practices for disposal of solid waste and is also the cheapest practice of disposing municipal solid waste (Troschinetz, 2005 ). A study conducted for recycling observed competencies as the best predictors of actual behaviour. The study on recycling actions in Wagan (China) established age, income, and gender as the responsible factors for influencing the recycling behaviour. Guerrero, Maas and Hogland (2013) ; Hornik et al. (1995) ; Junnila and Horvath (2003)  for investigating the correlation between action and knowledge concerning the environment and factors influencing the attitudes and behaviour for recycling and examined that China residents are having good knowledge of waste management and concern about the environment and willing to involve in recycling than US citizens (Harvie and Jaques, 2003 ). The literature showed a diverse behaviour of peoples towards recycling like people in a China's city and are aware of regional environmental condition and shows a willingness to make green purchases for improvement of the environment while the Ningbo residents were not pleased with their environment but were willing to share responsibility towards the environment. The lack of recycling awareness and negative behaviour of the public of Tieman Island, Indonesia (Manual, 2009 ) hindering the recycling process and authorities are willing to motivate recycling to overcome the environmental issue. In Canada, good participation of peoples for recycling practices is observed with awareness, and willingness for promoting recycling and educating about recycling practices. In 2013, the generated waste in UAE was 27 million tons having a population of 9.2 million (Zhang et al., 2010 ). However, no data had been reported about the distribution of different types of waste. ArÄ± and YÄ±lmaz, 2016 ; illustrated positive ideas about the application of recycled product construction (ArÄ± and YÄ±lmaz, 2016 ). It was found that there exists a long-term practice of recycling in various with varying income levels (Magutu et al., 2010 ). A survey conducted in Nairobi, Kenya to study the behaviour and attitudes responsible for improper behaviour management of waste found that 93% of the informant, declared solid waste as an issue. Moreover, the problem of the little amount of recycling was felt by about 30% of the public and nearly 40% recommend declares and support for recycling also suggests commercials sectors should invest in the sector of recycling of solid (Mwanthi et al., 1997 ). The behaviour was found to be influenced by the categories that can be either personal or corporate in the sector of waste management also the behaviour of these categories is influenced by attitude and training (Henry et al., 2006 ). Therefore, it can be illustrated that positive ideas about waste recycling generate good impacts on the recycling of solid waste as construction materials. The earlier studies showed that the variation in attitude and behaviour towards solid waste management is because of the insufficiency of equipment and facilities for managing solid waste includes an insufficient quantity of recycling bins with long-distance, ineffective technology, lack of transport facilities, etc. 2.3.1 Generation, recycling, and utilization of hazardous inorganic wastes Waste such as mining waste (lead, zinc, copper), marble processing waste, construction debris, non-ferrous metal waste are the primary source of inorganic hazardous solid waste. This section highlights the source of the generation and recycling potential of hazardous inorganic solid waste. It is reported that India generates about 4.5Â MT of hazardous waste yearly out of the total generated waste 2.5Â MT are disposable, 1.7Â MT are recyclable and 1.89Â MT are incinerable (Gianoncelli et al., 2013 ). The metallurgical process like refining, smelting, etc. used to extract metals such as silver, cobalt, platinum, zinc, gold, and copper, generates a significant quantity of solid wastes in the form of slag, sludge, dust, dross are recyclable hazardous waste while oily sludge, spent catalyst, chemical sludge, chromium sludge are major hazardous non-recyclable waste. Since this waste are having high toxic content therefore they are hazardous and cause ground and surface water contamination through their percolation from dump/disposal sites. This is lethal for fauna, flora, human health, etc. therefore the necessary arrangement should be made for successfully disposing of the generated waste due to metallurgical activities to attain the objectives as prescribed by the Basel convention. Table 8   shows the various recyclable hazardous wastes with sources of generation.  2.3.2 Generation and utilization of non-ferrous metal wastes There are mainly three different varieties of slag includes electric furnace slag, blast furnace slag, and converter slag. The blast furnace of steel plants generates nearly 11Â MT of slag annually (Shi and Qian, 2000 ). Steel industries generate electric furnace slag while pig iron industry generates blast furnace slag and converter slag. Incorporation of blast furnace slag in cement improves the abrasive resistance and strength of cement. Electric furnace slag comprises the tailing of gold, zinc, iron and copper ore beneficiation is used as concrete filler or fine aggregate in construction industries (Kalyani and Pandey, 2014 ). Convertor slag, which is a ferroalloy waste, can be easily recycled but it has not been extensively however it is recommended as an aggregate in lightweight concrete also these solid waste are used in the manufacturing of Portland cement and super-sulphate cement (Buenrostro et al., 2001 ; Ojedokun, 2011 ).  2.3.3 Solid waste generated from lead, zinc, and copper industries The prime lead producing organization in India are Indian Lead Ltd. and Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZL) with a production capacity of 24,000 tons/year and 65,000 tons/year respectively. Globally secondary sources are responsible for 60% of lead generation (Chen et al., 2020 ; Sharholy and Ahmad, 2008 ). The lead comes from dust and drowses, sheets and pipes, cable sheathing and shoulder, and scrap, while lead-acid battery is the prevalent source of secondary lead. The annual generation of slag in the form of solid waste occurs through zinc-lead smelter is estimated to about 1, 42,000 tons. Currently, a part of the wastes is recycled for recovering metals while the remaining part is disposed of as landfills (Sharholy and Ahmad, 2008 ). The hydro-metallurgical operation added with acid leaching is used to produce 75% of zinc metal on global basis. During leaching process,a huge amount of jarosite is generated in the form of mud which is collected in sealed reservoirs or closed containers to new production units. The presence of toxic substances like Fe, Cd, Zn, S, Pb in jarosite made jarosite lethal. In India, Hindustan Zinc Limited has smelting and mining units with a production capability of 3.49Â MT/year. There are four smelters for the production of zinc that are located in Orissa, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan. Debari zinc smelter unit located in Rajasthan is having a production capacity of 59,000tons of zinc metal annually and the plant generates a huge amount of jarosite as hazardous waste. Japan, Germany, Mexico, Australia, Holland, China, Belgium, Finland, Korea, France, Spain, Argentina, Norway, Yugoslavia, Canada are the major countries for the production of jarosite (Gared and Gaur, 2021 ). Jarosite can be recycled in an environmentally friendly way and an effort to produce substitute material for construction had depicted enticing results (Mymrin and Vaamonde, 1999 ; Pappu et al., 2006 ). The initiatives are being taken to retrieve valuable materials and to convert them into potentially less deleterious substances (Romero and RincÃ³n, 1997 ).  2.3.4 Generation and disposal of solid waste in copper industries Activities like refining copper, smelting, etc. generate a huge amount of waste as slag, sludge, dust, dross, scrap, and sediments. Globally, 50000tons of hazardous waste is exported annually which contains copper in significant proportion (Ilankoon et al., 2018 ). Copper can be suitably recovered from the waste of the copper industry and its classification is based on nature (Physical or chemical), composition, and recycling potential. There are some form of solid waste produced from copper industries that act as a raw material to other industries (N. Gupta, Yadav, & Kumar, 2015 ; Safiuddin et al., 2010 ). Anode slime, anode slag, effluent treatment plant sludge, and convertor slag are some of the secondary sources for copper. Wastes such as reverts, dross, etc. and metallic waste are easily recycled via metallurgical processes like electro-refining, fire refining and melting. Copper slag can be used for granular material, tiles, mine backfill materials (Gorai and Jana, 2003 ).  2.3.5 Generation and utilization of mining waste India is having significant deposits of minerals includes sub-bituminous and bituminous coal, limestone, dolomite, lignite, manganese, gold, diamonds, tin ore, bauxite ore, iron ore, etc. and to contributes 25% of the world's mineral resources. India annually generates about 200Â MT of inorganic solid waste that is non-hazardous (McAllister, 2015 ; Woodard and Milner, 2016 ) such that 40% of it generates from zinc, iron, copper mines, etc. (Arafat et al., 2015 ; T. Gupta, 1998 ). The different states of India include Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Bihar, Rajasthan are prosperous with minerals particularly ferrous and non-ferrous minerals/metals. The beneficiation is carried out after extraction of ore is a grinding and crushing process where chemical or physical separation methods such as amalgamation, electro-winning, electrostatic separation, gravity concentration, precipitation, solvent extraction leaching, magnetic separation and floatation are employed. Beneficiation generates tailing which comes out as slurry with 30â60% as solid and 40â70% as a liquid which is discharged into ponds/impoundments. The primary activities of a mining operation that includes mine water seepage, waste disposal, dump leaches, tailing, etc. act as pollutant hence mining waste management is of great importance in developing countries in which processing and extraction/recycling of minerals are economic. Coal washery operation separates around 50% of material as spoils that are hard rock or colliery shale, which mostly act as road embankment fillers while some of these spoils are being used in the production of lightweight aggregates. Currently, the generated wastes are utilizing and recycled for the production of several building construction materials. Investigation on the probable application of mining tailing in bricks unravelled that fired brick with good quality can be made from the paste of clay and waste generated during coal washing an investigation reveals that with the addition of copper tailing (60%) with clay for making bricks achieves the strength of 190Â kg/cm2  under the firing temperature of 950Â Â°C (Gebremariam et al., 2020 ).  2.3.6 Recycling potential construction debris and marble processing waste In India construction industry contributes to about 14.5Â MT solid waste generation including sand bricks, concrete, bitumen, masonry and gravel, some of which are recycled and used in construction materials such that old building has 25% recycled material while new building has 75% recycled material (Asokan et al., 2005 ; Yin and Wu, 2018 ). The various operations of marble industries like marble grinding, cutting, polishing, etc. produces 6Â MT of waste annually. Rajasthan has 4000 marble mines and is considered as the world's biggest marble deposits contributes to approximately 95% of total marble manufactured in India. Around 70% of marble processing waste is being dumped locally or near the riverbeds (Roy, 2020 ). In windy season air carries these marble dust or powder to the vegetated area which negatively affects the local ecosystem and environment besides reducing the soil fertility by increasing the alkalinity of the soil. Moreover, marble dust also reduces the permeability and porosity of soil that leads to waterlogging efforts thus made the use marble waste in various application as building material like cement, concrete, asphalt aggregates road construction, etc. (Roy, 2020 ).The earlier study on substituted wood polymer composites showed the potential of utilizing nearly 40% of marble cutting waste. The quality of the products was improved when compared to teak wood and particle boards. Investigation shows that marble process residue in road building improves the settlement, reduces the permeability, and enhances consolidation properties (Okagbue and Onyeobi, 1999 ; Shukla et al., 2020 ). Incorporation of marble slurry in jarosite bricks enhances the qualities and also restricts the leaching of hazardous material from jarosite (Rawat). It suggests that industrial waste has huge potential as a substitute for the component being used in construction industries, highway pavement construction.  2.3.7 Generation, utilization, and recycling of non-hazardous inorganic solid wastes The waste generated from coal combustion as residue from the thermal power plant, waste gypsum, and bauxite red mud is the primary source of inorganic non-hazardous solid waste. The following section discusses in detail the source of generation and recycling potential of non-hazardous inorganic solid waste along with their impact on the environment and recycling potentials.  2.3.8 Residues from combustion of coal Coal combustion residues (CCRs) are a cumulative term refers to the residues like boiler slag, bottom ash, fly ash, and other solid particles generated from coal ignition which are ultimately dumped to ash pond. India annually generates 112Â MT of solid waste through thermal power plants which are being used in paints, wasteland development, backfill/road embankments, cement, wood substitutes, bricks, agriculture/soil amelioration, adhesives, concrete, and wallboard. India has coal reserves of about 211 billion tons. In 2020 India produces 260,000Â MW of power, out of which 20,000Â MW will be generated from nuclear power plants while the rest of power was generated from the thermal power plant as a result of which 270Â MT of CCRs is estimated to be generated (Ashoka et al., 2005 ). Thermal power plants generally dump the ashes gathered through electrostatic precipitator or bag filter residues and the unburned carbon settled down at the underside of the boiler collectively as a slurry into the pond where they remain for a longer duration. At present, India utilizes nearly 35% of CCRs while the remaining unutilized CCRs (65% of CCRs) is a big threat to the environment so there is a need for comprehensive economic and environmental investigation along with life cycle-based studies on long term bases to maximize the CCRs utilization.   2.4 Generation, recycling and utilization of bauxite red mud and gypsum waste Bauxite red mud is produced as a by-product during the production of aluminium as the primary product in Bayer's process in which bauxite (an aluminium ore) is treated with caustic soda under condition of high pressure and heat. Bauxite red mud contains iron minerals like magnetite, hematite, and goethite as solid components (L. Li, 2001 ). In India 8.375Â MT Bauxite is processed and results in the generation of 5.5Â MT bauxite red mud. The quantity of red mud produced during extraction of aluminium depends upon characteristics of bauxite, pressure, temperature, and other operating condition in which Bayer's process is executed (L. Y. Li, 1998 ; L. Y. Li and Rutherford, 1996 ; YalÃ§Ä±n and SevinÃ§, 2000 ). Bauxite red mud has high alkalinity thus proper attention must be given to prevent the contamination of groundwater and soil. Red mud can be used as a replacement for ordinary clay for brick production. The mechanical strength was found to decrease with the concentration of red mud also its inertness is maintained at the temperature below 900Â Â°C having carbonate-rich clays. Recycled bauxite red mud can be used for the fabrication of polymeric composite, products containing wood, tiles, bricks, glazes and electro porcelain, porcelain (J. Gupta, Papadikis, Kozhevnikov and Konysheva, 2017 ; Sglavo et al., 2000 ). During production of glazes in corporation of red mud up to 37% brings abrasion resistance high strength and good quality surface finish (YalÃ§Ä±n and SevinÃ§, 2000 ). Red mud addition at the time of high temperature firing at 1050Â Â°C results in the formation of glassy phase with increased flexural strength and density. Investigations had shown that red mud can act as a good adsorbent particularly for adsorption of cd2+ , Zn2+ , Cu2+,  and Ni2+ hence useful for wastewater treatment. The material like sodium carbonate, carbonaceous materials, talc is gas-generating material which when added to red mud produces the lightweight aggregate (Lopez et al., 1998 ). In India6 MT of gypsum waste such as flurogypsum, phosphogypsum is generated annually which can be used to produce plaster (M. Singh, 2002 ). The plaster produced from this waste gypsum possesses enhanced mechanical property with no lethality to human life. The recycled lime sludge and phospho-gypsum have been used for the production of super-sulphate cement, gypsum plaster, partition walls, Portland cement, fibrous gypsum boards, blocks, masonry cement, flooring tiles, and sand-lime bricks (Zhu et al., 2008 ). Phospho-gypsum as ammonium sulphate due to which it acts as a good fertilizing agent. Moreover, for sulphur and calcium deficient soils the phospho-gypsum can act as a good soil conditioning agent (Mashifana, 2019 ).   3 Practices for utilization of solid waste in constructive building materials Investigations were made to improve the flexural capacity of concrete tiles through incorporating fibers of waste PET bottles. The comparisons for the tested properties with normal concrete tiles shows that the addition of 10% and 15% of fibers with concrete improves the property of the floor tiles (Awoyera et al., 2021 ).The trial production of the sheet molding compound found that the mechanical strength of the prepared compound was sufficient to carry a man load (Setyanto, 2014 ). An analysis of the impact of the mineralogical constitution of the prepared raw material for porcelain tile with advancement of macroscopic residual stress and development of imperfection size shows an improvement in mechanical strength with increase of kaolinite thus suggest to maintain the level of quartz less than 25% (Junior et al., 2011 ). Experimental demonstrations were made for making composite materials using dune and recycled High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) with varying proportions of HDPE 30, 40,50,60,70 and 80% by weight of the mixture. The tests were conducted on density, breaking load by flexural an impermeability test. The breaking strength by the flexural of all the composite roof tiles was found below the resistance of clay roof tiles (Seghiri et al., 2017 ). In another experiment, the potential of plastic waste as an incomplete substitution of the fine total in self-compacting concrete (SCC) was investigated. Plastic waste having three different sizes (coarse plastic waste, fine plastic waste, and mixed plastic waste) with six different proportions of plastic waste as 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, and 12.5% were used and established that plastic waste can be utilized as an aggregate in SCC (Hama and Hilal, 2017 ). A simple technique to manufacture LDPE bonded pavers and sand blocks has been invented in which LDPE is first melted then mixed with sand to produce the LDPE bonded pavers and sand blocks. The water absorption, density, and compressive strength of these sand blocks were found to depend upon the sand to plastic ratio and sand particle size. Moreover, the compressive strength and density of the prepared blocks increases with particle size. Also, under optimum condition, a high strength tough LDPE-bonded sand block can be produced which can have compressive strength up to 27Â MPa. The diminished compressive qualities and densities of sand with expanding sand molecule size is because of grid basic changes happening in the plastic-sand as shown in Fig. 6   (a) and changes in the microstructure of LDPE bonded sand is shown in Fig. 6 (b)  (Jnr et al., 2018 ). In another experiment, the potentiality of using electronic waste or e-waste in concrete was investigated (Ilankoon et al., 2018 ). For this experimental investigation (10%, 20%, and 30%) and coarse totals (5%, 10%, and 15%) substitution in fiber-strengthened green cement with 30% of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) for the substitution of cement was taken. It revealed that the use of e-waste with the replacement of coarse aggregate resulted in the development of light-weighted concrete. Fig. 7   shows the microscopic image of the prepared specimen with the incorporation of e-waste in concrete (A. A. Kumar and Selvan, 2017 ). Earlier studies had verified the possibility of incorporating sewage sludge as raw material for ceramics roof tiles. The weight concentrations of the sludge used were 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10%. The absorption was found to increase linearly with sludge whereas load rupture on flexion is decreased. The results showed the use of 4% of sludge as the composition of raw materials in manufacturing of roof tiles has no interference in the properties of the manufactured product this could bring down the requirement of raw material (Ottosen et al., 2020 ). The study demonstrates the utilization of sludge produced during the cutting of stone for the manufacturing of terrazzo tiles. The major components of the sludge were identified by physio-chemical and mineralogical characteristics and transverse strength was found to decrease with an increase in sludge ratio while the values for water absorption increases with sludge ratio. The prepared samples were found to meet the required limit in Jordanian standards i.e. 30Â kg/cm2  (Tuladhar et al., 2020 ). The utilizing of waste plastics of vehicles as a substitute for sand in the concrete building was investigated by impact testing of concrete with 5%, 10%, and 15% of waste plastics in replacement of sand. It was found that the replacement of sand with plastics waste resulted in increased the energy absorption capacity of concrete (Mustafa et al., 2019 ). The ornamental rock cutting waste in the powder form which is used for the production of floor tiles is first drawn in the powdered form and then subjected to uniaxial compression of 50Â MPa followed by sintering at 1190Â Â°C - 1250Â Â°C. The investigation for the dependence of technological properties on firing temperature and waste addition revealed the acceleration of liquid phase formation hence sintering occurred on progressive replacement of Na-feldspar with stone cutting waste which leads to the densification of microstructure. Generally, partly dissolved quartz implanted in glassy matrix and mullite are present in the tile pieces. It was revealed that under lower firing temperature enhanced floor tiles were produced by Na-feldspar's substitution with rock-cutting waste, in the range up to 47.5Â wt% (Souza et al., 2010 ). The conventional building material industry is responsible for 40% of the total emission of greenhouse gases (GHGS). The coal-fired ash (CFA) which is a construction industry waste can be utilized for the manufacturing of eco-friendly roof tiles by using the catalyzed waste engine oil (WEO) as a binder. It was observed that under a certain condition of pressure and temperature the waste engine oil gets chemically transformed from a liquid state to solid-state through a polymerization reaction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to analyze the various functional group present in waste oil that started the chemical reaction which led to the tile's stiffening. To optimize the manufacturing of catalyzed Eco-roofing tiles, several manufacturing processes were investigated. The various test on eco-roofing tiles were carried out to know the permeability, water absorption and flexural strength. Further, the embodied energy (EE) and embodied carbon (EC) of novel tiles were detected to be 1.27Â MJ/kg and 0.4178Â Kg CO2 /Kg respectively which are comparatively lower than that of conventional roofing tiles (Teoh et al., 2018 ). The demonstrations for manufacturing of roof tiles using molten plastics and broken glasses as substitution of cement and fine river sand respectively implies that for hallow plastic block the composition of 33% molten plastic, 11.2% fine glass, 11.2% fine sand and 44.6% course glass gives an optimum compressive strength also with 30% of molten plastic waste and 70% as glass gives better quality roof tile, and composition of 32% molten plastic and 68% glass is preferable for light traffic zone (axle load less than 27Mpa) floor tile (Behera et al., 2018 ). The experimental study for the fabrication of roof tiles using rice husk with replacement of MÂ âÂ sand in different proportions concludes that the replacement of M-sand by rice husk below 7% is having no effect on compressive strength that reduces with further replacement (14%, 21%, 28%, 35%, and 42%) effectively thus economic and environmental benefits occur at 7% of Rice husk ash (Das et al., 2015 ). Ceramic waste concrete is made with waste pieces of tiles with 0%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% as composition. The replacement between 5% and 30% concrete by waste ceramics gives maximum strength to the concrete (Tam and Soomro, 2011 ). The impact of vertical stress and rubber particle content on grain breakage, coefficient of compressibility, actual density, rebound, void ratio, and compression modulus were investigated (Liu et al., 2018 ). The works for replacing feldspar by LCD waste glass as a flux material for developing ceramic tiles was made (Kim et al., 2016 ). The earlier work estimates the influence of accelerated weathering, xenon-arc light, and freeze-thaw cycling on wood plastic composite extruded from recycled plastics (Turku et al., 2018 ). The possibility of making ceramics tiles through ceramics tiles and clay at different sintering temperature had been investigated. The properties of bulk density, firing shrinkage, and water absorption were analyzed, results showed that after sintering in blast furnaces slag and clay mixtures the values of the water absorption and apparent porosity is increases with the proportion of blast furnace slag as shown in Fig. 8  (a and b) (Ozdemir and Yilmaz, 2007 ). Wear generated crystallization of nine different polymers (polyamide 6-PA6, Polyvinylidene fluoride-PVDF, Polyphenylsulphone-PPSU, Polycarbonate-PC, Polyamide-imide-PAI, Polyphenylsulphone PPS, Ultra-high Molecular Weight Polyethylene UHMWPE, Polyethylene terephthalate PET, polyether-imide-PEI) were investigated using the reciprocating tribo-tester (flat-on-flat) under dry condition against 100Cr6 steel counter face under the sliding speed of 5Â mm/s and contact pressure of 4Â MPa. Wear testing enhanced the crystallinity for semi-crystalline grades particularly for PPS and PET. The frictional heating during wear testing modified the morphology of these two materials at contact surface though the temperature generated due to frictional heating was less than the melting range. This enhancement in crystallinity due to wear testing was further affirmed by instrumented indentation test by exhibiting higher spring stiffness/hardness (TÃ³th et al., 2019 ). The frost behaviour of thirteen roof tiles was investigated by performing extensive thaw/freeze testing (EN 539â2) and determining the durability indices. The microstructure was assessed concerning compositional, technological and physical parameters, the obtained results were correlated with roofing tiles frost resistance. Reliable product performance was not obtained from any of the prediction models. To resist the severe climatic condition, the roofing tiles were designed and produced by coupling the compositional variable with microstructure considering the bulk density as the dominant parameter (highest values involved enhanced durability) the designed and manufacturing of roof tiles with good resistance needs the investigation of phase composition, microstructure, compositions of raw materials and processing variables (Raimondo et al., 2009 ). Impact testing of concrete samples containing various proportions (0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) of plastic waste as a substitute for sand replacement was carried out. The load versus displacement analysis for all these specimens under impact and the static load were investigated. It was found that with 20% plastic as a sand replacement the impact toughness of the concrete increased by 39%. Under impact loading these samples showed high energy absorption capacity and strength as compared to that under static loading. Approximately 72% and 109% increment in impact energy under bending was observed in concrete containing 5% and 10% plastic waste as compared to concrete with no plastic waste however 198% decrease in impact energy was seen in concrete containing 20% of plastic waste (Mustafa et al., 2019 ). Moreover, it is known that the area under impact bending load versus displacement graph is equal to fracture energy (NP Banthia, Mindess, & Bentur, 1987 ; N Alam et al., 2021 ). The investigation for chemical composition, particle size, density, particle size distribution, morphology, organic matter content and mineralogical analysis to produce ceramic tile using sugarcane bagasse ash up to 2.5Â wt %shows the possibility of using sugarcane bagasse ash for the development of ceramic floor tile. Fig. 9  (aâd) shows linear shrinkage, apparent density, flexural strength, and water absorption of the prepared specimens. The solid waste phosphor-gypsum (PG) through intermittent pressing hydration process converted to hardened tiles were found to have good mechanical strength. Moreover, the tile's property was found to depend upon total time, frequency, and pressure of intermittent pressing. Fig. 10   shows the behaviour of PG hardened tiles on bending strength and porosity with pressing time (Zhou et al., 2016 ) whereas Fig. 11   (a-d) shows SEM observations of the tiles at 20Â MPa. The earlier study had explored the potential of blended fly-ash clay for roofing tiles to improve the damage resistance of tiles with reduced densities. To achieve these four different composites were fabricated and evaluations were made under a dynamic impact load of 1Â J and further examination is made for the change in microstructure is shown in Fig. 12  (aâd). Fig. 13  (a and b) shows densities and degree of damages, and energy-time response respectively for the prepared specimens (Castellanos et al., 2017 ). The study demonstrates the production of bi-layered ceramic tiles by incorporating sawdust into ceramic tiles. The optical microscopy indicates the complete burning of the sintered discs on the application of fast-firing cycles. The results show a quite decrease in thermal conductivity with the incorporation of sawdust and reduces the weight of the produced by 7.5% with mechanical strength comparable to commercial stoneware tiles. Fig. 14   and Fig. 15   shows distributions of sizes of the pore diameter for incorporation level of 2.5, 5, and 10Â wt % and mechanical properties of the fired bodies respectively (Novais et al., 2015 ). The utilizing of ash as an aggregate in cement through the preplaced and dry-mixing method is investigated. The optical images are shown in Fig. 16  (a and b). The characterizations for the physical and chemical properties were carried out after that the concrete blocks were prepared. It from the experiment result that shows the prepared blocks are having sufficient strength with low density and are economic and environmental (Yoon et al., 2019 ). The prepared cement-based composites with the addition of bamboo cellulosic fiber by varying the weight proportions from 4% to 16%were investigated for flexural strength and impact resistance as shown in Fig. 17  (a and b). The fracture toughness and absorbed energy were found to improve by 2.7â45.9 and 2â24 times respectively. The properties were found to improve with the addition of BF within a certain limit but after a certain content due to fibers agglomeration, no improvement in the properties was noticed. Fig. 18   given below shows Load-deflection curves and Fig. 19   shows the maximum flexural strength and fracture toughness of the specimens with content BF (Xie et al., 2019 ). The demonstrations made to replace coarse natural aggregate showed that the frost resistance of concrete was found to improve with the addition of Coarse Recycled Concrete Aggregate CRCA. The addition of fly-ash improves the workability of concrete and bonding strength (Wei et al., 2019 ). The possibility of utilizing fly ash for making brick was experimentally demonstrated (Wang et al., 2016 ). The influence of the parameters for the fabrication of prepared composite with the incorporation of sugarcane fiber was carried out by using a regression equation showed that the ultimate strength in tension was improved with increased alkali concentration and duration of alkali treatment (Vignesh et al., 2018 ).The study investigates the application of buffing dust for lightweight cement blocks. The results and analysis through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) confirmed the formation of nano-structured fibrous carbon materials. The formation of trivalent chromium to hexavalent chromium was inhabited by the addition of iron particles this makes it light in weight. Fig. 20  (aâd) shows the SEM and X-ray diffraction XRD with treated with iron particles and without iron particles. The strength in the compression of cement block with iron particles was found more than cement blocks without iron nanoparticles (Sivaprakash et al., 2017 ). The recycling of waste thermoset as a building material was carried out. The flexural strength and toughness were found to improve with the addition of 5% scrapped thermoset to conventional cement (Saccani et al., 2019 ). The replacement of coarse aggregate with e-waste was investigated. The reduction in dry density and high deformability was observed. The replacement up to 30% is recommended for achieving strength of M25 concrete and the replacement of 40 and 50% is suitable for non-structural elements thus the investigation limits the use for e-waste as coarse aggregate (K. S. Kumar and Baskar, 2015 ). The study investigates the possibility of replacing cement with slag produced from the iron and steel industry. The results found a decrease in the water requirement and setting time of cement with slag replacement. The study of microstructure through SEM shows a denser structure of ternary mortars and proves economic and sustainable (Palod et al., 2019 ). The reviews on the state of Stone Cutting and Fabrication Industries (SCFIs) reports that almost 35â52.5% of the raw stones were converted to solid waste and techniques for a sustainable development besides examining the opportunities for effective management (Mosaferi et al., 2014 ). The study examines the industrial, construction municipal solid waste for the production of composite fiber (Keskisaari and KÃ¤rki, 2017 ). The survey was made for the activation of rice husk and its various engineering applications (Nguyen et al., 2019 ). The review for the application of copper slag shows an optimum replacement with copper slag enhances the properties of concrete with long-term durability. The concrete was found safe to use as filling materials, pavements and roadbeds (Murari et al., 2015 ). The leaching of different metals like shows fly ash to meet the standards of non-hazardous waste (Y. Li, Li et al., 2014 ). The examination of microstructure properties of rubberized asphalt and cement-based composites showed that the properties of asphalt are improved by adding waste rubber and adhesive bonding influences the properties significantly that increases with the pre-treatment process (Karakurt, 2015 ). The investigation for the addition of steel and glass fiber on the compressive and flexural behaviour showed an improvement in flexural stress-deflection response as shown in Fig. 21  (a and b) (Gwon et al., 2019 ). The investigation for the possibility of using Copper Mine Tailings (CMT) as an alternative for cement in concrete shows the success of replacement cement by CMT in concrete. The mechanical properties were found to be influenced significantly with partial replacement of CMT. The Micro-structural investigation via SEM microscopy for (CMT) and cement paste suggests as shown in Fig. 22  (a and b) and Fig. 23   respectively (Esmaeili and Aslani, 2019 ). To assess the possibility of using slag generated during the pyro-metallurgical processing of lead ore, complex characterizations were carried out (Buzatu et al., 2015 ). The recycling of waste electric and electronic equipment was analyzed (Buekens and Yang, 2014 ). The recycling potential of the stone cutting slurry was investigated with replacements. The measurement of parameters for concrete and mortar characteristics suggests the feasibility of reusing slurry sludge for the production of concrete and mortar (Al-Zboon & Al-Zou'by, 2015 ). Composite was prepared using domestic waste containing organic compounds using hot pressing and parameters were tested. The composite was found to have good properties of fire-resistant with strength comparable to wood building materials as illustrated in Fig. 24   (Surtiyeni et al., 2016 ). The feasibility of a dual-waste plastic recycling system that offers to recycle fiber-reinforced plastic plastics to recyclable material and plastics to fuels which reduces the requirement of the landfill was confirmed (D'antino & Papanicolaou, 2018 ). The properties of the composite prepared by incorporation date palm fiber at 40%, 50%, and 60% by weight were evaluated by hand lay-up technique. The flexural strength and modulus were found to increases at 50% of DPF as shown in Fig. 25   and Fig. 26   respectively. The Thermal Gas Analyzer (TGA) results showed an improvement in the thermal stability and residual content with the reinforcement of DPF in epoxy composites. Moreover, the damping was found to decrease considerably and is lowest with 50% of date palm fiber as shown in Fig. 27   (Gheith et al., 2019 ). The literature studies reveal that the reduction or minimization of the generated solid waste is a primary approach to for management of solid waste next to this reuse, recycle, and utilization of generated waste as raw materials for the manufacturing of a product is the second priority to avoid the disposal as waste. The recycling of waste products for manufacturing or applications as building materials is an interesting practice for managing solid wastes. Moreover, recycling or utilizing the generated waste is quite potential to save the environment from the widespread problem of solid waste besides, saving the available resources, improves human health conditions and increases the economy and generating employment in the waste management sector. The success of recycling systems rests on the careful consideration of the cost involved and market potential for the manufactured product. Recycling provides employment opportunities even to those who cannot manage in the formal sectors. The results of successful recycling can be estimates through reduction in quantities of disposed waste and reversal of materials back to the economy. The recycling rate is estimated as a function of local initiatives, state initiatives, and characteristics of residents and the attribute of location.  4 Minimization and management of municipal solid waste The optimal solution for effective waste management is associated with minimizing the generation and disposal of waste that concerns the environmental problem and favors the interest of public health. Effective planning and development of strategies for the categorization of generated waste are important for the successful management of municipal solid waste. Moreover, there exists variation in attitudes and behaviour of people towards the practice of waste management and lack of awareness for handling the solid waste as a result despite of various approaches available for the management of solid waste there doesn't exist a single practice that can be generally applied to cope with the difficulty of managing solid waste therefore an integrated waste management approach is considered as one of the approaches for successful management of municipal solid waste. Reduce, reuse, recycling, incineration and landfilling of the solid waste are considered as the components of integrated waste management as shown in Fig. 28   among these components recycling utilizes a considerable quantity of waste as raw material for developing fresh products. Integrated Waste Management (IWM) is compatible with sustainable development is economic and environment friendly. Fig. 29   given below represents the hierarchy of IWM where the waste reduction covers the top level of the hierarch and is most desirable that suggests using less in begin and reusing more while landfilling is least favorable as the regulation of Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendment (HSWA) prohibits disposal of wastes that are ignitable, reactive, corrosive, and toxic. The integrated waste management was developed with the strategy to recognize the level that recovers the optimum values of the material (Chi et al., 2015 ; Ikhlayel et al., 2016 ). The success of the approach can be justified by reduction the requirement of raw materials and costs of disposal as well as saving in energy inputs. However, mismatching between waste composition and process specifications limits the opportunities of the approach (V. Srivastava et al., 2015 ). The study of municipal solid waste is the key to solve the environmental problem and is crucial to achieving a sustainable society. The success of any waste management system depends on the extent of solving the environmental problem. The municipalities are in charge of handling the overall practices of municipal waste management systems. Fig. 30   shows the relation among the municipalities, households, and contractors with stages of waste collection for the management of solid waste.  5 Challenges and issues in waste management The growing rate of waste generation, inadequate practices for waste collection, logistic or transportation problems, ineffective waste treatment and improper disposal of solid waste are the challenges associated with the primary aspects of Solid Waste Management (MSW) (Chung and Lo, 2003 ; Noor et al., 2021 ; Kucukvar et al., 2016 ; Zhao et al., 2010 ) . The practice of recycling and utilizing solid waste as raw for developing building materials are the sustainable approaches towards effective management of generated solid waste. The conventional practice of dumping solid waste as landfills is uneconomical and creating a serious problem to the environment and public health and requires a shift towards waste management systems in such a way that valuable resources will retain within the economy. This section discusses the challenges and issues associated with the management of solid waste. 5.1 Attitude and behaviour gap The meaning of waste varies individually as for the community involved in the practices of picking wastes it is a source of wealth or means of their livelihood while for the majority of peoples waste is considered as a major problem and needs to be addressed. The attitude and behaviour are influences by several factors including lack of awareness and education of effective waste management, inadequate public participation, ineffective waste management techniques, and social norms. The gap is creating a discrepancy among the public concern regarding hazardous to the environment posed by generated waste. In the majority of the developing countries, the presence of littering and throwing of garbage in open indicates an irresponsible behaviour associated with the mismanagement of solid waste. The lack of social pressure, absence of realistic penalties, or consistent enforcement, inadequate concern towards the environment are the causes for such irresponsible behaviour. A range of regional and culture-dependent factors can affect public attitudes towards waste.  5.2 Lack of education and awareness The lack of education and awareness among the public for the practices of solid waste management is a challenging factor. It was found for most of the developing countries that even the citizens are aware of recycling and techniques of utilizing solid waste but there is a lack of participation in pro-environmental activities. It appears that they have not embraced waste management reforms. The lack of interest and responsibility for protecting the environment and safe disposal of solid waste produces communities with little concern for the environment. The addition of new ideas to prior knowledge of waste management could bring communities attention to innovative practices of managing wastes. To promote citizenship among the community that concern over environmental problems and sustainable waste management systems requires public awareness. The measures to overcome the challenges require rising the conscience of the individual needs and concern with environmental awareness and sustainable practices.  5.3 Budgetary constraints Like other developing countries, India too is having budgetary constraints and suffers from the problem of limited resources and funds. Moreover, the available budget are not managed properly. The opportunities for development of systems and techniques of sustainable solid waste management were found to be limited due to limited government budget and proper collection of waste is overlooked. The municipalities are facing the problem to achieve an effective and economical way of managing solid waste. A major part of the allotted funds for waste management is paid to the untrained or overstaffed workers instead of improving infrastructure for recycling and utilizing the waste in addition to this inadequacy of logistics, supervisors, and waste collector are the obstacles for management of solid waste in the country.  5.4 Inadequate service and operational inefficiencies The inadequate service coverage and operational inefficiencies are the problems faced by municipalities for waste management services in developing countries. Due to financial cries and insufficient resources the urban areas are not getting advantages of the various waste collection schemes implemented by municipalities in developing countries. In most of the affluent areas the resources are often centralized as the manpower is insufficient to cover entire cities. The considerable distance between residential areas and inaccessible roads are the problems for inadequate services of waste management. Most of the developing countries are lack skilled human resources and suffer from poor management of available resources that are liable for the mismanagement of the generated solid waste. The location and convenience of the available resources are responsible for implementing any waste recycling practice.  5.5 Lack of effective technologies and equipment Ineffective technologies and equipment are the causes of inadequate service coverage and operational inefficiencies of sustainable waste management. Many sources of waste are inaccessible due to unplanned settlements, congestion and elevation this affects the selection of equipment. The waste services and trash bins are not maintained properly. The misuse of technology in developing countries is another major constraint that fails expensive and sophisticated technologies for recycling and other waste management systems. The occurrence of breakdown failure due to the adoption of inappropriate technology and unskilled persons are either expensive to replace and difficult to maintain are common for developing countries. The absence of effective plans for the management of solid waste at the local and national levels results in the emergence of solid waste technologies without any attention to their suitability in the overall management of solid waste.  5.6 Inadequate practice of landfill disposal There exists a lack of proper disposal sites for the dumping of the generated waste. The significant quantity of generated solid waste is dumped as landfill in an unprotected manner thus creating a serious problem to the environmental health and creating infrastructural challenges. Developing countries are found to have jeopardized residential development around the landfill areas. The landfills are situated at a considerable distance from communities creating more financial constraints whereas the developing countries confront the problem due to the exponentially growing population and puts a limit on the location of future landfills. Thus, the development of practices for recycling of waste and its utilization are the tools to overcome the problems.  5.7 Limited implementation of waste reduction activities The limited adoption of recycling activities is creating a hindrance to sustainable waste management as a result the developing world suffers from the infrastructural constraints on waste management systems. Many times, the recycling programs introduced to the public through NGOs or local waste management authorities are found to be unsupportable due to poor participation by community members.  5.8 Waste generation Rapidly growing population, urbanization, and industrialization are some of the causes of the increasing rate of waste generation. It is estimated that the rate of generation for municipal solid waste will be approximately 6.1 million metric tons/day in 2025 (A. Kumar and Agrawal, 2020 ; A. Singh and Basak, 2018 ). The quality of waste generation is found to depend on the socio-economic-environmental condition of a nation. However, the developed countries are having the technologies for recovering energy from waste and utilizing waste for developing the new product while in developing countries collection, logistics, awareness and disposal of wastes are problems for effective waste management ( Troschinetz, 2005 ).   6 Governance structure for solid waste management The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) established in 1985 is the nodal organization in the regulatory structure of the central government for solid waste management. The central and state pollution control boards work in coordination for arranging, advancement, coordination and regulating the execution of India's natural and forestry service and projects. For effective management of the generated solid waste various rules are framed under Environment Protection Act-1986. As per the constitution of India, waste management comes under the state list due to its local thus making Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) answerable for the successful management of solid waste. The industrially generated hazardous waste is managed under Hazardous Waste Management Rules, 2008with resulting changes in 2009 and follows a system concerning the Municipal Solid Waste Management. In India, the municipal solid waste is managed at multiple tires includes urban local bodies, state government, and central government. The primary action at the field level is performed by local bodies whereas the state and the central government provide financial support for framing policy. Fig. 31   shows the administrative structure for municipal waste management in India and is discussed as: 6.1 Central government The central government provides financial support and is responsible for framing policies, makes rules and regulations and preparing guidelines for effective management of waste. It also supports state and local bodies for implementing the improved practices of waste management. The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) are involved in Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) as per the Solid Waste Management rule, 2016. The MoEFCC monitors the execution of the Municipal Solid Waste rules in India while MoUD is responsible for coordinating the administration with state government and Union territory to monitor the practices adopted for the management of solid waste, executing the projects funded, formulation of policies and strategies for solid waste management. It also promotes research and training to the local bodies for improving the practice of managing solid waste. The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), Ministry of Chemical and Fertilizers, Ministry of New and Renewal Energy (MNRE) and Ministry of Power are the other agencies that come within the structure of the central government for facilitating and assisting for the environment, energy, and infrastructure.  6.2 State (provincial) government The function of state governments is to coordinate local government and organization with the central and ensure implementation of rules and provisions set by the central government to local bodies working in the sectors sector of municipal waste management. Besides this the state government makes policies and strategies for the state in consultation with local stakeholders for managing waste. The Department of Urban Development monitors the management of municipal solid waste at the state level.  6.3 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) Urban local bodies are legal owners of waste for the collection of waste in an authorized area. The Municipal Solid Waste Rule 2016 and 2000 directs the local bodies of urban areas for establishing an effective waste management system and presents an annual report to State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committee (s). ULBs are responsible for the provision of services of collecting and disposal of waste. These bodies also establish for collection of waste at doorstep, and segregation of waste, facilities for waste - processing, recovery of material and energy, the setting of waste collection facilities, transporting, and disposal. Further, Non-government organization (NGO) and private sectors also work in agreement with municipalities under the terms and conditions and provide services for municipal solid waste management by developing infrastructure from collecting to disposal of waste efficiently and cost-effectively. NGO acts as a communication bridge between the private and governmental realms in promoting awareness program and understand the existing difficulties, gaps, and challenges within communities.  6.4 Development of approaches for management of municipal waste in India The increasing volume and varieties of generated municipal solid waste has arisen the concerns for economic viability and environmental friendly waste management technologies thus creating a problem for policymakers in the sectors of waste management to device an appropriate waste treatment strategy (Taylor, 2000 ) . As it is known that history matters for understanding the development in policy. This section discusses the evolution of policies and approaches for the management of waste in India thus provides an understanding of the interaction between people and society thereby assists in identifying the need for policies and its possible outcomes. The three phases with different goals concentrate on public health and sanitation, protection of the environment, and management of municipal solid waste. 6.4.1 Phase I: public health and sanitation (1950â1980) Till late 1980, the significant activity for the management of municipal solid waste in India was driven from the viewpoint of Public Health and Sanitation. The planning commission well known as Niti Aayog focused on the eradication of communicable diseases in India (Finnveden et al., 2013 ; S. Kumar, 2011 ). Therefore, the government's aims under Public Health Care and Sanitation were to provide safe drinking waste and sterile removal of waste. After the passing of the first two national 5 years, it was during the third five-year plan when the government motivated the compositing of Municipal solid waste in the civic settlement but fails to meet the expectations due to lack of proper.  6.4.2 Phase II: environmental safety The year 1980â2000 focused to adopt measures for controlling environmental pollution. The Bhopal Gas tragedy in December 1984 drew attention towards casualties due to toxic substances. Later, the Ministry of Forest and Environment passes the Environment Protection Act 1986, under this act, the hazardous waste rules, followed by biomedical waste handling rules in 1989. Later, in the year 1998 rules were established to reduce the natural wellbeing dangers. Meanwhile, in mid-1998, the incident of sporadic expansion of the plague in Surat led to realize that ineffective management of solid waste as the major cause of the plague. In the year 1995 Bajaj Committee was formed and several recommendations were made included integration of waste pickers, collection of waste at doorstep, the evolution of recovery centers, developing recycling units, compositing, and imposing charges for collecting wastes. The Municipal Solid waste acts mandated to manage of MSW and instructed the state government to ensure the execution of solid waste management and handling rule 2000.  6.4.3 Phase III: waste management and climatic change (2000âonwards) The waste management with environment safety was taken as the primary objective of the government from 1980s to 1990s. As per the report on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emission of methane (CH4 ) due to landfill accounts for 3â19% of the global manmade sources (Suchada et al., 2003 ) . National Environmental policy in the year 2006, emerges from various disciplines aims at conserving environment resource and formation of approaches, projects, and ventures for the socio-economic progress of the nation besides, focusing on recycling and strategies for reducing waste.  6.4.4 National urban sanitation policy (2008) This policy aims to remove open defecation and covers the aspects of urban sanitation. The policy was prepared by CPHEEO and MoUD for promoting waster, sanitation, and drainage utilities in India.  6.4.5 National action plan for Climate Change (2009) The Plan was implemented by eight mission of national action plan and work on climatic variation. The goal of the sustainable domain suggests making improvements in public transport, energy efficiency, and effective solid waste management.  6.4.6 Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM, 2014) The Indian government had begun the Swachh Bharat Mission in 2014 intending to eliminate open defecation, develop modern and scientific waste management techniques and eradicating of manual scavenging. The Swachh Bharat Mission had an emphasis on scientific municipal solid waste management (MSWM) and providing scope for modern technological intervention thus bring a change in perspective in the development of Indian Municipal Solid Waste Management. Later, keeping the objective of SBM in view âSolid Waste Management Rules, 2016 was enforced that suggests urban local bodies to adopt a planning process for the formation, execution and revision, MSWM plans.    7 A seven step approach for solid waste management plan Effective solid waste management is a function of municipal thus the municipal authorities require an effective management of solid waste. To achieve this requires systematic development of the MSWM system. Urban local bodies should include the assessment of required tools, processing, transporting and disposal facilities. It is essential to advance a Municipal Solid Waste Management plan under the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, the strategy and policy of the state on MSWM and the State Sanitation Strategy (SSS) developed under the NUSP. Fig. 32   shows a seven-step approach for the solid waste management plan.  8 Socio-economic-environmental impact of utilizing solid waste Sustainable Solid Waste Management (SSWM) can be attained by pollution abatement, saving resources and energy and imparting benefits to society. The utilization of solid waste as a resource for the development of constructive material can significantly achieve economic sustainability by the generation of secondary material in a cost-effective manner besides providing an opportunity for the setting of new enterprises thus generating employment opportunities. The practices of recycling and utilizing solid waste for construction minimizes the cost for the disposal of solid waste. Safe and healthy working conditions in the sector of waste management achieve social sustainability. Social factors like the prohibition of child labour, protection and freedom of association contribute to social development. The successful recycling and utilization of solid waste achieve environmental sustainability. The manufacturing sectors should promote to development of non-hazardous materials with required workability that produces minimum waste as its end product to ensure green manufacturing. Moreover, the implementation of waste prevention strategies through the consumer side promotes sustainable consumption. Thus, the recycling of solid waste will significantly contribute to the socio-economic- environmental development of a nation as it provides employment, reduction of GHG emission enables energy production and improves public health. Fig. 33   is given below green economy pillars with associated benefits. The benefits associated with the green economy are discussed in detail as: 8.1 Economic benefits The waste management sector contribute towards job creation, earn income by manufacturing units thus having potential for improving the economy of the nation. The municipal waste management sector covers the largest single budget, and a major portion of the workers are engaged for activities of solid waste management. The waste management sectors are required to change the conventional practices of waste management for promotion of elements of integrated waste management includes a promotion for waste reduction, reuse, recycling, and recovery which results in economic benefit and depletion of the global resource. The value of physical assets can be achieved through an integrated and sustainable waste management approach. Many new services, products and systems in different sectors such as manufacturing, industry, agriculture, transportation, construction, and processing can be achieved through investment in solid waste management. The economic benefit plays a pivotal role in economic development, contributes to reducing poverty and addresses the needs of the countries through non-discriminatory international funds thus establishes the partnership for sustainable development across the globe.  8.2 Employment generation The approach of developing building material through solid waste generates employment for the successful development of a new practice of solid waste management. Through scavenging in developing countries more jobs will create thus reduces poverty by providing productive employment and decent work for different sectors of workers. The adequate knowledge of newly adopted MSW management techniques provides opportunities for the informal sector to involve in widely varying practices of utilizing waste material. The new job role generation will bring a more skilled pool of laborers that are considered value addition for a country.  8.3 Upcycling of waste products Upcycling is the transformation or modification of discarded products creatively to develop new products with enhanced quality or value towards the upper end of the innovation scale. The upcycling is beneficial for creating more job opportunities compared to landfill disposal and incineration of waste.  8.4 Improves human health The poor practices of waste collection, dumping waste in open sites, burning of the waste directly in the atmosphere and improper disposal of waste creates hazards to human health besides creating the problem to the environment and water bodies. The prevention of solid waste from open dumping can be done by using the generated waste directly or indirectly as a resource material that will be effective for improving the health conditions of the workers as well as other human beings by maintaining a clean atmosphere. Forunderstanding the environmental performance of products requires quantification of carbon-di-oxide and methane emissions associated with landfills and assessment of the life cycle. The research on incineration and better energy recovery systems should be encouraged to reduce the emission of toxic bye products and to promote better health conditions.  8.5 Energy saving A significant part of the energy can be saved through the utilization of solid waste as materials for building applications. The energy that can be saved through municipal solid waste components varies differently with regions across the globe. The successful recycling or utilization of solid as a source of raw material will have significant economic impacts. It is estimated that approximately 28% of the total resources are utilized for developing building materials. It is reported that the manufacturing of cement requires approximately 5â8Â MJ/kg of energy while clay bricks and tiles require 2â7Â MJ/kg of energy. Further, 30% of energy can be saved by the addition of 25% of fly ash or 40% of blast furnace slag in Portland-pozzolana. A similar study reports that 15% of the energy required for burnt clay bricks, can be saved with the incorporation of 25% of flay ash with clay soil (Shukla et al., 2020 ). Moreover, the use of rice husk and groundnut for making particleboard saves about 20% of energy. The agro-industrial wastes like asbestos fiber, timber, and mica could be an alternative material for various building materials and save a significant amount of energy. Thus, it suggests the solid wastes are having quite potential for developing various building materials besides saving energy.   9 Conclusions The increasing rate of solid waste generation is noticeably a worldwide environmental concern. This review explores the recycling potential of solid for successful building material. It is from the literature that various characterization techniques are extremely vital for recycling material into a successful product. The method of utilizing solid waste in construction industries reduces the requirement for raw material besides providing a solution to environmental hazards caused by the disposal of wastes. It reduces overburden on natural resources and maximizes the economic and technical aspects of municipal solid waste. Moreover, analysing the studies in terms of collected data, research gap, scope and limitations, and critical indicators employed assessed the adaptability of developed methods regarding the recycling potential of solid waste as materials for building applications. In particular, the study found that:1. Growing population, urbanization, industrialization, etc. are the causes for rapidly increasing rate of the waste generation thus creating socio-economic and environmental problems. The global data had showed an urgent need for strategies to treat the increasing rate of MSW generation.  2. The volume and characteristic of generated waste vary with regions thus there doesn't exist any waste to energy conversion technology that is feasible for every kind of waste treatment. The review suggests the adoption of one of the elements of Integrated Waste Management i.e., recycling, for management of solid waste and examines recycling of the solid waste for building construction as a viable approach for solid waste management.  3. There exists a gap in altitude and behaviour for waste management among the different communities of the globe and identifies lack of education, awareness for waste management, economic obstruction, insufficient service, operational inadequacy, and lack of practices for reducing waste at the source.  4. The development of practices and technologies of utilizing municipal solid waste as building materials generates employment, provides an opportunity to earn a livelihood and reduces the cost of building construction and requirement of raw materials besides improving the health of the public and environment thus contributes for socio-eco-environmental development.  5. The local authorities should ensure for proper execution of the regulation and policies framed by the ministry working in the demesne of environment and waste management.  6. The literature studies show that significant demonstrations had been made by the researchers, but they are rarely adopted by the communities due to certain constraints.  7. It is possible to utilize solid waste as raw material for construction building materials, also with the combined effort of government and the public can mitigate the problem of generated solid waste besides providing newer materials for construction that would result in green construction.
