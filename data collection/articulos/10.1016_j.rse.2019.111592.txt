                  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.1.1 proposes to quantify “Forest area as a proportion of total land area” in order to achieve SDG target 15.1. While area under forest cover can provide useful information regarding discrete changes in forest cover, it does not provide any insight on subtle changes within the broad vegetation class, e.g. forest degradation. Continental or national-level studies, mostly utilizing coarse-scale satellite data, are likely to fail in capturing these changes due to the fine spatial and long temporal characteristics of forest degradation. Yet, these long-term changes affect forest structure, composition and function, thus ultimately limiting successful implementation of SDG targets.
                  Using a multi-scale, satellite-based monitoring approach, our goal is to provide an easy-to-implement reporting framework for South Asian forest ecosystems. We systematically analyze freely available remote sensing assets on Google Earth Engine for monitoring degradation and evaluate the potential of multiple satellite data with different spatial resolutions for reporting forest degradation. Taking a broad-brush approach in step 1, we calculate vegetation trends in six south Asian countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during 2000–2016. We also calculate rainfall trends in these countries using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) rainfall data, and further calculate Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE) that shows vegetation trends in the context of rainfall variability. In step 2, we focus on two protected area test cases from India and Sri Lanka for evaluating the potential of finer-resolution satellite data compared to MODIS, i.e. Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data, for capturing forest degradation signals, which will ultimately contribute towards SDG indicators 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. We find that most countries show a fluctuating trend in vegetation condition over the years, along with localized greening and browning. The Random Forest (RF) classifier utilized in step 2 was able to generate accurate maps (87% and 91% overall accuracy for Indian and Sri Lankan test cases, respectively) of non-intact forest within the protected areas. We find that almost one-third of the Indian test case is degraded forest, even though it shows overall greening as per the broad-brush approach. This finding corroborates our argument that utilizing higher-resolution satellite data (e.g. 10-m) than those normally used for national-level studies will be crucial for reporting SDG indicator 15.2.1: “progress towards sustainable forest management”.

Department of Geography and Spatial Sciences University of Delaware Newark DE 19716 United States of America       Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.1.1 proposes to quantify “Forest area as a proportion of total land area ” in order to achieve SDG target 15.1. While area under forest cover can provide useful information regarding discrete changes in forest cover, it does not provide any insight on subtle changes within the broad vegetation class, e.g. forest degradation. Continental or national-level studies, mostly utilizing coarse-scale satellite data, are likely to fail in capturing these changes due to the fine spatial and long temporal characteristics of forest degradation. Yet, these long-term changes affect forest structure, composition and function, thus ultimately limiting successful implementation of SDG targets. Using a multi-scale, satellite-based monitoring approach, our goal is to provide an easy-to-implement reporting framework for South Asian forest ecosystems. We systematically analyze freely available remote sensing assets on Google Earth Engine for monitoring degradation and evaluate the potential of multiple satellite data with different spatial resolutions for reporting forest degradation. Taking a broad-brush approach in step 1, we calculate vegetation trends in six south Asian countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during 2000–2016. We also calculate rainfall trends in these countries using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) rainfall data, and further calculate Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE) that shows vegetation trends in the context of rainfall variability. In step 2, we focus on two protected area test cases from India and Sri Lanka for evaluating the potential of finer-resolution satellite data compared to MODIS, i.e. Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data, for capturing forest degradation signals, which will ultimately contribute towards SDG indicators 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. We find that most countries show a fluctuating trend in vegetation condition over the years, along with localized greening and browning. The Random Forest (RF) classifier utilized in step 2 was able to generate accurate maps (87% and 91% overall accuracy for Indian and Sri Lankan test cases, respectively) of non-intact forest within the protected areas. We find that almost one-third of the Indian test case is degraded forest, even though it shows overall greening as per the broad-brush approach. This finding corroborates our argument that utilizing higher-resolution satellite data (e.g. 10-m) than those normally used for national-level studies will be crucial for reporting SDG indicator 15.2.1: “progress towards sustainable forest management ”.   Keywords SDG indicator  Forest degradation  Climate  Rain-Use Efficiency  MODIS  Landsat  Sentinel  CHIRPS  Google Earth Engine  Protected area  Asia    1 Introduction The growing population and rapid development in South Asia – spanning Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka for this study – puts acute pressures on its landscape. Currently, many of these countries produce enough food to be largely self-sufficient and regional economies have experienced some of the highest global growth rates (FAO, IFAD and WFP, 2015 ; FAO, 2017 ). But this development has come at the expense of protected land areas, biodiversity, and soil fertility – all of which may compromise key ecosystem services for future health and livelihood provisioning (Gomiero, 2016 ; Tilman et al., 2002 ). Complicating this matter are the risks and challenges associated with increasing climate change and variability, including rainfall changes, increasing CO2 , drought, and heat extremes, which may further compound the existing biosphere pressures, leading to additional modifications in both managed landscapes and natural ecosystem functioning (Ciais et al., 2005 ; Cramer et al., 2001 ; Cremonese et al., 2017 ; Geddes et al., 2014 ; Keeling et al., 1996 ; Myneni et al., 1997 ; Notaro et al., 2007 ; Sitch et al., 2008 ; von Buttlar et al., 2018 ). Despite these risks, important gaps still exist in quantifying and monitoring the degradation of forests and natural ecosystems across South Asia (Clark et al., 2013 ). There is thus a need for improved metrics and predictors for capturing forest degradation in order to monitor progress on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 “Life on Land” and, ensure the sustainable use and regeneration of terrestrial ecosystems across South Asia. Recent studies leveraging remotely sensed data products and dynamic ecosystem models highlight the emergent finding that the Earth may be “greening” due to enhanced net primary productivity (NPP) (Mao et al., 2016 ; X. Wang et al., 2017 ; Zeng et al., 2017 ; Zhu et al., 2016 ). These greening trends also extend across the South Asian domain, particularly over the last several decades (de Jong et al., 2013b ; X. Wang et al., 2017 ; Zeng et al., 2017 ) despite widespread deforestation and land conversions, intensive agriculture, losses in soil fertility (Lal, 2010 ), and late 20th century declining rainfall trends (Roxy et al., 2015 ; X. Wang et al., 2017 ). Previous studies have attributed this greening mainly to human (agricultural) land management (Chen et al., 2019 ; Jeyaseelan et al., 2007 ; X. Wang et al., 2017 ), inclusive of nitrogen-based fertilizer applications and the copious amounts of irrigation water added to the surface, a large portion of which is supplied from groundwater stores across South Asia (Z. Wang et al., 2017 ). Simple observations of greening and browning trends on the South Asian land surface, however, might obscure important dynamics occurring in natural ecosystems and protected areas (PA). Prior studies have suggested using indicators that combine vegetation data and rainfall data to tease apart climate influences from anthropogenic influences on vegetation trends. One such indicator is Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE)-adjusted vegetation signal, where regions experiencing either faster declining trends in vegetation compared to rainfall or declining trends in vegetation despite increasing rainfall are identified as degraded lands (Bai and Dent, 2009 ; Bai et al., 2012 ). While such indicators can be a useful first-step, we argue that additional fine-scale analyses are required for accurately monitoring SDG targets, and ultimately achieve sustainability goals. SDG indicator 15.1.1 proposes to quantify “Forest area as a proportion of total land area ” in order to achieve SDG target 15.1: “By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests , wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.” Although ‘forest area’ can provide useful information regarding discrete changes in forest cover, it does not provide any insight on subtle within-class changes. Furthermore, while forest degradation is generally defined as “the reduction of the capacity of a forest to provide goods and services ” (FAO, 2010 ), monitoring and quantifying degradation has remained elusive despite significant advances in remote sensing of surface conditions (Nepstad et al., 1999 ; Souza et al., 2005a, 2005b ). One issue with forest degradation monitoring is that the scale of this process differs based on regional context, and hence should be examined separately in different ecological settings. Long-term negative change in forest health can also be considered a form of degradation, including but not limited to, forest thinning, change/reduction in species diversity, and effects of disease or fire (Thompson et al., 2013 ). In many South Asian countries, fine-scale modifications within forest cover are prevalent, largely due to grazing, non-timber forest product (NTFP) collection, and non-continuous linear clearing from foot paths (Davidar et al., 2010 ; Imai et al., 2018 ; Miettinen et al., 2014 ; Shahabuddin and Prasad, 2004 ). Large to moderate-scale studies often fail to capture such fine-scale changes that occur over long time periods, but these can substantially affect forest structure, composition and function, and thus ultimately limit successful implementation of SDG targets. However, the acceptable scale for reporting regional forest degradation in the context of the SDGs is not clear. National-level SDG reporting is further complicated by the spatial scale of the data sets used. For long-term vegetation monitoring over a large geographic region, preferred data sets include the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Hansen et al., 2000 ; Wang et al., 2014 ; Yu et al., 2013 ; Zhan et al., 2000 ). With significant advances in local computing power, data storage, and cloud computing over the last decade, more national and/or global studies have been using moderate-resolution satellite data such as Landsat 8 along with higher-resolution data such as Sentinel-2 (Hansen et al., 2013 ; Korhonen et al., 2017 ; Meroni et al., 2017 ; Potapov et al., 2015 ; Sothe et al., 2017 ). However, capturing the spectral signature for a process with such varied spatial and temporal scales remains challenging. Using a satellite-based monitoring approach, our goal is to provide an easily implementable reporting framework for South Asian forest ecosystem. We systematically analyze available remote sensing assets for monitoring degradation leading to a comprehensive understanding of the different spatial scales for reporting forest degradation. Taking a broad-brush approach in step 1, we calculate trends in LP-DAAC's MODIS data for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; rescaled to 1 km) during 2000–2016 in the context of weather variability, by combining NDVI data with the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Rainfall with Station (CHIRPS) rainfall trends over the same time-period. In step 2, we select two PA test cases to evaluate the potential of finer-resolution satellite data compared to MODIS, i.e. Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data, to capture forest degradation signals, thereby improving monitoring of SDG indicators 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. By focusing on a much finer resolution (10-, 15-, or 30-m) compared to step 1, one of our primary goals is to identify the appropriate scale for reporting degradation patterns. In doing so, we provide a consistent and standardized method towards reporting SDG indicator 15.2.1: “progress towards sustainable forest management ”. Specifically, we investigate the following questions:1. How has natural vegetation, specifically forest cover, changed in South Asia since 2000, especially in the context of rainfall variability?  2. What is the appropriate scale for reporting forest degradation (defined as changes in forest structure and condition due to natural or human activities)?     2 Study area The six countries targeted for this study (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) cover approximately 4.1 million km2  land area (~3% of global land area), and host over 23% of world population. The study area hosts a range of forest cover types, from evergreen/deciduous broadleaf forest in the north-eastern part of India and Bhutan to mostly natural vegetation-cropland mosaic in Bangladesh to mixed forest/savanna in the rest of the region (Fig. 1  ). Water erosion from heavy rainfall and flood events are a major source of natural land and soil degradation across these regions, particularly given the monsoonal nature of the regional climate (D'odorico et al., 2013 ). There also exist several key anthropogenic drivers of land degradation, including the clearing of native forests and other vegetation for fuel, fiber, food, and increasingly infrastructure and municipal development, and the intensive management and expansion of agricultural lands and soils for crop production (Lal, 2010 ; Scholes et al., 2018 ). India's native forest cover in 2013 was ~28% of its 1930s extent, and deforestation has largely been driven by agriculture (DeFries and Pandey, 2010 ; Ravindranath et al., 2012 ). Recently, India has seen a marginal increase in forested landscapes (FSI, 2017 ), however these increases comprise mainly of cultivated and plantation trees, and not complex, multi-canopied forest ecosystems (DeFries and Pandey, 2010 ; DeFries et al., 2010 ; Ravindranath et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, habitat conversion rates inside even PAs are comparable to non-PAs with rapid development, illustrating the difficulty of enforcing conservation management (Clark et al., 2013 ). All countries except Sri Lanka are experiencing rapid urbanization (Fig. 2 a ), especially Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Pakistan where in excess of 33% of population now lives in cities (World Development Indicators, 2018 ). While Nepal is one of the least urbanized countries, with the current urbanization rate of approximately 3%, almost one-third of its population will reside in urban centers by 2045 (UNDESA, 2012 ). The proportion of forest area (SDG indicator 15.1.1) has mostly remained stable since 1990, except in Bhutan and Nepal which exhibit increasing and decreasing trends, respectively (Fig. 2 b). Bhutan also performed well for SDG indicator 15.1.2 (proportion of protected areas); however other countries showed minimal or no change (Fig. 2 c). One particularly challenging aspect of achieving SDG 15 targets is the population distribution structure in these countries (Fig. 3  ). Bangladesh, almost in entirety, hosts over 500 persons/km2 , along with the Indo-Gangetic Plain in northern India, north-eastern Pakistan, and south-western Sri Lanka. While current urbanization trends indicate continued horizontal growth of urban centers, prior studies have noted the increasing large-scale and distant impacts of urban centers on rural landscapes (Elmqvist et al., 2013 ; Grimm et al., 2008 ; Nagendra et al., 2013 ). Given that the cities contribute up to 80% of national economy in Asia (Asian Development Bank, 2011 ), it is even more important that policy-makers consider the potential impacts of population structure in and around urban centers on natural habitats, biodiversity, and ecosystem services (Nagendra et al., 2018 ). While National Planning Commissions of many south Asian countries acknowledge the importance of SDG 15, it has not been identified as a priority in the 2017 Voluntary National Reviews (VNR) of SDG implementation for Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. We further select two test cases (Fig. 4  ) – one from India and another from Sri Lanka – to evaluate satellite-derived forest degradation indicators from different spatial scales. Both test cases are national parks, thus are expected to host relatively intact forests. The Indian test case is Sanjay National Park (SNP), which is a sub-section of the larger Sanjay Dubri Tiger Reserve. The Sri Lankan test case is Ruhuna National Park (RNP). The test cases were primarily selected based on their varying ecological settings (Fig. 4 ), and opposing trends in country-level forest condition as revealed by our step-1 analysis (as described in Section 4.1 ). RNP is embedded within mostly forested landscape, and is dominated by broadleaf and savanna forest types. SNP is embedded within non-forest matrix, mostly agricultural lands, and hosts mixed/savanna forests. It is an important tiger reserve in the central Indian landscape, and plays a key role in maintaining a healthy tiger population (Dutta et al., 2016 ; Krishnamurthy et al., 2016 ; Reddy et al., 2017 ).  3 Data and methods 3.1 Coarse-scale vegetation and climate data For the coarse-scale (1-km) analysis, we utilized MODIS NDVI (MOD13A1.005) and CHIRPS Daily (version 2.0) rainfall data, both available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) center, the global MODIS NDVI data used in this study are available at the spatial resolution of 500 m for every 16 days during 2000–2017. The input data for this NDVI data set are atmospherically corrected bidirectional surface reflectance values from the red and near-infrared MODIS bands, masked for clouds, cloud shadows, water, and heavy aerosols. An updated version (v006) of the same data product is also available now on GEE for 2000–2019 (Didan, 2015 ). Provided by the University of California – Santa Barbara, CHIRPS is a land-based quasi-global (50°N-50°S) rainfall data set available for 1981-near present at a spatial resolution of 0.05° (Funk et al., 2015 ). The CHIRPS rainfall estimates are based on infrared Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) observations, calibrated with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis version 7 (TMPA 3B42 v7; Huffman et al., 2007 ). This data set combines in-situ observations and infrared satellite measurements by using a ‘smart interpolation’ approach (Willmott and Matsuura, 1995 ; Willmott and Robeson, 1995 ). NDVI, a measure of greenness, is a proxy for vegetation productivity that is largely controlled by climatic parameters, especially rainfall (Chu et al., 2007 ; Ding et al., 2007 ; Martiny et al., 2006 ; Capecchi et al., 2008 ; Hao et al., 2012 ; Liu et al., 2013 ; Bao et al., 2014 ; Hilker et al., 2014 ; Cramer and Hoffman, 2015 ; Amadi et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ). By combining two data sets – MODIS NDVI and CHIRPS rainfall – our objective is to identify regions experiencing both negative trends in productivity alongside altered rainfall, which is a key climate parameter in the seasonally water-limited region. In order to do that, we adapted the methodology developed by Bai and Dent (2009)  and Bai et al. (2012) . We first calculated the annual sum of NDVI pixel-by-pixel for each calendar year (January 1 to December 31) during 2000–2016, by aggregating the MODIS NDVI 16-day composites at a spatial scale of 1 km (a scale more suitable for regional monitoring). We further aggregated the NDVI data at the country-level, and examined the trend for each country using a 2nd-order polynomial regression model. Then we calculated the annual sum of rainfall for each year during 2000–2016 by aggregating CHIRPS daily rainfall data (spatial resolution: 0.05°), rescaled using the nearest neighbor approach to match the spatial resolution of the NDVI data. Within GEE, image assets are stored at multiple pyramid levels. When an image collection is called within a GEE code, the system selects the level of the pyramid that has a scale less than or equal to the scale specified within the code. Resampling is done as necessary using nearest neighbor technique as default. Both these data sets were accessed on the GEE platform that was used for initial processing and data download. We calculated Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE) at a pixel level, which is the ratio between annual sum of vegetation productivity and annual rainfall (i.e. NDVI per unit rainfall in this study) at an annual time step (Huxman et al., 2004 ; Wessels et al., 2007 ; Bai et al., 2008 ). Temporal trends in NDVI, rainfall and RUE were calculated for each pixel by linear regression (Fig. 5  ) using R (x64 3.4.3) software package.  3.2 Non-forest mask Since our focus is on forest ecosystems, we utilized ancillary satellite-derived data products to mask out non-forest land covers. We used the MODIS land cover type global data product (MCD12Q1.006; spatial resolution: 500 m) available on GEE annually since 2001 (Abercrombie and Friedl, 2016 ; Friedl et al., 2002 ; Friedl and Sulla-Menashe, 2019 ; McIver and Friedl, 2002 ). We extracted the band with information on 17 land cover classes according to the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) classification scheme. We then created a mask for land covers other than evergreen needleleaf/broadleaf forests (tree cover > 60%), deciduous needleleaf/broadleaf forests (tree cover > 60%), mixed forests (tree cover > 60%), savanna/woody savanna (tree cover 10–60%), and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics (small cropland interspersed with natural vegetation). A total of 16 non-forest masks were created for each year during 2001–2016 (data for 2000 was not available on GEE), for accurate quantification of vegetation changes. Hereafter, we consider only forested areas after application of the non-forest mask on NDVI, rainfall and RUE annual data sets (Fig. 5 ) for 2001–2016, excluding the year 2000 due to mask unavailability.  3.3 Finer-scale satellite data We further evaluated the potential of multiple finer-scale satellite-derived indicators for reporting forest degradation. We utilized Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager (OLI)), and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) Level-1C to identify different band combinations that might be useful in capturing the degradation signal. We utilized Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance provided by the USGS. In this data product, calibration coefficients are extracted from image metadata following the method described in Chander et al. (2009) . The Sentinel-2 data are provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), and includes radiometric and geometric corrections following the methods described in the Sentinel-2 User Handbook (SUHET, 2015 ). We selected these data sources as they are freely available on GEE, have footprints and temporal range suitable for SDG reporting, and provide access to satellite data at various scales, ranging from 10 m to 30 m. The TOA reflectance data products have minimal spectral differences across images acquired on different dates, as those are corrected for sun elevation, sun-earth distance, and acquisition time (Chander et al., 2009 ). As such, these data products have been extensively used in land use and land cover change studies for generating thematic land cover classes (Hansen et al., 2011 ; Liu et al., 2014 ). While surface reflectance products, i.e. TOA reflectance corrected for atmospheric effects including the impacts of atmospheric aerosols, gases and water vapor, are better suited for deriving biophysical products (Kaufman, 1985 ; Richter, 1996 ), those are not always feasible to derive due to the lack of atmospheric information required for such correction. Besides, surface reflectance products were not readily available on GEE at the time of this analysis. We used TOA data products for both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 to maintain some degrees of comparability; however, adding an extra step in the framework to calculate surface reflectance data product would result in more accurate estimates of biophysical characteristics of land covers. Previous studies have shown the potential of combining the visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands from the Landsat suite for identifying forest degradation and forest cover change across a range of ecosystem (Broich et al., 2011 ; Hansen et al., 2008 ; Potapov et al., 2009, 2014, 2015 ). Varying the native spatial resolution by the method of pan-sharpening is also known to provide better accuracy in such studies (Meroni et al., 2017 ). More recently, Sentinel data are being used for forest cover studies due to their similar spectral properties as Landsat 8 and higher spatial resolution (Korhonen et al., 2017 ; Puletti et al., 2018 ; Sothe et al., 2017 ). Based on these prior studies, we evaluated the following band combinations:(i) Landsat 8 Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance bands 2–7; spatial resolution 30 m for all bands.  (ii) Landsat 8 bands 5, 6, 10, sharpened by panchromatic band 8; spatial resolution 30 m for these three bands resampled to 15 m after pan-sharpening.  (iii) Sentinel 2 TOA reflectance bands 2–4, 8, 8A, 11, 12; spatial resolution 10 m for all bands except bands 8a, 11, 12 (20 m) – resampled to 10 m.    Image composites with <10% cloud cover were selected during October–December 2016 for both Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 to utilize the maximum spectral separability between different classes based on phenological differences. We used a short time-span of 3 months for this step to minimize the potential errors that could be introduced by compositing images from multiple dates. Median values for each band were used in analysis to avoid noise in spectral signal. For pan-sharpening Landsat data, we used the HSV-sharpening method, also known as the IHS (intensity-hue-saturation) fusion method (Carper et al., 1990 ; Ŝvab and Oŝtir, 2006 ). In this method, the input image is first converted from an RGB (red-green-blue) color space to HSV (hue-saturation-value) color space, followed by the swapping of the panchromatic band for the ‘V’ in HSV, and converting the image back to the RGB space. We used the GEE platform for access, analysis, classification, and initial validation of these satellite-derived indicators. In order to adequately capture the forest degradation signal, we focused on three classes: intact forest, non-intact forest (showing signs of degradation such as thinned canopy), and non-forest. We considered pixels with visibly thinned canopy (<50% of pixel area) as non-intact forest (Fig. 6  ).  3.4 Random forest classifier For each of the three sensor/band combinations, we ran a random forest (RF) classifier on GEE for each park, resulting in a total of 6 classifications (Fig. 7  ). The RF classifier was selected as it is widely used in forest cover change studies, easy to implement with an in-built classifier on GEE platform, and is known to improve the accuracy of the classified maps through the combination of random subsets of trees (Breiman, 2001 ; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012 ; Sothe et al., 2017 ). Within RF, each classifier uses a random vector that is sampled independently from the original training set (Breiman, 1996 ). Bootstrap aggregating or bagging, a method to generate random vectors, is used to select training data for each class. Each pixel is then assigned to a class based on the majority vote from all tree predictors. The number of trees within a RF, along with the number of variables at each split, is a user-defined parameter. However, RF performance is not sensitive to the number of variables at each split. Hence many platforms, including GEE and R statistical software package, set a default value at the square root of the input variables. Limiting this value in such a way not only reduces the computational complexity, but also decreases correlation among the trees (Gislason et al., 2006 ). We set the number of trees at 10 for the RF classifier in this study, and used the default for the variables per split. Unlike decision tree classifiers, RF does not require tree pruning, a machine-learning method to ‘prune’ the tree sections that do not contribute to overall performance, thus further improving computational performance. Park boundaries were obtained from the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). For each park, we further identify the “Places of Agreement” (PoA), where pixels were identified as non-intact forest or non-forest in all 3 classifications.  3.5 Calibration and validation We used high-resolution images available on GEE for collecting calibration and validation data required for classifying finer-scale satellite data as described above. For SNP, we collected a total of 650 points (intact forest: 200, non-intact forest: 250, non-forest: 200). For RNP, a total of 400 points were collected (intact forest: 200, non-intact forest: 50, non-forest: 150). The number of points for each class approximately mimics the proportion of each class based on visual inspection. While 60% of these points were used as training for the RF classification, 40% were used for validation purposes. After downloading the classified images from GEE platform, we performed validation using the exact same set of validation points (different from the calibration/training points) for all band combinations to exclude any difference in accuracies that might arise from using different set of validation points. We report producer's/user's accuracy as well as kappa index as a measure of the classification accuracy.   4 Results 4.1 Current trends in country-level forest condition Aggregated at the country-level, the vegetation trend since 2001 ranged from greening (Pakistan, India, Nepal) to browning (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka), while Bhutan showed almost no trend (Fig. 8  ). It should be noted, however, that most of these trends exhibit a rather low significance, as represented by low adjusted R2  values. This may be partly due to substantial time-variations exhibited for most countries. While a positive trend in forest NDVI (adjusted R2  = 0.89) is exhibited in Pakistan, greening in India (adjusted R2  = 0.31) and Nepal (adjusted R2  = 0.21) is more localized. Forests show localized browning in the north-eastern states of India, and parts of Nepal and Sri Lanka (Fig. 5 a).  4.2 Spatial variations in vegetation trends in response to rainfall Fig. 5  also displays spatial variations in rainfall and RUE trends across the countries. RUE trends are mostly positive (Fig. 5 c), spanning over regions where either both NDVI and rainfall are increasing (e.g. south-eastern Nepal), or where both are declining (e.g. north-eastern India). In these regions, changes in NDVI occur alongside similar changes in rainfall. The regions where RUE shows a declining trend, however, requires special attention from land managers and/or policy-makers. Specifically, regions where NDVI has a faster declining trend compared to rainfall are likely to be undergoing degradation due to additional drivers beyond rainfall and climate changes. Regions with opposing RUE trends, might be suffering from finer-scale degradation processes. A broad-brush approach such as the one described above would fail to capture those changes. As shown in Fig. 9  , SNP witnessed greening in response to increasing rainfall, yet shows a declining RUE trend. On the other hand, RNP has seen a decline in rainfall, yet experienced localized greening, resulting in an increase in RUE over the years. Further examinations of these test cases reveal that degradation signals might not be always captured using a broad-brush approach, and thus further work is required to adequately disentangle the driving degradation forces.  4.3 The current state of forests for test cases Finer-scale analyses reveal that SNP only has a little over one-third of its area as intact forest, while another one-third was identified as non-intact forest (Fig. 10  ). While the accuracy of each of the three classifications for SNP differ (Table 1  ), the overall proportion of the three land covers as identified by the three classified maps are somewhat similar. Intact forest area ranged between 38.6% and 41.2% of the total park area, closely followed by non-intact forest ranging between 36.8% and 40.3%, depending on data combinations. Non-forest, i.e. completely cleared area, ranged between 21% and 23.1%. The classified map derived from Sentinel-2 data had the highest overall accuracy of 87%, with kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960 ) of 0.80 (Table 1 ). We also ran the classifier for Sentinel-2 data rescaled at 20 m. However, the classified maps for both PAs are similar to the maps generated by the Sentinel 2 data at 10 m, both in terms of spatial distribution and areas under different land covers. The PoA approach reveals that all three classifications identified approximately 36% of area in SNP as either non-intact forest or non-forest (Fig. 10 ). For RNP, Landsat-derived estimates for intact forest are lower than the estimates based on Sentinel-2 data, ranging between 74.6% and 87.2%. Compared to SNP, the proportion of degraded forest in RNP is much smaller, ranging between 5.5% and 10.7%. However, estimates for non-forest area are 7.1%–19.6% depending on the source data. Yet again, Sentinel-2 data provide the highest overall accuracy of 91% with kappa index of 0.85 (Table 1 ). Accuracies are particularly low for non-intact forest for all three sensor configurations, likely because of fewer training points available for non-intact forest cover to train the random forest classifier. Due to these variations among the three classified maps, the PoA is only 3.4% for non-intact forest or non-forest area in RNP (Fig. 10 ).   5 Discussion The present study focuses on quantifying recent trends in forest covers, which may be more water and nutrient limited than managed landscapes. Donohue et al. (2013)  show that warm, arid environments, inclusive of some South Asian natural landscapes, have undergone a greening. However, Sarmah et al. (2018)  found that, despite overall greening trends in South Asia, natural vegetation land covers exhibited more browning, particularly during the winter and Northeast Monsoon (NEM), although the different types of natural vegetation present were not distinguished between these studies. Jeyaseelan et al. (2007)  suggest that more temperate and moist deciduous forests along the sub-continent have grown more slowly compared to managed land types over the latter 20th century. Additionally, it has also been found that recent greening trends in South Asia/India are not monotonic, but have undergone recent variation and “setbacks” (temporary pauses) (de Jong et al., 2013a, 2013b ; Liu et al., 2015 ), though the precise reason for this is not yet firmly established. In some PAs, such as those that overlap with important wildlife corridors, browning trends have been found due to the encroachment of human development, while greening trends can be partially attributed to the spread of invasive species, which are able to capitalize on improved environmental conditions (e.g. CO2  fertilization effects), and thrive despite other limitations (Mallegowda et al., 2015 ). Our findings corroborate the ‘localized greening’ theory (Fig. 5 ), and present evidence that policy-makers need to see beyond the aggregated greening trend while reporting progress in achieving SDG targets. Our test cases specifically highlight the need for a more nuanced approach for capturing subtle changes within forest covers (Fig. 10 ). Since forest degradation can manifest in disparate ways regionally and in different biomes, ascertaining a singular method remains challenging (Mitchell et al., 2017 ). General approaches to assess degradation include estimates of canopy cover (to assess changes in forest area) and biomass (as a metric of process-level change) (Mitchell et al., 2017 ). Gross forest area change and reductions in biomass (Scholes et al., 2018 ) must also be supplemented with measurements of forest interior area to assess fragmentation, which can often lead to degradation (Riitters et al., 2016 ). Using satellite-derived estimates (e.g. NDVI) to evaluate changes in productivity efficiency (Bai et al., 2008 ), with respect to limiting environmental factors, can serve as another method of assessing forest degradation (Scholes et al., 2018 ; Sloan and Sayer, 2015 ). Recent studies have leveraged Landsat data to produce global maps of tree cover percentage (Hansen et al., 2013 ), employed structural change monitoring methods using the Landsat suite to evaluate forest disturbance dynamics over specific regions (DeVries et al., 2015 ), deployed LiDAR monitoring of canopy/forest height and structure (Mitchell et al., 2017 ), and combined mixed data products that, for example, combined Landsat images with MODIS measures of NDVI and rainfall to assess regional forest losses (Dutrieux et al., 2015 ). While these methods provided a moderate- to high-resolution record for regional land and forest degradation assessments, the high technical proficiency demand and computational expenses often limit their utility to decision-makers and stakeholders, particularly for SDG reporting purposes. Additionally, if NDVI or measures of net primary productivity are applied without the underlying land-use context, they may be less indicative of degradation (Gibbs and Salmon, 2015 ). In an attempt to address the issues mentioned above, we provide a reporting framework below for SDG targets based on multi-scale analysis of forest degradation.Step-1 : Identify climate-adjusted vegetation trends across the country. As shown in this study, this analysis can utilize comparatively coarser-scale satellite data. Energy-use efficiency (EUE) that calculates the ratio of annual sum of NDVI and annual sum of temperature (Bai and Dent, 2008) can be used as an additional measure other than RUE. As a sub-step, these findings must be considered in the context of land uses, and forest areas should be extracted from the national-level maps for further examinations (e.g. Fig. 5 ). This step will identify priority areas where vegetation has a faster declining trend compared to what can be expected from solely climatic effect, hence likely to be exhibiting consequences of unsustainable anthropogenic activities. Policy-makers then can focus on those priority areas for making progress in terms of SDG indicator 15.2.1.  Step-2 : Irrespective of the priority status as per step-1, policy-makers focus on the PAs in this step. In order to achieve SDG target 15, maintaining healthy vegetation within the PAs and the forest corridors connecting them is crucial. As shown by our analyses, this step would require a more detailed look into forest condition. Our findings indicate that the higher the spatial resolution of the input satellite data (such as 10 m for Sentinel-2), the higher the accuracy. Hence, it is possible that using very high-resolution data (e.g. <5 m) for such analyses will generate more accurate maps. However, most of these very high-resolution satellite data are expensive and have very small footprints, thus they might not be the best option for SDG reporting. Based on our findings, we recommend creating independent forest cover/condition maps utilizing several sets of satellite data to ultimately identify PoA (e.g. Fig. 10 ). The PoAs for non-intact forest or non-forest are the high-priority areas, especially within the PAs. Land managers can then focus on these priority areas for reviving forest health when permitted by the management strategies. It is possible that some places would be permanently non-forest or non-intact forest within PAs, e.g. access roads or tourist accommodations. The land managers then need to ensure that these land use effects do not spill over on the intact forest.  Step-3 : Create an annual reporting plan that will follow steps 1 and 2 and will generate geospatial data that can contribute to the long-term monitoring scheme. In addition to tabular formats generally used for government reporting, this step should include spatial maps, such as Figs. 5 and 9 . This is to ensure that any ‘cleared’ patches within the forests are easily recognizable, and any inter-annual changes in those patches, such as expansion or contraction, are detected early in the process and conveyed to the policy-makers. These maps can be a good tool in recognizing spatial patterns in forest degradation, if any, and in turn underlying processes, thus facilitating sustainable forest management strategies. Our multi-scale data product report changes in forest cover/condition (1 km and 10 m) for a more recent time frame (2001–2016), so that the 2016 map can be used as a baseline for SDG monitoring at a national level.    It should be noted that our objective in this work is to provide a simple but functional work plan that can be easily implemented by policy-makers across the globe, but especially in developing countries where computing resources or required skill-sets for geospatial analyses might be limiting effective and timely SDG reporting. Our proposed framework is solely based on freely available data, widely used methods, and cloud computing platform that make our framework easily implementable in most countries. For both Landsat and Sentinel, we used TOA data that retain considerable atmospheric signals. In order to represent biophysical properties of vegetation, TOA data should be corrected for atmospheric signals and the resulting surface reflectance data should be used. However, we converted TOA data into thematic information (land cover map) in our proposed framework, hence our findings should not be influenced by our data choice. This is not an exhaustive plan; rather we view it as a much-needed starting point that will initiate a dialogue among state-level policy-makers and land managers. There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach for forest degradation monitoring, especially for countries that host a variety of ecosystems (Scholes et al., 2018 ). Hence, we recommend utilizing a set of different satellite data along with the PoA approach to optimize the cost of land management. However, land managers need to closely monitor potential degraded patches, especially if identified as such in the most accurate spatial map, even if it was not captured by all high-resolution maps. The approach that must be taken should be determined by the baseline status of the forest. For example, the SNP test case has a very high proportion of non-intact forest and non-forest within the PA. Test cases such as SNP would require a much stringent monitoring and forest reviving plan than that required by cases more alike RNP. It is particularly important for the countries to establish/facilitate ‘geospatial nodes’ with skillsets required for such monitoring for each sub-national administrative units. These nodes should work in parallel to ensure that a timely monitoring is in place, should report back to the higher administrative level at an annual meeting, and share success/failure stories and lessons learned. The compiled report along with spatial maps from each state can then be used for national level reporting purposes, rather than an aggregated report for the entire country. It is also important that these derived geospatial data sets are freely available on an open platform, possibly via a ‘data dashboard’, to maintain integrity and accountability.
