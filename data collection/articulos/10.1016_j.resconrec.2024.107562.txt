                  In the past decades, municipal solid waste (MSW) has generally been recognized as a substance that poses risks to human health and the ecosystem. With the emergence of the sustainable idea, MSW began to be recognized as a renewable resource and technological methods were used to make MSW as a resource utilization potential (RUP) source. SDGs realization relies on MSW's sustainable management. However, how the MSW's RUP affects to SDGs and how the two are coupled still needs to be explored. In this study, we took China, the largest MSW producer in developing countries, as an example. First, we selected 17 SDG indicators (including 83 nested indicators) and assessed China's SDG progress from 2005 to 2021 based on the SDG weighting calculation method. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were then used to explore the direct and indirect impacts of MSW's RUP on the SDGs. Finally, a counterfactual analysis was used to determine the regional heterogeneity of the impact of MSW's RUP on SDGs. The results show that China made greater progress in its SDG scores overall between 2005 and 2021, with particularly strong progress in SDG1 (poverty eradication) and SDG3 (healthy living). The MSW's RUP contributes positively to SDGs 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 17 (economy, health, water, industry, community, and global partnerships). The response of SDGs 2, 7, and 16 (zero hunger, energy, and justice) to MSW's RUP showed a threshold when the MSW's RUP value was 0.3 GJ. The MSW's RUP has a negative impact on SDG13 and SDG15 (climate change and ecosystems). Regional heterogeneity exists in the relationship between MSW's RUPs and the SDGs, therefore the promotion of MSW's RUPs is targeted to different provinces. The MSW's RUP provides significant potential for improvement in energy production and material production, and adherence to managing MSW using a sustainable mindset will contribute to the goal of carbon neutrality by 2060.

In the past decades, municipal solid waste (MSW) has generally been recognized as a substance that poses risks to human health and the ecosystem. With the emergence of the sustainable idea, MSW began to be recognized as a renewable resource and technological methods were used to make MSW as a resource utilization potential (RUP) source. SDGs realization relies on MSW's sustainable management. However, how the MSW's RUP affects to SDGs and how the two are coupled still needs to be explored. In this study, we took China, the largest MSW producer in developing countries, as an example. First, we selected 17 SDG indicators (including 83 nested indicators) and assessed China's SDG progress from 2005 to 2021 based on the SDG weighting calculation method. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were then used to explore the direct and indirect impacts of MSW's RUP on the SDGs. Finally, a counterfactual analysis was used to determine the regional heterogeneity of the impact of MSW's RUP on SDGs. The results show that China made greater progress in its SDG scores overall between 2005 and 2021, with particularly strong progress in SDG1 (poverty eradication) and SDG3 (healthy living). The MSW's RUP contributes positively to SDGs 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 17 (economy, health, water, industry, community, and global partnerships). The response of SDGs 2, 7, and 16 (zero hunger, energy, and justice) to MSW's RUP showed a threshold when the MSW's RUP value was 0.3 GJ. The MSW's RUP has a negative impact on SDG13 and SDG15 (climate change and ecosystems). Regional heterogeneity exists in the relationship between MSW's RUPs and the SDGs, therefore the promotion of MSW's RUPs is targeted to different provinces. The MSW's RUP provides significant potential for improvement in energy production and material production, and adherence to managing MSW using a sustainable mindset will contribute to the goal of carbon neutrality by 2060.

The sustainable development goals (SDG) aim to pursue a balance between the economy, society, and the environment, tackling major challenges such as poverty, inequality, climate change, and environmental damage (Halkos and Gkampoura, 2021 ). The SDGs consist of 17 goals and 169 embedded indicators, providing research direction for scholars and policymakers around the globe (UN, 2015 ). Cities are the basic units for the implementation of the SDGs, and the effective management of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a key component of the implementation of the SDGs at the city level. The rapid development of urbanization and the improvement of people's living standards have resulted in the unlimited generation of MSW (Chau et al., 2020 ). Currently, most countries and cities are still dealing with MSW by traditional means such as landfill and incineration, which cause environmental pollution and large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and have negative impacts on human health and climate change (Nanda and Berruti, 2021 ). For the management of MSW, the government has shifted to the idea of sustainable management. Although MSW is a waste substance, it is classified as one of the biomass energy categories because it contains recyclable materials and reusable organic materials (Kothari et al., 2010 ). These materials can be processed through composting or anaerobic digestion to produce organic fertilizers to improve the soil (Shiralipour et al., 1992 ); or to produce biogas to generate heat for power generation, replacing fuels (Dinesh et al., 2018 ; Khoshnevisan et al., 2020 ; Tyagi et al., 2018 ); or to be converted into bio-materials such as fibers and buildings with lower carbon emissions (Kaur et al., 2021 ; Soni et al., 2022 ). It is urgent to maximize the resource utilization potential (RUP) of MSW, reduce human demand for natural and non-renewable resources, reduce the amount of waste, and achieve resource recycling. Converting waste into utilizable resources is one of the most attractive options for sustainable urban development in the future. In 2016 about 2 billion tons MSW were generated globally. MSW was predicted to grow by 70 % to 3.4 billion tons by 2050 (Kaza et al., 2018 ). China generated 203 million tons of MSW in 2018 (NBS, 2016 ), accounting for 10.1 % of the world (Kaza et al., 2018 ). China, the developing country with the largest MSW generation and the highest potential for waste-to-resource conversion, is striving to achieve SDG in the face of complex environmental and socio-economic challenges policies (Mian et al., 2017 ). To promote sustainable development, China has implemented various measures such as the Western Development Strategy. Policies such as the âComprehensive Resource Utilization Industry Development Planâ and the â13th Five-Year Plan for the Construction of National Domestic Waste Management Facilitiesâ have been put forward, especially for MSW. To achieve China's ambitious SDGs, it is urgent to assess the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of China's RUP of MSW and SDG, to explore the coupling relationship between MSW's RUP and SDG. Previous studies have focused on SDGs which are directly affected by RUP, and preliminary studies have explored the contribution of RUP to part of the SDGs, such as mitigating climate change (SDG13) (Alam et al., 2022 ), ensuring human health (SDG3) (Alam et al., 2022 ), living in livable urban environments (SDG11) (AlQattan et al., 2018 ), and providing cleaner energy for humans (SDG7) (AlQattan et al., 2018 ; Dada and Mbohwa, 2017 ). Such studies linked RUP to climate and environment, emphasizing the importance of MSW's RUP in combating global warming and achieving carbon neutrality. However, existing studies have only focused on the direct impact of RUP on individual SDGs or the whole SDGs, and have not yet explored the direct and indirect impacts of RUP on each 17 SDG indicators (including many nested indicators). The relationship between MSW's RUP and the 17 SDGs is multidimensional and intertwined. It is difficult to characterize the dependent variable with simple correlation analyses when it is limited by some indirect effects (Kim and Neff, 2010 ; Van Acker et al., 2007 ). However, the structural equation model (SEM) can fill these gaps. SEM includes path analysis, multiple regression analysis, and factor analysis, which can analyze multiple causal relationships simultaneously (MartÃ­nez-FalcÃ³ et al., 2023 ; Prokofieva et al., 2023 ). SEM sorts out the role of multiple dependent variables on the independent variable and selects the dominant factor, which makes it possible to explore the implicit relationships behind complex factors. Current studies are using SEM to explore the relationship between the SDGs and high-quality urban development (Yamasaki and Yamada, 2022 ), green technology, and green culture (Wang et al., 2022 ). Therefore, using SEM to explore the contribution of MSW's RUP to multiple SDGs and the causal relationship between them is key to the development of a sustainable MSW management policy. In this work, the contribution of RUP to the progress of all SDGs is systematically investigated. Firstly, we assessed the changes in the process and spatial distribution of SDG scores in China from 2005 to 2021 by constructing a system of indicators for evaluating the provincial scale of China's SDGs. Then we analyzed the impact of MSW's RUP on SDG progression by regression analysis and SEM, and the direction and threshold of MSW's RUP for SDG progression were discussed. Finally, the regional heterogeneity of the effect of RUP on SDG is explored by counterfactual analysis. Our study found that MSW's RUP has a contributive effect on most of the SDG developments, but found that MSW's RUP is not a positive contribution to sustainable development for mitigating climate change, and a focus needs to be placed on other initiatives to improve the climate. Our work focuses on emphasizing the contribution that MSW's RUP is required for the achievement of the SDGs.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Indicators selection We selected indicators from a combination of the United Nationsâ official list of global Sustainable Development Goal indicators (Division., 2017 ), the 2018 SDG Index and Dashboards Report (Sachs et al., 2018 ), and previous studies (Xu et al., 2020 ; Yin et al., 2023 ). The 2018 SDG Index and Dashboards provided a robust and quantitative method of measuring SDG baselines at the country level that has been applied to subsequent scientific research. For each SDG, we chose as many SDG indicators as was feasible from the list of recommended indicators, based on data availability both at the provincial and national levels in China.  2.2 Data collection We collected SDG data of 31 provinces from 2005 to 2021, including 17 goals and 83 nested indicators. Data for the selected indicators in this study were obtained from the following sources: China Statistical Yearbook (China, 2005â2021a ), China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook (China, 2005â2021b ), and Statistical Bulletin of National Economics. Supplementary information Table S1 for a list of SDGs and their corresponding indicators and the data sources used in this paper.  2.3 Index calculation methods 2.3.1 Calculation of RUP MSW is a biomass resource, and its RUP is usually evaluated based on yearbook statistics or remote sensing data; however, due to the current lack of remote sensing data on MSW in China, this study adopted calculations based on yearbook and literature statistics (Kang et al., 2020 ). Our study assessed the potential of M S W R U P      at the provincial scale from 2005 to 2021 based on statistical data on disposed quantity of MSW. Equations of the R U P i t     is as follows (Cheng and Hu, 2010 ; Kang et al., 2020 ):(1) R U P i t  = M S W i t  Ã L H V i       Where M S W i t     is the disposed quantity of M S W    in i   province in year t  , kg; L H V i     is the average lower heating value of MSW in i   province, kJ/kg. As far as possible, L H V    for each province were collected from previous literature (Table S2), and L H V    for provinces that were not collected were replaced with an average of 5344 kJ/kg.  2.3.2 Calculation of SDG index (1) Construct the SDG index framework       We construct an index system based on the SDGs to assess Chinese SDG progress. (1) SDG1 includes 5 indicators related end poverty such as unemployment insurance, medical insurance, etc. (2) SDG2 includes 7 indicators related to food agriculture such as grain production, cereal production, etc. (3) SDG3 includes 6 indicators related to healthy lives such as the numbers of hospitals, the number of doctors, etc. (4) SDG4 includes 5 indicators about education such as the number of students, the number of higher education institutions, etc. (5) SDG5 includes 3 indicators related to gender equality such as the number of Maternal and Child Health Centre, etc. (6) SDG6 includes 4 indicators related to water sustainable availability such as water resources per capita, municipal wastewater treatment capacity, etc. (7) SDG7 includes 3 indicators related sustainable energy such as urban-gas using population, etc. (8) SDG8 includes 5 indicators related economy such as workersâ wages, urban unemployment rate, etc. (9) SDG9 includes 9 indicators related infrastructure and innovation such as the number of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, internet penetration, etc. (10) SDG10 includes 6 indicators related urban-rural equality. (11) SDG11 includes 6 indicators related to population density, road length, etc. (12) SDG12 includes 5 indicators related to sustainable consumption such as MSW non-hazardous disposal rate, etc. (13) SDG13 includes 5 indicators related to climate change such as CO2  emissions, natural disaster-affected population, etc. (14) SDG14 includes 2 indicators related to marine resources such as the number of marine meteorological stations, etc. (15) SDG15 includes 7 indicators related to ecosystems such as forest cover, urban green space, etc. (16) SDG16 includes 3 indicators related to accountable institutions such as primary health care institutions, (17) SDG17 includes 2 indicators related to global partnership. Specific content and data sources of indicators are provided in the supplementary material (Table S1). After selecting these indicators, we preprocessed the data and distinguished the contribution direction of each indicator to sustainable development according to a previous study (Xu et al., 2020 ). Positive indicators mean that the larger the indicator data, the more sustainable development is for the region; negative indicators, on the other hand, mean that the lower the indicator data, the more sustainable development is for the region.(2) Normalization of the indicator's value       After constructing the SDG indicator framework, we used the following equation to standardize the indicators and then presented them as a 0â100 percentage scale. Positive indicators and negative indicators use different standardized formulas (Gennari and D'Orazio, 2020 ). Positive indicators:(2) x p  = x â min ( x )   max ( x )  â min ( x )    Ã 100      Negative indicators:(3) x n  = max ( x )  â x  max ( x )  â min ( x )    Ã 100      Where x p    is the normalized individual score for a positive indicator, x n    is the normalized individual score for a negative indicator, x   is the original data value of each SDG indicator, min ( x )   , max ( x )    represent the maximum/minimum value of the SDG indicator.(3) Calculation of SDG index scores       Under the SDG principles identified in the 2030 Agenda, social, economic, and ecological development are inseparable and play an equal role in the sustainable development agenda (UN, 2015 , 2021 ). Therefore, we calculated SDG index scores at the national and provincial levels using arithmetic means, following the approach used in the 2018 SDG Index and Dashboards Report (Sachs et al., 2018 ). The score of each SDG index is weighted equally by the indicator to which it belongs, conveying the importance of integrated solutions that equally address all indicators (Sachs et al., 2018 ). Consistent with previous research, there is no a priori reason to give one indicator greater weight than another (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ).   2.4 Statistical analysis 2.4.1 Regression analysis We used linear regression analysis on the relationship between the MSW's RUP and SDGs, and selected statistically significant fitting results (p  < 0.05). Segmented fits were performed for the indicators that failed the significance test to determine the thresholds affecting the relationship between the RUP of MSW and SDGs, and then we fit a linear fit to the region surrounding the thresholds separately. The relationship between MSW's RUP and SDG was also determined by the trend of the polynomial regression. The linear regression analysis expression is shown in Eq. (4) :(4) S D G i , j    â¾  = Î± j  + Î² j  Ã R U P i   â¾       Where S D G i , j    â¾    refers to the average score of SDG indicator category j   in province i   from 2005 to 2021, R U P i   â¾    refers to the average R U P    for province i   from 2005 to 2021.  2.4.2 Patrial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical approach that permits the specification of interconnected response and predictor variables in the testing of multivariate hypotheses. SEM is similar to, but more powerful than regression analyses, with the ability to examine statistical and causal relationships between variables (including multiple conceptual measures) while accounting for measurement error. Therefore, in our study, after regression analysis, we selected SDGs that have a linear correlation with MSW's RUP to construct PLS-SEM. PLS-SEM was performed because the manifest variables were non-normally distributed and the volume of data is relatively small. It should be noted that in the PLS-SEM, latent variables are not specified; rather, standardized path coefficients are obtained based on the path analysis. We excluded SDGs with nonlinear relationships with MSW's RUP to deduce comparable standardized path coefficients. Finally, the direct and indirect relationships between MSW's RUP and each SDGs were determined. The algorithm of PLS-SEM is as follows (Spirou et al., 2021 ):(5) S D G j i   â¾  = Î± j  + Î² j  Ã R U P i   â¾  + â k â  j   Î³ k  Ã S D G k i   â¾       Where S D G j i   â¾    and S D G k i   â¾    refers to the average score of SDG indicator category j   and k   in province i   from 2005 to 2021, R U P i   â¾    refers to the average R U P    for province i   from 2005 to 2021, Î² j    was the regression coefficient, Î³ k    was the component matrix, Î± j    was the constant term. To determine the âBESTâ model with the highest predictive performance, the following criteria were given: the degrees of freedom (1 < DF < 3), the probability level (P -value > 0.05), the root mean square error of approximation (0 < RMSEA < 0.08), the comparative fit index (0.97 < CFI < 1), the normed fit index (NFI > 0.9), and the incremental fit index (IFI > 0.9) (Henseler et al., 2015 ; Scheffer and Carpenter, 2003 ). PLS-SEM analysis was performed based on the âlavaanâ package in R, the main code is provided in the Supporting Information.  2.4.3 Counterfactual analysis To reflect the provincial differences in the degree of impact of MSW's RUP on SDGs in China, we analyze it by constructing a counterfactual model. Regression analysis of the relationship between MSW's RUP and SDGs was used as a basis. The emergence of bio-composting as a treatment method in China and the rise of waste-to-energy technology in China began in 2005, which was the starting point for the accelerated emergence of MSW's RUP (Cheng et al., 2007 ). Eq. (6)  was constructed to calculate the counterfactual MSW's RUP, reflecting the situation when MSW's RUP does not promote the development of SDGs. Subscript i   and j   denote province and SDG category, respectively.(6) S D G i , j  R U P  i n   2005   = a j + Î² j  Ã R U P i 2005       Where S D G i , j  R U P  i n  2005      is the deduced counterfactual value with RUP to 2005, denotes the SDG score when the 2005 RUP level is maintained, Î± j    is a regression constant, Î² j    is regression coefficient, R U P i 2005     is MSW's RUP for province i   in 2005. Finally, the impact of MSW's RUP is the difference between the actual observed value and the counterfactual values:(7) I m p a c t i , j   = S D G i , j  O b s e r v e d   â S D G i , j  R U P  i n  2005    S D G i , j  o b s e r v e d         (8) S D G i , j  O b s e r v e d   = S D G i 2005 â 2021    â¾       In this form, S D G i , j  O b s e r v e d      refers to the actual average value of SDG indicators in 2021, I m p a c t i , j      quantifies the extent to which actual j   category SDG scores in i   province is better or worse than the counterfactual SDG scores, thereby reflecting the degree of improvement or deterioration in SDG scores due to MSW's RUP during 2005â2021. When I m p a c t i , j      is greater (less) than 0, it means that the actual SDG score is more (less) than the counterfactual SDG score, suggesting that MSW's RUP promotes (inhibits) SDG score increases.    3 Results 3.1 SDG index scores and MSW's RUP distribution in China The average index scores of 17 SDGs in China during 2005â2021 were uneven (Fig.1a  ). SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG12 (environment-friendly consumption) are among those that have made significant progress. SDG11 and SDG12 are concerned with sustainable consumption, production patterns, and urbanization processes, respectively. Followed by SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (healthy lives), SDG5 (gender equality), and SDG6 (clean water), which has also made excellent progress, with the SDG index scores exceeding 37.0. However, SDG14 (marine resource), SDG16 (peace and justice society), and SDG17 (global partnership) made very little progress, with all of their SDG index scores below 20.0. Fig.1b  shows the spatial distribution of SDG index scores in China during 2005â2021. SDG progress from 2005 to 2021 is unevenly distributed across China's provincial-level regions, and coastal regions (Liaoning, Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong) have higher SDG index scores relative to inland regions, with average scores above 48.0. Northwestern and southwestern regions (Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Guizhou, Yunnan) have relatively weak SDG progress, with average scores below 45.0. SDG index score in Xinjiang which in inland regions is an exception, with an average score of 48.2 over the last 15 years. Provinces located in central China, such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi, have a moderate level of SDG progress, with SDG scores ranging from 45.0 to 48.0. Overall, except for Xinjiang, the SDG development of coastal provinces is more prominent, the level of SDG development in the central region is moderate, and the development of SDG in the western region is relatively weak. Fig.2   shows the spatial distribution of RUP during 2005â2021, which was also uneven at China's provincial level. Its distribution was similar to the spatial distribution of SDG index scores. Coastal regions such as Liaoning, Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Guangdong have higher RUP, above 4.0 GJ. Central regions of China such as Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Chongqing, and Guangxi have medium levels of RUP. Northwestern and Southwestern regions of China such as Tibet, Qinghai, Guizhou, and Ningxia have lower RUP, below 1.0 GJ. These island provinces have a low population, thus generating lesser MSW quantity, and RUP levels are relatively weak (Wang et al., 2020 ).  3.2 Changes in SDG index scores between 2005 and 2021 (at the national level or province level) Fig.3   shows changes in 17 SDG index scores between 2005 and 2021. From the national perspective (Fig.3a ), 15 SDG indexes of 17 showed an increase in scores, and SDG13 (climate change) scores have trended downward over the years, down by 8 points. However, the change of SDG14 (marine resource) was 0. The top 3 SDGs for improvement (in descending order of difference score) are SDG3 (healthy lives), SDG1 (end poverty), and SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), differences are all over 70 points. Fig.3b  shows the changes of 17 SDG index scores from a provincial-level perspective. The color scale shows the change in the 17 SDG index scores, green represents a positive change, while red represents a negative change between 2005 and 2021. It is clear from Fig.3b  that most provinces show a significant trend of progress in SDG1 (end poverty), SDG3 (healthy lives), and SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) indexes. In 21 provinces, SDG13 (climate change) shows a declining trend, an average decrease of 15 points. And in Tianjin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Tibet, and Shanghai, SDG5 (gender equality) scores drop between 2005 and 2021. All in all, 17 SDG index scores are largely consistent on a national level and provincial level.  3.3 Regression analysis of MSW's RUP and SDG progress Fig.4   shows that the regression analysis result of the average RUP and the average scores of the 17 SDG indicators for the 31 provinces in China from 2005 to 2021, among which 10 SDG indicators show a statistically significant linear relationship with RUP (Fig.4 ). Among them, SDG1 (end poverty), SDG3 (healthy lives), SDG6 (clean water), SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), SDG10 (reduce inequality), SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG17 (global partnership) showed a positive correlation with MSW's RUP. SDG13 (climate change), and SDG15 (ecosystem) showed a negative correlation with MSW's RUP. SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG7 (clean energy), and SDG16 (peace and justice society) are changing in the relationship with RUP at certain thresholds. When RUP is less than 0.3 GJ, the relationship between SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG7 (clean energy), SDG16 (peace and justice), and RUP are positively correlated; when RUP is greater than 0.3 GJ, the relationship between SDG7 (clean energy), SDG16 (peace and justice society) and RUP is negatively correlated. Therefore, using RUP = 0.3 GJ as a boundary, we explored areas where the average RUP was above and below 0.3 GJ in 31 provinces during 2005â2021 (Fig.5  ). The results showed that the regions with RUP higher than 0.3 GJ are located in the economically developing urban agglomerations such as Harbin-Jilin-Liaoning (Heilongjiang, Liaoning), Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Beijing, Hebei), Yangtze River Delta (Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang), Pearl River Delta (Guangdong), in addition to the central China regions such as Sichuan, Henan, and Hunan. Provinces with a RUP of less than 0.3 GJ occupy the majority of China.  3.4 Structural equation model of MSW's RUP and SDG progress We then used an SEM to understand the direct and indirect effects of MSW's RUP on SDG progress. Regression analysis can only correlate to one dependent variable, providing a direct effect by dealing with numerous independent variables. However, one of the shortcomings of regression analysis is that it is impossible to conclude the indirect effects. For example, Table S3 shows Pearson's r of 0.71 for SDG6 (clean water) and 0.67 for SDG8 (decent work and economic growth). However, the presence of indirect effects does not mean that MSW's RUP has a larger impact on SDG6. Therefore, SEM was used to explore the direct and indirect effects between MSW's RUP and SDGs. The direct and indirect impacts of MSW's RUP on each SDG can be immediately shown using an SEM. At the same time, the SEM addressed the issue that some SDGs, such as SDG1 (end poverty) and SDG8, are correlated with each other. Consequently, both SEM and regression analysis are used in this paper. It is challenging to directly compare the results of the regression and SEM analyses, but the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is consistent in both models. This suggests that all the correlations between MSW's RUP and SDGs can be considered robust. It should be noted that in the SEM, latent variables are not specified, and standardized path coefficients are obtained based on the path analysis. We also excluded variables with nonlinear relationships with MSW's RUP (such as SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG7 (clean energy), and SDG16 (peace and justice)) to deduce comparable standardized path coefficients. Finally, the direct and indirect relationships between MSW's RUP and each SDG were identified. In this model, the parameters of the evaluation model are all rationalized: P -value > 0.05, comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.90, normed fit index (NFI) > 0.90, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.08, incremental fit index (IFI) > 0.90. Using the results from the SEM, the direct and indirect effects of MSW's RUP with standardized path coefficients are shown in Fig.6  . As shown in Fig.6 , MSW's RUP has a significant positive effect on SDG8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG17 (global partnership), with direct effect path coefficients of 0.60 and 0.43. The direct effect path coefficients for SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) and SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities) are relatively low, both at 0.29. However, MSW's RUP has a significant negative effect on SDG13 (climate change) and SDG15 (ecosystem), with their path coefficients being -0.28 and -0.14, respectively. A considerable portion of the effects are factored in indirectly through SDG8, SDG9, and SDG15. As shown in Table 1  , the direct effect of MSW's RUP on SDG1 has a standardized path coefficient of -0.23, but the indirect effect through SDG8 and SDG9 is 0.17 and 0.04, respectively. This results in a net effect of -0.01 of MSW's RUP on SDG1 (end poverty), of which the direct effect accounts for 51.34 %, and the indirect effect through SDG8, SDG9 accounts for 48.66 %, almost equally divided. Similarly, 77.27 %, 16.56 %, and 34.84 % of the net effect of SDG3 (healthy lives), SDG6 (clean water), and SDG10 (reduce inequality) stem from indirect effects, respectively. This implies that multiple SDGs impact MSW's RUP in a direct or indirect form through SDG8, SDG9, and SDG15.  3.5 Impact of MSW's RUP on SDGs across China's provinces in 2021 Some indicators that are linearly related to MSW's RUP such as SDG1 (end poverty), SDG3 (healthy lives), and SDG6 (clean water) are selected to measure the regional heterogeneity of RUP for sustainable development in different provinces. We considered the MSW's RUP in 2005 as a reasonable baseline to represent the initial state of MSW's RUP for the counterfactual analysis. As shown in Fig.7  , the results show that MSW's RUP promotes a 2.64 % and 2.05 % increase in scores for SDG17 (global partnership) and SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), respectively, in 2021. This implies that if the MSW's RUP remains unchanged at the 2005 level, the scores for SDG17 and SDG8 will be reduced by 2.64 % and 2.05 %, respectively, in 2021. The MSW's RUP in Guangdong (20.95 %) and Zhejiang (19.91 %) are most affected by SDG17 because of their special geographic location, communication, and cooperation with foreign countries is essential, and the importation of foreign technology has a direct impact on the MSW's RUP (Cheng and Hu, 2010 ). The MSW's RUP in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Beijing are severely affected by SDG8, and economic development is also a primary prerequisite for promoting technological development (Abdulsomad, 1999 ). However, the MSW's RUP result has a significant negative impact on the SDG13 (climate change) with a 2.14 % decline by 2021, most notably in Tibet. This means that maintaining the low 2005 MSW's RUP would promote SDG13 (climate change) development, contrary to previous literature that MSW's RUP improved climate and ecosystem health (Menikpura et al., 2013 ). This is because there are still end pollutants present in the MSW resource utilization process, and the presence of these pollutants is a threat to ecologically healthy provinces, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Yunnan. With the popularity of MSW's RUP, SDG1 (end poverty) progressed by 1.35 %, SDG3 (healthy lives) by 0.34 %, SDG6 (clean water) by 0.30 %, SDG9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure) by 1.29 %, SDG10 (reduce inequality) by 0.58 %, and SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities) by 0.56 %. In addition, SDG15 (ecosystem) reduced by 1.08 %, with decreases ranging between -30 % and 16 %. Fig.7 (h) shows that there is regional heterogeneity in the impact of MSW's RUP on sustainable development. In 54.8 % of the provinces, the MSW's RUP was positively impacted. But nearly half of the provinces also have a negative impact of MSW's RUP on sustainable development (-0.35 % on average). Although the negative impacts are weak, if these provinces can identify the key factors that contribute to the negative impacts of MSW's RUP, they will make progress toward sustainable development.   4 Discussions Rapid population growth and urbanization have resulted in a dramatic increase in MSW in China's cities, and the uncontrollable increase in MSW is constraining sustainable urban development and posing challenges to China's SDG process which are difficult to address (Cheng et al., 2020 ; Dincer, 2000 ). In addition, the demand for fossil fuels is increasing. The United Nationsâ sustainable development goals, which also emphasize resource use, clean energy, and initiatives to combat climate change, are relevant to the management and disposal of MSW. Therefore, it is important to recognize the role of MSW's RUP in promoting progress toward the SDGs to advance the sustainability of urban resources. By analyzing the correlation between MSW's RUP and SDGs, we provide new insights into the state of sustainable development and urban resource sustainability in Chinese provinces. MSW is an important biomass resource (Hasan et al., 2021 ). Over the past few decades, WtE technologies have become an important initiative for MSW to be able to embody RUPs (Ding et al., 2021 ). WtE technologies not only reduced the size of MSW and provided renewable energy, it also utilized GHG to avoid their emission into the atmosphere, and improved the urban environment (Tan et al., 2015 ), as SDG7 (clean energy) and SDG11 (sustainable cities and communities) have made progress in the last two decades. MSW, as a renewable energy source, effectively reduces human demand for natural finite resources. The linear correspondences of SDG3 (healthy lives), SDG7 (clean energy), and SDG16 (peace and justice society) for changes in MSW's RUP showed a threshold value of RUP = 0.3 GJ (Fig. 4 ). When the RUP not exceeded the threshold of 0.3 GJ, the RUP can promote SDG7. MSW, as a renewable resource, can be used not only as an alternative to fossil fuels to reduce the demand for non-renewable energy (SDG7), but also can be converted into organic fertilizers to improve crop yields and quality (SDG2) (Menikpura et al., 2013 ). When the RUP exceeded the threshold, SDG7 negative correlation was the most important (R2  = 0.85), which is most likely due to the current WtE technology being limited, and the replacement of MSW with clean energy will also release pollutants, such as dioxin, which will make the clean energy of MSW no longer clean and thus limiting the development of SDGs (Mukherjee et al., 2020 ; Psomopolos et al., 2009 ). Provinces with MSW's RUP less than the threshold value accounted for the majority of Chinese provinces. It is mainly distributed in the northwestern inland and central regions of China (Fig. 5 ). This indicated that MSW's RUP promoted health (SDG3), supported sustainable energy (SDG7), and advanced the development of a fair and just society (SDG16) within a certain range, but after exceeding the threshold, it is necessary to rely on the support of other conditions, such as the control of pollutants in the atmosphere, water, and soil; and the increase of other biomass resources to replace fossil fuels. In the SEM analysis results, not only the direct effect of RUP on SDGs was explored, but also its indirect effect (Table 2  , Fig. 8  ). The direct effect of RUP on SDG8 (decent work and economic growth) was the most significant (0.60), and SDG8 advancement realizes the economic growth, which leads to the related industrial chain development of MSW resource treatment, improves the economic benefits and job opportunities (Mubeen and Buekens, 2019 ). RUP indirectly affects SDG1 (poverty eradication) (0.23) through SDG8, and MSW resource utilization industry development brings more employment opportunities and income sources for the poor groups. RUP has the second largest direct impact on SDG17 (global partnership) (0.43), and MSW resource utilization technology improvement requires international exchanges to make continuous progress, thus promoting foreign funds and talent introduction (Almanaseer et al., 2020 ). RUP indirectly affects SDG10 (reduce inequality) (0.45) through SDG17, which may be because RUP reduces MSW resource waste and increases social and environmental justice. However, there is a negative direct effect of RUP on SDG13 (climate change) (-0.28). This is because WtE technology has not yet been popularized in China, and the waste disposal methods of incineration and landfill are used in most areas, which have negative impacts on the ecosystem, such as landfill waste occupying ecological land. Previous studies have shown that WtE technology does not reduce GHG emissions, which is also a possible reason (Shadbahr et al., 2022 ). Another negative direct impact of the RUP is on SDG15 (ecosystem) (-0.14), due to the potential to develop the RUP, which would increase land use for the construction of the WtE plant, with impacts on the ecosystem and environment (VaverkovÃ¡, 2019 ). Our study also uses a counterfactual model to explore the differences among provinces in the impact of RUP on SDGs. For example, SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), which has the strongest direct positive impact of RUP in the SEM results, is shown in the counterfactual test result, which shows that RUP promotes SDG8 progress by 2.08 % at the national level, with Beijing contributing the most (13.87 %), and negative contributions appearing in Heilongjiang and Yunnan provinces (-14.19 %, -8.24 %), which may be because the utilization of MSW resources in places such as Heilongjiang Province potential is weak and fail to promote the economic progress of the region from that perspective. SDG13 (climate change), the negative impact of RUP is the most significant in the SEM results, and is also confirmed in counterfactual test results where RUP development is not beneficial to climate improvement, and the impact is particularly significant for Tibet (-47.28 %). Therefore, when the country promotes MSW to realize RUP development, achieve economic progress, and social equity, it should also pay attention to not destroying the existing plants and natural ecosystems. The positive contribution of RUP to SDG17 (global partnership) is the strongest (2.64 %), and Guangdong and Fujian Province have the most prominent contribution (20.96 %, 19.50 %), which is closely related to their coastal geographic location, where the coast promotes the exchange with foreign countries and the innovative waste-to-energy technology introduction; Tibet's performance in this indicator is the opposite (-14.86 %). Our results are partially consistent with the results of previous studies on the RUP-SDG relationship (AlQattan et al., 2018 ). In the RUP function of MSW, it can usually be categorized into energy potential and material potential (Bueno et al., 2015 ; Chen and Chen, 2013 ). Energy potential includes biogas and biomass pellets (Hamzah et al., 2019 ), material potential includes organic fertilizers and bio-materials (Biswal et al., 2020 ), whichever potential will have a significant role in the progress of SDG (Fig.8 ). However, the results of previous studies only consider SDGs that MSW's RUP directly influences, such as improving the climate (SDG13), serving as a source of clean energy (SDG7), and building a sustainable society (SDG11) (AlQattan et al., 2018 ). Our study considered not only direct but also indirect factors to jointly explore the multidimensional objectives of MSW's RUP to achieve the SDGs, and clarified the synergistic relationship between them. Although this study innovatively focuses on the importance of MSW's RUP for the development of SDGs and explores the fact that RUP is not contributing to the development of all SDG goals, there are some limitations in this study in some aspects, such as the spatial scale of the evaluation would have been evaluated at a finer resolution if it had been at the municipal level. In future research, the contribution of MSW's RUP to urban SDGs can be more accurately reflected by investigating SDG data and RUP data at a finer resolution.  5 Conclusions MSW's RUP is able to support sustainable urban development through the formation of clean energy or biomaterials. This study systematically assesses the progress of China's SDGs from 2005 to 2021 using 83 indicators related to SDG development and uses regression analysis and SEM to analyze the direct and indirect impacts of MSW's RUP on the SDGs. Finally, a counterfactual analysis was used to determine the regional heterogeneity of this impact. The study found that the MSW's RUP contributed to the achievement of a number of the SDGs and showed that the MSW's RUP has a negative impact on the sustainable process of climate change (SDG13). There is a threshold in the relationship between MSW's RUP and some SDGs with a value of 0.3 GJ. There is regional heterogeneity in the impact of MSW's RUP on SDGs, with positive impacts in 54.8 % of the provinces and weaker negative impacts in the remaining provinces. Improvement of MSW management, targeted promotion of WtE projects in sub-regions, and comprehensive promotion of available resources for MSW can contribute to the rapid development of urban SDGs. Other initiatives to prevent climate change need to be developed rapidly, which will contribute to the process of achieving carbon neutrality in China by 2060.
