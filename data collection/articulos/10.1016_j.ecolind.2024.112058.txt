                  Monitoring land degradation and urban expansion is crucial for sustainable development and environmental stewardship. It helps protect arable land, ensure food security, mitigate climate change impacts, and guide urban growth while minimizing environmental harm, thus advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
                  This study focuses on the application of the Trends.Earth tool, following the UN-SDG indicator framework, to assess land changes, urban expansion, and drought vulnerability in the central east region of Yunnan Province, China, during the period 2000 to 2020.
                  The analysis reveals significant trends in land transformation and urban growth. Notably, the central Yunnan region demonstrated a positive trajectory, with 69.58% experiencing land improvement and 8.55% undergoing degradation. Urban areas expanded dramatically, with Kunming City growing threefold from 2000 to 2015 raising concerns about sustainable land management. Drought vulnerability assessments unveil the temporal variation and the extent of impact on the population.
                  This research underscores the importance of remote sensing and its role in achieving the SDGs. By providing a comprehensive assessment of land dynamics, urbanization patterns, and environmental vulnerability. As Yunnan Province grapples with both developmental aspirations and ecological conservation imperatives, this study serves as a foundation for informed decision-making to balance economic growth and environmental protection.

It helps protect arable land, ensure food security, mitigate climate change impacts, and guide urban growth while minimizing environmental harm, thus advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). This study focuses on the application of the Trends.Earth tool, following the UN-SDG indicator framework, to assess land changes, urban expansion, and drought vulnerability in the central east region of Yunnan Province, China, during the period 2000 to 2020. The analysis reveals significant trends in land transformation and urban growth. Notably, the central Yunnan region demonstrated a positive trajectory, with 69.58% experiencing land improvement and 8.55% undergoing degradation. Urban areas expanded dramatically, with Kunming City growing threefold from 2000 to 2015 raising concerns about sustainable land management. Drought vulnerability assessments unveil the temporal variation and the extent of impact on the population. This research underscores the importance of remote sensing and its role in achieving the SDGs. By providing a comprehensive assessment of land dynamics, urbanization patterns, and environmental vulnerability. As Yunnan Province grapples with both developmental aspirations and ecological conservation imperatives, this study serves as a foundation for informed decision-making to balance economic growth and environmental protection.

This negative trend is characterized by a long-term decline or loss of biological productivity, ecological integrity, and overall value to human communities (IPCC, 2019 ). The consequences of land degradation affect food security, climate change, environmental hazards, and the alarming loss of biodiversity and essential ecosystem services (Toor et al., 2020 ). According to alarming statistics, 3.2 billion people are directly affected by land degradation (Boer & Hannam, 2019 ), and is estimated 9.7 billion by 2050 (FAO, 2009 ). Approximately 25 percent of the Earth’s total land area has already suffered from varying degrees of degradation (IPBES, 2018 ), due to unsustainable agriculture practices more than 20 billion tons of fertile soil was being lost per year, exacerbating the already complex web of climate-related challenges (UKEssays, 2018) ). These degraded lands encompass a wide spectrum of ecosystems, ranging from fertile croplands to fragile rangelands, leaving no region untouched by the impact (Chasek P, 2022). If this trend continues, by 2050 more than 90 percent of the Earth’s land areas could become heavily degraded (Lü, Fu, & Lin, 2015 ). In China over 40 % of the land area (3 million km2 ) is adversely affected by wind and water erosion, loss of grazing, deforestation, and salinization (Berry, 2000 ). Soil losses due to erosion are estimated at around five billion tonnes per annum (Bennett & Kontoleon, 2003 ). In Yunnan Province, activities like open-pit mining have caused severe land degradation (Dong et al., 2020 ). Natural factors and climate change have also contributed to this degradation (Sun et al., 2021 ). In the pursuit of a better and more sustainable future for humanity, the United Nations (UN) introduced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (United Nations, 2015 ) − a visionary roadmap encompassing 17 interconnected objectives. These goals, adopted in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, provide a comprehensive framework to address pressing global challenges while fostering prosperity, equity, and environmental stewardship (National geographic, n.d. ). Indicators 11 and 15 of the SDGs assume particular significance in this context. SDG 11 aims to create sustainable, inclusive, safe, and resilient cities, while SDG 15 focuses on preserving and restoring terrestrial ecosystems, recognizing the crucial role they play in sustaining life and fostering biodiversity (UN, 2018 ). Those Indicators are focus on enhancing urban planning and management practices, as well as addresses the urgent need to protect, restore, and sustainably manage terrestrial ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss (DESA, n.d.). China is an emerging economic world leader and growing consumer of resources (Grosse, Gamso, & Nelson, 2021 ) To ensure a sustainable future, China must pay attention to moving in a sustainable direction, especially focusing on Environmental, Social, and Governance factors, local and national policies, and International Cooperation on Climate and Sustainability (WEF, 2023 ). According to an analysis of China’s National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda (Li et al., 2021 ), advisory instruments and ecological sustainability dimensions need to be strengthened. A recent study of causal interactions among Sustainable Development Goals in China concludes that China needs to improve its climate regulations (Cao et al., 2023 ).“In the context of our study, we emphasize the critical importance of addressing land degradation and urban expansion in China, as these phenomena are significant contributors to the realization of sustainable development goals. In Yunnan Province, despite its reputation for diverse ecosystems and abundant biodiversity, land degradation poses a significant challenge. Deforestation, soil erosion, and unsustainable land use practices are among the key factors contributing to this issue (World Bank Group, 2019 ). The province's fragile ecosystem is particularly vulnerable to disruptions caused by climate variability, agricultural expansion, and rapid urbanization (Wang et al., 2022 ). Urban Agglomeration agreement further fueling urban expansion particularly rapid, specially in the central east of the region in cities like Kunming and Yuxi (Zhang et al., 2019 ). Yunnan has implemented some programs related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as the SDG Pilot Village Project for local efforts to address issues such as women's poverty reduction, and rural revitalization (UNDP, n.d. ), and recently some studies in the south are of the province assessed the state of the land degradation according SDGs guidelines (T. Wang et al., 2020 ). While the origins of remote sensing trace back to military and scientific applications during the mid-20th century, the exponential growth of Earth observation satellites in recent decades has propelled this field into the forefront of contemporary environmental research. (Efremenko & Kokhanovsky, 2021 ). In the pursuit of sustainable global development, remote sensing, coupled with satellite Earth observations, has emerged as a global network of programs and platforms that monitor and study the evolution of these goals (GEO EO4SDG initiative, & CEOS Ad-Hoc Team on SDGs, 2021 ). In 2018, China launched the Big Earth Data Science Engineering Program (CASEarth) through the Chinese Academy of Sciences to study how Big Earth Data can facilitate the implementation of SDGs (CBAS, n.d. ). Additionally, in 2020, China announced the establishment of an International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals (CBAS). CBAS aims to harness big data to serve the 2030 Agenda and features multidisciplinary research related to Earth system science, social and economic sciences, as well as sustainability science. The utilization of remote sensing data has garnered significant attention in the assessment of sustainability goals in China over the past two decades (Ekmen & Kocaman, 2023 ). Kadhim et al. (2016)  conducted a comprehensive analysis of advances in Remote Sensing Applications for Urban Sustainability in China up to 2016. A more recent study, 'From Pixels to Sustainability' (Ekmen & Kocaman, 2023 ), investigates remote sensing research on SDG 11 from 2016 to 2023. Additionally, Gao et al. (2021)  propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the sustainable development of cities in China, integrating urban sustainability, remote sensing, and big data. Furthermore, 'Remote Sensing for Sustainability,' authored by Qihao Weng (2016) , serves as a valuable resource bridging remote sensing and sustainability science, with a particular focus on China. This study aims to contribute to the pursuit of sustainable development goals in line with international guidelines through the implementation of remote sensing and GIS tools to assess the land degradation status in the central region of Yunnan Province during he last two decades.  2 Study area and data sources 2.1 Study area Yunnan is a landlocked province in the southwest of the People's Republic of China. According to government's data (SRD, 2023 ) The province is approximately 394,000 Km2  and has a population of 48,3 million. Its borders are the provinces of Guizhou, Sichuan, autonomous regions of Guangxi, and Tibet as well as Southeast Asian countries: Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar (CCP, 2023). In this study, we are going to take the central-east area of the Yunnan, including Kunming, Qujing prefecture, Yuxi prefecture, and Chuxiong prefectures [Fig. 1  ] (Statistical Bureau of Yunnan Province, 2018 ). Central Yunnan Province, is characterized by diverse topography, ranging from high mountains to deep valleys, and a subtropical monsoon climate with distinct wet and dry seasons (Xw & Walker, 1986 ). The region boasts rich biodiversity, including various ecosystems such as forests, grasslands, and wetlands, supporting a wide range of plant and animal species (Y. Yang et al., 2004 ). Remote sensing studies have highlighted significant land cover and land use changes in the province, reflecting both natural processes and human activities (R. Yang et al., 2022 ). These four prefectures represent 44.1 % of Yunnan's population, totaling 18,856,863 individuals (City Population, 2020) and 61.6 % of the province’s GDP (Yunnan Provincial Government, 2020 ). Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan province, with an urban population of over 8 million serves as the economic core of this central area (Zhang et al., 2021 ). In total this 4 prefectures have approximately 93,285 km2  (Statistic Research Department, 2023). Even though Yunnan is not a very developed province, its urban and rural areas have been changing during the last decades, these changes, like in many other regions break the ecological balance and increase city pressure (Yang et al., 2023 ). Thus we chose this province’s prefectures to apply Trends.Earth methodology to analyze UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Indicators 11/15 in this region.  2.2 Data sources In this study, we use different sources of global data [Table 1  ], most of them from Trends.Earth global data set (Trends.Earth, 2023 ).   3 Methodology The methodology employed adheres to the official UN SDG indicator framework (UNDESA, 2018) and its implementation strategy as proposed in the UNCCD Good Practice  Guidance (Sims et al., 2021 ). Notably, the UNCCD is the designated custodian agency for SDG indicator 15.3.1, a metric designed to gauge progress toward achieving SDG target 15.3 [Fig. 2  ]. In the scope of this research, we leveraged the Trends.Earth tool to analyze and report on the SDG indicator within the central Yunnan region using a rich dataset spanning the past two decades. Trends.Earth (“Trends.Earth,” 2020) serves as a complimentary, open-source resource aimed at comprehending changes in land use and the underlying factors driving these changes. This tool draws from a comprehensive array of data sources, ranging from global datasets to locally tailored maps. As a decision support tool, Trends.Earth contributes to both SDG 15.3.1 and SDG 11.3.1 which pertains to sustainable cities reporting. It operates as a freely available plugin within the open-source software QGIS. Trends.Earth facilitates the generation of time series data for significant spatial indicators of land use transformation, encompassing both degradation and enhancement (Runfola et al., 2020 ). The tool holds the potential to integrate other pertinent indicators, including UNCCD Strategic Objective 3 (SO 3)-Drought and land degradation. 3.1 Assessing SDG Indicator 15.3.1 To assess the area degraded, SDG Indicator 15.3.1 needs information from 3 sub-indicators: Productivity, Vegetation Land cover, and Soil organic carbon (UNCCD, 2017 ). Next, we describe how each sub-indicator is calculated, its characteristics, and the data used in each case to obtain SDG indicators 15.3.1. 3.1.1 Productivity As stated by the (United Nations, 2020 ), land productivity signifies the biological capacity of the land, serving as the foundational source of sustenance for humanity through the provision of food, fiber, and fuel. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) reflects the net quantity of carbon assimilated post-photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration within a defined timeframe. It is usually measured in units like kg/ha/yr, and by utilizing remote sensing data is possible to derive NPP-related indicators. With high-resolution data, contemporary tools like LPDynR enable the computation of land productivity dynamics (Rotllan-Puig et al., 2021 ). Similarly, China's SDG Big Data Platform (Statista Research Department, 2020 ) has developed high-resolution LPD data. However, in our case, we were unable to obtain access to this data, so we ultimately relied on using NDVI. A prevalent surrogate for NPP is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Xu et al., 2011 ), calculated from data in the red and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Trends.Earth, bi-weekly MODIS and AVHRR products are utilized to compute annual integrals of NDVI. The trajectory metric gauges the pace of primary productivity changes over time. By conducting a pixel-level linear regression, Trends.Earth identifies areas witnessing shifts in primary productivity during the studied period. A positively significant trend in NDVI may indicate a potential enhancement in land condition, possibly resulting from improved soil moisture, better nutrient availability, or successful land management practices. In areas previously affected by degradation, such as deforestation, overgrazing, or drought, a positive NDVI trend signifies vegetation recovery and regeneration. while a negative significant trend could signal degradation potential, often caused by factors like water scarcity, soil degradation, deforestation and intensive agriculture (Huang et al., 2020 ). Upon aggregation, this sub-indicator yield a five-class classification: Improving, Stable, Stable but Stressed, and Early Signs of Declining [Fig. 3  ] (Sims et al., 2021 ). Improving category represents land areas where productivity is increasing over time, land with consistent and unchanging productivity falls into Stable category, Stable but Stressed class is land that remains stable but exhibits signs of stress, Early Signs of Declining class shows land with early indications of decline in productivity, and Declining represents land with a clear reduction in productivity.3.1.2 Land cover    The evaluation of alterations in land cover necessitates the availability of land cover maps encompassing the study area for both the baseline and target years. These maps should possess an acceptable level of accuracy and be constructed in a manner conducive to credible comparisons (Strahler et al., 2006 ). While Trends.Earth employs the ESA CCI land cover maps as the default dataset, local maps can also be incorporated. In this particular study, we utilized the United Nations initiative on Global Geo-spatial Information Management's Land Cover Datasets, with a 30 m resolution [Fig. 4  ], spanning from the year 2001 to 2020 improving the final outcomes for SDG 15.3.1 indicator [Fig. 5  ]. Drawing from localized insights into the conditions within the study area and the ongoing land degradation processes there, we can employ a land cover change matrix [Table 2  ]. This matrix serves to identify transitions that correspond to degradation (−), improvement (+), or the absence of change in terms of land condition (0) (Sims et al., 2021 ). In our specific scenario, we modified the default value for grassland (which includes shurbs and sparsely vegetated areas) to denote degradation (−). This adjustment is warranted since Chinese environmental authorities categorize the transformation of grassland into cropland as land degradation, as this transition entails altering the original natural land cover into an artificial one (Rodríguez et al., 2016 ).3.1.3 Soil organic carbon    The third sub-indicator aimed at monitoring land degradation within the SDG framework involves the measurement of alterations in soil organic carbon (SOC) over the designated reporting duration. SOC signifies the carbon stored within soil organic matter and plays a pivotal role in maintaining soil health, fertility, and essential ecosystem services, including food production(Soil organic carbon, n.d.). Trends.Earth integrates a method combining land cover and SOC data. This fusion enables the estimation of changes in SOC and the identification of areas that might be experiencing degradation [Fig. 6  ].  3.1.4 Combining indicators The integration of the three SDG 15.3.1 sub-indicators is done following the one-out all-out rule, this means that if an area was identified as potentially degraded by any of the sub-indicators, then that area will be considered potentially degraded for reporting purposes (Sims et al., 2021 ). The Trend, State, and Land performance integration will deliver three final categories, Improving, Degrading and Stable land categories [Table 3  ].   3.2 Assessing drought vulnerability Indicator Aligned with UNCCD Strategic Objective 3 (SO 3), the mission is to mitigate, adapt to, and proficiently manage drought-induced impacts, thereby augmenting the resilience of both vulnerable populations and ecosystems. National Geographic magazine defines a drought as a period during which an area or region encounters subnormal precipitation levels, consequently triggering a domino effect on societal livelihoods and economic sectors (National Geographic Society, 2023 ). To adhere to the endorsed methodology for national reporting on GPG-SO3, the Trends.Earth tool deploys a tripartite index computation: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Gridded Global Population Dataset, and the Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI). These indices collectively culminate in the creation of raster maps that delineate regions and populations exposed to varying degrees of drought stress during the study period. The formula utilized [formula 1] to ascertain the percentage of land within distinct drought intensity categories juxtaposes the land area corresponding to each previously established drought intensity class against the total land area(1) P ij   = area  ij   Totalarea   x 100     Formula 1 Pij : is the proportion of land under the drought intensity class i in the year. areaij : is the land area under the drought intensity class i in the reporting year. Total area is all the total land area. The assessment of Drought Vulnerability relies upon the utilization of the Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI) [Formula 2], DVI quantifies a region’s susceptibility to the impacts of drought by considering various factors related to exposure (likelihood of experiencing drought events), sensitivity (vulnerability of socio-economic and environmental systems), and adaptive capacity (ability to cope with and recover from drought impacts) within the area of study (Engström et al., 2020 ). A comprehensive amalgamation of three distinct components reflective of population susceptibility to drought events: i) social, ii) economic, and iii) infrastructural. Presently, the DVI does not encompass elements centered on ecological or ecosystem vulnerabilities. Within the scope of Trends.Earth, access is granted to the global default DVI dataset established by the Joint Research Centre  (JRC). This establishment, has meticulously devised a framework that fuses 15 economic, social, and infrastructural facets intricately linked to drought vulnerability, all derived from an array of worldwide data repositories (Riahi et al., 2017 ).(2) dv  i  = Soc  i  + Econ  i  + Infr  i   3      Formula 2 Soc i, Econ i, and Infr i are the social, economic, and infrastructural vulnerability factors for region i.  3.3 Assessing SDG Indicator 11.3.1 Target 11.3 strives to promote inclusive and sustainable urbanization, along with the capacity for participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management across all nations by 2030 (UN-Habitat, 2019 ). To monitor the progress towards attaining this goal, the United Nations introduced Indicator 11.3.1, which gauges the effectiveness of cities in utilizing land resources (Trends.Earth, 2023 ). This assessment enables city authorities and policymakers to anticipate the demand for essential services, pinpoint areas for potential expansion, and proactively influence sustainable urban development. 3.3.1 Urban land consumption Urban land consumption pertains to the transformation of natural landscapes into man-made structures to accommodate the residential, social, and economic needs of urban populations (Hu et al., 2021 ). Indicator 11.3.1 is defined as the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate. In order to compute this indicator, information on the urban extent and population in at least two moments in time are needed, and even more if we are interested in assessing the change in the indicator over time. Leveraging earth observation data enables us to approximate the size of built-up areas within a city. Subsequently, through the application of spatial analysis algorithms, we can estimate the proportions of distinct elements within the urban environment, such as buildings, open spaces, water bodies, and more (UN-Habitat, 2019 ). In the case of Trends.Earth, harnesses the computational power of Google Earth Engine's supercomputers, utilizing the complete Landsat archive spanning from 1997 to 2019, coupled with the GMIS dataset (Brown de Colstoun et al., 2017 ). This combination allows for the computation of a sequence of impervious surface indices accessible at a global scale and with a 30-meter resolution. These indices provide insights into urban expansion for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.  3.3.2 Trends.earth urban Mapper The Trends.Earth Urban Mapper is a Google Earth Engine and Trends.Earth platform (Trends.Earth Urban Mapper, n.d. ) that serves as a valuable tool for exploring the impact of altering various parameters on the extent of built-up area data, which subsequently informs changes in urban expansion. Before initiating the analysis within QGIS, it is necessary to utilize the Urban Mapper platform to define the extent of built-up areas by assigning a sequence of three threshold values; Impervious Surface Index (ISI), Night Time Lights Index (NTL), and Water Frequency Index (WFI), which are integral to estimating the built-up area for the specified area of interest [Fig. 7  ]. Impervious Surface Index (ISI) encompass artificial land surfaces that obstruct water infiltration, such as roads, parking lots, and rooftops (Feng & Fan, 2021 ). Within Trends.Earth Urban Mapper, the ISI is quantified on a scale of 0 to 100, where higher values indicate a greater percentage of impervious surface in the 30-meter pixel. Night Time Lights Index (NTL) Is a pivotal source for gauging human activities across various scales, reflecting socioeconomic activities and urbanization intensity (Li et al., 2020 ). In some cases, ISI might yield elevated values for areas with dry soil or rocks, due to spectral properties resembling those of man-made impervious surfaces. To counter this, the Night Time Lights Index (NTL) is employed. Water Frequency Index (WFI) is a dynamic aspect of coastal and riverine environments, where water might inundate land areas or humans might encroach into water bodies (Trends.Earth, 2023 ). Reflecting these dynamics, Urban Mapper integrates a water frequency dataset (Pekel et al., 2016 ).    4 Results 4.1 SDG Indicator 15.3, land degradation The outcome of Indicator 15.3.1 exhibits a positive trajectory [Fig. 8  ]. The results showcase an advancement of 64,930.65 km2  in land area. Additionally, an expanse of 19,561.43 km2 , accounting for 20.96 % of the total study area, remains relatively stable. Contrastingly, an area of 7,979.7 km2 , constituting 8.55 % of the total study area, indicates degradation. Notably, this degradation predominantly clusters around newly developed urban expansion projects and burgeoning suburban regions. Over the past two decades, the central-east region of Yunnan province has demonstrated some environmental progress. In the context of land cover transformation, the expansion of tree/forest cover area from 2001 to 2020 registered an increment of 2,896.80 km2 . However, this increment merely constitutes 6 % of the overall alterations [Fig. 9  ]. Conversely, the expansion of artificial land area has surged by a substantial 316 %. A cumulative area of 984.56 km2  of new artificial land has emerged over the preceding two decades. This paradigm underscores the prevailing trajectory of the province's development, predominantly emphasizing industrialization and urban expansion. Regarding wetlands, although the alteration exhibits a positive trend at 61 %, it translates to a mere acquisition of 17.65 km2  of increased wetland coverage. Conversely, within the domain of diminishing land change, the dynamics of grassland, cropland, and water manifest −1,048.70 km2  (a reduction of 13 %), −2,841.02 km2  (a decline of 7 %), and −9.28 km2  (a decrement of 1 %) respectively. A significant portion of the shift in grassland is intertwined with the recovery of tree-covered land. Notably, a substantial conversion of 2,307.12 km2  of grassland into forested areas has been observed until the year 2020. [Table 4  ], [Table 5  ] and [Table 6  ] show the summary of SDG 15.3.1 Indicator from 2001 −2020 in the study area.  4.2 Drought vulnerability The culmination of the Drought Vulnerability assessment yields a group of maps and comprehensive reports that depict the dynamics of drought across the study region throughout the study period time. During 2011/2012, the region exhibited the most pronounced vulnerability to drought, encompassing areas spanning from moderate to extreme drought conditions. In contrast, the period of 2001/2002 marked the epoch of least vulnerability, characterized by mild drought and predominantly normal conditions across the majority of the study area [Fig. 10  ]. The generated reports tell us that, during 2011, a staggering 10,172,070 individuals were exposed to extreme drought conditions. This demographic translates to approximately 58.38 % of the total regional population for that particular year. Similarly, during the same period, 5,138,456 individuals (29.49 %) encountered severe drought conditions. In terms of land affected by drought, the years 2009 and 2011 stood out as particularly arid phases. In 2009, a considerable land expanse measuring 37,675.58 km2  (40.38 %) faced extreme drought conditions, while 27,513.74 km2  (29.49 %) grappled with severe drought conditions. Conversely, during the 2011/2012 period, the landscape depicted an even more extensive impact, with 51,267.45 km2  (54.94 %) and 26,826.77 km2  (28.75 %) experiencing extreme drought indices.  4.3 SDG Indicator 11.3.1, urban expansion In the case of Indicator 11.3.1, the findings mirror those observed in Indicator 15.3.1, revealing a substantial surge in urban expansion within recent decades [Fig. 11  ]. Land consumption has intensified across all urban and suburban sectors within the study region, with a pronounced concentration in Kunming City, the capital of Yunnan province. Over 15 years, from 2000 to 2015, Kunming City's built area has remarkably ballooned from 502,911 km2  to over 1299.249 km2 , reflecting more than a double increase in size. This trend is supported by official data from China Economic Network Data (CEI, n.d.), indicating that as of 2021, Kunming district, including its towns, covered 2,459.76 km2 , affirming significant urban expansion throughout the district [Fig. 12  ]. Concurrently, the cities of Chuxiong, Yuxi, and Qujing have undergone swift urban development over the same 15-year period. Qujing, the second-largest city within the study area, expanded from 72.55 km2  in 2000 to 132.20 km2  by 2015 [Fig. 12 ]. Yuxi, commencing with a comparable area of 72.32 km2  in 2000, exhibited a slightly less accelerated growth trajectory compared to Qujing, culminating in an area of 110.49 km2  by 2015. Lastly, Chuxiong City witnessed a transformation from 32.7339 km2  to 57.20 km2  during this period of robust urban expansion. This surge in rapid urban expansion significantly corresponds with the outcomes of Indicator 15.3.1, as the most pronounced alteration in land area was observed within the artificial land change category. This transformation has tangibly affected water bodies proximate to urban areas, consequently altering the surfaces of croplands and grasslands.   5 Discussion The findings of this study shed light on significant trends in land transformation and urbanization within central Yunnan Province, offering valuable insights into the region's socio-economic and environmental dynamics. The study identifies urbanization pressure and land-use change as primary drivers of land transformation in the region. The consequences of these trends include ecological impacts such as habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as social implications such as reduced quality of life and public health concerns associated with urban sprawl. 5.1 Land transformation Trends The results of Indicator 15.3.1 reveal a mixed trajectory in land degradation across the study area. While there is a notable advancement in land area, particularly in stable regions, it is concerning to observe degradation in certain pockets, predominantly clustered around urban expansion projects and suburban regions. This finding underscores the complex interplay between rapid urbanization and environmental sustainability. The emphasis on industrialization and urban expansion has led to a significant increase in artificial land area, overshadowing the modest expansion of tree/forest cover (Y. Yang et al., 2020 ). Similar studies show that Cental Yunnan Province has encountered substantial shifts in land use and vegetation over the last few decades, land erosion has increase notably (Vitekere, Hua, & Jiang, 2020 ) (Chaparro et al., 2017 ). This pattern of sacrificing ecological stability for economic and industrial development is replicated in other provinces as well (Cao et al., 2023 ). Moreover, the decline in grassland and cropland areas highlights the need for balanced land management strategies that prioritize ecological conservation alongside economic development (R Sedricke Lapuz et al., 2022 ).  5.2 Drought vulnerability The assessment of drought vulnerability presents a sobering picture of the region's susceptibility to extreme weather events. The observed patterns reveal recurring episodes of severe drought conditions, with certain years experiencing particularly acute impacts on both land and population. The Yunnan Province, particularly our study area, faces a substantial threat from climate change (He et al., 2021 ), which contributes to increased instances of floods and drought seasons (Yu et al., 2016 ). The extensive exposure of individuals to extreme drought conditions underscores the urgent need for proactive measures to enhance resilience and adaptive capacity. This includes targeted interventions in water resource management, agricultural practices, and disaster preparedness to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of drought on vulnerable communities.  5.3 SDG Indicator 11.3.1, urban expansion The findings regarding urban expansion mirror the broader trends observed in land degradation, with rapid urbanization exerting significant pressure on land resources. Kunming City emerges as a focal point of urban growth, experiencing a substantial increase in built-up area over the past decade (Cai & Yang, 2023 ). This expansion is not unique to Kunming but is also evident in Qujing, and Yuxi cities within the study area. Concurrently, the total area of construction land has markedly increased, leading to a phenomenon of reckless expansion and utilization of construction land (Zhang et al., 2020 ). The concurrent growth of urban areas and the corresponding decline in natural land cover underscore the imperative for sustainable urban planning and management practices (China’s Environmental Problems, n.d. ). Addressing the challenges of urban expansion requires a holistic approach that balances economic development with environmental conservation and social equity.  5.4 Role of remote sensing and sustainable development Goals (SDGs) Remote sensing technology plays a pivotal role in monitoring land dynamics and guiding policy decisions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By providing comprehensive data on land changes, remote sensing enables policymakers to make informed decisions aligned with the objectives of SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 15 (Life on Land) (European Space Agency, 2021 ). Trends.Earth tool emerges as a significant means for comprehending the genuine situation surrounding SDGs and making informed decisions at various administrative levels. However, simply obtaining results, maps, and conclusions according to institutional rules and guidelines (IEC, 2022 ) isn't sufficient. It's also crucial to engage in a reflective analysis of what the indicators' outcomes convey. Implications and Future Directions  The findings of this study have several implications for both policy and practice. Firstly, there is a pressing need for integrated land management strategies that prioritize sustainable development while safeguarding natural ecosystems and resources. This includes targeted interventions to mitigate land degradation, enhance drought resilience, and promote sustainable urbanization. Secondly, the study underscores the importance of robust data and monitoring systems to track changes in land use and environmental conditions effectively. Future research should focus on refining models and methodologies for assessing land degradation and drought vulnerability, incorporating socio-economic factors and climate change projections. Finally, translating research findings into actionable policy measures and community-based initiatives is essential for fostering resilience and adaptive capacity at the local and regional levels. By leveraging interdisciplinary approaches and stakeholder engagement, policymakers can chart a course towards a more sustainable and resilient future for Yunnan province and beyond.   6 Conclusions The analysis of SDG Indicators in this paper reveals a positive trend, however, approximately 7,979.7 Km2 , suffered from land degradation in central east Yunnan, primarily concentrated around new urban expansion and suburban growth zones, with a striking increase of 316 % in the last decade. It reflects economic priorities, the shift towards industrialization and urban expansion, as well as emphasizes the challenge of maintaining agricultural lands. The results insinuate an evident contradiction between economic growth and environmental preservation, this situation holds implications for resource allocation, environmental preservation, and the need for informed urban planning in the study area. The application of the Trends.Earth tool, following the guidelines set forth by UN SDGs and UNCCD frameworks, underscores its methodological soundness in evaluating environmental indicators. Its adaptability to regional contexts, such as the Yunnan Province, signifies its practicality in promoting sustainable development goals. In this study Trends.Eerth results indicate that central Yunnan requires a meticulous balancing of urbanization's benefits with conservation imperatives. Policymakers in central east Yunnan are encouraged to develop new sustainable development strategies grounded in considerations of both population growth and land carrying capacity. These measures are crucial for mitigating the impact of human activities, especially urbanization, which is particularly pronounced in Kunming, the provincial capital. Policy recommendations include the implementation of smart urban planning measures to protect arable land and green spaces, the adoption of ecosystem-based approaches to urban development, and meaningful community engagement in sustainable land management decisions. Several limitations exist within this study. Firstly, our analysis relied on moderate-resolution geospatial datasets, underscoring the necessity for further exploration into the potential impact of high-resolution earth observation data on our findings. Secondly, achieving a comprehensive understanding of how human activities influence the degradation of forests and natural areas is essential for crafting more effective policies. This aspect will be the primary focus of future research endeavors, where the integration of human geography aspects is expected to be crucial.
