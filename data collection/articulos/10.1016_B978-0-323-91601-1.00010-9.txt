               Cellular agriculture refers to a broad set of emerging technologies that draw upon research in genomics and synthetic biology to produce biological compounds. Much of the interest in cellular agriculture stems from its potential as a way of producing high-quality proteins and other nutrients with reduced environmental impact. Cellular agriculture techniques are rapidly nearing commercial scales of production, in part due to the application of knowledge and techniques produced through genomics research related to gene expression, editing, and genome-scale data analytics. However, much remains unknown and there is little rigorous evidence to test these assertions. This chapter applies the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a lens through which to examine protein production using cellular agriculture, to understand how it may contribute to the development of more sustainable and resilient food system. We examine two emerging approaches to cellular agriculture—cultured meat and fermentation-derived dairy—and explore both the complexity and knowledge gaps that need to be filled to ensure these tools are deployed to help create a more sustainable future for all. This chapter concludes by proposing an agenda for future research and policy development.

Keywords Cellular agriculture  Sustainability  UN Sustainable Development Goals  Protein  Cell culture  Fermentation   Introduction One of the most effective ways individual consumers can reduce their direct impact on the environment is through their dietary choices (Machovina et al., 2015 ; Willett et al., 2019 ). In particular, “plant-forward” diets (defined as diets that focus on consuming plants and minimizing animal products) and “flexitarianism” (diets that intentionally reduce animal products) have emerged in public and academic debates as important strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, conserve habitat and biodiversity, and decrease agricultural water consumption and fertilizer usage. Accordingly, the advent of alternative protein (Tuomisto, 2019 ) products is positioned as a way of helping reduce humanity’s impact on the environment (Mattick, 2018 ). Such promising protein production techniques include “cellular agriculture,” which involves growing animal-analogue proteins in industrial or laboratory settings using cell cultures and tissue-engineering or fermentation-based techniques. Although there are reasons to be optimistic about the potential contributions of cellular agriculture to developing more sustainable food systems, tremendous complexity and uncertainty remain. Many scholars and practitioners, for instance, point out that animals are an important component of a sustainable agroecosystem, providing valuable ecosystem services on many farms such as nutrient cycling (Parker, 2020 ). Second, given the technologies around cellular agriculture are extremely nascent and have not yet been taken to scale, it has been impossible to conduct a full life cycle assessment of these technologies (Lynch and Pierrehumbert, 2019 ; Newman et al., 2021 ). Third, animal agriculture is a vital source of livelihoods for hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers, many of whom live in the developing world where they have limited access to markets or high-quality protein (Rota and Urbani, 2021 ). How might a widespread shift to cellular agriculture affect the livelihoods of the households who currently depend on raising animals? The optimism around cellular agriculture as a tool to reduce humanity’s environmental impact and the complex issues these technologies surface present a need to examine and better understand cellular agriculture’s potential role in transitions to sustainable food systems. This chapter will provide a preliminary review of the current evidence on how cellular agriculture may be utilized to promote a broad sustainable development agenda. We employ the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a lens and use the scientific literature to answer the following research question: how might the widespread adoption of cellular agriculture affect progress toward achieving the SDGs? This chapter begins with a high-level introduction to the SDGs, discussing their relevance to sustainable diets and alternative proteins. It then discusses cellular agriculture, focusing on two specific set of techniques with strong genomic elements: (1) the use of cell cultures and (2) advanced fermentation, both of which are proposed to grow proteins analogous to what livestock currently produces. The following section explores the potential of both cell culture and advanced fermentation to advancing the SDGs. In the final section, we present a brief research and policy agenda geared at helping enable a successful transition toward more sustainable diets.  Background literature: The sustainable development goals, sustainable diets, and the potential of alternative protein Humanity has exceeded what is sometimes referred to as a “planetary boundary,” particularly in terms of climate change, biodiversity loss, disruptions to nutrient cycles, and land systems change (Rockstrom et al., 2009 ). The emerging field of planetary health (Myers, 2017 ) argues that global society has exceeded its safe operating space (Rockstrom et al., 2009 ; Steffen et al., 2015 ) and that the social and economic systems that have evolved since the Industrial Revolution are eroding the ecosystems on which we all depend for life. There is widespread consensus that we must remake these systems if they are to become environmentally sustainable. At the same time, addressing poverty and inequality is equally urgent priority. Action is needed at all levels of government, from local to global, to address these concurrent socioeconomic and environmental imperatives (Biermann et al., 2012 ; Steffen et al., 2015 ). In 2015, the United Nations established the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” In 2016, this agenda was linked with 17 “Sustainable Development Goals” (SDGs), designed to create a framework for monitoring progress and exploring unintended trade-offs. While not legally binding, UN member nations agreed to adopt the 2030 Agenda and to develop policies designed to advance the SDGs, as well as to regularly report on their progress toward achieving their targets. Together, the SDGs elaborate a wide range of social, economic, and environmental objectives. Critically, each goal is paired with specific indicators and quantifiable targets. Many of the SDGs directly or indirectly relate to food systems. Agriculture and food production are among the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, most notably methane and nitrous oxide (Willett et al., 2019 ), and a leading driver of anthropogenic climate change. Agriculture is the primary cause of land systems change, biodiversity loss, and the destruction of natural habitat. The sector is also the largest consumer of freshwater resources, while also being a major source of water contamination. Consequently, anything that may change farming practices is likely to have a direct impact on the SDGs for clean water and sanitation, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water, and life on land. Despite the clear need to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture, it is imperative to also increase food production to feed a growing global population and to achieve the goal of zero hunger, as well as to advance SDGs relating to nutrition and health. Ensuring that high-quality food is both affordable and universally accessible is a necessary step toward addressing inequality and reducing poverty, as well as supporting maternal health and childhood development. However, any policies, technologies, or programs that affect the food system will likely have far-reaching impacts, including possible unintended consequences for people involved in all areas of the food system. It is important to note that many of the world’s poorest people are small-scale farmers, and the poorest small-scale farmers typically are female-headed households. Considering the food system holistically is important to ensuring environmental sustainability, achieving zero hunger, reducing poverty and inequality, and advancing gender equality. At the same time as debates over the SDGs were taking place, another group of scholars were casting a critical eye on the food system (Fraser et al., 2016 ). Over the past 20 years, a consensus has emerged that many of the world’s most pressing social and economic issues intersect with the systems we all depend on for sustenance. Five of the key publications in this regard include a United Nations report entitled “Livestock’s Long Shadow” that explores animal agriculture’s impact on the environment (Steinfeld et al., 2006 ), two special issues that explore a wide range of issues and show how food systems and human systems intersect in scholarly journals Science  (Godfray et al., 2010 ) and The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society  (Godfray and Garnett, 2014 ), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s special report on Climate Change and Land  (Shukla et al., 2019 ), and the “Eat-Lancet Report” (Willett et al., 2019 ) that proposes the components of a nutritionally balanced diet that can be produced sustainably. While providing a thorough review of this large and ambitious body of literature is beyond the scope of the current chapter, at least two high-level conclusions emerge from this outpouring of scholarship. The first is that one of the most effective ways individual consumers can reduce their direct impact on the planet is through dietary choices, specifically by focusing their buying habits on consuming only products that can be produced with a minimal environmental footprint. A second high-level conclusion is that, in general, reducing livestock consumption and eating a diet high in plant matter should provide a net sustainability benefit. This is because producing livestock requires a quantity of resources disproportionate to either its nutritional or caloric contribution to the global food system. Despite disproportionate public messaging and media attention surrounding the environmental impacts of consumer choices, simply exhorting people to eat less meat is no substitute for good policy. This focus on individual dietary decision-making shifts the locus of responsibility away from government and onto consumers (Clapp and Cohen, 2009 ). Similarly, equating livestock consumption with negative environmental outcomes has caused many to point out that there are ways to increase the overall sustainability of livestock-based food systems (Varijakshapanicker et al., 2019 ). There are extremely unsustainable ways of producing fruits and vegetables. Nevertheless, there remains a scientific consensus that diets high in livestock products have a much larger environmental footprint than more plant-based diets and that there would be substantial benefit to the planet if consumers ate less meat and dairy (Eisler et al., 2014 ). It is against a background of this concern over livestock-based diets and general agreement around the need to work toward the SDGs that scholars have begun examining the potential role of alternative protein sources and production techniques in transitioning toward more sustainable food systems (Wu et al., 2014 ). Such work has been accelerated by the extraordinary explosion of innovative consumer products available today. For example, the new generation of meatless burgers is high in protein but without animal products, and the introduction of these products into consumer markets has intersected with the rising discourse around sustainable diets. Activity in this field has accelerated notably over the past decade. Public interest was piqued in 2013 when researchers in the Netherlands successfully used laboratory techniques to craft a “beef” patty from stem cells (Suthar, 2020 ). This initial prototype reputedly costs US$300,000, but costs have plummeted since then. Today, the same type of burger can be produced for about $12 (Mosa, 2019 ). Private and public investment in cellular agriculture has both ballooned, suggesting that a whole new sector of the food economy is currently being developed. Interest in alternative proteins has been amplified by claims over the potential contributions of these products to sustainable food systems. Companies such as GOOD, Perfect Day, Beyond Meat, and Impossible Foods all position their products as more sustainable alternatives to animal products, offering high-quality analogues that have lower environmental footprints yet do not require consumers to sacrifice taste. Most of these companies’ websites explicitly refer to the way their products improve sustainability and some even provide high-level statistics to validate such claims. Impossible Foods’ webpage suggests that “every time you eat impossible burger (instead of beef from a cow),” consumers use 96% less land, consume 87% less water, and produce 89% fewer GHGs (Impossible Foods, 2021 ). However, the livestock industry has started to push back with arguments about the important role animal agriculture plays in pasture management. A nonpeer-reviewed exploration of some of these issues published by the University of Oxford points out that many of these emerging alternative protein systems depend on large industrial supply chains that are extremely capital-intensive (Cusworth, 2021 ). Accordingly, the authors speculate that alternative protein systems may ultimately hurt the prospects of small-scale farmers, suggesting that promoting alternative protein might lead to trade-offs between the SDGs relating to equity and poverty reduction and those that focus on environmental health and ecosystem services. Production methods for alternative proteins are rapidly evolving, particularly the novel methods and technologies associated with cellular agriculture. As the field is changing rapidly, there is a dearth of rigorous peer-reviewed studies through which to explore these issues. This chapter contributes to this emerging field and to the academic debate around alternative proteins by describing the methods and technologies associated with a new approach to protein production (i.e., cellular agriculture), evaluating the conditions under which cellular agriculture may lead to progress toward the SDGs, and identifying where it may result in trade-offs.  Key technologies in cellular agriculture To the layperson, the broad area of alternative proteins must seem bewildering and complex. As an emerging industry, it is difficult to even find a common vernacular through which to describe the different protein production methods and technologies. Test tube burgers, fake meat, clean meat, in vitro meat, animal analogues, plant-based protein, alternative protein, cowless dairy, cruelty-free animal products, and cellular agriculture all compete for space in both public and academic discourses. Each of these terms has strengths and weaknesses, as well as proponents who prefer and lobby for their usage. The vocabulary associated with the emerging technologies of alternative protein is also politically charged, and recently, established industry players have taken to the courts to ensure words like “milk,” “dairy,” or even “mayonnaise” are only used to refer to goods produced through animal agriculture. Reviewing the intricacies of these discussions is beyond the scope of this current chapter. Instead, we adopt a relatively simple nomenclature designed to be as politically neutral as possible, using “animal-derived protein” and “plant-derived protein” to refer to the main two avenues through which people obtain protein in their diets. The focus of this chapter is on two related, but distinct, technologies that are together generally considered to be “cellular agriculture.” The cellular agriculture system we will investigate occurs when cell cultures are grown on some sort of scaffolding in a bioreactor to create a product analogous to that produced by animal muscle tissue. We will call this approach “cell culture-derived protein.” Second, we also explore processes and technologies where proteins analogous to those created by animals are produced through advanced fermentation process that use genetically engineered yeasts or other microorganisms. We will refer to this suite of methods and technologies as “fermentation-derived protein.” Cell culture-derived protein In essence, cellular agriculture processes begin with harvesting a biopsy of tissue cells from a living animal. Ideally, this would be done under an anesthetic in order to mitigate animal welfare concerns. The next step is to select the stem cells from the tissue sample and then these stem cells are grown in bioreactors where the cells consume an oxygen-rich mixture that includes the basic building blocks of life such as amino acids, glucoses, and growth factors. Sometimes, these cells are also grown on three-dimensional “scaffolds” to give them textures and structures similar to conventional meats. In other systems, products are created through growing cells as thread-like strands that can be braided together with fat and other ingredients. For instance, the first cell-derived burger ever consumed was made up of thousands of individually grown muscle strands that were mixed with a range of other ingredients and seasonings. Cellular agriculture continues to build on advances made in genomics and synthetic biology. Genomics research in particular can contribute new methods for targeted genetic approaches for cell selection and proliferation for traditional livestock species. Currently, cellular agriculture selects stem cells from tissue biopsy; however, these cells can only replicate themselves a finite number of times. Emerging research could address this issue by developing targeted genetics techniques for selecting cells (such as induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells) that can replicate themselves indefinitely in vitro, while still being able to differentiate themselves into the types of meat tissues that are commonly consumed today (Post et al., 2020 ). Researchers have accomplished this with some success, in growing skeletal muscle from induced pluripotent stem cells from pigs (e.g., Genovese et al., 2017 ). Such research might ultimately allow for the extended, large-scale replication of cells at high densities, a key requirement for the industrial production of cell culture-derived meat products. These advancements in genomics and livestock cell biology, broadly, can also be applied to other types of cells and tissues required for cellular agriculture production, such as fat (Yuen Jr. et al., 2022 ). Other roles for genomics, and broadly the omics disciplines (e.g., genomics and proteomics), include ways of optimizing cell selection, growth media creation, and bioreactor design for scaled-up cellular agriculture production. Experts recommend increased use and analysis of large omics datasets to achieve such optimization, alongside the creation of “genome-scale metabolic models.” These datasets and models that relate metabolic genes to metabolic pathways for specific livestock would enable greater control and prediction over cell growth pathways (Suthers and Maranas, 2020 ). While there have been huge breakthroughs since the original cell-derived hamburger was consumed in 2013, major barriers still exist. First, the growth serum that feeds the multiplying stem cells in the bioreactors is extremely expensive to produce. Traditionally, this growth serum is derived from bovine embryos, a process that is difficult to scale and presents significant ethical issues and animal welfare concerns. As such, numerous companies and research laboratories are attempting to mass-produce plant-derived serum, and the literature seems optimistic that the industry will clear this hurdle in the relatively near future (Selby, 2020 ). Nevertheless, securing an affordable supply of plant-based serum currently remains a major obstacle. A second barrier relates to the three-dimensional structure of most animal-derived protein products (Stephens et al., 2018 ; Campuzano and Pelling, 2019 ). The cell culture-derived proteins created in bioreactors have none of the form or texture consumers expect in meat. Considerable research is being invested into developing technologies to mold the products of cell culture-derived proteins, including potentially using 3D printing technologies to shape these proteins or developing three-dimensional scaffolds to provide a structure on which cell cultures can grow. Research in the medical sciences, such as innovations in tissue scaffolding (Tijore et al., 2018 ), offers promising avenues for overcoming these obstacles. A third major barrier relates to the types of products that can be manufactured through cellular agriculture. Some proteins are easier to manufacture than others, and certain cellular agriculture products are thus easier to produce at scale and commercialize than others. There are currently challenges that need to be overcome to produce cell culture-derived fats (Fish et al., 2020 ), thereby limiting the potential for developing animal analogues that provide equivalent food experiences as the “original.” These three barriers, combined with the challenge of obtaining regulatory approval for novel consumer products, have led to only a handful of cell culture-derived proteins being available in consumer markets. The products that do exist tend to be hybrid products; for instance, the company JUST received regulatory approval in 2022 to market a synthetic chicken nugget product in Singapore, which consists of a mixture of cellular-derived protein and plant material (Carrington, 2020 ).  Fermentation-derived protein Another approach to manufacturing cellular agriculture products involves the use of microorganisms such as yeast to create proteins through fermentation processes (Stephens et al., 2018 ). Using fermentation to produce protein is a well-established method, being a common technique for synthesizing insulin for diabetics. When insulin was discovered in the early 20th century, most insulin used by diabetics was initially harvested from dogs. Not only did this cause significant animal welfare concerns, but it also created challenges related to maintaining consistent quality and a dependable supply. These problems were overcome in the 1980s when scientists were able to bioengineer microorganisms to produce insulin. Not only did synthetic insulin provide a huge boon in terms of animal welfare, but it also causes fewer allergies and provides much greater volume and consistency of supply. Advanced fermentation has also been used in food production, prior to the emergence of cellular agriculture. In 1990, the US FDA approved the use of rennet, an enzyme that makes milk separate into curds and whey, produced through advanced fermentation. Prior to 1990, rennet was harvested from the stomach lining of ruminant mammals. Today, most of the world’s rennet comes from advanced fermentation processes using bioengineered yeast, providing the world’s primary source of rennet for cheesemaking. Since the breakthroughs involving insulin and rennet in the 1980s and 1990s, the technologies associated with fermentation-derived proteins have evolved rapidly and are now starting to be seen in the marketplace. For instance, Californian start-up company Perfect Day has developed a yeast variety that is able to produce whey protein with long shelf life and is free from hormones, antibiotics, and even lactose (Khan, 2019 ). Starting in 2020, the company received US FDA approval for these proteins, and there are now commercially available ice creams on the US market that entirely use fermentation-derived whey protein. Fermentation techniques for cellular agriculture utilize genomics research and knowledge to develop highly efficient and precise production of microorganisms, as well as specified ingredients of interest. Fermentation relies upon microorganisms, which act either as a primary protein ingredient (i.e., biomass fermentation) or as “cell factories” to produce specific functional ingredients (i.e., precision fermentation). Genomic data is invaluable across emerging fermentation techniques, allowing scientists to target specific molecules they want to produce en masse  and screen for microbial strains for optimal growth of those targeted molecules. For precision fermentation, the introduction of recombinant DNA into microorganisms such as yeast, algae, fungi, or bacteria enables the production of targeted molecules (Stephens et al., 2018 ). Targeted gene editing and the use of big data to screen for suitable molecules and microbial strains are crucial to advance these precision fermentation tools and techniques (Specht, 2022 ). Much like cell culture-derived protein, fermentation-derived protein faces significant technical, consumer, and regulatory challenges. For instance, while companies such as Perfect Day can produce whey protein and fermentation tanks, about 80% of the proteins in cow’s milk is casein, a major ingredient in cheese production. To date, a commercially viable casein production has yet to be developed, but the nonprofit research project called Real Vegan Cheese  claims they are working on this issue and several companies include New Culture  are researching casein production. Other obstacles to fermentation-derived cellular agriculture include obtaining regulatory approval to market products as “dairy,” conflicts with the dairy industry, and consumer concerns over bioengineering. Such obstacles must be overcome if this approach to protein development is to become mainstream. We summarize the key technologies supporting cell culture- and fermentation-derived proteins and outline some of the technological challenges currently being addressed in Table 1.1  . Processes for cell culture- and fermentation-derived protein production are summarized and outlined in Fig. 1.1  . We adapted and simplified Kadim et al. (2015)  flow process for cell culture. Further, we drew from Perfect Day’s (2021)  process diagram to outline precision fermentation processes. Note that these are highly simplified process diagrams, and a comprehensive detailing of the technical components of these processes is beyond the scope of this chapter.   Cellular agriculture and the sustainable development goals To explore how cellular agriculture may be used as a tool for supporting the SDGs, we begin with a framework proposed by Queenan et al. (2017)  who divide the SDGs into four broad impact categories: (1) those that address human well-being; (2) those that focus on environment protection; (3) those that focus on infrastructure and the built environment; and (4) a category they term “one health” that refers to food systems assessed in their entirety. Although all four categories relate to food systems, the first and second are particularly relevant to cellular agriculture and its potential role in food system sustainability. To maintain a reasonable scope, this review focuses on the SDGs that address (1) human well-being and (2) environmental protection. We also add a third impact category—animal welfare—that is not explicitly included in the SDGs but has been proposed by numerous authors (e.g., Garnett et al., 2013 ) as a key dimension of a sustainable food system. Of course, there are tremendous overlaps in terms of the hoped-for impacts of the SDGs across all three of these dimensions; hence, the framework adopted here simply represents a preliminary heuristic for reflecting on the broad sustainability potential of cellular agriculture. Human well-being and cellular agriculture SDGs that relate to human well-being include ending hunger and poverty, promoting good health and well-being, ensuring quality education and gender equality, reducing inequalities, promoting peace justice, and strong institutions (i.e., SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 16). In terms of ending poverty, ensuring good education, promoting strong institutions, or reducing inequality, it is unlikely that advancements in cellular agriculture alone (or any agricultural technology) will play a meaningful role as these are fundamentally social and economic issues rooted in systems of power and politics. Cellular agriculture may have a role to play in making progress toward the SDG for ending world hunger. Today, the United Nations estimates that there are 82 g of proteins available per capita on the planet. According to Walpole et al. (2012) , the average human being weighed 62 kg (using 2005 estimates), and based on general dietary recommendations, people should consume between 0.8 and 1 g of proteins per kilogram of body weight. This suggests that the world already produces ~ 30%–60% more proteins than is currently needed per capita (although this production is highly unevenly distributed across the globe). However, the world population is expected to grow by 30%–40% by 2100 (Roser et al., 2019 ), suggesting that there will be a commensurate increase in demand for protein. To avoid further expansion of animal agriculture and associated degradation of habitat, humanity must both find better ways of distributing and utilizing existing proteins and find much more intensive systems for protein production. This supports the argument that the world needs new forms of protein that can be produced without taking up additional land. In terms of the third SDG related to good health and well-being, cellular agricultural products are sometimes claimed by the literature as offering people healthier dietary choices and safer food products. But for each of these claims, there are vigorous counterclaims, and finding a consensus in the literature is challenging due to two factors. First, there is very little in the way of formal evidence or peer-reviewed research on this topic. Second, most of the claims and counterclaims seem to be made by people with ties to either the cellular agriculture or the livestock industries. There are, however, a small number of scholarly surveys on some of these topics. For instance, Chriki and Hocquette (2020)  provide an early critical review of the extent to which cellular agriculture may provide healthier and safer protein. In this review, these authors note that because cellular-derived protein is produced in a fully controlled environment, biosafety and biosecurity concerns should be easier to address than in traditional abattoir settings where food can encounter pathogens such as Escherichia coli , Campylobacter , and Salmonella . Another potential for cellular agriculture to promote healthy or safe food pertains to antibiotic resistance. Today, the majority of the world’s antibiotics are used in animal agriculture, which has contributed to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. While it is possible that cellular agriculture will utilize some antibiotics to stop contamination in bioreactors, at this juncture, it seems unlikely that cellular agriculture would ever use the volume of antibiotics currently deployed in animal agriculture. Rubio et al. (2020)  also provide an academic review of the potential for cellular agriculture to address public health concerns. They point out that the overconsumption of meat drives several very serious public health issues linked with fat and cholesterol that contribute to heart disease. This leads these authors to point out that if cellular agriculture presents consumers with options that are higher in dietary fiber and lower in saturated fat, then there may be public health benefits linked with a transition to cell-based protein systems. However, cellular agriculture products could follow the global trends of aggressively marketed high fat, salt, and sugar foods and beverages (World Health Organization, 2013 ) by providing products that serve as the basis for low-nutrition, heavily processed foods, marketable due to low cost and gratifying tastes. Currently available alternative protein products are higher in sodium than traditional livestock products. Discussions over the health impacts of different protein supplies inevitably lead to questions around the nutritional quality of these different proteins (Neacsu et al., 2017 ). Much of the literature exploring this issue focuses on the digestibility and the amino acid profile in various protein sources. Overall, traditional livestock (and especially beef) has extremely good digestibility and amino acid profiles, whereas alternative sources of protein including plant-based and cellular agriculture need to be blended to provide the same overall nutritional package. In this regard, the literature also shows that different processing techniques can improve the digestibility of alternative proteins so that they match that of traditional livestock (Joshi and Kumar, 2015 ). Nevertheless, this raises questions of “naturalness” as processing food is problematic in the minds of many consumers (Siegrist, 2008 ; Frewer et al., 2011 ). Overall, the literature on the potential human health impacts of cellular agriculture for consumers is difficult to parse. Partly, the challenge is that these competing health and nutritional claims inevitably privilege incommensurate issues such as food safety versus sodium versus protein digestibility and amino acids. Partly, the challenge is that the technologies associated with cellular agriculture have not yet been deployed at an industrial scale and have not yet been subjected to rigorous testing. Hence, many of the arguments currently expressed in the literature seem conjectural. Overall, this lack of clarity leads Rubio et al. (2020)  to conclude that “… comprehensive, baseline nutritional data for cell-based meat is not [yet] publicly available” (p. 5). Regardless of how the industry looks today, it seems likely that over time, the nutritional quality of cell-derived products could rise to address these issues, but that this may require strong regulatory and policy frameworks to ensure that cell-derived proteins do not evolve to become the next generation’s “junk food.” Another major dimension to consider in terms of the potential impact that cellular agriculture may have on the SDGs relates to the economic costs and opportunities of the emerging technologies and techniques. Generally speaking, publications on this topic are not peer-reviewed and focus on the opportunities new markets afford. For instance, the Boston Consulting Group (Witte et al., 2021 ) anticipates that by 2035, between 11% and 22% of the “meat” eaten on the planet will come from alternative sources. BCG expects that plant-derived, advanced fermentation-derived, and cell culture-derived sources will fill this market. Furthermore, BCG estimates that simply developing the capacity to extrude plant-based proteins into a form palatable to consumers will require between $11 and $28 billions of investment. Overall, BCG estimates that alternative proteins could become a $290 billion industry by 2035. When framed in this way, the development of alternative proteins is presented as an unambiguously wonderful opportunity. But, it is also important to realize that the growth of these new markets may come at a cost to individuals, families, and communities who currently depend on producing animal-derived proteins. Today, the global meat industry is valued at over $1 trillion per annum (Dent, 2020 ). While much of this is captured by large firms (such as the world’s largest meat processor JBS that recently posts ~$50B in annual revenues) (SEC, 2021 ), producing livestock is also a vital livelihood strategy for poor farmers. A United Nations’ “International Fund for Agricultural Development” 2020 report on the livestock sector argues that development agencies should promote animal agriculture specifically among small-scale farmers as an effective way of promoting the SDGs (Rota and Urbani, 2021 ). Livestock are an extremely important livelihood assets for rural households and crucial to reducing poverty (Upton, 2004 ). Livestock agriculture is a source of income for rural households with limited access to markets, as well as a vital source of high-quality dietary protein. This is especially important in areas with undernutrition, protein deficiencies, and gaps in terms of micronutrient availability, especially for young children, where lack of access to high-quality diets can lead to a lifetime of cognitive impairment. The international development literature also promotes the importance of livestock for environmental reasons, especially in areas with poor-quality soils. In such a context, livestock manure provides an invaluable source of plant nutrients and organic matter. As such, there is a consensus in the development literature that livestock agriculture can be an effective strategy in some parts of the world for improving livelihoods (Swanepoel et al., 2010 ). As a result, it is important not to assume that promoting alternative proteins and investing in the technologies associated with plant-, cell culture-, or fermentation-derived proteins will necessarily support SDGs in all contexts. There are situations in which animal agriculture will remain a vital component of sustainable food systems and compatible with the SDGs.  Protecting the natural environment and cellular agriculture The SDGs most directly related to environmental protection include clean water and sanitation, climate action, life below water, and life on land (i.e., SDGs 6, 13, 14, and 15). Cellular agriculture directly relates to all these goals. Indeed, much of the marketing and branding of the current generation of alternative agricultural products such as Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, and Wildtype focus on the environmental benefits their products imply. For instance, the company Impossible Foods claims that their burgers, which use a mixture of cellular- and plant-derived products, generate 90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions and “significantly less water, land, and energy” than an average US beef patty. Similarly, Wildtype, which produces cellular-derived salmon and opened a tasting facility in San Francisco in 2021, claims that their products will lead to both healthier food and healthier oceans because they “produce enclosed, animal-free systems designed to keep fish in the water and out of farms” (Wildtype, 2021 ). The literature on the potential impact of cellular-based technologies to provide environmental benefits is still preliminary but more developed than the literature exploring the potential impact of this technology on human health and well-being. For instance, there are a few life cycle assessments for plant-based beef products that conclude environmental indicators such as nutrient runoff leading to groundwater eutrophication, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions all perform better for alternative protein supplies than traditional livestock (see Mattick et al., 2015 ; Smetana et al., 2015 ). Rubio et al. (2020)  point out that mycoprotein (e.g., fungus-derived products such as Quorn) may result in more energy and GHG emissions than cellular- or plant-derived products; however, they also note that these require less land than plant-based sources and the water footprint for plant-derived proteins is extremely dependent on the agricultural system that produces the protein in the first place. Rubio and colleagues conclude that once optimized, cell-derived proteins are expected to require significantly fewer resources than animal-based proteins. However, a 2015 life cycle assessment of cellular-based proteins presents a different conclusion by suggesting that while cellular-derived proteins require less agricultural land, they may need more energy than traditional livestock as biological processes are replaced with industrial ones (Mattick et al., 2015 ). Chriki and Hocquette (2020)  note that many of the GHG emissions associated with cattle farming involve methane and, although methane has a higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide, it is a much shorter-lived gas that only stays in the atmosphere for a handful of years. By contrast, carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for centuries. Hence, if the widespread adoption of cellular agriculture results in increased carbon dioxide emissions but decreased methane emissions, then there may be a short-term benefit in terms of global warming but some unanticipated longer-term consequences. However, even this point is difficult to resolve as understanding the true impact of cell agriculture is also contingent on where the energy to run the cellular agricultural bioreactors comes from. For instance, bioreactors that obtain green energy from renewable sources or are designed to use waste heat from other industrial products will result in reduced carbon footprints. Overall, the following high-level results seem to stand out from what limited scientific literature exists in terms of the potential for cellular-derived proteins to drive change toward the environmental-facing SDGs. First, finding alternative sources of protein that are not linked with either terrestrial or marine ecosystems should reduce pressure on the Earth’s biosphere and protect wildlife. Second, cellular agricultural products can likely be produced with less nutrient runoff and water pollution than conventional livestock. Third, cellular agricultural operations that utilize renewable energy and/or waste heat to operate should result in a net reduction in GHG emissions, although the level of reduction will be contingent on the type of livestock systems they replace and the specific cellular agricultural systems being deployed.  Animal welfare and cellular agriculture As noted above, the Sustainable Development Goals do not explicitly reference animal welfare and this omission has generated commentary and research by several scholars, such as Olmos Antillón et al. (2021)  and Keeling et al. (2019) , who point out that ensuring domesticated animals are treated ethically is an important goal and entirely consistent with the ambitions of the SDGs. For instance, although Garnett et al.’s (2013)  seminal paper on sustainable intensification predates the SDGs, it explicitly includes animal welfare as a key dimension of a sustainable food system (also see Keeling, 2005 ). Discussions around animal welfare are germane to this review because another major claim made by the cellular agriculture industry is that their products can be produced in a “cruelty-free” fashion. In many regards, this is one of the easiest claims made about cellular agriculture to validate as both the direct and indirect effects of cellular agriculture on animal welfare are far smaller than in the animal-based protein industries. With that said, there are still a handful of complexities that warrant being unpacked. First, since alternative protein products may utilize plant-based ingredients, there will be habitat-related problems caused by farming practices (however, given that the livestock industry uses huge amounts of grain for feed, this problem exists in both animal agriculture and alternative protein systems). Second, cell culture-derived proteins currently use donor animals to acquire stem cells and many current cellular-based companies use growth mediums and serums derived from animal products (Chriki and Hocquette, 2020 ). With that said, today, animal agriculture affects many billion animals each year so while current cellular agricultural practices and technologies still utilize some animal components, the level of impact is minuscule compared to conventional animal agriculture. Furthermore, numerous companies and research laboratories are investigating alternatives to using animal-derived serums for propagating cell cultures (Selby, 2020 ), and this technological hurdle is expected to be overcome in the relatively near future. In summary, the claims that cellular-based protein systems will result in significantly less animal welfare issues than conventional livestock seem both clear-cut and intuitive.   Conclusion: A brief policy and research agenda The world faces an imperative sustainability transition, and technology is poised to play an important role. In particular, it seems quite likely that one of the most important aspects of this technological transition will be experienced through the protein sector, where a range of novel technologies, including our ability to harness microorganisms and cell cultures to replace livestock products, will feature prominently. This chapter has surfaced both the potential for this technology to support SDGs and the complexity of achieving these desired outcomes. From this review, we would like to conclude with three high-level points:1. The emerging technologies and techniques in harnessing microorganisms and cell cultures to generate proteins appear to have great potential for reducing the environmental footprint of our food system, thereby helping promote the Sustainable Development Goals; however, the literature is too nascent and preliminary to be able to conclude definitively how this might unfold.  2. While there are tremendous economic opportunities to establish new enterprises in the broad area of alternative proteins, there are also economic costs associated with this transition that should be managed.  3. There is a significant role for regulation and policymaking to help ensure the technologies associated with alternative proteins generate widespread environmental and social benefits.    Based on these three conclusions, we briefly propose a policy and research agenda for cellular agriculture. A number of technical challenges that need to be researched and addressed before cellular agriculture products will be able to be produced at scale and compete in the marketplace. Such challenges include developing affordable plant-based growth serum, better tools to allow alternative proteins to take on a three-dimensional shape, and an enhanced understanding of the genomics of microorganisms in support of advanced fermentation. The insights from diverse omics fields are increasingly being applied to advance knowledge supporting the commercial-scale potential for cellular agriculture (Ontario Genomics, 2021 ). Further research in and application of genomics datasets, models, and editing techniques to reprogram or design novel livestock biological systems entirely can contribute to scaling various fermentation and cultivated meat inputs and techniques. Rigorous research on the environmental impact of different emerging technologies and production systems is also needed. To ensure that the protein revolution indeed reduces the environmental impact of our food systems, thorough and detailed life cycle assessments of the environmental impacts of cellular agriculture at different stages of the production cycle are required. Furthermore, these assessments must be linked directly to policymaking such that governments incentivize specific tools and techniques that allow proteins to be produced with minimal environmental costs. It will be necessary to both understand and help ameliorate the costs of the transition to alternative proteins in the conventional livestock sector. If alternative proteins reach their potential over the next decade, then they will seriously erode the contribution the livestock sector makes to the economy. While this will ultimately create net benefits in terms of environmental health and food system sustainability, the transition risks undermining a sector of the economy on which hundreds of millions of people currently depend. Helping livestock-dependent communities and families through this transition becomes a policy challenge of the utmost importance, which will involve government support, training and retraining programs, and major investments in rural communities all over the world. Reviewing this suite of policy tools is beyond the scope of the current chapter, but it is likely that valuable lessons could be learned from other sectors of the economy that have undergone massive technological disruption such as mining, forestry, and fisheries where a combination of novel technologies and new consumer demands have disrupted established systems. Finally, if the global protein production system is facing a major period of disruption as suggested by the literature, then the colleges, universities, and training centers focused on animal agriculture all over the world need to radically rethink how they train the next generation. If the future means we depend less on animal-derived protein and more on plant-, cell culture-, or fermentation-derived proteins, then today’s departments of animal bioscience that currently focus most of their energies on topics such as dairy, beef, pork, and poultry management and genomics need to also transition through changing faculty hiring strategies as well as developing new courses and programs of study. To close, we return to the sustainability challenge of feeding the future in a way that does not further degrade the biosphere. There are no easy answers or single solutions, yet it is very clear that current protein systems significantly undermine planetary health. It seems both inevitable and urgent that we develop and embrace new protein systems to reduce our collective impact on the environment. Much of the imperative for change must come from policymakers and consumers, and we are already seeing signs that both policymakers and consumers worldwide are better understanding the importance of the protein transition. In this, emerging new technologies associated with cell cultures and fermentation greatly increase the scope and scale of what we imagine is possible for transitions to equitable and sustainable food systems.
