                  The study focused on the role of mechanical engineers towards achieving sustainable development. Critical reviews of the problems facing the development of technology were discussed as well as the way forward. Based on the challenges of our immediate society, the level of our technology can only be improved when our teaching and curriculum is reviewed. Hence, the study suggested that our approach as mechanical engineers towards research must change from the basic research concept to applied research concept. This would not only improve the academic sector but hasten the rate at which problems are solved by the mechanical engineers in the society, thereby bringing sustainability. More so, failure of engineering component is always attributed to design. This study further suggested on the need to improve the design of engineering systems to improve its sustainability while in service. The impact of the developed product must be felt in terms of green technology.

Introduction      On becoming a contemporary mechanical Engineer: everything changes, everything is connected, engineering and  engineers have never mattered more [1]. Longman dictionary of contemporary define sustainability as the ability to  continue without causing damage to the environment or ability to continue for longer time. Sustainability originated   Author name / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2016) 000â€“000    from the Latin word â€œsustinereâ€� (since â€œsusâ€� mean up and â€œtinereâ€� means to hold). More meaning was provided by  Dictionaries but more relevant to this subject being to â€œendureâ€�, â€œsupportâ€� or â€œmaintainâ€�.  Sustainability is the  capability to be environmentally friendly and not be destructive to the environment. A system with technology that  is reuse continually and keeps it perpetual usefulness is known as sustainable system.  Sustainable development is  that which use the earthâ€™s resources, not destroy the environment and not consume the natural resources. Endurance  capability may be seen as s sustainability. Long term responsibility, management with aspect including economic,  environmental and social with the idea of stewardship and management of resource responsibly is said to  sustainability for humans [2].    However, this paper carried out further review on the key role of mechanical engineers in achieving the sustainable  development goals. This will help the mechanical engineers to change their approach towards research, thereby increase the  sustainability of our manufacturing product.   2. Sustainable Development in Terms of Mechanical Engineering       In March 20, Bruntland [3] submitted a United Nations report titled 'Our Common Future' there the idea of  sustainable development was first highlighted in the Word Commission on Environment and Development.  Sustainable development is a creation that was done to meet the present generations need and as well not querying  the capability of generation to come, in meeting their demand [4]. Sometime this can also be defined as:  "Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of  future generations to meet their own needs". Sustainability therefore, encompass the system of managing ecological  balance by protecting the generation to come by not eroding the natural resources. Definition by Bruntland has  attained universal acceptance and many see this as means of delivering sustainability as a result of current  unmanageable style of society. In 2005, for instance, the Royal Academy of Engineering published principles  guiding sustainable development on energy, which can resolve the challenge that, "we are surpassing the planet  capacity to accommodate our emissions and many of the resources we used, whist most essential need of majority  that occupy the planets cannot be meet. [5].  According to Ehrenfeld, [6] sustainability is the key possibility that will  enhance human life to flourish on the planet forever".         An acceptable universal definition for sustainability is difficult to achieve as it is expected to get many things  done. The earth will be able to support itself if sustainability is achieved.  Earth Charter speaks of on "a sustainable  global society founded on respect of nature, universal human rights, economic justice and a culture of peace". But  generally, the concept of sustainability is built on three pillars as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows the interaction  among the three elements of sustainability: Society, Economy, Environment and all this three element has their  foundation built in mechanical engineering [7].

SD can be defined as "solution to a problem which minimizes negative effects and considers  the environment, people and economy". Therefore, [2]    Economy + Ecology + Society = Sustainability                                                   (1)    This can be interpreted to be economy that is productive, healthy ecology and society that is just for today and  tomorrow.   2.1. What is mechanical engineering and Who is a Mechanical Engineer?       Webster dictionary define mechanical engineering as discipline which make use of applied engineering,  engineering mathematics, physics and materials science principles to design, analyse, manufacture, and maintain  mechanical systems. Mechanical engineering has been ones broadest and oldest within engineering disciplines.  Requirements of mechanical engineering field need knowledge of core areas including thermodynamic, mechanics,  material science, dynamics, structural analysis, modelling and electricity. Furthermore, to these core principles,  mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and  product life cycle management to design and analyse, industrial machinery, weapons, manufacturing plants, aircraft,  industrial equipment, medical devices, robotics, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, watercraft, and  others. This branch of engineering involves design, production, and running of machinery.          American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) described mechanical engineers as the one who create and  develop mechanical systems for all of humankind. The principles of force, energy and motion are being concern,  mechanical engineers use their knowledge of design, manufacture, and operational processes to advance the world  around us, improve safety, ability to manage economic with strength and enjoyment throughout the world.  Mechanical also developed machine and tool that produce product that range from sport equipment to  pharmaceutical devices, medical devices, personal computers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, automobile engines,  robotic arms, electrical power plants and solar driers. Mechanical engineer usually touches all section of life,  spanning industries with limited barriers, opportunities for mechanical engineers to build up their career are  enormous as opportunity are available worldwide throughout many companies ranging from large multinational to  small local companies. [8]     3. Impacts of Mechanical Engineer on Sustainability in Terms of Population, Aggression and Pollution     The impact of mechanical engineer on sustainability is major on the environment and hereby simply divided into  three components: population, aggression and pollution.   3.1. Population       United Nations population estimates and projections, United nation estimated that world population will be about  7.55 billion in 2017, and may surpass 11 billion people by 2100 as shown in Table 1. The world is metamorphosed  radically, and the word population will continue to increase daily as there are more rural area to urban area  migration which demands for adoption of sustainable acts. Requirements for green technology to sustainable energy,  clean air, drinking water, green transportation, safe waste disposal and renewable energy should be considered.     Table 1. Population of the world and regions, 2017, 2030, 2050 and 2100, according to the medium-variant projection    Region                                                                       Unit 2017 2030 2050 2100  World  billion 7550 8551 9772 11184  Africa  billion 1256 1704 2528 4468  Asia  billion 4504 4947 5257 4780  Europe billion 742 739 716 653  Latin America and the Caribbean.  billion 646 718 780 712  Northern America  billion 361 395 435 499  Oceania  billion 41 48 57 72   Author name / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2016) 000â€“000    Source: United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division [9].  World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision. New York: United Nations.    3.2. Aggression      The attitude towards the natural life and biological system shows that human belligerence toward both animals  and plants, for example the issue of wildlife, forests and the extreme rate of over exploring the natural resources  available such as wood, water, petroleum, coals, minerals has affected the possibility of achieving environmental  sustainability [2].  3.3. Pollution        Engineering has driven and steer industrial innovation and improved the prosperity of human. In turn, this has led  to the creation of new and important group of problems to the environment which range from exposure to air  pollution, toxic exposure to water, food, soil, depletion of non-renewable resources (Solid minerals, petroleum,  wood), destruction of ecosystem and global climate brunt. Human effects on the climate incorporate the air  contamination in urban communities, the poisons including dangerous synthetic concoctions like nitrogen oxides,  sulphur oxides, unstable natural mixes and particulate issue that deliver photochemical exhaust cloud and corrosive  rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that debase the ozone layer.        Particulates, for example, sulphate pressurized canned products in the climate lessen the immediate irradiance  and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface, a marvel known as worldwide diminishing, the reduction is evaluated  to have been around 4% in the vicinity of 1960 and 1990. Worldwide darkening may have disorganising the  worldwide water cycle by decreasing, vanishing and precipitation in a few regions and cause cooling effect also [10]        In other to actually achieved sustainability development goals, mechanical engineers need to develop mechanical  systems that will help in harvesting all this natural resource stated in section 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 without having  environmental pollution on the communities.      4. Roles of Mechanical Engineer in Terms of Design and Infrastructure        System design, infrastructure provision and engineering enterprise management, are main concern of mechanical  engineers, as making decision is an act that is performed throughout the life-cycle of the infrastructure, enterprise,  process or product. Mechanical engineers play lots of role of such life circle decision making.

SD can be defined as "solution to a problem which minimizes negative effects and considers  the environment, people and economy". Therefore, [2]    Economy + Ecology + Society = Sustainability                                                   (1)    This can be interpreted to be economy that is productive, healthy ecology and society that is just for today and  tomorrow.   2.1. What is mechanical engineering and Who is a Mechanical Engineer?       Webster dictionary define mechanical engineering as discipline which make use of applied engineering,  engineering mathematics, physics and materials science principles to design, analyse, manufacture, and maintain  mechanical systems. Mechanical engineering has been ones broadest and oldest within engineering disciplines.  Requirements of mechanical engineering field need knowledge of core areas including thermodynamic, mechanics,  material science, dynamics, structural analysis, modelling and electricity. Furthermore, to these core principles,  mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and  product life cycle management to design and analyse, industrial machinery, weapons, manufacturing plants, aircraft,  industrial equipment, medical devices, robotics, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, watercraft, and  others. This branch of engineering involves design, production, and running of machinery.          American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) described mechanical engineers as the one who create and  develop mechanical systems for all of humankind. The principles of force, energy and motion are being concern,  mechanical engineers use their knowledge of design, manufacture, and operational processes to advance the world  around us, improve safety, ability to manage economic with strength and enjoyment throughout the world.  Mechanical also developed machine and tool that produce product that range from sport equipment to  pharmaceutical devices, medical devices, personal computers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, automobile engines,  robotic arms, electrical power plants and solar driers. Mechanical engineer usually touches all section of life,  spanning industries with limited barriers, opportunities for mechanical engineers to build up their career are  enormous as opportunity are available worldwide throughout many companies ranging from large multinational to  small local companies. [8]     3. Impacts of Mechanical Engineer on Sustainability in Terms of Population, Aggression and Pollution     The impact of mechanical engineer on sustainability is major on the environment and hereby simply divided into  three components: population, aggression and pollution.   3.1. Population       United Nations population estimates and projections, United nation estimated that world population will be about  7.55 billion in 2017, and may surpass 11 billion people by 2100 as shown in Table 1. The world is metamorphosed  radically, and the word population will continue to increase daily as there are more rural area to urban area  migration which demands for adoption of sustainable acts. Requirements for green technology to sustainable energy,  clean air, drinking water, green transportation, safe waste disposal and renewable energy should be considered.     Table 1. Population of the world and regions, 2017, 2030, 2050 and 2100, according to the medium-variant projection    Region                                                                       Unit 2017 2030 2050 2100  World  billion 7550 8551 9772 11184  Africa  billion 1256 1704 2528 4468  Asia  billion 4504 4947 5257 4780  Europe billion 742 739 716 653  Latin America and the Caribbean.  billion 646 718 780 712  Northern America  billion 361 395 435 499  Oceania  billion 41 48 57 72   Author name / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2016) 000â€“000    Source: United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division [9].  World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision. New York: United Nations.    3.2. Aggression      The attitude towards the natural life and biological system shows that human belligerence toward both animals  and plants, for example the issue of wildlife, forests and the extreme rate of over exploring the natural resources  available such as wood, water, petroleum, coals, minerals has affected the possibility of achieving environmental  sustainability [2].  3.3. Pollution        Engineering has driven and steer industrial innovation and improved the prosperity of human. In turn, this has led  to the creation of new and important group of problems to the environment which range from exposure to air  pollution, toxic exposure to water, food, soil, depletion of non-renewable resources (Solid minerals, petroleum,  wood), destruction of ecosystem and global climate brunt. Human effects on the climate incorporate the air  contamination in urban communities, the poisons including dangerous synthetic concoctions like nitrogen oxides,  sulphur oxides, unstable natural mixes and particulate issue that deliver photochemical exhaust cloud and corrosive  rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that debase the ozone layer.        Particulates, for example, sulphate pressurized canned products in the climate lessen the immediate irradiance  and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface, a marvel known as worldwide diminishing, the reduction is evaluated  to have been around 4% in the vicinity of 1960 and 1990. Worldwide darkening may have disorganising the  worldwide water cycle by decreasing, vanishing and precipitation in a few regions and cause cooling effect also [10]        In other to actually achieved sustainability development goals, mechanical engineers need to develop mechanical  systems that will help in harvesting all this natural resource stated in section 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 without having  environmental pollution on the communities.      4. Roles of Mechanical Engineer in Terms of Design and Infrastructure        System design, infrastructure provision and engineering enterprise management, are main concern of mechanical  engineers, as making decision is an act that is performed throughout the life-cycle of the infrastructure, enterprise,  process or product. Mechanical engineers play lots of role of such life circle decision making. The one been utilized  in most continent is partitioned into five principle phases, which involve Life Cycle Engineering means to integrate  state of the art technologies into subsequent sustainability and to enable information and statistics flow as shown in  Fig. 3  â�– Frame work requirement, Feasibility Study usually cover this.  â�– Decision scoping, Project Definition Study often capture this.  â�– Preparation and comprehensive design stage  â�– Execution, supply and run  â�– The end of useful life and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO)      Fig. 3: the role of mechanical engineers in design and infrastructure  786 I.P. Okokpujie  et al. / Procedia Manufacturing 35 (2019) 782â€“788  Author name / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2016) 000â€“000         The accompanying segments give direction on how sustainability contemplations and a feasible way to  improvement and deal with designing with impact making decision at each stage [8]. Qualitative and participative  style is suitable for framing and definition of scope decision [9]. While analytic and strategic method is suitable for  planning and design. Furthermore, quantitative and managerial skill where best for execution, supply and running  the product. User and stakeholder preference and desire must be capture at all time throughout the duration of this  process. When the phases of decisions are implemented, supplies, up and running, it has impact on the future  development. It of importance to note that earlier involvement of sustainable development in the process of  execution, delivery and functioning stages benefit from rigorous examine of sustainable development issues. From  there on unforeseen challenges with resource scarcity due to short sightedness might lead to overturning the at risk  sustainable efforts. Engineering decision and execution need to use standard of sustainable development at all stage  [5]    4.1. Requirement framing       Framing the requirements draws in a description of the necessity or coveted results [11].   Advertisers describe this the 'necessities and needs' for new commodity or service, and the surrounding is finished  by portraying the challenges, issue or problems to be handled in its general setting and vital concurring the limits to  the decision making. Regularly, such work and results are attempted and decided through a Feasibility Study be that  as it may, at the opposite end of the size of engineering projects; they may essentially be done in the beginning  periods of a generally consistent outline process.       Progressively, there is likewise a need to acknowledge deliberately what it is adequate to fabricate or make the  customer or client for the engineering design unable to suit a significant jump in design idealization to acknowledge  a full practical improvement approach. This approach from a sensible point of view should be incorporated into the  plan [12].  4.2. Decision scoping      In this phase, important effort will be vital to conclude on cautiously constructed characterization of the  challenge(s) to rectified the problem(s) encountered, therefore to decide on the goals, purposes and aspiration for the  project in order to developed the engineering decisions. These results are accomplished through an established  project descriptive research or plainly outcome derived from the earlier phases of the smoothly continuous design  proceeding previously hint at.     It is pivotal to the effective conveyance of sustainable development to understand that this is the phase where  thorough thought of sustainable development challenges, and specifically a support to severe approach will create  the best advantage. The more outline choices are derived at this phase without thought of sustainable development,  the less sustainability development can be achieved.    4.3. preparation and comprehensive Design       Preparation can effectively be grouped as an analytical process that introduces the action that will be taken,  which involves an assessment of the alternative accessible, developing the aims and goals that would display a  favourable outcome and a method of attaining them. Comprehensive design at that stage involves the creating of  results, component or process preparation, or groundwork preparation that attains the entire numerous yet associated  prerequisites, wellness for reason, security, quality, esteem for cash, aesthetics, constructability, and usability and  material proficiency. It is accomplished that alongside the reduction of the antagonistic socio-environmental  impacts, the augmentation of the surroundings where attainable, and the improvement of quality of life for end  users, workers and nearby resident alike. This is a substantial threat for engineering designers yet one that can with  cautious idea, imagination, advancement and persistence be conveyed for societal advantage. Despite the fact that  there is a different phase of 'End of usable life' to think of, is indispensable that, at this Preparation and Design  phase, dynamic thought of these challenges is incorporated. A major instance of such attention is the significance of  design for dismantling, to consider the utmost reuse and recycling of the resources installed in the infrastructure or  end result or goods created.  4.4. Execution, Distribution and Service       Execution, distribution and service involve the critical recognition of the designs, for instance, a genuine product,  development of advanced foundation or application of a recent method or practice in chemical engineering. It bears   Author name / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2016) 000â€“000    rehashing that it is vital to perceive that prior practical methodologies are to a highly powerless at this phase to being  toppled through foolhardy reactions used in unanticipated troubles and resource requirements, e.g., the cost  lessening measures taking on the appearance as â€˜value engineeringâ€™. The fundamentals of sustainable development  as a result, have to be adapted in all levels in an engineering resolution reached and also in its applications.   4.5. The End of Useful Life      All devised and concoct commodity or goods created, methods, framework and groundwork would always  resolve to a designed and truly existing design life, after which sustainability and a sustainable advancement or  feasible development approaches a request proceeded with use of the reasoning which is of now examined. The  revolution of resources for additionally utilizes, or for re-retention into the earth, through recycled, reusing or  disposition, is an essential component of sustainable development, for which the term 'rumination' has been  proposed or recommended [13].       The waste order must be practiced or adaptive: Firstly, anticipate events that may call for reuse or recycling; If  that isn't attainable, at that point create a realistic or useful chance in recycling; If after maximising useful recycling  should disposition be deliberated upon; After that, a rehabilitation of the energy incorporated into the material to be  discarded of should be desired, with discard to landfill being deliberated upon as the final option, not the initial  option as is often the scenario at hand.    5. Conclusion      The engineers need to be very conscious about the growing environment amid the consumers and overall law of a  government or constitution, within reach is a huge burden and tension on inventors as well as engineers in working,  in achieving sustainable developments. The development here is defined in terms of industrialization, is  fundamental, essential, necessary and imperative for the social-economic advancement of any communities.  Antithetical to environmentalist, sustainability is an approach or notion which takes into consideration the socio- physical, public and, the fiscal or monitory targets and as an alternative, the measurement of a community or  association.       In conclusion, to achieve a global transformation on our economy through sustainable development, we have to  promote our current policies and channel our vision into the vision of the United Nation agenda for sustainable  development. Aside that, young minds in mechanical engineering should be trained in anticipating the sustainability  problems oppugn at contributing to a global sustainable development.     Recommendation       Higher institutes of learning should consequently develop new perspectives in teaching mechanical engineers the  required knowledge in achieving sustainable development in whatever environment the students is position in future  and must be contingent upon the ability to adapt to threats to sustainability and engaged oneself within the  progression of the world. A debateable and project familiarize with teaching and a good learning foundation or core  should be marked in outline, which present the prospective essentials and important proficiency for inexperienced  and blooming engineers.

Critical reviews of the problems facing the development of technology were discussed as well as the way forward. Based on the challenges of our immediate society, the level of our technology can only be improved when our teaching and curriculum is reviewed. Hence, the study suggested that our approach as mechanical engineers towards research must change from the basic research concept to applied research concept. This would not only improve the academic sector but hasten the rate at which problems are solved by the mechanical engineers in the society, thereby bringing sustainability. More so, failure of engineering component is always attributed to design. This study further suggested on the need to improve the design of engineering systems to improve its sustainability while in service. The impact of the developed product must be felt in terms of green technology.   Keywords Mechanical Engineering  Research  Society  Sustainability    References 1 E.W.
