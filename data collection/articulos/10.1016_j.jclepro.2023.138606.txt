                  With the rapid surge in global population, urbanization, and improved living standards, there has been a significant increase in untreated wet waste. This escalation poses a critical challenge for waste management and raises considerable environmental concerns. One pivotal solution is the conversion of this wet waste into valuable energy resources and carbon-neutral mediums, a strategy aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) - Affordable and Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15) - Life on Land. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and pyrolysis have emerged as effective technologies due to their ability to process large volumes of wet waste and convert it into energy-rich and carbon-stable products with high energy efficiency. This study introduces a novel framework incorporating advanced machine learning techniques (including deep neural networks, random forest, and eXtreme gradient boosting) with dual-objective optimization. This approach enables a comparative analysis of the solid products from HTC and pyrolysis, focusing on their Carbon Stability Index (CSI) and Return on Energy Investment (REI) index. This assessment enables the tailoring of char production towards specific applications, yielding optimal conditions for high energy efficiency and stable carbon sequestration. In a case study involving wet food waste, the analysis indicated a significant enhancement from 4.83 to 14.43 in REI and an increase from 47.4 to 57.98 in CSI compared to conventional HTC solutions. Moreover, the uncertainty analysis demonstrated that our machine learning-based model provides robust and reliable predictions, with most of the R-squared (R2) values exceeding 0.90, meeting or exceeding the R2 values reported in similar ML models of biomass conversion in the literature, reinforcing its potential for practical applications. Our study also plots the solid products in a Van Krevelen diagram, showing composition changes during conversion. These findings exemplify the potential of these processes in bolstering the primary objectives of SDG7 and SDG15, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.

Fig. 5   Fig. 6 Pareto optimal profiles show the REI and CSI trade-offs. This figure displays the Pareto optimal profiles illustrating the trade-off between REI and CSI. The graph displays six solutions for both the HTC (HC1 to HC6) and pyrolysis (BC1 to BC6) processes. Hydrochar is derived from the HTC experimental setting with a 47.30 CSI index and 3.83 REI value (Solution HC), produced under a 250 °C reaction temperature and 60 min residence time. The HTC options HC1 to HC6 provide relatively high REI and low CSI properties compared to options BC1 to BC6. The blue dashed box illustrates the CSI optimal solution, achieved through the pyrolysis method, along with its respective process conditions. The orange dashed box represents the REI optimal solution derived using the HTC method, including its corresponding process conditions. Acronyms: HC (Hydrochar), BC (Biochar), AD (Anaerobic Digestion). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)

Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Cornell University Ithaca NY 14853 USA       Handling Editor: Cecilia Maria Villas Bôas de Almeida With the rapid surge in global population, urbanization, and improved living standards, there has been a significant increase in untreated wet waste. This escalation poses a critical challenge for waste management and raises considerable environmental concerns. One pivotal solution is the conversion of this wet waste into valuable energy resources and carbon-neutral mediums, a strategy aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) - Affordable and Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15) - Life on Land. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and pyrolysis have emerged as effective technologies due to their ability to process large volumes of wet waste and convert it into energy-rich and carbon-stable products with high energy efficiency. This study introduces a novel framework incorporating advanced machine learning techniques (including deep neural networks, random forest, and eXtreme gradient boosting) with dual-objective optimization. This approach enables a comparative analysis of the solid products from HTC and pyrolysis, focusing on their Carbon Stability Index (CSI) and Return on Energy Investment (REI) index. This assessment enables the tailoring of char production towards specific applications, yielding optimal conditions for high energy efficiency and stable carbon sequestration. In a case study involving wet food waste, the analysis indicated a significant enhancement from 4.83 to 14.43 in REI and an increase from 47.4 to 57.98 in CSI compared to conventional HTC solutions. Moreover, the uncertainty analysis demonstrated that our machine learning-based model provides robust and reliable predictions, with most of the R-squared (R2) values exceeding 0.90, meeting or exceeding the R2 values reported in similar ML models of biomass conversion in the literature, reinforcing its potential for practical applications. Our study also plots the solid products in a Van Krevelen diagram, showing composition changes during conversion. These findings exemplify the potential of these processes in bolstering the primary objectives of SDG7 and SDG15, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.

Metropolises generate large amounts of wet waste due to high food and water consumption (Li et al., 2022 ). As one of the most important components of wet organic waste, food waste production is projected to surpass 103 million tons by 2025, posing a significant challenge to solid waste management and organic resource recovery (Liang et al., 2021 ). Additionally, wet wastes are particularly problematic because of their water content and the presence of contaminants, which make them prone to causing environmental issues (Yang et al., 2020 ). Improper handling of these wastes can spread diseases, air, water, and land pollution through insects and microbial contamination (Nandhini et al., 2022 ). Consequently, addressing the treatment of wet waste is an urgent issue. Thermochemical conversion (TCC) methods are a set of techniques used to convert feedstocks into useful energy forms, including heat, electricity, and fuels, and offer promising ways to manage wet waste biomass and replace traditional fossil fuels, thereby contributing to low-carbon and sustainability targets (Demirbas, 2009 ). Notably, two commonly employed techniques within the broader scope of TCC methods are hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and pyrolysis (Sharma et al., 2020 ). HTC is a transformative process that converts biomass into solid, smokeless fuels. This transformation is achieved at moderate temperatures ranging from 180 to 250 °C, under considerable pressure between 2 and 10 Megapascals, and is carried out over a duration of several hours (Kruse et al., 2013 ). On the other hand, pyrolysis involves heating biomass to 300–650 °C without oxygen. It can be categorized into fast pyrolysis, distinguished by rapid heating rates exceeding 10–200 °C per second, brief residence times generally less than 2 s but ranging from 0.5 to 10 s, and operating temperatures between 450 and 650 °C (Kan et al., 2016 ); and slow pyrolysis, characterized by slower heating rates from 0.1 to 2 °C per second, longer residence times ranging from 5 to 120 min, and lower temperatures typically under 500 °C (Brown, 2012 ). Both HTC and pyrolysis are recognized for their ability to produce various products, including biochar, hydrochar, bio-oil, and syngas, each of which has significant potential to advance environmental sustainability (Hussin et al., 2023 ). However, the yields of the products in both pyrolysis and HTC processes are fundamentally determined by specific operational parameters (Tomczyk et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). For instance, at lower temperature ranges, solid products, such as biochar and hydrochar, tend to dominate (Nizamuddin et al., 2017 ; Tomczyk et al., 2020 ). As the operating temperature increases, the sharp decrease in char yield is offset by an upsurge in the production of liquid products at moderate temperatures. When working at the highest temperatures, there is a predilection for the production of light gases (Nizamuddin et al., 2017 ; Tomczyk et al., 2020 ). As reported (Zhang et al., 2009 ), it's noteworthy that an extended residence time typically promotes the formation of gaseous and solid products over liquid ones in both HTC and pyrolysis processes. Furthermore, in the pyrolysis process, a higher heating rate may not be favorable for char product generation, but it does yield a higher heat value of biochar compared to a lower heating rate (Angın, 2013 ). The role of water content in the HTC process is also noteworthy, as water serves as a reaction medium. However, a high biomass water content may not be beneficial to improve the process's energy efficiency because elevating the water to the specified reaction temperature requires substantial heat input (Gao et al., 2020 ). These observations highlight the complex interplay of process conditions affecting the production of solid products in both HTC and pyrolysis. The solid products, particularly biochar and hydrochar, as sustainable energy sources, have immense potential to contribute significantly towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) - Affordable and Clean Energy (Nations, 2015 ). Because of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more critical than ever to decarbonize the energy sector (Çelik et al., 2022 ). The char's enhanced fuel properties, including higher calorific value, improved fuel ratio, and more structured aromatic chains (Anand et al., 2023 ), make them more energy-dense than untreated biomass (Clare et al., 2015 ; Sharma et al., 2020 ). Moreover, their high carbon content, specific surface area, nutrient retention capacity, and stability (Islam et al., 2021 ; Lehmann et al., 2011 ), prove invaluable when applied as soil amendments, making them integral to the sustainable use and conservation of terrestrial ecosystems - a crucial component of SDG15. Research has shown that biochar and hydrochar can enhance the health of soil and vegetation (Brassard et al., 2019 ; Cavali et al., 2023 ), thereby decreasing greenhouse gas emissions originating from farming activities and fostering sustainable practices for land and freshwater ecosystems, another key aspect of SDG15. With the swift advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) techniques, TCC processes can be enhanced by solving complex non-linear problems to optimize process parameters, predict product yield, and provide real-time control (Khan et al., 2023 ). Indeed, the application of ML algorithms in predicting the yields and compositions of TCC products, including bio-oil, biochar, and syngas, has been successfully demonstrated in numerous studies. For instance, bio-oil properties have been forecasted through a random forest (RF) model considering biomass characteristics and pyrolysis conditions (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Similarly, other research projects have adopted decision tree regression and multilayer perceptron-based ML models to predict syngas composition (Elmaz et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, RF and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models have been developed to predict solid biochar product yields from biomass pyrolysis (Pathy et al., 2020 ; Zhu et al., 2019 ). ML algorithms like deep neural networks (DNN) and RF have also been applied to predict biochar properties, specifically adsorption performance (Katongtung et al., 2022 ). In parallel, other researchers have effectively employed the DNN model to predict solid product hydrochar fuel properties and propose the dehydration and decarboxylation degree to evaluate HTC reaction (Mu et al., 2022 ). Despite substantial research on ML in biomass thermal conversion, there remain notable gaps in our understanding, particularly regarding the design, optimization, and evaluation of biomass systems. Current research insufficiently addresses biochar and hydrochar properties as renewable fuels or carbon sequestration agents and lacks a comparative analysis of the energy efficiency of TCC processes. To address these gaps, this study presents an ML-assisted multi-objective optimization framework. The framework employs ML algorithms such as RF, XGBoost, and DNN, which have been trained on a variety of biomass compositions and process parameters to optimize the TCC process conditions. The objective is to effectively transform wet waste into a renewable energy resource and a viable medium for carbon sequestration. The case study specifically focuses on wet food waste, providing a real-world context for applying these advanced ML techniques. The subsequent uncertainty and Van Krevelen diagram analysis elucidate the relationships between process conditions and the resulting product properties, underscoring the utility of ML in optimizing these important processes for sustainable development. Key contributions and novelties of this study are summarized below:• A novel framework integrating machine learning and optimization of process operating conditions (such as temperature and residence time) to conduct a comparative analysis of the solid products from HTC and pyrolysis in support of SDG7 and SDG15.  • Formulated a novel multi-objective optimization problem assessing energy efficiency and carbon sequestration potential in a wet food waste case study. This approach has helped tailor char production to specific applications: high energy-efficient hydrochar under lower temperatures, shorter residence times, and less water, and stable biochar for carbon sequestration and soil amendment under higher temperatures and longer residence times.  • The first work comparatively analyzes biochar and hydrochar using machine learning, multi-objective optimization, uncertainty, and Van Krevelen diagram analysis, which revealed a notable enhancement of up to 377% in REI and a 6% increase in CSI compared to conventional HTC solutions.     2 Materials and methods In the pursuit of a deeper understanding of biochar and hydrochar, it's essential to consider both their potential as renewable fuels, thus aligning with SDG7, and their effectiveness as carbon sequestration and soil amendment agents, contributing to SDG15. A comprehensive understanding of these processes requires an evaluation of the energy consumption involved in their production, furnishing an overall picture of their efficiency and sustainability. This study concentrates exclusively on the solid byproducts of the HTC and pyrolysis process; to augment sustainability, we assume that the co-products derived from the two processes are repurposed as additives or feedstocks in an Anaerobic Digester (AD) (Sikarwar et al., 2021 ). The decision to concentrate on HTC and pyrolysis is based on their demonstrated effectiveness in biomass conversion and suitability for the feedstocks used in this study. Moreover, the solid products they yield are versatile in their applications for energy recovery and carbon sequestration (Breulmann et al., 2017 ; Cavali et al., 2022 ). While other technologies and products also hold value, our focus in this study is intentionally narrowed to HTC and pyrolysis to ensure detailed optimization of these specific processes and products. A complete mass/energy balance, while valuable for a detailed understanding of these processes, might impose extensive data requirements and add to experimental complexities, potentially detracting from the study's primary objective. Thus, we strategically concentrate our efforts on the key aspects that directly contribute to achieving SDGs. The methodological framework of this work is depicted in Fig. 1  . The methods followed in this study are outlined in several sections. Section 2.1  delineates the process of data collection and subsequent processing. Following this, Section 2.2  delves into the training of multiple ML models utilizing the compiled dataset. This section also expounds upon the methodology employed for determining the importance of input features. Outputs generated by these machine learning models are then used as inputs for the multi-objective optimization model, which is elaborated in Section 2.3 . Subsequently, Section 2.4  introduces the methodological approach of a case study specifically tailored to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Given the uncertainties associated with feedstock composition, Section 2.5  provides a comprehensive overview of the uncertainty analysis. 2.1 Data compilation and preprocessing In light of the substantial volume of experimental data on diverse biomass compositions and process parameters reported in the literature, we harnessed machine learning techniques as a potent tool to predict the properties of thermochemical conversion products. We conducted a thorough literature search using relevant keywords such as “biomass,” “pyrolysis,” “hydrothermal carbonization,” etc., and utilized platforms including Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, from which we assembled a comprehensive dataset on HTC and pyrolysis. Our study sought to ensure generalizability, thus encompassing a variety of features such as the ultimate analysis of the feedstock - which accounts for elemental composition including carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen content; proximate analysis of the feedstock, which captures fixed carbon, ash, and volatile matter; and process conditions, including reaction time, temperature, heating rate, and water content. Hydrochar and biochar labels were characterized based on their yield, high heating value, carbon recovery, energy recovery, and the elemental composition of the product, which aligns with the main applications of HTC and pyrolysis, namely energy generation and carbon sequestration. These product characteristics offer a comprehensive overview of the thermochemical conversion product features, enabling an informed assessment and comparison. The HTC dataset comprises 497 data points with ten features and eight targets, gathered from 70 published works. The distribution of biomass types in the HTC dataset was as follows: lignin or cellulose accounted for 44.0%, food waste for 26.0%, sludge for 17.0%, and manure for 14.0%. In the case of slow pyrolysis, data from 48 literature sources were compiled, resulting in 370 data points. Within the slow pyrolysis dataset, biomass types were as follows: lignin or cellulose accounted for 30.0% of the dataset, food waste for 21.0%, sludge for 22.0%, and algae for 27.0%. Further details pertaining to the dataset can be found in the supplementary dataset.  2.2 Machine learning models This work utilizes three machine learning algorithms as regression models: RF, XGBoost, and DNN. RF and XGBoost, representing classical tree-based machine learning algorithms, have exhibited substantial potential in the field of biomass, as evidenced by their performance in recent studies (Pichler and Hartig, 2023 ). Their enhanced capacity for classification and regression tasks pertaining to thermal conversion processes has been widely recognized and corroborated by multiple investigations (Zhang et al., 2021 ; Zhu et al., 2019 ). The neural network model confers an important advantage in dealing with intricate and non-linear interdependencies often encountered among variables in multivariate systems, such as biomass conversion processes (Khan et al., 2023 ). Next, we allocated 80% of the data points as training datasets, and the remaining 20% served as test datasets. During the training phase, we employed 10-fold cross-validation to tune each model's hyperparameters, enhancing the predictive capability of the models. For the RF model, we tuned the hyperparameters encompassing the number of trees with a range between 1 and 100, the maximum depth of each tree between 1 and 50, maximum features from 1 to 8, minimum sample split from 2 to 11, and minimum sample leaf from 1 to 11. The XGBoost model required the tuning of hyperparameters such as the maximum depth of the tree between 4 and 10, the learning rate with values of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5, the number of trees between 1000 and 5000, and the subsample within the range of 0.5–1.0. In order to prevent overfitting, we increased the colsample by tree and subsample parameters incrementally by 0.1, starting from 0.5 and ending at 1.0. The DNN model's adjustable parameters included the number of layers ranging from 1 to 5, the number of neurons per layer from 0 to 768, and various types of activation functions. To optimize the hyperparameters, we use Optuna (Akiba et al., 2019 ), an open-source optimization framework that offers benefits such as Pythonic search space, easy parallelization, lightweight tuning processes, and rapid visualization (Akiba et al., 2019 ). The determination coefficient (R2 ), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as fitness scores for the RF, XGBoost, and DNN models. Upon optimization of the hyperparameters, we evaluated and selected the best-performing model based on the R2  value. To decipher the results of this selected model and to enhance the interpretability of the outcomes, we implemented the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method (Lundberg and Lee, 2017 ). SHAP is a method based on cooperative game theory that calculates each feature's average marginal contribution to an instance's prediction.  2.3 Multi-objective optimization TCC yields solid products, specifically biochar and hydrochar, which are utilized for two main applications: as alternative fuel sources and as a medium for carbon sequestration. To critically evaluate the benefits associated with these applications, we have chosen two primary indicators, REI (Mahmood et al., 2016 ) and CSI (Li et al., 2021 ). REI quantifies the net energy output from a process relative to the energy expended to execute that process, and its maximization enhances the affordability and efficiency of renewable energy sources derived from waste and supports the transition from fossil fuels. Thus, a high REI value means a greater yield of useable energy is obtained from the biomass feedstock. On the other hand, CSI measures the stability and persistence of the carbon in the char products, which is a crucial factor when these products are used for carbon sequestration and as a soil amendment. A high CSI means that the char is resistant to degradation and can effectively lock away carbon from the atmosphere, which contributes to SDG15's goal of mitigating land degradation and halting biodiversity loss. In this study, our primary objective functions center on maximizing energy recovery and carbon sequestration, both of which directly contribute to achieving SDG7 and SDG15. The decision to focus on these objectives requires us to strategically set aside other potential objective functions, not due to their lack of importance, but because optimizing them might not directly align with our sustainability goals. For instance, while economic factors and nutrient content (e.g., nitrogen footprints) are significant considerations in waste management, they were not included in this study's optimization objectives. While economics is an essential consideration in technology adoption (Awasthi et al., 2021 ), this work focused on the process's technical aspects and environmental impacts. As for nutrients, while they are vital for soil amendments (Zhang et al., 2019 ), this work's primary focus was carbon sequestration and energy recovery. While important, potential objectives like yield maximization or reduction of byproducts do not directly support our sustainability goals. Yield maximization, for example, could lead to the creation of less stable carbon structures, inadvertently counteracting long-term carbon sequestration, which is a central tenet of SDG15. Similarly, the minimization of byproducts, though crucial for environmental protection, does not necessarily contribute to renewable energy production or carbon sequestration. The mathematical formulation is given below. REI is defined using Eq. (1)  (Mahmood et al., 2016 ):(1) R E I = Q c  0.75 Q e  + Q p        where the term Q c   refers to the HHV of the char, which is the useable energy output of the TCC process, the denominator is defined as the total useable energy input, and we adopt the energy balance assumption in TCC systems proposed by various researchers (Mahmood et al., 2016 ). Because we focus solely on the energy spent during the production of solid products, the energy input is defined as 0.75Q e  +Q p  , where Q p   denotes the energy required to heat biomass to the reaction temperature, and Q e   represents the electrical energy necessary for reactor operation. The equations for REI (Eqs. (1)–(6) ) are taken from the relevant literature (Mahmood et al., 2016 ). Q p     is calculated using Eq. (2) , Q p , H 2  O      is calculated by Eq. (3) , and Q p , b i o m a s s      is calculated using Eq. (4) .(2) Q p  = Q p , H 2  O   + Q p , B i o m a s s       (3) Q p , H 2  O   = m H 2  O   × ( H H 2  O  T  − H H 2  O  298 K    )      (4) Q p , b i o m a s s   = m b i o m a s s   × ∫ 298 K  T  C p  d T     C p     is defined in Eq. (5) , where T  is the temperature in Kelvin, and represents the specific heat capacity of the biomass. Parameter values for Eq. (5)  are taken from an approximation of wet waste's specific heat capacity as a temperature function (Dupont et al., 2014 ).(5) C p  = 5.34 × T − 299     where H H 2  O  T     is the specific enthalpy of water at temperature T  (ToolBox, 2009 ), m H 2  O      is the mass of the water in the feedstock, and m B i o m a s s      is the mass of the biomass feedstock. Electrical energy is used to maintain the temperature at the desired level and is calculated using the formula:(6) Q e  = P ⋅ t     where P  is the specified power of the heating element, and t  is the reaction time. CSI is defined in Eq. (7)  (Li et al., 2021 ):(7) C S I = ( C P r o d u c t   C B i o m a s s    − ( H + O + N  3 × C   )  P r o d u c t    )  × Y i e l d P r o d u c t        CSI is comprised of two parts, the carbon content recovery rate and the element ratio. The carbon content recovery rate is determined by calculating the ratio of carbon content in the product to the carbon content in the biomass, multiplied by the product yield, which provides valuable insights into the efficiency of carbon capture and utilization in the conversion process (Li et al., 2021 ). The element ratio is an essential indicator for assessing the efficacy of char for carbon sequestration, as it measures the carbon structure of the char by defining the ratio of the sum of the nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen contents to the carbon content in char (Leng et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2021 ). Next, we formulated the optimization problem using Pymoo (Blank and Deb, 2020 ), an interface for modeling optimization problems in Python. We chose the epsilon constraints method to optimize the CSI and REI of our TCC processes due to its ability to systematically generate Pareto optimal solutions, especially in problems with multiple objectives (Laumanns et al., 2006 ; Mesquita-Cunha et al., 2023 ). This method transforms a multi-objective problem into a series of single-objective problems, which are then individually solved. By adjusting the values of these constraints, we derive a collection of Pareto optimal solutions that trade-off CSI and REI. The mathematic optimization problem is formulated as follows, solving this problem once for each element in M :  min − ( C S I + ε ⋅ R E I m   )      s.t. R E I m  ≤ λ m  , m ∈ M      ∑ u i  = 100 , i ∈ I , u ∈ U    ∑ p j  = 100 , j ∈ J , p ∈ P    x k L  ≤ x k  ≤ x k U  , k ∈ K , x ∈ X         where M  represents a set denoting the number of upper bounds associated with the objective of REI, which is then constrained to six equally spaced values between the lower and upper bounds. of the REI. These solutions are labeled BC1–6 for pyrolysis and HC1-6 for HTC solutions. λ  signifies the maximum value for each REI iteration. U  encapsulates the ultimate analysis balance, while P  denotes the proximate analysis balance. Set I,  and U  correspond to the ultimate analysis count and compositions. Set J  and P  correspond to the proximate analysis count and compositions. K  stands for the number of inequality constraints. X  is a set symbolizing the bounds of the variables, which includes constraints on the process conditions. These parameters' lower and upper boundaries are represented by L  and U , respectively. Finally, ε  takes a value of 1, 9, 6, 3, 2, 0.001 for points BC1-BC6 and 0.001, 4.5, 9, 2.8, 2.4, 0.001 for points HC1-HC6.  2.4 Case study Food waste, one of the main components of wet waste, has been selected as our case study because of its potential for sustainable waste management and energy production, aligning with the objectives of SDGs. Moreover, statutory regulations like the Food Donation and Food Scraps Recycling law, implemented by New York State in 2022, stipulate that commercial entities generating more than 1.8 metric tons of food waste per week must dispose of it in an environmentally friendly manner (Hochu and Seggos, 2022 ). In this case study, we examine food waste samples, typically fruits, vegetables, and meats sourced from major producers like supermarkets, restaurants, and universities (Pecchi et al., 2022 ). The features' maximum and minimum values within the HTC and pyrolysis datasets are outlined in Table 1  . To structure our analysis, we identify the operating parameters of two thermal conversion processes as decision variables while the proximate and ultimate analyses are fixed. These include:• For the HTC process, variables comprise water content (WC), reaction time (RT), and temperature (T).  • For the pyrolysis process, variables include temperature (T), reaction time (RT), and heating rate (HR).     2.5 Uncertainty analysis In this study, we particularly pay attention to the uncertainty and error arising from variability in feedstock composition - specifically, the elemental composition of the feedstock. To quantify and comprehend the uncertainties better, we employ a Monte Carlo simulation-based approach, focusing primarily on uncertainties in the proximate and ultimate analysis of the feedstock composition (Tao et al., 2023 ). This simulation technique, a powerful mathematical method that utilizes iterative random sampling to achieve numerical outcomes, facilitates a comprehensive exploration of potential outcomes and their likelihood within a defined scenario (Zio and Zio, 2013 ). We conduct the simulation 100,000 times to determine the probability distribution for REI and CSI, assuming a log-normal distribution for the dataset sample (Owsianiak et al., 2016 ). 100,000 simulations are enough to ensure reliability by capturing sufficient variability in the chemical composition of the food waste feedstock. Detailed parameters utilized in the uncertainty analysis are presented in Table 2  , with input parameters bearing uncertainty marked by their respective standard deviations (SD). Python is used to generate the log-normal samples, which are then fed as inputs into the optimal ML models with fixed operating conditions. For the uncertainty analysis, we have selected points HC1 and HC6 for the HTC process and points BC1 and BC6 for the pyrolysis process because they represent the two ends of the Pareto front, providing optimal solutions for either CSI or REI. These points embody the extreme trade-off scenarios between energy efficiency and carbon sequestration, enabling us to explore the full range of uncertainties and reveal the inherent variability in the feedstock composition's impact on both objectives. This systematic approach allows us to investigate the robustness of our optimization results while accounting for inherent uncertainties within the feedstock composition.   3 Results and discussion 3.1 HTC and pyrolysis dataset analysis The collected dataset for HTC and pyrolysis is analyzed to examine its statistical characteristics. Key statistical measures values for input and output features are in Table S1  and Table S2 . For both data sets, but especially in pyrolysis, the proximate and ultimate composition of the feedstock and char have significant correlations amongst themselves and with each other. To gain initial insights into the relationship between the features and targets, a preliminary correlation analysis was conducted using the Pearson correlation, shown in Fig. 2  . Primarily, carbon in biomass manifests a significant positive correlation with Char_C (coefficient: 0.79, p < 0.001), and with the high heating value (HHV) of hydrochar, indicated by a coefficient of 0.76 (p < 0.001). This correlation suggests that an increase in the carbon content in biomass proportionally enhances both the carbon composition within the hydrochar and HHV of the hydrochar. Observing the process conditions correlation coefficients, T exhibits a notable negative correlation with Char_yield and H content, at −0.43 and −0.54, respectively. This suggests that as the temperature of the HTC process increases, the char yield and H content tend to decrease. Conversely, the correlation with Char_C and HHV is positive at 0.29 and 0.28, respectively, indicating an increase in both as the temperature increases. The analysis demonstrates that within the data range used, the RT does not exhibit a strong correlation with other variables, as all the coefficients are close to zero. This suggests that the impact of RT on the outcomes of the HTC process may be relatively minor within the specific data range examined. While the Pearson correlation coefficient can be used as the basis for feature selection, in the case of HTC, all features have at least one statistically significant relationship with the labels. The correlation analysis of biomass features and prediction targets in the context of the pyrolysis process reveals some intriguing relationships. The most significant negative correlation is noted between char yield and the temperature (T, coefficient: -0.70, p < 0.001), implying that higher char yields are more likely to be achieved at lower pyrolysis temperatures. Moreover, the feature RT (min) has relatively weak correlations with all features and targets, with the strongest being a positive correlation with ash content at 0.33, suggesting that a longer residence time might slightly increase the ash content. The heating rate also shows weak correlations overall. Its strongest correlation is a moderate positive one with H at 0.37, suggesting that a higher heating rate might slightly increase the hydrogen content. All features have statistically significant correlations with the labels, so there is no need to remove unnecessary features from the ML models.  3.2 Performance evaluation of ML models After optimizing the hyperparameters, the performance of each model in each thermochemical conversion process was compared to determine the optimal model. The optimal hyperparameter values can be found Table S3  and Table S4 . In the HTC system, the XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance, with R2  scores ranging between 0.90 and 0.95. Similarly, for the Pyrolysis process, the XGBoost model outperformed the others, evidenced by R2  scores spanning from 0.69 to 0.98. Comparatively, both the DNN and RF models yielded less favorable results, as corroborated by the R2  values in Tables S5 and S6 , particularly for HTC. Furthermore, the MAPE values for the DNN models are significantly higher than the MAPE values for the XGBoost or RF models, regardless of the process. This could be attributed to the limitations of the DNN model in multi-target prediction, including possible overfitting/underfitting, which is not as accurate as the tree-based models (Guo et al., 2021 ). The predictions of the tuned XGBoost and RF models are validated with the test set, and the specific R2  and RMSE are shown in Figs. 3 and 4   . The linear fit line and prediction band in the figure offer a comprehensive depiction of both the model's accuracy (how closely the predicted values match the experimental data) and precision (the consistency of the predictions) To validate our results, we provide a comparison of model metrics for related ML work. Table 3   overviews recent papers applying ML techniques to model pyrolysis and HTC. In general, our models have demonstrated satisfactory predictive performance.  3.3 Feature importance To uncover the key factors influencing the efficiency and quality of HTC utilizing XGBoost and pyrolysis employing RF, a comprehensive feature importance analysis was conducted by leveraging SHAP values. Presented in Fig. 5  a are the feature importance values for the HTC process. The most significant determinant emerged as temperature (T), demonstrated by its notably high SHAP value of 24.58. It was trailed by carbon content (C) and hydrogen content (H), with SHAP values of 16.5 and 16.08, respectively. This sequence of importance suggests that fluctuations in temperature, followed by the carbon and hydrogen content, substantially impact the HTC process's efficiency and quality. In contrast, the feature importance analysis for the pyrolysis process, displayed in Fig. 5 b, presents a slightly different hierarchy of influential factors. Similar to HTC, temperature (T) was identified as the paramount factor, registering an even more considerable SHAP value of 38.02. However, ash and carbon content (C) emerged as the succeeding influential factors for pyrolysis. In both pyrolysis and HTC processes, operating conditions beyond temperature, specifically the water content and residence time for the HTC process, and the residence time and heating rate of the pyrolysis process exhibited relatively low feature importance. These results underscore the significant impact of both elemental composition and proximate analysis on the process outcomes, highlighting that merely optimizing process conditions might not fully maximize the potential of converting wet waste into fuel. Therefore, an uncertainty analysis becomes instrumental in understanding the interplay between the characteristics of the char product and the variations in ultimate and proximate analysis parameters. Feature selection is not performed based on the SHAP values because all features are relevant to the model outputs.  3.4 Pareto optimal solutions for HTC and pyrolysis pathway Following the ε-constraint method for optimization, we have conducted 6 CSI-maximization instances with a cap on REI set at six different values distributed between its minimum and maximum values, and the resultant Pareto Front is depicted in Fig. 6  . For comparison purposes, a baseline was established using an experimental setting for the HTC process, which incorporated a heating temperature of 250 °C and a 60-min residence time (Pecchi et al., 2022 ). In the HTC process, a decline in the REI cap from 14.43 to 2.88 led to an increase in the CSI from 24.62 to 49.99. Concurrently, in the pyrolysis process, as the cap on the REI reduced from 13.79 to 4.87, the CSI escalated from 53.18 to 57.98. Remarkably, the REI witnessed a sharp decline when it fell below approximately 9.0 during the pyrolysis process. From an energy return perspective, the solutions BC1 and HC1, found in the upper-left region of the Pareto Front, presented the highest REI, thus making them the preferable choice. Conversely, solutions BC6 and HC6, located in the lower-right corner, exhibited the highest CSI, indicating their superior carbon stability. Given this range of outcomes on the Pareto frontier, the selection of the optimal solution can be tailored to suit specific needs. Table 4   elucidates the proximate and ultimate analysis of raw feedstocks, hydrochar in the experimental setting, and the HTC and pyrolysis front solutions, thereby exposing the compositional changes contingent on the process conditions. The process condition for BC1, as outlined in Table 4 , consists of a reaction temperature of 300.22 °C, a residence time of 10.03 min, and a heating rate of 19.98 °C/min. These process parameters, characterized by relatively low temperature, residence time, and a high heating rate, are designed to maximize the energy return on investment, which resonates with the first and third targets of SDG7: affordable, reliable energy services and improved energy efficiency. Conversely, maximizing the CSI of biochar requires process conditions that include a higher reaction temperature (319.33 °C), extended residence time (90.39 min), and a slower heating rate (17.15 °C/min). The shifts from higher REI to lower CSI echo the fundamental objectives of SDG15, which seeks to promote life on land through sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. Existing literature corroborates these trends, indicating that higher pyrolysis temperatures encourage the cleavage of aliphatic substances, leading to aromatics formation and biochar with lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratios (H/C) (Hoang et al., 2021 ). Lower heating rates are crucial in extending biomass exposure to high temperatures, facilitating a more pronounced interruption between the initial and subsequent thermal cracking stages. This interruption favors the production of solid products (Xiong et al., 2018 ). This reinforces the significance of temperature as the most influential factor in biochar stability. The HTC Pareto curve is positioned in the upper left corner in relation to the pyrolysis curve, indicating a higher REI and a lower CSI. The lower CSI can be attributed to the rapid decomposition of hydrochar in soil due to its physical instability, as documented in previous studies (Malghani et al., 2013 ). Examining the solutions ranging from HC4 to HC6, it is evident that the feedstock water content and heating temperatures are similar across this range but are differentiated by increasing residence time, which leads to a trade-off between energy efficiency and hydrochar stability. Residence time has been reported to play a crucial role at high temperatures, with longer residence times generally associated with increased reaction severity, which favors the generation of solid materials over their liquid or gaseous counterparts (Sharma et al., 2020 ).  3.5 Van Krevelen diagram analysis In this section, we examine the characteristics of the solid products generated by the two processes using Van Krevelen diagrams based on ultimate analysis results (Fig. 7  ). The enhanced carbon stability observed in biochar is attributed to a significant shift in its molecular composition, resulting in a higher percentage of fused aromatic structures (McBeath et al., 2015 ). This carbon structure can be forecasted by analyzing the molar ratios of H/C or O/C (Lehmann et al., 2021 ), which has gained recognition from the International Biochar Initiative (IBI, 2015 ) as the prevailing indicators for evaluating char stability (Leng et al., 2019 ). In the Van Krevelen diagram, most solid biochar products are positioned in the Bituminous region, indicating relatively low O/C and H/C ratios. The atomic H/C and O/C ratios of the biochar produced are significantly lower than those of the feedstock and HTC. Notably, the BC1 solution stands out from the other five solutions as it falls within the lignite region. By comparing the reaction conditions of BC1, it is observed that this solution exhibits the lowest reaction temperature and residence time, suggesting decreased reaction progression and lower stability of the resulting biochar product. While this limits its potential for biological carbon sequestration, it remains the most energy-efficient solution, reflecting the delicate balance between SDG7 and SDG15. In contrast, hydrochar products predominantly fall within the lignite region, located in the upper right region of the biochar diagram, indicating relatively higher O/C and H/C ratios. Specifically, HC6 is situated in the lower left corner of the HC solution cluster. This solution displays a significantly longer residence time compared to the other solutions, thereby enhancing decarbonization and dehydrogenation processes, and rendering it more suited for carbon sequestration, thus aligning with the targets of SDG15. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that chars derived from food waste can be classified as high-grade coal, characterized by substantial carbon content and low impurities, thus adding significant value. The O/C ratio of all char products falls within the range of O/C < 0.6, indicating a half-life of 100–1000 years (Klasson, 2017 ). This offers a sustainable path to sequester carbon, enhance energy efficiency, and contribute towards achieving the objectives outlined in both SDG7 and SDG15.  3.6 Uncertainty analysis of the case study For the HTC process (Fig. 8  ), the uncertainty analysis revealed a 95% confidence interval for REI between 14.11 and 14.87 and for CSI between 20.54 and 27.13. The larger range of uncertainty for the optimal CSI solution indicated a greater sensitivity of the carbon sequestration capacity to feedstock composition alterations compared to the fuel quality. The pyrolysis process showed a similar trend (Fig. 9  ). Despite a smaller uncertainty associated with the optimal REI value (95% confidence interval of 12.85–13.97 for BC1 and 4.67–4.96 for BC6), the CSI optimal solution exhibited a considerably higher range of uncertainty (55.87–63.46 for BC6). This disparity underscores the increased sensitivity of the carbon sequestration capacity to changes in feedstock composition in the pyrolysis process as well. Notably, the sensitivity of CSI remained consistently higher across both processes, suggesting that the carbon sequestration potential of biochar and hydrochar is significantly influenced by feedstock composition. Such findings have critical implications for crafting carbon sequestration strategies. For instance, waste management facilities could potentially utilize this insight to refine their practices toward optimal carbon capture by selecting and processing feedstock compositions that enhance carbon stability in their conversion products. Further bolstering the model's reliability is the close congruence between the optimized solutions for both REI and CSI and the mean values derived from the simulations. This correlation not only testifies to the model's robust predictive capability but also affirms that the model is well-calibrated. The consistent alignment of predicted and optimized values underscores the reliability of the framework, presenting it as a dependable tool for decision-making in the optimization of TCC processes.   4 Conclusions In this study, we developed an ML-assisted multi-objective optimization framework, providing a novel approach to predicting and tailoring the properties of solid products derived from the thermochemical conversion of wet waste. The framework was applied to a wet food waste case study, demonstrating a robust comparative analysis of the energy-rich products obtained from HTC and pyrolysis processes. Our selected machine learning models, XGBoost for HTC and pyrolysis, successfully predicted the properties of the thermally converted wet waste products and optimized the CSI and REI, vital indicators for assessing the carbon sequestration potential and energy efficiency, respectively. The R2 values for these models are mostly greater than 0.90, meeting or exceeding R2 values reported in the literature for similar ML model of TCC conversion of biomass. The feature importance analysis revealed temperature as the most influential factor in determining the primary product properties, echoing the findings from our optimization. This study introduced a novel approach to understanding and tailoring biochar and hydrochar production, with specific solutions offering optimal REI and CSI outcomes. Using Pareto solutions generated from our model, we demonstrated the optimization framework's capability in facilitating the sustainable transformation of wet waste into valuable products. In terms of applications, our analysis unveiled a significant distinction between HTC and pyrolysis processes. HTC emerged as the optimal process for maximizing REI, while pyrolysis excelled in maximizing CSI. These insights can guide researchers and practitioners in selecting and optimizing the most suitable process based on specific needs - whether focusing on energy efficiency, where HTC would be preferred, or carbon sequestration, where pyrolysis would be advantageous. The study made substantial strides in reinforcing the primary objectives of SDG7 and SDG15. However, the environmental benefits of these clean fuels could be overstated, as a life cycle assessment to evaluate the environmental impacts of the production of these products is not conducted. Furthermore, the nutrient content of the products is not modeled, which could increase resistance to applying these products directly to land. Finally, the secondary yields, which can include an energy-rich bio-oil, from these reactions are not modeled. To address these limitations, future research could incorporate more features and labels in the ML models to improve the estimation of yields and chemical characteristics. The optimization objectives could be enhanced by adding environmental considerations and nutrient content. Such advancements would enrich our understanding of the trade-offs inherent in TCC processes.
