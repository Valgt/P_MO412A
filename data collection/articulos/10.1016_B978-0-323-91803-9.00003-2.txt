               As environmental doomsday predictions become uncomfortably close to reality, the world must accelerate actions aimed at providing solutions, both for the life of the planet and for the present and future generations of people living on it. The United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which constitute a collaborative roadmap outlining global issues that require immediate attention.
               These goals are designed to lead to actions that end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 (i.e., 8 years from now), all people enjoy peace and prosperity. This chapter focuses primarily on goals 2 and 3, and it provides highlights with respect to the pivotable roles that seaweeds can play to help achieve them. Specifically, seaweeds can help end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and ensure healthy lives and well-being for all. Radically improving agricultural sustainability is a high priority, and seaweeds and their extracts can make important contributions to food production systems (i.e., from field to fork). Key nutritional components present in marine macroalgae offer opportunities to displace or supplement some ingredients in prepared or processed foods in favor of improved, broader nutrition. Research on the utilization of seaweeds in agriculture is also highlighted, and calls to action to meet the SDGs are loud and increasing, and seaweeds can be a viable part of the solution.

Introduction It is generally understood that a fully integrated and global approach is essential in order to meet the future demands of world food production under the conditions of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth in the 2015 Paris Agreement (https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement ). “Under the conditions” means, in part, that the negative environmental footprint widely attributed to current agricultural production practices, the primary source of our food supply, must be minimized. Yet, we need to produce almost 50% more good-quality sustenance by the year 2050. More than 10 millennia of agricultural development have evolved into numerous massive, intensively managed operations, often corporately owned and endorsed, and typically based upon unsustainable, GHG-emitting activities, agro-chemical inputs, deforestation, extensive potable water use, and fossil fuel consumption (i.e., transportation and crop production). Not only will the world require more food in the future, but the health and wellness of all individuals must also be considered and met accordingly. A significant challenge indeed! Obviously, the results of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently the war between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine (2022), will have enormous negative impacts on an already desperate situation for so many. Statistics published in 2020 (http://www.un.org/en/global-issues/food ) indicated almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019—up by 10 million from 2018, and up by nearly 60 million in 5 years. It is anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic could push over 130 million more people into a chronic hunger situation by the current year, 2021, and this number will continue to rise with food shortages predicted as Ukraine was the “bread basket” of Europe. Negative impacts regarding human, animal, and environmental health and wellness will necessarily follow suit. If these impacts are included with the anticipated need for increased sustainable food production by 2050, then the tasks of meeting the hunger-related SDGs in the allocated timeframe seem daunting. Significant efforts are being focused on global hunger and food security issues, and the success of the eight Millennial Development Goals established by world leaders at the United Nations in 2000 is encouraging, https://www5.worldbank.org/mdgs/ . The focus of those goals was to fight extreme poverty, and their implementation reduced by half the number of people living under such dire conditions. The proportion of undernourished people in the developing regions also fell by almost half, further proof of the close connections between poverty and poor health. However, reaching the second SDG of the Paris Agreement, “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture” by 2030 will be an enormous, and complicated undertaking. Agricultural food production is not the only element impacting the achievement of the food and nutrition-related SDGs. Politics, serious economic fluctuations, regional crises and/or conflict and wars, crop failures and disease, extreme weather events, and associated catastrophes have tremendously negative influences as well. In addition, reducing food waste and reclaiming degraded and  unproductive farmlands will help lower the need for massive increases in land expansion and or synthetic, chemical fertilizer applications for food production. The FAO (2017)  (https://www.fao.org/nr/sustainability/food-loss-and-waste/en/ ) estimated that each year, approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption in the world was lost or wasted; this continues to be the case. Failures to adequately address food wastage in particular represent missed opportunities to improve global food security, and also mitigate environmental impacts and resource use by food chains. Not only is food waste costly in terms of lost production, but it must ultimately be trucked to landfills and open dumps, where its disposal generates damaging methane emissions. These emissions from solid food waste grew by 30% between 1990 and 2018, reaching 594 Mt CO2  eq year−1  (Tubiello et al., 2021 ). Tempus fugit , and while some progress is being made, “smarter” and faster actions, based upon good science, are required to overcome the challenges facing the global food system. The 17 SDGs clearly outline the main issues, and there are many proposed or even pilot-scale solutions for various aspects of the goals, but they currently remain fragmented pieces of positivity. Support, education, and publicity by divisions of the UN, the World Bank Group, The Nature Conservancy, and others have helped generate tremendous interest in seaweeds by various social and governmental agencies in countries and regions around the world, especially those with access to coastlines. Well-researched cautions have also been issued by a collective of highly experienced scientists (SAMS policy brief #06, 2021 ), highlighting reasons to tread cautiously in the development of such a far-reaching and versatile resource of potentially global impact. With the current availability of so much quality research and in consideration of the long timeline necessary for the overall scale-up of any arrangement destined to affect the global food system, action appears to be past due but not too late. Credible resources, such as the chapters in this book, are a wealth of information. To improve the world's food systems enough to actually make an impact, an essential action plan must be implemented sooner rather than later. It will not be simple by any means, but if a need is urgent, as was apparent with the development of a COVID vaccine, instilling widespread cooperation and collaboration, macroalgae can be made to function as a fundamentally nutritious food or ingredient. For this to happen, it may be necessary for the global food production/supply systems to experience a truly disruptive change, and seaweeds should be a part of that. There is support, there is a rationale, there is research, there is initiative and investment, but there is precious little time to waste. Three specific, but complex challenges are defined in the 2019 World Resources Report (World Resources Institute, https://www.wri.org/research/creating-sustainable-food-future ), these are:1. food supply,  2. land use, and  3. greenhouse gas emissions.    To address them effectively, a multi-pronged approach geared toward solutions should be employed, and in many instances throughout the 17 SDGs, as highlighted below, seaweeds can unequivocally contribute, and with the appropriate collective will and investments, seaweeds could provide beneficial deliverables within the short term. Furthermore, when produced in aquaculture, seaweeds are considered to be one of the most sustainable marine crops, along with bivalves (Duarte et al., 2021 ; Gephart et al., 2021 ). Paradoxically, algae have been overlooked altogether in one of the most cited high-level reports on food in the Anthropocene epoch (Jacquin et al., 2014 ; Willett et al., 2019 ) (Fig. 4.1 ).  This chapter focuses primarily on how seaweeds can make globally important contributions to the delivery and qualities of human food and nutrition, which are directly related to UN SDGs 2 and 3, viz., “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”, and “Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages”, respectively. Indeed, these goals are closely integrated with one another, and in some cases, they cover different facets of the same issues. Areas where various types of seaweeds can impact other SDGs may be commented upon, but many of these will require a more in-depth analysis of their own. It is acknowledged that microalgae, as an important autotrophic group of mainly unicellular organisms, also play similar roles in human health and nutrition, but the focus here must remain on the macroalgae, multicellular autotrophs commonly known as seaweeds. Decades-old research (even centuries) on seaweeds is reaching new heights of refinement, and increasingly more evidence points to the plethora of possible benefits to human health and wellness. Adequate investment in robust human nutritional studies, which are often costly and complicated, remains one of the primary roadblocks to commercial development. In order to mobilize talk into action, an integrated approach is essential, and it will require addressing various market forces and elements to realize the aim of improving the health and longevity of our planet and all the people who share it (Jacquin et al., 2014 ). What is the role of seaweeds? This means fundamentally that the resources (i.e., wild harvested and/or responsibly cultivated) must be properly managed on the supply side in terms of stability, consistency, security of supply, safety, and traceability. Furthermore, the efficacy of claims for utilization of selected seaweeds must be scientifically supported. Any potential negative impacts on the environment as a result of cultivation or wild harvesting, need to be assessed and  ameliorated, understanding that there are consequences of all types of actions and costs of production must not be uneconomic. Currently, fewer than 100 species of seaweed are utilized across the globe, while there are at least 12,000 to choose from. This potentially offers prospects of matching some individual species or groups of macroalgae to specific or specialized applications, concomitantly providing local economic advantages to residents in the promotion of niche markets. Some of these macroalgal activities are commodity-based at the scale of large multinational corporations, and reaching all the way to family farms and entrepreneurial microbusinesses. Whole and ground, dried seaweed biomass ensures stability, versatility, and prolonged shelf life, making it widely transportable. Benefits such as local employment opportunities, especially for women and families, can be further exploited and expanded upon, contributing to health and wellness from an economic and psychological perspective. Corporations could contribute by making an investment in formulation development and creating formats appropriate for distribution and delivery to achieve desired effects, whether nutritional, medical, or both. Research efforts undertaken to address all these potentially complex issues, among others, are important, and they really must be done in collaboration with growers, multinational scientists from multiple disciplines, and support from governments, funding agencies, and local communities. The appropriate utilization of specific seaweeds of choice must be both universally acceptable and the resource must be readily available. Dedicated interest groups may need to be created whose primary role is to increase the impact of seaweed-related academic research on policy. These are important to help educate and promote decision-making activities that could lead to effective global strategies for applications of various seaweeds in the hunger/nutrition, health/wellness remediation portfolios. This is not unlike the case for other nutritious foods in the human food chain. With the development of the 2015 Paris Agreement, it is apparent that policy-makers acknowledge there is a problem, as characterized and outlined in the 17 SDGs, and a viable solution in various types of seaweeds (as with crop plants) is tentatively available, as research has demonstrated, and now decision-makers must instill the political will endorsed by productive actions. With well over 800 million people expected to be chronically food-destitute by 2022, the situation appears dire, and it is important to acknowledge food supply is not the only concern. Issues surrounding global levels of hunger are complex and include socioeconomic factors, food quality/availability, and its equitable distribution (World Resources Report, 2019 ). While the global hunger issue is extremely serious, there exists an anomaly in that there is a  global obesity epidemic well underway. Following are recent estimates published in WHO (2021)  factsheet on overweight and obesity (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight ): In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and older were overweight. Of these over 650 million adults were obese. In 2016, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over (39% of men and 40% of women) were overweight. Overall, about 13% of the world's adult population (11% of men and 15% of women) were obese in 2016. The worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016. Hunger, as described in UN SDG 2, is characterized as: “Not consuming enough calories to meet minimum physiological needs, or not intaking adequate protein, energy, and micronutrients to maintain wellness.” Severe food insecurity is another factor contributing to hunger, where people lack reliable access to, or the resources to afford adequate amounts of safe and nutrient-dense foods, necessary for normal growth and development. Much is already known about the nutritional components required to sustain good health, and quality protein is always in demand to provide essential building blocks for animal tissues, and which are typically provided by meat, fish, eggs, pulses, or milk products. Under the conditions of the SDGs, it is also essential to produce good-quality, nutrient-dense food and to manufacture, package, and distribute it under well-balanced and productive environmental conditions. UN SDG 3 relates to the promotion of healthy lives and well-being, a tantalizing and timely goal for those who have long studied and researched the therapeutic values of some of the >12,000 species of seaweeds globally. Central to the widespread issue of good health and well-being, defined as a state of positivity with a sense of meeting full potential at all physiological levels (Simmons & Baldwin, 2021 ), are maternal mortality rates and the preventable deaths of newborns and children. In 2019, 47% of all under-5 deaths occurred in the newborn period, with about one-third dying on the day of birth and close to three-quarters dying within the first week of life (WHO, 2020 ) https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/newborns-reducing-mortality . While lack of good quality care and treatment after birth plays a considerable role, the nutritional status of the mother during and after pregnancy is equally important for providing essential nutrients and boosting the innate immunity of the child (von Schenck et al., 1997 ). Further adding to the gloom, increasing rates of noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular pathologies not only negatively impact human health, but they can also create financial hardship as a result of long-term drug costs, and collectively put strain on care networks. Preventative efforts need to be further directed at these diseases, and health and wellness play important roles. In addition, a just and humanitarian society is compelled to strive to end epidemics of communicable diseases, such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, as examples. Seldom making international headlines, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect approximately 1.4 billion people. Estimates place globally close to 35,000 deaths daily as a result of these diseases (Cohen et al., 2016 ). NTDs are a group of parasitic, bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, such as leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and dengue fever. While widespread, they are especially prevalent among the poor in tropical and subtropical regions (Freile-Pelegrin & Tasdemir, 2019 ; Hotez et al., 2007 ). While by no means a solution to all of the woes of the world, various seaweeds used wisely and judiciously, based in part on traditional knowledge (Pérez-Lloréns et al., 2018 ) and ultimately on science-based evidence, can offer exceptional capabilities toward attenuating disease and promoting healthy lives and well-being. Also linked to health and well-being are aspects of the remaining 15 UN SDGs, some of which seaweeds can also make significant contributions to in terms of economic development, education, and wellness. These are also relevant, but not specifically addressed in detail in this review. For example, UN SDG 1: “End poverty in all its forms, everywhere.” The sustainable development of seaweed industries in coastal communities already provides economic security and the ability to purchase healthier food in a number of countries (Msuya & Hurtado, 2017 ; Rebours et al., 2014 ). Poverty is debilitating and difficult to escape, but the careful development of local opportunities presented by seaweeds is a useful tool toward relief, and work to that effect, by organizations such as ‘Global Seaweed STAR,’ and the Scottish Association of Marine Sciences (SAMS), an associate institute of the United Nations University (https://www.globalseaweed.org/?page_id=2521 , https://www.scidev.net/sub-saharan-africa/news/project-aid-seaweed-developing-nations/ ) has been recently completed in many regions. With care and caution, the industry can be so easily expanded further, but the appropriate research must follow suit. Hussin and Khoso (2017)  report a deficiency in accurate information on the cultural, social, and economic issues associated with seaweed farming in certain coastal regions of Malaysia. Caution is warranted, as such incomplete datasets can lead to poor decision-making and/or flawed management of the human dimension by development agencies, funding groups, and governments, therefore defeating the purpose.  SDG goals 2 and 3—Roles for seaweeds End hunger-improve nutrition!  Sustainable development Goal 2 : “End Hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”.  Ensure healthy lives-promote well-being!  Sustainable development Goal 3 : “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” Few, if any, components of goals 2 and 3 can stand in isolation of the others, as hunger, food security, health, and well-being are closely integrated, and “sustainable agriculture” is a necessary avenue to help achieve these. Therefore, points raised regarding the rationale for the utilization of selected seaweeds to help meet these goals assumes an integrated approach, while highlighting key topics such as nutrition, health and wellbeing, and sustainable agriculture. A myriad of factors can contribute to chronic hunger. They include social status, demographics, economic resources, internal conflicts, and wars. At the time of writing, a food security catastrophe is underway in Afghanistan following the takeover of the country by the Taliban. There is currently a deadly war occurring in Ukraine. Armed conflicts, intercommunal violence, and other localized tensions in East Africa continue to affect peace and security in those regions. A report by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN) (2020)  published before the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the growing influence of economic crises on acute food insecurity levels, particularly in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Haiti, and Sudan. These challenges require more than food availability to resolve associated extreme hunger issues, especially for children, but steps to resolve them, however small, must certainly be undertaken. The combined nutritional qualities of a wide variety of seaweeds that can be utilized are extensive; some can be commoditized, and the positive impact that other facets of their exploitation can offer is a much-welcomed side-effect (Blikra et al., 2021 ; Larson et al., 2020 ; Mouritsen, 2013 ; Mouritsen et al., 2021 ; Nakhate & van der Meer, 2021 ; Rebours et al., 2014 ). Hunger is defined as a chronic condition of undernourishment that occurs when a person does not consistently consume enough dietary calories to sustain a normal, healthy, and active life. Food insecurity blooms where people lack secure and stable access to adequate amounts of safe, nutrient-dense foods that are essential for normal growth and development. Such a diet must include enough protein, healthy fats, carbohydrates, and a range of minerals, micronutrients, and vitamins. Agriculture is the primary source of food globally, but its environmental impact contributes to the climate crisis, further facilitating disruptive events for farmers and others. In a detailed analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from food systems for the period 1990 to 2018, Tubiello et al. (2021)  estimated that about 16 Gt CO2  eq year−1  were generated in 2018, approximately one-third of the global anthropogenic total for that year. Researchers Ritchie and Roser (2021)  presented the following sobering points regarding the environmental impacts of food and agriculture: Food production accounts for over a quarter (26%) of global GHG emissions. Half of the world's habitable land is used for agriculture. 70% of global freshwater withdrawals are used for agriculture. 78% of the global ocean and freshwater eutrophication (the pollution of waterways with nutrient-rich pollutants) is caused by agriculture. 94% of mammal biomass (excluding humans) is livestock. Livestock outweighs wild mammals by a factor of 15:1, and of the 28,000 species threatened with extinction, agriculture, and aquaculture are listed as threats for 24,000 of them. The global food system is in need of some significant repair and modification, yet despite the urgency, new ideas, innovations, and development plans must proceed with great caution.  Protein Protein is the most fundamental component of tissues in animals, plants, and humans. It is made up of varied numbers of 20 different amino acids, all linked by peptide bonds. Amino acids provide nitrogen, hydrocarbon skeletons, and sulfur, which, among others, are absolutely vital components for human health and wellness. It is the essential amino acids (EAA), which must be obtained from food sources, that are the precursors to the synthesis of proteins, peptides, and low molecular weight substances, such as glutathione, creatine, nitric oxide, dopamine, serotonin, RNA, and DNA (Wu, 2009 ). Protein source and quality are influential in this respect, for its hydrolysis in the lumen and small intestine ultimately provides the substrate in the form of amino acid building blocks, ready to be reconfigured and reused according to functionality and demand. The mixture and types of amino acids determine the nutritional value of the protein (San Gabriel & Uneyama, 2013 ; Wu, 2016 ), and collectively, macroalgae are known to contain all the amino acids and other essential nutrients necessary for human growth and development, with the exception of adequate calories (MacArtain et al., 2007 ; Mouritsen, 2013 ; Paiva et al., 2014 ; Pereira, 2011 ). Taurine is an amino acid that does not play a part in the structure of proteins but has an important role in cellular metabolism since it is involved in the synthesis of bile salts, which bind to cholesterol molecules and regulate their levels in the body. In addition, it is an amino acid that is not abundant in the Western diet but very present in the diet of Eastern countries where large amounts of fish, shellfish, and macroalgae, particularly red seaweeds (e.g., 100 g of  dry nori  contains about 1 to 1.3 g of taurine) are consumed (Cho & Rhee, 2020 ; Kawasaki et al., 2017 ). Protein (as in constituent amino acids) undernutrition results in numerous human pathologies, including stunting, anemia, physical weakness, edema, vascular dysfunction, and impaired immunity, to name but a few. The recommended dietary allowance of protein for a healthy adult with low physical activity is 0.8 g kg−1  body weight day−1  (WHO technical report series 935, 2007; https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf?ua=1 ). Essential also for bone health, protein is one of the fundamental nutrients that will be necessary to feed 9.8 billion people by 2050, with a projected food production increase by more than 50% of present (World Resources Report, 2019 ). Some research on certain seaweeds has centered around various extraction methods and the bioavailability of target nutrients, including proteins and peptides (Raja et al., 2022 ), but the topic is not especially well-studied compared to proteins from other crops. The unique cell-wall polysaccharides in macroalgae can hinder extraction processes by limiting the availability of protein molecules, but the potential to utilize seaweeds as a nutritional protein source is considered an important and viable option (Bleakley & Hayes, 2017 ; De Bhowmick & Hayes, 2022 ; Hayes, 2018 ). Tremblay and Beaulieu (2021)  describe five conventional extraction methods for proteins and peptides from macroalgae, and they discuss five emerging technologies. Some seaweeds are reported to have higher protein yields per unit growth area than traditional high-protein crops such as soybeans and pulses (2.5–7.5 tons ha−1  year−1  vs. 0.6–1.2 tons ha−1  year−1  and 1–2 tons ha−1  year−1 , respectively) (van Krimpen et al., 2013 , p. 10). Bioaccessibility and bioavailability aspects of food digestion also determine quality and therefore, the value of the protein source. There remains a limited understanding of dietary seaweeds and the transformations during the digestive processes, including details of the transport across the digestive epithelium, leading to difficulties in measuring bioactivities (Wells et al., 2016 ). Research on seaweeds and their components is now reaching new heights as their benefits to human health are becoming more widely recognized. With respect to protein content, Lüning (1990)  published a comprehensive review on the constituents of seaweeds, among numerous other considerations. In general, the fresh weight of seaweeds typically includes 75%–90% water (species dependent). Of the remaining dry weight, about 75% is organic matter, and the rest is mineral ash. Depending on the species and other influential factors such as seasonality, growing conditions, and postharvest treatment, the protein portion of the organic component can range from 10% to 44% (Pangestuti & Kim, 2015 ). Galland-Irmouli et al. (1999)  recorded protein content to an average 21.9% (dry weight) in the red alga Palmaria palmata  collected on the French Brittany coast during the winter and early spring. The protein content of P. palmata  harvested in May at Skjerstadfjorden, Bodø, Norway, was determined to be 25.6% in freeze-dried samples, but protein yields were greater (e.g., 54.9%) when the enzyme xylanase was used to hydrolyze the samples prior to analysis (Bjarnadóttir et al., 2018 ). A data table published in a review by Pangestuti and Kim (2015)  cites the protein content of no less than 25 red seaweeds, ranging from 0.9% (d.w.) for Gracilaria verrucosa  to 31.0% to 44.0% for Porphyra yezoensis . Also included in the list are 10 green seaweeds, ranging from 6.3% in Ulva fasciata  to 21% to 32% in U. compressa , and finally, 17 brown seaweeds, ranging from 3% to 14% in Fucus vesiculosus  to 5% to 16% in Saccharina latissima . Research such as this highlights the need for appropriate, species-specific standardization protocols to establish and manage expectations regarding protein levels in whole seaweeds and how these levels depend on species, location, and harvest time. The protein content in agricultural crops such as cereal grains can be manipulated or enriched by managing certain nutritional inputs. Similarly, on-land tank cultivation of P. palmata  with recirculating water or potentially IMTA operations (Queirós et al., 2021 ) are possible avenues by which the necessary protein-producing elements can be introduced and managed. Nitrogen and sulfur are essential for the production of protein, and while nitrogen must be acquired, almost all seaweeds contain within their cell walls a wide variety of sulfated polysaccharides. Furthermore, scheduling the time of harvest, i.e., springtime for dulse, or establishing a system of strain selection (i.e., as achieved with terrestrial plants, specific traits for the domestication of selected seaweed species) can lead to a higher protein content in the final product. Cultivation variables must also be carefully managed toward not only nutritional efficacy and environmental sustainability, but it is also necessary to have economic viability for the producers/growers as well (Andréfouët et al., 2021 ; Hussin & Khoso, 2021 ; Larson et al., 2020 ). IMTA approaches here may become an important factor, not least of all when aquaculture of seaweeds is combined with aquaculture of sustainable crops of bivalves. One of the challenges to alleviating hunger by utilizing seaweeds is the need to effectively consolidate the multitude of peer-reviewed data, as there are species and even cultivar differences, as well as differences according to season, geographical location/environment, and postharvest treatment. In addition, analytical testing procedures frequently vary among studies (Bleakley & Hayes, 2017 ; Cornish & Garbary, 2010 ; Wells et al., 2016 ), often making comparisons questionable across tests. A significant number of research studies have been carried out to provide  reliable information about seaweed constituents, but currently, nutritionists and formulators must rely on a range of nutrient concentrations for each species. This will invariably be the case unless the growing, harvesting, and processing systems are adequately standardized regionally, if not globally. As the seaweed industry continues to grow and evolve across the world, and methods of cultivation (phyconomy!) more closely reflect agricultural production in terms of management and control, nutritional components can thus be more readily standardized. Formulators and nutritionists will have the ability to then work with a reliable and consistent food source, which can then be optimally formulated or administered to help meet fundamental hunger and nutritional demands (Gellenbeck, 2012 ).  Fats Essential for several bodily functions and also critical as an energy substrate, fats are an important food component. Humans are unable to efficiently synthesize some of the most critical ones, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6, n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5, n-3). These must come directly from the diet. There are two primary groups of fats, i.e., saturated and unsaturated, and the ones that play the greatest positive role in overall human health are the unsaturated forms. Excess or prolonged intake of saturated fats has been shown by some researchers to increase the risk for heart disease, and their protracted ingestion contributes to a cluster of systemic abnormalities known as the “metabolic syndrome”, components of which clearly contribute to cardiovascular pathologies (Babio et al., 2012 ; Barona et al., 2012 ). Fats in the form of lipids and fatty acids constitute a significant proportion of the human brain. Approximately 60% of the dry weight of the human brain is lipid. A further 50% of these brain lipids contain essential fatty acids and their derivatives, and it is relevant to note that the fatty acid profile of the human brain is characterized by approximately equal proportions of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4, n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6, n-3), important members of the α-6 and α-3 pool (Mouritsen, 2005 ). Crucial to neurogenesis and cognition, these essential fatty acids must be supplied by the diet, and deficiencies can lead to, among other things, impairments in neurotransmission, photoreception, and prostaglandin production (Bazan et al., 2011 ; Simopoulos, 2008 ; Yehuda & Carasso, 1993 ). Pregnant women who are deficient in DHA are at high risk for metabolic, neurological, and physical impairments of the fetus, and these impairments can extend to the long-term development of the new individual. Human studies are frequently carried out on neonatal subjects because the most rapid brain growth commences in the midtrimester of fetal development and continues throughout the second year of life. There is a tenfold increase in brain size during this period, accompanied by an approximately 30-fold increase in DHA content and a 15-fold increase in AA (Al et al., 1990 , 1995 ; Birch et al., 2007 ; Clandinin et al., 1980 ; Ghys et al., 2002 ; Martinez & Mougan, 1998 ). Obviously, maternal nutritional status is critical to the development of the infant. While total fat content is relatively low in seaweeds, between 1% and 4% of their dry weight (Perez-Lloréns et al., 2018 ) it is present in a very important α-3 to α-6 fatty acid ratio similar to the composition of the animal brain, including humans. A third polyunsaturated, essential fatty acid, i.e., eicosapentaenoic (EPA:C20:5, n-3), also contributes to the cellular α-3 pool, which is important too, especially as α-6 consumption typically far exceeds α-3s in global diets, a fundamentally unhealthy situation (Mouritsen, 2005 ). PUFAs (α-3 and α-6) represent between 30% and 70% of the lipid content of some seaweeds. The α-6 PUFAs are precursors for the synthesis of vaso-constrictor molecules, while α-3 PUFAs have vaso-dilatory properties. This interesting dichotomy supports the wellness concept of “yin-yang ,” where eating the appropriate balance of these two types of fatty acids is considered to lower the risk of various diseases related to chronic tissue inflammation, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, colon cancer, etc. The α-3/α-6 ratio in seaweeds typically ranges between 0.3 and 1.8, which is very close to the ideal that is recommended by nutritionists, between 0.2 and 1.0 (Perez-Lloréns et al., 2018 ). In a study to evaluate total lipid and fatty acid content, Kumari et al. (2010)  analyzed 27 different macroalgal species and determined that the lipid content varied widely among them, e.g., 0.57% to 3.5% on a d.w. basis. In a more recent analysis, Soares et al. (2021)  determined the total lipid content (d.w.) in 10 different seaweed species harvested from the northern shore of Portugal, and these ranged from 0.7 ± 0.1% for Chondrus crispus  to 3.8 ± 0.6% for Ulva  spp. Fatty acid analysis of five red species and three brown seaweeds collected from two Portuguese seashores (Rocha et al., 2021 ) identified samples of the introduced fucoid Sargassum muticum  as being the most plentiful source of EPA, compared to the other seven seaweeds tested. While significantly more at 13.83 ± 0.48 mg g−1  than cooked salmon, which is 858 mg g−1  for an 85 g serving size (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2021 ), it is highly unlikely a serving size of dried Sargassum  would exceed 1 g. It is also unlikely that individuals, especially the poor, are able to consume salmon every week. However, two servings per week are required to meet the daily requirements for DHA and EPA (Kris-Etherton et al., 2009 ). A significant proportion of the global food supply is made up of barley, wheat, rice, and corn (Cohen & Armelagos, 1984 ),  none of which contain all of the EAA, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals critical for human health and survival. It is not unrealistic to displace some of these, especially mass-produced manufactured versions, by including carefully measured amounts of seaweed, ideally a blend of seaweeds, in the daily diet as an omega-3 (and other nutrient) supplement. A case where some, is better than none.  Carbohydrates Carbohydrates come in several different forms. Sugars are typically the simplest form of carbohydrates, whereas starch and fiber are complex carbohydrates. A vital source of fuel, dietary carbohydrates are broken down during digestion into simple monosaccharides, in particular, glucose, which enters the bloodstream and becomes the energy source necessary for brain function and other metabolic activities. Excess monosaccharides not required for immediate energy use are converted to the storage polysaccharide, glycogen, deposited most commonly in the liver and muscle cells of humans. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) jointly recommend that humans obtain 55% to 75% of their total energy supply from carbohydrates, but no more than 10% from simple sugars. Under conditions of prolonged hunger, however, if blood glucose levels cannot be maintained above 2.2 mM (40 mg dL−1 ), sufficient glucose is unavailable to fuel the brain, the red blood cells, or other tissues, all of which are absolutely dependent on this carbohydrate (Benton et al., 1996 ). The fiber forms of carbohydrates in seaweeds constitute both a soluble component and an insoluble, or more accurately, a nondigestible, fermentable component. Soluble fibers from seaweeds form viscous gels when they come into contact with water, whereas the insoluble fibers retain water, are more resistant to digestion, and increase fecal biomass (Elleuch et al., 2011 ; Peñalver et al., 2020 ). These two types of seaweed fibers are classified based upon their function, either as storage polysaccharides such as laminarin and floridean starch or as cell wall structural components, such as agars, alginates, carrageenans, fucoidans, galactans, xylans, and ulvans (Hentati et al., 2020 ). Both types of fiber potentially interact with the gut microbiota, which is known to play very important roles in human health and disease (Cornish et al., 2019 ; Gomez-Zavaglia et al., 2019 ; Tuohy et al., 2012 ). In addition, seaweed fibers (polysaccharides) can be further described as nonsulfated and sulfated forms, the latter being particularly unique to marine macroalgae (Gullón et al., 2020 ). Seaweeds are already commercially utilized for their carbohydrate components, e.g., complex polysaccharides such as alginates from brown seaweeds and carrageenans and agars from red seaweeds. These nonstarch sugars can range, on a dry weight basis, in the green seaweeds from 33% in Caulerpa longata  to 67% in Codium fragile . In the brown macroalgae, the range of nonsugars can go from 30.6% in Sargassum fusiforme  to 61% in Himanthalia longata , and in the reds, carbohydrate content can vary from 43% in Pyropia umbilicalis  to 68% in Chondrus crispus  (Pereira, 2011 ). These edible carbohydrate polymers from seaweeds can directly interact with gut microbes and lead to the production of beneficial metabolites such as various short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). By functioning as prebiotics, they confer favorable health benefits on the host, which include maintaining metabolic homeostasis, ameliorating inflammation, and enhancing the ratio of health-promoting microbes to health-adverse microbes (Holscher, 2017 ). Indeed, various seaweed-derived dietary fibers have been shown to provide multiple beneficial properties, including anticoagulant, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and antiviral activities (Tanna & Mishra, 2019 ). Several recent reviews were published, highlighting the considerable body of scientific research regarding the influence of seaweed components on the gut microbiota (Cornish et al., 2019 ). For extensive detail on species, extraction methods, models used, metabolites produced, and effects, please refer to Huang et al. (2022)  or Shannon et al. (2021) . A large percentage of people in the West do not manage to take in the recommended daily dose of fiber, which is about 25 g day−1 , so a minimum daily portion of dried seaweed (an Asian adult typically consumes 8 g) would provide about 13% of their daily fiber requirement. In addition, algal polysaccharides are an excellent gluten substitute thanks to their complex structure. Approximately 1% of the world's population are coeliacs; therefore, the growing demand for gluten-free products argues well for a promising future for products obtained from seaweed-derived dietary constituents (Perez-Lloréns et al., 2018 ).  Improved nutrition It is unrealistic to suggest that any one resource could end global hunger, but the more nutritionally dense a food is, the larger the impact it can have. Seaweeds are, indeed, nutritionally dense, collectively containing all the elements necessary to support and sustain the life of Homo sapiens , but (and there's always a but), it bears repeating, there is one exception, i.e., calories in the form of an adequate amount of fat and digestible carbohydrates (Crawford, 1992 ; Martinez & Mougan, 1998 ; Mouritsen, 2005 ). In addition to protein and carbohydrate content, and an optimal essential fatty acid balance, the remaining nutritional possibilities of seaweeds are extensive (Lorenzo et al., 2017 ; Mantanjun et al., 2009 ; Pereira, 2011 ; Pomin, 2012 ). The mineral and trace-element contents of samples of Fucus vesiculosus , Laminaria digitata , Undaria pinnatifida ,  Chondrus crispus , and Porphyra tenera  were determined to be more than adequate to meet nutritional demands, even as relative proportions varied among the species examined (Rupérez et al., 2002 ). Using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, Rupérez, in 2002, reported that those seaweeds ranged from 8000 to 17,900 mg/100 g of the macro-minerals, e.g., Na, K, Ca, and Mg, and they had trace element contents of iron, zinc, manganese, and copper ranging from 5 to 15 mg/100 g. Twenty years later, the pool of scientific research on the various minerals, trace elements, and bioactive molecules found in seaweeds has increased significantly, and more recent examples maintain the feasibility of selectively utilizing seaweeds as nutritional supplements in the human diet (Blikra et al., 2021 ; Crowley et al., 2018 ; Tibbetts et al., 2016 ). Parjikolaei et al. (2016)  analyzed nine species of red macroalgae from Danish waters and compared their mineral and trace element contents to that of a fresh-weight serving of fruits and vegetables. The recommended dietary intake for adults in mg day−1  of minerals and trace metals is included in their research, and the comparisons are interesting. Mineral levels were met or exceeded by at least one member, but usually, more, of the nine seaweed species tested compared to the fruit and vegetable serving, listed as follows: manganese (139.2 mg/100 g vs. 0.02–0.66 mg/100 g), selenium (62 μg/100 g vs. 0.1–60 μg/100 g), zinc (11.2 mg/100 g vs. 0.05–11.8 mg/100 g), magnesium (1265 mg/100 g vs. 5.5–191 mg/100 g), iron (80.1 mg 100 g vs. 0.13–3.01 mg/100 g), calcium (5398 mg/100 g vs. 8.7–600 mg/100 g), and especially high levels of potassium and sodium in the seaweeds compared to the vegetables and fruit. Seaweed values are based on dry weight, and vegetable and fruits, were measured fresh. There is no question that iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, and it is a critical element for healthy, neurological brain development in the fetus in the womb and beyond. Of utmost importance is an adequate and consistent supply of dietary iodine for pregnant and breastfeeding women, as brain development begins in utero and continues for the first few years after birth (Prado & Dewey, 2014 ). The recommended intake for this particular group of women is 220 to 290 μg day−1  (Otten et al., 2006 ; WHO, 2002 , 2007a , 2007b ), which is higher than for other adults, and while some countries have implemented iodine-fortified foods, such as iodized table salt, the WHO (2007a, 2007b)  estimated that in 2004, two billion people around the world were at risk of iodine deficiency. However, since that time, national government-endorsed iodized salt programs have almost doubled the number of countries with mandated salt iodization programs, from 67 in 2003 to 118 in 2020. There are still countries with populations that are iodine deficient, and there remain some inequities related to that issue, particularly between the wealthy and the poorest people (Zimmerman & Andersson, 2021 ). These national iodized salt programs must be continued to help ensure adequate iodine levels in global populations, but there are also increasing efforts to reduce salt intake for other health-related reasons such as hypertension and heart disease. Utilizing seaweeds to counter iodine deficiencies can be a safe, natural, and effective approach, but to do so requires initiative, desire, and management. In a study comparing potassium iodide (KI) with low-level inputs of brown seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum ) supplementation to 42 healthy but iodine-deficient women, Combet et al. (2014)  were able to conclude that, with adequate analytical testing, the inclusion of seaweeds in staple foods can serve as an effective alternative to fortification with KI as a proactive means to combat iodine deficiency. While their research suggested only modest iodine bioavailability from the commercial A. nodosum  samples, as compared to KI, they determined that daily ingestion of 0.5 g of the seaweed for 2 weeks significantly increased urinary iodine excretion and the concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone from 1.5 (IQR 1.2–2.2) to 2.1 (IQR 1.3–2.9). The iodine content in some brown seaweeds is high, especially in some Fucales (wracks) and Laminariales (kelps, kombu ). The recommended daily intake of iodine is about 0.15 mg, although a healthy person who does not suffer from any thyroid problems can take several milligrams without any problem. However, on rare occasions, an excess of iodine may cause imbalances in the thyroid gland, thereby potentially affecting the production of hormones that control metabolism. Iodine intake can be reduced depending on the way the meal is prepared, but further research is needed on how iodine bioavailability is altered depending both on the form of food processing and the seaweed species (Perez-Lloréns et al., 2018 ). Vitamins are essential organic nutrients, and they must be obtained from the diet, as humans cannot efficiently or directly synthesize them. Wells et al. (2016)  reviewed comparisons between the vitamin content of a range of seaweeds and some conventional food sources. The authors concluded their thoroughly detailed research review by stating with certainty that algal foods can be an excellent source for a wide range of these essential micronutrients. For example, vitamin A, derived from the carotenoid β-carotene, is critical for eye health and vision, for maintaining a healthy immune system, for growth and development, and for reproduction. Vitamin A supports many systems in the body, and analyses of nine wild red seaweed species by Parjikolaei et al. (2016)  indicated a higher level of β-carotene in dulse, the common red alga Palmaria palmata  (420 mg kg−1  d.m.) in summer,  compared to the concentration in winter samples (37 mg kg−1  d.m.), another reminder that seasonality will impact nutrient standardization efforts for seaweeds. From a nutritional perspective, maternal health can benefit greatly by the judicious utilization of a variety of seaweeds (evaluated so far). Algae are also rich sources of vitamins, including B12  (Grossman, 2016 ), which are intrinsically associated with factors impacting critical aspects of brain development, including altered cerebral blood flow, compromised cognition control, and language function in humans. Newborn infants experiencing a diet devoid of B12  are most susceptible to deficiencies since their body stores, estimated to be about 25 μg, are utilized at approximately 0.1 μg day −1  for tissue synthesis during their first month of life. By extrapolation, without replenishment, this endogenous B12  would last about 8 months. However, the situation is more precarious if the mother is also deficient in B12  (Bourre, 2006 ; von Schenck et al., 1997 ). Typical symptoms indicative of infantile vitamin B12  deficiency are cerebral and optic nerve atrophy, apathy and subsequent coma, hypotonia, and developmental delay (Roumeliotis et al., 2012 ; Stabler, 2013 ). Pyropia  spp. (commonly called nori) are considered one of the better seaweed sources of Vitamin B12  (Marques de Brito et al., 2022 ; Watanabe et al., 2014 ), although some scientists still question this claim as techniques for measuring and understanding B12  and its analogue version are not yet fully mature. Research on B12  content and bioavailability in two different macroalgae, Ulva  sp., a green (Chlorophyta), and Pyropia  sp., a red (Rhodophyta), resulted in the authors concluding that the seaweeds tested could provide a substantial, bioavailable supply of B12  (Watanabe et al., 1996 ). The average B12  amount was 66.39 μg/100 g d.w. for the Ulva  and 28.66 μg/100 g d.w. for Pyropia , but the caveat is that 100 dry grams of either of these species are much more than a serving size. However, in lesser amounts, they could potentially contribute to the maintenance supply of B12  as well as other vitamins, once deficiency levels have been rectified in the individual. B12  is known to be synthesized by certain bacteria, and these bacteria, in turn, can have mutualistic or symbiotic relationships with a particular seaweed species. If investment in research can feasibly allocate significant support for methane reduction from the global bovine population, investment in finding ways to improve human health and wellbeing must also be feasible. It is not impossible to innovate with a mind to making accessible a natural and consistent dietary source of the essential B vitamins, including B12 , among other nutrients, to provide broad health benefits to humans. This points to, for example, “Vitamin B12  enriched pasta” or similar modified foods. These could be prepared in hospitals and care facilities where diets are often nutritionally challenging, especially for seniors. Appetites are typically reduced in senior populations, and foods need to be nutrient dense and widely appealing. Surely the technology exists. Also associated with UN SDG 2 is the obvious necessity for global food production to follow criteria surrounding aspects of sustainable agriculture and aquaculture. Again, seaweeds, to some extent, are already contributing to sustainable agricultural practices, as they have for centuries, as soil amendments, fertilizers, biostimulants, and feed supplements. Refinements in animal feed and nutrition science and the widespread development of algal extracts and their diverse applications are all avenues where seaweeds provide agricultural benefits while contributing to the development of virtuous circular economies (Bleakley & Hayes, 2017 ; Elansary et al., 2016 ; Garcia-Vaquero, 2019 ; Rajauria et al., 2015 ; Sweeney et al., 2016 ; Tayyab et al., 2016 ). However, one of the most ethical and effective mitigation strategies in the effort to reduce GHG emissions in the food chain is to actively provide an alternative source of food and, in doing so, minimize current intensive production activities, particularly animal (red meat) agriculture (Garnett, 2011 ). Farming seaweeds for food on a scale significant enough to displace intensively farmed crops can minimize the GHG emissions from land clearing (deforestation), pre and post-production processes, and farm-related energy costs. From a human nutritional perspective, a bit of history regarding humanity's transition to agriculture may offer some reassurance regarding current dietary resources. The consensus among archaeologists places the advent of early agricultural practices, such as the domestication of plants and animals, at approximately 10,000–12,000 years before the present (Gupta, 2004 ; Riehl et al., 2003 ). The transition to agriculture ultimately led to significant changes in diet after countless millennia of foraging for fruit, berries, roots, wild vegetation, and other edibles, including seaweeds, and then eventually the hunting of game. It is noteworthy that agriculture became a practice aimed at food production centuries after that era when crucial human brain development is considered to have occurred, i.e., 2.5 to 2.0 mya (Cunnane & Crawford, 2014 ; Kyriacou et al., 2014 ; Marean, 2014 ). Homid populations by this time consisted of larger family groups who had the cognitive capacity to communicate and cooperate with one another, to hunt, and to make rudimentary tools (Elton, 2008 ). As groups of hunter-gatherers switched to farming, they ultimately traded quality for quantity, and the earliest crops grown were carbohydrate-rich barley, wheat, rice, and corn (Cohen & Armelagos, 1984 ), which are unable to provide all the EAA or vitamins necessary for human health and survival. These crops are still farmed extensively today (USDA, 2020 ), and they make up a significant proportion of global feed and food supplies. Marine macroalgae can provide much-needed dietary diversity and subsequent improved health and nutrition while simultaneously helping  to repair our planet; indeed, Ulva  spp. have been described as “marine wheat”. Aside from becoming a widespread source of protein, fiber, minerals, vitamins, and beneficial bioactive compounds for humans, seaweeds can also contribute to improving the sustainability of agricultural production, as mentioned previously. Some examples include, in farm animals, a reduction in heat stress (Borzouie et al., 2020 ; de Lima et al., 2019 ; Ellamie et al., 2020 ), enhanced immunity (Corino et al., 2019 ; Saker et al., 2004 ; Shimazu et al., 2019 ), improved growth performance (Kulshreshtha et al., 2014 ; Martinez et al., 2019 ), and methane reduction (Maia et al., 2016 ; Molina-Alcaide et al., 2017 ; Roque et al., 2019 ). There currently exists an extensive accumulation of research around the benefits of seaweed extracts in applications on various food crops, and a thoroughly researched overview on this topic by Stirk et al. (2020)  offers considerable insight regarding the progress to date. Seaweeds and their extracts have been shown to enhance crop yield and quality (Abdel-Mawgoud et al., 2010 ; Ali et al., 2016 ; Karthikeyan & Shanmugam, 2017 ), fruit set (Ali et al., 2021 ), growth performance (Graziani et al., 2022 ), drought resistance (Irani et al., 2021 ), shelf-life (Miceli et al., 2021 ), pest resistance (Borlongan et al., 2011 ), soil microbial health (Trivedi et al., 2021 ), and stress resistance in plants, naturally (Van Oosten et al., 2017 ). While there are environmental and financial processing costs associated with the production of macroalgal extracts, careful research is necessary to ensure the anticipated trade-offs are positive. Seaweeds can surely help facilitate a better role for agriculture in the circular marine/terrestrial economy and, in doing so, ameliorate some of the negative impacts our global food production system currently delivers. It remains unclear at this time, but humans, as secondary consumers, may potentially receive protective effects from the consumption of crops produced with the utilization of various seaweed-derived products. Methods developed to fortify terrestrial crops with mineral elements often lacking in human diets, such as iron, zinc, copper, calcium, magnesium, and iodine, must use strategies such as genetic modification and/or the addition of inorganic fertilizers (White & Broadley, 2009 ). Seaweeds readily contain all of these mineral elements and theoretically could be used in biofortification efforts as well, although research in this area lags behind other approaches, such as plant breeding. Fan et al. (2011)  showed that an extract from the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum  enhanced the antioxidant content in spinach. The spinach, in turn, when prepared as a feed, was shown to protect the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans  against oxidative and thermal stresses. Ascophyllum nodosum  was also shown, when included in the diets of milking cows, to increase the iodine content of their milk. In addition, their gut microbial populations were altered in favor of increased beneficial microbes (Firmicutes), with a concomitant decrease in the number of Proteobacteria (Lopez et al., 2016 ). Laying hens with a 10% portion of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera  added to their diet increased the n-3 fatty acid content of eggs beyond that provided by sardine oil, improving lipid composition and consumer acceptance (Carrillo et al., 2008 ). It is commonly understood that cold-water fish and shellfish that feed on (micro)algae are a reliable food source for the important PUFAs arachidonic (AA:20:4, n-6), and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA:C22:6, n-3), which are essential for human health and development. Humans are compelled to obtain these fatty acids from their diets, as do fish and shellfish, by herbivorously grazing upon and consuming the (micro or macro) algae that contain them. These are examples of nutritional benefits becoming available as they advance “up” various trophic levels of the food chain from primary to secondary consumers as a result of utilizing and concentrating components of the micro/macroalgae. This will be a critically important area for future research.  Good health and well-being for all! UN SDG Goal 3 : “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” A goal to ensure healthy lives contains many facets, and the 2021 UN progress report, https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3 , provides data showing improvements in the global maternal mortality ratio and preventable deaths of infants and children under the age of 5, although it is expected the COVID-19 pandemic will have negatively affected this improvement. Nutrition will always play a significant role in women's health, especially before, during, and after pregnancy. Ideally, healthy human lives should be free of chronic nutritional imbalances that trigger inflammatory responses and, in turn, lead to the manifestation of noncommunicable diseases such as atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, obesity, and diabetes (Cornish et al., 2015 ; Weiss, 2008 ; Wu & Schauss, 2012 ). Aside from the communicable spread of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of death globally. In 2019, an estimated 32% of global deaths, i.e., approximately 17.9 million people, died from CVDs (WHO, 2021 , https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds) ). While balanced nutrition plays an important role in ameliorating the risk factors associated with cardiovascular health, it is prudent to acknowledge the influences of gender inequalities, parental education, the physical and social environment, as  well as socioeconomic indices. The situation is acknowledged as complicated to resolve, but reliable and affordable availability of nutrient-dense foods, or food ingredients, can help address food insecurity issues (Pabayo et al., 2012 ; Vereecken & Maes, 2010 ; Wells et al., 2012 ). Quality of life relies on good health, and society's global diet needs adjustment in many different ways. Beyond nutrition, seaweeds can offer protective effects against reactive oxygen species (ROS) by nature of their high antioxidant capacity, an artifact of life and longevity in the ocean, and at the interface with the land. In simplest terms, an antioxidant may be considered an agent that delays, prevents, or removes oxidative damage from a target molecule (Halliwell & Gutteridge, 2007 , p. 851). The list of antioxidant compounds collectively found in seaweeds is extensive, but they can be placed into the following, more general categories: carotenoids, phenolic compounds, phycobilin pigments, polyphenols, sulfated polysaccharides, and vitamins (Cornish & Garbary, 2010 ). Foods rich in antioxidants have long been seen as aids in disease prevention against a wide range of pathologies and deleterious clinical conditions, triggered by chronic ROS production. Collectively, the wide range of beneficial biological activities associated with the antioxidative ingredients derived from seaweeds has the potential to expand their health value not only in the food industry but also in the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries (Li & Kim, 2011 ; Lobine et al., 2021 ). Well-being is defined as “a state of positivity with a sense of meeting full potential at all physiological levels” (Simmons & Baldwin, 2021 ). What does that mean? In the context of food, assurances of availability, affordability, acceptability (sensory characteristics), and most importantly, the nutritional benefit would be an answer, each a potentially complicated undertaking in itself. A sense of ownership and self-sufficiency with a source of income leads to healthy and productive families for so many of those who take the opportunity to be seaweed farmers (Larson et al., 2020 ; Rimmer et al., 2021 ). Management is key, but there are solutions in the seaweed.  Discussion The tremendous potential for various seaweeds to help protect against the manifestation of various noncommunicable diseases requires significantly more evidence-based studies, and ultimately, these studies need to include human (clinical) trials. A considerable breadth and depth of literature currently exists regarding the nutritional and functional food benefits (nutraceutical) to be realized from various seaweeds, but the ability to influence international, governmental policies will require many more relevant and targeted studies. For example, should a government mandate regarding specific inclusion rates of a particular seaweed to meet a specific nutritional need be considered, such as mineral-enriched breads or pastas via cultivated red seaweed? Care and consideration must be given to the particular species, seasonality, culture conditions, security of supply, and postharvest treatment as an initial step, but it is feasible to fortify manufactured foods with seaweeds. Proof of efficacy is then essential before proponents can adequately influence policymakers to act on viable seaweed-based solutions. Merely making the research available, however, is not enough to motivate the policy audience and decision-makers to make use of the evidence. Trusted relationships must be developed at all levels, as well as a deep knowledge of the issues and policy systems, especially at the regional and national levels; familiarity with the key players involved and an ability to speak the language of the community all influence engagement and decision-making. One also has to consider, in a case where beneficial seaweed is required for inclusion in commodity-based foods such as bread and pasta, whether the volumes required would be far beyond any seaweed crop currently harvested and/or cultivated. Notwithstanding a tremendous amount of supportive information on the human health benefits of seaweed consumption and applications in international, peer-reviewed journals, as well as voluminous amounts of unrefereed claims and hyperbole in the popular press, there remain some roadblocks in terms of the global usage of seaweeds for human nutrition. These are not insurmountable, but distinctions need also to be made between seaweed extracts and whole seaweeds per se. The direct daily intake of whole seaweeds must be carefully administered, as the issue of variability both within and among them can lead to overconsumption of potentially toxic elements, such as iodine or heavy metals. Polysaccharide degradation processes that are made to produce, by overhydrolysis, low molecular weight oligo-carrageenans, or poligenes, can lead to health concerns in humans. Awareness and caution are warranted (Aakre et al., 2021 ; Cotas et al., 2021 ). Seaweed cultivation (phyconomy) is a viable management strategy to avoid some of these potential health concerns and produce more homogenous raw materials. While the extensive extractive capabilities of seaweeds are useful from an environmental circular economy perspective, they may not be so beneficial in relation to human consumption. Beyond providing some equalization between supply and demand, the inconsistencies in nutritional content of seaweeds based upon species, geographic location, seasonality, and other environmental influences present multiple needs for potentially complicated management strategies. These must be chosen in order to achieve a measure of standardization and optimisation for maximal benefits. Perhaps even more challenging, as already mentioned briefly in this review, are the difficulties  associated with understanding the bioavailability of foods in general and of seaweeds in particular. Bioavailability refers to the fraction of nutritional or functional components that actually elicit an effect in relation to their residence time in the digestive system. It presumes their prior release from the food matrix and their transformations during digestion. These effects can be realized via translocation across the small intestinal epithelial cells into the blood, and by direct interactions with the digestive epithelia, by altering the uptake of other substances, by regulating the microbial gut consortia (and release of beneficial SCFAs in the hind gut, Wells et al., 2016 ). Much is already known about the influences of various postharvest treatments and the different food processes on nutrient bioavailability in agricultural crops (Gharibzahedi & Jafari, 2017 ), but scarce resources have been spent to date on studying any algae for global benefit in this respect. Most of the science and published literature highlighting the health and nutritional benefits of algae (micro and macro) is based upon in vitro cell cultures, small animal studies, and historical anecdotes. Investments in human clinical trials and advanced analytical techniques can lead to significant returns with respect to global hunger, nutrition, and food security, thereby more than adequately playing significant roles in addressing UN SDGs. Progress in this area has been slow. This is, in part, a function of the fragmentation of human resources, leading to a fundamental information gap between phycologists/phyconomists, the academics who undertake the research, and the food developers and technologists employed by the large corporate engines most responsible for global food manufacturing. Regulatory issues exist in various countries, and they are complicated and challenging to sort out. Poor consumer acceptance is touted as another factor regarding the reluctance of seaweeds in becoming universally common foodstuffs and ingredients. However, this remains to be seen. Finding as many as possible avenues through which to mandate the handful of multinational companies in control of producing and distributing the world's processed foods is a daunting consideration. However, time is of the essence. A directive to utilize single or blends of seaweeds as ingredients in certain products based upon their health and nutritional benefits would mean that the need for extensive consumer education becomes moot and the seaweed would become an accepted nutritional food. However, this will allow for more research into cultivation activities, although there is a bit of a chicken and egg aspect with that. Applied algal research has to focus on this very obvious opportunity to help combat global nutrition issues, food security, agricultural sustainability, and quality of life for all. If this does not take root within the very near future (i.e., 5–10 years), then the opportunity may well be lost, along with the ability to provide new tools to adequately feed the world's population.
