They cover a range of social, economic, and environmental outcomes, with central aims of equity and reaching those most vulnerable (United Nations Development Group, 2017 ). Children and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are a particularly disadvantaged group, as they tend to be exposed to high levels of inequality, poverty and violence, alongside poor access to services and a limited health and welfare infrastructure (United Nations Development Programme, 2014 ). However, it has been suggested that these young people could generate an annual dividend of at least 500 billion USD over the coming 30 years if invested in (Gupta et al., 2014 ). Further research is needed to effectively guide such investments and associated policy decisions. To improve wordwide achievement of the SDGs, the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) has called for an identification of so-called “accelerators”: interventions, services or programatic areas that are evidence-based, scalable and, importantly, target multiple SDGs at once and in more depth than any single provision, thus using limited available resources as efficiently as possible (Cluver et al., 2019 ). This stands in contrast to the currently prevalent silo designs, where one intervention or standalone programme targets a single outcome (e.g. Adato & Bassett, 2019; Baird et al., 2013 ). The UNDP SDG Accelerator and Bottleneck Assessment (UNDP, 2017) further elaborates on this, distinguishing between accelerators as development policies and/or programme areas that directly influence SDG outcomes (e.g., real-world protective factors such as food security, high-quality education and good parenting) and interventions (such as feeding programs, free schooling, parenting interventions) that can drive progress on these accelerators. With few prospective studies available, analysis of already existing datasets – while potentially limited in their generalizability – allows deriving initial knowledege on what combined provisions of protective factors could yield the strongest improvements in child and adolescent outcomes, with a key next step being to identify effective interventions and policies that change access to these accelerating factors. In accordance with the above-outlined theoretical considerations, research using siloed approaches provides a range of evidence for single factors that could positively influence SDG-related outcomes, including cash transfers, food security, positive parenting, and safety from violence (Bastagli et al., 2016; Devlin, Wight, & Fenton, 2018; Fowler et al., 2009; Shankar, Chung, & Frank, 2017; Wright, Austin, Booth, & Kliewer, 2017 ). However, supporting the accelerator concept, recent studies have highlighted the beneficial effects of being exposed to multiple protective factors in parallel on child and adolescent development. For instance, combined exposure to cash grant provisions and positive parenting was associated with a lower HIV risk in adolescents aged 10–18 years (Cluver et al., 2014 ) and better cognitive and educational outcomes in children and adolescents aged 4–13 years (Sherr et al., 2017 ) than cash grant provisions alone. A prioneering analysis tested the idea of accelerators more broadly in a sample of South African adolescents aged 10–19 years. The authors identified three protective factors that were associated with improvements on three or more of the 11 studied SDG-related outcomes, thus being defined as “accelerators”: parenting support, government cash transfers and psychosocial support (Cluver et al., 2019 ). For five out of the 11 targets, the accelerators also showed additive effects, i.e. their combinations exerted larger effects than each factor on its own. Similarly promising findings come from a study identifying positive parenting, parental monitoring and food security as potential accelerators for violence prevention (Cluver et al., 2020 ). This growing body of research now needs further evidence to extend our understanding of potential protective factors across different contexts and populations to reliably guide policy decisions. The need to exploit additive effects may also be particularly urgent given the proposed long-term social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may further limit budgets and resources available, while increasing the support needs of those most vulnerable. The current study widens the scope of the existing accelerator research in two main ways: firstly, it focuses on children and adolescents aged 9–13 years, and thus a somewhat younger age group than previous studies. Early adolescence has been proposed to be a key point of biological, social, and emotional change (McGuire et al., 2019 ); thus, it may be particularly important to understand what protective factors support positive development during this period. Secondly, one of the potential protective factors investigated in the current study is attendance of community-based organisations (CBOs). CBOs are often under-studied, but have been shown to be a delivery platform that is able to reach the most vulnerable children and their families (Sherr et al., 2016 ), by offering services such as parenting programmes, physical and mental health care and support with accessing social provisions (e.g. cash grants). They thus could pose key vehicles for supporting the achievement of the SDGs. The current analyses combine longitudinal data from two linked South African studies with baseline data collected between 2009 and 2011 and a 12–18 month follow up. The aim was to investigate 1) which of seven potentially protective factors (caregiver praise, caregiver monitoring, CBO access, healthcare access, receipt of a social grant, food security, living in a safe community) may be linked to three or more of 14 SDG-related outcomes, thereby acting as accelerators; and 2) whether combinations of these factors show additive effects, thus exceeding the positive impacts of any single factor alone.  2 Methods 2.1 Sample and procedure We pooled data from two prospective longitudinal studies (see Fig. 1  ), which were designed in close collaboration and made use of similar measures: The Child Community Care (CCC) study ( N  = 989)  evaluated the effects of CBO service provisions on outcomes in HIV/AIDs affected children aged 4–13 across three Southern African countries. To create a representative sample, 24 CBOs were randomly selected from a list of all projects funded by 11 organizations, stratified by funder and location. Consecutive attenders, up to a maximum of 40 children, were selected from each CBO. Data were collected at two time-points, during a baseline assessment in 2011/12 (uptake: 99%) and at a follow-up 12–15 months later (retention: 86%). Interviews were conducted by trained data collectors either in English or in relevant local languages, including Zulu, Xhosa and Chewa, and then translated back to English for analyses. The “Young Carers” (YC) study ( N  = 3515)  investigated well-being in children and adolescents from two urban and two rural districts strongly affected by HIV/AIDS (>30%) in two South African provinces. For each district, census enumeration areas were randomly selected. Then, all households in these areas were visited, and one child aged 9–17 was randomly chosen from each household to participate. Baseline data (T1) were collected in 2009/2010 (uptake: 97.5%), with a follow-up (T2) one year later (retention: 96.8%). Interviews were about 1 hour long, and were completed in the participant’s language of choice, including Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho, and Shangaan. For the current analyses, a subset of children and adolescents in the overlapping age range between both studies (9–13 years) and living in South Africa only were selected to enable comparability of sub-samples (see Fig. 1 ). Those excluded from analyses based on these criteria did not differ in terms of sex and province of origin; further meaningful comparisons are difficult given age differences for the included and excluded groups, which may drive any differences found (excluded: children aged 4–8 years for the CCC, adolescents aged 14–17 years for the YC study). To control for CBO provision, only those children/adolescents without any CBO attendance at both time-points were included from the YC study. A total of 446 children and adolescents from the CCC study and 1402 from the YC study met inclusion criteria (baseline: N  = 1848; follow-up: N  = 1740–92.4%). For both studies, children and their current caretakers provided informed consent and did not receive any incentives for participation, except for snacks and certificates of participation. In cases of emergency (reports of rape, abuse, suicidality or any other indication of harm), protocols were in place and participants were referred to specialized services for support. Ethical approvals were obtained from the Universities of Oxford (SSD/CUREC2/11-40) and Cape Town (Ref: CSSR 389/2009), respective provincial Health and Education Departments, University College London (1478/002), Stellenbosch University (N10/04/112), and CBO funding agencies. Data access is available upon application to the senior authors, given the sensitive nature of the data  2.2 Measures Full details on coding decisions and measures used are presented in Supplementary Materials 1 and 2 . SDG-Related Outcome Measures.  An interrogation of the measures available resulted in 14 outcomes being identified that aligned with five SDGs (see Supplementary Material 1  for definitions, measures and cut-offs used): no major depression (MDD), no post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and no suicidality, as well as overall good mental health (combined score of all three previous measures), no peer problems, high prosocial behaviour (all SDG 3.4); no substance abuse (SDG 3.5); school enrolment, school attendance, being in the right grade for age, being able to concentrate at school (all SDG 4.1/ 4.4); no sexual debut (given that the target population was relatively young) (SDG 5.6); no delinquent behaviours, and no exposure to physical and emotional abuse by the caregiver (SDG 16.1 and 16.2). Measures taken at follow-up were chosen as the primary outcome variables. However, we controlled for baseline scores, to account for potential pre-existing differences between the two sub-samples. Exceptions were the SDQ subscales and early sexual debut, for which measures were only available at T2. Accelerating protective factors.  Seven potential protective factors that may influence SDG-related outcomes were identified (see below). Since previous evidence has suggested that sustained and predictable access is required for protective factors to be effective (Cluver et al., 2019 ), provisions had to be received across both baseline and follow-up to be counted as “present”. The exception was cash grant receipt, for which a measure was only available at follow-up. The hypothesized protective factors comprised: 1) food security , coded as present if the child had not gone to bed hungry recently, 2) receipt of at least one of five government-provided cash grants  over the past year in the household the child lived in, 3) living in a safe community , with children not witnessing or directly being exposed to community violence, 4) consistent access to healthcare  when needed, 5) regular caregiver praise , 6) consistent caregiver monitoring  of child activities and 7) access to CBOs , with the YC sub-sample specifically chosen to not have access to CBOs at any time-point, thus posing a comparison group to the CCC sub-sample. Covariates.  Covariates were measured at baseline and comprised three sociodemographic factors (child age and sex, and whether the child lived in formal versus informal housing; all items taken from the South African Census in 2001; Statistics South Africa, 2001 ), two caretaker-related variables (maternal/paternal death and caregiver self-reported HIV status; Statistics South Africa, 2001 ), and two items indicating child caregiving responsibilities (Snider & Dawes, 2006 ). The latter two items were included since previous analyses found significant differences in levels of caregiving between the YC and CCC samples (Yakubovich et al., 2016 ).  2.3 Analyses Analyses were conducted in Stata SE v.16 (StataCorp., 2019 ) and comprised seven steps, following a standardized approach used in previous papers (Rudgard et al., 2020 ): First, we determined frequency distributions for all SDG-related outcomes, hypothesized protective factors and covariates at baseline and follow-up. We also investigated potential differences between the sub-sample that had dropped out by follow-up and participants retained across both time-points using χ2  and t-tests as appropriate. Second, we calculated tetrachoric correlations between the seven hypothesized protective factors to gain a better understanding of their associations with each other. Third, we calculated univariate associations between the hypothesized protective factors and all outcome variables to gain an initial impression of their inter-relationships. Fourth, we conducted path analyses, consisting of separate multivariable logistic regressions, with each of the 14 outcome variables being simultaneously regressed on all hypothesized protective factors and covariates. Fifth, to account for the risk of type 1 error resulting from multiple hypothesis testing, we adjusted the p-values through a Benjamini-Hochberg correction with a false discovery rate of 0.1. Since the seven hypothesized protective factors were included as predictors in all regression models, each was defined as comprising one family of tests. Sixth, hypothesized protective factors that were significantly associated with three or more outcomes following corrections were defined as potential “accelerators”. In a final step, adjusted probabilities and probability ratios for experiencing each outcome were calculated for three scenarios: 1) not being exposed to any of the potential accelerators determined in step 6, 2) being exposed to one of the accelerators and 3) experiencing all five accelerators in combination (Cluver et al., 2019 ). Of note, inter-correlations between the different outcome variables were found to be low to medium-sized (<0.3–0.4 for most), suggesting that analyses should be sufficiently reliable without accounting for inter-correlation of outcomes (Teixeira-Pinto & Normand, 2009 ).   3 Results 3.1 Descriptive information Frequency distributions for all SDG-related outcomes, proposed protective factors and control variables at baseline and follow-up are provided in Table 1  . Those lost to follow-up (n  = 108) were on average younger, more likely to have had at least one parent die, and to be a caretaker of younger children at baseline (see Table 1 ). They were also more likely to have been able to access healthcare when needed. No other group differences were found. Of the sample retained, 54.9% were female, with an average age of 11.5 years at baseline and 12.7 years at follow-up (for details, see Table 2  ). Missing data were overall low (<=2% for all variables), except for measures of sexual debut at T2, with n  = 222 missing (12.8%), potentially due to this being a sensitive question, or the young age of the group. Presence of SDG-related outcomes at follow-up ranged from 32.9% for “no peer problems” to 98.3% for “being enrolled in school”. Protective factor access rates across both T1 and T2 lay at 22.0% (n  = 383) for being enrolled in a CBO, 38.2% (n  = 663) for consistent caregiver monitoring, 53.9% (n  = 930) for living in a safe community, 56.1% (n  = 971) for parental praise, 71.9% (n  = 1246) for food security, 77.9% (n  = 1351) for healthcare access, and 81.1% (n  = 1410) for cash grants. A more detailed analysis of similarities and differences between the YC and CCC subsamples on key demographic and control variables can be found in Supplementary Materials 3 .  3.2 Correlations between hypothesized protective factors As shown in Table 2 , most hypothesized protective factors showed small inter-correlations (<0.30), suggesting no multi-collinearity. However, CBO access was significantly associated with receipt of all other protective factors. This included positive associations with food security, cash grant receipt, access to healthcare and caregiver monitoring, and negative associations with caregiver praise and living in a safe community. Supplementary Material 4  presents the availability of the proposed protective factors depending on our demographic control variables as a first step for investigating drivers of accelerator access.  3.3 Associations between the proposed protective factors and SDG outcomes Each hypothesized protective factor was positively associated with at least two or more outcomes individually, though two negative associations were found between CBO access and not missing school and no caregiver abuse respectively (Supplementary Materials 5 ). For the multivariable model (Table 4 Supplementary Materials 5 ), school enrolment was dropped as an outcome, since it had a base frequency of 98.3%, and this close-to-ceiling effect resulted in too many sparsely populated cells, which prevented model fit. Furthermore, baseline scores for “school enrolment” and “right grade for age” were not controlled for, due to little variation between the time-points. Analyses indicated that after Benjamini-Hochberg corrections, five out of the seven investigated protective factors had accelerating qualities, meaning they were positively associated with three or more SDG outcomes. Together, these five proposed accelerators predicted 12 outcomes overall: food security  was associated with experiencing no depression (OR = 1.5, p  = .002; for confidence intervals, see Table 3  ), good mental health (OR  = 1.41, p  = .017), no peer problems (OR  = 1.47, p  = .005), being in the right grade for age (OR  = 1.33; p  = .015), being able to concentrate at school (OR  = 2.06, p  < .001); and experiencing no caregiver abuse (OR  = 1.61, p  < .001). Living in a safe community  was associated with experiencing no depression (OR  = 2.45, p  < .001), good mental health (OR  = 2.18, p  < .001), no peer problems (OR  = 1.90, p  < .001), higher prosocial behaviour (OR  = 1.30, p  = .017), no substance abuse (OR  = 1.68, p  = .031), being able to concentrate at school (OR  = 1.71, p  < .001), no early sexual debut (OR  = 2.06, p  = .006) and no caregiver abuse (OR  = 1.31, p  = .012). Receiving praise from a caregiver  was associated with experiencing no depression (OR  = 1.69, p  = .001), no suicidal ideation (OR  = 2.54, p  = .001), no post-traumatic stress symptoms (OR  = 2.14, p  < .001), no peer problems (OR  = 1.49, p  = .001), prosocial behaviour (OR  = 1.55, p  < .001), no substance abuse (OR  = 1.95, p  = .003), no early sexual debut (OR  = 1.96, p  = .006), and no violence perpetration (OR  = 1.45, p  < .001). Consistent monitoring by a caregiver  was associated with experiencing no peer problems (OR  = 1.64, p  < .001), no early sexual debut (OR  = 2.43, p  = .016), no violence perpetration (OR  = 1.30, p  = .022) and no caregiver abuse (OR  = 1.34, p  = .011). However, it was also linked to a lower chance of not suffering from post-traumatic stress symptoms (OR  = 0.53, p  = .007). Finally, CBO access  was associated with experiencing no depression (OR  = 3.08, p  < .001), good mental health (OR  = 2.49, p  < .001), no peer problems (OR  = 4.38, p  < .001), higher prosocial behaviour (OR  = 3.76, p  < .001) and no violence perpetration (OR  = 1.45, p  = .018). However, it was also associated with a lower probability of experiencing no caregiver abuse (OR  = 0.53, p  < .001). For each significant association, Fig. 2   presents a graphic representation of changes in adjusted probabilities for having achieved each SDG outcome if each of the protective factors was present, as compared to no protective factors being present. Additive effects between accelerators (see Fig. 3  ) were found for no depression (adjusted risk difference (ARD) for all 5 accelerators being present, as compared to none: + 32.4% points), no suicidality (ARD: +10.3% points), good mental health (ARD: +36.0% points), no peer problems (ARD: +66.5% points), prosocial behaviour (ARD: +52.4% points), substance use (ARD: +4.5% points), no concentration problems at school (ARD: +24.5% points), no early sexual debut (+8.7% points), and no violence perpetration (ARD: +26.4% points). Improvements for no caregiver abuse were not larger than for food security as a single accelerator; however, when CBO access was excluded due to its strong negative association with caregiver abuse (see Table 3 ), a combination of the other four accelerators lead to improvements on this outcome by 26.7% points. For a full table of adjusted probabilities and probability differences for all outcomes, including non-significant effects, see Supplementary Materials 6 .   4 Discussion The current study adds to an emerging evidence base on potential accelerators for achieving the SDGs in an African context (Cluver et al., 2019; Desmond, Sherr, & Cluver, 2020; Sherr et al., 2020 ). In a somewhat younger population than previously studied, consisting of children and adolescents aged 9–13 years living in South Africa, we identified 5 accelerators that positively predicted three or more SDG-related outcomes: food security, living in a safe community, caregiver praise, consistent caregiver monitoring and having access to a CBO. We also found evidence for possible additive effects for nine out of the fourteen investigated SDQ outcomes, where the simultaneous presence of all accelerators had a stronger positive impact than any accelerator on its own. This indicates that a combined application of protective factors may yield additional benefits. Of note, possible additive effects were present for five out of the six mental health outcomes investigated. The only exception was PTSD, a condition that may be strongly determined by trauma characteristics and specific post-trauma reactions (Ehlers & Clark, 2000; Marsac et al., 2014 ). This suggests that applying a combination of the present accelerators may pose a good investment for reducing the mental health burden in children and adolescents living in sub-Saharan Africa. Additive effects were also found for the outcomes of no violence perpetration, no substance abuse and no early sexual debut, and thus across a range of SDG-related outcomes. In contrast, associations with school-related outcomes were limited. Free compulsory education available in South Africa likely led to high rates of school enrolment and attendance, with little room for improvement. This is in line with previous findings showing free schooling may promote attainment, as well as secondary outcomes (mental health, HIV risk) (Keats, 2018; Meinck, Orkin, & Cluver, 2019; UNICEF, 2009 ) and suggests that school access as a government provision could be important in settings with limited resources. Substantial additive accelerator effects were found however for the ability to concentrate at school, which may determine how well a child ultimately performs. Of note, while this factor has been previously linked with mental health difficulties (Humensky et al, 2010 ), inter-correlations in the current study were low to moderate. Future studies may investigate a wider range of school performance outcomes and directly school-related protective factors, such as safe school environments (Cluver et al., 2019 ). Similar to the current findings, previous studies exploring potential protective factors (e.g. Cluver et al., 2016, 2020; Na et al., 2019 ) also highlighted advantageous effects of food security, parental monitoring and positive parenting. However, this study was the first to establish that living in a safe community and CBO access may act as additional accelerators. Key next steps will be to determine what drives access to these protective factors, including socio-demographic variables, and how availability can be altered through interventions (UNDP, 2017 ). There are a range of evidence-based interventions available that target parenting and food security which could be prioritised for inclusion and scale up (e.g. Cluver et al., 2018; Devereux, 2016; Devries et al., 2015; Shenderovich et al., 2021 ), though for some, evidence for scaled delivery is still lacking, which is a key area for future research. Our findings also indicate that measures to improve community safety (e.g. efforts to decrease youth membership in gangs, Higginson et al., 2015 ) and funding directed to CBOs could effectively support improved outcomes in those most at risk. Of note, the current study used observational data, and followed an exploratory analysis approach. Such an approach is valuable for guiding future research into development accelerators but cannot demonstrate causality. Caution should therefore be taken in interpreting null findings for cash grants and healthcare access, as such results may be related to limited statistical power or unaccounted confounding factors. Community-based organizations have been shown to play key roles in supporting vulnerable children and their families by offering a range of different services (Sherr et al., 2016 ). In our study, young people attending CBOs were more likely to experience food security, receive social grants and have access to healthcare. This could indicate that CBO provisions improve access to other accelerators, and/or participants’ resourcefulness. Lower rates of caregiver praise and community safety found in CBO attendants, on the other hand, may reflect the fact that CBOs often target the most vulnerable families (Sherr et al., 2016 ). Overall, while those attending and not attending CBOs came from two different sub-samples that could have differed on unmeasured dimensions, the current findings controlling for a range of demographic factors suggest that CBOs may be well placed as a delivery platform of accelerating services (Yakubovich et al., 2016 ) and require further attention. An important next step will be to investigate the role of quality of service delivery as a factor that could influence whether or not SDG outcomes are improved (Carman, 2007; Carnochan, Samples, Myers, & Austin, 2014 ). Our study was not powered to examine such effects, but well-established findings indicate the importance of factors such as staff versus volunteer providers, resource availability, frequency of attendance and nature of provisions (Desmond, Gow, Loening-Voysey, Wilson, & Sterling, 2002; Tomlinson et al., 2017 ). The strengths of the current study include a focus on early adolescence as an important period of transition, the investigation of a broad range of SDG-related outcomes, as well as an identification of protective factors that may be relevant across different contexts. It furthermore examines the effects of access to community-based organizations, which are currently understudied. However, it also has several limitations. Firstly, methodologically, some measures of relevant constructs differed slightly between the YC and CCC sub-samples-, with standardization and coding measures used to adjust for this. Secondly, although secondary data analysis using existing databases allows for detailed insight, there may be some limitations to measures in terms of depth and range, time of measurement, and missing data. There is thus a need for more robust longitudinal studies that are designed specifically for investigating accelerators, and that also make more extensive use of linkage opportunities (e.g. health registers, school or administrative data) to deepen research in this field. Third, some odds-ratios in the path analyses showed relatively large confidence intervals, potentially due to small cell sizes on rare outcomes, indicating high uncertainty, and inter-correlations between some of the protective factors were moderate. Future studies would be strengthened in their causal claim if they were to evaluate the association between within person change in a protective factor and within person change in multiple outcomes (Curran & Bauer, 2011 ). It will also be key to model whether having access to some accelerators predicts future access to others; and whether combinations of accelerators may show interactive effects, in order to determine the most effective points of intervention. In the current study, we did not find strong evidence of mediation, with the odds-ratios of the accelerator effects not changing substantially through the co-inclusion of all accelerators into the same model; however, this may differ across accelerators and samples. Fourth, a time frame of 1–1.5 years may be considered relatively short for observing change processes. However, factors such as mental health, school performance and peer relations may still be altered substantially over this period of time in children and young adolescents. Longer exposure to protective factors and its effect on SDG outcomes should be investigated in future studies. Finally, the current sample includes a substantial proportion of families affected by HIV, who pose a particularly vulnerable population and may respond differently to accelerators than the general population. However, HIV infection is common in SSA, making our findings more generalizable across this setting. Furthermore, many of the factors identified in the current analyses (e.g. food security, good parenting) have been shown to be effective in improving child and adolescent outcomes across the globe, highlighting they are likely universally beneficial. Despite such limitations, the current study adds to the growing body of evidence identifying accelerators which lead to an effective way of achieving improvements across multiple SDGs in vulnerable populations. This model allows planners to assess conditions (such as food security and education access) and interventions (such as parenting, cash grants or CBO provision) that should be prioritised for comprehensive provision. Utilizing synergy effects may allow governments and policy donors to maximize impacts of interventions, which could be especially relevant in a post-Covid-19 world. As part of this, it will be important to explore added benefits of each accelerator, and whether there is an optimum number in terms of cost-effectiveness. Overall, the SDGs pose an ambitious approach for improving outcomes across social, economic, and environmental domains. The identification of accelerators may enhance effective use of available funding to target policies and interventions to allow children and adolescents across sub-Saharan Africa to reach their full potential.
