JEL classification Q56  Q42  O13  O19   Keywords Renewable energy  Sustainable development goals  Climate finance  Africa  Energy access    1 Introduction In September 2015, the UN General assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which contain 17 goals including ending poverty and hunger, improving health and education, combating climate change, and protecting forests [100] . Increasing the production of renewable energy (RE) can contribute to many of these goals. Any serious effort to achieve the sustainable development goals will thus generate a high demand for RE. This creates an additional need for financing, which has been recognized by the African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI). We analyze how current efforts by the international community and actors within Africa1  1 We focus on the continent of Africa. When statements refer only to Sub-Saharan Africa, this is made explicit.   to finance RE perform and how the remaining shortfall can be addressed. RE has strong synergy effects on the SDG for three reasons. First, and most evidently, it provides energy, which provides the basis for making progress on a number of goals. In Africa, energy is currently a bottleneck for economic growth and thus for reducing poverty [6,25] . Energy has the potential to make agriculture more productive and thus contribute to food security [74] . Further, it has been shown to improve education and even to enhance gender equality [16] . Since RE allows countries to become independent from fuel imports it also contributes to the goal of ensuring a reliable and sustainable form of energy. Second, RE does not cause the local damage which some of the currently widespread alternatives, like traditional biomass and coal, cause. It could thus make a contribution to the goal of ensuring healthy lives by replacing the source of indoor air pollution [95]  and by improving local air pollution from co-emitted air pollutants [107] . It could also improve the welfare of women as the burden of indoor air pollution is currently placed disproportionally on them [20] . In addition, it would promote the sustainable use of ecosystems, in particular forests, by replacing the need to collect firewood [77] . RE is particularly suitable to replace the sources of indoor air pollution as it has been shown to be economically competitive in remote, rural areas, because it can be deployed in a decentralized way [17] . Third, RE generates hardly any CO2  and thus hardly accelerates climate change. While combating climate change is itself one of the SDG it has an effect on the long term prospect of reaching almost all of the other SDG. The damages of climate change as detailed in the IPCC [49]  report are so broad and so harmful that any unsustainably achieved progress on the SDG could be short-lived. The damage to agriculture activities is a direct threat to food security, but also to economic growth on a continent heavily relying on agriculture. In addition it has been shown that increases in food prices increase poverty [51] , thus counteracting effort on reducing poverty and inequality. Other effects of climate change have been shown to affect health adversely [37] . Given these benefits of RE for sustainable development, it could be asked why there is any need for outside support for financing RE. A first reason for the need for support is that the social benefits far outweigh the private benefits for the investor. International organizations could thus use their means to align the needs of society with the investor's incentives. A second reason is the sheer size of the financing challenge, which slows down growth in Africa [24] . The purpose for international organizations like the World Bank and the African Development Bank is to reduce global inequality. Reducing the bottleneck of insufficient RE in Africa could prove to be an investment with an extremely high social rate of return. Finally, there is a more subtle reason for the need for outside support of RE. Generating energy with fossil fuels and with renewable energy has very different investment profiles. Fossil fuel facilities are relatively inexpensive to set up, but require high recurring costs as fuels need to be purchased constantly. RE facilities are expensive to set up, but the energy source is for free or a minor cost factor, so that mainly operation and maintenance cost remain as recurring cost. Which type of investment is most efficient thus depends on the interest rate faced by the investor. In Africa, it is typically the government investing in energy generation. The governments of the continent and also other investors in energy infrastructure, however, can borrow at the market only at high cost so that they are naturally inclined to favor investments in fossil fuel based electricity generation [90] . Given the need for outside support we survey current efforts and assemble possible leverage points for future action. The large gap for additional RE capacity has its roots in the currently very low electricity supply in Africa as well as the very strong growth both in terms of population and in economic terms, which is expected in the remainder of the century. Currently active climate funds use their limited funds for capacity building and pilot projects, but are in no position to contribute directly to ramping up capacity significantly. Increasing the international financing volume is thus an obvious approach to improve the situation. Reducing inefficiencies, providing a reliable investment framework and actively involving the private sector are further promising approaches. In Section 2  we will review the existing evidence on the synergy effects of energy on a number of objectives formulated in the SDG. In Section 3  we analyze the challenges currently faced by African investors for financing the specific investment profile of RE. These are matched with already existing efforts of assisting Africa, including the large funds, in Section 4 . In Section 5  we provide a systematic approach to future solutions along the lines of possible leverage points, available financial instruments and involved actors. Section 6  concludes.  2 Renewable energy and the sustainable development goals In Africa, RE has a large potential to contribute to the SDG in a double sense. In the first sense RE has strong synergy effects and allows improvement on many of the goals at the same time. In the second sense, RE are particularly well suited for Africa due to the favorable natural conditions. Here, we show the link between RE and 10 out of 17 SDG as formulated in United Nations [100] . The ten were chosen as those where the RE effect is most salient. A full list of the SDGs is given in Appendix Appendix A . For most of the SDG we structure the discussion of the effects of RE into a first part with the direct effects of energy availability and reduced local damages and a second part which highlights the potential to avoid the damages to the particular goal through climate change. Climate change is a global problem and Africa currently contributes only a small fraction of the emissions which cause climate change. Nevertheless, Africa has an important role for mitigating climate change and thus in reducing the adverse effects of climate change on the achievement of the SDGs. There are several reasons why early mitigation efforts in Africa are important. First, Africa's participation would facilitate global cooperation. Second, Africa would avoid making itself dependent on carbon intensive energy supplies [101] . Finally, without mitigation efforts Africa would become a major emitter of carbon emissions by the end of the century. The increasing role of Africa for global mitigation efforts has been documented repeatedly. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) expects the working age population in Sub-Saharan Africa to increase by 150% between 2015 and 2050 [99] . According to the World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund, GDP growth will be above 5.5% per year from 2015 to 2019 in Sub-Saharan Africa. The shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) expect in a “middle-of-the-road scenario” that GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa will grow with an average annual rate of 3.5% until 2100, so that it almost reaches the development level of the US today [68] . Given this evidence, Africa has a high level of control over how much climate impacts it will have to face. RE investments can have synergy effects across many of the SDG. However, no single investment can realize all of them at once, because not all households can benefit from the same type of RE provision. Many households are so remote from the national electricity grid that it is not efficient to connect them to it [87] . For these remote communities it would be more efficient to build local microgrids, which deliver the same level of services. Only very small villages cannot be serviced economically with microgrids, so that solar home systems are the better option [13] . Realizing the full range of benefits discussed below would thus require financing solutions for the national grid, microgrids and solar home systems. GOAL 1  End poverty in all its forms everywhere and GOAL 10  Reduce inequality within and among countries. One effect of large-scale RE provision would be to free the financial and time resources of the rural population used for procuring energy. Millions of households spend more than a third of household expenditures on energy and sometimes more than 6 h a day gathering fuelwood [96] . A second effect would be to provide an essential input for consumption and production. 620 million people in sub-Saharan Africa remain without access to electricity [46]  and 19 countries, mostly in central and east Africa, have electrification rates below 20% [36] . Kirubi et al. [59]  Ahlborg and Sjöstedt [3]  show that electricity, in this case from microgrids, can significantly improve worker productivity in rural households. By mitigating climate change, RE can reduce the poverty risks of climate change. The risk of reduced crop productivity and adverse effects on livestock due to heat and drought stress is very high in Africa [49] . Reduced agricultural productivity will increase food prices and severely increase poverty among vulnerable groups such as the urban poor [38] , leading to a slowdown in poverty reduction in Africa [91] . Next to these direct effects Leichenko and Silva [67]  name several indirect effects working through the mechanisms described below for other SDG goals: Climate change can reduce ecosystem services on which subsistence agriculture relies strongly. It has adverse effects on health which then reduces the capacity to earn a living. Finally, it may cause instability and thus slow down economic growth. GOAL 2  End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. Increased efforts to provide RE will make more energy available, which can increase agricultural production and thus provide the means for assuring food security and ending hunger. The intensification of land use during the Green Revolution relied on mechanization and the use of fertilizers and pesticides, all of which is energy intensive [29,58] . Mushtaq et al. [74]  show that rice yields can increase by a factor of more than three through higher energy input. Energy input rises even more than proportionally with food production [86] . While it will be difficult to operate farm vehicles with RE with today's technology, stationary machines, pumps for irrigation, etc. can be operated with electricity from RE. RE can make progress in food security sustainable by reducing the threat of climate change. According to the IPCC [49] , one of the first and most important climate change impacts in Africa is on agriculture through reduced crop productivity and adverse effects on livestock. Comparing different climate and crop models, Nelson et al. [75]  show that the mean agricultural yield decline by 2050 due to climate change will be 17% globally. Müller et al. [73]  show that climate change poses a high risk to African agriculture in spite of large uncertainties. In addition, impacts are likely to be unevenly distributed with “areas of Africa that are already marginal for crop production” being affected very strongly [54] . Schellnhuber et al. [89]  find that Africa is mostly vulnerable in its food production. One reason is that crop production is mostly rainfed so that shifts in precipitation and temperature directly affect crop yields. Taking into account not only the direct effect on harvests, but also on the distribution of the food, Wheeler and von Braun [108]  find that “the stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change”. GOAL 3  Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. The improvement of public health services requires development and thus indirectly energy, as pointed out under Goal 1 above. In addition, the provision of modern forms of energy also has important direct effects. More than 70% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa still relies on traditional biomass [8] . Burning traditional biomass is an important source of indoor air pollution and poses a significant health threat [81] . Reducing exposure to indoor air pollution can drastically reduce the frequency of acute respiratory infections [27] . The most effective way of reducing this exposure is through clean energy types2  2 Indoor air pollution can also be reduced with fossil fuels like kerosene. RE, however, has the advantage of addressing both climate change and indoor air pollution.  [95] . RE also reduces the need for energy generation with fossil fuels. This reduces local air pollution3  3 Geothermal energy can release some gases, but environmental impacts are minor ([48] , Section 4.5).   caused by SO2 , NOX   and particulates [76,107]  and therefore reduces this health threat as well. But aside from a potential to improve health, RE also contributes to avoiding a deterioration of health through climate change. McMichael et al. [72]  consider temperature extremes, floods, aero-allergen production, food-poisoning (diarrhoeal disease), water-borne infection, vector-borne infections, regional crop yields, fisheries and sea-level rise as areas where climate change increases the threat to human health. Patz et al. [84]  also consider the spatial concentration of these effects and find that Africa is an extreme hotspot of climate change attributed mortality. Haines et al. [37]  find that “climate change is an increasing and evolving threat to the health of populations worldwide”. The IPCC [49]  considers “changes in the incidence and geographic range of vector- and water-borne diseases” and “undernutrition, with its potential for life-long impacts on health” as key risks of climate change in Africa. GOAL 4  Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. The direct effect of RE on education is likely to be minor. There is, however, some evidence that it could make a difference in those places with the weakest access so far. [94]  notes that Africa is the continent with the highest share of the population without access to electricity and that RE powered microgrids could extend the time where students can study [16,34,52] . find that improving education is not the primary use for electricity in recently electrified regions, but that electricity access does indeed have a beneficial effect on education. The most remote communities will not benefit from large scale RE production facilities since they cannot be efficiently connected to an electricity grid [13] . The benefits of electricity for education, however, can be obtained from solar home systems or other small scale RE sources [110] . GOAL 5  Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. There is a broad range of effects of RE on gender equality. Girls and woman carry almost the entire burden of procuring traditional biomass, so that much time would be saved for them if RE would be available [96] . The time gained in this way can be used for paid employment, so that electrification significantly raises female employment [20,32] . Since women are also mostly responsible for cooking, they are the ones most exposed to indoor air pollution and are most strongly affected by respiratory diseases [82,95] . Electricity also extends the time available for studying, from which girls benefit disproportionally since they are occupied with household work during the day [16] . Finally, electricity gives access to TV, which has been shown to reduce domestic violence toward women and increase women's autonomy [53] . By mitigating climate change, RE can also reduce the risk of increasing inequality. African women have a disproportionate share in subsistence agriculture [49]  and are more vulnerable due to “social and cultural conditions that influence access to resources and division of labour” [55] . This makes them more vulnerable and thus more likely to be affected by climate change [19,83] . There is evidence, for example, that food-price crises have a more severe impact on female-headed households [66] . GOAL 7  Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. For remote and rural households decentralized solar energy is the lowest cost option [17] . Prices for hydro-power are already competitive and 92% of the capacity in Africa is still unused ([48] , Table 5.1). At the current cost of capital in Africa, however, the high capital intensity of RE energy means that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) are well above those of other sources of energy [15] . This could change, however, since prices for RE are expected to continue falling ([48] , Section 10.5.2) and domestic reforms as well as international support could reduce RE prices in Africa. In addition Bollen et al. [7] , McCollum et al. [70]  and McCollum et al. [71]  show that RE creates significant synergy effects on climate change, energy security and reductions in air pollution. Reliability can be assessed based on the availability of resources and the variability of the energy supply ([48] , Section 9.3.3). RE can make countries independent of limited domestic supplies and the need for imports of fossil fuel resources. The dependence on variable natural energy sources like wind and sunlight, by contrast, is a concern [40] . In Africa, however, sunlight is strong and evenly distributed [15] . In addition, variability concerns occur only at high penetration rates and research efforts aim to improve already existing technical solutions, so that “the global technical potential of RE sources will not limit continued growth in the use of RE” [48] . Concerning sustainability, RE does have environmental impacts as well, but these are much less severe on the aggregate than those of fossil fuel based energy sources ([48] , Section 9.6.5). GOAL 8  Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Providing energy would make a currently scarce production factor available to foster economic growth. Although there is no one-way causality between energy consumption and economic growth in general [80] , it can be shown that “when energy is scarce it imposes a strong constraint on the growth of the economy but when energy is abundant its effect on economic growth is much reduced” [93] . The high cost of energy puts a burden on growth in Africa. It is twice as expensive as in other developing regions [24]  and Africa is highly dependent on energy imports [98] . Frequent electricity outages have been estimated to cost between 1% and 3% of GDP [22] . The lack of reliable electricity makes it necessary for firms to generate electricity themselves [4] . This is inefficient and makes it very difficult for small firms to operate. The provision of electricity has been shown to have very significant effects on development [69,88] . Reacting to the urgent need for energy with a fossil fuel based strategy is no sustainable way of fighting poverty and stimulating growth. Climate change constitutes an important and pressing threat to development. Less developed regions, and in particular Africa, are most vulnerable and have therefore much to gain from effective climate change mitigation. [14]  point out that Africa's vulnerability to climate change has three interacting aspects. First, climate change effects are likely to be particularly severe in Africa. Second, Africa is highly dependent on agriculture so that a large part of the population is directly affected by climate change. Third, Africa has limited capacity to adapt to climate change due to a slow sectoral reallocation of production factors away from agriculture, among others. In addition, climate change has many destabilizing effects and thus creates a difficult environment for economic growth. Major destabilizing effects are increased migration [62,85,106]  and a contribution to violent conflict [10,41,42] . [18]  show that higher temperatures not only reduce the level of growth, but also growth rates. GOAL 13  Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Currently Africa contributes little to climate change. It might thus appear unjust to expect considerable mitigation efforts from a region which has emitted least so far. Africa's population, however, is growing rapidly [12,78]  and the US Energy Information Administration expects energy consumption in non-OECD countries to grow by 84% by 2035 compared to 14% in OECD countries [109] . Effective climate change mitigation will not be possible without the contribution of Africa. A growth strategy without regard for the environment is likely to be based on coal, creating lock-in effects to this technology and making it very unlikely to achieve ambitious climate targets [92] . It is thus a fortunate coincidence that Africa is also well positioned for RE generation. The renewable energy potential in almost all African countries is a multiple of their current energy generation [17] . Krewitt et al. [65]  conclude that “in terms of total renewable electricity potential, Africa is the region that possesses most abundant reneweble energy potential, mainly due to the huge potential for solar technologies”. Africa can exploit what Collier and Venables [15]  call the latecomer effect: Since Africa has not yet installed large amounts of electricity generating facilities, it can avoid the carbon lock-in as described in Unruh [101]  and Unruh and Carrillo-Hermosilla [102] . GOAL 15  Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. There is evidence that fuelwood can, in principle, be a sustainable source of energy [39] . In practice, however, it does threaten forest ecosystems and is often harvested in a very unsustainable manner. In Nigeria for example, the unsustainable use of forests for fuelwood collection appears to be a major problem [77,79] . In Kenya, the preferred tree types for fuelwood are getting very scarce so that fuelwood collection extends increasingly to new tree types [60,61] . For the entire continent, deforestation is a problem, and fuelwood collection contributes to it [57] . The provision of RE could reduce the need for fuelwood, reduce the pressure on forest ecosystems and allow sustainable forest management. By contributing to climate change mitigation, RE can reduce the risks of climate change for damage to ecosystems. The IPCC [49]  identifies several key risks of climate change for ecosystems in Africa. Biomes will shift and diseases and species extinction will threaten wildlife. Sea temperature increases, ocean acidification and sea level rise are likely to degrade coral reefs and cause the loss of entire ecosystems.  3 Financing challenges The previous section highlights that RE has benefits for society, which fossil fuels do not have and that RE does not have costs for society which fossil fuels do have. It is therefore important to distinguish between the social and the private costs of different energy sources. The social costs, that is the cost borne by the entire society, are lower for renewable energy than for fossil fuel based energy. The reason is the external cost of pollution discussed in the previous section. The external cost are imposed on the entire society and in particular on its poorest members. For this reason it is legitimate for international organizations to use their funds to support the energy type with the least social cost. The private costs, that is the direct costs for the investor, are lower for fossil fuel based energy sources than for renewable energy. In this section we track the reasons for the difference between the social and the private cost of energy supply and finally review the estimates on how much funding will be required for RE in Africa in the near future. The low private cost of fossil fuel based energy is the reason that so far very little renewable energy has been installed in Africa. Among the RE sources, hydropower has been very dominant, so that non-hydro sources of electricity have been negligible so far. This extremely low investment into RE is unusual, even compared to other developing regions, see Fig. 1  . Africa records the lowest share of non-hydro-based installed capacity (9%) of RE among the different sources of RE in 2013. Europe, for comparison, has achieved a share of 51%. Shifting investments in electricity generation for the national grids or for microgrids from fossil fuels towards RE will have a large importance for total emissions. In addition, the required financing volume for the grid supply is much larger than for solar home systems. In this chapter we therefore focus on financing challenges for those RE sources which power grids. The financing challenge for solar home systems has been analyzed in Pode [87] , Diouf [21]  and in Chapter 3 of Urmee et al. [103] . 3.1 High cost of RE When considering the cost of RE, the different types need to be distinguished. Biomass, geothermal energy and hydropower have the lowest cost and are already in the price range of fossil fuels. They have an important growth potential (92% of potential hydropower capacity is still undeveloped in Africa for example), but are constrained by social and natural factors. Biomass requires good governance for sustainable use and is ultimately bounded by the availability of land. High-grade geothermal resources are not available everywhere and the total potential is expected to not exceed 3% of global electricity demand by 2050. Hydropower requires the inundation of large areas which often creates the need to relocate the local population [48] . There are for example no plans to extend hydropower considerably in Africa until 2050, see IEA [45] , Fig. 10. A large scale expansion of RE electricity generation is thus likely to depend strongly on solar and wind power. For these two sources of energy, prices have fallen substantially in the recent past [48] . In addition, Africa is very well positioned to make use of them. Seven of the ten most suitable countries for renewable energy potential are in Africa [11] . Nevertheless, solar and wind power are still more expensive than fossil fuel based energy [15] . Production cost have simply not yet reached the very low price of coal, of which practically unlimited amounts are available. In addition to the higher cost for solar and wind power, all renewable energy sources, including hydropower, have an investment profile different from fossil fuel based energy sources. They require large investments in the beginning and have lower running costs afterwards. There is thus a large funding need. Bond markets in Sub-Saharan Africa are small and capital markets are not very developed, so that domestic sources cannot stem the volume required. Foreign capital markets cannot be tapped either as the sovereign credit ratings of most African governments are poor. According to Hussain [43]  financing RE is further hindered since private funders are less familiar with it than with non-renewable energy projects. In a study on the cost of RE in South Africa, Walwyn et al. [105]  claim that the LCOE for solar PV and wind onshore “is close to, or below, grid parity”. The paper also emphasizes that this comparison is less favorable for renewables if the cost of capital are higher than the 5.5% assumed in this study. The US EIA [104]  estimates that LCOE in the US for wind onshore (73.6$/MW h) are already below the cost for conventional coal (95.1$/MW h), which in turn has lower cost than solar PV (125.3$/MW h). According to IRENA [50] , Figure 2.3, the LCOE cost in Africa are higher with close to 200$/MW h for solar PV and close to 100$/MW h for wind onshore.  3.2 High risk of RE Financing risks play a much larger role for RE than for fossil fuel energy. This might appear somewhat surprising as fossil fuel based energy projects are exposed to almost the same risks. The difference is, again, the investment profile. RE requires a much larger initial investment while fossil fuel based energy has higher annual costs. When financing costs increase, RE projects become much more expensive, while costs for fossil fuel energy projects become only moderately more expensive [15,90,97] . RE investors are thus exposed to higher risk when the project fails early on. Studies based on interviews with project developers for RE in Africa find that governance related risks are named most often [5,63] . These governance related risks are regulatory risks (complex bureaucracy, corruption, changing regulation) and political risks (low political stability). Risks related to the project profitability and other risks were named much less frequently. The UNDP [97]  also conducted interviews with investors, but specifically for individual countries, including South Africa and Kenya. These country specific studies confirm the great importance of governance related risks, whereas the regulation and management of the power sector (power market risk, grid integration risk, counterparty risk) were valued more important than general political risk. In addition, currency and macroeconomic risk (for South Africa) and financial sector risk (for Kenya) were given importance.  3.3 Financing need A few studies estimate the financing need for the energy infrastructure in Africa. Most of these estimates are based on the cheapest source of energy and must thus be seen as a lower bound for the investment need in RE. In a study for the World Bank, Briceño-Garmendia et al. [9]  estimate a financing need of $43 billion per year for energy in Africa. Duarte et al. [22] , in a policy brief for the AfDB, arrive at a similar figure of $41 billion, a number also used by UNEP [98] . In another World Bank publication Eberhard et al. [23]  assume that $40.8 billion a year need to be spent in the power sector in Africa. Current spending is estimated to be at $11.6 billion and an additional $8.24 billion could be mobilized by addressing utility inefficiencies, the underpricing of power and poor budget execution. This would leave a funding gap of $20.93 billion annually. The Africa Progress Report 2015 [2]  estimates an investment need of $55 billion annually until 2030. The current level of spending is given as $8 billion. Almost half of the required amount, $21 billion, could come from cutting poorly directed subsidies in the energy sector. Taking a more narrow focus on the investment need (thus leaving out operation and maintenance cost) and considering only Sub-Saharan Africa, model results of the IEA study [46]  show an annual average of $22 billion, of which $7.5 billion are investments into oil, gas and coal. The World Bank study Foster et al. [30]  arrives at a similar number of $23 billion for the funding gap in the electricity sector. Only one study, IEA [44] , estimates the investment need for RE. Africa is included in the region “Middle East and Africa”, which will require $450 billion for the decade from 2010 to 2020. These numbers are also used in the OECD publication Kaminker and Stewart [56] .   4 Existing efforts Resources mobilized from taxes and utility charges account for 80% of total spending on energy infrastructure in Africa [2] . This includes an annual amount of $4 billion since 2010 from private participation infrastructure [35] . The remainder has been financed by international donors. Two major types of actors engaged in financing RE in Africa, development finance institutions (DFIs) and climate funds. While there is a large overlap as the banks partially fund and manage the climate funds, there are some important differences. 4.1 Development finance institutions (DFIs) The World Bank is lending for climate change mitigation directly and manages funds for this purpose. These funds are the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) and the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) with two sub-funds each as well as the most recent Carbon Partnership Facility (CPF). It was the first institution that introduced Green Bonds to fund climate change mitigation. In 2014, the World Bank financing for climate investment increased by $11.3 billion. This amount represents 220 climate projects in 60 countries. The group invested over $42 billion in climate projects during the last four years. Funding approved by the World Bank in energy related projects in Africa is given in Table 1  4  4 “RE and general electricity” refers to all projects in the categories “Energy efficiency in power sector”, “General energy sector”, “Thermal Power Generation”, “Large Hydropower”, “Other Renewable Energy” and “Transmission and Distribution of Electricity” and are not listed under “Oil and gas” (to avoid double counting). The funding source are the World Bank member institutions International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Development Association (IDA) or by other sources. To avoid double counting, projects are listed as “other” only when they are not co-financed by IBRD or IDA.  . The table shows that the World Bank approves a little over $2 billion per year for RE projects in Africa. The African Development Bank (AfDB) offers a whole range of options for African investors seeking to finance RE projects. The most direct form is the annual energy portfolio which reached $2 billion for funding clean energy investments on the continent. This investment is channeled through two lending vehicles: (1) a public vehicle which is mostly concessional for governments and (2) a private window which offers debt and equity. The AfDB also supports the Climate Investment Fund with $625 million annually. Further, the AfDB established the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), a multi-donor trust facility financed by the governments of Denmark and the US with around $60 million annually. In addition to these direct forms of financial support, the AfDB offers two types of services to provide access to the financing of RE. One service is to facilitate access to other funds such as the Global Environment Fund (GEF) and the Green Facility for Africa (GFA) to its regional member countries. The second service are two risk guarantee products: the African Development Bank Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs) and the African Development Fund (ADF) Partial Risk Guarantees in order to encourage the private sector to invest in renewable projects in Africa.  4.2 Climate funds There are various international funds aimed at climate change, some of them also funding RE. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is planned to become the most important one. It was established by the Cancun Agreement in 2010 in order to finance climate change mitigation activities and is not yet operational. Before the establishment of this financial vehicle, a total of 15 climate funds were already available for Africa [1] . The funds in turn are financed by DFI, by multilateral donors or by bilateral donors. An example for a DFI financed fund is the Climate Investment Funds (CIF). It is funded by the World Bank and the regional development banks, including the AfDB. The CIF consists of two climate funds, the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) and the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF). So far, 42% of CTF funding is spent in Africa. The CIF is designed to help developing countries mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. Two examples of funds financed by multilateral donors are the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund (GEFTF) and the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund (GEEREF). The GEFTF is one of the funds administered by the GEF, which is in turn financed by 183 donor countries. Through one of its six focal areas - climate change - it aims to help emerging and developing countries to meet the goals sets by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to mitigate and to adapt to climate change. The GEEREF is financed by the European Union, Germany and Norway. It works as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and aims to provide equity finance to small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) that invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy [33] . Its funds are mainly invested in emerging and developing countries which give priority to energy efficiency and renewable energy [98] . It has invested $26.96 million in two private equity funds in Sub-Sahara Africa. An example for a fund financed by a bilaretal donor is the International Climate Fund financed by the UK. One of the objectives is to provide clean energy in developing countries.  4.3 Financing volume and purpose The total amount of annual funding for RE in Africa is nearly impossible to disentangle. Table 1  in Gujba et al. [33]  gives an idea of the amounts involved. The list however is not claimed to be complete, displays cumulative amounts until 2011 and considers amounts “pledged”, “approved” and “deposited”, not necessarily disbursed. According to [1] , all funds together approved 492 climate change mitigation projects in Africa with a value of $3.5 billion between 2003 and 2013. Of the approved amount 13% were disbursed and 46% were used for mitigation. The average cost of a project is $3.71 million and most approved projects receive less than $10 million. The amount of funding needed for a substantial contribution to energy generation capacity are in a different order of magnitude. The IEA [47]  finds that a typical utility-scale PV system costs between 1.4 and 3.3 $/W. Most power plants in Africa are larger than 50 MW and countries like Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa operate power plans with a capacity of above 1.000 MW. By 2015, around 80 PV power plants with a size of at least 50 MW have been constructed worldwide (though none of them in Africa) and Nzema Solar Park in Ghana is planned to have a capacity of 155 MW [26] . This demonstrates that large-scale PV facilities are used to generate electricity commercially. Considering scale effects, a PV power plant built to contribute to the national power supply can thus be expected to have a size of at least 50 MW. Constructing a PV power plant of 50 MW at a cost of 3.3$/W would cost $165 million. The amounts disbursed by the climate funds is thus in a different order of magnitude from what is required to make substantial contributions to national electricity grids. Accordingly, the objective of projects financed by climate funds is capacity building and some very small RE pilot projects. The GEF for example describes project objectives as “establishing an enabling environment of a policy and regulatory framework” (GEF Project ID 2886), “finance capacity building in the new rural electrification” (ID 2903) and “develop market models for renewables” (ID 2828). The current approach of climate funds in Africa thus is to prepare the ground for RE, not to finance projects capable of contributing significantly to national electricity supply.   5 Future solutions Future solutions to bridge the financing gap will require renewed efforts in current approaches as well as new approaches. We analyze these along the dimensions of leverage points, financial instruments and involved actors. 5.1 Leverage points The generation and distribution of electricity is connected to large inefficiencies in Africa [92] . Reducing these would mobilize significant additional domestic financing. As Fay et al. [28]  emphasize for the decarbonization of development in general, a key leverage point is the volume of international support. Already now Africa is severely short of energy and both the economy and the population are growing rapidly. If Africa is not to repeat the carbon-intensive development path of other world region, it needs massive support from abroad. There is an evident gap between the financing need of around $50 billion annually described in Section 3.3  and the amount spent currently as described in Section 4 . Schmidt [90]  points out that reducing risks for RE investors provides an attractive complement to increasing the relative profitability of RE. One way of de-risking is financial, meaning that the risk is transferred to public sector actors. An alternative is policy de-risking, meaning that the countries improve their institutions and with that their attractiveness as investment destinations. Three examples of financial de-risking are given in Komendantova [64] . Feed-in tariffs are suitable to reduce risks of low prices and insufficient demand. Political risk can be reduced through public agencies such as the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Public-private partnerships can reduce the governance related risks for the private investor. Policy de-risking is specified as regulatory reform, improvements in government accountability and effectiveness and international programs for good governance, anti-corruption and rule of law. Frisari and Stadelmann [31]  use two case studies to show that committed national policy can be combined successfully with financial support from international finance institutions to achieve de-risking. The Africa Progress Panel [2 p. 94] , gives examples of several countries which have achieved notable progress with regulatory reform. In developed regions, investments in energy infrastructure are mostly implemented by private investors. They finance their projects through financial markets. If this approach to financing energy infrastructure would function well, government regulation or public sector support could shift the choice of energy source from fossil fuels to RE. However, the small size of African financial markets and their early stage of development prevent private actors from investing the large sums necessary for RE. Current efforts of developing financial markets like the African Financial Markets Initiative (AFMI) of the AfDB and the World Bank projects like the “Financial Sector Support Project” in Kenya could thus open the way for more private sector involvement in the medium term.  5.2 Financial instruments Currently, grants dominate the financing of RE projects in Africa by climate funds. 95% of the projects of the climate funds were funded with grants, 3% with loans and less that 1% with private equity. Most countries received only grants. Only 14 countries received other forms of financing and only Botswana, Equatorial Guinea and South Africa have a share of grants lower than 50% [1] . Grants have the advantage of not requiring highly developed financial markets and are used for small scale projects. The bulk of implementing large-scale RE projects will, however, need to be financed through borrowing. Given the difficulty of financing large infrastructure projects in Africa, investors would in most cases opt for the cheapest form of generating energy if not assisted by the international community. The most promising financing instruments for RE are thus subsidized forms of borrowing. One option are soft or concessional loans, which are funded by regional development banks. Due to guarantees by state members, regional development banks have access to very low interest rates, which they can pass on to investors. A second subsidized form of borrowing is green bonds. The World Bank and the AfDB started in 2008 and 2010, respectively, to issue green bonds. In 2014, new green bond issuance reached $30 billion and is expected to grow. Another form of subsidized borrowing is through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). This has the advantage of leveraging public funds and of protecting private investors from the governance related risks described in Section 3.2 . Finally, non-subsidized forms of borrowing could play a role in the future. These could take the form of hard loans, equity financing or asset-backed securities. They have the advantage of forcing investors to develop viable projects. A large scale deployment, however, will require two crucial conditions. The first is a regulatory environment, which favors RE in such a way that they are not driven out of the market by cheaper sources of energy. An effective regulatory measure could be a price on carbon emissions, which would force fossil fuel users to internalize the social damage of their emissions. The second condition is a financial market capable of stemming large and long-running infrastructure projects.  5.3 Actors The African governments are at the heart of almost all activities for RE finance. Through their state owned power-sector utilities, they are by far the most important investors [23] . First, they can reduce inefficiencies in electricity generation and thus mobilize already available sources. Second, they can increase their own borrowing by presenting viable RE projects to tap into the DFIs financing offers and by striving to improve their credit rating through good governance in order to make use of commercial lending. Third, they can make it easier for private investors to finance RE projects. This can be achieved by engaging in de-risking, in particular by reducing governance related risks. Private investors can further be encouraged to invest in RE by providing a regulatory framework which charges polluters with the social damage, for example through a carbon tax. Finally, private investors can be supported by implementing plans for financial development. The main role of DFIs and climate funds will be to assure that the volume of available finance rises to the challenge of RE investment needs identified by the World Bank, the IEA and others as detailed in Section 3.3 . Efforts in capacity building, knowledge and technology transfer are already at a high level. International donors can also play an important direct role (in addition to existing support for DFIs and climate funds). China and Brazil for example have pledged funds for addressing climate change in bilateral initiatives like the South-South Cooperation Fund on Climate Change. Finally, private investors might be able to engage in the large future business area of RE more actively by pushing for more PPP initiatives and by identifying the barriers to increase RE investment. The studies on the most important risks described in Section 3.2  might point the way for this: Private investors emphasized their concern on governance-related risks. This could increase pressure for change on governments.   6 Conclusion We have shown that RE has a great potential to simultaneously achieve economic, social and environmental objectives as formulated in the SDG. RE thus constitutes an extremely promising investment opportunity from a social point of view. Only a small portion of these social benefits, however, can be reaped by those investing in African energy facilities. From this it follows that substantial further efforts are required both by domestic and by international actors. African governments can improve their ability to finance crucial projects for the future of their populations. One important step for this is to improve governance with the objective to achieve a better credit rating and thus reduce their financing cost. A second important step is to improve the quality of local financial markets in order to increase the domestic funding capacity. As long as the domestic funding ability in Africa is still developing, international funding agencies need to increase the volume of investment. Currently available funds fall considerably short of needs to achieve full electrification and a shift towards RE.
