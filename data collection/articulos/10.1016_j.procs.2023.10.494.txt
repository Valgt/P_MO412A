                  Everyday life and the workings of the economy depend on reliable and affordable energy services, such as electricity supply. Guaranteeing universal access to sustainable energy services is fundamental for socioeconomic development. This paper assessed the implementation of the sustainable development goal in the European Union countries in the seventh area "Affordable and clean energy" out of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDG7) formulated in the document “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. To assess the implementation of the seventh objective, the VMCM method was used, which allows for the ranking and classification of objects described with many features as representing the dynamics of changes in the studied phenomenon. As a result, each EU country was assigned to one of four classes appointed by the level of goal achievement SDG7. The country with the highest value of level of goal were assigned to Class 1, while those measured the lowest were assigned to Class 4. It presented in dynamic perspective comparing changes over 9 years (since year 2012 to 2021).

Introduction  At the turn of the 1970s and 1980s, the idea of sustainable development was born [1,2]. The concept of sustainable  development was first comprehensively described in the report 1987 entitled â€œOur Common Futureâ€�, developed by  the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development, also referred to as â€œBrundtland  Commissionâ€�[3]. The main direction in the concept of sustainable development is the well-being of the current and  future generations [4-7], which is why this concept is the basis for estimating the level of human development in  various economies, as well as assessing the effectiveness of programs and development policies applied in them. At  the Sustainable Development Summit, which took place in 25 September 2015 in New York, during the plenary session  of the UN General Assembly, representatives of the governments of 193 member states reached an agreement on the  final document: "Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development"[8]. It contains 17  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). and 169 tasks to eradicate poverty and build a more sustainable world over  the next dozen or so years. The SDGs address key systemic barriers to sustainable development such as inequality,  unsustainable consumption patterns, weak institutional capacity and environmental degradation [9]. SDGs are called  global goals and are treated as road signs valid until 2030 to lead all entities to a more prosperous, just and peaceful  world. Using the definition from the report of the Bruntland Commission [3], sustainable development in 2030, the  Agenda is understood as intergenerational solidarity consisting in finding such solutions that guarantee further growth,  which allow all social groups to be actively involved in development processes, while giving them the opportunity to  benefit from economic growth. To achieve sustainable development, therefore, the coherence of three key elements is  required: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection, which are interconnected and extremely  important for achieving the well-being of individuals and entire societies [10,11].  Since 2001, the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development has been implemented. Sustainable  development has officially become one of the European Union's long-term objectives under Article 3(3) of the Treaty  on European Union. The European Union (EU) has fully committed itself to delivering on the 2030 Agenda, and the  SDGs form an intrinsic part of the European Commissionâ€™s work programme. The European Union countries have  adjusted the indicators for monitoring development progress, approved in May 2017, to the 17 SDGs.   Based on these indicators, a report was prepared in October 2017, which is the beginning of Eurostat's regular  monitoring of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals in the context of the EU. The set of indicators  includes 100 indicators organized according to 17 Sustainable Development Goals, but for each of the SDGs, the  focus is on aspects relevant to the EU [12].  Monitoring is an essential component in realising the 2030 Agendaâ€™s vision, both globally and in the EU, by assessing  and visualising the progress made so far towards the 17 SDGs. Since 2017, Eurostat has been preparing annual reports  monitoring the progress towards the SDGs in the EU context.   The concept of sustainable development takes on special importance during the scarcity of fossil fuels and the  disruption of the global energy market caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 8 March 2022, the European  Commission proposed the outline of a plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030,  in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine [13]. There is a double urgency to transform Europe's energy system: ending  the EU's dependence on Russian fossil fuels, which are used as an economic and political weapon, and tackling the  climate crisis. Guaranteeing universal access to energy services is strategical for socioeconomic development. There  can be no sustainable development without universal access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy. Sustainable  Development Goal 7 called â€žAffordable and clean energyâ€� calls for ensuring universal access to modern energy  services, improving energy efficiency and increasing the share of renewable Energy. In this context, of energy  transformation has unusual dimensions: legal and political, technological, economic and, above all, social.   Therefore, this problem should be treated as a multidimensional issues described by many indicators.  Multidimensional Comparative Analysis (MCA) is an adequate approach, which can have the possibility for an  objective with automated analysis and finding solutions for the problem under consideration. This group of methods  include also, for example: TOPSIS (The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) TOPSIS  [14-15], VIKOR (Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje) which means multicriteria optimization  and compromise solution, in Serbian [16-18], HELLWIG [19], and VMCM (Vector Measure Construction Methods)  [20-22].  The aim of the article is to examine the possibility of using and usefulness of the VMCM method to assess the  implementation of SDG 7 â€œAffordable and clean energyâ€�. The example used in this study concerns the assessment  of 28 EU countries in terms of Affordable and clean energy. The analysis with using VMCM method will be based   Piotr Ogonowski  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 4943â€“4951 4945  Piotr Ogonowski/ Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000â€“000  3  on the Eurostat database. Selected indicators of SDG 7 â€“ (affordable and clean energy) from the year 2012 - 2021  will be taken into account and analysed [23].  2. Materials and Methods  In this research the VMCM (Vector Measure Construction Method) method used was applied as a methodical tool  to assess Sustainable Development - Goal 7. A group of SDGs indicators obtained from the Eurostat database [23],  covering the time horizon of 2012-2021, was analyzed. They are related to the 7th Sustainable Development Goal in  the context of the EU. This group (one of seventeen) marked as "Affordable and clean energy" includes the following  indicators [24]:  x1 â€“ final energy consumption in households per capita (in KGOE - Kilogram of oil equivalent);  x2 â€“ energy productivity (ii Euro per kilogram of oil equivalent (KGOE));  x3 â€“ population unable to keep home adequately warm by poverty status (in %);  x4 â€“ renewable energy sources in heating and cooling (in %);  x5 â€“ renewable energy sources in transport (in %);  x6â€“ renewable energy sources in electricity (in %);  x7â€“ final energy consumption (in Million tonnes of oil equivalent);  x8â€“ primary energy consumption (in Million tonnes of oil equivalent);  x9â€“ energy import dependency by products (in %);  Analyzed countries (variants) were: Austria (AT), Belgium(BE), Bulgaria(BG), Croatia(HR), Cyprus(CY),  Czechia(CZ), Denmark(DK), Estonia(EE), Finland(FI), France(FR), Germany(DE), Greece(EL), Hungary(HU),  Ireland(IE), Italy(IT), Iceland(IS), Latvia(LV), Lithuania(LT), Luxembourg(LU), Malta(MT), Netherlands(NL),  Norway(NO), Poland(PL), Portugal(PT) Romania(RO), Slovakia(SK), Slovenia(SI), Spain(ES), Sweden(SE). Data  referred to the year 2012-2021 and were obtained from the Eurostat database.  2.1. Vector Measure Construction Method  The VMCM method utilizes the vector calculus properties in order to build vector synthetic measure (basing on  the definition of the scalar product) [25]. Such an approach enables for making ranking, classification of objects and  study of change dynamics. The procedure of VMCM comprises 8 stages [26]:  Stage 1-2. Selection and elimination of variables   In the paper the diagnostic variables was selected as expert judgment (substantive) method. Elimination of variables  is carried out by using significance coefficient of features [27-29]:  i i x x V i ï�³ï€½  ,   (1)  where:   ix â€“ i-th variable,  iï�³ â€“ standard deviation of the i-th variable,  ix â€“ mean value of the i-th variable,  whereas:  n x x n j j i i ïƒ¥ ï€½ï€½ 1  ,   (2)  and  4946 Piotr Ogonowski  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 4943â€“4951 4 Piotr Ogonowski/ Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000â€“000  1 2 1 ï€­ ïƒ· ïƒ¸ ïƒ¶ ïƒ§ ïƒ¨ ïƒ¦ ï€­ ï€½ ïƒ¥ ï€½ n xx n j i j i iï�³   .   (3)  The significance coefficient values of the variables must be within the range <0;0,1> the variable which is outside  of this range should be eliminated from the set of diagnostic variables [27-29].  Stage 3. Defining the diagnostic variables character  The diagnostic variables character may have: (stimulants, destimulants and nominants). Stimulants are such  variables, which greater values mean the higher level of development of complex socio-economic studied process. In  the research the variables which has stimulants character are: x1 â€“ final energy consumption in households per capita;  x2 â€“ energy productivity; x4 â€“ renewable energy sources in heating and cooling; x5 â€“ renewable energy sources in  transport; x6â€“ renewable energy sources in electricity; x7â€“ final energy consumption;  Destimulants are such variables which smaller values mean the higher level of development of complex socio- economic studied process. In the research x3 â€“ population unable to keep home adequately warm by poverty status ;  x8â€“ primary energy consumption; x9â€“ energy import dependency by products has destimulant character.     While nominants are such variables, which desired values are within a specific range.  Stage 4. Defining the diagnostic variables weight  In the research problem such of variables was non-statistical information used, in which the weights are usually  determined by the expert assessment method, they are so-called substantive weights.  Stage 5. Normalization of variables  The variables can occur in the data base in different units of measure, which additionally hinder any arithmetic  operations. Therefore, the next stage in the construction of the measure of development is normalizing variables. In  the research the variables was normalized according of formula:    ?Ì�?ï¿½ï¿½ = ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ ,   (4)  ð�‘Žï¿½ = ð�‘¥ï¿½ï¿½ âˆ’ ?Ì…?,   (5)  Stage 6. Determination of pattern and anti-pattern  In the research the pattern and anti-pattern was automatically determined. For the variables which has stimulant  character the pattern was constructed based on the first quartiles and third quartile for variable values which have  destimulants character. For the anti-pattern was third quartile for variable values which have stimulants and first  quartiles for destimulans.  Stage 7-8. Construction of the aggregate measure and Classification of objects  The last two stages of the VMCM method is construction of the aggregate measure and classification of objects. The  value of the aggregate measure is within the range from zero to one. The aggregate measure value equal to zero for  anti-pattern and value equal to one for the pattern. The object's which have the value of measure more than one are  better than the pattern. Objects that are worse than the anti-pattern will have a negative value of measure. In order to  better visualize the results of calculations, objects can be divided into classes with similar measurement values. In the  research we have four class: class number I is for best object, class II for a good object, class III is for object which  have mean value of the aggregate measure and class IV for the lowest value of the aggregate measure.

Results and discussion   Experiment - estimation of the implementation of SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy on the example of ranking  of 29 EU countries  The study used data from the Eurostat database to estimate the of the implementation of SDG 7 Affordable and  Clean Energy. As the case study in the paper assessed of the SDG 7 was made according to nine indicators: x1 â€“ final  energy consumption in households per capita; x2 â€“ energy productivity; x3 â€“ population unable to keep home  adequately warm by poverty status; x4 â€“ renewable energy sources in heating and cooling; x5 â€“ renewable energy  sources in transport; x6 â€“ renewable energy sources in electricity; x7 â€“ final energy consumption; x8 â€“ primary energy  consumption; x9 â€“ energy import dependency by products. All nine indicators were collected from Eurostat, for the  analysis. In the analysis ware included 27 countries from European Union and two which are not from EU but are in  Schengen zone (Norway and Iceland). Longitudinal data also from 9 years (2012 â€“ 2021) was analyzed, which allows  to answer the question, whether of the implementation of SDG 7 is changing over time.                            Fig. 1 Result of ranking the first class of EU countries, for the data from (2012-2021) year, in terms realization of SDG 7 with the use of  VMCM  From the figure 1, it can be concluded that the situation in Norway (NO) end Iceland (IS) in terms of development,  the implementation of SDG 7 has been stable since, because since 2015 they have been in the top position in the  ranking among 29 given analyzes of EU countries in first class among the best. In 2014 Norway's position dropped in  the ranking from first place to secend but only for a year. This change results from the fact that of indicator x1 - final  energy consumption in households per capita of the nature of stimulants decreased end Sweden there was a one-off  increase of 50%. The highest class 1 is observed in 5 EU countries: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Austria.                            Fig. 2.

In 2013-2017 Finland increased position in the ranking from  second class to first class among the best. This change in results is may be due to the fact that the percentage of x4 â€“  renewable energy sources in heating and cooling (in %) having the stimulants character, increased. Moreover, of 2017  the values of variable, x9 â€“ energy import dependency by products, having the destimulants character, increased. The  position of Finland in the ranking decreased (2017-2021) to the second class.                                  Fig. 3. Result of ranking the third class of EU countries, for the data from (2012-2021) year, in terms realization of SDG 7 with the use of  VMCM.  From the third graph it can be concluded that the situation in the third class is stable, most of the objects have not  changed their position in the ranking. In 2019-2021, a slight increase in Estonia can be noticed. This change in results  is may be due to the fact that the percentage of x5 â€“ renewable energy sources in transport (in %) having the stimulants  character, increased about 95%. Detailed data in this respect are presented in Graph 3.                                  Fig. 4. Result of ranking the fourth class of EU countries, for the data from (2012-2021) year, in terms realization of SDG 7 with the use of  VMCM.  In class 4 are four EU countries: Cyprus, Bulgaria, Marta and Greece illustrated in graph 4. Form the figure 4 it can  be concluded that the value of the aggregate measure for Bulgaria is decreased. This fact may be due to the high level  he percentage of x3 â€“ population unable to keep home adequately warm by poverty status (29th position in 2012- 2021).

Conclusions  Energy is one of important elements of socio-economic development, and its availability has a significant impact on  improving the quality of life. Energy enables the smooth functioning of all economic sectors, from micro-enterprises  to large business, from agriculture to mining, manufacturing, construction and services. SDG 7 calls for ensuring  universal access to modern energy services, improving energy efficiency and increasing the share of renewable energy.   To assess the complex socio-economic issue described by many indicators usually we use the multidimensional  comparative analysis method. The VMCM method, as other multi-criteria methods, makes it possible to evaluate  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 12 20 13 20 14 20 15 20 16 20 17 20 18 20 19 20 20 20 21 M ea su re Sweden Norway Austria Iceland Denmark 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 20 12 20 13 20 14 20 15 20 16 20 17 20 18 20 19 20 20 20 21 M ea su re Finland Germany France Luxembourg Ireland Latvia Italy Slovenia a) b)  -1,5 -1 -0,5 0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 20 12 20 13 20 14 20 15 20 16 20 17 20 18 20 19 20 20 20 21 M ea su re Greece Cyprus Malta Bulgaria b) 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 3 3,5 4 4,5 20 12 20 13 20 14 20 15 20 16 20 17 20 18 20 19 20 20 20 21 M ea su re Netherlands Belgium Czechia Croatia Estonia Hungary Romania Poland Slovakia Spain Portugal Lithuania a)  4950 Piotr Ogonowski  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 4943â€“49518 Piotr Ogonowski/ Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000â€“000  variants based on defined criteria and conduct a ranking process. In the experiment, the Vector Measure Construction  Methods will be used to assess the realization of SDG7 for the European Union countries. In the analysis ware included  29 countries from European countries. The study used data from the Eurostat database to estimate the of the  implementation of SDG 7 â€“ (affordable and clean energy). Longitudinal data from 9 years (2012 â€“ 2021) was analysed,  which allows to answer the question, whether of the implementation of SDG 7 is changing over time. In order to  assess the of the implementation of SDG 7 of the European Union countries, studies were conducted based on 9  selected indicators.   Research has shown in terms of the implementation of SDG 7 indicators, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland,  Austria with the highest value of the aggregate measurements and were in the first class. In 2014 Norway's position  dropped in the ranking from first place to secend but only for a year. This change results from the fact that of indicator  x1 - final energy consumption in households per capita of the nature of stimulants decreased and Sweden there was a  one-off increase of 50%. In additional it can be concluded that the situation has changed in the second class, in 2013- 2017. Finland increased position in the ranking from second class to first class among the best. This change in results  is may be due to the fact that the percentage of x4 â€“ renewable energy sources in heating and cooling (in %) having  the stimulants character, increased. Whereas of 2017 the values of variable, x9 â€“ energy import dependency by  products, having the destimulants character, increased. The position of Finland in the ranking decreased (2017-2021)  to the second class. In 2019-2021, in the third class, a slight increase Estonia can be noticed. This change in results is  may be due to the fact that the percentage of x5 â€“ renewable energy sources in transport, (in %) having the stimulants  character, increased about 95%. An additional it can be concluded that in class 4 the value of the aggregate measure  for Bulgaria is decreased. This fact may be due to the high level he percentage of x3 â€“ population unable to keep home  adequately warm by poverty status (29 th position in 2012-2021).  The goal-level assessment of SDG 7 â€“ (affordable and clean energy) is strongly influenced by the measures taken  in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions (schools, cinemas, shopping centers closed) on  public life and lower economic activity. In contrast, the Russian-Western standoff due to the invasion of Ukraine has  produced an unprecedented increase in energy prices, especially in Europe. It is important to note that the increase in  energy prices already observed in 2021 is not yet reflected in these data the Eurostat.  The results of the analysis showed that applying VMCM method to assess the of the implementation SDG 7 is very  useful and provides better understanding of multidimensional data.

Guaranteeing universal access to sustainable energy services is fundamental for socioeconomic development. This paper assessed the implementation of the sustainable development goal in the European Union countries in the seventh area "Affordable and clean energy" out of seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDG7) formulated in the document “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. To assess the implementation of the seventh objective, the VMCM method was used, which allows for the ranking and classification of objects described with many features as representing the dynamics of changes in the studied phenomenon. As a result, each EU country was assigned to one of four classes appointed by the level of goal achievement SDG7. The country with the highest value of level of goal were assigned to Class 1, while those measured the lowest were assigned to Class 4. It presented in dynamic perspective comparing changes over 9 years (since year 2012 to 2021).
