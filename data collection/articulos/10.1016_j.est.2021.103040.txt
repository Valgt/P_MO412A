                  Battery energy storage system (BESS) has many purposes especially in terms of power and transport sectors (renewable energy and electric vehicles). Therefore, the global demand for batteries is projected to rise by 25% per annum. In this context, given the recent sharp increase of BESS utilization and its progressing impact on the world energy sector, evaluation of its effect on achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) is limitedly explored and must be investigated. This is a critical research gap, as we find that BESS may influence the ability to meet all SDGs. To assess the BESS impacts, 17 SDGs were divided into three groups, including environment, society, and economy as per the three key pillars of sustainable development. In assessing the BESS impacts, an expert elicitation model is used to show how the BESS affects the positive and negative impact on the 169 targets of 17 SDGs under the environment, society and economy group. We found that the BESS positively impacts the achievement of 60 targets (35.5%) of all SDGs, but it may negatively impact the accomplishment of 22 targets (13%). With the current development and exponential growth of BESS shares along with addressing certain present limitations, these impacts may cover additional targets in the future. However, present research foci neglect significant facets. Our assessment shows that the rapid growth and evolution of BESS must be accompanied by the requisite regulatory insight and technology regulation for sustainable development.

Battery energy storage system (BESS) has many purposes especially in terms of power and transport sectors (renewable energy and electric vehicles). Therefore, the global demand for batteries is projected to rise by 25% per annum. In this context, given the recent sharp increase of BESS utilization and its progressing impact on the world energy sector, evaluation of its effect on achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) is limitedly explored and must be investigated. This is a critical research gap, as we find that BESS may influence the ability to meet all SDGs. To assess the BESS impacts, 17 SDGs were divided into three groups, including environment, society, and economy as per the three key pillars of sustainable development. In assessing the BESS impacts, an expert elicitation model is used to show how the BESS affects the positive and negative impact on the 169 targets of 17 SDGs under the environment, society and economy group. We found that the BESS positively impacts the achievement of 60 targets (35.5%) of all SDGs, but it may negatively impact the accomplishment of 22 targets (13%). With the current development and exponential growth of BESS shares along with addressing certain present limitations, these impacts may cover additional targets in the future. However, present research foci neglect significant facets. Our assessment shows that the rapid growth and evolution of BESS must be accompanied by the requisite regulatory insight and technology regulation for sustainable development.   Keywords Batteries  Sustainable development goals  Energy storage  Renewable energy  Electric vehicles Climate change  Sustainability    1 Introduction Today, energy production, energy storage, and global warming are all common topics of discussion in society and hot research topics concerning the environment and economy [1] . However, the battery energy storage system (BESS), with the right conditions, will allow for a significant shift of power and transport to free or less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by linking both sectors together and converting renewable energy (RE) to a reliable base rather than an alternative source. On the basis of recent studies, global demand for batteries is projected to increase by 25% a year to arrive at about 2600 GWh in 2030 [2–4] . This could allow batteries to decrease carbon emissions inside transport and power sectors by 30%, offer power access to six hundred million folks who presently do not have access to it, and secure around 10 million stable jobs worldwide [3 ,4 ]. Moreover, BESS serves as an electric vehicle (EV) energy storage and, according to the base case scenario, it is anticipated that over 34 million different types of EVs will be sold in 2030 [5 ,6 ]. Therefore, the BESS plays an ever greater and more sustainable role in three zones which are decarbonization of the transport section via electrification, allow transitions from traditional fuel to renewables for power generation, and help provide off-grid communities access to electricity. This indicates that the BESS may minimize GHG emissions significantly within the power and transport fields This indicates that the BESS may minimize GHG emissions significantly within the power and transport fields, which now account for roughly 40% of global GHG emissions [2 ,3 ] and contribute to the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). Generally, the BESS utilization, development, applications, and recycling has a role in the future of sustainability for the long- or short-term. Contrarily, the BESS has some challenges and negative effects on different sectors [7–11]  that must be addressed if humanity wants to reach a promising and bright energy future with less negative environmental, economic, and social impacts. Some recent studies focused on linking the relationship between the impact of BESS on sustainability [12] , ecosystem and agricultural areas near battery factories [13 ,14 ], circular economy [15 ,16 ], climate issues [17 ,18 ], human health [19] , and grid decarbonization [7 ,20 ,21 ]. To date, however, no research article has systematically examined the degree to which BESS could affect all facets of sustainable development-identified in this research as the 169 targets of the 17 SDGs agreed internationally in the 2030 sustainable development agenda. This is a critical research gap that must be filled because the BESS could affect the potential to achieve the 169 targets of SDGs. On the other hand, the global demand for batteries is expected to grow by 25% per year because it serves numerous applications, particularly in the renewable energy and transportation sectors [22] . Due to the recent sharp increase of BESS utilization, many studies in the literature have been conducted in terms of its efficiency, thermal management, storage capacity, material design, pollution, recycling, and etc. However, an assessment of the impact of BESS on achieving the SDGs had not been analyzed so far. This is a critical research gap, as we find that BESS may influence the ability to meet all SDGs. Therefore, this study is conducted to present, discuss, and explore implications of how BESS can either enable or inhibit the delivery of all 17 goals and 169 targets recognized in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Relationships were characterized by the methods reported at the end of this study, which can be summarized as a consensus-based expert elicitation process, informed by previous studies aimed at mapping SDGs interlinkages [23-25] . Our review of relevant evidence shows that BESS may act as an enabler on 60 targets (35.5%) across all SDGs, generally through a technological improvement, which may allow it to overcome certain present limitations. However, 22 targets (13%, also across all SDGs) may experience a negative impact from the development of BESS. For the purpose of this study, we divide the SDGs into three categories, according to the three pillars of sustainable development, namely Society, Economy, and Environment (see the Methods section). This classification allows us to provide an overview of the general areas of influence of BESS. This study is divided into five sections. Section 2  outlines methods of the study including the expert elicitation process, final analysis of the collected data, and limitations of the research. An assessment on the impacts of BESS towards achieving SDGs is presented in Section 3 . In this Section, the analysis review of the impact of BESS on the economy, environment and society is discussed in detail. Next, towards sustainable utilization of BESS on achieving the SDGs has been discussed in Section 4 . Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and summary of the study along with recommendations/suggestions for future study from the standpoint of academic research and engineering applications.  2 Methods of the study This section describes the procedure used to achieve the findings reported in the current study which summarized and abbreviated in Table 1  . The goal was to answer the question “Is there published evidence of BESS acting as an enabler or an inhibitor for this particular target?” for each of the 169 targets within the 17 SDGs. Towards this goal, we performed an expert elicitation procedure focused on consensus, advised by previous research on the interlinkage mapping of SDGs. The authors of this study are academics spanning a wide range of disciplines, including energy, engineering, environmental, and natural sciences which serve as experts within the elicitation technique. To support the established linkage between BESS utilization, development, and application with the 169 targets, the authors conducted an expert-driven academic publications search where the following sources of information were considered as acceptable evidence:• Research published on actual-international applications provided that the analyzed publications have adequate quality.  • Research published on laboratory/controlled eventualities provided that the publications taken into consideration within the evaluation have been of adequate quality.  • Published data, reports, and published evidence from authorized/accredited organizations, such as government bodies and UN.  • Applications recorded on the commercial level.    However, the following resources of knowledge were not deemed to be sufficient proof such as actual-international applications with lack of peer-reviewed study; media; public beliefs; educated assumptions; and other means of knowledge. 2.1 Expert elicitation process In this stage, an expert elicitation process was conducted as follows: each of the SDGs was assigned to one or more main contributors, and in some cases to several additional contributors. The main contributors carried out a first literature search for that SDG and then the additional contributors completed the main analysis. One published study on a synergy or a trade-off between a target and BESS was considered enough for mapping the interlinkage. However, for nearly all targets several references are provided. After the analysis of a certain SDG was concluded by the contributors, a reviewer was assigned to evaluate the connections and reasoning presented by the contributors. The reviewer was not part of the first analysis and we tried to assign the roles of the main contributor and reviewer to experts with complementary competences for each of the SDGs. The role of the reviewer was to bring up additional points of view and considerations, while critically assessing the analysis. Then, the main contributors and reviewers iteratively discussed to improve the results presented for each of the SDGs until the analysis for all the SDGs was sufficiently refined. The detailed expert elicitation assessment is done based on the creation of framework, elicitation of expert structure and consumption of experts’ judgement as illustrated in Fig. 1  .  2.2 Final analysis In this stage, after reaching a consensus on the assessment of the evidence for each goal which (briefly shown in Table 1 ), analysis of the final results has been done by determining the number of targets may act as an enabler or an inhibitor and calculated the percentage of targets with positive and negative impact of BESS for each of the 17 goals, as shown in Table 2  . Next, we evaluated the findings and measured the proportion (in percentage %) as a positive or negative impact for every one of the 169 targets within the 17 goals. Summary of the analysis obtained from the research is shown in Fig. 2  . Based on the literature, a comprehensive list of all SDGs along with each of their constituent targets and the detailed findings and evidence are analyzed in detail. The BESS considered in this study includes all battery types, which currently exist in the market and used in different applications, especially in the power and transportation sectors. Moreover, the 17 SDGs were divided into three groups, namely, Environment, Society, and Economy in accordance with the grouping/classifications described by Ref. [131 ,132 ]. The 17 SDGs assigned to every group are shown in Fig. 3  , however; the individual results from each of these groups can be observed in Figs. 4–6    . These figures indicate, for each target within each SDG, whether any published evidence of positive or negative impact was found.  2.3 Limitations of the research The investigation and assessment presented in this study reflect the authors’ point of view based on the literature. In addition, several studies on how the BESS influences certain targets within the 17 SDGs could have been overlooked by the contributors or proof of such interlinkage may not have been reported yet. However, the approaches used attempted to reduce the assessment's subjectivity. For every interlinkage, several authors assessed, analyzed, and reviewed various published evidence on the impact of BESS carefully to highlight its delivery of every target. Moreover, some of the advantages and disadvantages of RE have been involved in evaluating the positive and negative impacts of batteries due to the overlap and interconnectedness between them, and this may affect the evaluation regarding few targets. Many types of batteries exist, thus, the negative or positive effect of one type may differ from the other. Therefore, even though the inequality impacts in this regard are negligible, not taking this issue in the assessment provided could be considered one of the limitations in this study. Lastly, this research is based on SDGs analysis. The SDGs offer a strong perspective to look at globally defined objectives on sustainable development and provide a path forward for reflecting all aspects of sustainability, including social sustainability, human rights [133] , environmental development, and economic outcomes. The SDGs, however, are a political settlement and could be restricted to describing a few of the dynamic complexities and cross-interactions between different targets. Consequently, it must be considered a complement along with former, existing, and other international norms as a replacement [23] .   3 Assessment on the impacts of BESS towards achieving SDGs To assess the impact of BESS on each of the 169 targets within the 17 SDGs in the 2030 agenda, we undertook a method designed to answer the question: Does evidence on the negative or positive effects of BESS role towards achieving this specific target exist. The review assessment of the related indicates that the BESS positively impacts 60 targets which represent 35.5% of all SDGs, however; with the current improvement and wide application of BESS, these impact may cover additional targets in the future. Meanwhile, 22 targets (13%, of all SDGs) can reveal a bad effect from the BESS use. To organize the outcomes of this review, the SDGs are classified into three groups, as per the three key pillars of sustainable development, particularly economy, environment, and society [131 ,132 ]. The classification into the three domains enables the authors to have an accurate overview of the overall areas that impact BESS utilization. We additionally presented the outcomes obtained by weighting the appropriateness of the evidence provided in every reference to evaluate an affinity (the interlinking) regarding the targets assessed (in percentage), as explained in the Methods section at the end of this study. The total impact in percentage base for each SDGs is illustrated by the lines in the Sankey diagram (see Fig. 4 ) in which the thick line mentions the high impact and the thin line indicates the low impact. An in-depth assessment of the BESS impacts on the three essential pillars or classes of sustainable development (economy, environment, and society), along with illustrative examples, are discussed in the following subsections. 3.1 BESS and environmental outcomes The batteries are recently associated with RE, electric vehicles, and other applications, which have led to the enhancement of environmental impacts, and can effectively contribute towards achieving the related SDGs. However, different researchers agreed that BESSs also have environmental disadvantages [134 ,135 ]. They incorporate poisonous and flammable materials in some situations and consume a significant amount of power for production which causes high GHG emissions [135] . Moreover, the transportation and manufacture of batteries release exhaust and other pollutants to the environment, which contribute to the GHG effect as well [135 ,136 ]. In this context, our assessment of relevant evidence indicates that within the environment group, 45 targets (45%) can benefit from the development and utilization of BESS, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . For instance, in SDG 13, on climate change, BESS can effectively act as a positive influence towards achieving 60% of its target. Moreover, based on the evidence, the BESS could act as an enabler towards achieving 40% and 17% of the SDG 14 and SDG 15 targets, respectively. The positive impact ratio (45%) would increase due to the continuous development of BESS and its application to cover many sectors together with addressing certain present limitations. Benefits from BESS for the environment group (SDG13, SDG14, and SDG15) can be summarized on its ability to reduce GHG from traditional fuels when it is used as a main part of RE to store energy [96] , with the improving state of BESS services, more countries are integrating climate change measures into their policies [100] , reducing pollution levels from marine activates, such as ships which use outdated power generation [111] , BESS, such as sodium-sulphur and flow battery are used to eliminate the high fluctuation of marine tidal current in creating a stable marine power supply while reducing the pollution level [112] , desalination [137] , and providing many other benefits to life, land, and water to maintain the ecosystem [138 ,139 ]. For instance, looking at Targets 13.1 and 13.2, which call for climate-related hazards and incorporate action on climate change into national strategies, strategies and planning; much evidence confirmed that the utilization of BESS associated with RE will help reduce CO2  emission in the power sector to around 70% by 2050 according to the plan published in the US [140] , New Zealand [141] , and Europe [142] . Meanwhile, 10 targets of the SDGs within the environment group, which represent 37%, may be affected negatively by the development and the utilization of BESS. Ultimately, their consideration is crucial. Thus, the BESS may act as an inhibitor for Target 13.1 which calls for climate-related hazards reduction. It can affect negatively because the BESS comprises materials with high environmental impacts [95] . Moreover, the batteries can cause human toxicity to reach a high level (66%) as proven by Üçtuğ et al. [94] . Furthermore, evidence confirms that BESS can negatively affect human health. For BESS, the negative effects related to human toxicity, ecotoxicity, and resource depletion are predominantly linked with copper, thallium, cobalt, silver, and nickel [46] . With respect to Target 13.2, which calls for enhancing the policies, strategies, and planning of climate change, evidence exists that the current policies of climate change have not taken the BESS into consideration although it has a high climate change impact potential [99 ,143 ]. Therefore, the impact of BESS on climate change policies and regulations must be considered. The batteries can act as inhibitors for Target 15.8 because the BESS and especially lithium-ion batteries can harm the ecosystem given that lithium extraction has considerable social and environmental consequences, particularly for water depletion and contamination. In addition, lithium is treated with toxic chemicals. These kinds of chemical overspill, leaching, or air emissions may, however, harm ecosystems, populations, and food production. Moreover, the extraction of lithium eventually affects the soil and creates air pollution [37] . Moreover, evidence exists that the factories of the lead-acid battery may cause heavy metal pollution for the surrounding agricultural ecosystems [13] . When depleted batteries are tossed into the trash, they end up in landfills where they decay and leak. As batteries corrode, their chemicals soak into soil and contaminate groundwater and surface water. The ecosystems, which contain thousands of aquatic plants and animals, are compromised when filled with battery chemicals. This means that by drinking from water faucets, the people could be ingesting dangerous metals. For instance, improperly disposed of lithium batteries can cause landfill fires that can smolder for many years. As a result, the toxic chemicals released into the air negatively affect our breathing and contribute to global warming. The vaporized form of improperly exposed batteries also gets trapped in the atmosphere and pollutes lakes and streams in the form of rain [144] .  3.2 BESS and social outcomes The development and utilization of BESS may also positively impact the attainment of several SDGs within the Society group. In this context, from 82 targets within this group, 33 targets (41%) can be benefited from the BESS, however, negative impacts are identified concerning 11 targets (14%), as seen in Fig. 6 . Based on the classification of the 17 SDGs into three groups, SDGs within the Society group include SDGs (1–7), SDG 11, and SDG 16. Looking at SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), evidence exists that the utilization and development of BESS will act as an enabler towards the achievement of all targets (100%) within this goal. Many studies support the implementation of BESS in pursuing a reliable, clean, and affordable modern energy service. BESS, associated with RE and also for electric vehicles (EV), has become more popular in replacing the use of conventional energy resources as it is more flexible in storing and providing power making it an affordable alternative in providing power [57] . With the decreasing cost of RE sources and an increasing scarcity of fossil fuels, a long-term solution is needed in which RE resources combined with BESS are able to ensure access to power supply for all [145] . Grid-connected with RE distribution generators and BESS is shown to be economically feasible over a 30-year life in ensuring clean and reliable energy services based on research made in Australia [146] . Major BESS disadvantage would be regarding its high capital funding but studies have shown that the cost can be covered over its operation time [147] . For example, regarding the fulfilment of Target 7.2, calling to boost the quota of RE in the global energy mix substantially, strong evidence exists that the BESS, included in Energy Storage Technologies and Energy System, has helped in increasing the demand for RE in the global energy mix and can contribute in achieving this target [148] . Research has also estimated an increase of stand-alone (with storage system) RE share in the energy market in 2020 to be at 5% compared with 2019 despite the current COVID-19 pandemic. This corresponds to an increase in demand for BESS for stationary and transport applications [60] . In terms of achieving Target 2.3, which aims to double the productivity of agricultural and incomes of small-scale food producers, BESS can play a positive role in this regard. Research in Germany has found that the deployment of semi-stationary energy storage (SES) and Solar PV in the agriculture sector, especially in rural/remote areas, is said to improve the sector productivity while reducing the need of grid extension to the areas [49] . Moreover, to achieve SDG 4 especially Targets 4.1–4.3, the BESS can act as an enabler for quality education. For instance, a study in Tagzirt, Morocco reveals the utilization of BESS-based hybrid RE for powering up the rural area. This has helped improve the education level of the community with the energy system able to supply power to the local school while maintaining better economic and environmental values in the community [149] . BESS-based hybrid RE is also used in Ethiopia [30]  and west China [104] , where this system is able to provide enough power to the students day and night, and this is important for the village community that is previously without BESS-based hybrid RE, and no electricity during the night which compels students to have a revision on their education, but with BESS-based hybrid RE, the students can now have enough time to study and provide a greater impact on the local development. One more example, the continuous growth, development, and applications of BESS led to the rise in the number of factories and the prosperity of the battery industry and trade, which in turn created new jobs and accelerated economic development [150]  (Target 4.4). Moreover, for SDG 11, much published evidence exists about the positive role of BESS alone or associated with other RE services in developing eco-friendly public transport, such as electric bus, EV, and solar car [151] . They are also being used in developing smart cities, which means the city's systems, such as public transport and infrastructure have been integrated into one operated main system. This subsequently helps in maintaining a sustainable transport system for all [42] . With the current state of technology, BESS density and efficiency has helped toward affordable electric vehicles with very low environmental pollution. With the development of high-performance batteries, EVs will become the main means of transportation for people [42 ,152 ]. Meanwhile, pieces of evidence show that the BESS utilization and development may act as an inhibitor towards achieving some targets or sub-targets within the Society group, including 1.2,2.3,3.4,3.9,5.5,6.6,6.7,7.3,11.5,11.6,11.10, and 16.2. However, no negative impact was found within SDG 4, as shown in Fig. 6 . In this context, for example, looking at Target 3.9, which calls to decrease the diseases and deaths related to toxic substances and pollution of air, soil, and water, BESS, such as lead-acid batteries may act as an inhibitor for this target, given that lead can cause memory loss, decrease concentration, and damage the reproductive system. Nerve disorders, high blood pressure, and joint and muscle pain are widely believed to be caused by lead. Researchers suspect that Ludwig van Beethoven succumbed to lead intoxication [85] . In addition, batteries, such as Lithium-ion batteries may release substantial amounts of toxic gases that can cause severe irritation to the nasal passage, skin, and eyes when overheated [76] . All these harmful consequences can negatively affect the achievement of Target 3.4. However, by considering BESS as a part of RES, there are weak evidence relating it with this target (3.4). Research has shown that one of the major problems that healthcare centers face, especially in rural/remote areas would be the absence of reliable electricity services [77 ,153 ]. This affects the high maternal and premature mortality rates in a less developed country. But through usage of stand-alone hybrid energy system-based BESS, a high reliability power supply can be created which will increase the effectiveness of healthcare delivery in rural/remote areas. One more example is related to Targets 6.6 and 6.7 in which evidence shows the high rate of BESS disposal and recycling may affect the water-related ecosystems. Thus, BESS may negatively affect the ecosystems, including bodies of water with different degrees and the environment within 12 categories of effect (global warming, water footprint, abiotic depletion [fossil fuel], abiotic depletion, human toxicity, ozone layer depletion, terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, acidification, photochemical oxidation, and eutrophication) [154] . Batteries of different sizes and forms are regarded as one of the appropriate energy storage approaches and extensive studies are available for various battery applications and technologies; however, the negative impacts of large-scale battery use on human health and the environment (Targets 11.5 and 11.6) remain a major challenge. The life of BESS is limited; massive quantities and various raw materials, including metals and non-metals, are utilized to manufacture batteries. Thus, in the battery industry, giant quantities of environmental pollution can be generated (e.g., toxic gases, hazardous waste, and GHG emissions) at various stages inclusive of manufacturing, mining, transportation, use, storage, remedy, recycling, and disposal [18 ,63 ].  3.3 BESS and economic outcomes The remaining group or category of SDGs, those relevant to the Economy, is described in Fig. 7  . The five SDGs within the Economy group are relevant to decent work, industry, economic growth, reduced inequality, innovation and infrastructure, responsible consumption and production, and partnerships to achieve the goal (SDGs 8, 9, 10, 12, and 17, respectively). With respect to this group, we have identified that the BESS could positively affect achieving 30 targets (50%) out of 60 targets within this group. It was discovered that the widespread and different applications of the BESS offer economic opportunities from using direct labor from remote communities, local materials and enterprises, local owners, and local banks’ services. Looking at SDG 8, economic growth and decent work, current studies demonstrate that the prosperity in the trade and industry of batteries in addition to its multiple applications, especially in the field of RE, irrigation, EV, and electric buses, contributes to creating economic development and jobs in manufacturing, trading, distribution, and so on. The achievement of Target 8.3 can benefit from BESS to create new jobs. For instance, based on the study introduced by [27] , in Middle Eastern countries, by introducing the RE into their energy sector, especially Solar/Wind/BESS hybrid power systems, approximately 180,000 direct jobs will be opened for the domestic people by 2050. BESS which has been used in a stand-alone system, especially in the rural areas which are not electrified yet, will positively impact creating job opportunities. Research by Rio et al. [118]  uncovered that young local people, especially in the rural area, will benefit from having a stand-alone system with BESS utilized as the project opened job opportunities for them thus reducing the unemployed youth rate and help increase the income per capita (Target 8.6). Job opportunities created will also help the local youth in having more education and higher job rate as most of the projects will target domestic workers for their operation [81] , which positively impact Targets 8.1 and 8.3. Looking at Target 9.1 which calls to develop reliable, quality, and sustainable infrastructures to support human wellbeing and economic development, the BESS can act positively towards achieving this target [155] . For example, research in Sub-Saharan Africa has shown that utilizing sustainable BESS for solar home systems in rural areas has shown improvement in terms of the area infrastructure and support the local social, environmental, and economic developments across Sub-Saharan Africa [121] . Research in Sheffield, UK has also shown that utilizing energy storage systems (ESS) with their urban tram system can improve their tram infrastructure and savings in their energy and basic CO2  emissions. Thus, the ESS can be used for future infrastructure upgrades while improving the life quality of people living in Sheffield [106] . With the exponential growth of technology, BESS has improved significantly over the years which helps the energy industry. As proved by P. Sokolnikova et al. [156]  has shown that the combination of ESS and RE for Siberian rural communities has helped them in providing reliable power services to the community giving them the chance to improve the community's life quality in terms of the technological, social, and economic sectors. ESS has also helped enhance telecommunication technology networks in rural areas by functioning as a mobile hybrid base station to provide power for telecommunication networks to work [119] . This will significantly improve the technological capabilities and education level for people especially in developing countries that are out of reach to their country's main power network [119 ,157 ]. BESS has also been used to enhance RE production in upgrading the current source technological capabilities and becoming more effective with multiple models, such as by using the “Load shifting” method or optimization through linear programming (LP) approach [158] , which may contribute towards achieving Target 9.3. Many pieces of evidence were found from our search to confirm that the RE will positively impact innovation, industry, and infrastructure (SDG 9). With respect to SDG 12, especially Target 12.5, which calls to substantially minimize waste generation by reduction, recycling, and re-use, evidence exists that supports the positive impact of BESS on this target goal. Based on studies, BESSs are either recycled, disposed of, or their materials will be recovered based on their uses [73] . Recycling the material in LIB (aluminium, nickel, cobalt, lithium) can lead to a reduction in energy requirements by 10–53% and lower the cost of making new lithium-oxygen batteries (LOB) from 1870 MJ/kWh to 1510 MJ/kWh which leads to lower GHG impacts [15 ,79 ,159 ,160 ]. Research by Dewulf et al. indicates that recycling battery components can lower the fossil resource consumption therefore reducing waste generation [161] . This is further backed by the study of Dunn et al. [162] , which indicates the whole battery greenhouse gas emissions and waste can be reduced by up to 50% when recycled cathode, copper, and aluminium are used in the new LIB ESS. Moreover, concerning SDG 17, the BESS may help achieve some targets within this goal, such as strengthen domestic resource mobilization as the diversity of BESS applications are being apply everywhere, including in developing countries [163] , improving the global partnership for sustainable development as the BESS sector witnessed global collaboration in terms of research, financial support, and economic aspects [164 ,165 ]. As an example of the positive impact of BESS on Target 17.1, which calls to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, a research has found that developing countries, such as Brazil that has abundant aluminum resources to produce batteries, has cooperated with developed countries, such as Russia [166] . Based also on [166] , processing workshops and manufacturers have been established by the developed countries in Brazil that help boost the country's economy and infrastructures. In sum, as expected, the battery value chain sustains 10 million additional secure, fair, and good-quality jobs worldwide in 2030, of which over 50% are in emerging economies [15 ,167 ]. Meanwhile, fewer targets within the Economy group (three targets, 5%) can be impacted negatively by the utilization of BESS. Therefore, BESS may act as an inhibitor towards achieving a few targets or sub-targets within the Economy group, including Targets 8.1, 9.2, and 12.4. However, no negative impact was found within SDG 10 and SDG 17, as shown in Fig. 7 . In this context, as for example, looking at Target 8.1, which calls to sustain the economic growth per capita, research in Germany indicates that the prospect of employment and economic gains from utilizing BESS-based hybrid RE are quite limited and significantly dependent on the level of subsidy rate leading to very small benefits or none in economic growth with the utilization of BESS [168] . Bauhman et al. [169]  unveiled that by utilizing the normalized load profile of grid-connected lithium-ion batteries (LIB ESS) in assessing its carbon footprint (in kgCO2eq /kWh), the use phase of LIB ESS has contributed up to 60–95% of carbon impact during power service which is not ideal. Another research made by Hittinger et al. [170]  focuses on the bulk storage aspect of LIB ESS in 20 sites across the USA and that the deployment of the ESS will cause a net increase in CO2  emissions during the in-use phase which will increase the economic load (Target 12.4).  3.4 Towards sustainable utilization of BESS As mentioned above, currently, the accelerated deployment of BESS and its multiple uses have been motivated primarily by various goals (drivers), including the advancement of economic growth, enhancing the security of energy, enhancing access to electricity, and alleviating climate change [171] . BESSs have enormous potential: they are the crucial technology to acquire the Paris Agreement [172] , new jobs and substantial economic value can be created and could boost access to energy [173] . For instance, as explained in Fig. 2 (a ), the BESS can achieve 100% of the SDG Target 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), especially BESS associated with RE and EV. However, towards sustainable BESS utilization, the BESS must address some limitations and its negative impact, especially on the environment, should be mitigated (illustrated in Fig. 2  (b ) based on the published evidence). Generally, the BESS sustainable expansion provides many environmental, economic, and social benefits. However, this cannot be done without an aggressive change from the current trajectory of development which requires coordinated, immediate actions by investors, companies, policymakers, investors, and stakeholders. To initiate this change, some clear steps should be achieved to develop the BESS and accelerate sustainable technology and business growth which are:• Increase the share of energy efficiency measures and REs in the BESS.  • Accelerate the rollout of the infrastructure of intelligent charging to allow the transition from smooth economic to sustainable mobility.  • Change the rule and standard of battery enabled RE as a dispatchable electricity source for the power grid.  • Scale-up electrical pooled and shared mobility.  • Support BESS deployment for energy access.  • Ensuring consistent productivity, transparency, and performance on the basis of established BESS sustainability standards and principles.    In addition, road transport emissions as an example account for 5.8 GtCO2 e per year [3 ,174 ]. Depending on the power mix, EVs in use presently emit 30–60% fewer emissions than combustion engines [3] . Besides decarbonization, bringing electricity to around 850 million people without electricity access will improve productivity, livelihood, and health substantially, which can contribute to achieving many SDG targets [3 ,175 ]. Moreover, deployment of BESS in the power grid, electrification, and transportation should be increased. To do so, energy utilities, public policymakers, and financial institutions along with battery manufacturers, must advance the deployment and design of affordable BESS applications (SDGs 7, 9, and 17). Moreover, to reduce the environmental negative effect of batteries, policymakers must lay out guidelines, standards, and regulation on the basis of life cycle emissions [171] . Based on the life cycle considerations, private sector companies must commit to verified GHG disclosure (SDG 13). As aforementioned, BESS can contribute towards achieving many targets of the 17 SDGs and can provide multiple long-term benefits, including job creation, energy security, economic prospects, environmental development, and global warming prevention [176 ,177 ]. However, no clear vision exists in this regard across the world especially in terms of economic support (SDG 8) to date. The reason may be is that no noteworthy causal link exists between BESS and total factor productivity (TFP) growth [178]  (Target 8.2). Moreover, the BESS, EV, and HEV integration into the electrical grid still suffers from the existence of unique standards across the globe to regulate its connection efficiently towards secure, reliable, and economic integration [179] . Moreover, the BESS strategic policy in transportation or in the power sector shall cover four key aims: security of energy, social equity, economic benefits, and environmental protection [180] .   4 Conclusion and recommendations Electro-mobility, especially in combination with renewable energy, is an important contribution towards addressing global mobility needs. Looking beyond transport, the entire energy system is undergoing a systemic transformation. By 2050, wind and solar energy are expected to account for 50% of global power generation. In line with this, battery energy storage systems (BESS) are a core technology underpinning the shift to energy decarbonization and transport systems, and could be a game changer in efforts to curb climate change as well as achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Therefore, this study is conducted to present and discuss implications of how BESS can either enable or inhibit the delivery of all 17 goals and 169 targets recognized in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this assessment, the 17 SDGs were divided into three groups, including environment, society, and economy as per the three key pillars of sustainable development. To achieve the objectives of this study, an expert elicitation method-based consensus is used. The results have shown that the BESS can positively affect the achievement of 60 targets (35.5%) of all SDGs, but it may negatively impact the accomplishment of 22 targets which represent 13.1% of all targets. Within the three groups of SDGs, the development and utilization of BESS can positively affect the achievement of 12 targets (45%), while negatively affect the achievement of 10 targets (37%) of the SDG targets within this group. The technological advantages provided by the BESS may also have a positive impact on the achievement of a number of SDGs within the Society group. We have identified benefits from BESS on 33 targets (41%) from these SDGs, whereas negative impacts are reported in 11 targets (14%). Thirty targets (50%) within the Economy group could potentially benefit from BESS-based technologies. However, Fewer targets in the Economy group can be impacted negatively by BESS (3 targets, 5%) than the ones with positive impact. For the rest, no pieces of evidence are found. However, with the current development and exponential growth of BESS shares along with addressing certain present limitations, these impacts may cover additional targets in the future. This study concluded that although BESS holds many advantages, the use of BESS may act as an inhibitor with many targets within the environmental and social groups compared with the economic group (only 5%). The reasons are as follows:• The extraction of raw materials utilized in BESS may entail considerable environmental and social cost [181] . For instance, about 2/3 of cobalt in the world comes from Congo and approximately 20% is envisioned to be associated with child labor and insecure operating conditions [182] ;  • Battery production, recycling, and degradation entail a wide carbon footprint [183] ; and  • The lack of coordination and efficient financing schemes seems to hamper the development of BESS to bring low priced, clean power to middle- and low-income nations [184] .    Consequently, key changes to the full BESS value chain are required to enable BESS to support the sustainable development of energy and mitigate climate change. Working together today is important to create a sustainable foundation for tomorrow's energy and transport systems. This calls for three main objectives to be accomplished:• To transparent and stable raw material supply chains should be secure and open, characterized by fair working circumstances and mutual prosperity. This involves aligning regulations and insurance plans, in addition to mobilizing mixed funding to solve some issues and challenges, such as child labor.  • To unlock the capacity of batteries to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement of climate change, a circular, low-carbon, and pollution-free value chain must be considered.  • To bring energy, development, and productivity to a billion people in intermediate and low incomes countries, the full potential of BESSs must be unleashed.    To attain these objectives, the following three recommendations must be considered:• Clear and firm commitments and coalitions of public, non-public, and civil society organizations consenting to align investments. The goal is to evolve and promote requirements and standards for the sustainable and responsible supply of lithium and cobalt chains.  • Fundamental improvements to the full battery value chain are needed to allow batteries to power sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Collaborative action is required today to develop a sustainable backbone for the energy and transport systems of tomorrow.  • A circular, low-carbon and pollution-free value chain must be created to unlock the potential for batteries to contribute to the realization of the 2015 Paris Agreement.  • Evaluate the circular economy possibilities for batteries. Multiple action collaborations must be identified to determine sustainable requirements for battery design and lower transaction costs for reuse and recycling of EV battery, and  • Encourage current commitments in middle and low-income countries to improve BESS and the electrification of transport.    Therefore, towards sustainable BESS development and towards achieving more SDG targets, these recommendations may be taken into consideration while negative impacts and limitations of BESS should be addressed.
