                  In this article, we have reviewed how the women of Bangladesh are negatively exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of quality education, employment loss, labour market contribution, domestic violence, and health and wellness, thus putting their lives at more significant risk. We have employed the Drivers-Pressures-States-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to analyze the gendered effects of COVID-19 on some specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Bangladesh. We have purposively selected five SDGs, SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), and SDG 8 (decent work & economic growth), those have direct effects on women's livelihood and well-being. Our DPSIR framework analysis has shown that gendered vulnerabilities have been exacerbated due to the COVID-19 situation with multiple pre-existing socio-cultural norms and various state policies like patriarchal values, stay-home policies etc. As SDG 1 focuses on poverty reduction, and SDG 8 focuses on decent work and economic growth, unemployment, losing job opportunities and economic downturn due to the pandemic have slowed down national growth as well as increased poverty in the country. With excessive pressure on the health sector to deal with COVID-19, women’s essential maternal, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services were neglected and health disparities were also observed. Thus, many women and adolescent girls could not access SRH services when needed that led to a myriad of consequences for SDG 3 achievements. The prolonged shutdown of educational institutes resulted in mass school dropouts, mental health problems, and higher risks of child labour and child marriage among girl children which has significant negative impacts on the achievement of SDG 4. Due to COVID-19-related preventive measures, such as social distancing, and lockdown, women have been involved to do more care and household job following traditional gender roles, experienced work from home, and a ‘shadow pandemic’ domestic violence amidst the COVID-19. Consequently, the overall gender gap has increased (SDG 5). We have argued that the existing neoliberal market economy has failed to save the global society from a pandemic, therefore, it is important to rethink its development targets and indicators. Moreover, a paradigm shift is recommended by deconstructing present economic systems to build a resilient society based on the caring relationships among nature, humans, and society embracing an ecofeminist perspective.

In this article, we have reviewed how the women of Bangladesh are negatively exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of quality education, employment loss, labour market contribution, domestic violence, and health and wellness, thus putting their lives at more significant risk. We have employed the Drivers-Pressures-States-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to analyze the gendered effects of COVID-19 on some specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Bangladesh. We have purposively selected five SDGs, SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), and SDG 8 (decent work & economic growth), those have direct effects on women's livelihood and well-being. Our DPSIR framework analysis has shown that gendered vulnerabilities have been exacerbated due to the COVID-19 situation with multiple pre-existing socio-cultural norms and various state policies like patriarchal values, stay-home policies etc. As SDG 1 focuses on poverty reduction, and SDG 8 focuses on decent work and economic growth, unemployment, losing job opportunities and economic downturn due to the pandemic have slowed down national growth as well as increased poverty in the country. With excessive pressure on the health sector to deal with COVID-19, women’s essential maternal, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services were neglected and health disparities were also observed. Thus, many women and adolescent girls could not access SRH services when needed that led to a myriad of consequences for SDG 3 achievements. The prolonged shutdown of educational institutes resulted in mass school dropouts, mental health problems, and higher risks of child labour and child marriage among girl children which has significant negative impacts on the achievement of SDG 4. Due to COVID-19-related preventive measures, such as social distancing, and lockdown, women have been involved to do more care and household job following traditional gender roles, experienced work from home, and a ‘shadow pandemic’ domestic violence amidst the COVID-19. Consequently, the overall gender gap has increased (SDG 5). We have argued that the existing neoliberal market economy has failed to save the global society from a pandemic, therefore, it is important to rethink its development targets and indicators. Moreover, a paradigm shift is recommended by deconstructing present economic systems to build a resilient society based on the caring relationships among nature, humans, and society embracing an ecofeminist perspective.   Keywords COVID-19 pandemic  Bangladesh  Gendered effect  DPSIR framework  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Ecofeminist perspective    1 Introduction Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 disease has turned the world into a place of morbidity, mortality, and mourning. Initially, it emerged as a health problem, but gradually this disease has brought a planetary disaster that exacerbated and transformed the whole global system. The emergence of COVID-19, its spread, and the failure to manage the condition with resilience planning have exposed us to the pandemic vulnerabilities with economic inequality and social insecurity in all walks of life. The world has seen how market mechanisms, market-based economic and profit-making systems have collapsed with COVID-19 infections and related preventive measures like closures, lockdowns, and shutdowns. Many scholars have argued that neoliberal market economic systems mainly focus on profit-making, thus, people’s health and well-being have always been considered nothing but a commodity which has been done through the privatization of health care and medical services. Eventually, it created a disastrous world condition by giving birth to a neoliberal disease like COVID-19. The whole world has suffered the result of this disease at the same time the neoliberal system has been proven unfit to handle this situation [1–3 ]. Critical scholars also argued that while COVID-19 is a by-product of the neoliberal economy, and this neoliberal disease is responsible for socio-economic-political transformation, it is time to rethink neoliberal plans, policies, and approaches [1–4 ]. For example, sustainable development goals (SDGs) for low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In the pre-COVID-19 situation, the SDGs were adopted and followed as global goals to progress universally towards ending poverty and prosperity, ensuring equality and peace [5 ,6 ]. As part of the COVID-19 recovery, the government of different countries as well as various financial aid agencies have already offered stimulus packages, monetary supports and other structural adjustments to many LMICs. However, a fundamental question has been raised simultaneously, should we run after the same neoliberal strategies that have given the burden of fatal disease on our shoulders? Should not we still think of a system capable of protecting the entire global society? With the questions above, we have set our primary objective of this paper to identify the gender effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the SDGs of an LMIC which is Bangladesh. To conduct this review, firstly, we have used DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts, Responses) framework. Secondly, we have proposed ecofeminist perspectives as an alternative to neoliberal global systems, which emphasize care, equality, and equity-based social structure, i.e., gender and race, by posing nature as the base. As this review has pointed out COVID-19 as a neoliberal disease, a byproduct of the profit-based market economic system, it is noteworthy to remind that the conservation of nature is the central belief in ecofeminist theories instead of destroying it for endless business profit. The essence of ecofeminism embraces gender inequality, feminism, and ecology altogether emphasizing restoring a balanced relationship between humans and nature without damaging their dependence [7 ,8 ]. Therefore, ecofeminists want to establish a functional unity between nature and human society. Ecofeminists (often named materialistic/socialist ecofeminists) are, hence, critical of globalization as it extends capitalist development projects through multi-national companies to every corner of the globe [8 ]. Vandana Shiva has been fighting against industrial agriculture and genetically modified crops that destroy biodiversity and impose monoculture-based agriculture through patented seeds of multinational corporations. These seeds and farming systems degrade soil nutrients, destroy local or indigenous knowledge of agriculture, make farmers dependent on multinational corporations for seeds, and finally, reduce women’s involvement in agriculture including marginalized communities [9 ]. Ecofeminism seeks to understand the connection between women's oppression and the destruction of nature in the patriarchal capitalist world, thus, believes that the domination of women in a patriarchal society and the domination of nature through the Western idea of 'development' happened in the same way [8 ]. Although, Bina Agarwal, a Feminist Environmentalist, argues that ecofeminists often place all Third World women in a homogeneous category and such categorization fails to identify the existing differences (e.g., race, caste, class) among women. Moreover, gendered oppression is not the only form of exploitation in Third World countries [10 ]. According to her, when ecofeminists argue that the destruction of nature and the oppression of women are the outcome of colonization and the Western model of development, the pre-existing social inequalities are not considered here [9 ]. In her Feminist Environmentalist stand, Agarwal wants to indicate structural causes of environmental destruction and the relationship pattern between nature and human beings, irrespective of gender identity, that is deeply rooted in their material reality [10 ]. Nevertheless, we would like to argue by discussing Shiva’s recent work on coronavirus [11 ] that Shiva’s ecofeminism captures material reality as well as structural causes of environmental destruction profoundly and of course philosophically. According to Shiva, coronavirus is a consequence of war; a war against life and the virus originated and spread out in a neoliberal market economic system [11 ]. While human being would like to establish an industrialised, globalised market economy, they separate human beings and nature, claims the superiority of human being over nature, established ownership, manipulation and control over nature by destroying natural biodiversity, and ecosystems, as well as invading their habitats [11 ]. So, material causes are present in the system for the birth and spread of the coronavirus. Although many articles have focused on the effects of COVID-19 on the SDGs, to date, no article has been found that analyzed SDGs through a gender lens using a DPSIR framework for any of the LMICs. Both authors believe that stimulus packages and/or structural adjustments proposed by various governments and aid agencies as a pathway for LMICs’ socioeconomic recovery from the devastating effects of COVID-19 are inadequate. Therefore, the authors have argued for a paradigm shift, a deconstructive approach, nature, and care-based ecofeminist perspectives for future Bangladesh and the global society.  2 Empirical case study: Bangladesh Bangladesh is a densely populated country (168.107 million, 1265 per sq. km.) in South Asia [12 ,13 ] and one of the top most COVID-19 affected countries in the world with 20.0 million + COVID-19 infected cases and 29440 death cases [13 ]. To date, approximately 87.87% of Bangladeshis completed 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, while 74.76% of Bangladeshis have completed 2nd dose of the vaccine. Approximately, 51.23% of Bangladeshis completed the 3rd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine [14 ]. At present government is planning for a fourth dose of the vaccination program. Since the onset of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh on March 8th,  2020 onwards, the healthcare system has experienced an unprecedented crisis and challenges in managing patients, especially during the peak infection periods. Many public and private hospitals and clinics dedicatedly provided treatment services to COVID-19-infected patients [15 ]. During the second and third wave of COVID-19, May 2021 onwards, the delta variant of COVID-19 remained the main concern for the country, and from July to August 2021, almost all the patients were infected with the variant [16 ]. In late 2021, Omnicorn, a South African variant, became a new concern, leading to the third wave of the pandemic [17 ]. However, despite many new variants, due to intensive vaccination programs as well as preventive measures, infection severity and death rate were low. During the first wave of COVID-19, Bangladesh observed a nationwide "lockdown" intermittently as restrictive measures to curb infection [18 ] while other non-clinical measures were also followed as suggested by WHO, including wearing masks, hand washing, social distancing to reduce the infection rate. However, widespread irregularity and inefficiency were observed all over the country regarding planning and managing the disease. Especially combating the disease with a limited and scarce supply of essential COVID-19 treatment services such as sample testing, intensive care unit (ICU), oxygen supply, ventilators, hospital beds, trained health care professionals etc. [19 ,20 ]. Thus, tremendous societal and economic inequality has been observed in the treatment processes. People from upper socioeconomic status were in a privileged position to spend more money on coronavirus diagnosis than people from poorer socioeconomic status [20 ], which, no doubt, has helped the rich to receive fast and timely treatment services. Moreover, wealthy people had the advantage to use power and social connections to ensure quality treatments, hospital beds, oxygen, and ventilators, that were unimaginable for the poor [19 ]. Discrimination in the treatment process due to geographical variation was also observed between small and large cities. Metropolitan cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet were able to offer more well-equipped diagnosis and treatment services than the small towns [20 ]. In addition to health aspects, like in other developing countries, the socioeconomic disruption caused by COVID-19 was also devastating for Bangladeshi nationals. Many Bangladeshi people had been exposed to socioeconomic vulnerabilities, a deeper state of poverty, widespread violation of human rights, and authoritarian repression by ruling parties to establish preventive measures in people's everyday lives [5 ,21 ,22 ]. These aspects have, undoubtedly, affected everyone's lives and livelihoods, especially, the marginal people [23 ,24 ]. Thus, a terrible spectacle of social injustice was observed at various socioeconomic levels. One of the most vulnerable examples can be the country's readymade garment (RMG) sector. A research report by International Labour Organization (ILO) showed that within the first wave of COVID-19, foreign exports from top exporting countries in Asia dropped by up to 70% [26 ]. While worldwide supply chain, trade, and commerce were stopped and halted, many factories dismissed workers or reduced workforces. Due to the shutdown of many industries, many RMG workers have fallen into poverty by losing their employment that had been identified RMG industry workers as the most vulnerable victims of the COVID-19 pandemic [26 ]. However, this was the case not only for RMG workers but also for other marginalized communities like farmers, day labourers, indigenous peoples, and women [23 ,24 ]. So far, the gendered effects of COVID-19 in Bangladesh are no exception from any other countries in the South. Evidence shows that Bangladeshi men are more affected by this disease than women, and women's experience around this pandemic also differs from that of men, especially working-class women [27 ,28 ]. A substantial number of employment drops had caused a devastating financial crisis across working women worldwide so in Bangladesh. Women lost more jobs than men and returned to typical household and carer jobs based on gender roles [29 ,30 ]. The women who used to work in an office environment got habituated to maintaining a home-office often interrupted by household members and responsibilities as well as extended working hours while coping with lockdowns. On the other hand, women of lower socioeconomic classes lost their jobs, experienced debt, and struggled to make ends meet [28 ]. Many had left the cities and migrated to the villages [31 ,32 ]. Bangladeshi women from different socioeconomic statuses experienced constant pressure to adopt "new realities" both in urban and rural locations. The economic repercussions resulted in a lower female labour force in the market and increased financial vulnerabilities among women [21 ], which not only affected gender relations and the progress toward gender equality but also has a long-term effect on the global economy and society. Outside social and economic effects, like other countries, a shadow pandemic, violence against women by intimate partners was also appeared before Bangladeshi women amidst COVID-19 [33 ]. Thus, women's psychological stress and anxiety related to the disease increased the loads of household and care works [25–34 ] coupled with domestic violence which put them in a more vulnerable state than men. According to Hamadani et al. [35 ], movement restrictions due to the year-long lockdown have created more significant financial, social, psychosocial, and physical risks to them and the well-being of their families. The effects of the pandemic on the women's lives and work of developing countries like Bangladesh would have a long-term socioeconomic impact to tackle. Undoubtedly, the socioeconomic downfall would affect the SDGs, the successors of the Millennium Development Goals [36 ], and their associated targets in Bangladesh. Before COVID-19, Bangladesh was moving forward to achieve SDGs with some of its targets. The current epidemic has abruptly halted the journey toward these goals and hampered the successes and progress achieved in the past decades. In this article, we have reviewed the gendered effects of COVID-19 on some selected SDGs. Therefore, we have chosen five SDGs purposively among the 17 SDGs. Even though all of the SDGs are intertwined and affect one another, these five SDGs are directly related to gender (Fig. 1  ) as well as have profound impacts on women and the development of Bangladesh, especially, when COVID-19 is present in our lives. The SDGs are as follows:SDG 1: No poverty  SDG 3: Good health and well-being  SDG 4: Inclusive and quality education and learning opportunities  SDG 5: Gender equality and empowering all women and girls  SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth     3 Review methodologies 3.1 Literature search To conduct this review, the authors have searched journal articles on the gendered effects of COVID-19 impact on the SDGs of Bangladesh. The following databases were searched for their extensive resources initially: Elsevier (www.sciencedirect.com ) (n = 107), Emerald (http://www.emeraldinsight.com ) (n = 47), Taylor & Francis (https://www.tandfonline.com ) (n = 63), Springer (https://link.springer.com/ ) (n = 99) database. In addition, we have also searched google and google scholar for relevant literature. The main keywords for our search were "gendered impact", "COVID-19", "SDGs", and "Bangladesh". We have further filtered our search by keywords such as specific SDG targets of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8 such as poverty, economic growth, unemployment, work opportunities, work environment, maternal health, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), school closure and education, child marriage, gender equality, domestic violence in association with COVID-19 in the title, keywords and abstracts. Furthermore, national documents such as the 8th 5-year plan, and stimulus documents from government organizations, NGOs, and international donor agencies, were also searched using Google and Google scholar. We have mainly included articles and documents relevant to Bangladesh and developing countries concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. After screening duplication, title, abstract and keywords 40 articles were selected to analyze the DPSIR framework. All the retrieved articles (n = 40) and other supporting documents were indexed in Endnote for review. n = 276 articles were excluded from the review. The main exclusion criteria were irrelevant articles, i.e. articles that were not directly related to SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8 and their targets, other SDGs, other countries, out of scope, non-English and review articles. The literature review identified the driving forces, pressures, states, impacts, and responses for the selected SDGs and developed a framework to establish linkages with each component concerning COVID-19 (Fig. 2  ).  3.2 DPSIR framework The DPSIR framework, initially developed by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in the late 1980s for ocean ecosystem management, is a framework of a continuous feedback process [37 ]. This framework analyses, documents, and reports environmental problems and contains five aspects: "drivers" or the driving forces (D) are commonly recognized as the socioeconomic or cultural factors based on individual or social needs and, in turn, advance to various human activities [38 ,39 ]. Consequently, the conceptual framework explains drivers (D) (human needs) create "pressures" (P) on human activities. The activities alter the socioeconomic or environmental "states" (S) in negative trends. Subsequently, the negative socioeconomic or cultural environment causes an "impact" (I) on human well-being [40 ]. Finally, decision-makers and policymakers endorse "response/s" (R) to modify/mitigate the impacts through guidelines, public policy formulation, creating interventions, and alternative opportunities in the cycle that may affect human well-being [37 ]. This framework can develop scenarios, identify linkages and interconnectedness among specific problems, and suggest strategic responses to socioeconomic, legal, and policy instruments or technological devices [37 ]. DPSIR framework has been previously used in further research in Bangladesh, such as water, sanitation, salinity, and maternal health [41 ], as well as rapid strategic environmental assessment of biomedical waste management during COVID-19 [42 ]. This article reviewed the gendered effects of COVID-19 on selected SDGs in the areas of poverty situation of Bangladesh, economic growth and decent work opportunities, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, and domestic violence using the DPSIR framework and their interconnections to identify possible pressures, states, impacts, and relevant responses (Fig. 3  ). Therefore, COVID-19 is presented as the main driving force along with other existing factors for the gendered effect. How is COVID-19 along with other socioeconomic issues creating pressures on SDG 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8? How the activities related to COVID-19 are altering the socioeconomic or cultural environmental states in negative trends of achieving the above-mentioned SDGs? Subsequently, what are the negative socioeconomic or cultural environmental impacts of COVID-19 on gender? What should be the policy of the government as a response? In the following sections, the DPSIR analysis of the gendered effects of COVID-19 and their impacts on the SDGs are discussed based on the above questions.   4 DPSIR analysis: gendered effects of COVID-19 and their impact on SDGs 4.1 Effect on poverty (SDG 1), decent work, and economic growth (SDG 8) According to a report by UN Women [33 ], due to the coronavirus pandemic and its effects, 96 million people would experience extreme poverty, and 47 million of them are women and girls [34 ]. On the other hand, more than half a billion people will be further pushed to extreme poverty as they have to bear health expenses out of their pockets [43 ]. Unquestionably, this state of extreme poverty would be a reversing journey against the progress of the world's poverty alleviation over the last decades, which would also widen the targeted gender poverty gap between men and women. Before the pandemic, 20.5% of Bangladeshi people lived below the poverty line. This percentage has been raised to 40.9% due to the pandemic, adding another 20 million 'new poor' in the country [6 ,44 ]. Nevertheless, the economic downturn, slower GDP growth rate, and export trading also soared in poverty during this pandemic period. Since the lockdown policy was undertaken disorderly and indistinctly, often forced, and sustained for many months in Bangladesh, the governmental efforts failed to support people in need or when unemployed. According to a survey, 75% of respondents reported not having adequate food at home, and 91% could not buy food due to not having enough money. Reductions in employment during the initial lockdown period of 2020 remarkably increased food insecurity [33 ]. This situation affected women badly. Approximately 91.8% of people working in the informal sector of Bangladesh are women. A substantial portion of the domestic workers, day labourers, and cleaners are women who have lost their income during the lockdown and did not return to employment [45 ]. Revenues of women working in the informal sector have declined dramatically during the lockdown and after [46 ]. Furthermore, the World Bank's Bangladesh Poverty Assessment report [47 ] emphasized the RMG sector significantly pushes the continued decline in urban poverty. With 61% women engagement, Bangladesh's RMG sector is recognized as a significant source of women empowerment and gender equality despite a monthly minimum wage is Tk 8000 ($95), one of the lowest payments in the global garments supply chain [43 ]. Yet RMG sector in Bangladesh is considered as women's formal income generation source that is widely acknowledged as an accelerating factor for women's authority and power in family decision-making, reducing vulnerability, and improving savings behaviour. As many factories closed during the first wave of COVID-19 without paying wages, orders worth USD 3.17 billion had been cancelled or suspended, compromising millions of female workers' financial security [48 ]. The RMG sector, one of Bangladesh's highest GDP earning sources, has resulted in the loss of around one million jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 70% of workers remained unemployed even after a year [49 ]. Since the pandemic has prolonged an economic crisis, unemployment raised substantially, undermined social safety nets, and threatened the health and social insecurity [50 ]. Moreover, ILO [26 ] reported that the impact of COVID-19 has aggravated female 'labourer' status in the RMG sector with growing discrimination and harassment. It has also suppressed women's voices while increasing wage gaps [21 ]. Besides, the fear of unemployment, economic shock, losing savings, and incapability to support families are also evident among RMG workers [51 ]. In the family environment, long-standing family inequality, care, and obligations have also added reasons to worsen their conditions. All these, after all, would contribute to the rising scarcity of skilled, dependable, and trained workers in the RMG sector [21 ], as well as increasing poverty among women [46 ]. Thus, COVID-19 has significant adverse effects on Bangladeshi women in terms of labour market contribution, decreased wages, and putting their lives at greater risk. While this is the reality, achieving productive and decent work opportunities for all women and men by 2030 following the principle of "leave no one behind" seems unrealistic [52 ]. Because not only the number of ultra-poor populations has increased within two years of the pandemic, but it has also slowed down national growth and targets that aim to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce gender inequality in terms of receiving work opportunities, safe work environments, and use of economic resources. To handle the COVID-19 pandemic, improving social protection programs and financing social security systems have become more urgent. In the 8th FYP, this would be a key focus, both as a tool to address the impacts of COVID-19 on poverty and as an instrument to enhance the growth elasticity of poverty reduction [53 ]. Budget allocation for social protection will be raised from 1.2% in FY2019 to 2% in FY 2025. The plan also schemed the digital/mobile financial services system as an effective measure for the financial inclusion of the poor and marginalized groups [53 ]. Furthermore, the Government of Bangladesh issued a series of stimulus programs totalling about US$13.25 billion under 21 packages, roughly 4.03% of the overall GDP [26 ]. The package includes special funds for wage assistance to export-oriented industry workers, investment credits for the impacted industries and service sectors, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and cottage industries, cash transfers, shelter for the homeless, credit facilities, and social protection safety net, etc. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) also extended its support for Bangladeshi nationals regarding social protection, including cash transfers, universal health coverage, and other essential services [5 ]. In such a scenario, we have prepared the DPSIR framework depicting the long-term gendered effect on poverty among women, as shown in Fig. 4  . It is evident that COVID-19, along with reduced foreign orders, supply chain service disruption in the global market as well as weak governance and political commitment, led to production loss in the RMG sector were the main driving forces. Reduced orders and supply chain disruption in the RMG sector put tremendous pressure on the market's economic growth. Subsequently, an unstable market increases unemployment and scarce job opportunities, and the rising inequality ultimately pressures the SDG targets of decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). From the financial pressures, the economic state leads to income and savings loss, increased debt, less consumption of goods and services, sub-standard living, hunger and malnutrition, and lack of available social services in the communities. The economic pressure on society leads to the social impact and the targets of achieving SDG 1 on poverty reduction. Subsequently, economic poverty raises domestic violence [18,54 ]. Furthermore, loss of residence and urban-to-rural migration also occur due to poverty. Lack of social protection and economic security are also the reasons for increased poverty among women. Therefore, macro and micro-level policies must allocate a budget for financial support and socioeconomic response plans to promote alternative and diversified employment opportunities. Adoption of new policy approaches is also needed to ensure the participation of all sections of society in agricultural production and distribution and introduce a care-based economy for the social protection of women and other underprivileged groups.  4.2 Effect on women's health and wellbeing (SDG 3) Even though Bangladesh had incessantly been progressing in maternal and reproductive health situations in the pre-COVID-19 period [18 ], it has again popped up with negative impacts of COVID-19. Evidence has shown that while men have a higher mortality rate due to COVID-19, women have a higher risk of various adverse health risks. According to the UN (2020), the main reason behind this health disparity is excessive pressure on the health sector to deal with COVID-19, therefore resource reallocation, particularly sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services remained less focused. Even before COVID-19, there was a shortage of healthcare professionals in Bangladesh which has undoubtedly increased while the entire health system concentrates on combating the new disease. Furthermore, most front-line health workers are women, particularly those who provide reproductive health services, i.e., doctors, nurses, midwives, and health care workers. Unfortunately, these reproductive health service providers were at direct risk of COVID-19 infection, and many died while providing medical services. Many health professionals, i.e., doctors, nurses, and midwives, have refrained from providing services (both in public and private facilities) to avoid this risk. Although the state had tried to force them in many ways to continue their work [28 ], no doubt, the women and adolescent girls could not access emergency maternal and reproductive health services when needed. Moreover, accessing information about contraception use, its sources, and collecting contraception have been complex for them due to movement restrictions, lockdowns, and social distance policies [58 ,77 ], thus, put them into more negative sexual and reproductive health consequences. Furthermore, unemployment, staying home, and fear of contracting the virus have further led women to have decreased uptake of contraception, simultaneously showing higher rates of unintended pregnancy, multiple pregnancies with short intervals, and unsafe abortions [2 ]. Evidence showed a 10% decreased rate of short-term and long-acting reversible contraception use in LMICs [77 ]. According to UNICEF [48 ], an additional 3.5 million unintended pregnancies will likely occur in South Asia during 2020. While the women and adolescent girls of Bangladesh require knowledge on preventing unintended pregnancies and complications during pregnancy and safe childbirth, the entire health system has concentrated on handling COVID-19. Evidence showed that pregnant and recently delivered mothers who required essential maternal health services, such as antenatal care, institutional birth, and post-partum care, had skipped entirely. Where to give birth – many pregnant women were worried about it and had faced difficulties in making decisions [56 ]. The main barriers were difficulty accessing the services as the services were limited or stopped, the anxiety of being exposed to the virus, fear of stigma, movement restrictions etc. [56–58 ]. These factors encouraged women to give birth at home with a lack of safe delivery services, which increased the risks of maternal complications and risk their lives and their newborns' lives [55 ,56 ]. According to a published report, maternal mortality in Bangladesh has risen about 25%–30% during the pandemic period [58 ]. Socio-cultural contexts may further complicate SRH access and use. In Bangladesh, people who are not married are not expected to get pregnant and use contraception outside of marriage. Sex, age, and marital status are the factors that decide the eligibility criteria for receiving SRH services. However, real life does not follow strict societal rules, and unmarried adolescent girls who are sexually active require SRH services too. It would not be an absurd thought that during COVID-19, unmarried pregnant adolescents would be seeking but not getting necessary SRH treatments due to perceived stigma and associated shame or societal norms related to marriage, sexuality, and childbirth [59 ]. Besides SRH services, one other maternal health matrix, nutrition, was also ravaged by COVID-19 in Bangladesh. Both maternal and child malnutrition rates were expected to rise due to COVID-19 and its associated influences on poverty, coverage of essential interventions, and everyday intake of nourishing and healthy foods [60 ]. Although maternal and reproductive health services are critical for any country like Bangladesh, and there have not been many initiatives in this regard, from the health authorities, except for some awareness programs in the media. Moreover, tele-consulting and online health consultations were found to be very limited in urban areas [61 ] while these services were limited in rural areas due to poor network availability and technological disadvantages. Most importantly, the commitment and leadership needed to maintain urgent health care to provide SRH services were minimally observed. During COVID-19, ignoring maternal and reproductive health issues by the health authorities were one of the main driving forces of the COVID-19 situation that worsened women's health status and well-being. Social stigma, movement restrictions during the lockdown, and weak health leadership by the authorities were the other driving forces to have a multitude of effects on SDG 3 (Fig. 5  ). COVID-19 put pressure on the reallocation of limited maternal and SRH services, medical consultation on pregnancy and childbirth emergencies, adolescent mothers' SRH services, unintended or multiple pregnancies, and anxiety over institutional childbirth among the population. Consequently, anemia, calcium, and other mineral deficiency are observed among women and adolescents, home and unsafe birth increased, and antenatal and postnatal care services have decreased. Moreover, mismanagement in providing/receiving health care for women and girls has been observed. Therefore, the overall impact falls on the targets of SDG 3 while increasing unsafe abortion, miscarriage, maternal morbidity and mortality, pre-mature births as well as infant mortality. Thus, restoration of SRH services is essential for the country, and increasing health financing, including incentives for health professionals, especially those who work at the field level, also increases online and teleconsultation for SRH. In addition, knowledge and awareness programs on radio, television, and online platform could be a response to the crisis. Increasing trained SRH health professionals, especially in rural and remote areas, would be necessary to respond to COVID-19 in reducing SRH-related risk and management (Fig. 5 ).  4.3 Effects on female education (SDG 4) According to UNESCO (2021), partial or complete school closures for one year during the COVID-19 pandemic had put 90% of students out of school, and over 100 million additional children would fall below the minimum proficiency level in reading. Most of these girls were from the least developed countries [62 ,79 ]. Other significant impacts of education loss were mental health problems, school dropouts with higher risks of child labour, and child marriage [48 ]. Due to the prolonged lockdown and 18 months, (from March 17, 2020, to mid-September 2021) of school closure, approximately 39.93 million learners had been affected in Bangladesh, of which 20.21 million were female [48 ]. Bangladesh is one of the top five countries globally regarding child marriage. It is estimated that child marriage rate in Bangladesh increased by 13% in 2020, which was the highest rate of child marriage in Bangladesh in the last 25 years. Subsequently, the closure of educational institutions for about 18 months due to the pandemic increased the child marriage by 220% from July to September 2020 [63 ]. Furthermore, the education system of Bangladesh is significantly attached to earning and livelihood, which compels many children of poorer families to drop out of educational institutions to fight against poverty. It is evident that during COVID-19, most of the students' education was compromised, and many female students ended their education as young brides. Save the Children [64 ] reported that in the South Asian region, 191,200 girls were at risk of child marriage within the first year of the pandemic, while 138,000 girls were at risk of adolescent pregnancy. The risk of child marriages has intensified due to parents' financial difficulties and income loss [65 ]. These marriages are often forced and result in abusive sexual relationships and unintended pregnancies, preventing young girls from school [62 ]. On the other hand, evidence shows that a substantial percentage of youngsters have faced mental health problems as the prolonged shutdown affected their regular routine due to school closures, physical activities, and behaviours [66 ]. Moreover, parents' lack of awareness of childcare, financial condition, and job security has profound effects on the psychological well-being of children. Although online classes replaced face-to-face physical classrooms, the new learning system did not succeed as many students could not afford appropriate devices or internet facilities, especially those were in rural areas. Necessary public tests like board examinations, university entrance examinations, and university semester examinations were postponed or altered. Although the SDGs have the motto of "leave no one behind", it has created a severe disparity in the education system. Discrepancies in the education system have been raised, particularly for poor children in poverty, and it is likely to remain in the country for longer. These will primarily affect female students, which may drop their studies too. Evidence from epidemics such as African Ebola shows that adolescent girls from the poorest families were at particular risk of dropping out and not returning to school after the crisis [67 ]. Fear of COVID-19 infection among students and teachers has been the driving force for long-term school closure at all educational levels. As a result, the quality of primary, secondary, and tertiary education has been compromised. Many students in the rural area at the primary level have not received basic reading, writing, and mathematics skill. STEM education has been severely affected as well. Although the government ordered online education as a response, it was primarily inaccessible in rural areas due to a lack of smartphones, electricity, and internet unavailability. Fig. 6   describes the DPSIR framework of long-term gendered effects on education. It is evident that COVID-19 created inequality in learning in rural and urban areas and session jams in secondary, higher secondary, and tertiary education. All these states would impact the targets of SDG-4. It has also increased child marriage and adolescent pregnancy, physical and mental health, adolescent maternal death, depression, and unemployment among students. Some essential responses from the concerned authorities were needed to be undertaken, such as providing smartphones and devices with stable internet access, online physical and mental health counselling, strengthening school-feeding programs, and scholarships for the students who were not able to continue studying due to poverty, especially for female students. Ensuring vaccination for school-going children was another necessary step which has been undertaken by the GoB lately.  4.4 COVID-19 effect on gender relations (SDG 5) COVID-19-related income loss, stay-home policy, social distance, fear of infection, and the psychosocial environment have tremendous impacts on gender relations [68 ]. Thus, the risk of domestic violence has become prevalent worldwide including Bangladesh. Numerous domestic violence incidents in Bangladesh have been recorded, while there might have been unreported cases. The type of abuse ranges from verbal to physical to financial to psychological to sexual [69 ]. Odhikar, a local NGO, found that rape against women and girl children below 18 years increased between January and September 2020 compared to 2019. In 2019, a total of 834 women and children were raped; in 2020, 919 women and children were raped, of which 325 were women and 569 were children. The rape of children was roughly twice as common as the rape of adult women. Furthermore, 21 women and 18 children had died as a result of rape incidents [70 ]. COVID-19 altered women's lives by changing how they studied or worked in pre-COVID situations [16 ,21 ]. Many women lost their jobs overnight, and many started working from home. All these 'new realities', including schools and day-care closures increased women's caregiving responsibilities, arguably, with an extra burden on women than men [16 ,19 ]. Working from home had been more difficult for women when they had to share work hours for home management and professional activities. A rapid assessment study by BRAC [71 ] found that 91% COVID-19 of women had increased unpaid care work during the COVID-19 period, while 89% stated experiencing no relaxation time. Intended unpaid care and domestic chores have heightened for women without or with little help from men [46 ]. Unlike working women, since the schools were closed, adolescent girls had to perform additional house chores due to gender roles. Individuals have accommodated their gender roles in response to life events and work modes [72 ]. Consequently, the overall gender gap has increased [25 ]. To understand the gender relations during COVID-19, the role of gender needs to be understood within the patriarchal social contexts of Bangladesh. Conventionally, women carry the responsibility of all the care and household work. For example, women's work is considered informal caregiving jobs such as raising children, taking care of elderly people, maintaining communication with family and relatives, social work, and informal household activities such as housework, cooking, cleaning, etc. Consequently, women spend three times more time in household activities and care than men while reducing self-care and heightened mental health complications [73 ]. Gender role plays a vital role in inciting gender-based violence. As the COVID-19 pandemic prolonged, gender relations have been altered and/or violated in many ways, especially in fulfilling women's fundamental human rights. Adolescent girls and women were most vulnerable regarding equality in all spheres of life during COVID-19 [54 ]. At the same time, it disconnected the victims from their support networks [70 ]. Even though in a male-dominated society like Bangladesh, violence against women is widespread in every sphere of society, especially for dowry, discussing this issue outside the family is not encouraged. Many women were forced to live with their abusers at home during the lockdown period while the support services for the victim women were interrupted or unavailable [56 ,74 ]. Therefore, during the shadow pandemic, gender-based violence increased exponentially. To tackle domestic violence, addressing specific risk factors as well as identification and management of domestic violence are essential. Necessary victim assistances, activisms, and physical and mental treatment supports are also required. To reduce domestic violence, multi-sectoral responses such as medical, social, and psychiatric responses are needed to be strengthened [75 ]. It is evident from the above discussion that the existing societal and gender inequality in the society, patriarchal culture, and structural misogynistic power practice during COVID-19 were the main driving force that increased domestic violence (DV) among women and children of Bangladesh (Fig. 7  ). Bangladesh has an excellent support system in government and non-government sectors, including shelter homes, victim support centres, One Stop Crisis Centre, and a National Helpline Centre for violence against women and children services that run the multi-sectoral program on violence against women [76 ]. However, all these support services were dispersed, deficient in harmonization, and inadequate during the COVID-19 period. Shelter homes were closed or provided limited victim supports, which further pressured on gender relations. In addition, people are generally unaware of these services because of a lack of publicity. Lack of training is another problem: the 'departments' employees are also not adequately aware of their responsibilities, as provided by the domestic violence legislation. Therefore, women do not get benefits from the support services or the legislation. Family and childcare time also increased while s/he remained the victim of domestic violence. These have a tremendous impact on gender relations and affect the targets of SDG-5. On the one hand, society is welcoming physically, mentally, and sexually abused women and children, on the other hand, experiencing increased rate of divorce and family breakdown along with rape, murder, and deaths out of domestic violence. The matter of hope is that support services for physically and mentally abused women and children are gradually expanding along with other COVID-19 responses. Hence, dedicated phone lines with proper counsellors, safe shelters, and legal services are needed to ensure the victims' social protection. Most importantly, mass people’s awareness of domestic violence and support services is a must. All kinds of media engagement, including social, electronic, and print, could be more useful in this regard. Fig. 7  describes the DPSIR framework depicting increased domestic violence, gender discrimination, and gender relations amidst COVID-19.   5 Discussion In the previous section, we have presented the gendered impact of COVID-19 concerning five specific SDGs' (SDG 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8) of Bangladesh through DPSIR analysis. The findings indicated how the deepening effects of COVID-19 intersect with different socioeconomic and cultural aspects, including poverty, education, health, inequality and work opportunities, economic growth as well as government policies. Based on the analysis, we want to raise the question that how far Bangladesh's SDG targets can be achieved having such impacts of COVID-19? However, this question applies not only to Bangladesh but also to the whole world. The answer, certainly, depends on country-specific responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Nevertheless, many think tanks suggested that SDGs require a rethink [1–4 ]. New ideologies and approaches need to be adopted because the world would face excessive structural challenges caused by the long-term effects of the pandemic when some significant achievements through SDGs would completely be wiped out. A massive reformation in every sector would have been needed with more financing. Many thinkers and researchers have already mentioned that with the right policies and timely action, Bangladesh could accelerate its recovery from the economic downturn and continue progressing towards upper-middle-income status [35 ]. However, we want to ask whether the SDGs, related interventions, more financing, and policies would be adequate for COVID-19 responses. Or will there be a situation that can be called 'post-COVID-19'? Because there is a strong possibility that we would be living our lives along with COVID-19 as other viruses forever. Despite the fact that should we run after SDGs after all the impacts on humanity through COVID-19? Should we not learn and think about what this pandemic has brought to us? COVID-19 has been defined as a "neoliberal disease", and an outcome of the current world economic system [2 ]. This is because the economy provides maximum efforts only for profit-making. COVID-19 has exposed us to the fact that we have created a world where the 'market' is more important than protecting our health – our existence. Thus, many argue for something unconventional, new philosophies to save human society, alternatives to the neoliberal economy, and behavioural changes in all sections of society [1–4 ]. These arguments suggest a substitute for SDGs, combining nature and economic system, for the old paradigm, the neoliberal economy, because the disease has emerged in this system and turned this world into a place of death and mourning. In this article, we would like to ally our thoughts with the ecofeminist perspectives as an alternative to the neoliberal capitalist system. These perspectives essentially focus on the harmful effects of the capitalist system, which exploits nature indiscriminately, destroys biodiversity, and harms ecosystems through various developmental projects, especially in the Third World. These projects are undoubtedly grounded on unlimited growth and profits by exploiting nature [1–4 ,7 ]. Our DPSIR framework analysis has shown that gendered vulnerabilities and patriarchal violence against women have exacerbated in COVID-19 situation in the areas of poverty (SDG 1), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), health and well-being (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), and gender relations (SDG 5). These have close connections with masculine power exercises and policies as well. For example, movement restrictions and lockdowns were pursued forcefully, violating human rights without arranging income sources, and overlooking marginalized people's basic needs, including women [78 ]. Unlike Bangladesh, many countries in the global south have been experiencing a similar situation. However, some countries, including Latin America and Africa, mostly led by female leaders have adopted gender sensitive or feminist initiatives to combat the COVID-19 crisis [1 ,25 ]. Most of these initiatives focus on awareness building to prevent the coronavirus, providing support to the survivors of gender-based violence, providing flexible work arrangements, educating women and girls about hygiene, providing masks and necessary supplies for proper protection measures, mobilizing women to prioritize health, life, and care [1 ,4 ,25 ]. These approaches are primarily based on human rights, intersectionality, and reducing economic inequality. Furthermore, these initiatives also observed right-based, flexible, and people-inclusive COVID-19 recovery strategies where marginalized communities and social groups from different sections of society were at the forefront [1 ,25 ]. Protecting humans by preventing a virus, reducing natural destruction, inclusivity and working together for a green growth and resilience economy are at the heart of these approaches. Therefore, if our goal is to build a resilient society, our targets and indicators should be deconstructive, not based on the ideas that reinforce capitalist society, which also means revisiting SDGs. Our COVID-19 experiences have revealed that health care and well-being are devoted to neoliberal thoughts to ensure the commodification of health and medicine through the privatization of health care [2 ]. Therefore, we wanted to emphasize the 'care' concept to build a resilient society which can be a potential alternative to a market and profit-based economic society. Then we have proposed ecofeminist philosophies where nature and human beings are intertwined, where the soil, forest, animals, air, and water would not be exhausted by human greed. We want to express that humans would not fulfil their needs by destroying nature but secure their future by caring for it. For these paradigm shifts, commitment and leadership towards green growth are inevitable, and not dependent on masculine strengths. Because at this time of COVID-19, we understood that how crucial mutual care and love are. The relationship between nature and health must be combined to deconstruct this economic system. That trend has already begun. Although complex and challenging, the world community must take the opportunity to re-examine the future of the global economy.  6 Conclusion In this article, we have reviewed and identified the gendered effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the SDGs in Bangladesh. To conduct this review we have purposively selected five SDGs, especially those that have a direct impact on gender, such as SDG 1: no poverty, SDG 3: good health and well-being, SDG 4: inclusive and quality education and learning opportunities, SDG 5: gender equality, and SDG 8: decent work and economic growth. In this review, firstly, we have identified COVID-19 as a neoliberal disease as well as a by-product of the neoliberal economy. We have argued that a profit-based market economy or industrial society has been developed by destroying the relationships between nature and human beings, and nature has been used for maximising economic profit. Thus, diseases like coronavirus has been evolved as a consequence of bio-diversity and eco-system destruction of nature. Secondly, we have shown how COVID-19 has affected LMICs development and wellbeing by using a gender lens. Using DPSIR analysis, we have found that COVID-19 has multiple long-term negative effects while poverty has increased due to the economic downturn, losing jobs, savings and debts, especially among the marginalized population; necessary SRH services for women and girls were out of reach, mostly neglected due to handling COVID-19 treatment which has negatively impacted on women’s health and nutrition; school closure and education loss resulted in mental health issues, school dropouts, and increased rate of child labour and child marriage among female students; gender gap increased with pre-existing patriarchal values, women’s gender roles while coping with stay-home policies, lockdown etc. Having devastating effects in all walks of life we have raised our question shall we run after the SDGs that stand on the profit-based capitalist social system? Finally, we have argued that any financial aid or structural adjustment would not be adequate for any LMIC like Bangladesh. To overcome the devastating effects of coronavirus, rather, we need a paradigm shift to build a nature-based, equality-based, and care-based interdependent global society. Future research themes can be developed on gender and policy research to provide a wider foundation for bridging existing theories to new insights. Because it is crucial time to think about restoring a reciprocal relationship between nature and human beings for a resilient future for all.
