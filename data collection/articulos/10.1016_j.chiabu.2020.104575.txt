                  Background
                  The monitoring of trends is important. The United Nations (UN) have defined indicators to monitor the proportion of young men and women who have experienced sexual abuse before the age of 18 (Indicator 16.2.3) as part of their global agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
               
                  Objective
                  To examine recent trends in the disclosure of sexual abuse based on the indicator 16.2.3 of the SDG.
               
                  Participants and setting
                  A total of 7530 participants across Germany (51.1% female) were included. The participants were between 14 and 94 years old.
               
                  Methods
                  Three representative surveys were conducted using identical methods in 2010 (N = 2504), 2016 (N = 2510) and 2018 (N = 2516). A history of child sexual abuse (CSA) was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The prevalence rates of CSA among the age cohort of 18 to 29-year olds (indicator 16.2.3) were compared across the three waves.
               
                  Results
                  There was no significant increase of rates in males in this specific age cohort (2010: 7.6%; 2016: 8.5%; 2018: 6.1%), but there was a significant increase among the females of this age cohort (2010: 12.8%; 2016: 13.5%; 2018: 26.1%). The increase was entirely between the survey in 2016 and 2018.
               
                  Conclusions
                  This is the first study to report on indicator 16.2.3 of UN’s SDGs in Germany. The identified increase in rates of sexual abuse among 18–29 year old females might have been triggered by the attention the topic received in the time between 2016 and 2018, especially via social media and the #MeToo debate.

University of Ulm Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychotherapy Steinhövelstraße 5 Ulm 89075 Germany       Background The monitoring of trends is important. The United Nations (UN) have defined indicators to monitor the proportion of young men and women who have experienced sexual abuse before the age of 18 (Indicator 16.2.3) as part of their global agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).  Objective To examine recent trends in the disclosure of sexual abuse based on the indicator 16.2.3 of the SDG.  Participants and setting A total of 7530 participants across Germany (51.1% female) were included. The participants were between 14 and 94 years old.  Methods Three representative surveys were conducted using identical methods in 2010 (N = 2504), 2016 (N = 2510) and 2018 (N = 2516). A history of child sexual abuse (CSA) was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The prevalence rates of CSA among the age cohort of 18 to 29-year olds (indicator 16.2.3) were compared across the three waves.  Results There was no significant increase of rates in males in this specific age cohort (2010: 7.6%; 2016: 8.5%; 2018: 6.1%), but there was a significant increase among the females of this age cohort (2010: 12.8%; 2016: 13.5%; 2018: 26.1%). The increase was entirely between the survey in 2016 and 2018.  Conclusions This is the first study to report on indicator 16.2.3 of UN’s SDGs in Germany. The identified increase in rates of sexual abuse among 18–29 year old females might have been triggered by the attention the topic received in the time between 2016 and 2018, especially via social media and the #MeToo debate.   Keywords SDG 16.2  Prevalence  Sexual abuse  Representative sample  Monitoring  Trends    1 Background Child maltreatment is considered a major public health problem. The negative consequences for those affected are diverse and regularly reach into adulthood (Buckingham & Daniolos, 2013 ; De Bellis, 2001 ; Hughes et al., 2017 ; Silverman, Reinherz, & Giaconia, 1996 ). Beyond the individual consequences, child maltreatment causes a high economic burden for societies each year (Fang, Brown, Florence, & Mercy, 2012 ; Habetha, Bleich, Weidenhammer, & Fegert, 2012 ). Meta-analyses underline the magnitude of the problem as they report a prevalence of 12.7% for child sexual abuse (CSA) world-wide (Stoltenborgh, Van Ijzendoorn, Euser, & Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2011 ) and a prevalence rate of 13.4% for CSA of females and 5.7% of males for the European region (Sethi et al., 2013 ). In recognition of this problem, the United Nations (UN) have made the fight against child maltreatment part of their global agenda until 2030. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have been developed to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all and include seventeen goals (United Nations, 2015 ). The fight against child maltreatment is part of goal 16 “Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions” and specifically addressed in target 16.2 “End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children”. To monitor progress for each target, specific indicators have been defined. The indicators for target 16.2 are the following:• 16.2.1: Proportion of children aged 1–17 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month.  • 16.2.2: Number of victims of human trafficking per 100.000 population, by sex, age and form of exploitation.  • 16.2.3: Proportion of young women and men aged 18–29 years who experienced sexual violence by age 18.    By analysing these indicators, it becomes apparent that the applicability of the indicators differs. For example, indictor 16.2.1 may be difficult to assess since monitoring systems, if they exist (Jud et al., 2013 ), are usually not prepared to provide information in such short-term intervals. However, indicator 16.2.3 seems to be highly suitable for a monitoring system, even though no information on the operationalization of CSA is provided. The chosen age range seems to be appropriate for the monitoring of more recent trends in CSA. To the best of our knowledge, up to date, no data on indicator 16.2.3 has been published (Jud et al., 2013 ). However, meta-analyses on the prevalence of CSA exist and document persistently high rates (Barth, Bermetz, Heim, Trelle, & Tonia, 2013 ; Pereda, Guilera, Forns, & Gómez-Benito, 2009 ; Sethi et al., 2013 ; Stoltenborgh et al., 2011 ). While there is a considerable data basis in the US that indicates a decline of rates of sexual abuse since the 1990s based on different sources of information (Finkelhor & Jones, 2012 ), much less is known about trends in rates of CSA outside the US (Jud, Fegert, & Finkelhor, 2016 ; Witt et al., 2018 ). However, such monitoring data is critical to evaluate interventions and prevention programs (World Health Organization, 2007 ). Both, data on the prevalence in the general population and child abuse reporting data are needed (Jud et al., 2016 ). Underreporting and the lack of comparable data represent important barriers to fully understand the magnitude of the problem (United Nations Economic & Social Council, 2017 ). This is particularly important as reports indicate that about 90% of cases go undetected (Gilbert et al., 2009 ; Krug, Dahlberg, Mercy, Zwi, & Lozano, 2002 ; Sethi et al., 2013 ). The collection of robust and regular indicators of violence against children, such as SDG indicator 16.2.3, would be an important starting point for national action plans. However, trends may not only be affected by prevention and intervention programs but may also be associated with the implementation of surveillance. It can be regularly observed that with the implementation of a new monitoring the numbers of detected cases increase (Eckenrode & Dineeen, 2009 ): These increases are at least partly attributable to the heightened attention on the phenomenon. Additionally, social developments, media events and broad public discussions may affect how non-consensual sexual behaviors are perceived, e.g. research in the UK shows that attitudes towards sexual consent differ significantly between age groups (End Violence Against Women Coalition, 2018 ). Consequently, attitudes towards disclosure of experiences may change as well and may lead to short-term variations in prevalence rates that may not be attributed to an actual increase or decrease of perpetrations of CSA. Therefore, sensitizing for a problem may first lead to an increase instead of a decrease of numbers. Currently, the debate under #MeToo hit worldwide media attention starting in mid-October 2017. Especially prominent cases, such as the Harvey Weinstein case or the case of US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh are examples that had the potential for a large public sensitization for the issue. The aim of the present study is the examination of trends in prevalence rates of sexual abuse with a special focus on indicator 16.2.3 of the SDGs, i.e. the proportion of young men and women (between 18 and 29 years of age) who have experienced CSA before the age of 18 in three representative samples. With such data conclusion about recent trends can be drawn and potential causes for changes are discussed.  2 Methods 2.1 Procedure The present study is based on three population-based surveys using identical procedures including a total of 7530 participants. The surveys were conducted in 2010, 2016 and 2018. In all studies, the services of a social research institute (USUMA, Berlin, Germany) were used to select a representative sample of respondents from all over Germany, employing a random route approach. Starting with a randomly selected, specific address from, every third household was approached by a researcher, and residents of the identified households were invited to take part in the study. For multi-person households, one person was randomly selected using the Kish selection grid technique. Inclusion criteria were a minimum age of 14 years and sufficient German language skills. Prospective participants were informed that the study was about psychological health and well-being. Informed consent was obtained from participants. In cases of legally minors, participants gave informed assent with informed consent being provided by their parents. The data collection consisted of two parts. In a first part sociodemographic information was obtained by a face-to-face interview. After that the researcher gave the participant the questionnaires, along with an envelope to seal the questionnaires in once they were done, and then left the room but remained nearby in case any assistance was required. The completed questionnaires were linked to the respondent’s demographic data, but did not contain name, address, or any other identifying information. Due to the design of the survey and due to data protection requirements a direct identification of participants with ongoing sexual abuse is not possible. However, participants were provided with contact details in case they needed support. For the purpose of the present study sociodemographic information and the subscale “sexual abuse” of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (Bernstein et al., 2003 ) of the three data sets were combined. The main difference between the three surveys was that in 2010 and 2016 the whole CTQ was used, while in 2018 only the subscale “sexual abuse” was administered. The overall non-response rates for each survey were 56% for 2010, 51.2% for 2016 and 46.3% for 2018. Main reasons for non-participation were failure to contact anyone in the residence (2010: after three attempts: 11.1%, 2016: after four attempts: 14.9%, 2018: 13.4%), refusal by the individual who answered the door to have anyone in the household participate in the study (2010: 12.8%; 2016: 15.3%, 2018: 22.4%), failure to contact the randomly selected household member (2010: after three attempts: 2.8%, 2016: after four attempts: 2.3%, 2018: after four attempts: 3.1%) and refusal by the selected member to participate (2010: 15.6%; 2016: 14.7%, 2018: 12.7%). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and fulfilled the ethical guidelines of the International Code of Marketing and Social Research Practice of the International Chamber of Commerce and of the European Society of Opinion and Marketing Research. Prior to being carried out, it was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Leipzig.  2.2 Measures The sociodemographic questionnaire solicited information on age, gender, citizenship, geographical area (rural vs. urban), educational and occupational status, and partnership status. Sexual abuse was assessed using the 5-item subscale of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Bernstein et al., 2003 ; Wingenfeld et al., 2010 ). The questions and the answering format are listed in Box 1  . The CTQ is a widely used instrument that solicits information about five types of maltreatment: emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and physical and emotional neglect. The psychometric properties of the German version of the CTQ have been demonstrated by Klinitzke et al. (Klinitzke, Romppel, Hauser, Brahler, & Glaesmer, 2012 ) and Wingenfeld et al. (Wingenfeld et al., 2010 ), with internal consistency ranging between α  = 0.62 and α  = 0.96 for the subscales. The internal consistency for the subscale sexual abuse was α  = 0.89 (Klinitzke et al., 2012 ). For the subscale, severity scores are categorized as “none to minimal”, “minimal to moderate”, “moderate to severe”, or “severe to extreme”, using the severity coding of Häuser et al. (Häuser, Schmutzer, Br„hler, & Glaesmer, 2011 ).  2.3 Statistical analyses Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21. To account for possible distortion in representativeness due to the sampling procedure, weights were calculated and used in the analyses. Severity and prevalence of sexual abuse were summarized using descriptive statistics; prevalence rates between the samples were compared using χ2  tests to examine trends. For the analyses of trends the major focus lay on the age group of the 18–29 year olds (SDG 16.2.3). However, each sample was categorized into seven age cohorts: 14–17 years, 18–29 years, 30–39 years, 40–49 years, 50–59 years, 60–69 years and 70 years and older. To account for multiple testing a Bonferroni-correction of the α -level was conducted.   3 Results Results of the first survey are available from Häuser et al. (Häuser et al., 2011 ) and of the second survey from Witt et al. (Witt, Brown, Plener, Brähler, & Fegert, 2017 ). This is the first study to analyze trends on basis of all three data sets. A total of 7530 participants took part. 3.1 Participants In the 2010 survey, a total of 4902 households were approached of which 2504 (51%) agreed to take part. In 2016, 4902 households were approached of which 2510 (51%) took part and in 2018, 5316 households were approached of which 2516 (47.3%) took part. Detailed demographic characteristics for all three samples are presented in Table 1  . In the 2010 sample, 51.3% of respondents were female, mean age was 47.6 years (SD = 19), and 4.5% did not hold German citizenship; in the 2016 sample, 51% were female, mean age was 48.6 years (SD = 19.2), and 3.5% did not hold German citizenship. In the most recent sample 51.0% of respondents were female, mean age was 48.8 years (SD = 18.9), and 4.3% did not hold German citizenship. All samples were representative of the German population with regard to gender and age, but participants being born outside of German were noticeably underrepresented.  3.2 Rates of sexual abuse in the total sample Generally, an increase in rates between 2010 (12.1% at least minimal to moderate sexual abuse) and 2018 (13.7% at least minimal to moderate sexual abuse) for the overall sample can be observed. While an increase in rates for females can be observed (2010: 14.9% at least minimal to moderate sexual abuse, 2016: 18.0% at least minimal to moderate sexual abuse, 2018: 18.2% at least minimal to moderate sexual abuse), the rates for male participants remained stable (2010: 9.2% at least minimal to moderate sexual abuse, 2016: 9.4% at least minimal to moderate sexual abuse, 2018: 8.9% at least minimal to moderate sexual abuse). The detailed rates are presented in Table 2  . χ2 -tests only revealed differences in the rates of sexual abuse in female participants between 2010 and 2016 with negligible effect sizes (see Table 3  ). If controlled for multiple testing, e.g. with a Bonferroni-correction of the α -level, those differences did not reach a significance level.  3.3 Rates of sexual abuse by age group and gender Analyses of rates of sexual abuse by age group and gender, reveals varying rates in different age groups and for males and females (see Table 4  ). The major focus of the present study is on the age group of 18–29 year olds that represent the age group addressed in indicator 16.2.3 of the SDGs. The focus on this specific age group allows conclusions on more recent trends. The data show an increase in rates for this age group between 2016 and 2018. This increase is largely due to a sharp increase in rates among 18–29 year old females between 2016 and 2018, while the rate for males in the same period remains stable (Table 4  and Fig. 1  ). χ2 - tests indicate statistical significant differences in rates with small effect sizes (see Tables Table 5A  5A, Table 5B  5B).   4 Discussion The aim of the present study was to report data on SDG indicator 16.2.3. The study covers a time span of 8 years including three assessments (2010, 2016, 2018) of large representative samples. It has to be mentioned, that the first two assessments were 6 years apart while there was a two years period between the second and the third assessment. In the overall sample, an increase of rates of sexual abuse can be observed between 2010 and 2016. This increase has been reported before and potential factors adding to this increase, such as an increase in awareness about the problem after the so called “abuse scandal” in Germany in 2010, are discussed in detail by Witt et al. (2018) . The data indicate a sharp increase in the proportion of young women between 18 and 29 years who disclose sexual abuse, while the rate among males in the same age group largely remains stable. Also, the overall prevalence rates of the total sample largely remained stable indicating that the effect is specific for females between 18 and 29 years. Generally, it has to be stated that this is a particularly large effect for a short time period. Therefore, one has to be cautious interpreting these results as there is the possibility that this effect is a random effect given the sample size. However, one possible explanation might be the broad public discussions between the last two survey years about sexual abuse triggered by prominent cases, such as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Kevin Spacey, Brett Kavanagh and the accompanying #MeToo debate. The #Metoo debate gained popularity during 2017 with the Tweet of Alyssa Milano stating “If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote “Me too.” as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.” (Alyssa Milano, October 15, 2017, https://twitter.com/alyssa_milano/status/919659438700670976?lang=de ). The aim was to increase awareness about sexual violence, sexual abuse and sexual harassment (http://time.com/5189945/whats-the-difference-between-the-metoo-and-times-up-movements/ ). The hashtag was very prominent in social media. Within only one month, Twitter confirmed that the hashtag or its translation had been used over 1.7 million times (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/metoo-reaches-85-countries-with-1-7-million-tweets/ ). Media attention in Germany peaked in November 2017 when popular talk shows, major newspapers and tabloids were discussing the fallout of the tweets. In January 2018, media attention peaked again, when a first celebrity, movie director Dieter Wedel, was accused of (sexual) violence by actresses. The broad public discussion of the issue may have caused both reappraisal of experiences and increased willingness to disclose experiences. Such processes of reappraisal and increased willingness of disclosure may have led to the increase in rates observed in the present study. While the #MeToo debate was present in all the media channels, it was particularly popular in social media. As young persons are generally more active on social media, this discussion may have affected young females more than older generations, explaining why the increase was present for only this younger age cohort. The rather subjective wording of the sexual abuse items in the CTQ may have also contributed to the change in appraisal phenomenon. Another problem is the very short time frame in which the increase appeared to have occurred -- a two year period. Given that the age cohort being assessed (18–29) included an eleven year span, to produce the large observed increase the rate of abuse, the two new single year groups in the cohort (18–19 in 2018) would have to have had hugely greater exposure to abuse than the two departing age groups (28–29 in 2016). Again, a more plausible explanation is that appraisal and disclosures were altered in the cohort during that 2 year period. It seems unlikely, that the observed increase is due to an actual increase in acts of perpetration. 4.1 Limitations It has to be stated that even though the methodology of the three surveys was completely identical, the items on CSA were in each study year part of a larger survey with other, varying measures. Positioning of the CSA items differed between the different waves. Additionally, in the first two surveys the whole CTQ was administered, while in the survey of 2018 only the subscale of sexual abuse of the CTQ was used. Therefore, it could be argued that the present results might be due to methodological effects such as positioning effects. However, these effects should have affected all age groups and females and males in the same way. But the effect seems to be very specific for the 18 – 29- year olds. Methodological effects as the cause for the present therefore seem unlikely. Additionally, it has to be considered that the subscale sexual abuse of the CTQ includes items that are rated subjectively with labels like “somewhat true”. They probably reflect how confident respondents are about whether something that happened was sexual abuse. However, thus responses might actually be more prone vary with reappraisal of situations due to public awareness on the issue. Additionally, the relatively small sample sizes in the subgroups should be considered as a limiting factor while interpreting the results. In their meta-analysis of research on child maltreatment prevalence, Stoltenborgh et al. (2011)  have pointed to significantly lower rates for larger samples. It is thus likely that the small sample sizes may at least in part account for the variations in prevalence rates, observed in the present study and future studies should focus on larger samples in this age cohort. Finally, a possible selection bias should be considered. As households that were experiencing abuse or maltreatment might have been less likely to participate in door to door surveys, this might have led to underreporting.  4.2 Conclusions Indicator16.2.3 of the SDGs, i.e. the proportion of young men and women who report CSA by the age of 18 is an important indicator for the assessment of recent trends in sexual abuse. The results indicate an increase in disclosure of rates of sexual among females between 18 and 29 years. This increase may have been triggered by the broad public discussion around this issue and be due to an increased willingness of disclosure and reappraisal of own experiences than due to an actual increase in victimizations. However, the time span covered in the present study is relatively short, especially for the identification of trends. More and longer term studies are needed to determine trends. Additionally, studies from other countries are needed to determine, whether similar effects can be observed in other countries as well.
