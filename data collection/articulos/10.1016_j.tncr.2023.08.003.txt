                  FDI inflows and poverty reduction nexus has been an ongoing global debate in the recent times. Against this backdrop, this study examined the relationship between FDI inflows and poverty reduction in this economic bloc between 1990 and 2019. Data was collected from UNCTAD and WDI respectively, and a Panel Error Correction Model and the Pairwise Dumitrescu Hurlin Panel Causality tests were respectively employed. The following findings originated from the study; firstly, the relationship between FDI inflows and human development was negative and significant in the short run. In the long run, the reverse was the case. Therefore, the study concluded that FDI inflows have a trickle-down effect on poverty reduction in BRICS countries only in the long run. Therefore, it was recommended that for the policymakers in BRICS countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1), policy that will propel massive inflows of FDI into BRICS economies should be explored.

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  ∗ Corresponding author.      FDI inflows and poverty reduction nexus has been an ongoing global debate in the recent times. Against this backdrop, this study examined the relationship between FDI inflows and poverty reduction in this economic bloc between 1990 and 2019. Data was collected from UNCTAD and WDI respectively, and a Panel Error Correction Model and the Pairwise Dumitrescu Hurlin Panel Causality tests were respectively employed. The following findings originated from the study; firstly, the relationship between FDI inflows and human development was negative and significant in the short run. In the long run, the reverse was the case. Therefore, the study concluded that FDI inflows have a trickle-down effect on poverty reduction in BRICS countries only in the long run. Therefore, it was recommended that for the policymakers in BRICS countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1), policy that will propel massive inflows of FDI into BRICS economies should be explored.   Keywords FDI inflows  Poverty reduction  BRICS  SDGs   JEL classification F21  F23  F36    1 Introduction After the post assessment of the Millennium Development Goals in 2015, the global concern to eradicate poverty is becoming intensified in both developing and emerging economies. This is because about 150 million persons in the globe have been projected to move into extreme poverty and experience food insecurity amidst the COVID-19 pandemic (Mamun and Ullah, 2020 ). Meanwhile, reference to the global development agenda, the necessity for a global action in the world's 193 countries to end poverty globally motivated the United Nations to declare the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 (United Nations, 2015 ). Since then, reduction of poverty in emerging economies has become a critical issue of discussion among the scholars and policymakers. An attempt to combat poverty globally has redirected the strategies of different countries across the globe to mobilize all the resources at their disposal towards employment generation, economic growth and poverty reduction in the long run (see Fig. 1  ). However, the situation report of emerging nations such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, BRICS shows that the extreme and moderate working poverty has been drastically declined more than other middle-income economies in the past two decades to the extent that over 18 ​% of the population was lifted out of the extreme poverty in this bloc comparing to those of approximately 3.7 ​% in other middle-income countries (ILO, 2019 ). In the recent times, FDI has been identified as one of the strategic engines of the economic prosperity. Further empirical evidence has reinforced that FDI has the potential to propel advancement of growth in various countries (Bhuimali et al., 2019 ; Mahembe and Odhiambo, 2019 ; Simplice and Odhiambo, 2020 ; Azam and Feng, 2021 ). Beyond economic growth, emerging economies are more positioned to benefit more from FDI (Asian Development Bank, 2021 ; Knoerich, 2017 ). This is because inflows of FDI into the economy could be embraced as a medium of creating jobs and reduction of poverty via appropriate institutions (Anand, 2019 ). Consequently, it has been observed that FDI and poverty reduction nexus is an ongoing global debate (Hanim, 2021 ; Okoh et al. 2022 ; Aderemi et al., 2020 ; Fayyaz et al., 2019 ; Shamim et al., 2014 ). However, a cursory look into the literature shows that this narrative has not been well articulated in BRICS countries. Recent studies focusing on BRICS such as Tsaurai (2020)  provided a mixed finding regarding FDI and poverty reduction. Meanwhile, other study like that of Sukhadolets et al. (2020)  utilized poverty head count to measure poverty reduction. It is instructive to stress that the calculation of poverty head count was based on a poverty line of 1.90 US dollars per day.  One of the major problems in adopting poverty head count as proxy for poverty reduction in empirical studies is paucity of data or incomplete data set in one hand and the differences in its measurement in various countries. Against this backdrop, the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) institutionalized Human Development Index (HDI) as a better measurement of poverty reduction due to its multidimensional approach in assessing human welfare, and the data is available for all countries (UNDP, 2019 ). Meanwhile, few recent studies have employed HDI as a proxy for poverty reduction globally. See (Aderemi et al., 2021 ; Fayyaz et al., 2019 ; Gohou and Soumare. 2012 ). However, to the best of our knowledge, no study employing HDI as a measure of poverty reduction has been carried out in BRICS countries in the recent times. In the light of the above, this current study has been designed to fill the existing gap in among the body of knowledge. Hence, this study examines the relationship between FDI and poverty reduction within the BRICS economic bloc. The paper is patterned as follows. In the introductory section, the study`s problem was conceived and justified systematically. Empirical studies were reviewed in section two of the paper. While, section three contains methodology, discussion of results, summary of findings and policy implication of this study.  2 Literature review 2.1 Theoretical review 2.1.1 The Benign Model of FDI Moran (1998)  proposed the Benign Model of FDI with the notion that FDI could be conceptualized as a financial apparatus which possesses the capacity to break through the vicious circle of poverty (VCP) in which Ragnar proposed in 1953 . Based on the Moran`s school of thought, inadequacy of finance is the major sponsor of poverty in an economy. When capital increases, so does output and savings in one hand. And on the other hand, when investment increases an economy will experience a rise in the prosperity of economy, job availability and improvement of wellbeing as time goes on. Consequently, the Benign Model has a connection with the work of Prebisch (1951) , who argues that FDI possesses an inbuilt capital that stimulates technological flows, market mechanism and management skills that could catalyze development of industrial base in developing countries. For an instance, the US economy rapidly grew in the 20th century, largely owing to the migration of human and physical capital resources from Europe, especially the Great Britain (Sackey et al., 2012 ). Against this backdrop, the Vicious Circle of Poverty was developed as follows. The above figure points to a circular network of circumstances otherwise tagged vicious circle of poverty. Developing countries remain in poverty on perpetual basis because income is extremely low in these countries (Ogbuabor et al., 2013; Rohima et al., 2013 ). Based on this model, these countries are constantly trapped in a demand and supply disequilibrium which are very difficult to break through, and this could be tagged as ‘a poverty cage’. From the perspective of the demand angle, low incomes imply that households do not possess adequate post tax income for consumption, and their potential to engaging in saving is limited as well. When demand is low on the supply–point of view, this leads to high inventory because the buying power of consumer is low. Hence, all the economic agents including producers, consumers and manufacturers possess inadequate profits and a low tendency for saving. This metamorphoses into deficient financing system and low productivity in the economy. Therefore, firms go back to the poverty cage. However, an attempt to break this poverty cage, Moran (1998)  put forward the Benign Model to prove the appropriateness of FDI as a tool that can be adopted to disintegrate the Vicious Circle of Poverty. He submitted that FDI eliminates poverty if the savings gap is bridged, and this lead to an increase in the capital volume of a developing market, and increasing the supply side production. But, on the demand angle, as production sparks off, demand for human resources rises alongside the wage rate. This in turn brings about a rise in household incomes firms’ profits and poverty eradication in the economy in the long run.   2.2 Empirical review Globally, studies regarding FDI and poverty nexus are attracting the attention of scholars and policymakers. This has given birth to a plethora of studies in which effort has been made here to present the various submissions of past authors concerning the focus of this paper. In a work investigated by Aderemi et al. (2020) , a panel technique of estimation was used to explore the assessment of FDI inflows on alleviation of poverty among sixteen economies in ECOWAS sub-region between 1990 and 2017. The finding from the study argued that a significant level of poverty alleviation was stimulated by FDI inflows in the sub region. Hanim (2021)  applied the Triangular Hypothesis to study the influence of FDI in reducing poverty in Indonesian economy between 2012 and 2016. The author argued that FDI exerted a significant direct influence in the growth of the Indonesian economy, in which the growth of the economy resulted into a significant impacts on the alleviation of poverty. However, economic growth and income inequality interacted in such a way that caused a significant stronger impact on amelioration of poverty in the nation. In the view of Tsaurai (2018) while exploring the economies of southern and western Africa, a panel technique of estimation was utilized to examine the possibility of the complementarity between natural resources availability and FDI in combating poverty from 2002 to 2012. It was inferred from the work that FDI was stimulated by the availability of abundant natural resources in resources rich nations. Also, the interactive behavior of FDI and natural resources motivated reduction of poverty in African economies under the investigation. Kechagia and Metaxas (2022)  assessed the contribution of governance in the attraction of FDI in BRIC and other emerging markets such as South Africa, Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey within the period of 2002 and 2019. The authors argued that the lack of violence, political stability, rule of law, and regulatory quality were the motivating factors of FDI inflows BRIC countries. Meanwhile, regulatory quality, absence of uprising, effective governance, stability of political climate and regulation of corruption motivated FDI inflows in the rest of other sampled emerging markets. Okoh et al. (2022)  assessed the dynamic interaction of FDI, trade openness and poverty reduction within BRICS countries using Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) and Variance Decomposition. It was evident from the study the internet users, FDI, trade openness and HDI showed immediate response to each other’s innovations. However, Sukhadolets et al. (2020)  applied ARDL technique to the estimation of linkage between FDI, capital invested in construction and reduction of poverty in BRICS and EU markets with the aid of ARDL technique. The paper submitted that FDI ameliorated the unpleasant influence of financial crises. And in the long run, economies of countries under consideration were supported by the investment in construction, which its spillovers led to the reduction poverty level through the expansion of the assets of the population. In another related study, Bayar (2017)  employed data in a panel form to evaluate the nexus between financial development and poverty dwindling between 1993 and 2012 using emerging market economies as a case study. The study posited that both development of stock market and banking sector motivated a major direct interference on the dwindling of poverty in the emerging markets. Aderemi et al. (2019)  pooled data from BRICS countries, Hong Kong and Singapore with the application of the causality to analyze the relationship between FDI and economic growth commencing from 1990 to 2017. The findings from the study established the existence of a long run convergence among FDI, GDP per capita, growth rate and economic growth in the study. FDI also Granger caused economic growth in those countries. Meanwhile, Aderemi et al. (2018)  sampled BRICS countries, Hong Kong and Singapore while investigating a comparative influence of FDI on economic growth in those economies within 1990 and 2017. The submission of the authors was that the major propeller of FDI inflows in China was huge market size, growth rate and living standard of people in the country. However, it was only market size that motivated the inflows of FDI in Hong Kong, India, Brazil, South Africa and Singapore respectively. Standard of living was considered as inconsequential factor stimulating the inflows of FDI in South Africa and Russia. In other emerging 12 Eastern and Latin American countries, Huang et al. (2010)  utilized an unbalanced panel in assessing the connection of FDI inflows and reduction of poverty from 1970 to 2005. It was established in the paper that FDI was not be able reduce poverty in the studied economies. Aderemi et al. (2019)  explored data from BRICS countries to assess a long run and a panel cause-effect that exists between the growth of the BRICS economies and FDI in the study. A long run convergence exists among the relevant variables of interest. While employing a dynamic panel regression and Granger-causality, Soumare (2015)  estimated the influence of FDI on welfare in North Africa from 1990 to 2011. The author argued that the linkage between the inflows of FDI and welfare improvement was positive and robust in the North Africa region. Ucal (2014)  applied an unbalanced panel technique in the investigation of poverty and FDI nexus in twenty six developing countries within 1990 and 2009. It was discovered from the study that FDI contributed to poverty reduction. In summary, the review studies show that huge gap exists in the literature because in spite of the fact FDI and poverty nexus has been widely examined globally yet few studies exist within BRICS bloc. As a departure from the existing literature regarding FDI and poverty reduction, this current study focuses on BRICS countries.   3 Methodology This article made use of an ex-post facto research design in the evaluation of FDI and poverty reduction nexus in BRICS nations owing to the principal focus of this paper is the exploration and description of a feasible network that exists between poverty reduction and FDI in BRICS economies. Consequently, data from 1990 to 2019 was extracted from the UNCTAD and WDI databases. 3.1 Theoretical framework This study considers an augmented version of Solow model as appropriate theoretical framework for this study. In an a scenario to investigate the constituency or otherwise of living standards of various economies with the propositions of the Solow model, Mankiw et al. (1992)  explored a sample of 98 economies. Mankiw et al. (1992)  submitted that predictions from the Solow model were in tandem with the evidence from their empirical work. However, the Solow model was deficient in accurately predicting the magnitudes of the effects of saving and population growth, with the respect to the actual data of the economies under consideration. In correcting this shortcoming, Mankiw et al. (1992)  put forward the augmented Solow model by incorporating human capital as a form of capital in the existing Solow model. The incorporation of human capital in the augmented model rectifies the influence of savings and rise in population which was overestimated in the original Solow model. Meanwhile, it is important to stress that two justifications motivated the reason why human capital was included into the Solow model. Firstly, the consideration of human capital caused physical capital accumulation and population growth to greatly impact income. In the same vein, omitted variable biasness existed in the Solow growth model as a result of the absence of human capital variable, as savings and population growth accumulation is correlated with of human capital. Furthermore, FDI represented one of the strategic components which cannot be undermined in international capital flow. Meanwhile, the argument of the U-shaped hypothesis is that economic growth worsens poverty and inequality submitted that in the early stages. However, the moment the economy achieves the middle-income status as experienced by BRICS countries, economic growth commences to generate reduction in poverty in inequality respectively. It could be stressed that the direction of this article informs the specification of equation to capture the key objective of this work as thus.  3.2 Specification of model Estimation of FDI net inflow and poverty dwindling within a panel analysis of BRICS markets requires a quantitative methodology. Therefore, the theoretical framework of this study could be extended to address the objective of this study by adapting model from the works of Sukhadolets et al. (2020)  and Aderemi et al. (2020) . In the adapted model, the variables that have no direct and indirect connection to the goal of the study were eliminated from the model. The inclusion of gross fixed capital formation (GCF), trade openness (TOP) and individual using internet as percentage of population (INTE) as control variables are emanating from the assertion of the extant literature that these variables facilitate the inflows of FDI in emerging countries, and these variables have either direct or indirect impact on welfare of people simultaneously. If HDI is substituted in equation (9) , then we have;(1) HDI = f  ( FDI )       Model 1 could be illustrated in an explicit form as below.(2) HDI t  = f   ( FDI t  , TRO t ,    INTE t  , GCF t  )       The model could be log linearized as follows(3) HDI t  = β  + α 1  FDI t  + α 2  TRO t  + α 03  INTE t  + α 4  GCF t  + u t       Stating equation (2)  in a panel form therefore, we have(4) HDI it  = +  α 0  + β 1  FDI it  + β 2  TRO it  + β 3  INTE it  + β 4  GCF it  + u it       It is important to stress that in achieving the first objective of this, transformation of equation (4)  into a dynamic panel model generates equation (5)  as follows;(5) H D I  i t   = ∑ i = 1   p  Ω 1   H D I  i t  − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  Ω 2    F D I  i t   + ∑ i = 1   p  Ω 3   T R O  i t   + ∑ i = 1   p  Ω 4    I N T E  i t   + ∑ i = 1   p  Ω 5   G C F  i t   + θ E C M  i t   + Ω 6  Δ H D I  i t  − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  Ω 7   Δ F D I  i t   + ∑ i = 1   p  Ω 8   Δ T R O  i t   + ∑ i = 1   p  Ω 9   Δ I N T E  i t   + ∑ i = 1   p  Ω 10   Δ G C F  i t   + μ      In estimating the direction of causality between FDI and poverty reduction, the following set of models would be estimated.(6) H D I  t  = α 0  + ∑ i = 0   p  α 1   H D I  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 2   F D I  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 3   T R O  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 4  I N T E  t − 1      + ∑ i = 0   p  α 5  G C F  t − 1      + u 1 t       (7) F D I  t  = α 0  + ∑ i = 0   p  α 1   F D I  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 2   T R O  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 3   I N T E  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 4  H D I  t − 1      + ∑ i = 0   p  α 5  G C F  t − 1      + u 2 t       (8) T R O  t  = α 0  + ∑ i = 0   p  α 1   T R O  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 2   F D I  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 3   H D I  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 4  I N T E  t − 1      + ∑ i = 0   p  α 5  G C F  t − 1      + u 3 t       (9) I N T E  t  = α 0  + ∑ i = 0   p  α 1   I N T E  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 2   F D I  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 3   H D I  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 4  T R O  t − 1      + ∑ i = 0   p  α 5  G C F  t − 1      + u 4 t       (10) G C F  t  = α 0  + ∑ i = 0   p  α 1   G C F  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 2   F D I  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 3   H D I  t − 1    + ∑ i = 0   p  α 4  T R O  t − 1      + ∑ i = 0   p  α 5  I N T E  t − 1      + u 5 t        It is important to state that the aprori expectation is that Ω 1  to Ω 10   ​> ​0 . Meanwhile , Ω 1  to Ω 5  represent the  short run parameters and Ω 6  to Ω 10   represent the long run parameters simultaneously. Similarly, θ    is the speed of adjustment between short run and long run parameters. p represents lag length. i  denotes the number of countries under consideration which are Brazil, Russia, India, China, India and South Africa. t  is time period from 1990 to 2019.  3.3 Table 1: Measurement of variables and justification for inclusion In Table 1  , the meaning of abbreviations of various variables, the operational definitions and sources of the data were explicitly stated.   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Pre-estimation results This section of the study accounts for the various pre-estimating tests like correlation analyses, descriptive statistics, stationary test, cointegration test and VAR Lag Order Selection Criteria. These tests are very crucial in econometric analysis because they give an insight to the researcher regarding the appropriate technique of analysis. The presentation of the descriptive statistics of the relevant variables of interest are done in Table 2   These account for the behavior of the series in the model. Firstly, in BRICS countries, the mean value of HDI was 0.69 ​% with the least and highest values of 0.613 ​% and 0.77 concurrently. The variable has a standard deviation that is less than its mean value. This means that HDI is moderately dispersed from its mean. Similarly, FDI as a percentage of GDP has a mean value of 2.67 ​% alongside a minimum value of 0.18 ​% and 5 ​% simultaneously. The variable dispersed in a moderate form from its mean because the value of mean of the variable is greater than its standard deviation. Trade openness has a least value of 15.1 ​% and highest value of 29.6 ​% at the same time. Its mean value is 23.2 ​% which is bigger than its corresponding standard deviation. That is an indication that the variable dispersed in a moderate sense from the mean. In the same vein, INTE possesses minimum and maximum values as 0.0 ​% and 70.4 ​% concurrently. The mean value of the variable is narrowly greater than its standard deviation. This indicates that the variable is moderately dispersed from the mean. Also, GCF has a mean value of 18.4 ​% alongside 22.8 ​% and 14.5 ​% as its maximum and minimum values respectively. The mean value of the variable is higher than its standard deviation. Therefore, the variable is moderately dispersed from the mean value. In conclusion, it could be inferred from the above that the adopted variables in this study possess assumption of the normal distribution which is one of the requirements in which data for econometric analysis should fulfil. 4.1.1 Correlation analyses Table 3   provides the estimated results of various pairs of correlation that exist among the explanatory variables in this study. In verifying whether the set of explanatory variables have the possibility of multicollinearity or otherwise, various pairs of correlation analyses were estimated in which their outcomes were presented in Table 3 . Consequently, it was discovered that the various pairs of the independent variables possess the degrees of correlation which are not big enough to result in multicollinearity in the verification of the subsequent models. The above statement was reinforced by the argument of Goldberger (1991)  who stipulated that a simple correlation between a pair of independent variables could lead to multicollinearity in the equation if it is bigger than 0.9.   4.2 Panel unit root tests The test for stationarity of the dataset was carried out in this section with the application of the appropriate unit root techniques such as Levin, Lin & Chu t∗ Test and Im, Pesaran and Shin W-stat Test in its estimated outputs were outline in Table 4  . Time series data usually linked with the problem of unit root which is a major factor behind the existence of misleading regression in an empirical study. It is beneficial to stress that spurious finding in a study could engineer biased policy implication. In the process of overcoming this problem leads to the investigation of stationarity properties of the data within various standard unit root test techniques such as Levin, Lin & Chu t∗ Test and Im, Pesaran and Shin W-stat Test. The estimated results in Table 4  established that the variables are mixture of I(0), I(1) and I(2). This implies that all the variables except HDI are not stationary in their natural forms. It has been argued that a unit root in data could lead to a short run disequilibrium among the variables of interest. However, the disequilibrium could become equilibrated in the long run. Against this backdrop, effort was made in this study to verify the long run equilibrium relationship among the relevant variables of interest. Meanwhile, the estimated results from Johansen Fisher Panel Cointegration Test indicate that a long run convergence existed among the variables. The estimation of dynamic model such as error correction model requires the selection of the optimal lag. This is because dynamic model shows the influence of variable in the previous year on the current year. Consequently, the results from Table 6    indicate that all the information criteria point to that lag one as the optimal lag length for the model. In Table 7  , the short run and the long run regression estimates between FDI inflows and poverty reduction in BRICS countries were presented. All the short run estimated coefficients did not possess the expected indicator, however, the long run estimates show otherwise. Consequently, the estimate of the ECM is both appropriate signed and significant. The implication of this is that 30.5 ​% is the adjustment speed connecting the long run and short run. In other words, 30.5 ​% of error as a result of shocks is corrected per annum in the model. Meanwhile, the connection between FDI inflows and human development is negative and significant in the short run. A unit change in FDI inflows reduces human development by 0.000904 ​% in BRICS countries. This implies that FDI inflows do not have a trickle-down effect on poverty dwindling in the short while in the economic bloc. Whereas, in the long run, FDI inflows and human development possess a pleasant and major relationship in BRICS countries. A unit change FDI leads to rise in the level of human development in the countries in the long run. This implies that FDI inflows have a trickle-down influence on poverty dwindling in BRICS countries as time progresses. In addition, capital formation and HDI possess a minor negative relationship in the short run. But the connection becomes positive and significant in the long run. Similarly, internet usage and human development possess a negative and significant relationship in the short span. While, in the long span, direct and inconsequential relationship emerged among the variables. Trade openness and human development have a significant and inverse relationship in both the short run and the long run respectively in BRICS countries. By and large, it could be concluded in this study that FDI have a trickle-down effect on poverty reduction in BRICS countries only in the long run. This submission is in tandem with the arguments of the following studies; Sukhadolets et al. (2020)  focusing on BRICS and EU countries, Aderemi et al. (2020)  focusing on ECOWAS sub-region, Hanim (2021)  focusing on Indonesian economy, Ucal (2014)  focusing on twenty six developing countries and Soumare (2015)  focusing on North Africa. However, the proposition of studies such as Ali and Nishat (2010) , Huang et al. (2010)  contradicts the finding in this study. The long run convergence among the relevant variables of interest had been earlier established in Table 5 . In spite of this, we made further efforts to interrogate the existence or otherwise of direction of causality FDI, poverty reduction and other control variables within the technique of Pairwise Dumitrescu Hurlin Panel Causality Tests. Consequently, Table 8   shows the estimated results which could be enunciated as thus; there is a bidirectional causal network between FDI and gross fixed capital formation. Moreover, FDI inflows and HDI have a bidirectional feedback relationship. This implies that FDI and poverty reduction motivate each other in BRICS countries. Furthermore, other pair of variables possess a unidirectional causality in the economic bloc.   5 Summary, conclusion and policy implications The study has employed variety of econometric tools to examine the relationship between FDI inflows and poverty reduction in BRICS countries nations during the period of 1990 to 2019. After establishing the stationary properties of various data utilized in the study, the paper identified a long run relationship between FDI inflows and poverty reduction in the economic bloc. Meanwhile, the findings that emerged from the panel error correction model and the causality tests are enunciated as follows; firstly, the estimate of the error correction model shows that 30.5 ​% of error as a result of shocks in the short run is corrected per annum in the long term in the model. Furthermore, the relationship between FDI inflows and human development is not majorly pleasant in the short period. Whereas, as time progresses, the reverse is the case. Capital formation and human development have an inconsequential unpleasant relationship in the short run. But the relationship becomes positive and significant in the long run. Similarly, internet usage and human development possess a negative and significant relationship in the short span. While, the long span relationship turns positive and insignificant. Openness to trade and HDI have a significant and inverse relationship in both the short run and the long run respectively in BRICS countries. Also, a bidirectional causal relationship exists between FDI and gross fixed capital formation in one hand FDI inflows and HDI have a bidirectional feedback relationship on the other hand. Therefore, the study concludes that study that FDI inflows have a trickle-down effect on poverty reduction in BRICS countries only in the long time. Besides, FDI and reduction of poverty have a feedback linkage in BRICS countries. Against this backdrop, the following recommendations are made for the policymakers in BRICS countries; in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1) - poverty reduction, policy that will propel massive inflows of FDI into BRICS economies should be explored. And as such, the BRICS economic bloc will be able to achieve the 1st Sustainable Development Goal (poverty reduction) in the long run comes 2030.  6 Limitations and future directions The major limitation of present study could be attributed to its scope (BRICS countries). However, future researches could expand this scope to include other emerging markets such as the ‘Asian Tigers`. In the same vein, poverty head count, if the data is available, could also be utilized to measure poverty reduction by future researchers.
