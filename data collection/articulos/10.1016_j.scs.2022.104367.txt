                  The synergies and trade-offs between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) influence their ultimate achievement. Poverty eradication is the first goal of the SDGs, and the impact of poverty is clearly all-encompassing. However, it remains unclear how poverty affects the changing synergies and trade-offs between the SDGs. Here, taking a typical underdeveloped region in China as the research area, this study evaluated the synergies and trade-offs between SDGs by calculating the SDG Index and the Multidimensional Poverty Index. We further explored the heterogeneous effects of poverty on different impoverished groups and the mechanism of the synergies and trade-offs between SDGs. The results showed that SDGs were mainly synergistic, and a few indicators (SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 13 Climate Action, SDG 15 Life on Land) had trade-offs with other indicators. Poverty hindered the achievement of most SDGs, and inhibition was heterogeneous among different SDGs and impoverished groups. Poverty inhibited synergies and magnified trade-offs among SDGs; it also turned synergies into trade-offs for certain SDGs (SDGs 1 and 7, SDGs 2 and 8, and SDGs 3 and 8). This study can provide a reference for other less developed regions to make reasonable and integrated arrangements for their sustainable development.

The synergies and trade-offs between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) influence their ultimate achievement. Poverty eradication is the first goal of the SDGs, and the impact of poverty is clearly all-encompassing. However, it remains unclear how poverty affects the changing synergies and trade-offs between the SDGs. Here, taking a typical underdeveloped region in China as the research area, this study evaluated the synergies and trade-offs between SDGs by calculating the SDG Index and the Multidimensional Poverty Index. We further explored the heterogeneous effects of poverty on different impoverished groups and the mechanism of the synergies and trade-offs between SDGs. The results showed that SDGs were mainly synergistic, and a few indicators (SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 13 Climate Action, SDG 15 Life on Land) had trade-offs with other indicators. Poverty hindered the achievement of most SDGs, and inhibition was heterogeneous among different SDGs and impoverished groups. Poverty inhibited synergies and magnified trade-offs among SDGs; it also turned synergies into trade-offs for certain SDGs (SDGs 1 and 7, SDGs 2 and 8, and SDGs 3 and 8). This study can provide a reference for other less developed regions to make reasonable and integrated arrangements for their sustainable development.

Based on the prior Millennium Development Goals adopted in 2000, the SDGs have broader aims (NilssonÂ etÂ al., 2016 ), including addressing inequality, economic growth, decent work, sustainable cities and communities, industrialization, oceans, ecosystems, energy, climate change, sustainable consumption and production, and peace and justice (Schmidt-TraubÂ etÂ al., 2017 ; Zhenmin & Espinosa,Â 2019 ; BlasiÂ etÂ al., 2022 ). The series of measurable targets are supposed to guide and track national and global efforts to achieve sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda regards the 17 SDGs as interconnected (vanÂ Soest etÂ al., 2019 ), which means that progress on one goal is linked to the status of other goals (MiolaÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; AndersonÂ etÂ al., 2021 ). Moreover, progress shows that there are complex mutual-feedback relationships between different SDGs, including synergies (advantages) and trade-offs (disadvantages) (LeÂ Blanc,Â 2015 ; ZhangÂ etÂ al., 2022 ). KrollÂ etÂ al.Â (2019)  forecasted trends in and interactions between SDGs until 2030, analyzing the trade-offs and synergies. Taking an SDG database of 166 countries, WuÂ etÂ al.Â (2022)  used a correlation network approach to analyze SDG interactions and found stronger positive and negative associations among SDGs at low and high sustainability levels; at medium levels, however, they clustered into more isolated groups of positive associations. In addition to focusing on the overall SDGs network and the trade-offs and synergies between them, researchers also aim to explore how certain goals relate to other goals or influencing factors. DeÂ Neve & SachsÂ (2020) , meanwhile, explored the link between SDG achievement and subjective well-being and found strong positive correlations between SDGs in most cases; however, SDG 12 (responsible production and consumption) and SDG 13 (climate action) were negatively associated with well-being, suggesting there might be some short-term trade-offs in sustainability. WangÂ etÂ al.Â (2022) , meanwhile, found 319 interactions between clean-water SDGs (SDGs 6 and 14) and other SDGs, among which 286 were positive (synergistic) interactions and 33 were negative (trade-off) interactions. While studies have confirmed there are interactions between SDGs, such interactions require further study (NilssonÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). Understanding the interactions between SDGs is key to SDG achievement (BennichÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). Meeting the SDG targets can facilitate global sustainability and ensure well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental protection (CloughÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; SebestyÃ©nÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; XuÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). Therefore, all SDGs need to be fully developed (SachsÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; BlicharskaÂ etÂ al., 2021 ), but achieving them largely depends on whether synergies can be fully exploited and trade-offs avoided (Moyer & Bohl,Â 2019 ). In this regard, how to exploit synergies and avoid trade-offs poses a challenge for planners and policymakers (CaiadoÂ etÂ al., 2018 ; PederciniÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). Eradicating poverty is a common goal of human society (Vosti & Reardon,Â 1997 ). The UN's 2030 Agenda and the corresponding SDGs take poverty reduction as a top priority, aiming to ultimately eradicate poverty throughout the world (UnitedÂ Nations,Â 2015 ). Currently, more than 800 million people live on less than $1.25 a day, one-fifth of people in developing regions live at a similar level, millions barely earn more than that level, and many are at risk of falling back into poverty (World Bank, 2020). In addition, the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to reverse decades of progress in eradicating poverty (Naidoo & Fisher,Â 2020 ; GeÂ etÂ al., 2022 ), which further hinder SDGs achievement (QadeerÂ etÂ al., 2022 ). Ending poverty has strong synergies with most other SDGs and is highly correlated with progress on other goals (Jolliffe & Prydz,Â 2016 ). Investigating how poverty affects synergies and trade-offs among SDGs and exploring ways to achieve synergies have become important research issues (GriggsÂ etÂ al., 2017 ; MesserliÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; DiÂ Lucia etÂ al., 2022 ). TableÂ A1  shows examples of the SDGs associated with poverty. Using official SDG indicator data, PradhanÂ etÂ al.Â (2017)  analyzed SDG interactions in 227 countries; they found that poverty eradication (SDG 1) was synergistic with most other goals, notably SDG 3 (health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 10 (reducing equality). Lusseau & ManciniÂ (2019)  estimated SDG interaction networks using a global time series of SDG indicators with countries at different income levels; they found that focusing on poverty alleviation and reducing inequality would have positive effects on all other SDGs. Campagnolo & DavideÂ (2019)  provided an ex-ante assessment that the impacts of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted under the Paris Agreement, would had on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of poverty eradication (SDG1) and reduced income inequality (SDG10). SoergelÂ etÂ al.Â (2021)  used the IAM (Integrative Ambulatory Measurement) framework to assess potential trade-offs between SDG 1 and SGD 13 (climate action) and explored ways to mitigate such trade-offs. Using global expenditure data, BrucknerÂ etÂ al.Â (2022)  calculated the per capita carbon footprint of different countries and found that achieving SDG 1 would lift more than one billion people out of poverty while increasing emissions by only 1.6â2.1%, thus enabling continued progress toward climate goals. Poverty poses threat to achieving almost all of the SDGs (FusoÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). In this regard, policies aimed at reducing poverty may have positive and lasting effects on the achievement of all SDGs (GriggsÂ etÂ al., 2014 ). Studies on the trade-offs and synergies between SDGs have been abundant, and some researchers have noted the important role of poverty in the process of realizing SDGs. However, the following research gaps still need to be filled: First of all, researchers have realized that poverty hinders the development of SDGs, but further quantitative studies are needed to investigate the different impacts and dynamic changes between different SDGs. Secondly, most studies focus on the positive and negative associations between poverty and specific SDG goals, and few researchers take into account the impoverished groups and their different characteristics. In fact, they are the key players in sustainable policy practices. Finally, existing researches have not clarified the specific and dynamic effects of poverty on the trade-offs and synergies among SDGs, which are worthy of further study. Bearing in mind the central role that poverty plays in the context of the SDGs, the purpose of this paper is to provide a contribution to a better understanding of poverty's effect on synergies and trade-offs between SDGs, and the heterogeneous effects of poverty on the SDGs' development for different poor groups, which may hinder efforts to fight it. In other words, this paper aims to discusses the role of poverty and how it poses a central barrier in the implementation of the SDGs in underdeveloped area. The city of Lincang in Yunnan Province is a typical underdeveloped area in China. Taking Lincang as the research area, we combined qualitative and quantitative methods to measure the SDG Index and Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and evaluate synergies and trade-offs between SDGs. We further analyzed the heterogeneous effects of poverty on different groups and the mechanism of synergies and trade-offs between SDG indicators. Based on this, we propose measures to alleviate poverty's effect on SDG achievement. This study makes the following contributions: (1) We evaluated 91 indicators (58 SDG indicators and 33 localized indicators) of 16 goals (SDG 14 was excluded, because the study area is not a coastal area.) in the study area and constructed an SDG indicator framework for the municipal level in China. This supplements and expands upon existing SDG research. (2) We quantitatively evaluated the heterogeneous effects of poverty on the SDG Index for different poverty groups in the study area, which has significance in SDG-related theory and policy, as well as the formulation of specific measures targeting different poverty groups. (3) This study is also the first to investigate poverty's effect on synergies and trade-offs between SDGs, confirming that poverty inhibits synergies and magnifies trade-offs. Specifically, poverty was found to have a subversive effect on the relationships between individual SDGs, turning synergies into trade-offs.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area Lincang is located on the southwest border of Yunnan Province, China, with a land area of 2.362 million hectares, of which 97.5% is mountainous. Lincang has a subtropical low-latitude plateau mountain monsoon climate with sufficient sunshine, abundant rainfall, warm winters, and cool summers. Lincang comprises one district, four counties, and three ethnic counties (Fig.Â 1  ), with a total population of 2.258 million people, among which 23 ethnic minority groups (e.g., Yi, Wa, Lahu, Dai, and Brown) account for 38.22%. In May 2019, Lincang was approved to build a national sustainable development innovation demonstration zone with the theme of innovation-driven development in borderland, multi-ethnic underdeveloped areas. It aims to explore applicable technical routes and system solutions, form an effective model that is operable, replicable, and scalable, and provide practical experience for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. With its rich ethnic cultural resources and excellent environment, Lincang offers unique resource advantages for the construction of a sustainable development demonstration zone.  2.2 Data sources and research methods By referring to the SDGs Criteria Database and combining the actual situation of the study area with data availability, we evaluated 91 indicators (58 SDG indicators and 33 localized indicators) of 16 goals (TableÂ A2 ) in this study. Our data on 91 indicators and poverty related data came from the Lincang Statistical Yearbook, Lincang Water Resources Bulletin, Lincang National Economic and Social Development Statistical Bulletin, Lincang SDG Progress Evaluation Report Supported by Big Earth Data, official statistics on poverty-stricken households in Lincang, and information provided by government departments. Through data collection, classification, calculation, and evaluation, along with supplementary research, we measured index values of 16 SDGs and the MPI of farmers in Lincang from 2013 to 2020. 2.2.1 Data standardization and index weighting In a multi-index evaluation system, the evaluation indexes usually have different dimensions and orders of magnitude owing to their different natures. When the level of each index differs greatly, if the original index value is used for analysis, the effect of the index with a higher value will be highlighted, and the effect of the index with a lower value will be weakened. Therefore, to ensure reliability, the original data need to be standardized. Min-max normalization was therefore applied to all data in this study to make the SDG index calculated later comparable between different targets. MinâMax normalization refers to the linear transformation of the original data to map values between [0, 1] (JainÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). Maximum value of 1 does not mean SDG target has been achieved. And the closer the standardized value is to 1, the higher the level of development measured by the indicator. The standardization formula is:x  *  = x i  â m i n  x i   m a x  x i  â m i n  x i        x i    is the original data of the evaluation indicator, x  *    is the normalized data of each indicator, and m a x  x i     and m i n  x i     are the maximum and minimum values of the indicator. In the process of calculating MPI and the SDG Index, entropy weighting was used to weigh each indicator (Wu & Zhang,Â 2011 ). The entropy weight method is an objective weighting method that determines weights according to the variability of indicators. It is based on the principle that the smaller the variability of the indicator, the less information it reflects, and the lower its corresponding weight should be (KumarÂ etÂ al., 2021 ). The entropy weight method calculation steps are as follows: Suppose there are n objects to be evaluated and a matrix X n m     composed of m evaluation indicators. Standardize the data x i j     in X n m    , the standardized matrix is denoted as Z n m    , and each element in Z n m     is:z i j   = x i j   / â i = 1  n  x i j  2         Calculate the proportion of the ith sample under the jth indicator and regard it as the probability p used in the relative entropy calculation. Each element in the probability matrix P n m     is as follows:p i j   = z i j   / â i = 1  n  z i j        Calculate the information entropy and information utility value of each indicator, and normalize it to obtain the entropy weight of each indicator. For the jth index, the calculation formula of its information entropy e j    is:e j  = â 1 l n n   â i = 1  n  p i j   l n ( p i j   )        The larger e j    is, the larger the information entropy of the jth indicator is, and the smaller the corresponding amount of information is. Define the information utility value d j   , and the calculation formula is as follows:d j  = 1 â e j       Normalize the information utility value to get the entropy weight of each indicator:Î± j  = d j  / â j = 1  m  d j        2.2.2 Multidimensional poverty index (MPI) calculation We used the AlkireâFoster model (Alkire & Santos,Â 2014 ) to measure the multidimensional poverty of farmers in Lincang. First, we constructed a multidimensional poverty evaluation index system as shown in TableÂ A3 . In the process of index selection, combining existing research (ZengÂ etÂ al., 2021 ; Vollmer & Alkire,Â 2022 ) with the poverty situation in different areas of Lincang, 10 indicators in five dimensions (economic security, health status, education level, living conditions, and social security) were selected. Second, we determined the deprivation threshold value k of each index. The threshold of deprivation is the standard for judging whether a family is poor in the multidimensional poverty conditions. When a family does not reach the threshold of one indicator, the family is considered poor on this indicator and is assigned a value of 1; otherwise 0. Then, the entropy weight method (as shown in 2.2.1) was used to determine the weight of each dimension and each index and to test and judge its rationality. Finally, based on the determined weights of each indicator and the multidimensional poverty threshold k, the multidimensional poverty score of each household was calculated. It mainly calculated the multidimensional poverty incidence (H  ) and the multidimensional poverty intensity index (A  ), and the product of H and A was the MPI value. The formula is as follows:H = q / n     A = â 1 q  W i  C / q      M P I = H Ã A     q   is the population in the state of multidimensional poverty, n   is the total population of the study area, W i    is the weight coefficient in the dimension, â  1 n  W i  = 1   , and C   is the weighted total value of the multidimensional poverty deprivation score.  2.2.3 Cluster identification of poverty groups We extracted data from the poverty-alleviation system and used machine learning to identify poverty groups in multiple dimensions to differentially analyze poverty groups (ZengÂ etÂ al., 2021 ). Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) was used to deal with continuous variables and categorical variables in the poverty-alleviation data (Escofier & PagÃ¨s,Â 1994 ) to obtain a comprehensive poverty-alleviation dimension. Based on the identification of poverty dimensions, we used k-medoids clustering to identify different groups (Park & Jun,Â 2009 ). The k-medoids clustering method is based on real sample points, which are more robust to noise, and the obtained clustering results are more accurate; this is more conducive to the accurate identification of poverty groups (ZengÂ etÂ al., 2021 ). Variance analysis and the GamesâHowell pairwise comparison test were used to analyze differences in attributes among different poverty groups (Sauder & DeMars,Â 2019 ). A chi-squared test was used for the proportional attribute, and the Bonferroni-adjusted z-test was used for the post hoc comparative analysis (Perneger,Â 1998 ) of significantly different poverty groups. Finally, the clustering of different poverty groups was determined.  2.2.4 Spearman's correlation coefficient Spearman's correlation coefficient is used to assess the strength of association between two variables. It is widely used to identify general relationships beyond the linear correlation between two variables. Unlike Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's correlation can capture nonlinear correlations between variables, it does not require the data to be normally distributed, and it is less sensitive to outliers (Hauke & Kossowski,Â 2011 ). Therefore, we used Spearman's correlation coefficient to analyze the relationship between SDGs. Spearman correlation coefficient values (Ï  ) greater than 0.6 indicate synergy (positive association, where progress in one goal promotes progress on the other one) between the two SDGs, and less than â0.6 mean trade-off (negative association, where progress on one goal hinders progress on the other one) between the two SDGs (PradhanÂ etÂ al., 2017 ). Hauke & KossowskiÂ (2011)  suggested to avoid overinterpreting the Spearman correlation coefficient as a measure of the association strength between two variables, so Ï   between â0.6 and 0.6 are unclassified, indicating an unclear synergistic or trade-off relationship between the two goals. This paper further subdivides synergy (Ï  >0.6) into weak synergy (0.6<Ï  <0.7), general synergy (0.7<Ï  <0.8), and strong synergy (Ï  >0.8); trade-off effect (Ï  <â0.6) is subdivided into weak trade-off (â0.7<Ï  <â0.6), general trade-off (â0.8<Ï  <â0.7), and strong trade-off (Ï  <â0.8).  2.2.5 Structural equation modeling (SEM) This study used SEM to explore the effect of poverty on SDGs (Rosseel,Â 2012 ). SEM provides analytical tools for dealing with latent variables that are difficult to observe directly. Compared with traditional regression analysis, SEM has the advantage of being able to deal with multiple dependent variables and consider the influence of measurement errors. It is suitable for dealing with multifactor, multiresult problems with a series of latent variables (HenselerÂ etÂ al., 2015 ). The specific model is as follows:y = Î± + B y + Î  x + Î¾ ,     where y   is an endogenous variable, x   is an exogenous latent variable, B   is the correlation coefficient matrix between the endogenous variables, Î    is the influence coefficient matrix of the exogenous latent variables on the endogenous variables, and Î¾   is the residual matrix.    3 Results 3.1 MPI measurement The MPI value can reflect not only the breadth and intensity of multidimensional poverty but also the degree of deprivation. According to the results in TableÂ 1  , when the deprivation threshold value k Â =Â 1, the poverty incidence rate of farmers in Lincang in 2013 was 0.9126, indicating that 90% of surveyed farmers were deprived on at least one indicator. The share of deprived farmers was 0.4304, and the MPI was 0.3928. Since China's implementation of poverty-alleviation policies in 2013, farmers in Lincang have experienced significant poverty alleviation, with poverty incidence (H), the poverty intensity index (A), and MPI showing a downward trend year by year (Fig.Â 2  ). In 2019, the poverty incidence rate of rural households had decreased to 0.1638, the poverty intensity index to 0.0153, and MPI to 0.0025. By the end of 2020, 94,000 households, 369,000 registered poor people, 562 poor villages, and eight counties (districts) had been lifted out of poverty. Therefore, the poverty incidence rate, poverty intensity index, and MPI all dropped to 0 in 2020.  3.2 Clustering of different poverty groups Using the method described in SectionÂ 2.2.3 , four poverty dimensions were obtained, as shown in TableÂ A4 . Based on the four dimensions of "Family background", "Ethnicity and self-development", "Geographical environment", and "Health and labor force", four clustered groups could be obtained (TableÂ 2  ). There were significant differences among the different clusters. The cluster 1 poverty group was "ethnic minorities and large-scale families". The minority population accounted for the highest proportion in this group, reaching 62.37%. Family size was relatively large, with an average family population of 4.25. The cluster 2 poverty group was "young, with superior geographical conditions", and most in this group were young or middle-aged (58.50%). Compared with other cluster groups, they had better geographical environment conditions; were close to infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, and stations; and had convenient transportation. Many people in this group were migrant workers and nonagricultural workers (68.62%). The cluster 3 poverty group was "old and less educated". There were many elderly people (> 60 years old) in the group, with an average age of 65.42. The level of education was low, with an illiteracy rate of 51.28%. The cluster 4 poverty group was "sick, disabled, and lonely". People in this group had a poor health status, insufficient labor capacity, and few family members. Most in this group were left-behind elderly people.  3.3 SDG index calculation The SDG Index of Lincang from 2013 to 2020 was calculated based on the method described in SectionÂ 2.2.1 . Since the study area does not involve the ocean and lacks relevant data, SDG 14 (life below water) was excluded. As shown in TableÂ A2 , the study area involved 16 goals and 91 indicators (including 58 SDG indicators and 33 localized indicators). And TableÂ A5  shows the statistical information of SDG index values. Fig.Â 3   depicts the temporal trends of SDGs in the study area from 2013 to 2020. Despite volatility, all SDG indices increased over time. There was a significant gap in the SDG scores in 2013; the highest was SDG 4 at 0.3975, and the lowest was SDG 12 at 0.2018. The gap between SDGs gradually narrowed over timeâa trend that accelerated significantly after 2017. In 2020, SDG 1 had the highest score at 0.8650, and SDG 5 had the lowest at 0.7337. When the SDG development level was low, SDGs 6, 8, and 17 were the dominant SDGs. This means many other SDGs would be disproportionately improved as these dominant goals developed (and vice versa). When the SDG development level was relatively high, all SDGs developed in a coordinated manner, and the gap was further narrowed.  3.4 Analysis of the relationships between SDGs Based on the method described in SectionÂ 2.2.4 , Fig.Â 4   (upper right corner) shows the Spearman correlation coefficient between SDGs. Most SDGs were positively correlated while a few, such as SDGs 12, 13, and 15, were significantly negatively correlated with other SDGs. On this basis, we analyzed the synergies and trade-offs between SDGs in the study area, as shown in Fig.Â 4  (lower left corner). SDG 1 was synergistic with most other goals while SDG 12 was frequently associated with other SDGs in trade-offs. There were four pairs of SDGs with strong synergy: SDGs 1 and 2, SDGs 1 and 3, SDGs 2 and 3, and SDGs 2 and 6. Nine pairs had general synergy, and 13 had weak synergy. Eight pairs of SDGs had general trade-offs, and 14 had weak trade-offs. Synergies were found to largely outweigh trade-offs in some SDGs, especially for SDGs 1, 2, 3, and 6. We also identified stronger trade-off effects than synergistic effects for the same goals, mainly SDGs 12, 13, and 15.  3.5 Effect of poverty on SDGs 3.5.1 Dynamic effect of poverty on SDGs We used AMOS 24.0 to construct an SEM to measure the effect of poverty on SDGs (TableÂ 3  ). Regarding different SDGs, poverty had significant positive effects on SDGs 12, 13, and 15 at the 10% significance level and had different degrees of hindrance effects on most other SDGs. SDGs 5, 16, and 17 were not significantly negatively affected by poverty. From the perspective of time, poverty's negative effect on SDGs weakened over time. This could be attributable to the promotion of sustainable development and the implementation of poverty-alleviation policies, which helped alleviate the impeding effect of poverty on SDGs.  3.5.2 Average effect of poverty on different cluster groups We used MPI as the causal variable and the average index of each SDG over the years as the outcome variable, aiming to explore the average effect of poverty on the sustainable development of different cluster groups (TableÂ 4  ). In general, except for SDG 15, poverty had an inhibitory effect on the sustainable development of different cluster groups, but the average effect degree differed. As an indicator directly related to poverty, SDG 1 was the most negatively affected by poverty among all SDGs while SDG 11 was not sensitive to MPI.  3.5.3 Effect of poverty on synergies and trade-offs between SDGs Based on our analysis in SectionÂ 3.4 , we used MPI as a mediating variable to further study poverty's effects on synergies and trade-offs among SDGs. TablesÂ 5   and 6   show the effects of multidimensional poverty on synergy and trade-off relationships among SDGs, respectively. Direct effect refers to direct interaction between SDGs, indirect effect refers to the indirect interaction of SDGs under the influence of the mediator variable MPI, and the total effect is the sum of direct and indirect effects. At the 10% statistical level, the vast majority of SDGs as causal variables had significant positive effects on the direct effects of SDGs as outcome variables, further verifying the synergies between them. After adding MPI as a mediator to the model, the indirect effect coefficients were all negative, suggesting that poverty impeded the positive association between SDG 1 and other SDGs. Not only was this inhibitory effect found in SDG 1, which is directly related to poverty, but poverty also hindered synergies among SDGs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and others, thus weakening synergies between SDGs. In particular, among the pairs of SDGs with synergistic effects between SDGs 1 and 7, 2 and 8, and 3 and 8, MPI subverted the relationships between them, changing them from synergies to trade-offs. TableÂ 6  shows the effect of poverty on the trade-offs among SDGs. The results showed that the direct effects between SDGs 12, 13, 15, and others were significantly negative, further indicating trade-offs between SDGs 12, 13, 15, and others. With MPI as the mediating variable, the indirect effects between SDG 12 and SDGs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11 were significantly negative. The indirect effects between SDG 13 and SDGs 1, 7, and 10 were significantly negative. The indirect effects between SDG 15 and SDGs 1 and 2 were significantly negative. Lastly, the indirect effects between SDG 2 and SDGs 11, 9, and 10 were significantly negative. At the 10% statistical level, the indirect effect between SDGs 3 and 13 was significantly positive (0.096), and the total effect was negative (â0.014). This suggests that in periods of low economic development and high poverty rates, good health and well-being and climate action are not sharply contradictory and may even be synergistic. However, with the substantial reduction of poverty and the improvement of living standards, people's production and lifestyle habits will negatively affect the environment, which in turn threatens human well-being and health (RoyÂ etÂ al., 2021 ; Soergel,Â KrieglerÂ and Bodirsky, 2021 ).    4 Discussion 4.1 Impeding effect of poverty on SDGs The impeding effect of poverty on SDGs significantly differed among the targets, and the effect also vary across development periods. In particular, the effect of poverty on SDG 12 was positive before 2017 and negative after 2017. This shows that in the early stage when the poverty rate was high and the SDG Index level was low in Lincang, the contradiction between economic growth and production and consumption patterns was not sharp. At that time, poverty objectively causes people's low utilization intensity and ability of natural resources. With rapid economic development and the alleviation of extreme poverty in the study area, however, poverty gradually became an impediment to sustainable consumption and production. Poverty objectively impedes people's ability to apply cleaner production technologies. Responsible consumption and production patterns can drive economic development, but current resource use patterns are overly reliant on the natural environment and continue to have devastating effects on the planet (JohnssonÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). Lincang's abundant natural resources provide advantages for its development, but it also tends to form the path of resource-dependent growth. Sustainable consumption and production means doing more and better with fewer resources. It also means removing the link between economic growth and environmental degradation, improving resource efficiency, and promoting sustainable lifestyles. Production and consumption patterns must be changed to coordinate environmental, economic, and social development and promote the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature (WackernagelÂ etÂ al., 2017 ). The COVID-19 pandemic has posed huge challenges to the implementation of SDGs, making the obstacles of poverty to SDGs even more formidable. Under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the poorer populations are facing greater obstacles to their sustainable development. The COVID-19 pandemic is driving up poverty and inequality (ZhaoÂ etÂ al., 2022 ). Nonetheless, we should be aware that the pandemic also offers opportunities for sustainable development transformation, including lessons learned from planning and action, socio-economic recovery plans, and the use of information and communication technologies (PradhanÂ etÂ al., 2021 ). Poverty-specific programmes and actions, like the economic recovery plan of the pandemic, can directly shift regions towards more sustainable development through their own environmentally friendly behaviours and development path choices. How to seize the opportunity under the influence of the epidemic environment and break through the bottleneck of sustainable development is worthy of further research.  4.2 Heterogeneous effect of poverty on different cluster groups The study area Lincang is a multi-ethnic and underdeveloped region. The empirical results showed that poverty had an inhibitory effect on the sustainable development of different cluster groups, but the effect was heterogeneous. There have been studies dividing SDGs into human well-being goals (society), including SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 16; basic condition goals (economy), including SDGs 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12; and natural environment goals (ecology), including SDGs 13, 14, and 15 (FuÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; Ge,Â LiÂ and Cheng, 2022 ). SDG 17 alone acted as a means of execution (Fig.Â A1 ). In our study, poverty had significant negative effects on human well-being goals, basic condition goals, and natural environment goals for cluster 1. This was mainly because cluster 1 mostly comprised ethnic minorities living in an underdeveloped area with large families. Extreme poverty will adversely affect their living environment and production conditions, thus hindering their sustainable development. Poverty had a significant inhibitory effect on the basic conditional goals of cluster 2. Group 2 had the highest proportion of young and middle-aged people. The negative effect of poverty on the geographical environment and traffic conditions will hamper their survival and development. Cluster 3 had the highest proportion of aging people and low educational levels. Poverty can worsen their living conditions, with clear negative effects on human well-being goals. Poverty had a significant inhibitory effect on human well-being goals and basic condition goals for cluster 4. People in group 4 suffered from disease, had the highest proportion of disabled people, and had thin family populations. Poverty severely restricts their survival and development and hinders SDG achievement. Given the heterogeneous effect of poverty on different groups, regional policies should reflect targeting and differentiation. Policy optimization for heterogeneous groups will benefit the sustainable development of less developed regions.  4.3 Poverty inhibits synergies and magnifies trade-offs between SDGs According to the empirical results, poverty inhibits synergies and promotes trade-offs between SDGs, and turnes synergies into trade-offs between individual SDGs. We elaborate on the possible mechanisms below. Poverty is an incentive for unsustainable economic development (MÃ¤ler,Â 1998 ). On the one hand, high-quality production factors that promote economic development tend to cluster in economically developed and highly profitable regions. As a result, poor areas lose their resource advantages for promoting sustainable economic development. On the other hand, the quality of labor in poverty-stricken areas is low, and low-level labor can only be exchanged for low-level income. Low income makes it difficult to increase demand, hindering national economic development (WarcholdÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). These factors are intertwined and undoubtedly hinder the achievement of economic sustainability. At the same time, problems such as weak environmental awareness, extensive production, and poverty-related lifestyle also hinder the sustainable and coordinated development of the economy. Poverty hinders the sustainable development of human capital and is a major source of social disharmony (PiffÂ etÂ al., 2020 ). In the labor market, the poor have low labor productivity, little remuneration, and poor economic conditions. People in poverty-stricken areas also hold outdated ideas; lack the confidence and determination to start businesses; have difficulty accepting new knowledge, new ideas, and new things; and lack attention to climate change and environmental protection (McAreavey & Brown,Â 2019 ). These often cause populations in impoverished areas to fall into a vicious circle of "poverty - low population quality - conservative thinking - poverty". The relatively low level of income and treatment in poor areas is the main reason for the weak development of education, science, and technology. This in turn leads to low productivity in poverty-stricken areas and exacerbates poverty. These factors interact with each other, becoming the main culprit hindering sustainable social development. Poverty also contributes to environmental problems to some extent (Duraiappah,Â 1998 ). The poverty, population, environment (PPE) strange circle theory explains the intercausal relationships among poverty, population, and environment (Dasgupta,Â 1995 ). Specifically, it refers to the vicious circle of "povertyâpopulation growthâenvironmental degradation." The basic principle of the PPE cycle is that with excessive population growth, under existing development capabilities, poverty will arise when the available environment and resources are not enough to meet people's needs. At that time, per capita resources are reduced, the number of unemployed people increases, per capita income is reduced, and social facilities are insufficient. At the same time, environmental problems arise, such as air pollution, overcultivation of land resources, overcutting of forests, overgrazing of pastures, water pollution, soil erosion, and salinization, which can lead to increases in natural disasters (FlÃ¶rkeÂ etÂ al., 2019 ). The interaction between poverty and the environment is one in which the immediate survival needs of poor people overwhelm the long-term needs of environmental protection, resulting in ignorance about environmental problems and the long-term consequences of behaviors (i.e., the effect of poverty on the environment). The deterioration of the environment adversely affects human survival and development (i.e., the influence of the environment on poverty). Poverty can therefore be considered a main factor restricting the sustainable development of the environment.   5 Conclusions Taking Lincang as the research area, this study explores the role of poverty and how it poses a central barrier in the implementation of the SDGs in underdeveloped regions. After calculating 16 SDG indices and the MPI of poverty groups, we further analyzed the heterogeneous effects of poverty on different poverty groups and the mechanism of poverty on synergies and trade-offs among SDGs. The results showed the following: (1) The impeding effect of poverty on SDGs significantly differed among the targets. Although the negative effect of poverty on SDGs weakened over time, the degree of the negative effect differed in different development periods. (2) Because of differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of poverty groups, the effect of poverty on the sustainable development of different clusters was heterogeneous. This was manifested in different degrees of effect on the economic, social, and ecological SDGs of different poverty groups. (3) As a mediating variable, MPI might have inhibited synergies between SDGs, magnified trade-offs between them, and subverted the relationships between individual SDGs (i.e., synergies became trade-offs). Our research has implications for SDGs realization in less developed areas like Lincang. Sustainability is not just about achieving the 17 SDGs but about the process of moving forward (WeitzÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). SDGs are interconnected, mutually reinforcing, and competing (BaliÂ Swain & Ranganathan,Â 2021 ). Meeting SDG targets largely depends on whether synergies between goals can be fully exploited. Furthermore, prominent trade-offs pose barriers to achieving the SDGs, requiring a deeper reform of current strategies to leave SDGs structurally unencumbered (AllenÂ etÂ al., 2021 ). Poverty is a common problem faced by all countries in the world and cannot be ignored. It restricts the sustainable economic, social, and environmental development. Therefore, eradicating poverty is of great significance for implementing sustainable development strategies. At the same time, the concept of sustainable development should be used to guide underdeveloped areas to eradicate poverty. In eradicating poverty, human, economic, and natural resources need to be coordinated to achieve the SDGs. Poverty eradication must go hand in hand with a range of sustainable development strategies, including promoting economic growth; addressing social needs for education, health, social protection, and employment; curbing climate change; and protecting the environment (HainesÂ etÂ al., 2017 ; NhamoÂ etÂ al., 2019 ; Yamasaki & Yamada,Â 2022 ). Further, policymakers need to focus on flexibly applying policies during different development periods and formulating targeted measures for different poverty groups (MasudaÂ etÂ al., 2022 ; KyprianouÂ etÂ al., 2022 ). This will help promote synergies between SDGs and alleviate trade-offs to achieve sustainable development. This study makes a useful exploration of how progress towards SDGs realization can be documented and assessed in underdeveloped area. However, the current research on SDGs still has the problem of imperfect data system, which hinders the quantification of SDG progress (AllenÂ etÂ al., 2018 ). Quantifying the progress of SDGs is crucial for tracking global sustainable development efforts and guiding the formulation and implementation of policies. This provides a direction for future research on SDGs.
