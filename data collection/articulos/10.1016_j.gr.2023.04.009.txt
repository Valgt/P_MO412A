                  Climate control is one of the important targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which along with other SDGs plays an imperative role in environmental sustainability strategies. Recently, studies on the driving forces of climate change and environmental quality focus on using environmental indicators like CO2 and ecological footprint (EF). Evidently, CO2 emissions have been criticized on the ground that they cannot indicate environmental deterioration to a large extent. EF also focuses only on the consumption of resources and overlooks biocapacity (supply side). The adoption of green energy, which is the fundamental agenda of SDG 7, is the most practical solution toward energy transition and controlling fossil fuel consumption. Also, human-induced environmental challenges require considering factors like education and awareness to cultivate a green society. Against this background, this study employs the load capacity factor (LCF), which considers both supply and demand sides to gauge the environmental quality, and inspects the human capital (HUC), green energy (GEN), and environmental quality nexus using the data from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) from 1986 to 2018 in the context of the load capacity curve (LCC) hypothesis. Results of the cross-sectionally augmented ARDL, robust to heterogeneity, fractional integration, endogeneity, and cross-sectional dependence (CSD), established that the load capacity curve holds in the context of ASEAN. Thus, achieving a higher income level will support ASEAN to expand LCF and increase environmental quality. HUC is found to expand LCF and promote environmental quality. Similarly, green energy is found to stimulate LCF. However, population density and economic globalization expand environmental deterioration. The paper is concluded by providing detailed policies to enhance environmental quality.

Recently, studies on the driving forces of climate change and environmental quality focus on using environmental indicators like CO2  and ecological footprint (EF). Evidently, CO2  emissions have been criticized on the ground that they cannot indicate environmental deterioration to a large extent. EF also focuses only on the consumption of resources and overlooks biocapacity (supply side). The adoption of green energy, which is the fundamental agenda of SDG 7, is the most practical solution toward energy transition and controlling fossil fuel consumption. Also, human-induced environmental challenges require considering factors like education and awareness to cultivate a green society. Against this background, this study employs the load capacity factor (LCF), which considers both supply and demand sides to gauge the environmental quality, and inspects the human capital (HUC), green energy (GEN), and environmental quality nexus using the data from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) from 1986 to 2018 in the context of the load capacity curve (LCC) hypothesis. Results of the cross-sectionally augmented ARDL, robust to heterogeneity, fractional integration, endogeneity, and cross-sectional dependence (CSD), established that the load capacity curve holds in the context of ASEAN. Thus, achieving a higher income level will support ASEAN to expand LCF and increase environmental quality. HUC is found to expand LCF and promote environmental quality. Similarly, green energy is found to stimulate LCF. However, population density and economic globalization expand environmental deterioration. The paper is concluded by providing detailed policies to enhance environmental quality.   Keywords Green energy  Load capacity curve  Human capital  Economic globalization  Environmental sustainability    1 Introduction It has been well established that climate change, greenhouse gases (GHGs), and related increases in Earth's temperature are some downsides of economic development (Doğan et al., 2021; Sinha et al., 2020 ). The importance of economic development cannot be denied; however, if the development is unsustainable, its environmental repercussions can be severe, which may put the entire planet at risk of collapse (Liu et al., 2023; Sinha et al., 2020 ). Sustainable development implies a development pattern that could effectively satisfy the current demands of the human population without forfeiting the capabilities of future generations to fulfill their respective demands (Dogan and Pata, 2022 ; Ahmad et al., 2023a ). From this perspective, the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development provides 17 goals, which all UN member nations are required to pursue as an urgent call for action. The attainment of these SDGs can pave the way toward sustainable growth by eliminating the imbalance in economic growth and environmental sustainability. To formulate effective sustainable development plans, the recent literature has started to focus on unfolding the drivers of environmental deterioration in the context of SDGs. In this scenario, studies have used CO2  emissions (Caglar and Mert, 2022; Chishti et al., 2023; Chishti and Sinha, 2022; Dogan et al., 2022; Farooq et al., 2022; Ullah et al., 2020; Weimin et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022b; Xu et al., 2022c; Xue et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022 ) and EF (Alvarado et al., 2021; Destek and Sinha, 2020; Pata, 2021a; Sharif et al., 2020 ) as response variables since these two indicators can explain the environmental deterioration up to some extent. Notably, CO2  is criticized by scholars on the ground that it only assesses the influences of energy use since emissions are largely produced by fossil fuel combustion (Al-Mulali et al., 2015; Destek and Sinha, 2020; Ozturk et al., 2016 ; Ahmad et al., 2023b ). Unlike CO2 , EF represents the demands of the human being for natural resources by considering six land use types (Lin et al., 2016 ). Indeed, the EF is a very comprehensive indicator for representing the demand side but it ignores the supply side, which is indicated by the resources’ availability (biocapacity). Biocapacity depicts the capacity of the planet to produce useful resources and absorb waste (Lin et al., 2016 ). Thus, ignoring biocapacity (supply side) may cause an inadequate assessment of environmental deterioration (Shang et al., 2022 ). On this ground, the study of Siche et al. (2010)  highlighted the necessity to compute the LCF by dividing biocapacity over the EF for a more effective and holistic environmental assessment. Recently, scholars have started to employ the LCF in environmental studies on the view that it is an effective and holistic proxy to measure environmental quality. Moreover, based on the concept of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), Dogan and Pata, (2022)  suggested that the LCF decreases due to environmental challenges at early stages of growth; however, development after a certain level can help to stimulate the LCF. This linkage leads to develop the load capacity curve (LCC), which represents a U-shaped nexus between economic growth and LCF. This works aims at exploring the associations between human capital, green energy, and LCF by using the concept of the LCC. This topic is relevant for designing policies regarding climate action (SDG target 13) as well as SDG 7 (affordable green energy). Although the world has recognized the importance of energy conservation and diversification strategies, the energy sector of nations still predominantly uses fossil fuels, which pose adverse impacts on environmental sustainability (Afshan et al., 2022 ). The available answer to this challenge lies in the utilization of green energy, for instance, hydro, solar, wind, bioenergy, geothermal, etc., as these sources are clean compared to fossil fuels (Zafar et al., 2021 ). Hence, expanding the generation and consumption of green energy can curtail the share of pollutant fossil fuels’ (Tang et al., 2022 ); accordingly, it is the ultimate strategy to maintain a balance between development and environmental sustainability. This strategy, which is also highlighted in SDG 7, can impact the ability of the nations to pursue SDG 13. Although these two SDGs (SDG 7 & 13) are critical for environmental sustainability, the selection of the LCF makes this study somewhat relevant for policymaking in the context of some other SDGs including Life on land (target 15) and below water (target 14), sustainable cities & communities (target 11), and responsible production & consumption (target 12) since the use of both EF and biocapacity can help to capture multiple fronts of environmental quality. The challenges of climate change and unsustainable development are difficult to combat without focusing on enhancing the education level and related environmental awareness. In this context, human capital is acknowledged as an important influencing factor in climate-related changes and mitigation efforts since it is gauged by using the schooling years along with returns to education. In the literature, some studies found a stimulating role of education in influencing people’s behavior to use green energy products (Chankrajang and Muttarak, 2017 ), participate in recycling activities (Zen et al., 2014 ), follow environmental laws (Desha et al., 2015 ), and limit deforestation trends (Godoy et al., 1998 ). Also, some studies suggest that HUC can help to improve the quality of the environment (Ahmed et al., 2020a; Hao et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021; Zafar et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021 ). However, some studies provide empirical evidence suggesting that enhancing education boosts consumption due to a possible rise in the purchasing power of individuals, and thus, HUC intensifies the deterioration of the environment (Ahmed et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022 ). In addition to these disagreements in the past literature, the use of traditional environmental degradation proxies that ignore the supply side (biocapacity) motivates authors to re-examine the environmental impacts of HUC by using the LCF as a holistic indicator of ecological sustainability. Thus, this research evaluates the role of HUC in environmental quality including green energy in the empirical model using the concept of the LCC in ASEAN. Growing demand for energy resources (i.e approximately 50 % since 2000) and mounting economic growth trends (over 5 % per year) have made ASEAN a hot spot of environmental degradation (Phong, 2019 ). The majority of member nations in the ASEAN suffer from ecological deficits and the prevailing biocapacity crunch has increased the environmental deterioration in the region (Wang et al., 2023 ). The distribution of load capacity factor in Fig. 1   indicates the LCF values below 1 in all six members of ASEAN suggesting that these countries suffer from poor environmental quality in 2018. Notably, the LCF values of 1 and above show that the biocapacity of a nation is sufficient to meet its consumption needs. Thus, we can say that the values of LCF higher than 1 denote better environmental quality, which is not valid in the case of our sample data. It is important to mention that the EF of ASEAN is 2.77 gha per person while the biocapacity of the entire world (on average) is only 1.63 gha per person (GFN, 2022 ). In addition, the exploitation of natural resources, particularly fossil fuels, and considerably lower use of clean energy have made ASEAN the third-largest CO2 -generating region (Nathaniel and Khan, 2020 ). Thus, there is a need to explore some new dimensions in the economic growth-environmental quality nexus and suggest holistic policies to maintain a balance between growth and environment in the ASEAN. Against these settings, this research contributes to the literature on LCF by probing the nexus between human capital, green energy, and LCF in the context of ASEAN. The available studies on LCF have not analyzed the role of HUC in LCF for ASEAN. In addition, this study also uncovers the LCC hypothesis in the context of HUC and green energy, which is overlooked by previous studies. The investigation of the LCC hypothesis in the context of HUC and green energy is significant as it will help to suggest growth strategies to realign development and environmental strategies. Besides, the aim of the study is realized by using the CS-ARDL test which provides long-run results robust against non-stationarity, heterogeneity, misspecification bias, cross-sectional dependency, and endogeneity issues.  2 Literature review Environmental challenges are substantially increasing around the world along with development, and therefore, the literature linking environmental quality with economic growth and other possible determinants is on a rise. In this context, scholars have focused on using a suitable measure of environmental degradation that could represent environmental degradation up to a large extent. Even though CO2  emissions with a dominant share of GHGs were increasingly used in the early environmental studies to represent the degradation of the environment, the criticism on CO2  as a narrow measure of environmental deterioration increased the use of EF, which gauges environmental deterioration by considering various land used areas (Ahmed et al., 2020b; Al-Mulali et al., 2016; Charfeddine, 2017; Ozturk et al., 2016 ). EF is a useful indicator to apprehend the impacts of the consumption side; however, Earth’s resource generation capacity (biocapacity) is an important factor from the supply side that should be considered to compute a comprehensive indicator of environmental quality. Keeping this in view, the study of Siche et al. (2010)  suggested considering both the supply and consumption side and measuring the environmental quality by dividing EF over biocapacity. This new measure was named as the LCF, and some scholars investigated the impacts of different factors on LCF for effective environmental policies. Some of these studies are discussed below: Using the data from Japan and the USA, Pata (2021b)  indicated that health expenditure and renewables boost LCF only in the US, while in the case of Japan spending on health improves environmental quality but not the HUC. They also noted that economic growth mitigates LCF but renewables have no considerable effect on LCF in the case of Japan. In another study, Pata and Isik (2021)  evidenced that energy intensity, income, and natural resources mitigate LCF and thereby upsurge environmental degradation in China. However, boosting the levels of human capital improves LCF. The study of Khan et al. (2022)  found that renewables can stimulate LCF in E7 and G7 nations while population and economic growth reduce LCF. Nevertheless, the impacts of variables vary for both country groups. In the same vein, Akadiri et al. (2022)  illustrated the favorable impacts of renewables and financial globalization on load capacity factor in India; however, they also found that economic development lessens LCF. In the case of Thailand, Adebayo et al. (2022)  designed a comparative research on the determinants of LCF, CO2 , and EF. Their findings revealed that export, import, income, and natural resources boost the quality of the environment. However, the validity of the pollution haven effect is sensitive to the choice of the environmental indicator. Shang et al. (2022)  found that health expenditures and renewables improve the LCF in the case of ASEAN while economic development curbs LCF. Awosusi et al. (2022)  used data from South Africa and established that energy use lessens LCF while technology and globalization boost LCF. Similarly, Liu et al. (2022)  explored the data from South Africa and established that technology and renewables boost LCF levels while energy use and growth reduce LCF. Surprisingly, the research of Xu et al. (2022a)  demonstrated that both green energy and fossil energy reduce LCF while financial globalization expands it in Brazil. Although the above-discussed studies revealed various influencing factors of LCF, they assume the linear impact of growth on LCF and ignored the use of the quadratic term of income to observe the load capacity curve. However, the impressive study of Dogan and Pata (2022)  revealed the LCC hypothesis in the case of G7 as they found a U-shaped relation between income and LCF indicating that higher income levels boost LCF. They also established that ICT, research & development, and green energy boost LCF. The comparative study of Pata and Kartal (2022)  used the LCF, EF, and CO2  in the case of South Korea and found that LCC and EKC hold in South Korea. However, renewables do not impact these environmental indicators. From the above literature, it can be seen that previous studies have not evaluated the impact of both HUC and green energy on LCF in the LCC framework. Human capital is composed of two factors i.e., schooling years that depict education levels and returns on education. Education is a vital parameter to enhance environmental awareness, which can motivate people to follow environmental rules and regulations (Desha et al., 2015 ) and adopt green energy products (Chankrajang and Muttarak, 2017 ). Educated people tend to participate more in recycling activities (Zen et al., 2014 ). According to Isiksal et al. (2022) , educated people from Central Asia play a positive role in curbing CO2  emissions, and thereby, HUC mitigates CO2  in the region. Analyzing the data from 20 OECD nations, Yao et al. (2020)  highlighted some vital social benefits of human capital investments that decrease the environmental pollution. Using the data from the emerging group of nations, the study of Huang et al. (2022)  revealed that HUC is inversely connected with CO2  and thus, the spread of emissions can be controlled by increasing HUC. In the context of European nations, Saqib et al. (2023)  unveiled that HUC and FDI can be used to decrease EF and boost ecological quality. Likewise, the research of Liao et al. (2019)  noticed that investment in education upsurges sustainable growth in the Guangdong province of China. Similar positive impacts of education on environmental quality were noticed by some other empirical studies in different countries and panels (Ahmed et al., 2020a; Lan et al., 2012; Pata and Caglar, 2021; Salim et al., 2017 ). In contrast, Sapkota and Bastola (2017)  established that the effect of HUC on the environment varies according to income levels. However, the studies of Zhou et al. (2022)  illustrated that HUC decreases environmental quality. Ahmed et al. (2021)  also presented a different view by estimating the panel data from nations located in Latin America and the Caribbean region. They disclosed that HUC escalates environmental pollution because educated people tend to earn higher incomes and consequently, the increased purchasing power of people improves their lifestyle and boosts their consumption levels. Similarly, the research of Zafar et al. (2020)  disclosed that education stimulates CO2  in the panel of Asian countries. Thus, it is unrealistic to assume that HUC will improve the quality of the environment as there are no efforts from many countries to update educational curricula by focusing on environmental awareness. Summing up, conflicting arguments regarding the impacts of HUC on environmental quality, lack of literature on HUC and LCF, and insufficient research studies on load capacity curve motivated authors to examine the impacts of HUC and green energy on LCF following the LCC framework in the sample of ASEAN.  3 Data and methodology The theoretical foundation of this research came from the concept of the EKC, which in the case of LCF is termed as the LCC by Pata and Kartal (2022) and Dogan and Pata (2022) . These studies argue that LCF is the proxy of environmental quality, and thus, the negative association between LCF and income holds at early stages of growth but increases in income boost LCF at a higher level of income. To put it simply, the U-shaped curve between economic growth and LCF is expected to hold, and therefore, it is unreasonable to use the linear form of economic growth in the model. HUC is computed by using the data on education as well as the returns to education, and education is a significant driver of environmental awareness. In this connection, HUC can cultivate a sense of environmental awareness, and thus, organizations and people may adopt energy and resource conservation strategies (Desha et al., 2015 ). Owing to environmental consciousness, governments may implement strong environmental laws. Hence, the quality of the environment can be improved due to the improvement in HUC (Ahmed et al., 2020a ). In contrast, a gain in income due to the improvement in education paves the way to increase the consumption of resources because people tend to boost their consumption activities with a rise in purchasing power. Also, countries are not focusing on reshaping their academic curricula to increase environmental awareness. Thus, HUC may even decrease LCF by supporting consumption-oriented lifestyles (Ahmed et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022 ). HUC can also promote the environmental consciousness required at a higher income level to attain the LCC since development in the absence of ecological awareness and strong ecological laws may not increase LCF at the initial stages. Likewise, the adoption of green energy is another necessary factor to attain the load capacity curve by boosting the level of LCF. Employing green energy sources is the most effective strategy to limit the utilization of fossil fuels (Afshan et al., 2022; Chishti and Dogan, 2022 ). Population density (PDT) has also a close connection with the increase in environmental degradation since an increase in PDT can boost transportation, construction, and other activities leading to increased resource consumption (Rasool et al., 2019 ). Against these theoretical arguments, the study develops the following model:(1) ( L L C F )  it   = φ 0  + ϑ 1  L G R it   + ϑ 2  ( L G R )  it  2  + ϑ 3  L G E N it    + ϑ 4  L H U C it    + ϑ 5  L P D T it     + μ it          where LCF denotes the load capacity factor (Biocapacity/EF in gha per person) which measures the environmental quality. The variables GR (measured by GDP constant 2015 US $ per person) and GR2  are used to estimate the presence of LCC and they indicate the economic growth (per person) and the square of the growth, respectively. GEN is the green energy per person (aggregate of energy from various sources including wind, hydropower, solar, wave, geothermal, bioenergy, and tidal in kWh) and HUC is the human capital computed on the basis of education (schooling years) and returns to education. The PDT describes the population density (number of people per sq. km of land) and µ symbolizes the residual term. In the second model, EG (economic globalization) is also added to check whether the findings of the empirical analysis are robust to the addition of a new variable. EG can boost the consumption of resources by increasing international trade since globalization provides new avenues to export products (Saud et al., 2020 ). This may reduce the levels of LCF in the nations. Conversely, nations can avail the opportunity to update their technology with the help of international trade which may upsurge LCF. After adding the EG, the modified form of the model is given below.(2) ( L L C F )  it   = φ 0  + ϑ 1  L G R it   + ϑ 2  ( L G R )  it  2  + ϑ 3  L G E N it    + ϑ 4  L H U C it    + ϑ 5  L P D T it     + ϑ 6  L E G it   + μ it           This work collected data from 1986 to 2018 since the data on LCF and GR for some nations are unavailable before and after this period. The regressors as well as the response variable are converted into the logarithm form to improve the consistency of the analysis. The datasets for LCF and GEN came from GFN (2022) and OWD (2022) , respectively. The data on HUC is based on the human capital index and it came from Penn World Tables (version 10) (Feenstra et al., 2015 ). For EG (economic globalization), the index of EG constructed by Gygli et al. (2019)  is used. Datasets for the remaining variables, including GR and PDT, were collected from WDI (2022) . 3.1 Econometric methodology This research collected the panel data from 1986 to 2018, and consistent with the previous panel studies, the estimation began with the investigation of CSD. This step is among the critical preliminary steps of panel data estimation which reduces the chances of biased results by facilitating the selection of a suitable methodology for the empirical analysis. Thus, this research used the LM and CD tests of Breusch-Pagan and Pesaran, respectively, to assess the CSD in the variables. After this, the Pesaran scaled LM and Bias-corrected scaled LM methods are also used to ensure that the results are robust. The CD test is expressed below:(3) CDOP = 2 r  z ( z - 1 )    ∑ i = 1  z - 1   ∑ j = i + 1  z  O ⌢  ij           where CDOP indicates the CD test of Pesaran, r indicates time, z shows the size of the sample, and O ⌢  ij     displays pair-wise correlation. Despite the importance of checking the CSD in panel data, it is not the only issue that could influence the selection of empirical strategy since heterogeneity can also impact the performance of panel econometric estimators. In this context, the study of Pesaran and Yamagata (2008)  suggested two tests (Adjusted Delta & Delta) to assess the slope homogeneity. If the slope is not homogeneous, the methodology adopted in the next steps must not assume slope homogeneity in data. Afterward, the unit roots tests are applied keeping in view the CSD and heterogeneity, which was found in the early steps. The conventional unit root tests are extensively used in panel data analysis; however, their application requires homogeneous data with the absence of CSD. Pesaran (2007)  suggests that the cross-sectional IPS (CIPS) test can efficiently identify the stationarity level even when the slope is heterogeneous and CSD exists. Also, the cross-sectional ADF (CADF) test offers the same benefits and is popular in identifying the correct integration level of variables in panel data. The test equation of CADF is given below:(4) Δ z it   = ϑ i  + φ i  Y it - 1   + δ i  Y  ¯   t - 1   + ∑ j = 0  L  δ ij   Δ Y  ¯   it - 1   + ∑ j = 0  L  c ij   Δ Y it - 1   + μ it        where Yit , ϑ  , and µit  refer to the variable estimated, intercept, and error term, respectively. In addition, L depicts the lag length, and Y  ¯   t - 1    &Δ Y  ¯   it - 1      shows the cross-sectional average. The alternative (hypothesis) of this method is generally accepted if not less than one of the individuals becomes stationary compared to the null hypothesis that requires all non-stationary individuals for its acceptance. To compute the Pesaran CIPS (PCIPS) test, the following equation can be used:(5) PCIPS = 1 n  ∑ i = 1  n  PCAD F i        where PCADF means Pesaran CADF, which takes the t-statistics of φi   from Eq. (4) . After this, the long-run association is assessed by using the Pedroni (1999)  method which comprises three-group and four-panel tests. These seven statistics are divided into “between dimensions” (Group ADF, PP, rho) and “within dimensions” (Panel ADF, rho, PP, v) statistics. If the majority of statistics are significant, the long-run association can be concluded based on the Pedroni test. Although this test handles heterogeneity issues, it may not able to decide cointegration correctly during CD. Keeping in view the weakness of the Pedroni test regarding the data exhibiting CSD, this research took advantage of Westerlund's (2008)  technique, which is composed of dh-g and dh-p tests, where the former is a group-based test while the latter is a panel based test. These tests utilize common factors and this technique is based on the principle of Durbin-Hausman. The ability of this method to simultaneously consider CSD and heterogeneity along with robustness in the case of endogeneity and stationary regressor makes it a preferable choice in panel data analysis of cointegration. However, the Westerlund (2007)  technique is also applied to check the results. This test is a combination of group and panel-based tests and the probability values of these tests are produced by using the process of bootstrapping. Thus, this test possesses better small sample analyzing properties and the outcomes of this method are valid during heterogeneity and CSD. After this, the long-run estimation is initiated by using the popular CS-ARDL test of Chudik et al. (2016) . Heterogeneous panel datasets exhibiting CSD require a reliable estimator like CS-ARDL that could address not only heterogeneity and CSD but also solve residual correlation and endogeneity problems. The CS-ARDL is expressed below:(6) Δ L C F i , t   = ϑ i  + ∑ j = 1  p  δ it   Δ L C F i , t - j   + ∑ j = 0  p  δ ij  ′   V A E i , t - j   + ∑ j = 0  p  δ it  ′  C  ¯   t - j   + ε i , t             where C  ¯   t  = ( Δ LCF   ¯   t ,   VAE   ¯   t ′  )  ′     shows the average of cross-section, LCF shows the response variable, and VAE depicts regressors. This test tolerates fractional integration and also generates short-run results along with estimating the long-run effects of variables. Next, as an alternative methodology, the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) test is used. The comparative analysis of Phillips and Moon (1999)  indicated that the OLS test demonstrated small sample bias in panel data analysis compared to the FMOLS which exhibited better performance. Thus, the FMOLS test is a reliable method for analyzing panel data. This non-parametric technique can even address autocorrelation and endogeneity concerns. Considering the heterogeneity of data, the heterogeneous specification is used to produce long-run coefficients robust to heterogeneity. These tests were followed with the application of Dumitrescu and Hurlin's (2012)  causal estimation to reveal the directions of causality in the modeled variables. This causality test is robust in the case of CSD, heterogeneity, T > N, T < N, and small samples (Dumitrescu and Hurlin, 2012 ). The methodology flow chart of this research is given in Fig. 2  .   4 Results and discussion Before performing the empirical analysis, descriptive statistics of LCF and regressors are computed. These statistics are presented in Fig. 3   (box plots) and Table 1  . In Fig. 3 , the lower and upper values of data (minimum and maximum) are depicted by lower and upper lines, respectively. The mean and median are indicated by square and circle, respectively. The mean value for LCF is 0.6313 which is well below the value of 1. This low value shows that ASEAN cannot sustain the consumption needs of the population from the biocapacity available in the region. A relatively high maximum value of LCF (1.8778) arises due to the higher resources and lower consumption needs before the year 2000 in some member nations. However, the situation of ecological deficit holds from 2000 to onward in almost every member of ASEAN. Green energy exhibits a minimum level of 0.063 and a maximum level of 2.3551 per person kWh. Further details of GEN for individual nations in Fig. 4   demonstrate that the consumption of GEN sources increased over the span of analysis in every nation. However, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand have consumed more GEN compared to other nations in recent years. GR indicates a high mean value (9101.418) and a high standard deviation since growth levels have significantly expanded in the region over the span of the study. Likewise, the level of HUC indicated by the values of the human capital index has also expanded throughout the period of study. HUC trends are also presented in Fig. 5  . Economic globalization expanded in the region and the mean value remained over 63 from 1985 to 2018. Likewise, PDT has massively expanded in the region with a standard deviation higher than all other variables. Interestingly, most of the selected indicators increased in the region except for LCF which reduced in most nations indicating a deteriorating situation of environmental quality. Next, tests were employed in Table 2   to evaluate the situation of possible CSD in the data. The findings generated by the CD test demonstrated CSD in every selected variable. Results were not found to be different when the LM test was employed. Although both tests depicted CSD in the panel, the study also adopted the Pesaran scaled LM and Bias-corrected scaled LM methods to ensure the validity of the results. The findings of both these tests confirmed the preceding outcomes of CSD. Thus, LCF and other variables show a higher degree of regional dependence. Understanding the nature of panel data is essential before proceeding to the next step. Hence, it is relevant to know whether the panel is heterogenous or homogenous. To check this, this study applied the widely used Pesaran and Yamagata (2008)  technique in Table 3  . Notably, the delta statistics are 14.148 and 13.459 for models 1 and 2, respectively. The respective p-values for delta statistics are zero in both models representing that both statistics are significant. Likewise, the p-values of adjusted delta statistics are also zero suggesting that the panel under consideration is not homogenous. Hence, it would be better to choose techniques that do not assume the homogeneity of slope in further analysis. Consequently, the research applied the CADF and CIPS approaches in Table 4  , and the upshots depicted that LCF, GEN, HUC, EG, GR and PDT are nonstationary in CADF test. Nevertheless, the first difference transformation made the variables stationary. CIPS’ conclusions are also quite similar indicating that LCF, GR, GEN, EG, HUC, and PDT are stationary only at I(1). After this, the cointegration in models 1 and 2 should be estimated before doing the long-run analysis. In this context, the traditional Pedroni test was applied as this test is useful for a heterogeneous panel. Proceeding to the results in Table 5  , five (out of eight) within-dimension statistics are significant for model 1. Also, two (out of three) between-dimension statistics are significant. It implies that seven (out of eleven) tests are statistically significant, and thus, the majority of test statistics suggest cointegration in model 1. In model 2, six statistics are significant, and therefore, the majority of statistics demonstrate the cointegration in the models analyzed for the panel of ASEAN. The Pedroni test may not provide correct outcomes during CSD in datasets, and hence, the use of another cointegration test is necessary to report more robust findings. Considering this issues, the famous Durbin-Hausman-based method of Westerlund (2008)  is employed. The conclusions of this technique in Table 6   demonstrated that the group-based statistics for models 2 and 1 are statistically significant. This indicates cointegration between LCF, GR, GR2 , GEN, HUC, EG, and PDT. Also, the panel-based test further authorizes cointegration. This evidence is also checked in Table 7   by utilizing the Westerlund (2007)  procedure. The probability values of Ga and Pa are 0.997 and 0.989, respectively. It implies that these two statistics are insignificant. However, the probability values of 0.009 and 0.035 suggest the significance of Pt and Gt statistics, respectively. Thus, these two significant statistics indicate cointegration between LCF, GR, GR2 , GEN, HUC, PDT, and EG. The analysis conducted before fulfills the conditions to apply the CS-ARDL test, which is useful during CSD, residual correlation, endogeneity, and heterogeneity. The CS-ARDL also supports regressing the variables with different orders of integration. These significant advantages of CS-ARDL have made it a reliable estimator for the long-run estimation of heterogeneous panels. The long-run result of HUC in Table 8   illustrates that HUC stimulates LCF in the context of ASEAN. Interestingly, a significant increase of 1.189 % in LCF is the consequence of a 1 % upsurge in HUC. This finding demonstrates that HUC can expand LCF levels and thereby, boosts the quality of the environment. This fresh insight does not comply with the views of Zhou et al. (2022)  for Pakistan and Ahmed et al. (2021)  for Latin America and Caribbean countries since both these empirical studies depicted that HUC lessens environmental quality. However, the evidence from the empirical work of Pata and Isik (2021)  for China corresponds to our finding. There is insufficient literature on HUC and LCF; however, some studies that estimated the impacts of HUC on other environmental indicators also report that HUC expands environmental sustainability (Ahmed et al., 2020a; Lan et al., 2012; Pata and Caglar, 2021 ). As discussed earlier, education stimulates ecological awareness in society, which can enable businesses and individuals to adopt environmental conservation practices. Also, there is evidence relating the increased participation of people in recycling, adoption of green energy products, and other environmentally friendly activities linked with the improvement in education (Chankrajang and Muttarak, 2017; Desha et al., 2015; Zaidi et al., 2019; Zen et al., 2014 ). Thus, this reliable finding provides some new avenues for ASEAN to attain SDG 13 by promoting the impacts of HUC in the region and controlling the growing levels of environmental deterioration. The long-run impact of GEN is also not different than that of human capital. However, the magnitude of this impact is comparatively lower than that of HUC. An improvement of 0.40 % in LCF is achieved by increasing the green energy by 1 %. Thus, GEN also stimulates LCF in the region and expands the quality of the environment. This verdict is in consonance with those of Khan et al. (2022)  for E7 and G7, Akadiri et al. (2022)  for India, Shang et al. (2022)  for ASEAN, Liu et al. (2022)  for South Africa, and Dogan and Pata (2022)  for G7. However, some studies oppose this conclusion, for instance, Pata (2021b)  for Japan, Xu et al. (2022a)  for Brazil, and Pata and Kartal (2022)  for South Korea. The energy transition is the ultimate way to reduce the utilization of fossil fuels, and it requires boosting GEN in the total energy mix. Unlike conventional energy, green energy does not expand emissions levels. In addition, it helps to cut down the pollutant fossil fuels by adopting cleaner sources of energy. Thus, the energy policies of ASEAN are helpful in boosting LCF, and ASEAN should continue to augment the proportion of GEN in the energy mix. This policy will support these nations to progress in terms of SDG 7 and curb environmental deterioration. Proceeding to the load capacity curve, the significant negative (positive) coefficient of GR (GR2 ) postulates the validity of the LCC in ASEAN. The findings suggest that the LCF expands due to a rise in income at a considerably high level of growth while at low levels of growth, the LCF reduces due to high consumption of fossil fuels and weak ecological laws. LCF decreased by 0.404 % due to a 1 % rise in GR whereas a 1 % growth in GR2  boosts LCF by 0.004 %. This finding of a U-shaped load capacity curve contradicts those who believe in a linear connection between GR and LCF, for example, Pata and Isik (2021)  for China, Khan et al. (2022)  for E7 and G7, Liu et al. (2022)  for South Africa, and Adebayo et al. (2022)  for Thailand. However, the recent studies of Dogan and Pata (2022)  for G7 and Pata and Kartal (2022)  for South Korea support the LCC hypothesis. The justification of the LCC hypothesis comes from the theory of the famous EKC, which links deterioration in environmental quality with the scale effect at initial levels of growth. However, highly developed societies possess more environmental consciousness, and thus, environment-friendly laws and technologies, green energy usage, and higher energy efficiency curb the spread of pollution at a high development level (Uddin et al., 2016 ). This evidence along with the favorable impacts of HUC and green energy strategies advocate that development in terms of HUC and GEN will be helpful in realizing the LCC between GR and LCF. HUC and GEN pose similar effects on LCF in the short-run as well. However, the LCC does not exist in the short-run because the coefficient of GR2  is insignificant. In addition, PDT decreases LCF demonstrating that ASEAN nations are unable to control the environmental deterioration due to the expansion in population density. As a matter of fact, environmental problems move in tandem with the rise in PDT since pressure on resources expands due to growing demand from urban residents. Thus, transportation, construction, and industrialization activities expand due to increased PDT leading to a decrease in environmental quality. This impact of PDT corresponds to the outcome of Rasool et al. (2019) . Also, the coefficient of error correction term (-0.763) illustrates a high rate of convergence from the short-run path to the long-run. The analysis for robustness check by using model 2 is presented in Table 9  . The variable EG (economic globalization) is added to the model and the impacts of regressors on LCF are observed to know about the stability of the coefficients after the addition of another variable. The long-run findings remained consistent even after the addition of EG. Only some slight variations in the short-run were found. The signs of variables persisted during this analysis, which shows that the findings described in the previous Table are robust. EG decreases LCF and reduces the quality of the environment. There are no empirical works regarding the effects of EG on LCF; however, Awosusi et al. (2022)  used the overall globalization for South Africa and they found that globalization increases LCF. Thus, their finding opposes the result of this study. Nevertheless, Akadiri et al. (2022)  support this finding by using financial globalization, which only includes the financial components of economic globalization, such as portfolio investment and FDI. Reduction in LCF due to a rise in EG is understandable because EG stimulates international trade, which significantly decreases environmental quality due to the scale effect (Shahbaz et al., 2018b ). Also, FDI is well known to exert the pollution haven effect in the developing world. Thus, a negative linkage between LCF and EG holds in the ASEAN (Shahbaz et al., 2018a ). Also, the CS-ARDL long-run outcomes are given in Fig. 6  . In Table 10 , FMOLS is applied as an alternative method to verify the long-run coefficients. The signs and significance of the coefficients did not change when FMOLS is applied. LGR has significant negative coefficients in models 1 and 2. Similar to previous findings, the coefficients of GR2  are positive in Table 10  . Once again, this outcome has validated the LCC hypothesis since higher levels of GR enhance LCF and lower levels of GR reduce LCF. HUC and GEN intensify LCF which infers that the environmental quality of the ASEAN improves on account of a rise in HUC and green energy. PDT reduces LCF and adversely impacts environmental quality. Similarly, EG has a negative linkage with LCF signifying that economic globalization enhances the environmental problems in ASEAN. After validating the results, the causal analysis is performed. From the outcomes of the causal analysis in Table 11  , it is established that HUC Granger causes LCF. Similarly, the causality flows from GR and EG to LCF. This complements the earlier long-run findings, and thus, changes in these three variables will influence LCF. The indication of the feedback effect between GEN and LCF suggests that on the one hand, the causality flows from GEN to LCF since increasing the GEN will improve the environment. On the other hand, decreases in the LCF will urge governments to adopt green energy for boosting the LCF levels. Thus, this linkage causes a feedback effect. Likewise, a similar feedback effect holds in the case of population density and LCF.  5 Conclusion and policies The advanced econometric analysis with the intention to reveal the effects of HUC and green energy on LCF and analyze the existence of a load capacity curve in ASEAN provided that the LCF and selected variables are cointegrated. The empirical analysis disclosed the LCC in the region. This implies that the current economic growth reduces the load capacity factor. However, if the ASEAN could achieve a higher level of growth, the LCF will be expanded and the quality of the environment will be improved. The analysis also revealed mitigating impacts of HUC and green energy on LCF. In addition, population density and economic globalization reduce the LCF. Besides, HUC and economic globalization Granger cause LCF, while a two-way causal association between LCF and green energy exists in the region. These findings provide important insights for effective climate control policies. First, the focus should be on boosting the levels of green energy since it is conducive to environmental quality. This target (SDG 7) requires policies leading to the imposition of carbon taxes and other high taxes to reduce their demand. At the same time, efforts are needed to offer green energy sources at cheap and affordable prices to avoid a possible decline in growth. The second part of this strategy also requires higher energy research-related investments to boost innovation in green energy as well as certain subsidies on green energy to develop its market. Human capital can also be very important to support green energy adoption and climate control. As HUC is a combination of education and its returns, necessary steps are required to improve the quality of education and synchronize the current education syllabus with environmental awareness. Another aspect of the HUC strategy involves providing training for resource-saving in the industries. Initiating certain resource conservation campaigns using modern social media platforms can also boost the awareness level. This strategy is expected to boost the demand for green energy sources and also increase resource conservation practices. Population density poses a serious environmental risk in the region that requires population management and city management policies along with effective green transportation policies. Besides, economic globalization lessens LCF in the selected sample. To address this, trade and FDI can be effectively regulated to avoid the possible pollution haven effects. There should be easier investment opportunities in efficient and environmentally friendly technologies. However, investment in outdated dirty technologies should be strictly regulated and environmental laws should be tightened in the whole region. These policies if implemented successfully can help to increase LCF and accomplish environmental targets and SDGs. This research provides useful findings and policies regarding HUC and green energy for ASEAN and other developing nations. However, the focus of the study is on overall green energy. In this regard, future studies can tend to focus on different types of green energy sources to understand the impact of each energy source on LCF. Besides, this study used a national-level panel dataset, which can only indicate the overall policy framework and regional results. Empirical analysis by using the data from provinces and cities can be useful for more specific policies to expand the LCF. Besides, in methodology, future studies may employ quantile regression to understand the roles of HUC and green energy in LCF at different quantiles.
