                  Recently, the academic and scientific debate has been strongly focused on the use of digital technologies to address sustainability issues. In particular, the use of digital technologies could be the key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) declared in the 2030 Agenda. Although several studies have focused on the combination of digital technologies and SDGs, current research has less analyzed them considering specific business functions and processes. Hence, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the triple link “digital technologies - business functions and processes - SDGs” in production systems. The article proposes a mixed approach based on an extensive literature review and the application of the association rules technique. Specifically, the study collected 2496 sustainable business practices supported by 11 digital technologies within 42 business processes for the achievement of the 17 SDGs. Then, this paper employed the Apriori algorithm to intercept the main combinations between digital technologies, business processes, and SDGs. The results suggest that artificial intelligence, geospatial technologies, blockchain, Internet of Things, and 3D printing can contribute to the achievement of SDGs 6,7, 12, and 13 in different business processes. The study provides several implications for managers and policymakers to direct their business strategy and technological choices in the adoption of digital technologies geared toward achieving the SDGs.

Editor: Dr. Sachin K. Mangla Recently, the academic and scientific debate has been strongly focused on the use of digital technologies to address sustainability issues. In particular, the use of digital technologies could be the key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) declared in the 2030 Agenda. Although several studies have focused on the combination of digital technologies and SDGs, current research has less analyzed them considering specific business functions and processes. Hence, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the triple link “digital technologies - business functions and processes - SDGs” in production systems. The article proposes a mixed approach based on an extensive literature review and the application of the association rules technique. Specifically, the study collected 2496 sustainable business practices supported by 11 digital technologies within 42 business processes for the achievement of the 17 SDGs. Then, this paper employed the Apriori algorithm to intercept the main combinations between digital technologies, business processes, and SDGs. The results suggest that artificial intelligence, geospatial technologies, blockchain, Internet of Things, and 3D printing can contribute to the achievement of SDGs 6,7, 12, and 13 in different business processes. The study provides several implications for managers and policymakers to direct their business strategy and technological choices in the adoption of digital technologies geared toward achieving the SDGs.   Keywords SDG  Production systems  Blockchain  Artificial intelligence  Association rules   Data availability Data is available in the paper itself.   1 Introduction Current issues related to globalization, increased competitiveness, more efficient process management, faster and automated delivery times and sustainable development are pushing ‘traditional’ companies toward new technological and business challenges (Simmert et al., 2019 ). In this context, production systems are undergoing a huge digital transformation that facilitates and improves the management of business activities by reducing costs and improving quality (Ghobakhloo, 2020 ; Wang et al., 2016 ). Moreover, the technological choices that organizations face are increasingly influenced by the need to improve sustainable development within their business functions and processes (Formentini and Taticchi, 2016 ; Sharma et al., 2023 ). Specifically, the SDGs, outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda, are not optional but fundamental for the survival of both organizations and society. In this context, to achieve the SDGs, companies are increasingly up-to-date in using new digital technologies for sustainability issues (Mora-Contreras et al., 2023 ). The scientific literature is rich in contributions to the convergence of digitalization and sustainability. For example, De Man and Strandhagen (2017)  discuss the implications of digital technologies within sustainable business models. Numerous studies investigate how individual digital technologies can improve different aspects of sustainability (i.e. environmental, social, and economic aspects) (Chen et al., 2023 ; Rejeb et al., 2023 ; Wilson et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the literature is increasingly pushing toward the links between digital technologies and the circular economy, providing innovative insights into the use of specific technologies over others (Rosa et al., 2020 ; Schöggl et al., 2023 ). In recent years, several authors have tried to associate the use of digital technologies with the achievement of the SDGs by providing different perspectives (Ghobakhloo et al., 2022 ). For example, some studies have investigated how individual technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, robotics, and 3D printing can help organizations achieve the SDGs (Chandan et al., 2023 ; Di Vaio et al., 2020 ; Giordano et al., 2023 ; Hai Alami et al., 2024 ). Other authors have assessed the importance of digital technologies for sustainability purposes by investigating specific research areas such as agri-food, manufacturing, and supply chain (Hassoun et al., 2022 ; Kluczek et al., 2023 ). However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no studies that have analyzed which business functions and business processes digital technologies are used within production systems to achieve the 17 SDGs. Since the introduction of the SDGs in 2015, one of the critical issues found in the literature is the lack of clarity and inconsistency in defining which business functions and processes new digital technologies can be applied to align them with sustainable goals (Lashitew, 2021 ). These gaps were clearly outlined in the study by Sarkis and Ibrahim (2022) , highlighting the need to investigate the effect of digital technologies on the business functions and processes of production systems and operations management to achieve specific SDGs. Therefore, the research question aimed at bridging this gap is: “What are the key digital technologies adopted within specific business functions and processes in production systems to achieve the SDGs? ” To properly address the research question, the study proposes a mixed methodology combining a literature review (LR) and association rules technique. Specifically, the study relies on the analysis of 661 articles based on case studies, simulations, pilot projects, and mathematical models from 2019 to 2023, intercepting 2496 sustainable business practices (SBPs) where digital technologies have been implemented to achieve SGDs. This led to the dataset construction consisting of the following elements a) digital technologies, b) business functions and processes, and c) SDGs. Then, the association rule technique was applied to intercept the main relationships between the adoption of 11 digital technologies in 42 business processes and the achievement of the 17 SDGs. From over 7000 potential combinations, this technique identified the 13 most robust and useful patterns linking digital technology, business processes, and SDGs. The study contributes to providing a clear representation of the use of digital technologies for the achievement of the SDGs in specific business functions and processes to appropriately address the technological business strategies and ensure more informed decisions for managers and policymakers. The article is structured as follows: Section 2  provides a theoretical background on the elements considered for the construction of the dataset, i.e. digital technologies, business functions and processes in production systems, and the SDGs. Moreover, a further section clarifies current research gaps and defines the objective of the study. Section 3  describes the methodology used; Section 4  provides the main results; while Section 5  discusses the contribution of the research findings and develops a future research agenda. The conclusions close the work.  2 Theoretical Background 2.1 Digital Technologies In literature, there is no specific classification of current digital technologies. The classifications among different studies are conflicting, and there are several inconsistencies among various authors. An initial classification of digital technologies was provided by the Boston Consulting Group in 2015, which included nine Industry 4.0 technologies such as robots and autonomous vehicles, additive manufacturing, augmented and virtual reality, big data, simulation, Internet of Things (IoT), horizontal and vertical systems, cloud technologies, blockchain, and cybersecurity (Rüßmann et al., 2015 ). Over the years, they have been grouped into digital and physical technologies. The former include drones, additive manufacturing, robotics, and sensors (Liao et al., 2017 ). The latter embraces cloud computing, AI, big data, blockchain, and simulation (Olsen and Tomlin, 2020 ). Similarly, ElFar et al. (2021)  classified technologies into two groups: operational and IT and digital. However, the current literature lacks consensus on which technologies carefully describe the current state of Industry 4.0 because digital transformation is evolving rapidly. To date, there are several literature reviews and conceptual articles that attempt to categorize them (Ivanov et al., 2019 ). For example, the study conducted by Queiroz et al. (2021)  identifies a portfolio of six digital technologies such as AI, big data, blockchain, cloud systems, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and IoT to analyze their capabilities in digital supply chains. From this classification, Gebhardt et al. (2022)  added other two technologies, i.e. additive manufacturing and digital twins, to study the collaboration in circular supply chains. Other scholars such as Bai et al. (2023)  evaluate the adoption of sixteen digital technologies to promote social sustainability for the circular economy. They are grouped into 3D printing, AI, big data and analytics, autonomous robots, blockchain, cloud computing, robotics, cybersecurity, RFID, unmanned aerial vehicle, industrial IoT, GPS, nanotechnology, mobile technology, sensors and actuators, and simulation. Dantas et al. (2021)  classified Industry 4.0 technologies into big data, CPS, additive manufacturing, IoT, Internet of Services, cloud computing, systems integration, augmented reality, autonomous robots, and cybersecurity. The study conducted by Zheng et al. (2021)  provides a further classification of technologies based on a critical review of previous research recognized in the literature. They identify 10 clusters of technologies for manufacturing industries such as CPS, IoT, cloud technology, blockchain, big data and analytics, AI, simulation and modeling, automation and industrial robotics, visualization technology, and additive manufacturing. Changing perspective with Industry 5.0 principles, the European Commission identified six main technologies. Many Industry 4.0 technologies are included in this new paradigm; however, these technologies focus on energy efficiency, storage, and the biological sphere. In particular, they are grouped into six categories: digital twins and simulation, AI, storage and analysis technologies, data transmission, bio-inspired technologies and smart materials and autonomy technologies, and, finally, individualized human-machine interaction (European Commission et al., 2021 ). Other researchers such as Maddikunta et al. (2022)  extended the categorization to sixteen technology clusters by adding 5 g/6 g technology, virtual, augmented, extended and mixed reality, and cobots. This study will follow the classification approach of Cammarano et al. (2023)  because it is more up-to-date and inclusive of the digital technologies present in the current scenario. Table 1   presents the digital technologies considered with a brief description.  2.2 Business Functions and Processes for Production Systems The literature presents several reference models in which different business functions and processes are listed. The most recent are the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model and the Process Classification Framework (PCF). The first model includes five main processes: planning, procurement, production, delivery, and return. It identifies best practices to be adopted in supply chain management (Stewart, 1997 ). The second includes twelve business processes classified into operational and supporting processes (Acín et al., 2018 ). The latter can be considered an extension of Porter's (2011) model, in which activities are classified into primary - operations, inbound and outbound logistics, service, marketing, and sales - and supporting primary activities - technological development, infrastructure, procurement, and human resource management. Another model is the Value Reference Model (VRM) (Kirikova et al., 2012 ). It classifies business functions into three levels: governance, planning, and execution. The first is concerned with strategic processes, the second with tactical processes, and the last with operational processes. Recent literature has considered further classifications of business functions. For example, Bai et al. (2022)  identified eight different supply chain processes related to the concept of the circular economy, such as sourcing, product design, manufacturing, remanufacturing, logistics, reverse logistics, product use, and pre-processing. In addition, Zheng et al. (2021)  considered eleven business functions in the manufacturing sector: supply chain configuration, new product development, internal logistics management, integrated supply chain planning, production scheduling and control, maintenance, quality, energy, customer relationship and after-sales management. From these models, the list of business functions considered is shown in Table 2  .  2.3 SDGs In the last decades, interest in the SDGs has shaken the scientific and industrial community. They focus on elements of sustainable development concerning human beings and economic, social, and environmental challenges (Sonetti et al., 2019 ). These elements are highly interconnected and harmonized to ensure the well-being of society (Di Vaio et al., 2020 ). They include 17 goals and 169 targets to be achieved by 2030. They have several strengths because they facilitate business engagement in sustainable development by providing a greater understanding of the social and environmental issues that commonly plague companies passively (Lashitew, 2021 ). In addition, the SDGs support companies' communications about their social and environmental performance in a language understood by both media and governments. For example, the study by Vann Yaroson et al. (2024)  highlights the importance of improving business performance through circular economy strategies aimed at achieving specific SDGs. In the past, the main sustainability model was the triple-bottom-line (3BL) based on the book ‘Cannibals With Forks ’ (Elkington, 1997 ). It classified sustainability into three pillars: economic, environmental, and social. The advent of the SDGs has further developed, deepened, and detailed the sustainability dimensions by considering several aspects. To facilitate the study of the SDGs and provide more coherent interpretations, several scholars have tried grouping the SDGs according to different perspectives. For example, according to Cataldo et al. (2021) , SDGs 13–17 refer to environmental dimensions including water quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste management; SDGs 1–6 represent social dimensions such as poverty reduction and inequality; and finally, SDGs 7–12 represent mainly economic indicators. The Overseas Development Institute has grouped the SDGs according to the reform, revolution, and reversal dimensions (Nicolai et al., 2015 ). SDGs 1, 8, and 5 are the reform ones. They aim to eradicate poverty, reduce deforestation, and support economic growth in developing countries. SDGs 2–7, 9, 16, and 17 are grouped under the ‘revolution’ category, where the required activities are based on high technological and social progress. While SDGs 10–14 refer to the reversal group, they require activities that counter existing trends. Sachs et al. (2019)  classified the SDGs into six vital transformations for business strategies such as education, health and wellness, circular economy and zero carbon emissions, sustainable food resource management, sustainable cities and communities, and digital societies. Moreover, Bai et al. (2020)  grouped SDGs 1, 8, 9, 11, and 17 into economic sustainability. SDGs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 16 are included in the social dimension, while SDGs 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are aligned with environmental sustainability. A further categorization by Cai and Choi (2020)  groups SDGs 1–5, 11, 16, and 17 into social sustainability, SDGs 8, 9, 10, 12, and 17 into the economic dimension, and, finally, SDGs 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 and 17 into the environmental dimension. In this study, to facilitate the analysis of the results, we will follow the approach of Dantas et al. (2021) , which organizes the SDGs more rigorously and comprehensively. Specifically, the SDGs are grouped into three areas “Biosphere” (SDGs 6, 13, 14 15), “Society” (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 16), and “Economy” (SDGs 8, 9, 10, 12, 17).  2.4 Research Gaps and Aim of the Study Over the past five years, the convergence of digitalization and sustainability issues has grown exponentially. Many authors have engaged in different analyses providing different perspectives on the intersection between digital transformation and the SDGs. Table 3   compares different research articles reporting on the different topics where scholars have focused their attention. In particular, the topics of digital technologies, business functions and processes, and the SDGs are shown. Table 3  discerns articles that individually investigated the single technology, or business function and process, or one SDG from those that offer a broader overview of the various elements. In addition, the research area investigated, and the research methodology adopted in the study are reported. Many research efforts are being directed at jointly analyzing the use of multiple digital technologies to achieve different SDGs. This is done using different research methodologies such as multi-criteria methods, bibliometric reviews, systematic literature reviews (SLRs), social network analysis, and theoretical articles. For instance, there are scientific articles that focus on the analysis of individual technologies for the achievement of different SDGs. An example is the study by Chandan et al. (2023)  that has analyzed how blockchain could be used to achieve different SDGs in the agri-food sector. A further perspective of analysis is based on the study of specific research areas such as agri-food, manufacturing, supply chain, and production systems. It is evident that several articles do not focus on the specific research area, however, some authors consider it important because there are specific issues, challenges, opportunities, and conditions in managing business activities. Table 3  highlights that there is a lack of studies that comprehensively investigate the triple linkage of the various digital technologies the different business functions and processes and the 17 SDGs. For example, the study by Aravindaraj and Rajan Chinna (2022)  focuses strictly on the analysis of digital technologies for the achievement of several SDGs for warehouse management. Other studies investigate the use of digital technologies in business functions and processes in the manufacturing industry while ignoring or neglecting the SDGs (Srhir et al., 2023 ). From this list of studies, the scientific articles that considered all the three elements under analysis are the study by Bai et al. (2022)  and Srhir et al. (2023) . However, the first study focuses on the electronics industry to explore the impact of digital technologies, limited to the analysis of the social sustainability dimension. Furthermore, it is based on the opinion of industry experts applying the DEMATEL methodology. The second article investigates the convergence of digital technologies, business functions and processes, and SDGs by providing a theoretical framework based on the SCOR model. Therefore, this contribution does not provide experimental results based on the statistical evidence. Therefore, the main contribution of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of 11 digital technologies to achieve 17 SDGs within 42 business processes. Moreover, apart from the study by Pansare et al. (2023)  who employed a bibliometric analysis of 1190 articles on the link between digital technologies and SDGs in the manufacturing industry, this article analyzed the highest number of articles. Furthermore, the novelty and originality of the study was the application of the Apriori algorithm to identify the most stable patterns of technology-business process-SDG combination providing clear managerial and policymaker implications regarding the adoption of specific digital technologies.   3 Methodology The objective of the article is to investigate the relationship between digital technologies and the SDGs in specific business functions and processes of production systems. Fig. 1   summarizes the methodology used. It is based on a mixed approach combining an LR and the application of the association rules technique. The first step consists of extracting, identifying, and collecting SBPs through an LR. It is a replicable and transparent method to collect data in a standardized and comparable manner (Kitchenham and Charters, 2007 ; Tranfield et al., 2003 ). The study aims to identify SBPs in which it clearly explains how digital technologies have been employed within business functions and business processes of specific case studies, simulations, pilot projects, and mathematical models to achieve the SDGs. An SBP is defined as a new way of conducting a specific activity using digital technologies to achieve sustainability goals. Each SBP was classified according to the a) digital technologies, b) business functions and processes, and c) the SDGs following the study of Perano et al. (2023) . This requires a time-consuming effort for manual content analysis of each article. After building the dataset containing thousands of SBPs, the second step was to apply the Apriori algorithm, which is one of the machine learning techniques linked to association rules (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994 ). It identified the most robust combinations of digital technology and business processes that have the highest probability of achieving a specific SDG. The following sections will provide detailed insights into how the methodology was conducted. 3.1 Search Criteria and Screening Phases Fig. 2   shows a schematization of the search criteria, screening phase, and article classification. The research database is SCOPUS because it is a multidisciplinary database and encloses IEEE, Taylor and Francis, Elsevier, Springer, Wiley SAGE, and Emerald journals. The choice to use SCOPUS is threefold. First, it improves the replicability, rigor, and clarity of research results (Paré et al., 2015 ). Second, it is a large and multidisciplinary database in which articles from both scientific and humanities disciplines are included (Bramer et al., 2016 ; Festa et al., 2018 ). Third, it allows the selection of the subject area of the relevant articles. The subject areas considered are accounting, engineering, computer science, finance, economics, management, and operations research in the Q1 and Q2 quartiles according to ISI Web of Science and Scimago Journal Ranking. In this way, articles referring to the top journals were identified. The review process is based on the manual reading of peer-reviewed articles by a team of industrial engineers. For this research, conference articles, PhD theses, book chapters, and industrial reports were not considered to ensure greater comparability, standardization, and reproducibility of data collection. Articles written in English and published between 2019 and 2023 were evaluated. The reason for choosing this time horizon is based on the need to investigate current digital technologies. Using the “advanced search” section of SCOPUS, the set of keywords searched in the Title or Keywords is related to the technologies reported in Table 1 . An example of the search string used for the digital technology ‘computing’ is given below: TITLE (“cloud computing”) OR KEY (“cloud computing “) OR TITLE (“cloud storage”) OR KEY (“cloud storage”) OR TITLE (“fog computing”) OR KEY (“fog computing”) OR TITLE (“edge computing”) OR KEY (“edge computing”) OR TITLE (“quantum computing”) OR KEY (“quantum computing”) OR TITLE (“cloudlet computing”) OR KEY (“cloudlet computing”). Appendix A shows the keywords used for the search string of each digital technology analyzed. This search string has already been applied to scientific articles published in international journals (Cammarano et al., 2023 ; Varriale et al., 2023a ). More than 70,000 articles were identified from this search string. From this list, a sample of 20,809 articles was searched, equally distributed among digital technologies. However, 1086 articles were not downloadable. Therefore, the analyzed papers were 19,723.  3.2 Article Selection Criteria In this step, the team conducted a manual content analysis of papers to identify SBPs supported by digital technologies. They read scientific articles and identified those that clearly defined how digital technologies support SDG-oriented business practices. Each classification carried out by a team member was verified by the others to validate the results. The analysis was performed without the support of automatic or semi-automatic text analysis tools. This requires a time-consuming effort for manual content analysis of each article. The selected papers were simulations, business case studies, and pilot projects in which digital technologies were used to achieve SDGs. For the purposes of this research, there are 661 eligible articles. The selected articles contain all the information needed to identify SBPs, i.e. which digital technologies are used, in which business functions and processes, and for which SDGs. However, a high number of scientific articles that were not eligible for this research were excluded at this stage. In particular, literature reviews, theoretical and conceptual articles, articles based on surveys and interviews, articles discussing technical issues, articles referring to the public sector, and articles in which at least one of the elements of analysis has not been clarified or empirically proven (i.e. digital technology, business functions and processes, and SDGs) were excluded.  3.3 Article Classification The selected articles contain at least one SBP aimed at achieving specific SDGs. The SBP is classified according to the simultaneous presence of the following variables: a) digital technology, b) business functions and processes in which the technology is used, and c) SDGs achieved. The classification of articles into the above three elements is based on previous classifications already recognized in the scientific literature (Cammarano et al., 2023 ; Perano et al., 2023 ). Fig. 3   shows an example of data collection. In this case, the objective of the article was to analyze the improvement of logistics operations management with AI and to measure the well-being and safety of workers (Aloini et al., 2022 ). The combination of these three variables is counted and evaluated as an SBP. In this study, the number of SBPs oriented toward achieving SDGs is 2496.   4 Results Table 4   shows the distribution of eligible papers identified per year, while Table 5   presents the distribution of the most recurring scientific journals in which at least 10 articles were intercepted and classified. For this research, 119 different international scientific journals were intercepted. Table 6   shows the count of SBPs for each digital technology considered. The highest number of SBPs are related to AI, geospatial tech, and blockchain. At the bottom, there are immersive environments, 3D printing, and computing. Fig. 4   presents the business processes grouped by business functions in which SBPs were identified. Most of the SBPs intercepted are related to the primary functions of production systems such as ‘operations’, ‘distribution’, and ‘procurement’. In literature, digital technologies are less studied to improve the support areas of production systems such as ‘R&D', ‘A&F', and ‘HR’. Table 7   shows the count of SBPs identified per SDG achieved. For production systems, the SDG most explored is 12, followed by 13 and 7 whereas the least explored ones are 1, 4, and 5. The following sections show the results on the links between digital technologies, business functions and processes, and the achievement of SDGs. Specifically, only those SDGs for which there are more than ten SBPs for the specific business process considered and at least five SBPs related to each digital technology identified are shown. Therefore, SDGs 1, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, 16 and 17 were excluded from the analysis. 4.1 Society Table 8   summarizes SBPs related to the SDGs of the ‘society’ dimension using digital technologies for applications in specific business functions and processes. SDG 2  aims to reduce food waste and loss. The elimination of hunger can be reached by improving nutrition, increasing food security, and promoting sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the use of digital technologies to improve food preservation is crucial. For example, machine learning techniques can predict the incidence of crop diseases by considering factors such as humidity and temperature. Knowledge of these key indicators can reduce the rate of plant diseases. Georeferenced data can provide key information such as soil quality and how fertilizer use affects yield to increase productivity and have a more effective agricultural policy. Another helpful technology to support this goal is the IoT. It can be used to monitor water, air, and soil and provide benefits in terms of improving the efficiency, quality, and sustainability of harvested products. For the ‘society’ dimension, SDG 3  is aimed at promoting research on health issues and improving human well-being, focusing on technological innovation for the enhancement of preventive health tools. The goal focuses on how to reduce mortality, eradicate epidemics, fight diseases, and prevent accidents. Different technologies can support several of these open issues. For example, devices with IoT sensors can monitor the health status and movement of workers (e.g. temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure) and provide medical assistance quickly in real-time. For maintenance and diagnostics, drones can quickly detect faults on power lines and prevent any risk to workers' health and the environment. Finally, SDG 7  aims to guarantee universal access to reliable, affordable, sustainable, and advanced energy services. It promotes both increased use of renewable energy to substitute fossil fuels and increased energy efficiency. To achieve these objectives, different technologies can be adopted in different business functions and processes. For example, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can identify suitable sites for the installation of renewable energy plants to improve the energy efficiency of production systems. For the production of goods, the use of 3D printing reduces the energy impact as the material can be reused in subsequent prints, saving time, costs, and energy consumption. Furthermore, the use of automated vehicles for the transportation of workers and goods can improve energy efficiency by reducing carbon emissions due to the personal behavior of drivers.  4.2 Biosphere As to the ‘biosphere’ dimension, access to clean water and sanitation is a determining factor in all aspects of social, economic, and environmental development. The management of the entire water cycle needs to be more efficient, through investments in the different activities from extraction to distribution and wastewater treatment. In the current landscape, several digital technologies can help to improve SDG 6  (Table 9  ). For example, satellites can measure the degree of drought in water basins with high efficiency compared to traditional methods, as they can monitor huge areas. This enables optimal water management for optimized agriculture. For operations control, specific AI algorithms can determine the level of water pollution with high accuracy and recommend potential solutions. There are open-source technologies that can track plastic pollution in water systems that facilitate the location of plastic accumulation areas. Crowdsourcing supported by web and mobile platforms could be used for rainfall monitoring to assess water availability for food and energy crops. IoT could monitor water use in the food and manufacturing sectors. Through the combination of sensors, WiFi technology, Bluetooth, and web applications, various information can be captured, so that improvements can be identified to optimize water resource efficiency. The use of mobile applications and cloud-based web platforms can provide water operators with effective operations management methods, such as automatic billing, for greater trust and transparency among customers. This leads to water savings and higher water supply fees. Finally, geospatial technologies, such as satellite remote sensing, can measure water quality by considering the toxic elements dissolved in it. SDG 13  aims to take protective actions to tackle climate change. For example, by using blockchain and smart contracts, it is possible to automate order management to design distribution routes to achieve lower carbon emissions and pollution. For delivery and transportation, crowdsourcing initiatives are emerging to contribute to sustainability and a cleaner world economy. Specifically, it is an emerging trend in freight transportation that facilitates the linkage between supply and demand by connecting people who offer to transport packages to specific individuals. Moreover, drones could become a disruptive technology in last-mile deliveries. Their use could lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the freight transportation sector. The combination of autonomous robots and drones, instead of traditional delivery vehicles, could optimize the energy consumed and reduce carbon emissions. From a strategic planning perspective, GIS could support transport planning by considering faster routes for the delivery of perishable products to reduce the carbon footprint and fuel consumption. The combination of AI techniques with autonomous vehicles can help to reduce carbon emissions through optimized routing and efficient management of energy consumption. Finally, blockchain can manage firm relationships on a single shared platform that reduces carbon emissions instead of traditional paper-based exchanges. SDG 15  aims to protect, renovate, and foster the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, reduce desertification, reverse land degradation, sustainably manage forests, and stop biodiversity loss. Geospatial technologies are the key technologies to achieve this goal. GIS systems can identify suitable locations for the construction of agricultural sites by considering parameters such as topographical features, soil features, and identification of dry land. By combining remote sensing images and rainfall data, it is possible to evaluate the stability of farmed land for semi-arid areas. Therefore, remote sensing has enormous potential for providing monitoring and assessment of ecosystems to stop biodiversity loss.  4.3 Economy Finally, as to the ‘economy’ dimension, SDG 8  aims at economic growth and the creation of decent work. It promotes full employment for all human beings. In support of this goal, blockchain can monitor and track companies in conditions of human rights violations, child labor, inhuman working environments, slavery in developing countries, corruption, and extortion (Table 10  ). Blockchain combined with IoT enables the data recording to trace the origin of products and to establish that the actions of supply chain participants comply with sustainability guidelines and standards. Therefore, non-compliance practices are avoided because everything is tracked, and the technology ensures the security of transactions. SDG 9  aims to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, build resilient infrastructure, and support innovation. Recently, robotics and 3D printing are technologies that can support these activities. For instance, connected autonomous vehicles can enable more sustainable and efficient freight transportation practices. In particular, vehicles within communication range can make driving easier, reducing distance and fuel consumption. The use of drones supports faster last-mile deliveries at a lower cost. 3D printing promotes sustainable industrialization and innovation as specific components and products can be produced with energy efficiency and sustainable materials. SDG 12  promotes the adoption of an environmental approach. The volume of waste is to be significantly reduced through recovery, reuse, and recycling. Furthermore, companies are to be encouraged to embrace sustainable business management. Different digital technologies can be used to achieve this goal in various business functions and processes. For example, perishable products connected in an IoT environment, where inventories are visible in real-time, can be shipped to the customer with the earliest expiry date to minimize overall waste. Often these systems can be combined with machine learning techniques to optimize reorder levels by considering elements such as the maintenance cost, the frequency of inventory sharing, and the overall waste ratio. For reverse logistics, the use of GPS and IoT supports the development of optimization strategies to improve recycling by collecting and analyzing data on user behavior. GIS can take into account the lifecycle emissions of raw materials by reducing their consumption and associated costs. They support the location choices of facilities such as waste, recycling, and disposal centres. In addition, hazardous waste management can be carried out via IoT infrastructure, Bluetooth, RFID tags, and blockchain. Through these technologies, various information can be collected to track and update specific product states such as geolocation, weight, temperature, reuse, remanufacturing, recycling, or disposal. This enables supply chain actors to plan the receipt, shipment, and treatment of hazardous waste to reduce costs and increase the capacity for material recovery and reuse. Digital applications can more easily promote consumers' environmental awareness and educate more users on return policies. Opinion mining on social media can assist manufacturers of restored products in developing suitable strategies for the product remanufacturing cycle. Regarding operations control, IoT, digital twin, and predictive tools can monitor waste in different business processes and share it through cloud platforms to achieve better resource efficiency, reduce disposal costs, and increase competitive advantages related to traceability. The combination of the digital twin with blockchain technology can provide product history and record it during after-sales, identify bottlenecks in recycling programs, and improve supply chain efficiency. 3D printing is increasingly helpful for the production of goods as it uses recycled plastic material to carry out high-quality components while reducing the need for raw materials. Machine learning algorithms applied to social media can analyze data on the production and packaging of products according to improved sustainability. Regarding procurement activities, blockchain, RFID, wireless sensors, and QR codes can support buyer-supplier relationships, order management, and supplier evaluation and selection. RFID tags can track the information of each item during its life cycle, blockchain creates a secure database, and smart contracts can help the supplier selection process by consulting and comparing results in the distributed ledger. The use of smart contracts promotes significant responsiveness in order management and buyer-supplier relations so that suppliers cannot violate the contract.  4.4 Association Rule – Apriori Algorithm The results obtained were further analyzed by exploiting the association rules mining techniques, i.e. the Apriori algorithm (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994 ). It enables the identification of the most robust combinations of digital technology and business processes that have the highest probability of achieving the SDGs. Starting from the dataset of 2496 SBPs, the association rules predict the probability of finding the remaining Y elements from a subset of X elements. The logical expression is as follows: {X} → {Y}. Specifically, the set {X} is the antecedent and corresponds to an element found within the dataset, whereas the set {Y} is the consequent. The latter identifies the element that is in combination with the antecedent. Based on these associations, two indicators are provided: the support (#s ) and confidence (c ) values. The support (#s ) is the frequency of occurrence of each antecedent. While the support value (s ) is the ratio of #s  to overall SBPs. The confidence value (c ) indicates how often the association rule between antecedent and consequent is true. Finally, the product Support * Confidence (s*c ) identifies the most frequent rules relevant to each antecedent (Çakır et al., 2021 ; Nahar et al., 2013 ). For this research, the antecedent is the technology-business process pair, while the consequent is the SDG: {digital technology, business process} - > {SDG}. In this case, the presence of digital technology within a specific business process is linked to the occurrence of a specific SDG. The number of occurrences in which the combination {digital technology, business process, SDG} occurs in the database is #s , while the probability of finding {SDG} as a consequent when the antecedents are {technology, business process} is c . According to the results of the Apriori algorithm, the 13 rules shown in Table 11   represent the most relevant and interesting ones for the study. The analysis suggests which rules are most useful for the implementation of a specific digital technology within a business process to support the achievement of a specific SDG. To identify the most interesting associations, only those that meet minimum support and confidence thresholds are taken into account. Specifically, the support threshold (#s ) was set equal to 20, while the confidence threshold (c ) is 0.25. Importantly, the potential number of combinations {technology, business process} - > {SDG} is over 7000, so the methodology allows focusing on a few rules that are the most established and significant. Fig. 5   shows the position of each rule, where on the horizontal axis is the support level #s  and on the vertical axis, is confidence value c . Furthermore, the color of the bubbles depends on the SDG and their size on the parameter s*c . A label is added to clarify which antecedents {technology, business process} are linked to the rule. Both Table 11  and Fig. 5  show that the most interesting rules refer to four SDGs, six technologies, and eight processes. Goal 12 is the most recurring. Since all goals are mainly related to the environmental aspects of sustainability, this research confirms the attention of companies to environmental issues. The highest levels of s were discovered for the rule {AI, operations control} - > {SDG 7}. This means that this connection is particularly emphasized in the literature, with many case studies and simulations suggesting its implementation. Therefore, there is an established relationship between these elements. Furthermore, the highest value of confidence c  is linked to the rule {blockchain, supplier evaluation/selection} - > {SDG 12} with a value of 0.6512. This means that about 65 % of the SBPs that use blockchain for supplier evaluation and selection are in line with SDG 12. Thus, there is a focus on a specific SDG instead of dispersion across multiple goals, signaling the strength of the relationship. For instance, the integration of technologies such as smart contracts and blockchain can help logistics companies achieve a real-time exchange of information securely and transparently and choose the best sustainable supplier. The highest value of s*c  is reached by the rule {geospatial technology, strategic planning} - > {SDG 7}, which can be considered one of the most important relationships between technologies and SDGs. Further interesting insights emerge. For example, operations control activities are strongly linked to sustainability issues and the implementation of technologies within this process could particularly support the achievement of the SDGs. Depending on the technology implemented, i.e. IoT, geospatial tech, and AI, different SDGs are supported, respectively 12, 6, and 7. Moreover, while some relationships emerge with high levels of confidence, other peculiarities concern technologies that are linked to multiple SDGs. Some technologies are associated with two SDGs with an average confidence of about 30 %. This is the case of blockchain implementation for managing buyer-supplier relationships, which relates to both SDGs 12 and 13, as well as AI in production planning activities, which can support the achievement of both SDGs 7 and 12. Important relationships emerge between business processes related to transportation activities and SDG 13. They include the use of geospatial technology for transportation and robotics for delivery activities. Improvements in production processes could support goal 12 by implementing alternative production systems such as 3D printing or optimizing the organization of activities with AI. A final observation concerns the use of blockchain in procurement activities, which covers three out of 13 rules, signaling the need to involve suppliers to support sustainable development and the usefulness of blockchain technology in managing buyer-supplier relationships from a sustainable perspective.   5 Discussion This study analyses the current literature at the intersection of digital technologies, business functions and processes, and SDGs. Starting from the criticism of the SDGs as difficult to measure, quantify, ambitious, and inconsistent (Swain, 2018 ), this section highlights the contribution of the study, trying to identify which digital technologies are most successfully used to achieve the SDGs in production systems and in which business functions and processes. The literature has highlighted how links between SBPs and the achievement of the SDGs for production systems are missing or uncertain. The weaknesses of the SDGs have been pointed out by some academics such as the lack of monitoring and evaluation indicators, the lack of specificity in the goals, and the ambiguity of the language used. However, other scholars have highlighted the need to provide further insights into the SDGs that can greatly advance theory and practice in production systems (Sarkis and Ibrahim, 2022 ). The importance of the SDGs relates to their usefulness for companies to communicate their SBPs to society. As highlighted by García-Meca and Martínez-Ferrero (2021) , the literature on the business effects of adopting these new sustainable practices is lacking, suggesting that the impacts related to achieving the SDGs are still unknown. Based on these gaps and controversies, in this study, for each dimension of sustainability - ‘biosphere’, ‘economy’, and ‘society’ - further clarifications and insights are provided on the relationship between SBP, digital technology adoption, and the achievement of the SDGs. From the results of association rules, the digital technologies most used in the achievement of specific SDGs in specific business functions and processes are discussed such that they are classified as potential best practices . Finally, a gap analysis is defined, and potential future research directions are shown. Although the study reveals various relevant and important contributions, it is clear that this is a fast-growing topic of interest that recommends opportunities for future research. 5.1 Integrated Model Before discussing in-depth the various insights that emerge from this research, a conceptual framework is provided that graphically clarifies the relationships between the three elements analyzed (a) digital technologies, (b) business functions and processes, and (c) SDGs. Fig. 6   presents an integrated model that supports the interpretation of the research findings (Liehr and Smith, 1999 ). It is represented as a target where the ultimate goal is the achievement of the SDGs. Specifically, the centre represents the ultimate sustainability goals to be achieved through digital technologies classified according to Dantas et al. (2021)  in the dimensions ‘biosphere’, ‘economy’, and ‘society’. The second level encompasses business functions and processes in which digital technologies can potentially be used to achieve the SDGs. The third level represents the digital technologies available in the current scenario. The conceptual framework shows the plurality of potential combinations to achieve sustainability goals. For example, the same digital technology can be applied either in a single business function or in a plurality of business functions. Similarly, the same digital technology can impact a single SDG or multiple SDGs. The perspective further changes when considering the role of different digital technologies within a single business function for the achievement of a specific SDG or multiple business functions for the achievement of various SDGs. Therefore, the novelty and contribution of the article are to assess the potential of using current digital technologies in specific business functions and business processes to achieve SDGs in production systems. The following sections will provide further insights into the several links identified between the three elements under investigation.  5.2 The Relationships between Digital Technologies and the SDGs The literature is rich in articles investigating the adoption of digital technologies and their applications in specific business functions and processes (Núñez-Merino et al., 2020 ; Zheng et al., 2021 ). Although there are several studies analyzing the adoption of technologies in production systems, they overlook and ignore the SDGs. Therefore, a first general analysis clarifies which technologies are most used to achieve specific SDGs in production systems. In general, AI and geospatial technologies favor SBPs aimed at achieving all SDGs except Goal 8. These two technologies can be considered ‘pervasive’ and easily adapted to different business functions and processes to enhance sustainable development. On the one hand, geospatial technologies gather crucial environmental information. They are effective for monitoring and managing energy resources, climate change, air and water quality (SDGs 6, 13, and 15). Moreover, GPS can support decision-makers to make better traffic management decisions and improve precision agriculture (SDGs 2, 3, and 7). In summary, data collection through these technologies supports the strategic planning and decision-making of sustainable activities to be carried out. In line with Vinuesa et al. (2020) , according to which AI can have a positive impact on all SDGs by improving the sustainable development of both society and the environment, this study highlights how crucial AI is in production systems. AI can learn from this georeferenced data and autonomously support, optimize, and improve decision-making processes. By storing high volumes of data from sensors, satellites, drones, and other technologies, AI can be used to predict energy demand and optimize energy production from renewable sources, reducing greenhouse gas emissions (SDG 7). It can improve the efficiency of production activities through sustainable production management algorithms and reducing waste (SDG 9). Finally, it is widely used to achieve Goal 12 to optimize the production of goods and waste management of production systems. Findings highlight how blockchain technology can foster SBPs in the achievement of several SDGs. Although it is a relatively new technology launched in 2008, its implementation is spreading in production systems (Varriale et al., 2023b ). Scholars have accelerated the study of this technology considering the sustainability aspects it can promote in firms. Although it is known that the mechanism of public blockchains consumes high energy resources (Alshahrani et al., 2023 ; Sedlmeir et al., 2020 ), this reasoning cannot be applied in private and consortium blockchains. In literature, several business case studies and simulations have found that technology can support decision-making processes to achieve the SDGs. In line with the studies by Dionisio et al. (2024)  on the role of digital social technologies in addressing SDGs, blockchain can support transparency, traceability, and efficient resource management by improving corporate social responsibility and ensuring transparency and fairness in contract and payroll management (SDG 8). It can track the product life cycle, improving supply chain transparency and encouraging responsible consumption (SDG 12). Finally, it can track greenhouse gas emissions, encouraging the transition to a low-carbon economy (SDG 13). This first contribution of the work is in line with previous scientific studies. It confirms the role of these technologies in sustainable development; however, it adds and details which SDGs can be achieved by implementing these technologies in companies.  5.3 Business Functions and Processes and the SDGs The second contribution of the paper identifies in which business functions and processes digital technologies are implemented to favor the achievement of the SDGs. Indeed, one of the critical issues found in the literature is the lack of clarity and inconsistency in defining in which business functions and processes new technologies can be applied to align them with the achievement of the SDGs (European Commission et al., 2021 ). Since 2015, there have been numerous statements of alignment between business goals and the achievement of the SDGs through sustainable environmental, social, and economic practices. Lashitew (2021)  in his study states that there is still significant uncertainty about which SBPs can be used to achieve the SDGs. Therefore, the contribution of this study fills the research gap presented by him as it provides detailed information on which fields and business areas digital technologies can be effectively and efficiently deployed in SBPs for the achievement of the SDGs. The study shows that digital technologies are implemented more in the operations functions such as ‘operations control’, ‘operations planning’, ‘production of goods’, and ‘provision of services’. Considering the scope of production systems, the focus on these business functions and processes is indicative. For instance, most digital technologies used in operations control and operations planning aim to collect data and information - i.e. IoT, proximity tech, geospatial tech, blockchain - and use them as a learning base for AI systems to monitor and support SBPs. Whereas, within business processes such as the production of goods and provision of service, the digital technologies used aim to take specific ‘actions’ to achieve the SDGs. For example, robotics and 3D printing are technologies to perform specific activities, reducing human labor and waste of resources. The use of autonomous robots and 3D printing can reduce energy consumption by contributing to the transition to renewable energy sources (SDG 7). Furthermore, robotics and 3D printing can contribute to enabling the circular economy, optimizing the use of natural resources (SDG 9). They can encourage the use of sustainable materials and the creation of high-quality, customized products while reducing the use of fossil fuels (SDGs 12 and 13). In addition to the ‘operations’ function, various digital technologies are employed in the ‘distribution’ function where delivery and transportation are presented. This business function is crucial for efficient operations management. For example, drones can be an excellent alternative in delivery to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (SDG 7). The use of AI and robotics can improve efficiency in delivery and transportation processes through route planning, optimizing resource consumption, promoting responsible business models, and contributing to preventing climate change (SDGs 9, 12, and 13). Among other business functions, those that can benefit from the use of digital technologies are ‘procurement’ and ‘G&A'. In the first category, digital technologies can support buyer-supplier relationships in achieving SDGs 12 and 13. In particular, they can be used to monitor and assess the environmental sustainability of suppliers, promoting more responsible practices by optimizing routes. This can be facilitated by blockchain, proximity, and geospatial technologies that aim to collect information and record it securely so that decision-makers can make informed decisions. In the second category, digital technologies are widely used to improve ‘strategic planning’ activities. This business process is considered critical as decisions made at an early stage of production systems management can have impacts on long-term sustainable implications. For instance, digital technologies can be used to assess the environmental impact of production activities and strategic decisions, by assessing greenhouse gas emissions using geospatial technologies (SDG 13). AI can simulate different energy production scenarios and assess the feasibility of implementing industrial plants to achieve Goal 7. This perspective mainly provides practical and managerial contributions as it highlights the opportunities of implementing digital technologies in production systems with a view to sustainable development. This is a novelty from previous studies that have associated digital technologies with the SDGs but ignoring and neglecting the business functions and processes in which these digital technologies can potentially be employed.  5.4 A Focus on the SDGs: Society, Biosphere, and Economy Dimensions This section explores and discusses the results considering the classification of the SDGs into macro-categories provided by Dantas et al. (2021) . By following this classification, it is possible to identify and observe aspects that have not been noted in previous discussions. As widely observed in the literature, current studies on sustainability have focused exclusively on environmental and economic sustainability (Grabowska et al., 2022 ; Harik and Hachem, 2015 ). Specifically, Cai and Choi (2020)  state how the same emphasis is not given to the different SDGs and some are still underexplored such as 1, 10, 14, and 15. Indeed, the social impact is the most difficult to assess objectively (Lashitew, 2021 ). This is a fundamental point of the Industry 5.0 paradigm that recognizes the contribution of industry to achieving social goals by identifying the well-being of the worker for the production activities (European Commission et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2021 ). This study is in line with previous analyses; however, it offers further insights and identifies some potential of digital technologies in production systems also for the social dimension. It is possible to state that for the ‘Society’ dimension, i.e., the aspect of sustainability that focuses on the impact of human activities on people's well-being, the technologies most frequently used in the business case studies analyzed are AI, geospatial technologies, and robotics. In addition, the business processes most considered by scholars are ‘operations control’, ‘production of goods’, and ‘delivery’. This result reflects an important research point. These digital technologies can play an important role in the promotion of social sustainability through the collection and analysis of socio-economic and geospatial data by providing solutions to hunger reduction and worker welfare (SDGs 2 and 3). However, while geospatial technologies are used purely for monitoring and planning, AI and robotics support tangible physical activities in improving social aspects. It is evident that several technologies are missing from this study that could potentially foster sustainable social practices such as the use of immersive environments, virtual reality, computing, and open collaboration platforms. Moreover, the business functions and processes in which these digital technologies are employed are limited. There is a plethora of business functions and processes that could benefit from sustainable social practices supported by digital technologies in production systems such as the HR function. Considering the SDGs grouped in the macro-categories ‘Biosphere’ and ‘Economy’, it is possible to highlight how several digital technologies are implemented in different business functions processes. Production systems are increasingly moving toward improving sustainability performance related to SDGs 6 and 13. These goals are easier to achieve in these business functions and processes because they focus on action facing climate change and water sanitation. Empirical evidence is supported by the study of Dantas et al. (2021)  who combine circular economy practices and digital technologies to support SDGs 7, 12, and 13. The use of digital technologies can be a valuable solution to achieve these goals through the adoption of sustainable production practices and the promotion of eco-sustainable behavior. In line with the study by Bai et al. (2020) , sensors and data analysis tools can identify areas where carbon emissions or pollutants are highest and implement actions to reduce them. In contrast to the literature that intercepts few SBPs for SDG 15 (Cai and Choi, 2020 ), this study highlights how geospatial technologies can improve specific business functions and processes of production systems. The SDGs related to the ‘Economy’ dimension have been most studied and analyzed in production systems. This is evident both in the wide range of digital technologies used and their application in various business functions and processes. SDG 12 has more SBPs because it is closely linked to production systems. In this category, robotics, blockchain, and AI are the main digital technologies to address the issues of the ‘Economy’ dimension. For the achievement of SDG 12, several business areas are involved that are not relevant in the other dimensions. Many digital technologies are implemented in different business functions such as ‘distribution’, ‘marketing’ and ‘procurement’ that enclose specific business processes such as ‘inventory’, ‘reverse logistics’, ‘market analysis’, ‘buyer-supplier relationships’, ‘order management - purchasing’ and ‘supplier evaluation and selection’. This highlights how research and scholars have focused on this goal by attempting to spread these SBPs across different business functions and processes and not limited to the ‘operations’ function. This is important because it shows that there is a deeper maturity and awareness of the potential of digital technologies in achieving this specific goal. In general, the 2030 Agenda should not be a constraint for companies, rather it should be seen as an opportunity to improve their business practices. Companies can use the SDGs as internal target goals and provide their organization with sustainable development indicators to achieve them. The support of new digital technologies can contribute to the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the entire ecosystem.  5.5 The Most ‘Stable’ SBPs Based on Digital Technologies The article provides an important contribution in investigating which specific digital technologies are most stably used in SBPs in specific business processes to achieve a specific SDG. These links were developed by adopting association rules that are a powerful AI algorithm. Indeed, among the more than 7000 possible opportunities to support the SDGs by implementing digital technologies within business processes in the sample, this research suggests 13 robust models that are ready to be adopted in business functions and processes. The high confidence value for SBPs related to SDG 7 indicates that the digital technologies used are more widely employed in those specific business processes. They assume greater relevance because they have been repeatedly adopted in business case studies, and they can be recognized as enablers of sustainable social development. In this case, AI and geospatial technologies are mainly used for monitoring and planning activities and do not intervene directly in production activities. SDGs 6 and 13 related to the ‘Biosphere’ dimension are associated with technologies that collect and record data and information such as geospatial technologies and blockchain on ‘buyer-supplier relationships’, ‘transportation’, and ‘operations control’. This information can be crucial to support decision-makers in specific processes. However, drones and autonomous vehicles can be used in delivery to reduce environmental impacts. Within SDG 12, different digital technologies are present in various aspects of production systems. This denotes how the literature has widely analyzed and studied digital technologies considering different perspectives and different business areas in production systems to reach SDG 12. These associations can delineate patterns that are more consistently found in the literature. Therefore, the technology-business process-SDG combinations identified in this study represent the most relevant and frequent patterns in the analyzed business case studies. In this way, the combination of these three aspects can be quantified to be rigorously relevant to advise and suggest to managers which are the most ‘stable’ associations between technology and business process for the achievement of a specific SDG.  5.6 Gap Analysis and Future Research Directions In summary, the study reveals several research gaps. For instance, not all technologies mentioned are useful and available for the achievement of the SDGs. In addition, many of the business functions and processes considered for production systems have not been considered and analyzed in the scientific literature from a sustainable development perspective. Finally, this study identified several gaps in the adoption of digital technologies to achieve SDGs in production systems. Firstly, some digital technologies in this study are not widely used in the business case studies collected. There are many reasons behind this research gap. The first reason is that the digital technologies considered are relatively new and innovative, so their potential impacts on sustainable development are unknown. In some cases, the implementation of certain digital technologies has low success in business operations for achieving the SDGs. It is possible that they mainly aim at optimizing and maintaining a competitive advantage but neglect sustainable development issues. Another justification is that researchers, managers, and practitioners have not yet adopted certain technologies in different business functions and processes and do not completely appreciate their potential in other business areas. Finally, some of these technologies are truly emerging and therefore these fields of research are still unexplored. The study conducted shows that technologies such as computing, digital applications, open and crowd-based platforms, and immersive environments are less used for the achievement of SDGs. To date, the application of these technologies in production systems can be a challenge. Being relatively new technologies, there is limited awareness of their application and effectiveness for sustainable development. Moreover, companies may be discouraged from applying them due to the excessive financial and technological demands involved. Their adoption would involve the acquisition of specific technical skills that may not be available within many organizations. Among the reasons for a lack of use of these technologies in production systems is the limited availability of access to reliable internet connections in various locations around the world or a lack of technological knowledge. Despite these challenges, there are several applications of these digital technologies that can potentially be used to achieve the SDGs, such as mobile applications for training and education of workers, applications for data collection and monitoring, and applications for public engagement and awareness-raising. Moreover, quantum computing could be used to optimize the design, placement, and operation of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar farms. It could simulate complex climate models with greater accuracy providing a better understanding of the dynamics of climate change and developing strategies for achieving SDG 13. In many cases, these digital technologies can be used in combination with other technologies, such as AI, IoT, and blockchain, to increase the effectiveness and impact of solutions for the SDGs. Secondly, SBPs have been identified for not all business functions and processes. There are several sustainable development-oriented practices in specific operations processes such as ‘operations’, ‘distribution’, and ‘procurement’. These business functions are the key and core functions of production systems. In literature, most studies analyze and investigate the use of these digital technologies in these core processes to achieve the SDGs. However, there are other ancillary business functions that can benefit from the use of technologies, but which have been less studied and investigated. They are ‘A&F', ‘HR’, ‘ICT’, ‘marketing’ and ‘R&D'. Indeed, there are digital technologies in the literature that support these business functions, but they are limited to a few business case studies. For example, in ‘A&F', blockchain can increase transparency and efficiency in the management of financial flows and adopt sustainable transactions. However, the adoption of these technologies may be slowed by the limited availability of environmental and social data to assess the impact of financial investments. Moreover, mobile applications, open-access platforms, and immersive environments can help improve employee training, engagement, and management, including the promotion of diversity and inclusion. These SBPs are less employed because it is complex to strike a balance between the use of digital technologies and human interaction to ensure sustainable employee relations. In ‘marketing’, there are several challenges to consider in finding the balance between using digital technologies and addressing the risk of greenwashing. In ‘R&D', digital technologies can support various SBPs for prototyping and developing new products using immersive environments. Also, in this case, a trade-off should be found between the use of digital technologies and human creativity. Thirdly, the research offers several insights into the lack of contributions of digital technology applications to the achievement of specific SDGs in production systems. Considering social SDGs 1, 4, 5, 11, and 16 are insufficiently represented in literature. For example, the use of digital technologies could be useful in crowdfunding initiatives for poverty reduction among farmers. SDG 4 on the development and delivery of training and education receives little attention from academics, managers, and practitioners. However, the use of digital applications and immersive environments such as gamification could improve the safety and efficiency of workers in the workplace. One of the most overlooked SDGs in the production systems literature is SDG 5 - gender equality. This goal includes problems of inclusion and justice that have little appeal to scholars in production systems, especially considering the adoption of digital technologies. In this research, both SDG 11 and 16 were less investigated because the themes of these two goals were hardly associated with production systems and the use of digital technologies. In this case, these two goals relating to the ‘Social’ dimension were found to have a weak connection with production systems. Regarding the ‘Biosphere’ dimension, there is a lack of contributions of digital technologies in production systems for SDG 14. Research could investigate issues such as maritime transport that may have implications for ocean life. For example, the fishing industry and seafood may also fall under SDG 14, but still, these topics are little explored when considering digital technologies. Finally, the literature has a research gap on the use of digital technologies to achieve SDGs 10 and 17 related to the ‘Economic’ dimension. Indeed, no contributions have been found on the use of digital technologies to reduce economic inequalities and on partnership for goals in production systems.  5.7 Implications for Policymakers This research provides policymakers with recommendations aimed at harnessing the potential of digital technologies to drive the objectives outlined in the 2030 Agenda. Through its findings, the study illustrates which digital technologies have the greatest potential for contributing to the achievement of these goals. This understanding is pivotal for directing investments and funding toward specific digital technologies for supporting various aspects of sustainable development. Furthermore, the article provides policymakers with guidelines for business strategies concerning the allocation of funds toward particular technologies and facilitating the dissemination of research grants. By identifying the digital technologies that are employed most for the achievement of SDGs, policymakers can strategically promote their adoption in specific business processes. Specifically, this study sheds light on the links between digital technologies and the achievement of SDGs by favoring specific financing initiatives for the adoption of certain digital technologies. For instance, the study emphasizes the role of AI, blockchain, geospatial technologies, IoT, and 3D printing in advancing SDGs 6, 7, 12, and 13 within different business processes. By prioritizing the integration of these technologies, policymakers stand to raise their impact on specific SDGs, thereby accelerating progress toward the objectives of sustainable development.   6 Conclusions The novelty of this article is studying the link between digital technologies and the SDGs and clarifying the business functions and processes where this link is most promising by deriving information from scientific research. Indeed, the literature is rich in case studies, simulations, and models that suggest how to effectively implement technologies from the sustainability perspective. Therefore, by deriving a dataset through the classification of SBPs within scientific articles, it is possible to provide the state of the art of this less explored relationship. The results suggest that some technologies are appropriate to support the achievement of the SDGs, while there are many application contexts that are less studied. In particular, the literature is still too focused on environmental implications, while social issues are in the minority. The paper suggests that scholars should better investigate the role of technologies in supporting not only environmental and economic goals but also social ones. There is a need to build a robust and established set of business practices that employ technology to support social sustainability. This overview can be useful for practitioners and managers to understand the opportunities of using specific technologies to achieve certain SDGs and be highly sustainable in the global scenario. Indeed, among more than 7000 possible opportunities to support the SDGs by implementing Industry 4.0 technologies within 42 business processes, this research suggests 13 robust models that are ready to be adopted in business functions and processes. As the practices recorded in the dataset have proven their usefulness in terms of improving performance, this research aims to stimulate companies to implement technologies to both improve their profitability and support the achievement of the SDGs. A final remark considers the limitations of the study. In particular, the data were collected from business cases from the scientific literature, so it is impossible to declare that all applications and case studies were considered: the scholars may not have yet analyzed some opportunities for the achievement of SDGs. Moreover, the article exclusively focuses on the positive impact of digital technologies on SBPs. This could lead to research bias. However, literature on case studies, simulations, and pilot projects emphasizes the advantages of implementing specific technologies in business processes and overlooks or ignores the critical issues that come with their adoption. Future research could explore how the combination and connection of different technologies can improve the sustainable development of production systems from the perspective of Industry 5.0.
