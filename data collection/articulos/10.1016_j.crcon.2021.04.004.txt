                  Living organisms' energy conversion is considered as an essential and sustainable green energy source and future bio-hybrid technologies. Recently, plants were used after harvesting as biomass in bio-fermentation as an energy source. In bio-electrochemical systems, microorganisms work with plants to generate electricity, hydrogen, or methane. This work discusses the simultaneous pollutant removal and electricity generation in plant-based bio-electrochemical systems (P-BES). Factors affecting the P-BES performance and the removal efficiencies of the different organic and inorganic pollutants were illustrated. Furthermore, the plant-based bioelectrochemical systems' role in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) was discussed. The SDGs contribution of plant-based bioelectrochemical systems were presented and discussed to evaluate such systems' ability to achieve the three pillars of sustainable development, i.e., economic, environmental, and social.

Recently, plants were used after harvesting as biomass in bio-fermentation as an energy source. In bio-electrochemical systems, microorganisms work with plants to generate electricity, hydrogen, or methane. This work discusses the simultaneous pollutant removal and electricity generation in plant-based bio-electrochemical systems (P-BES). Factors affecting the P-BES performance and the removal efficiencies of the different organic and inorganic pollutants were illustrated. Furthermore, the plant-based bioelectrochemical systems' role in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) was discussed. The SDGs contribution of plant-based bioelectrochemical systems were presented and discussed to evaluate such systems' ability to achieve the three pillars of sustainable development, i.e., economic, environmental, and social.   Keywords Plant  Bioelectrochemical systems  Sustainable development goals, pollutant removal  Power generation    1 Introduction Fossil fuel is a form of solar energy stored in the dead organisms and transferred into fuel by a natural process, i.e., anaerobic decomposition. This process takes millions of years to occur, producing coal, natural gas, or petroleum containing high carbon content. Due to the depletion and the environmental problems of fossil fuels [1–3] , using renewable and sustainable energy sources has become a critical request to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [4,5] . The earth received a massive amount of solar radiation, around 174 PW (petawatts). Landmasses, oceans, and clouds absorb 70% of this amount. Renewable energy sources such as solar [6,7] , geothermal [8,9] , biomass [10,11] , wind [12] , and ocean [13]  energies are sustainable with low environmental impacts. Therefore there is a rapid growth in applying renewable energy sources in different applications. Among the various renewable energy sources, biomass [11,14]  and solar energies are the most abundant with cost-effective energy conversion technologies. Bio-electrochemical systems (BESs) are devices that use the catalytic activity of living microorganisms to metabolites high molecular weight organic matter into simple ones or CO2  (end product) through a series of biological reactions [15,16] . There are various types of BESs such as microbial fuel cell (MFC) [17] , sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC), BESs for hydrogen or chemical production, i.e., microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), microbial electrolysis chemical production cell (MECC), microbial desalination cells (MDC), and microbial electrolysis desalination cell (MEDC). These systems are efficient energy conversion devices that demonstrated promising results in different applications such as CO2  capturing [18] , bioremediation [19] , wastewater treatment [20,21] , and water desalination [22] . Such systems are flexible in operation, easy installation, and environmentally friendly technology. BESs are considered energy harvesting devices that use living microorganisms to extract the chemical energy stored in different wastes and convert them directly to other energy forms. Photosynthetic organisms can use light energy to produce electricity or any other energy carrier using BESs. The light-based BESs can be categorized according to the type of organism used at the anode side to i) photosynthetic BESs where anoxic photosynthetic organisms are used at the anode side to produce energy, ii) biophotovoltaic systems (BPV) using oxygenic photo organisms (OPM) which can perform photosynthesis process at the anode chamber producing energy directly, and iii) complex photosynthetic BESs that uses two types of microorganisms at the anode side (one is anoxic photosynthetic microorganism and the other type is heterotrophic microorganisms) [23] . In 2015, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by all the world nations. The SDGs covered the three pillars of sustainable development, namely prosperity, planet, and people. The SDGs provide a platform for all countries to measure the contribution toward sustainability. United Nations Conference on Trade and Development estimates that to meet the SDGs by 2030, a total of $3.3 trillion and $4.5 trillion investments are required annually by developing countries [8] . Determining and analyzing the contribution of the products or services into SDGs can help the stakeholder create a policy supporting SDGs' work. Therefore, finance and allocate the investments into the correct place or technology. Target 7.2 under SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) is calling to “increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix substantially by 2030”. The latest number from United Nations indicates that the current share is far from aimed Targets [24] . Moreover, Target 6.3 under SDG 6 calls to “improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally” by 2030. Like Target 7.2, the latest number shows that this Target requires a lot of effort as it is far from being achieved [25] . One of the promised technologies that can aid in reaching the SDGs is P-BES. P-BES have the capabilities to treat the wastewater (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being and SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation), provide a sustainable source of energy (SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy and provides), add a value (SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and reduce the overall emissions SDG 13: Climate Action). These contributions and other contributions will be discussed in this work. Although a large number of work was done to summarize the different types of bio-electrochemical systems, i.e., microbial fuel cells [16] , microbial desalination cells [22] , microbial electrolysis cells [26] , few efforts have been made to summarize plant-based BES. Moreover, based on the authors' best knowledge, there is no work done to link plant-based bio-electrochemical systems with the SDGs. This work summarized the recent progress in plant-based bio-electrochemical systems and their contribution in the SDGs.  2 Principles of Plant-based BES (P-BES) Plants produce organic materials (carbohydrates) during the photosynthesis process using the green pigments in their leaves (chlorophyll). These carbohydrates are the primary energy source for living organisms that directly ate the plants or fed on other organisms that ate the plants. Around 40% of carbohydrates produced are consumed by the plants themselves with perfusion of the residual half to the root (rhizosphere), where they are broken by the microorganisms existing in the soil producing electrons. If the plants are used in the anode chamber of BESs, they will produce electricity. Such a system is known as plant-based BES (P-BES). The P-BESs depend on the photosynthesis process by the plant to produce the carbohydrates (organic compounds). Then the plant excretes the unused carbohydrates by rhizodeposition where they are electrochemically oxidized by the microorganisms existing in the soil around the plant root or externally added from another source to produce electrons and protons. The electrons and protons are transferred to the cathode side through an external circuit and ionic electrolyte, respectively. The electrons and protons react with oxygen from the air or any other electron acceptor producing water at the cathode. The mechanism of the plant-based MFC is shown in Fig. 1  . 2.1 The function of the plant in plant-based BESs: Plant roots absorb water from the soil and transfer it to the leaves through the stem. Water reacted with carbon dioxide fixed from the atmosphere by plant leaves in sunlight via the photosynthesis process using chlorophyll. Almost 47.25 billion tons of carbon that the plants fix transported to the root and then to the rhizosphere as exudates rich in carbohydrates, gases, ethylene, dead cell materials, enzymes, and CO2  via rhizodeposition process [27,28] . The exudates supply the rhizospheric microorganisms with carbohydrates, amino acids, and others to perform cell respiration and other cell activities [29] . Plants are classified according to the photosynthesis pathway to C3, C4, and CAM [30] . C4 plants are the most proper type as it converts the CO2  to a 4-carbon sugar compound and enters the Calvin cycle [31] . This plant type is highly efficacious in the dry, hot atmosphere and produces a considerable amount of bioenergy [32] . C4 plants introduce more rhizodeposition as a substrate for the microorganisms near the root, enhancing the power regeneration in the plant-based microbial fuel cell (P-MFC) [33] . Around 3% of the plant species (8100), including grass species, employ C4 carbon fixation [34] . The rhizospheric microorganisms are used as biocatalysts in P-BES; these microorganisms use the root exudates as electron donner and transfer the liberated electrons to the anode surface directly or indirectly.  2.2 Bio-photovoltaics (BPV) Bio-photovoltaic ( BPV) system harvests green energy directly using the natural photosynthesis process [35] . BPV system uses photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria, algae, and green plants. These organisms use the sunlight to convert water to electrons and protons, produce oxygen as a by-product, and reduce the carbon in the carbon dioxide molecule and fix it into multi-carbon units considered the main energy source organisms [36] . For the plant-based BPV, the microorganisms in the plant roots themselves are used to metabolite the plant's organic material during photosynthesis without using any other (external) microorganisms or substrate. Thus, BPV systems use sunlight, water, and CO2  to produce electrical energy directly. Two types of current could be acquired in the BPV system; i) photocurrent, which is the current produced during the photosynthesis process using the sunlight (illumination source), and ii) dark current (delayed photocurrent), which is the current generated in the absence of light where the microorganisms used the endogenously stored carbohydrates (excess carbohydrates that produced during photosynthesis process) [37] . A BPV was studied using two different plants Oryza sativa L.  and Echinochloa glabrescens (Munro ex Hook. f),  under same operating conditions [38] . The two plants were kept to growth for 8 days; the average power generation of BPV based on O. sativa was 0.980 ± 0.059 GJ / ha year compared to 0.088 ± 0.008 GJ /ha year in the case of BPV using E. glabrescens.  This was related to the higher electrogenic activity of O. sativa  than that of E. glabrescens  (produced charge around six times faster). Algae (Chlorella Vulgaris ) based BPV was recently constructed for the generation of green energy. The surface area, total pore volume, and the electron transfer rate were enhanced by modifying the carbon cloth (anode) with a nanocomposite of hierarchical nanostructure of FeWO4 /CeO2  on rGO [39] . The modified anode cell demonstrated a higher performance as the maximum power density increased from 8.34 to 80 mW/m2  (nearly ten times higher). Embolization of algae in alginate gel improved the power output of algae-based BPV by 18%, reaching a maximum power density of 0.289 mW/m2 [40] . The influence of light quality on photosynthesis efficiency, biomass production, and power output was also investigated in algae “Chlorella UMACC 313 ” based BPV; a maximum power density of 0.45 mW/m2  was achieved [41] . Two types of light, programmable LED arrays (PLA) and white LED were examined in BPV based on Chlorella , showing that when PLA was used as a light source, a maximum power density of 0.581 mW/m2  was obtained, which was 188% higher than that using white LED light source [42] .  2.3 Factors affecting the performance of P-BESs In P-BES, microorganisms in the soil around the plant root or externally added to the system use the plant's root exudates as a fuel to generate bioelectricity. The efficiency of the P-BESs is affected by several parameters such as the humidity, pH, temperature, weather, type of the soil, type of the plant, illumination, type of the microorganisms, the configuration of the system, type of the electrodes, and with or without membrane, as shown in Table1  .   3 Application of P-BESs P-BESs are considered renewable energy resources as they can produce electricity continuously simultaneously with hazard removal. In such a system, the plant plays a critical role in converting the sunlight directly to electricity through the rhizosphere to remove pollutants. The various applications of P-BESs such as Sediment MFC, rice paddy field, and Phytoremediation were summarized in the following sections. 3.1 Sediment MFC (S-MFC) S-MFCs are microbial fuel cells that use the sediment's microorganisms to remove the organic materials from the sediment and produce electricity [51] . The S-MFC consists of an anode electrode that is immersed in the sediment and a cathode electrode that is suspended in overlying water [60] . Recently, different plants are planted in the anode of S-MFC; therefore, the plant introduces more organic materials to the microorganisms. Also, the interaction between the microorganisms in the rhizosphere and those in the sediment could enhance the biodegradation process [61] . The removal of high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HMW-PAHs) was improved when the macrophyte Acorus calamus was planted in the anode of sediment microbial fuel cell (S-MFC) as the degradation rate of pyrene and benzopyrene was increased by 70% because of the interaction between aerobic and anaerobic consortia in rhizosphere and sediment, respectively, which perform aerobic/anaerobic metabolism [62] . S-MFC with Eichhornia crassipes was constructed for wastewater treatment and power generation [63] . The plant rhizosphere increased the organic substances in the wastewater, which positively affected the power generation, and COD, turbidity, volatile fatty acid (VFA), nitrate, and color removal efficiencies [63] . The root exudates of wetland “ Ipomoea Aquatica ” were used as a substrate in a single chamber, membrane-free MFC. However, the COD removal efficiency in planted MFC was slightly higher than that of unplanted MFC; the power density of planted MFC was significantly higher by 142% than that of the unplanted one [64] .  3.2 Rice paddy field MFC Rice paddy field is a good medium to build effective plant-based MFCs. An MFC was constructed to harvest energy in a rice paddy field as the anode was placed in the rice rhizosphere [50] . The acetate was the primary organic substance exhausted from the roots and used by the soil's microorganisms as a fuel for producing electrons and protons. The photosynthesis process is essential for the power output as shading of the plants dramatically decreased the power generation, whereas there was a remarkable change when the cathode surface was shaded. Adding acetate to the anode rhizosphere promoted the power output during no sunlight (dark) where the plants could not produce organic materials. The power output reached around 50% of its value during the daytime. Another study was conducted to identify the microorganisms in the anode of S-MFC operated in a rice paddy field [65] . This study demonstrated that the Geobacteraceae  species, especially G. Psychrophilus , grew on the anode's rhizosphere region and interacted with the microorganisms secrete electron donors, causing power generation. Biochar granules or carbon felt were used as anode materials P-MFC where rice plant was grown in the anode chamber [66] . The performance was evaluated with and without rice plant (SMFC). It was observed that the performance of P-MFC was higher than those of SMFC, and the performance using the carbon felt was better than that using the biochar in terms of power generation, as shown in Fig. 2  . However, the biochar decreased the emission of methane without affecting the yield of plant biomass. One of the problems associated with rice agriculture is methane emission, as it produced 9–19% of the total emission of methane. This occurs due to the series of anaerobic biochemical reactions in which the complex organic matters are decomposed to simple ones than acetic acid, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Finally, they are converted to methane via methanogenic microorganisms (acetoclastic or hydrogenotrophic methanogens). A plant-based BES was investigated to overcome such an environmental issue by introducing a rice plant, “Oryza sativa”. Also, the anode of a BES was introduced in the rhizosphere of rice plants (Oryza sativa), and the effect of the methane emissions was investigated. The current generated from this system delayed the emission of methane. The bioelectrochemical method in the water-logged Rhizosphere contributed to a current-generation before methane emissions began, likely leading to a short-term pause in methane emissions from such anoxic systems. However, due to excess organic matter in the rhizosphere over the long term (i.e., the entire rice season), low methane emissions could not be sustained. The rhizosphere and anode group analysis showed that H2  is the most important precursor to methane production. A hybrid strategy with other methane mitigation methods would be envisaged for a realistic, large-scale use of a bioelectrochemical method to reduce methane emissions. The pollution of rice baddy with toxic heavy metal could also be decreased by planting the rice in MFC [67] . Applying MFC in the rice plant reduced the masses of Cu, Cd, Ni, and Cr in the grains by 32.8%, 35.1%, 21.3%, and 56.9 % [67] .  3.3 Phytoremediation-PMFC hybrid system Contamination of water and soil with organic or inorganic pollutants demonstrates severe environmental impacts that cause many health threats for humans and all life forms. Plants play a significant role in removing contaminants with their attendant microorganisms via the phytoremediation process [68,69] . During this process, the plant accumulates the organic and inorganic pollutants, metabolizes the organic wastes, and stimulates the microbial decay of organic wastes in the rhizosphere zone [70,71] . Phytoremediation is an autonomous method for pollutant removal that is environmentally friendly, cost-effective, relevant for surface and groundwater, sediments, soil, and sludge [72] . Phyto-power system is a hybrid system of P-BES and phytoremediation for simultaneous bioenergy generation and contaminants removal (organic and/or inorganic) from the soil or water [73] . This system can sustainably harvest energy from anaerobic respiration of microorganisms around the plant root in a clean, low-cost, and effective way [74,75] . The combination between plant based MFC and phytoremediation was summarized in table 2  . Some examples of the application of a hybrid system of P-BES and phytoremediation are given below.- Boron removal     Boron (B) is sometimes found in irrigation water. If the concentration exceeds, it will affect aquatic, wild organisms, and human beings. Removal or reducing the concentration of B with conventional methods is comparatively difficult. Türker et al. examined different MFC modules based on duckweed with mono or polycultures, i.e., L. gibba, L. minor , or both, to determine the most proper duckweed species to remove the boron from the water of irrigation [76] . This study revealed that for an initial B concentration of 4 mg/L, the MFC based on L.gibba  achieved the highest B removal of 71% and generated a maximum power density of 17783 mW/m2 . When the B concentration exceeds 4 mg/L, the removal efficiency decreased for all modules, and when it reached 32 mg/L, it drastically reduced because the biomass production was deficient and the chlorophyll level was decreased remarkably. Duckweed, Lemna gibba L , based MFC (DWWT-MFC) was constructed and operated to remove boron from domestic wastewater [77] . The MFC performance and the boron removal efficiency were investigated under various conditions such as the presence and absence of plant and aeration. The highest voltage and power density of 1.4 V and 34.8 mW/m2 , respectively, were realized for MFC using plant and under aeration conditions, as seen in Fig. 3  (a). A high boron removal of 71% was achieved for MFC with plant, while aeration has a negligible effect, as seen in Fig. 3 (b).- Lead removal     Lead is a hazardous material that negatively affects the human body as it piles in the skeletons, damages DNA, proteins, and lipids. It can also replace the ions of the essential metals such as Fe, Zn, and Ca ions [78–80] . Lead is present in the wastewater from the battery industry with a high concentration (5–15 mg/L) [81,82]  and must be decreased to 0.015 mg/L according to the US EPA [83,84] . Such wastewater is almost treated using chemical or physiochemical techniques, but these techniques consume chemicals and/or energy [85–87] . Zhao et al. fabricated an MFC based on the wetland to remove Pb from wastewater [88] . The authors studied the effect of Pb (5 mg/L) on wastewater treatment efficiency, power generation, and the microbial community. This study revealed that the presence of Pb(II) decreased the internal resistance of the MFC and thus increased the power density from 3.873 to 7.432 mW/m2 . Still, it negatively affected the removal efficiency of NH4 + -N as it negatively affected the microbial community diversity and species richness. The removal efficiency of Pb from wastewater reached around 85% and the microbial community was adaptated to Pb(II) with long term operation.- Zn removal     Zn is an abundant element on the earth as it comes in 24th of most abundant elements [89] . Zinc is an essential trace element for all living things as it is an enzyme cofactor and constituent of many proteins [90,91] . However, Zn's high concentration causes a toxic effect on all living things [89,92] . A wetland-based MFC was constructed to remove Zn(II) from wastewater achieving 98.5 % removal of Zn(II) [93] . Zn(II) significantly decreased TP's removal efficiency (total phosphorous) from 91% to 75.6%. It slightly decreased TN (total nitrogen) removal efficiencies, NH4 + -N, and COD from 72.05%, 85.9%, and 84.94% to 68.87%, 80.4%, and 79.83%, respectively. Although Zn(II) decreased the MFC's internal resistance, the power density decreased little from 3.87 to 3.67 mW/m2 .- Chromium (hexavalent) removal     Chromium is used in many industries such as leather tanning, nuclear reactors, electroplating, and pigment and steel industry [94] . Therefore, a lot of wastewater contaminated with chromium is produced. Generally, chromium exists in wastewater in two forms Cr(III), trivalent, Cr(VI), or hexavalent. A trace amount of Cr(III) is essential for human beings as it helps the human body to use protein, fat, and sugar; however Cr(VI) is highly toxic for all living things [95,96] . The removal of various chromium concentrations using P-MFC, was investigated [97] . The authors revealed that the Cr removal efficiency and the columbic efficiencies increased from 90.3% to 99% and from 2.05% to 4.12%, respectively, by increasing the chromium concentration from 9.5 to 19 mg/L. This system could be operated for a long time for Cr removal. The chromium was removed by precipitate as Cr(OH)3  or by adsorbed onto the electrodes, and only a little soluble Cr(lll) remained in the P-MFC. When acetate was used as a substrate in the same MFC, its consumption was low using the plant (15–22% of that without using plants). The consumption of acetate in P-MFC might be related to the direct reduction of Cr(Vl), biomass growth, or other electron acceptors by the microorganisms (nitrate or oxygen). Wetland-MFC was constructed to remove the Cr(VI) from wastewater [98] . Several factors were investigated, i.e., the space between the anode and cathode, hydraulic retention time (HRT), the concentration of Cr, and COD concentration. Cr(VI) highest removal efficiency of 93.4% was achieved using Cr (VI) of 40 mg/L and 10 cm electrode spacing. However, a maximum power density of 458.2 mW/m2  was obtained using Cr(VI) and COD concentrations of 60 and 500 mg/L, respectively, achieving removal efficiencies of 90.7% Cr(VI) and 92.5% COD. Another study investigated a sediment MFC with Ipomoea Aquatica to remove Cr(VI) from wastewater [94] . Different initial concentrations of Cr(VI) (4.97, 10.29, and 21.16 mg/L) were examined, the maximum power density of 75 mW/m2  and the highest removal efficiency of Cr(VI) of 99.76% was achieved when the initial concentration of Cr(VI) was 21.16 mg/L.- Ni removal     Nickel (Ni) is used in many applications such as stainless steel industry, catalysts, rechargeable batteries, plating, and coinage [99–102] . Also, Ni is an essential trace element for living things; however, it is dangerous when it exceeds a definite amount. High Ni concentration can cause severe diseases for humans and animals [103] . Removal of Ni from various wastes is considered an obligate request. A hybrid P-MFC- phytoremediation system was examined for Ni removal [104] . Three systems were investigated, including P-MFC, phytoremediation, and combination between them. The combination of P-MFC and phytoremediation enhanced the performance of both solo processes. The hybrid system showed three times higher power output than P-MFC, and Ni ions uptake doubled compared to phytoremediation only. The increase in the power was related to the decrease in the ohmic resistance and further terminal electron acceptor. The Ni ions uptake's improvement was related to the plant's physiological change because of the electrical stimulation, charge separation, and or system polarization.- Cu removal     Copper is an essential element considered as metalloenzymes that act as an electron acceptor or donner [105] . A high copper concentration negatively affects the human being, causing severe diseases also causes toxicity for the plant [105,106] . P-MFCs with two different plants named Azolla pinnata  and Lemna minor  were recently constructed and examined for cupper uptake [74] . The presence of copper ions decreased the internal resistance of the P-MFC and thus increased the power density from 0.00334 to 0.01782 mW/m2  for Azolla pinnata  based MFC and from 0.2471 to 1.0761 mW/m2  for Lemna minor. When a hybrid system of the P-MFC and phytoremediation was used, the cupper uptake enhanced by 18% and 38% for Azolla pinnata and Lemna minor, respectively, compared to phytoremediation.- Oil removal     Massive oily wastewater is discharged from oil refining, transportation, and petrochemical industries [107] . Drainage of oily wastewater harms groundwater resources, aquatic life, crop production, and human health [108] . The conventional approaches for the treatment of oily wastewater are highly energy-consuming processes [59] . A wetland-based MFC was used to treat oily wastewater, achieving a high oil removal efficiency of 95.7%, COD removal rate of 75% simultaneously with bioelectricity generation [59] .- Nitrobenzene (NB) removal     Nitrobenzene (NB) is found with a high concentration in industrial wastewater discharged from drugs, dyes, organic intermediates, pesticides, and explosive industries [109] . NB is considered a dangerous pollutant as it has a stable chemical structure, extremely toxic, and causes dangerous health issues [110] . The wastewater contaminated with NB is usually treated with active carbon adsorption or supercritical water oxidation. Such processes are high energy consumption, secondary pollution production, and low degradation rate [111,112] . Recently a biological method using constructed wetland was successfully used to treat wastewater contaminated with NB, achieving a high NB removal efficiency of 95% at a low NB concentration of 70 mg/L, while it reached 57% at a high NB concentration of 160 mg/L. At high NB concentration, higher removal efficiency of NB could be achieved using a large constructed wetland area, but this isn't easy [113] . An MFC was made based on a constructed wetland to treat wastewater polluted with different NB concentrations (20, 120, and 200 mg/L). Three other plant species (Scirpus Validus, Typha Orientalis, and Iris pseudacorus)  were investigated. Scirpus Validus  grew well even at high NB concentration (200 mg/L) while part of Iris pseudacorus  and Typha Orientalis  died. Another study investigated the effect of the hydraulic retention time (HRT), the distance between the anode and cathode, and the concentration ratio of NB and COD in wetland-based MFC [114] . A high NB removal rate of ~ 93% was achieved at 24 h HRT using NB to COD ratio of 1:16.- Salinity removal     Saline wastewater is produced from many industries such as leather, agro-food, and petrochemicals industries [115,116] . Discharging saline wastewater without proper treatment negatively affects the ecosystem [117] . Conventional chemical or physical methods used to treat saline wastewater are expensive or result in secondary pollutions [118] . Biological treatment is preferable from the economic and environmental points of view [119] . A wetland-based MFC was designed to treat saline wastewater [120] . The salinity of the wastewater significantly enhanced the power generation by four times as the salinity increased the ionic strength, thus decreased the internal resistance. It is also found that salinity had a little effect on the TP and COD removal efficiencies, while it had a high negative impact on the TN and NH4 + -N removal efficiencies. Table 3   summarized the different plants or algae used in the anode of P-BES.   4 Contribution of plant-based bioelectrochemical systems (P-BES) to the SDG The three pillars of sustainable development are economic, environmental, and social. The SDGs were developed to ensure a balance between these three pillars, as summarized in the P-BES case in Fig. 4  . The complete analysis of the direct contribution of the P-BES in achieving the SDGs is presented in Table 4   (The related Targets are shown in Table 5  ). As can be seen from Table 4  that the P-BES is contributing positively to all SDGs. The main contribution is on SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). The P-BES significant contribution is energy and wastewater treatment, which directly contributes to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Fig. 5   shows the research collaboration within the P-BES area based on the papers published in the last five years. This collaboration is directly supporting SDG 17 (Partnerships to achieve the Goal). From Fig. 5 , it can be noticed that most of the research was done in the USA and China. VOSviewer was used to extract the results [132] . VOSviewer uses artificial intelligence and text mining to generate this figure. Fig. 6   shows the general relationship between the most related SDGs to P-BES, i.e., SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) in China. An open-source tool, namely SDG Interlinkages [133]  was used. China was selected because the highest P-BES research came from China, as shown in Fig. 5 . Fig. 6  shows the general linkage without looking to a specific industry. As it can be noticed from the figure that SDG 6 and SDG 7 have positive and negative contributions to other SDGs. As an example, there is a synergy relationship between SDG 7 and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being). This relationship happened mainly due to the linear relationship between energy availability growth and economic development, which improve the quality of life [134] . By contrast, this energy growth triggered many health issues. This explains the trade-off relation between SDG 7 and SDG 3 [135] . On the other hand, it can be noticed that increasing renewable energy, which is linked to Target 7.2 “substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix”, it does not always have a synergy (positive) relationship with other SDGs. The appearance of the Targets 6.3 and 6.4 separately from the other related SDGs indicated that there is no relation between them and the other targets based on the used methodology [133] . However, this might not be the case in another region.  5 Challenges and motivations Choosing plants in BESs broadly depends on the availability of the plants, application, and weather. It is important to realize how the density of the plants and installation position will affect the system's performance. The power output from P-BES still very low; therefore, more work has to be done to optimize the cell configuration, the distance between the electrodes, and investigating cheap cathode catalysts such as nitrogen-doped graphene and other nano carbonaceous materials, i.e., carbon nanotube, carbon nanofiber,….etc. High and steady power output is also a critical request to transfer P-BES to the application stage. Furthermore, proper selection of electrode materials with high surface area, good electrical conductivity, biocompatible, inexpensive, and have high chemical and physical stabilities is an important target to realize the commercial application of P-BES. Plants that sustain the severe environmental condition with richly root biomass are also highly recommended. More work should be accomplished to study P-BESs under long-term operation, comprising how the electrode material changed over time, and how the temperature difference during the day or season to season affects the rhizosphere activity microorganisms. More research should be done to study the deterioration rate of P-BES with and without hybridization with phytoremediation. Properties and vitality also identify the environmental impacts of such systems.  6 Conclusions In P-BESs systems, the soil's microorganisms around the plant roots use the plant's root exudates to generate bioelectricity. The P-BES performance depends on the type of plant, type and intensity of the light, temperature, type of microorganisms, the configuration of the system, and the electrode material. This system could generate electricity simultaneously with pollutants removal. The implementation of P-BES in sediment, rice paddy, and phytoremediation was thoroughly discussed. The power generation, COD removal, and pollutant removal are higher in the planted MFC than the unplanted ones or phytoremediation only. Artificial intelligence using VOS viewer was also used to determine the SDGs of the P-BESs. Accordingly, more than 3000 papers were published in the last five years in the plant-based BESs, demonstrating that P-BESs are considered a favorable renewable energy source that can help realize the SDGs. P-BES is one of the promising methods that can help in achieving the SDGs. The P-BES can contribute positively to SDGs, particularly SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). One of the main contributions of P-BES into SDGs, besides a source of renewable energy, is providing a new source of income for smallholders. Providing this income is enormous benefits for eradicating extreme poverty, SDG 1 (No Poverty). The other significant role of P-BES in SDGs is cleaning hazardous materials and removing the wastes, SDG 15 (Life on Land).
