                  The paper reviews recent theoretical discussions on education for sustainable development and competence based teaching, and relates them to the international policy processes of the Sustainable Development Goals implementation where ‘the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development’ are expressed in the SDG 4.7. It shows the importance of the public debate for fostering shared understanding and acceptance of strategies for educational change within the ongoing development of Agenda 2030 at national level. The participatory involvement of multiple actors on different levels is widely recognized as a pre-requisite for consensus on long term goals, but in the Czech Republic, lack of public discussion was identified as an obstacle to deep transformation of the educational system and its reorientation towards ESD. The case study presented in this article describes participatory research conducted to reflect and support the activities of the multiple Czech actors who developed a joint Vision for education that emphasizes competences for sustainability and active citizenship. To draft the Vision and receive formative feedback on its content and wording, participatory processes were organized in several stages: an expert panel developed the first version of the document which was then consulted with representatives of other social actors in focus groups and on future search conference. Next, an overview of actors' views, preferences concerning the Vision content, and the perceived opportunities for and barriers to educational change was collected through an online survey with more than 160 respondents. This generated data for reflection of different views, and quantitative analysis of the actors' expressed preferences. Results highlighted the differences in the actors' focus and particular interests, but also showed a balance in these interests between different groups of actors so that in general, the cooperatively drafted Vision proved to be widely acceptable. In the course of this participative research, in-depth discussion with a number of civic society representatives was initiated, their specific viewpoints were confronted and critically evaluated, and new concepts of the Czech educational system discussed. The fact that the arguments were developed jointly guaranteed a common understanding across a wide range of backgrounds thus facilitating the integration of the Vision in policy debates. This method of participatory research is thus an example of sustainability science which strives for social impact in addition to scientific impact.

The paper reviews recent theoretical discussions on education for sustainable development and competence based teaching, and relates them to the international policy processes of the Sustainable Development Goals implementation where ‘the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development’ are expressed in the SDG 4.7. It shows the importance of the public debate for fostering shared understanding and acceptance of strategies for educational change within the ongoing development of Agenda 2030 at national level. The participatory involvement of multiple actors on different levels is widely recognized as a pre-requisite for consensus on long term goals, but in the Czech Republic, lack of public discussion was identified as an obstacle to deep transformation of the educational system and its reorientation towards ESD. The case study presented in this article describes participatory research conducted to reflect and support the activities of the multiple Czech actors who developed a joint Vision for education that emphasizes competences for sustainability and active citizenship. To draft the Vision and receive formative feedback on its content and wording, participatory processes were organized in several stages: an expert panel developed the first version of the document which was then consulted with representatives of other social actors in focus groups and on future search conference. Next, an overview of actors' views, preferences concerning the Vision content, and the perceived opportunities for and barriers to educational change was collected through an online survey with more than 160 respondents. This generated data for reflection of different views, and quantitative analysis of the actors' expressed preferences. Results highlighted the differences in the actors' focus and particular interests, but also showed a balance in these interests between different groups of actors so that in general, the cooperatively drafted Vision proved to be widely acceptable. In the course of this participative research, in-depth discussion with a number of civic society representatives was initiated, their specific viewpoints were confronted and critically evaluated, and new concepts of the Czech educational system discussed. The fact that the arguments were developed jointly guaranteed a common understanding across a wide range of backgrounds thus facilitating the integration of the Vision in policy debates. This method of participatory research is thus an example of sustainability science which strives for social impact in addition to scientific impact.

This ambitious international strategy is expected to have a considerable impact on national policies, and individual countries are currently rising to this challenge by involving a wide range of social actors in consultation processes that are ongoing in different sectors, including education. As the transformation of our societies resulting from the implementation of the SDGs is expected to influence all sectoral policies and practices within upcoming 15 years (Sachs, 2012 ), this process will require wide social consensus, and the commitment at the level of both individuals and social groups are critical factors of success. Because of the complexity of this conceived profound societal change, and the uncertainty of its success, broad dialogue in society must be recognized as a pre-requisite, and also a result, of these efforts. 1.1 SDGs process The Sustainable Development Goals were developed as a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals and adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015. The UN (2015)  document launched the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which aims to ‘stimulate action over the next 15 years in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet’. Global leaders have unprecedentedly agreed upon this common strategy to improve our world while also national efforts and available resources have been mobilized to fulfil this ambitious agenda. Education plays a prominent role in this framework: of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets, education is covered by one goal (number 4 - Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all) and its 10 targets; it is also mentioned three times within other goals (in areas: 3.7 – health and well-being, 8.6 - sustainable economic growth; 13.3 - action to combat climate change) but implicitly present to a much greater extent (UN, 2015 ). ESD is thus recognized as an ‘integral element of quality education and a key enabler for sustainable development’ (UN-DESA, 2017 ); the interdependence between quality criteria and ESD has been highlighted in several other studies (Kadji-Beltran et al., 2016; Mochizuki and Fadeeva, 2010; UE4SD, 2015 ). To efficiently implement Agenda 2030 in the field of education, independent monitoring and reporting on education in all SDGs for the next fifteen years has been outlined within the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report (UNESCO, 2016 ). These documents also clearly state that to accomplish the SDGs, Global Partnership is needed, ‘bring[ing] together Governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors’ (UN, 2015 ). Partnership  is an inherent component of Agenda 2030 (one of the five Ps outlined in its preamble), and one of its overarching principles. On national level, partnership is important especially at implementation phase which should ‘draw on contributions from indigenous peoples, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders, in line with national circumstances, policies and priorities’ (UN, 2015 ). It is thus evident that the national processes of SDG implementation must rely on the capacities and responsibilities of diverse social actors.  1.2 Educational transformation for SD The role of education in the context of sustainable development was discussed intensely within the UNESCO Decade for Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) and in its follow-up programs. Politicians and academics finally concluded that this new, environmentally friendly and sustainable concept of social progress will require the systemic transformation of our societies, where education is seen as a subject of the change, and is an important driving force. The history of sustainability efforts shows that bottom-up processes  in particular play an important role, and thus continuously evolve: the policy framework is still more decentralized, counting on the awareness of each individual and commitment in his/her specific field of responsibility. This is traceable back to the 1992 World Conference on Rio where Agenda 21 was adopted, to Rio +20 WSSD held in 2012, where broad consultation with all societal ‘Major groups’ took place that lead to the first draft of the Sustainable Development Goals. A similar paradigmatic shift also takes place on behavioural level – from environmental activism, accompanied by the regulation of human activities with respect to environmental limits, to a much more empowered, conscious citizenship prioritizing the capacity of people to develop innovative solutions in the field of technology, renewable energy, green economy and commitment to a non-consumption lifestyle. In the course of these processes, it has been widely acknowledged that to achieve sustainable societies, individuals and communities should themselves bear responsibility for their life, social environment and planet, and to this end they need relevant skills in managing and decision-making. It is assumed that everyone can have an impact on policies on different levels; and citizens should thus be educated in a way that develops their potential to be creative, self-confident, and to engage in a participatory way with society. The relevant skills and competences, rather than pure knowledge, have become priority educational goals, drawing on constructivist pedagogy as the most appropriate tool to attain them (Jacobi et al., 2016 ). The role of competences has been recognized in supporting and empowering educators to fulfil their potential (UNECE, 2011, 2016 ), and hence in contributing to bottom-up driven curriculum changes towards sustainability. Discussion on the ESD competences is being held in the context of higher education (Lambrechts et al., 2013; Rieckmann, 2012; Wiek et al., 2011 ), and illustrated by examples of good practice in 53 higher education programs from 33 countries across Europe (Mulà et al., 2017 ; Dlouhá et al., 2017b, (in press); UE4SD, 2014, 2015 ) where competence oriented approaches in teaching were consequently identified as one of the critical factors  of the transformation towards ESD (Dlouhá et al., 2017a ).  1.3 Vision and competences – factors of educational transformation That the key skills  concept has a potential to induce changes on lower levels of educational systems has been demonstrated already by Rychen and Salganik (2003) : e.g. in Austria (real-life orientation, instead of overspecialisation) or Belgium (highlighting critical and creative development of self and society). Since then, competences are considered to be an organizing principle of learning in schools, instead of subject matter. Based on this assumption, competences are often explicitly articulated as core educational goals, and associated with education that anticipates integrated knowledge (e.g. in Nordic countries, Germany and New Zealand). Different accents are placed on the competence-based education in various national contexts: the close relationship of competences with ethics and the world of complexity (Sweden), skills for reflection of the learning process and hence lifelong learning (Finland), supporting students' ability to actively participate in a democratic society (Denmark), or enhancing individual development and social participation (Germany) – in general, stressing a vision of holistic education that aims to achieve humanistic goals and plays a crucial role in social renewal (Rychen and Salganik, 2003 ). Similar holistic and a socially engaged  vision of educational system that meets global challenges and counterweights ‘dominant economic ideology’ (Delors, 1996, 2013 ) contributed to the formulation of competences that enable teachers to effectively engage with ESD, taking into account ESD principles (Tilbury and Mulà, 2009 ). This is the framework for educational change used in this article, as opposed to conceptualising education as instrumental in raising competitiveness (USA), or to catalyse employability and engagement in the current economic system. In this perspective, interactions of the educational systems with society and variety of actors (community, experts, local governments etc.) play a role in knowledge co-creation. Systemic change towards competence oriented teaching is however still in its initial phases especially under Czech conditions, as it requires substantial transformation of the whole education system: goals, learning processes, assessment principles, and learning environments, and relationships and hierarchies of actors (cf. Dlouhá and Dlouhý, 2014 ) which often is not accepted by teachers and wider educational community (Štech, 2013 ).  1.4 Participation in education reform In the face of a broad spectrum of contemporary development problems and sustainability concerns, demands on educational systems are growing. To respond more effectively to the political, economic and environmental challenges of human development, reflect the changing demands of society and meet the requirements of educational actors, (for instance parents), educational systems and processes need to be more flexible and non-formal by nature. But as Shaeffer (1994)  argues, this inevitable change faces (mainly bureaucratic) difficulties, and the reform efforts thus ‘must at least in part be based upon broader partnerships and more participatory development processes’. In the ‘Collaborating for educational change’ programme described by the authors, numerous cases around the world are presented where diverse stakeholders influence educational innovation in all areas of school activities, including the content of education and the instructional process employed to deliver it. They participate in different stages of the education development processes, such as problem definition, articulating priorities and setting goals, and delivering, evaluating and designing more concrete follow-up programmes and activities. Measured on the ‘ladder of participation’ (a tool originating in an urban planning context (Arnstein, 1969 ) and adapted to the educational environment) their involvement ranged from the receptive use of [educational] services (on the first rung of the ladder) to engaged participation ‘in real decision-making at every stage’ (on the seventh and top rung of the ladder). Such in-depth participation usually necessitates the restructuring of the educational system, leading to significant changes in patterns of (school) governance, and change of educational culture as a whole. It instigates new norms and customs (such as greater social autonomy on systemic level or openness to the outside world), challenges hierarchies (reducing rigidity and bureaucracy, supporting bottom-up planning), but also empowers all its actors, requiring the development of certain professional qualities (competences). This is critical as for change to be really systemic, it must ‘integrate non-school factors … as well as school factors known to make a difference’ (Fullan, 2009 , p. 111).   2 Method Research described in this article was closely associated with public debate to initiate a more substantial transformation of the Czech educational system and policies in context of implementing the SDGs. This debate was facilitated in order to develop a shared concept of education for the future – a long term vision that sets the direction for student learning to ensure acquisition of competences necessary for active citizenship, a concept acutely absent in the Czech context. In this case, an example of participatory processes1  1 “Between 2004 and 2007 more than 15 000 students, teachers, principals, advisers, and academics contributed to developing the draft New Zealand curriculum, building on the recommendations from the New Zealand Curriculum Stocktake Report , published in April 2003. ‘People contributed by participating in working groups, providing input online, or taking part in focus groups. The draft revision of the curriculum was enriched by the knowledge, experience, and different perspectives of all those involved. The participatory process also led to the creation or growth of professional communities and the forging of new connections between groups.’ Source: http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/Archives/Curriculum-project-archives/Developing-the-draft    The resulting New Zealand curricular document is based on ‘the visions of young people who will develop the competencies they need for studying, working, and lifelong learning and for realising their potential’ (MoE NZ, 2007 ).   to develop a new school curriculum in New Zealand (MoE NZ, 2007 ) served as inspiration for CR. Under Czech circumstances, a similar goal to develop a widely acceptable curricular document was supported by efforts to outline a relevant strategy with the real potential to impact on educational policies and practices. In order to involve educational actors in debate and receive formative, and in later stages also summative feedback on the ongoing deliberation processes, the authors conducted participatory research (PR) in which Czech educational actors played a role. PR is in many aspects similar to action research but has a more robust political subtext (Cohen et al., 2013 ). It is used in different contexts to build (upon) community and stakeholder capacity and facilitate debate that identifies challenges and potential solutions. PR is often employed with marginalised communities/actors and has three interwoven goals: social investigation with community/actors participation throughout the entire research process; actions necessary for development and change; and related educational processes/social learning opportunities to mobilize capacities and increase human/social capital in the community (Cohen et al., 2013 ). PR thus promotes both understanding and change: the inquiry itself has an impact on the social system under study and fosters a sense of ‘ownership’ of initiatives, contributing to the empowerment of individuals and social groups (Lennie and Hearn, 2003 ). Adhering to these general principles, different PR methods are used in different contexts, for example in public health research to address health disparities in disempowered communities (Sandoval et al., 2012 ) or in sustainable land management to combine local knowledge – that is sensitive to local perspectives and contexts – with scientific knowledge (Reed et al., 2008 ). In the field of education, this approach plays an important role in the context of ‘critical theory, transformative action and empowerment put into practice’ (Cohen et al., 2013 ). 2.1 Principles and questions applied in this research Participatory research fuels ‘co-generation of knowledge … drawing on multiple understandings in an ongoing collective dialogue in order to transform practice’ (Blackstock et al., 2007 ). In the case described below, the diverse perceptions and experiences of the actors were examined to better understand these processes of knowledge co-generation, communication, translation and mediation. Qualitative methods were used as they can illustrate and make visible ongoing (transformation) processes and illuminate hidden, context-specific aspects of empirical reality such as the variety of stakeholders' views. To assess the relationships in question, quantitative methods are considered inappropriate (Blackstock et al., 2007 ) and the authors used them only in the final research stage to validate the results of the previous stages. The applied research process could be characterized, due to its relatively spontaneous nature, as ‘iterative, inductive analysis’ where new research themes emerge from the findings already obtained: thus the research design was regularly audited (cf. Blackstock et al., 2007 ). The research was ‘development driven’ (focused on objectives in practice of sustainable development) rather than ‘research driven’ (the main aim of which is to advance research objectives) (Martin and Sherington, 1997 ; In: Blackstock et al., 2007 ). To lend credibility to the results, ‘insider understanding’ and an ‘external view’ were combined – the research team invited the involvement of both a protagonist of the process and an external expert. All three PR goals outlined by Cohen et al. (2013)  were covered: (i) mutual respect and a critical debate between stakeholders (facilitated at public discussion events) was underpinned with (theoretical analysis of) the ongoing processes and arguments used to fortify particular views; (ii) social learning between actors with different worldviews was initiated in the process of negotiation; and (iii) through public presentation of the results, policymakers and general public were informed to support its future implementation. As the primary goal of this research was to encourage desirable changes related to SDGs in the Czech educational system and relevant policies, discussions among several educational actors were facilitated freely and organically in the initial stages. The following research questions gradually emerged within these debates: What, according to the main educational actors, are the priorities to be achieved through formal education? and What are their specific educational visions and what assumptions do they share? These questions generated numerous sub-questions, such as – Can the applied participatory method help in the formulation of a widely acceptable document? and What are the perceived main deficiencies of the Czech educational system? or What is associated with good education by different target groups?  2.2 Steps The starting point for this participatory research was connected with the establishment of a broad coalition of NGOs in 2014; consequently an expert panel (Popper, 2008 ) was initiated where some of the key Czech ESD actors met regularly throughout 2015 to formulate a joint position and develop the principles of ‘education for the 21st century'. The process of discussions within the expert panel and beyond, with other actors in civic society, was led by the first author of this article; reflection and analysis throughout the process and culminating at the close of 2015 was mainly organized by the second author who developed the method, survey, and worked with the data. The analysis at this stage exploited qualitative and consequently quantitative data. The qualitative part was based on an input from the expert panel, and feedback from focus groups organized with specific target groups/educational actors; quantitative data were collected from a self-administered online questionnaire. Due to the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, new concepts not yet described in the literature could be developed and tested as regards their strength – and to what degree there was commonality in understanding of these concepts among different target groups. Using different sources of data (expert based and from actors’ responses) allowed to take into the consideration of different views. The methods used corresponded with research aims – focus on a wide spectrum of actors who were provided with the opportunity to formulate their opinions without interference or influence of the vision of the expert panel. Discussions were closely interrelated with the governmental process of the Agenda 2030 strategy for development in the educational field as several members of the expert panel were involved in the Committee for Education of the Government Council for SD. 2.2.1 Exploring the context Brief overview of recent policy environment, SDG related initiatives by the government, and activities realized by NGOs and other actors was drawn through desk-top research, while experiences of the expert panel members in national policy debates helped to navigate the search. Review of existing educational concepts relevant for ESD and the global citizenship education was also a part of the research. Some of the resources were produced and/or shared by the wide spectrum of civic society organizations, which involved mainly environmental, development, and other organizations with educational focus, higher education institutions and also representatives of the Czech government.  2.2.2 Participatory formulation of the Vision Participatory research started with establishment of the open expert panel  where mainly academics and NGOs (see legend to Table 1  ) met to discuss the perceived shortages of the current educational system; to depict desired characteristics of the ‘ideal global citizen’ for the contemporary world; and to identify relevant competences for his/her development. These discussions were organized into five intense half-day meetings which were attended by the core group and other irregular participants. The nominal group technique  (Bammer et al., 2009 ) and Socratic questioning  (Nussbaum, 2002 ) were used to generate the ideas and develop consensus while also critically reflecting on widely accepted educational concepts and assumptions. Including the preparatory work, this process lasted half year to produce the mutually acceptable document; in-depth debate and respectful negotiations paid off in mutual understanding and close relationships among the participants at the end of this period. The resulting draft Vision  that included 4 domains and desired learner's characteristics in each of them was introduced to and discussed with other social actors on a number of other occasions; its consequent analysis was the subject of the following stages.  2.2.3 Mixed methods used to involve a spectrum of actors After being agreed upon by the expert panel, the draft educational Vision was opened for wider discussion with the general public. This stage included organization of several debates, focus groups  (Billson, 2006 ) and the national future search conference  (Bammer et al., 2009 ) in June 2015; the outcomes of these discussions were reflected by the expert panel in the continuous improvement of the document. Two focus groups were organized with specific actors: university students from humanities and teacher education students (future teachers). Typically, each focus group started by outlining a broader context of sustainable development and development issues, followed by a depiction of the role of education within desirable change processes. Participants' own ideas, visions and opinions regarding the Czech educational system were collected, and the draft Vision was introduced; subsequently, the importance of the Vision domains and their specific learners' characteristics were questioned, while the possibilities of its application in specific educational settings were also discussed. The debates had a similar format of inquiry but were adjusted according to the circumstances and always designed to elicit inputs from participants based on their knowledge and practice. Systemic qualitative analysis was applied in one case: after a lecture on the challenges in the educational field, written opinions on the Czech system's transition were collected from 40 humanities students. These responses were coded according the Vision domains, and assessed in the order of the respondent's preference on a 5 point Likert scale, (from highly important, to negative attitude) towards the concerned domain. The summary calculated point distribution which characterized what students considered as significant. The future search conference  was planned in order to introduce and reflect on the draft Vision of education for the 21st century in the context of the SDGs; discuss the concept and desired outcomes of education in the Czech Republic; map the views of different actors, particularly the business community, on the current education system in terms of its perceived benefits, drawbacks, specific needs and requirements – and also to open new spaces for intense dialogue and cooperation between different actors. One of the discussion themes was the possibility of using the Vision directly for setting educational goals at different levels of education, and possibly also as a framework in strategic educational planning. The roundtable panel and plenary session (morning) and small groups discussion (afternoon) gave a forum for outlining a realistic conception of desirable changes in education; common needs/deficiencies as well as to identify opportunities/barriers for action.  2.2.4 Reflection of the draft Vision by actors through the online questionnaire While previous stages provided mainly formative feedback, this stage was designed to evaluate satisfaction with the draft Vision across wide range of actors. As quantitative analysis was planned at this point, the online questionnaire was distributed and shared among NGOs and other actors involved in education – teachers, students, parents etc. (several networks used their mailing lists to ensure wide dissemination of the survey). This questionnaire was designed to let the respondents 1) express their own opinion on the education in CR: its main deficiencies and ways in which it could be improved; 2) reflect on the presented Vision, and provide feedback on their preferences regarding its main domains, and specific goals/learner's characteristics in each of domain. These two parts of the questionnaire were distinct, so that the respondents were confronted with the Vision draft only after they expressed their own opinion on the deficiencies/areas for improvement of the Czech education. Thus, respondents' original point of view was depicted, and its compliance with the offered Vision consequently tested. The sample of respondents was non representative (this fact is reflected in the interpretation of the results), and was aimed at capturing insight into differences of opinion among the selected target groups. Therefore, the questionnaire included both open-ended and close-ended questions to reflect interconnections between the answers and respondents' understandings underlying them. Open-ended questions focused on the respondent's own vision of education and desired key competences as outcomes of the learning processes, and their opinions on strengths and weaknesses of the Czech educational system. The strength of open-ended questions lies in the lack of limitation by a predetermined set of possible answers. In closed-ended questions, respondents evaluated the adequacy and significance of particular learner's characteristics described in the Vision. The open-ended questions were analysed through two types of analysis – code-based, and word analysis (Jackson and Trochim, 2002 ). In code-based analysis, the answers to the particular questions, and the topics that emerged in its interpretation, were first carefully considered. In the second step, the thematic categories (codes) for different themes found in the first step were developed while attention was paid to the codes illustrating different perspectives on participants' shared rules and norms as well as being relevant to their general opinions and attitudes towards education (Bogdan and Biklen, 1992 ). Each response was then assigned codes (one or more) and the relationships among codes were examined to identify patterns and trends. Thus the results were not only a list of codes (thematic categories) and their frequencies but also a complex picture of possible answers and relationships among them. To show the scope of different words used to describe draft Vision dimensions, the results were consequently depicted also in word clouds. Answers from closed-ended questions were analysed both for the whole sample and per specific groups of actors. This analysis focused on the adequacy of the constructed draft Vision and on respondents' understanding of learner's characteristics and ideas included in it. Thus not only the quality and wider acceptability of the document developed by a few actors in the expert panel was tested, but also input to further develop the draft Vision was elicited (with the aim to broaden or specify it accordingly). Due to the fact that the sample of respondents did not provide representative data, the results of analysis were summarized in second and third grade contingency tables and graphs – they cannot show probability of trends in the whole population but are useful for depicting emerging topics and possible ways of understanding; in this specific case they illustrated values of different actor groups.  2.2.5 Role of the results in practice Within the undertaken participatory research, results based both on expert knowledge and voices of actors and interest groups involved in education were obtained so that the outcome could be used for informed decision-making. These results were interpreted and generalized in the last research stage in order to develop input into the government strategies on ESD, while also the educational Vision played a role in practice for some of the involved actors (for example at the Labyrinth School, Brno, which is a part of the Open School Space project).    3 Findings As apparent from the previous section, a variety of methods was applied in this research to gain a consistent reflection on the educational Vision which had been drafted in a participatory way by actors in education in the CR. 3.1 Exploring the context: debates on educational transformation in CR The most influential Czech education policy document – the National Education Program (White Book on Education  (Greger and Walterová, 2007 )) – was inspired by the Delors' (1996)  concept of learning for the 21st century. It outlined long-term goals for the development of society based on education where knowledge, competences, attitudes and values are all given equal weight in the curriculum, thus triggering transformative processes within the educational system. In practice, this assumption led to the development of the Framework Educational Programmes  (one of the most influential Czech curricular documents) that provide a basis for active, e.g. project based learning, as well as cross-curricular integration, and which helped to introduce new themes such as the environment and global justice. Calls for more substantial changes were raised e.g. within discussions on the ESD Strategy that resulted in its approval by the Czech Government (in force 2008-2015; a new, more comprehensive version was negotiated for the period 2016–2025); New concepts have also been developed within global education (Klicperová-Baker, 2008 ) that supported the National Strategy of Global Education 2011–2015. These concepts were reflected in the recently published Educational Strategy 2020 which focuses on education as a factor for individual and societal well-being, emphasising values and culture, and active citizenship that is a pre-requisite of democracy (thus going beyond the goal of employability among students). In spite of these formal commitments, education policy in the Czech Republic remains based on traditional values (cf. Štech, 2013 ), it emphasizes the importance of obtaining knowledge, while systemic discussions on a holistic educational Vision and necessary innovations for transformation are lacking. This challenge was addressed within the policy agenda that was raised on governmental, as well as civic society level in 2014 in the process of formulating the Czech version of SDGs. In this context, two parallel processes have been at work: 1) development of the Government SD Strategy Framework and Agenda 2030 that are relevant for SDGs implementation (these documents were prepared by the Government Office to be ready by the end of the 2016); and 2) a parallel, shadow NGO process that contributed to the formal process in a participatory way by involving environmental, global, civic rights and other non-governmental organizations. Although the Government process was much better organized (and financially supported), this article describes the informal process in which many societal actors with an interest and/or expertise in education played a role. To support these processes, a common platform existed within the Committee for Education of the Government Council for SD where multiple perspectives of educational stakeholders were discussed. Such a broad involvement of actors, and the government's willingness to respectfully listen to their opinions was a breakthrough in the participatory policies in the Czech Republic. Up until now, these processes existed but were vulnerable to political interests of the relevant ministries (of education, and of the environment) – in spite of the fact that a tradition of public participation was strengthened from 1990 and civic society representatives took the role of independent experts in many social conflicts (Čada and Ptáčková, 2013 ). In the process of recent deliberation, the actors worked with the results from previous research in the field (Disterheft et al., 2015; Holm et al., 2015; Ramos et al., 2014 ), and relevant curricular, policy and other documents (Daniš, 2013; MoE NZ, 2007 ).  3.2 Dialogue The original aim of the expert panel was to draft a list of key competences : desirable learning outcomes in the environmental, sustainability and development field (civic education). In the course of discussions (and based on experiences) with other international competence oriented projects (Rychen and Salganik, 2001 ) it became clear that certain competences are often context specific and relevant to a particular target group and educational program. Moreover, in practice they are considered to be ‘learnable but not teachable’ (Weinert, 2001 ), and very difficult to assess – acceptance of such competences in the Czech educational system was problematic (cf. Štech, 2013 ). To establish a common viewpoint, and inspired by the New Zealand Curriculum (MoE NZ, 2007 ), attention was shifted to work on a joint Vision . This was developed in a holistic manner (as expressed in the preamble2  2 Preamble: ‘Our vision is a society where all people live a dignified life in accordance with their wishes, in harmony with others and with respect to the Earth. We therefore want education to help us relate to the world in a way which is confident, open, grounded and engaged.’  ), and specific learner's characteristics – the basis for development of the competences desirable for civic engagement – were formulated in its four domains, as summarized in Table 1 .  3.3 Results from the public discussion The Vision was discussed further with different groups of educational actors to collect formative feedback. Students, Faculty of Humanities   – these university students expressed their reaction to the learners' characteristics in open ended questions which were coded according to the Vision domains and assessed on a 5 point Likert scale (−1: against the concept; 1: no interest; 4: most interested). As shows Fig. 1  , they were most interested in the Self-Confident domain. Students' responses to the open ended questions expressed the following opinions, among others:‘Self-confidence must be supported, but in a ‘healthy’ way: it should be based on real knowledge and skills.’   ‘Education should stress students’ own paths and interests, support self-directed learning, and show opportunities. School should be a place of inspiration. Ethics is notably missing.’    Students, Pedagogical Faculty Prague   (focus group related to the course: Education for shared responsibility ), 04 2015, 20 participants. Discussion with students was summarized as follows:• Grounded domain is problematic (too binding, not related to other competences)  • Self-confident domain is perceived as ‘healthy’ (but students' confidence should be somehow limited)  • Open domain is relevant for the concept of education as an inquiry (students ‘enjoy’ exploring the World)  • Engaged domain was approved of but the need for responsibility was emphasised!    In general, the Vision was received positively; its purpose was perceived as useful for communication with the lay public (according to these students it was not suitable for experts as more specific goals and competences have already been outlined in the Framework educational programs). As such, this provides a useful basis for discussion with parents. The students felt that competences related to tolerance  and the ability to develop and express one's own arguments  were missing. Responsibility  for decisions was perceived as crucial. Environmental and development NGOs   (Pavučina, People in Need etc.), 04 2015: on different occasions, discussions were held with NGO representatives. Experience with environmentally oriented organizations' representatives in particular showed that qualities they felt to be lacking in the Vision included modesty , responsibility , and humbleness ; they also considered (competences in) the grounded  domain to be too passive, and those in engaged  too entrepreneurial. ‘Future search conference’ for businesses and other actors   was organized within the Czech annual Sustainable Development Week (06 2015); participants from a wide range of educational contexts in general agreed that the Czech educational system lacks vision, and public discussion is often missing and/or the results of discussions are not implemented; educational policies in general do not have a complex, systemic character; its administration is inefficient, and the Czech system is relatively conservative in the European context, lagging behind according to some indicators.  3.4 Results of the online survey The quantitative part of this research worked with the data from an online self-administered questionnaire distributed at the end of 2015/beginning of 2016 among a number of target groups (teachers, students, parents, policy-makers, business representatives, NGOs etc.). It was answered by more than 160 respondents; the sample was comprised 64% of women and 36% men; respondents were between 18 and 88 years old (the average was 42 years both for women and men), and 68% of them had their own children. Different actor groups were represented as follows3  3 Respondents could choose more than one category – this percentage is counted from the respondents' first choice. This first choice was considered as most significant for their perception of the questioned issues.   – 32% of teachers, 22% NGOs, 17% parents, 15% students, 14% others. Because participation was based on self-selection, this sample was not representative, yet its composition corresponds quite well with the structure of those involved in the learning process at different education levels (for example more women in the target group of primary/secondary school teachers, more men in university teachers group etc.). The questionnaire first focused on the respondents' vision of good education, and subsequently they evaluated the draft Vision. Analysis of the answers to the first open-ended question – which required generating spontaneous thoughts and opinions on education, not influenced by the expert Vision – referred to the perceived problems of the contemporary Czech education system. Because of the exploratory character of the research aim, grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967 ) was used for analysis, open coding in particular. The problems raised in the answers were coded into ten categories which emerged from the data (administrative, financial, political, societal, content of education, quality of education, teachers, students, parents and no problems). Those categories were merged into four umbrella categories through axial coding (Strauss and Corbin, 1998 ) – problems on macro , meso , micro  level, and others  (these categories relate to different levels of decision making). Table 2   shows examples of the problems identified by respondents in three of these categories. The most often mentioned problems related to the content  or form of education . Respondents reflected mostly on the macro and meso level of the problems, and some of the problems were described on more than one levels (e.g. inadequate recognition of the teaching profession and hence also their performance). The claims in each of the categories can be illustrated by the answers to the question: What are the biggest problems of contemporary education in your opinion ? On macro level the responses pointed to ‘frequent changes in the Education Act and executive regulations’  while there is also ‘lack of communication from the Ministry of Education to teachers’ . On meso level the concern was that ‘school requires learning by rote, not thinking’  and ‘the whole educational concept is out of date, suitable for 30 years ago’ . Individual responses however indicated that there might be some overarching scepticism concerning the educational system, including individual empowerment: it was mentioned that there is a ‘lack of authority – teachers don't know how to motivate and retain student's attention’ , there is also ‘lack of motivation – students don't know why to learn, what for’ , and also ‘parents don't support teachers' . Perceptions of the Vision were measured by ranking each of the domains and goals/learners' characteristics within them, the results of which are summarized in Fig. 2   which shows the importance attributed to the four domains perceived by the whole sample of respondents. The responses reflect the specific nature of each actor's opinions. As we can see, openness  is valued as the most important Vision domain in general, and also from the point of view of most of the actors (teachers and other). Teachers didn't perceive engagedness  and self-confidence  as that important. The explanation could be found in the open ended questions – teachers sometimes equate self-confidence  with imprudence or disobedience. Open  students, on the other hand, are considered to be those with whom it is easiest and most enjoyable to work. Engagedeness  was perceived as the least appreciated domain, probably due to the cultural environment rather than to the character of individual actors. It was considered as the least important also by NGOs. As expected, self-confidence  was a priority also for the students and parents; possibly connected with their ambitions and single-mindedness. Due to the methodology which used both open and close-ended questions, the consistency of the draft Vision from respondents' point of view could be reflected. In the questionnaire, they were first asked to express, in their own words (in open-ended question), their opinion on which characteristics should be fostered most among learners. Only after this has been completed were they asked to evaluate the proposed Vision. The answers from this open-ended question were compared with the draft Vision; it was concluded that they correspond to the four domains proposed in the Vision, but shift slightly the content of each of them. Differences are shown in word clouds below. Word cloud is a visual representation of text, it illustrates relative frequency of words in answers through the size of the word in the picture (the bigger, the more frequent). For this purpose, answers were used after analytical cleaning – only significant words related to learners' characteristics in the four draft domains were selected from the text. The form of words was retained as they had been given in the answers, only different words with the same meaning were merged. The following figures represent word clouds for all four domains, translated into English (see Figs. 3–6     ). Word clouds show that in the Grounded  domain, the key topic is life , together with knowledge  and interconnectedness  (here labelled as links ) between things. Someone acquiring competences in the Grounded  domain could be characterized as a student, conscious of and having a clear understanding of the interrelationships between phenomena while his/her knowledge is connected to praxis – as the survey participants expressed: ‘In education it is important to have dexterity and the consciousness that work is an integral part of human life and that it leads to happiness’ . This domain of the draft Vision stresses the concept of the student as a part of the wider environment. The proposed characteristics in the Engaged  domain, diverged most significantly compared to those of other domains from the draft Vision. Characteristics of being active in the community  went almost unmentioned. There was more mention of creativity , communication  and collaboration , i.e. engagement in a collaborative group, but not in a social context: ‘Education should lead not to obedient employees but to active individuals’.  It is interesting that individuality  was considered by respondents as an important feature both for the Engaged  and Self-confident  domain. In the latter, independency  emerged as a key topic, closely followed by individuality , support , develop[ment] , interest , talent  etc.: ‘The educational system should be individualized in the way that it enables a broad scale of the individual's talents.’  This was different from the draft Vision – which accentuates individual progress but with respect to the other people and the social context. The Open  domain was strongly related by respondents to the critical thinking  competence: ‘Most important is the ability of searching and interpreting information and critically assessing the value if the information’ . Empathy, social relationships and respect were also mentioned to a lesser extent. These aspects were almost the same as learners' characteristics in the draft Vision, but expressed in the respondents' own words. Word clouds thus helped not only to illustrate the content of the Vision domains visually, but also to assess the relative importance of the particular aspects/characteristics as perceived by different actors.  3.5 Implementation To ‘translate’ the results of this broad consultation process into the prepared government Sustainable Development Strategy Framework (Czech Agenda 2030 and SDGs implementation document – national SD framework strategy), a round table for ESD was organized for actors involved in the related participatory processes (NGOs and other). In brainstorming with participants, and consequent generalization of the results, the strategic goals and sub-goals were formulated for inclusion in these documents: ‘Take into consideration diverse roles of education, and fulfil them using all the capacities and building upon involvement of major actors in education, towards the jointly formulated, shared educational vision.’  The specific roles of education e.g. in civic education; desirable capacities, e.g. in formal, informal and non-formal education; involvement of major actors incl. civic society organizations; and a shared Vision of education were outlined as sub-goals. These strategic principles have been emphasised in later stages of the consultation process – the document approved by the Czech government at the end of 2016 strongly ‘endorse[s] grassroots initiatives, networking, participation of non-state actors in education’ , and states the necessity to ‘rethink the positivist approach to education while supporting a growing diversity of active and participatory education policies, with a view to promoting future participation of the individual in society in all respects. Such approaches should include in particular the constructivist concept of teaching, and grasping … resilience’  (Government CR, 2016 ). Actors participating in the debates used the Vision also practically, e.g. to outline the basic principles and key values in a school where one participant was a head teacher.4  4 The Vision was used by the Labyrinth School, Brno to illustrate its guiding principles: ‘Labyrinth is based on a framework of values supported by socio - emotional competencies and other competencies key to the 21st century. A solid foundation of values leads to knowledge and ultimately to a confident, secure, open, committed person who has developed a zest for lifelong learning’. See http://labyrinthschool.cz/en/koncept .     4 Discussion To draw a broader picture of (existing pre-requisites for) systemic educational transition, the educational policy environment in the Czech Republic has been explored by different educational actors. Participatory research was organized in order to investigate the possibilities of, and negotiate principles of inevitable actions for educational transformation. From the perspective of deliberative democracy, Czech educational actors are underrepresented in debates on long term goals/systemic changes in this field, and mobilizing their capacities seemed to be inevitable to reach the desired changes in the SDGs context (cf. Cohen et al., 2013 ). In this case, empowerment and development were considered to be ‘both the medium and the outcome of the research’, as referred by Cohen et al. (2013) . Three reasons for active involvement of stakeholders and the public in sustainability research identified by (Blackstock et al., 2007 ) were important in this context: normative (social and individual learning to be encouraged); substantive (multiple perspectives to improve understanding of the issues, and therefore the selection of appropriate solutions); instrumental (collaborative relationships to support implementation). The holistic educational Vision for CR that included desired learner characteristics in four domains (Grounded, Engaged, Self-confident, Open ) was thus formulated in a participatory way. Influential educational actors were questioned through discussions and a survey in order to validate this Vision as a shared framework for competence development, but also engage these actors in the debate and capture differences between the groups. These actors' input enabled the generalization of results (in terms of research), and empowerment of the involved actors (in practice). This is crucial for the Czech Republic where public debate on education does not have a long tradition, which in itself has significantly negative impact on the flexibility of the education system (where changing needs are taken into account only indirectly, via studies and policy documents) and its quality (any dissatisfaction, especially of parents, is channelled into the development of alternative educational paths as opposed to an improvement of the system). The discussed Vision document was simple enough to be understandable by all, while providing sufficient space for different perspectives and approaches to be integrated in this framework. However, the advantage of its universality was a drawback for its practical use: it is necessary to develop strategies for its practical implementation in specific contexts. When confronted with the original source of inspiration from New Zealand (MoE NZ, 2007 ), the four domains (Confident , Connected , Actively involved , Lifelong learners ) differ slightly from the Czech Vision – providing official guidance for teaching and learning in New Zealand schools, the curricular framework is more practically oriented, clearly distinguishing values , competences  and learning areas  with concrete objectives . The New Zealand document was also drafted in a participatory way but the process was organized by the Ministry of Education; the principles  outlined with the vision  were translated into teaching strategies  and approaches, and recommendations to design and review school curriculum , including expected achievements  that ‘amount to deeper learning’. Alongside other educational documents under the New Zealand Educational Act, this document represents framework guidelines to be implemented by each school creatively and according to its needs; and also to be reflected at tertiary level. Both documents include the vision and learners' characteristics to be translated into competences in educational practice – but the Czech document does this only implicitly. When compared with other relevant literature and international documents calling for ESD transformation (Sleurs, 2008; Weinert, 2001 ) the Vision resulting from the Czech debate addresses especially non-cognitive domains of learning. In this respect, especially the affective domain is perceived as most absent in the Czech educational system, and is often included in requirements for its transformation. Thus, stressing the need for a holistic educational concept (combining all domains in the process of learning), the public debate highlighted the importance of competence oriented education, and prepared arguments for its implementation on national level. 4.1 National context In the national context, the action research presented in this article mobilized numerous actors to discuss SDGs and their implementation in the educational field. Bottom-up processes based on broad partnerships are internationally recognized as a pre-requisite for sustainable development in general (UNESCO, 2016 ), and specifically for change of educational policies (Shaeffer, 1994; UN, 2015 ). In the described case, the focus was on one of the cornerstones of the educational reform: competences  relevant for global citizenship. Debates held in the context of this research were highly interactive and brought essential benefits for all involved: from the perspective of the individual, engagement in strategic planning raised also his/her understanding and commitment, so that, from a wider perspective, decision making could be more efficient owing to the higher level of ownership of the resulting policies. The research documented preferences of diverse actors concerning the Vision domains and learner's characteristics within them. The divergence in preference was apparent from the focus groups and future search conference: for example, university students considered the self-confident domain of greatest value while future teachers understood this as potentially contradictory to obedience and hence they favoured openness. The grounded domain was not valued as highly by those who were associated with ESD and global education as by environmental education representatives – this is probably due to the future oriented character of ESD and global education, while embeddedness is emphasised in the environmental point of view. Some of the actors needed reformulation of the Vision into more practical concepts (business representatives) while other considered it relevant but claimed that other learner characteristics were missing (modesty, responsibility, humbleness, ability to develop and communicate one's own arguments). Most of them considered a widely negotiated educational vision as a (currently lacking) need for the CR. In the online survey, the majority of respondents referred to the unsuitable content and form of education ; the second most frequently mentioned problem was related to structural policy issues , the third was the financial situation  in education. From the content point of view, current education lags behind developments in society, is not practical and too individualistic, with little attention paid to new teaching methods that motivate active learning. This low motivation was perceived by both teachers and pupils. The problems were perceived on macro, meso, and micro levels of the educational system, and hence transformation is required to tackle the challenge to refocus the system on competences and address other problems expressed in the survey answers. The results showed that actors' preferences differed but in general, the presented Vision was considered as adequate, with a balanced description of domains and also the desired learner's characteristics within them, and addressing problematic or missing aspects in the educational system. Openness  was perceived as the most important domain while engagement  was given in general the lowest priority for all actors including NGOs, and moreover the desired learner characteristics in this domain were of an individualistic nature, lacking social context. We suppose this to be due to the specifics of Czech history when this term had ideological connotations in the past. Word cloud images depicted open-ended responses showing that the respondents' preconceptions of the desired educational goals were greatly reflected in the draft Vision. The process of formulation of the Vision with the Socratic questioning  method (Nussbaum, 2002 ) was extremely intensive. The expert panel met for five half day meetings in the course of half a year; at these meetings key terms and concepts were discussed in depth. During these debates it became clear that many of the most usual terms and keywords were frequently used up until that point as empty catchphrases; to clarify them it was necessary to 1) contextualize them drawing on the specific experiences of the participants from different educational fields, and 2) generalize them by building on this contextual understanding to negotiate a shared meaning. Moreover, participants realized that translations of the terms from other languages (English) were insufficient – in the Czech context they seemed to be too idealistic, or brought a historical burden (have been used as ideological mantras in the past). As often no other Czech equivalent terms were identified, the expert panel finally decided to ignore this burden and try to enforce the original meaning and significance of the term. In general, this slow negotiation process provided good ground for further discussions. Most of the comments on the Vision from other actors at later stages appeared to be resolved. All the negotiation processes were complex and time consuming (it took time and effort to challenge participants and overcome numerous barriers in understanding); however, the outcome of these discussions – the joint Vision for Education in the Czech Republic – was in the end widely acceptable by diverse actors in the field of education in the CR. The suitability of the draft Vision was confirmed in all feedback activities; and participatory processes generated momentum to develop ideas which will have transformative role in the education system. The resulting document is thus qualified to be used for policy purposes in various areas and on different educational levels. To conclude, participative processes of this nature can produce results relevant for decision-making. They should be developed nationally, with a thorough understanding of the context to draw on and adapt general terms and concepts, but experiences and case study examples could be exploited also in other contexts if appropriately adjusted.  4.2 Research method The conceptual framework of participatory research is based upon the rationale of sustainability science; in the described case it was used to involve multiple actors in active collaboration for educational change (Shaeffer, 1994 ). This approach acknowledges the input of citizens and other stakeholders in ‘…understanding of complex systems to achieve more durable and equitable solutions…’; it helps to reflect ongoing processes in the framework of ‘naturalistic inquiry’ where processes are observed in their normal (non-manipulated) state, and in natural context (Blackstock et al., 2007 ). As it develops under different contexts and with different goals, also a variety of methods is recommended for specific purposes. The research methods used in this case (expert panel, focus groups, future search conference and online survey) as well as communication tools applied here (nominal group technique to overcome potential power relationships, Socratic questioning to challenge participants' assumptions and clarify their different opinions) were designed to stimulate and generate ideas, foster critical discussion, and facilitate a shared result. Analytical methods were applied to support these processes by categorization and comparison of key concepts that emerged in discussion which helped to select and justify the most important arguments. The following factors were important for the research process:• All steps were thoroughly prepared (methods adjusted to the local context) and negotiated in a broader group of actors/NGOs who prepared SDGs relevant policy documents in other fields.  • For the negotiation processes, sufficient time was allocated so that differences in understandings of key terms between participants could be overcome. It was also necessary to follow high ethical standards (openness, mutual respect, equitable designation of time to hear all voices etc.) – the participants should feel comfortable, without suspicion of manipulation for any hidden interests.  • The shared Vision (prepared within the consultation process) was sufficiently brief to serve as a basis for discussions between numerous actors. Its principles (domains and learner's characteristics) were intuitively comprehensible for the lay public but with the potential to be translated into more concrete goals, approaches and educational policies at course, school or national level, including policy proposals for curricular change.  • At all stages of the process, continuous translation between participants' discourses, and interpretation of the general – shared – meaning was a crucial element of mutual understanding. All terms and concepts were understood differently from diverse perspectives of individual actors, and should be thoroughly clarified so as to avoid reliance on meaningless with catchphrases.  • Reflection was constitutive part of the process and provided necessary formative feedback between research steps.    Concrete circumstances and methods of the participatory research, i.e. selection of actors, themes for discussion, format of the meetings, and the overall qualitative research framework are always context specific, requiring a high level of empathy and in-depth review of the policy environment and documents. As the research worked with future visions unknown at the beginning of the analytical process, quantitative methods easily transferrable to other contexts were used minimally and were applied only in the final stage of the research where inquiry was broadened to other (not previously involved) actors as an attempt to evaluate views prevailing in the broader community. Participatory research goals were outlined similarly as Cohen et al. (2013)  to (i) provoke critical debate between stakeholders, and assist clarification/negotiation of particular views in this debate through analytical feedback; (ii) initiate social learning between actors with different worldviews; and (iii) through building ownership and public presentation of the results, anticipate future implementation of the results. In the given timeframe – one year of the project duration – these goals were completed with the development of the agreed and clearly defined Vision, which is one of the important criteria for good PR (Blackstock et al., 2007 ). Any further activities with a similar focus such as engagement of actors in participative (educational) policy development, and analysis of the results of their discussions might creatively use experiences from this case study. They should however count on a much longer time necessary to reach additional criteria, especially legitimacy, representation and recognized impact on educational policies leading to systemic transformation in this field (Blackstock et al., 2007 ). The results obtained in this research were non-representative, and it would be useful to continue with similar research to obtain representative quantitative data (also pointed out by some of the actors during the described events). In this regard, the presented research should be considered as a first step. Further efforts could for example question whether specific visions for specific contexts are needed in order to be more easily implemented in practice. Experiences from the case study documented in this article thus could inspire similar endeavors in practice; however, to be used as a basis for further generalization and/or comparison with similar cases, additional work needs to be done.   5 Conclusion Participation can be considered as an important element of decision making especially within processes of social transformation where prevailing fundamental theories and paradigms are questioned. In this article, the authors describe a concrete participatory process to discuss SDG related transformation of the educational system: a broad strategic debate that was held in the Czech national context, with the involvement of multiple societal actors to achieve practical impact. These processes were designed and facilitated to discuss principles of educational change; participatory research to get feedback and reach consensus provided a framework in which cooperative efforts and their reflection were organized. Discussions held at different occasions usually started on a basic level of understanding, worked with simple terms and concepts, explored different meanings they are given from diverse actors' perspectives, and clarified the existing/desired policy frameworks to design a joint educational Vision that is relevant for active citizenship. On this basis, mutual understanding between actors was gradually established, while their diverse or even conflicting viewpoints were continuously worked with. Different methods – such as expert panel, focus groups, future search conference – were applied to produce relevant outcomes. These dialogical processes were simultaneously combined with analytical ones – reflecting on results of an online survey in particular that obtained data from a number of other actors with an interest in educational transformation to justify the validity of the resulting document. In general, competences are considered to be one of the cornerstones of systemic educational transformation; competences for active citizenship and participation in society were a common demand of important educational actors in CR. To underpin this requirement with arguments, shared educational Vision was developed in the public debate held for the Czech Agenda 2030 preparation, as shown in Fig. 7  . This Vision consists of four domains where desirable characteristics of future learners are outlined. If these characteristics were used as complex educational goals, competence rather than knowledge would be the focus of school curricula. This is a novel approach in the Czech educational system, which often contradicts the prevailing expert view. Analysis of actors' preferences regarding the educational Vision through qualitative methods of inquiry showed, most importantly, that the engaged domain was least appreciated by all of the actors including NGOs, and desired learner's characteristics within it were perceived to be individualistically oriented and lacking social context. When assessed quantitatively, this joint Vision for education in the Czech Republic was generally acceptable to different social actors taking into account their different views. Participatory research methods, of which the presented case is an example, provide necessary evidence to build upon in further endeavours, and in practice support collective capacity of actors necessary for transformation processes on different levels. Outcomes of these processes however still greatly depend on governance mechanisms at local or national level, and benefits of participation thus consist of collective and reflexive learning which raise the capacities of individuals and communities for social change. This highlights the importance of a sustainability framework, that orients scientific as well as practical effort towards a negotiated vision of the future which is not a simple extrapolation of the present state. In this context, science should provide ‘scientific’, i.e. evidence based and reliable expertise to navigate human activities towards normatively set goals. The specific contribution of sustainability science  to the desired social change described in this article assisted the dialogue of different actors which was held with respect to their multiple values and perspectives, and processes of knowledge co-generation where this diverse input played an important role. These multilateral information flows not only increase understanding of complex social systems (in theory) but also support socio-political decision-making in practice.
