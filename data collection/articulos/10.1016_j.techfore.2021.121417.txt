                  As governments, business leaders, and other stakeholders discuss green recovery, this research examines the combined effects of energy poverty, renewable energy consumption, gross domestic product, gross domestic product square, natural gas consumption and trade freedom on CO2 emissions in developing countries during the period 2001–2019. A panel quantile regression is used to examine the heterogeneity of the distribution among various CO2 quantiles. This research contributes to understanding to what extent energy poverty and the other driver variables determine the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7): affordable and clean energy. The results show that energy poverty should be reduced as a priority in developing countries in order to achieve SDG7 and reduce CO2 emissions. Finally, the study reveals several implications for policymakers in the sample countries in order to achieve environmental sustainability by means of renewable energy, economic activity, and trade freedom.

As governments, business leaders, and other stakeholders discuss green recovery, this research examines the combined effects of energy poverty, renewable energy consumption, gross domestic product, gross domestic product square, natural gas consumption and trade freedom on CO2  emissions in developing countries during the period 2001–2019. A panel quantile regression is used to examine the heterogeneity of the distribution among various CO2  quantiles. This research contributes to understanding to what extent energy poverty and the other driver variables determine the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7): affordable and clean energy. The results show that energy poverty should be reduced as a priority in developing countries in order to achieve SDG7 and reduce CO2  emissions. Finally, the study reveals several implications for policymakers in the sample countries in order to achieve environmental sustainability by means of renewable energy, economic activity, and trade freedom.   Keywords Clean energy  Carbon emissions  Low carbon economy  Green recovery  Sustainability  Sustainable development    1 Introduction The UN's seventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG7) aims to provide access to affordable, reliable, efficient and clean energy, and, as a result, achieve the reduction of carbon emissions (CO2 ) (United Nations, 2020 ). The ultimate aim is to achieve a greener and carbon-free economy in the long term, with the use and production of clean energies (Balezentis et al., 2021 ). This aim is based on the alarming degradation of the environment registered in recent decades due to polluting gasses in the atmosphere (Munir et al., 2020 ; Shahbaz et al., 2017 ) and high primary energy intensity (US Stats, 2021). This degradation of the environment is also related to the accelerated growth of economic activity, due to the large amount of energy required in production processes (Churchill et al., 2019 ; Kacprzyk and Kuchta, 2020 ; Liu et al., 2020 ). However, previous literature has identified that there are several other factors that drive CO2  emissions, which are also related to access to clean fuels (Balezentis, 2020 ; Lin and Li, 2020 ; Su et al., 2018 ). Investigating those factors is vitally relevant towards a green recovery of the economy. As an example of this, Murthy et al. (1997)  is an important study which identifies that poverty is another factor that contributes significantly to increased CO2  emissions, since a considerable part of the worldwide population is living below the poverty line and does not have the necessary resources to meet their primary needs, as well as having much less access to environmentally friendly energy sources. Income poverty does not clearly distinguish the type of fuel or energy used (Boardman, 2020 ; Hill 2011 ), so the concept of energy poverty (EP) takes on a more significant connotation (DellaValle, 2019 ) when describing the efficiency of energy usage and its consequences on the environment (Birol, 2007 ). According to information provided by World Energy Outlook (2020) , over the next ten years, access to clean technologies for cooking in developing economies could prevent approximately 12 million deaths associated with the pollution generated by consuming polluting fuels. EP does not have a universally accepted definition, so it can be measured in various ways, such as access to urban/rural electricity, clean cooking technologies, heating or cooling of the home, and use of fossil fuels vs. electric vehicles, among others. These factors generally describe the comfort and well being of individuals (Alem and Demeke, 2020 ; Hassani et al., 2019 ; Mahoney et al., 2020 ). Although there is no clear consensus on the measurement of EP, there is a differentiation in the conception of EP between developed and developing countries. In developed countries, EP is generally related to the lack of clean fuels for heating homes, while for developing countries, EP is associated with access to electricity (Awaworyi et al., 2020; Sadath and Acharya, 2017 ). Therefore, access to electricity is synonymous with reducing EP because it allows for the substitution of fossil fuels that deteriorate the environment (Lin and Li, 2020 ). Furthermore, EP has profound microeconomic and macroeconomic implications in developing economies. From the microeconomic point of view, there is a limitation on individuals carrying out their daily activities, such as cooking, access to electricity, heating and use of electrical devices, among others; while from the macroeconomic side, it can lead to slow economic growth, environmental pollution, labor unproductivity and efficiency failures, among others (Qurat-Ul-Ann and Mirza, 2020 ). At present, according to statistics published by the BP Statistical Review of World Energy (BP, 2020 ), the consumption of energies that are not environmentally friendly – that is, associated with EP – are the most prevalent sources worldwide: oil (33.06%), natural gas (24.23%) and coal (27.03%), ranking above nuclear or hydroelectric energy. Thus, EP is a consequence of lack of access to clean and affordable energy (Alem and Demeke, 2020 ; Hasanov et al., 2019 ; Khan et al., 2020 ; Xu and Lin, 2019 ), hampering the achievement of SDG7. In this context, EP requires various efforts from economic agents in order to achieve the sustainable development of modern society (Alem and Demeke, 2020 ). Based on the above arguments, this research examines the determinants of CO2  emissions in developing countries, considering EP as one of the main driving forces behind CO2  emissions in such countries. Furthermore, according to our literature review, a number of other relevant factors have neither been jointly addressed in previous studies in the context of developing countries, nor addressed using advanced econometric techniques. Consequently, this research considers the integrated role of energy poverty (EP), Renewable energy consumption (REC), Gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic product square (GDP2 ), natural gas consumption (NGC) and trade freedom on CO2  emissions during the period 2001–2019. Consequently, the panel quantile regressions (PQR) technique is used to examine the heterogeneity of the distribution among various quantiles of CO2  (You et al., 2015 ). The advantage of PQR is that it examines distributive heterogeneity to provide a detailed description of the link between CO2  emissions and explanatory variables at different CO2  levels. Furthermore, PQR does not only focus on the conditional mean of the dependent variable. Consequently, PQR allows us to examine the variation of CO2  among the different quantiles. In addition, an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) forecast model is used to examine the behavior of the variables in the coming years. In this context, like previous studies such as those carried out by Ikram et al. (2020) , Lin & Li (2020)  and Rodrigues et al. (2020) , this research uses the variable ‘access to rural electricity’ to represent EP, since this geographical area has been forced to use fossil fuels or firewood, due to the lack of accessibility for the consumption of clean energy (Santos Pereira and Cardoso Marques, 2020 ). Furthermore, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, proposed by Kuznets (1955) , is validated. Unlike studies such as that of Ikram et al. (2020)  or Rasoulinezhad and Saboori (2018) , this study examines rural areas’ access to electricity in developing countries. Additionally, this research contributes to understanding how EP and the other driver variables affect the achievement of SDG7. Furthermore, it provides findings regarding heterogeneous emissions of CO2  in different quantiles, as well as forecasting emissions behavior in the coming years. Consequently, the study establishes a set of hypotheses to be validated, described in Section 2 . The article is structured as follows: Section 2  contains a review of the relevant prior literature and a statement of our hypotheses. Section 3  describes the data, model, and econometric methodology used. The results of the research and the discussion in relation to previous studies are described in Section 4 . Finally, Section 5  contains our conclusions and the development of policy implications.  2 Literature review This section is divided into five sub-sections, according to each of the explanatory variables used in the model. 2.1 Energy poverty and carbon emissions A study carried out by Lin and Li (2020)  across 114 countries shows that access to electricity is negatively associated with CO2  emissions; in contrast, economic growth and industrialization worsen environmental pollution. Similarly, Rodrigues et al. (2020) , in their study developed for the European Union, find that the correct use of electricity and access to renewable electricity contribute to the mitigation of CO2 . In a study carried out in China, Han et al. (2020)  find that reducing photovoltaic poverty in Chinese households and raising households above the poverty line has a significant advantage in reducing CO2 . Also, access to clean energy is positively related to air quality in China (Li et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, in Chile, Reyes et al. (2019)  mention that large quantities of firewood are demanded during the winter, while the concentrations of PM2.5 in the atmosphere exceed international standards. In Ethiopia, Alem and Demeke (2020)  show that an increase in kerosene price is positively associated with CO2  since it increases charcoal consumption, which is used as a substitute fuel but is highly polluting. The same occurs in Indonesia, where households having access to clean energy reduces indoor pollution (Imelda, 2020 ). On the other hand, there are also studies that mention a negative relationship between EP and CO2 . For example, in their research in France, Santos Pereira and Cardoso Marques (2020)  affirm that an increase in the price of electricity at peak hours leads to substituting the consumption of fossil fuels for renewable energies, which mitigates CO2 . Likewise, Ikram et al. (2020)  examine the drivers of polluting gas emissions in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. The results prove that access to electricity is positively related to CO2 . Hypothesis 1 (H1): Increased energy poverty is positively associated with carbon emissions.   2.2 Renewable energy consumption and carbon emissions Environmental degradation can be significantly reduced by good environmental practices, such as consuming renewable energy (Bekun et al., 2019 ; Charfeddine and Kathia, 2019 ). Saidi and Omri (2020)  assess the factors driving CO2  in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Their findings confirm that investment and renewable energy consumption (REC) reduce environmental pollution. In their study carried out in the BRICS countries (i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), Khattak et al. (2020)  find that REC contributes to the mitigation of environmental pollution and confirms the existence of EKC. Similarly, Rasoulinezhad and Saboori (2018)  examine the long-term relationship between renewable and non-renewable energy, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and CO2  in developed countries. Their study shows the negative effects caused by polluting energy sources and economic growth, while renewable energy contributes to the improvement of the environment. Similarly, in MERCOSUR (Spanish acronym for The Common Market of South America) countries, REC alleviates environmental pollution while non-renewable energy and GDP aggravate environmental deterioration (de Souza et al., 2020 ). For their part, Ummalla and Samal (2019)  indicate that in emerging economies such as China and India, increased natural gas consumption (NGC) and REC have led these economies to reduce CO2 . Finally, Moutinho et al. (2018)  use the complete additive decomposition technique to evaluate the behavior of CO2  in the 23 TOP countries in renewable energy. Their findings mention a negative effect on CO2  caused by increased REC and financial development, while fossil fuels increase CO2 . Hypothesis 2 (H2): Renewable energy consumption reduces carbon emissions.   2.3 GDP and carbon emissions CO2  emissions are mainly generated due to economic development (Gong et al., 2020 ; Kacprzyk and Kuchta, 2020 ; Munir et al., 2020 ). Some studies, such as that by Cheikh et al. (2021) , carried out in countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region using a threshold model, find that CO2  emissions depend on the economic level of each country; the more significant the country's economic development and consumption of energy, the more CO2  tends to decrease. Similarly, in a study of 121 economies worldwide, Kacprzyk and Kuchta (2020)  find an inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2  and economic development. Ren et al. (2020)  also find an inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2  and GDP in the lowest regression quantiles through a quantile regression panel in the BRICS countries. Similar results are found by Ridzuan et al. (2020)  in Malaysia. However, Boufateh and Saadaoui (2020)  find ambiguous evidence in their results regarding 22 African countries, indicating that EKC is only significant in the long term. In contrast, some studies affirm that CO2  emissions do not depend on a country's income level; that is, environmental pollution increases as economic growth increases (Malumfashi et al., 2020 ; Ren et al., 2020 ; Zafar et al., 2019 ; Zhu et al., 2016 ). For example, Munir et al. (2020) , in their research carried out in Asian countries, state that CO2  depends positively on economic growth, regardless of income level. The same result has been found in Australia; Nasir et al. (2021)  show that CO2  maintains a positive relationship with economic growth. Hypothesis 3a (H3a): Increased GDP is associated positively with carbon emissions.  Hypothesis 3b (H3b): Increased GDP2  is negatively associated with carbon emissions.   2.4 Consumption of natural gas and carbon emissions Some studies, such as that of Wang et al. (2019) , find that natural gas consumption (NGC) is a fuel option which can reduce environmental pollution. For example, a recent study by Lin and Agyeman (2020)  examines the effect of NGC on the environment in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Their novel results indicate that NGC is positively correlated with environmental degradation when the relationship is analyzed linearly. However, when addressing this relationship in a non-linear form, it is found that NGC is negatively associated with CO2  through improved technological progress. Another study carried out in China by Xu and Lin (2019)  with non-linear models finds that NGC and CO2  have an inverted U-shaped relationship in the Eastern Region, while in the Central and Western Regions, the relationship is U-shaped. Similarly, Li et al. (2020)  conduct a study of China's provinces, finding that technological improvement causes NGC to contribute to the mitigation of CO2 . Also, Dong et al. (2017)  mention that in China, natural gas is a good substitute for more polluting fuels such as coal or firewood, such that a 1% increase in its consumption represents a decrease in CO2  between 0.03% to 0.05%. On the other hand, Dong et al. (2017)  use the augmented means group (AMG) in the BRICS countries to examine the drivers of CO2 . Their results affirm that the consumption of natural gas and renewable energy contributes to the mitigation of environmental pollution. Similarly, Dong et al. (2018) , using second-generation long-term equilibrium techniques, confirm the existence of the EKC in Asia-Pacific countries and affirm that air quality can increase with increasing NGC. Hypothesis 4 (H4): Increased natural gas consumption is negatively associated with carbon emissions.   2.5 Trade freedom and carbon emissions One of the most recent studies developed by Wang and Zhang (2021)  analyzes the decoupling of CO2  in 182 countries classified according to their income level. The results show that trade openness allows for the reduction of CO2  emissions in high-income and upper-middle-income countries; however, this effect disappears in lower-middle-income countries and increases CO2  in low-income countries. These results are contrary to those found by Vural (2020) , who shows that commercial freedom leads to increased CO2  in selected Sub-Saharan African Countries. However, the study by Khan et al. (2020)  in nine oil-exporting countries shows that exports increase emissions, while imports positively affect environmental pollution. According to Hasanov et al. (2019) , the positive effects of imports and the adverse effects of exports on CO2  remain if only the developing oil-exporting countries are considered. In the same way, Safi et al. (2020)  perform an analysis which separately disaggregates the effect of imports and exports on CO2  in seven countries with developed economies (G-7). These findings reveal that imports increase CO2 , while exports and financial instability reduce them. In OECD countries, the increase in exports reduces CO2  from consumption, more than or equal to that from the territory (Liddle, 2018 ). On the other hand, in a study carried out in China (Wang et al., 2020 ), one of the countries causing the highest amounts of CO2 , indicates that while the technological progress in companies exporting new technologies generates a decrease in CO2  in developed countries, at the same time it increases CO2  in undeveloped countries. Hypothesis 5 (H5): Increased trade freedom is negatively associated with carbon emissions.    3 Data, model, and econometric approach 3.1 Data This research examines the determinants of CO2  emissions in developing countries, considering EP as one of the main driving forces behind CO2  emissions in such countries. According to the literature review, several other factors have not been jointly addressed in previous studies within developing countries. Consequently, this research considers the integrated role of energy poverty (EP), Renewable energy consumption (REC), Gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic product square (GDP2 ), natural gas consumption (NGC) and trade freedom on CO2  emissions in the period 2001–2019. Gross domestic product per capita square (GDP2 ) is incorporated into the analysis to validate compliance with EKC. Annex 1 presents some of the key previous studies that examine the determinants of CO2 ; additionally, the explanatory variables that each study uses are detailed. In this sense, this literature review contributes to defining the factors affecting CO2  and this study's contribution to the current state of the art. The defined factors have not previously been used to examine CO2 , and these relationships have not been examined in developing countries. Consequently, their contribution is unprecedented and significant to understanding how these factors determine SDG7. Accordingly, Fig. 1   describes in detail the process for selecting the explanatory variables of the study. First, a literature review process was carried out on the determinants of CO2 . After reviewing the documents, gaps in the literature in developing countries about CO2  were identified. Next, the factors used in other previous studies to define the variables of the present study were examined. Then, the availability of information was verified in various databases; consequently, the 25 countries with information available for the period under review were selected. Finally, having defined the countries under study and the variables for analysis, econometric estimates were made. This research uses official sources from 25 developing countries (see Annex 2) from 2001 to 2019. The dependent variable EP is measured based on "access to rural electricity". The data was obtained from the World Bank Development Indicators. This data is available for 59 countries; however, 28 out of 59 are developing countries. We found that information was not available for 3 out of the 28 countries; thus, 25 developing countries with complete information for the period were reviewed. The dependent variable represents the amount of CO2  in the air. Additionally, taking into account the various definitions of EP from the work of Hassani et al. (2019) , this study considers the percentage of people in rural areas without access to electricity as a proxy variable for EP. This variable was calculated as follows: from 100% of the rural population, people in the rural sector with access to electricity were subtracted. Fig. 2   shows the average EP in the period examined. The explanatory variables, REC (Bhattacharya et al., 2020 ), GDP / GDP2  (Huang et al., 2020 ), NGC (Naseem et al., 2020 ) and TF (Vural, 2020 ), were selected according to the previous analysis of the literature review, since these variables help to explain the behavior of EP in relation to environmental pollution. Following previous research (Khattak et al., 2020 ; Dong et al., 2018 ), the square of GDP (GDP2 ) is used to evaluate the EKC hypothesis proposed by Kuznets (1955) . EKC establishes that in the initial phase of countries' economic growth, CO2 pollution increases, while CO2 pollution decreases when countries have achieved significant economic growth. Table 1   presents the description and data sources used in the research. Table 2   shows the statistics of the variables used in the model. The skewness and kurtosis statistics describe the distribution of the variables. The Jarque-Bera probability allows rejection of the null hypothesis of normality between the variables, which argues that using the quantile regression panel is adequate to examine the heterogeneous effect of the explanatory variables on CO2 .  3.2 Econometric approach Before validating the long-term cointegration test, the cross-sectional dependence between the study variables should be considered in order to estimate efficient results (Yao et al., 2020 ). The cross-section dependency test identifies whether interdependence exists between the countries examined (Zeqiraj et al., 2020 ; Zhao et al., 2020 ). The interdependence that exists between countries is generally associated with economic, commercial, social and political relations, among others, that usually exist between countries (Khan et al., 2020 ), and generate the existence of dependence between the set of study variables (Breusch and Pagan, 1980 ). Consequently, the cross-sectional dependency (CD) test of Pesaran (2004)  is used to control this problem (Liddle and Huntington, 2020 ) and adequately define the root test unit suitable for the following steps. Pesaran's (2004) test establishes the null hypothesis of non-dependence between variables. This test can be written as follows:(1) CD = 2 N ( N − 1  )    ( ∑ i = 1  N − 1   ∑ j = i + 1  N  T i t   p ^  i j  2   )  → N ( 0 , 1  )         In Eq. (1) , p ^  i j     represents the correlation coefficients calculated from the model residuals, assuming that the mean value is zero and the variance constant. Next, the existence of cross-section dependence in the model variables suggests applying second-generation unit root tests instead of first-generation tests (Malumfashi et al., 2020 ). In this sense, following Qiao et al. (2019) , the series’ stationarity is examined with the cross-sectional augmented Im, Pesaran, and Shin (CIPS) test and the cross-sectional augmented Dickey-Fuller test (CADF) developed by Pesaran (2007) . The null hypothesis establishes the non-stationarity of the series. The CADF test can be written as follows:(2) Δ  y i , t   = α + β i  y i , t − 1   + γ i  y ¯  t − 1   + ∑ j = 0  p  θ i t   Δ  y ¯  t − j   + ∑ j = 1  p  τ i j    Δ  y i , t − j   + μ i t        In Eq. (2) , y ¯  t − 1     and Δ  y i , t − j      represent the averages of time T   of the N   countries examined. Next, the CIPS test is formalized, according to Eq. (3) :(3) C I P S = N − 1    ∑ i = 1  N  t i  ( N , T  )       Where t i  ( N ,  T  )     represents the t   statistic defined in Eq. (3) , an indispensable requirement for examining the long-term equilibrium between the model variables is that the variables are stationary; otherwise, the long-term tests may be biased and spurious (Jiang et al., 2020 ). Consequently, the second-generation Westerlund (2007) test is developed to examine the long-term equilibrium relationship, which controls heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. Westerlund's test (2007) examines four statistics, two of which are termed mean group statistics ( G t  ,  G α  )   , while the other two are panel statistics ( P t  ,  P α   )   . The null hypothesis establishes the non-cointegration of the study variables. The four statistics being estimated are described as follows:(4) G t  = 1 N  ∑ i − 1  N  δ i ′  S E ( δ i ′  )         (5) G α  = 1 N  ∑ i = 1  N  T δ i ′   δ i ′  ( 1 )        (6) P t  = δ ′  S E δ ′         (7) P t  = T δ ′       Where δ ′    represents the error correction term, which is calculated by substituting it in Eq. (7) ; the same term represents the adjustment speed towards equilibrium. Additionally, following Huang et al. (2020) , Malumfashi et al. (2020) , and Xu and Lin (2020) , the long-term cointegration results are contrasted with the cointegration methods of Pedroni (2004)  and Kao (1999) . The steps developed above are necessary to ensure that the long-term estimates are reliable and efficient (Koengkan and Fuinhas, 2020 ). The quantile regression model panel is then used to examine the nexus between CO2  and explanatory variables. One of the many advantages that this method offers is that it allows us to examine all the independent variables on different points of the CO2  variable (Guang et al., 2019 ), unlike other methods, such as OLS, which tend to focus only on the mean effects of the dependent variable. Thish can generate biased and inefficient estimators (Dogan et al., 2020 ), because in general, the data distributions of the variables from any study follow asymmetric distributions, with several inflexion points or heteroscedasticity (Akram et al., 2021 ). Regarding this concern, following Koenker and Bassett (1978) , PQR is used to examine the relationship between CO2  and EP, REC, GDP, GDP2 , NGC, and TF. This approach is advantageous in studying phenomena related to the environment since environmental degradation depends mainly on the country's economic categorization (Luo et al., 2020 ), and this method divides the distribution of the dependent variable into several quantiles (Muhammad et al., 2020 ). Thus, the estimation of CO2  by quantiles can be formalized as follows:(8) Q y it   ( π |  X it   )  = X it   π  ∀ π  + δ i       In Eq. (8) , Q y it   ( π | X it  )     represents CO2  in various quantiles π  t h    , X it   π    is a vector that contains the effect of the explanatory variables, defined in the section before π  t h     quantiles. ∀ π    measures the sensitivity of CO2  caused by the explanatory variables. Δ  I    symbolizes the fixed effect for country i = 1 , 2 , 3 , … , N    in the period t = 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , … , T   . Based on Eq. (8) , the panel estimate for the present investigation can be estimated as follows:(9) Q CO 2 it    ( π |  X it   )  = α 1 π   E P i t   + α 2 π   R E C i t   + α 3 π   G D P i t   + α 4 π   G D P i t  2  + α 5 π   N G C i t   + α 6 π   T F i t   + δ i       In Eq. (9) , C O 2     represents carbon emissions; EP   is energy poverty, REC   is renewable energy consumption, GDP   is economic growth, G D P 2     is the square of GDP  , N G C    is natural gas consumption and T F    is the trade freedom. The variable G D P 2     was included to validate EKC in the model at π  t h     quantiles. If α 3 π   > 0    and α 4 π   < 0   , EKC is fulfilled and ensures the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2  and GDP, controlled by the effect of EP. Then, when estimating Eq. (9) , when generating the regressions in the different π  t h     quantiles, the explanatory variables’ effect depends on the quantile but not on the fixed effect of each country (Goetzke and Vance, 2020 ). In this sense, Koenker (2004)  solves this problem by including a term called a penalty, which minimizes the variation caused by the estimated coefficients. Thus, the expression can be defined as follows:(10) min ( ϕ , ω  )   ∑ k = 1  K  ∑ t = 1  T  ∑ i = 1  N  W k  v π k   ( y i t   − ϕ i  − X i t  T  ω ( π k  )  )  + θ  ∑ i N  | ϕ i  |       In Eq. (10) , k = π 1  , π 2  , π 3  , … , π n    , t = 2001 ,  2002 ,  2003 , … , 2019    and i = 1 , 2 , 3 , … , 25   . X   represents the set of regressor variables, and v π k     is the lost function of the quantiles. W k    measures the weighting to the k t h    quantile.   4 Results and discussion This study examines the long-term equilibrium relationship between CO2  and its driving variables in 25 developing countries during the period 2001–2019. A number of econometric approaches have been designed to explain the relationship in question. Consequently, a list of explanatory variables is used that has not been addressed in previous studies in these developing countries. Before examining the results of the relationship between CO2  and EP, REC, GDP, GDP2 , NGC and TF, the cross-sectional dependency of the sections is evaluated, along with other studies that examine the behavior of CO2  with PQR (Ren et al., 2020 ). According to the probabilities of the Pesaran (2004)  CD tests (shown in Table 3  ), the null hypothesis of cross-sectional dependence between the variables is accepted. As a product of trade relations and globalization, among other factors, the countries in this study are interdependent, such that their behavior is reflected in the development of the others and vice versa (Malumfashi et al., 2020 ). After confirming the presence of cross-sectional dependence, second-generation unit root tests were employed. The CIPS and CADF unit root tests performed by Pesaran (2007)  were used, which control cross-sectional dependence in each section. Table 4   presents the results obtained from both tests. According to the probabilities shown, the null hypothesis of non-stationarity is rejected. The variables are non-stationary in level, while in their first difference, they become stationary and have order of integration I (1). An essential requirement to evaluate long-term cointegration is to ensure that the series is stationary; otherwise, the estimators are biased and inefficient, and the estimates become spurious (Malumfashi et al., 2020 ). In this context, the second-generation Westerlund (2007) test was used to examine the cointegration relationship. The results of Table 5   show that at 0.1% of significance, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected; that is, the existence of a long-term equilibrium relationship between CO2  and EP, REC, GDP, GDP2 , NGC, and TF. Like other studies (Huang et al., 2020 ; Malumfashi et al., 2020 ; Xu and Lin, 2020 ), the Kao (1999)  and Pedroni (2004)  test was used as a robustness test to validate long-term cointegration. Similarly, at 0.1% significance, the null hypothesis of no cointegration between the model variables is rejected. That is, long-term cointegration in the model variables is confirmed. After verifying the long-term equilibrium relationship between the model variables, the quantile regression panel was estimated, which allows us to examine the effects of EP, REC, GDP, GDP2 , NGC, and TF on CO2  at different quantile points (Zhang et al., 2016 ). Table 6   shows the relationships between the explanatory variables and CO2  in the 10th – 90th quantiles. It shows the heterogeneity of the coefficients of the explanatory variables according to the quantile of CO2 . Fig. 3   shows the effects of the explanatory variables on CO2 . EP has a positive and statistically significant effect, shown overwhelmingly in all quantiles π = 0.1    to π = 0.9   . Generally, EP is related to limited access to clean and sustainable energy for daily household activities in developing countries. EP is positively related to CO2  throughout all quantiles and shows an effect that varies slightly, from π = 0.1    to π = 0.9   . This behavior shows that EP affects lower levels of contamination, as well as higher levels. For example, when people do not have access to electricity, they cannot use modern cooking technologies, so they are forced to choose accessible and affordable fuels, such as firewood or fossil fuels, that cause environmental degradation, confirming hypothesis H1. These results support the findings of Alem and Demeke (2020) , and Imelda (2020)  in developing countries, such as Ethiopia and Indonesia; these studies mention that poor access to electricity leads to the use of polluting fuels in cooking food. In the same way, Reyes et al. (2019)  indicate that not having access to clean energy for heating increases firewood demand, which in turn worsens air quality. Next, REC has a negative and significant effect on CO2 , as described by hypothesis H2. The effect of REC is higher at the highest levels of contamination compared to the lower quantiles. In other words, when there are high levels of contamination, REC has greater force, because REC is a driver to achieve efficient practices in the environment (Khan et al., 2021 ). Clean energies come from renewable sources, which reduce CO2  in the environment (Bhattacharya et al., 2020 ; Saidi and Omri, 2020 ). These results confirm the findings of Khattak et al. (2020)  in a study conducted in the BRICS countries, as well as the findings of Rasoulinezhad and Saboori (2018)  and de Souza et al. (2020)  in a group of developing countries and MERCOSUR, respectively. Similarly, the increase in REC may be driven by its more affordable price, making it a good substitute for polluting energy (Ponce and Khan, 2021 ), according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA, 2018 ). For its part, GDP maintains a positive and statistically significant relationship from quantile π = 0.1    to quantile π = 0.9   . The same occurs with GDP2 , which shows a negative relationship in each quantile; this validates the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and CO2 . In other words, EKC is fulfilled for this group of developing countries, which means that these countries’ economic development contributes to the mitigation of environmental degradation in all quantiles. These two findings allow us to corroborate the suggestion of hypotheses H3a and H3b. GDP has a uniform effect from the lowest to the highest quantiles. In addition, the magnitude of the GDP2  coefficient decreases at the highest levels of CO2 ; however, the significance remains. These results are similar to those found by Huang et al., (2020) ; Ren et al., (2020) ; Salman et al., (2019) , and Cheikh et al., (2021) , who find an inverted U-shaped relationship in China, BRICS, ASEAN and MENA countries, respectively. It is also similar to the findings of Malumfashi et al., (2020) , Ren et al., (2020) , and Zhu et al., (2016) , for their studies carried out in the West African developing countries, the BRICS and ASEAN countries, in which a U-shaped relationship between pollution and economic growth is identified. Regarding NGC, in all quantiles, the relationship is positive and statistically significant. However, the findings are contrary to the proposal of H4. This contradiction may be explained by the fact that NGC emits less CO2  than other types of fossil fuels. However, this does not mean that it stops polluting the environment altogether. Also, NGC grows slightly from the lowest to the highest quantiles, which shows that higher CO2  is associated with higher NGC levels. This relationship may be because NGC is associated with a higher demand for this fuel in those regions with less access to electricity and is more affordable than energy from renewable energy sources. According to Naseem et al., (2020)  and Rafindadi and Yusof (2014) , this situation occurs in developing countries since polluting energies are demanded in more significant quantities than energy consumption from renewable sources. However, these results are in contrast to the studies developed by Wang et al., (2019) , Xu and Lin (2019) , and Lin and Agyeman (2020) , who mention that the consumption of natural gas reduces CO2  emissions in China and Sub-Saharan Africa, since it is a less polluting type of fuel than coal or firewood. As a final point, the results presented regarding TF show evidence of a negative relationship with CO2 . The behavior of CO2  does not show a marked trend progressing through the quantiles. These findings prove that having more commercial exchange options for the consumption of goods and services by companies and households, as well as companies’ commercialization and production, generates a decrease in environmental pollution. This information confirms hypothesis H5. The results are consistent with the findings of Wang and Zhang (2021) , who find that TF reduces CO2  in high- and upper-middle-income countries. In contrast, Vural (2020)  finds that TF increases CO2  in Sub-Saharan African countries. However, when compared to studies that examine imports and exports separately, the comparison varies. Several studies affirm that exports mitigate CO2 , and the increase in imports degrades air quality (Hasanov et al., 2019 ; Khan et al., 2020 ; Safi et al., 2020 ). The findings corroborate the importance of examining the driving variables of CO2  in the sample countries, which have not been addressed in previous studies. In addition, these factors emerge from detailed information on various quantiles of CO2 , which suggests a definition of various policy measures to achieve SDG7 according to different levels of contamination. Likewise, Fig. 4   graphically summarizes the effect of the estimated coefficients in different areas and the response of CO2  to the variation of the explanatory variables in the different quantiles examined. In this sense, quantile analysis identifies and provides important information for the definition of targeted policy measures to reduce CO2  emissions, based on the explanatory factors identified (Koengkan and Fuinhas, 2020 ). Through probabilistic forecasting, it is possible to make predictions and define correct decisions to mitigate the increase in CO2  in future in any other economy (Luo et al., 2020 ). According to Table 6  and Fig. 4 , heterogeneity can be identified in the conditional distribution of CO2 , therefore, it is expected that decision-making to mitigate CO2  emissions will be heterogeneous. In economies with relatively high CO2  levels, located in the upper quantiles, stronger policies will be required, compared to economies with CO2  levels located in the lower quantiles. The selection of measures aimed at reducing CO2  must consider the context in which they are developed; quantile prediction provides this information for efficient decisions (Muhammad et al., 2020 ). This type of policy targeting allows for an efficient decision on the use of resources to achieve SDG7. On the other hand, the predictive quality of the quantiles is essential to ensure the results described above. In this sense, the intervals produced in the quantiles are annual and are highly calibrated. It was stated above that the quantile forecast is within the 95% confidence intervals and differs significantly from a regression by OLS (Goetzke and Vance, 2020 ). The predictive quality of the quantiles can be seen in Fig. 4 . At the same time, knowing the independent variables’ impact on CO2  is as important as knowing their behavior in the future. For this reason, an ARIMA model is used to validate the predictive quality of the variables used in the model (Aladağ, 2021 ), which is based on error. Due to the limited availability of data, only six countries were selected with the minimum of observations to fulfill the essential criteria of the ARIMA. Thus, using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the most suitable model for each country was chosen, respectively. Furthermore, the smaller AIC and BIC values provide information on the best model for prediction (Akaike, 1974 ). Next, the precision of each predictive model was evaluated employing the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2 ). The MAPE, MAE and RMSE values, shown in Annex 3, are the lowest values of the chosen models, which suggests the highest precision in predicting the model variables (Armstrong and Collopy, 1992 ). Additionally, the MAPE values registered are less than 10%; that is, the variables have a high degree of prediction (Barrow, 2016 ). On the other hand, the R2  values measure the predictive power of each variable, which are high and reveal a solid prediction of each variable; the values are between 61.3% and 93.2%. In other words, each of the driving variables statistically fulfills the ability to predict their behavior in the future, which can be used to determine how the factors will modify CO2  emissions in the coming years. Consequently, this forecast becomes an important element of analysis in order to correctly define public policies to mitigate CO2  emissions in the future. In this sense, through an accurate forecast of CO2  drivers, a promising scenario is generated to achieve SGD7 in relation to environmental efficiency (Song et al., 2012 ). Likewise, through the ARIMA estimation, a forecast of the behavior of CO2  can be generated up to the year 2050. In this way, Fig. 5   provides information about CO2  levels in the coming years. Compared to 2019, it is expected that by 2030 CO2  will be reduced in Romania (1.79%), Brazil (1.35%), and in the Russian Federation (0.27%). Meanwhile, an increase in CO2  is expected in Colombia (4.97%), Bulgaria (2.02%) and Belaraus (1.46%). Additionally, concerning the forecast for the year 2050, the variation is more considerable. CO2  emissions will decrease in Romania (5.06%), Brazil (3.80%) and Russian Federation (1.20%). Moreover, in Colombia (16.48%), Bulgaria (5.50) and Belaraus (3.96) the CO2  will increase. Subsequently, based on the predicted values in the 2020–2050 period for each country, an estimate can be made using the ARIMA model, which can be seen for each country in Table 7  . According to the estimated coefficients for each regression, it is predicted that REC, GDP2  and TF will decrease CO2 . On the other hand, EP, GDP and NGC are catalysts of CO2 . These findings reiterate the effect that the explanatory factors will have on CO2  in the future. The effect of these factors on CO2  can be corroborated by analyzing the decomposition of variance (Goetz et al., 2021 ). In this way, Fig. 6   presents the impulse-response functions of the explanatory factors on CO2  (for the next 31 years, until 2050) with a 95% confidence interval. In other words, the error variance decomposition calculates the effect of each type of shock from the explanatory factors to the forecast error variance, thereby validating the effect of the explanatory variables in the coming years. In other words, the factors examined can predict the future behavior of CO2 , generating a range of options to improve environmental sustainability.  5 Conclusion and policy implications Despite significant recent advances made in energy consumption, such as access to electricity, electrical technologies and increased REC, EP persists, along with its negative consequences for the environment. Unlike previous studies, such as that of Ikram et al., (2020)  or Rasoulinezhad and Saboori (2018) , this study considers the effect of rural access to electricity on CO2  across 25 developing countries. The period examined is from 2001 to 2019, with other explanatory variables, such as REC, GDP, GDP2 , NGC, and TF, also being considered. These variables provide valuable information to understand the behavior of CO2  at different levels of the conditional distribution. Then, using Pesaran (2015), cross-section dependence between the variables was verified, with the second-generation unit root and long-term cointegration tests being used in the analysis. Subsequently, the quantile regression panel examined the behavior of CO2  in various quantiles. The effect of EP on CO2  was examined, showing low access to electricity causes increases in CO2 . Furthermore, the results show a direct relationship between NGC and CO2 . Concerning economic growth, the fulfillment of the EKC hypothesis is confirmed; the increasing development of economic activity is related to beneficial effects on the environment. For its part, REC shows evidence that the choice of this type of energy is the way towards air conservation. In the same way, TF allows the free choice to exchange goods and services and mitigate CO2 . These findings provide valuable insights regarding the behavior of CO2  at various levels, which is valuable information to help mitigate CO2  in developing countries. Moreover, this research provides valuable elements to draw a roadmap for the achievement of SDG7. Therefore, according to the results presented above for PQR and ARIMA, this study recommends that policymakers from the developing countries consider the following policy measures to achieve environmental sustainability:1) Currently, in the examined countries, of the total available energy, oil is the most in-demand (on average 37.10%) while renewable energy is the least consumed (on average 3.44%). Therefore, REC should be further promoted through incentive programs with preferential residential and industrial consumption rates.  2) In Bangladesh, Peru, Pakistan, India, South Africa, Morocco, and the Philippines, the lack of electricity access in rural areas is between 53% and 21%. Therefore, governments should increase access to electricity through investment in infrastructure, so that the energy network reaches these countries’ entire territory. The above arguments should be considered in order to displace the consumption of polluting energies in these countries, since oil (35.47%), natural gas (31.61%), and coal (23.15%) are the most consumed fuels in these developing countries.  3) The expansion of electricity coverage in rural areas must be accompanied by programs that provide, free of charge or at low prices, electrical appliances for domestic tasks; for example, induction cookers, electric heating equipment, electric showers, among others.  4) Increased economic activity generates a reduction in CO2 , which is why laws or regulations could be established in these countries so that a certain amount of GDP or company profits is allocated to improve energy intensity.  5) The NGC is the second-most in-demand fuel (30.07%), and is considered as a clean technology for cooking. However, it is a fossil fuel, and a substitute for electric stoves, which is more accessible due to the limited access to electricity service in rural areas. Therefore, taxes could be established, or subsidies eliminated and transformed into incentives for renewable energies or to promote electrical household appliances.  6) The precision of the future model variables offers the opportunity to establish future strategies regarding CO2  factors, which allows for the definition of future public policies to achieve SGD7.    Finally, like most scientific research, this study has certain limitations regarding the availability of information. First, country data is limited, so the number of countries per continent is better represented in some continents than in others. Another limitation is the availability of information on variables that allow us to understand aspects such as the percentage and type of electrical appliances used in the home or the elasticity of the price of energy for the price of fossil fuels. Furthermore, according to the literature review, access to electricity is one of the proxy variables for EP in developing economies. However, it is unknown whether household purchasing power conditions the lack of access to electricity. In this sense, the limitations of the research may become future research questions. Therefore, according to the conditions and possibilities of authors to collect primary information from households, the authors recommend examining EP in a number of developing countries to capture the economic and social conditions surrounding EP. Future research could also examine the relationship between environmental degradation and access to technologies at home.
