                  The world today revolves around energy, especially in the forms of electricity and heat. Distributed microgrids that incorporate renewable energy sources with conventional fossil fuels have especially gained strong momentum for providing power to rural areas. The present paper discusses the optimization of a hybrid system composed of CHP-based diesel generators (DG), a natural gas boiler, photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines (WT), and a battery bank (BAT) under tropical weather conditions. The HOMER optimization algorithm and sensitivity analysis tool are used to analyze the effect of project variables such as component prices, renewable resources potential, power grid breakeven distance, and power consumption profile on performance. The optimum scenario using only economic factors and assuming cycle charging is a PV/WT/DG/BAT/Boiler system with 6 kW of WT, 7.55 kW of PV, 10 kW of DG, and 21 kWh of battery that can achieve a 0.143 $/kWh cost of energy with a renewable fraction of 37.1%. Implementation of TOPSIS method considering sustainable development goals for criteria weighting eliminates the DG, and leads to a 100% renewable configuration of PV/WT/BAT/Boiler with 18 kW of WT, 33.2 kW of PV, 119 kWh of battery, and 0.301 $/kWh cost of energy. The main contribution of this study can be seen in providing a new approach for weighting the TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making process based on UN sustainable development goals. Furthermore, comparing the economic optimization results with multi-criteria optimization results for a stand-alone CHP unit provides a critical point of view on studies with a single-objective decision making process.

The world today revolves around energy, especially in the forms of electricity and heat. Distributed microgrids that incorporate renewable energy sources with conventional fossil fuels have especially gained strong momentum for providing power to rural areas. The present paper discusses the optimization of a hybrid system composed of CHP-based diesel generators (DG), a natural gas boiler, photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines (WT), and a battery bank (BAT) under tropical weather conditions. The HOMER optimization algorithm and sensitivity analysis tool are used to analyze the effect of project variables such as component prices, renewable resources potential, power grid breakeven distance, and power consumption profile on performance. The optimum scenario using only economic factors and assuming cycle charging is a PV/WT/DG/BAT/Boiler system with 6 kW of WT, 7.55 kW of PV, 10 kW of DG, and 21 kWh of battery that can achieve a 0.143 $/kWh cost of energy with a renewable fraction of 37.1%. Implementation of TOPSIS method considering sustainable development goals for criteria weighting eliminates the DG, and leads to a 100% renewable configuration of PV/WT/BAT/Boiler with 18 kW of WT, 33.2 kW of PV, 119 kWh of battery, and 0.301 $/kWh cost of energy. The main contribution of this study can be seen in providing a new approach for weighting the TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making process based on UN sustainable development goals. Furthermore, comparing the economic optimization results with multi-criteria optimization results for a stand-alone CHP unit provides a critical point of view on studies with a single-objective decision making process.

The inevitable exhaustion of traditional fossil fuels coinciding with the expansion of energy consumption compels governments and nations to take advantage of new energy sources (He et al., 2021 ). Although, renewable energy is considered to be rather less reliable compared to conventional power plants due to power production uncertainties and mismatches in the times of generation and consumption (Talaat et al., 2022 ) A storage unit can of course be used to solve this problem, but it greatly increases the cost of the system. Therefore, the high cost of hybrid renewable systems forces designers to carefully evaluate the power requirements and perform a precise sizing process to minimize the energy costs. Accordingly, the need for simultaneous use of several energy sources along with storage systems in stand-alone hybrid systems emphasizes the importance of targeted optimization methods (Baneshi & Hadianfard, 2016 ). Artificial intelligence methods and computer software used in sizing are divided into different general groups, all of which improve upon a generated initial population until the desired response is reached. MATLAB software is used for conducting optimization algorithms in many research papers. Pyomo, EnergyPlus, REopt, iHOGA, and other software are also used to optimize power generation systems. But among all these tools, HOMER (hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources) software, designed by the national renewable energy laboratory of the US, is one of the most useful ones (Sinha & Chandel, 2014 ). Optimizing the simultaneous supply of electricity and heat to meet stand-alone demands, despite creating higher energy efficiency, is also a very complex process that researchers around the world are endeavoring to improve. In recent years, research on combining heat and power (CHP) systems which incorporate renewable technologies has increased because of their enhanced energy efficiency and environmental benefits as a result of capturing waste heat when generating electricity (Barbieri, Spina & Venturini, 2012 ; Komeili, Nazarian, Safari & Moradlou, 2022 ). Bagherian et al. reviewed optimization techniques for hybrid renewable energy systems utilizing CHP and CCHP, showing that the most popular types of optimization were Economic and techno-economic. They concluded that evolutionary algorithms like GA and PSO could help to optimize the performance of such systems (Bagherian, Mehranzamir, Pour & Rezania, 2021 ). Maleki et al. optimized a grid-connected CHP system consisting of a wind turbine and hydrogen fuel cell by using a MOPSO algorithm. Their results showed that hybridization with CHP is an economical and reliable method for supplying energy demands, even though thermal energy storage equipment for a residential building is still expensive (Maleki & Rosen, 2017 ). Sagani et al. prepared a viability assessment of a CHP system including wind turbine (WT), diesel generator (DG), photovoltaics (PV), and battery storage for off-grid residential usage. The initial investment in the CHP systems was deemed too expensive to be developed without financial support and incentives for home users, but the biggest advantage was the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 13.5 tons per year (Sagani, Vrettakos & Dedoussis, 2017 ). Castellanos et al. showed that a biogas CHP with solar panels could provide peak load and about 60% of the off-grid energy demand for a rural area in India. They also stated that the use of hybrid renewable systems for remote areas in developing countries would improve the quality of life and create local business and research opportunities (Castellanos, Walker, Poggio, Pourkashanian & Nimmo, 2015 ). Shah et al. stated that coupling of CHP with PV-Battery systems for an off-grid residential house would overcome the problem of the periodicity of photovoltaic energy production, reduce emissions and bring about economic benefits for the consumer (Shah, Mundada & Pearce, 2015 ). Batas-Bjelic et al. by simulated a smart urban energy grid with PVs, WTs, and a CHP system. They showed that due to the flexibility of these networks in classifying energy prices plus the use of additional electricity through heat storage energy costs could be reduced even lower than market prices (Batas-Bjelic, Rajakovic & Duic, 2017 ). Isa et al. hybridized solar panels, fuel cells, and batteries with a CHP system for a grid-connected hospital in Malaysia and again showed that though installing CHP is too expensive, it can reduce the energy generation costs by 30% (Isa, Das, Tan, Yatim & Lau, 2016 ). Kim et al. conducted a case study in a residential and commercial building in Atlanta to investigate the effect of the hybridization of solar panels and microturbines with absorption chillers. They concluded that using waste heat would improve the thermal, and electrical efficiency of the system and also, reduces energy costs, energy consumption, and emissions (Kim, James & Crittenden, 2017 ). Waqar et al. analyzed a grid-connected CHP plant including PV, DG and battery in Pakistan, showing significant economic benefits resulting from a waste heat recovery system (Waqar et al., 2017 ). Effatnejad et al. analyzed a hybrid system with PV, WT, and CHP with two different storage systems, concluding that because of lower cost and better compatibility with the grid, using batteries instead of an electrolyzer-hydrogen tank as a storage system is recommended (Effatnejad, Rezapour & Vazinram, 2018 ). Local economic elements are always an impactful factor when analyzing a system's cost efficiency, which is why case studies are considered valuable. The internal rate of return for CHP systems is significantly influenced by the energy pricing policies of each country. In Iran, compared to European countries, there is less willingness to use combined heat and power systems because of lower energy prices. Other energy sources do not have the opportunity to compete with the usual way of purchasing power from the grid because of enormous energy subsidies. Khoshbazan et al. designed a Micro-CHP system with a powered photovoltaic Stirling engine to supply the energy requirements of a house in three different climates of Iran. Their results showed that this system has the largest reduction in carbon dioxide production, and despite good energy savings, the return of investment period is almost long (Khoshbazan, Ahmadi, Ming, Arjmand & Rahimzadeh, 2018 ). When optimizing a hybrid system, the final objective function is usually determined based on economic indicators, leading to selections with higher surplus electricity (technical weakness) and pollution (environmental challenge) plus low diversity of energy sources (low energy security) as the optimal scenario. Many researchers have used multi-objective optimization algorithms directly, or multi-criteria decision-making after economic optimization, to solve this problem. Table 1   represents the indicators and weighting methods used in some recent studies in the field of multi-criteria decision-making on optimum hybrid energy systems. As seen from the table, the most important criteria for the selection of an optimum hybrid energy system are economic, environmental, technical, social, and energy security parameters. However, choosing equal weights for these parameters is one of the challenges that can reduce the accuracy of the final decision (Salameh, Sayed, Abdelkareem, Olabi & Rezk, 2021 ). Many researchers have adopted MCDM using different methods; but the Entropy (Shannon), the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the analytic network process (ANP) are the most common methods used in the calculation of criteria weights. Furthermore, the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method is a policy-based method that does not work on a pairwise-comparison basis unlike the other common methods (Behzad, Hashemkhani Zolfani, Pamucar & Behzad, 2020 ). Therefore, choosing appropriate weights encompassing all aspects of sustainable development becomes a challenge if there is no proper vision of existing criteria policies, or no willingness to directly involve experts' opinions in determining weights. A consistent global benchmark that includes all aspects of sustainable development can help to find the optimal weighting of indicators based on the specific conditions of each region. The Sustainable Development Goals developed by the United Nations are one of the most comprehensive guidelines for the development of remote and rural communities. This benchmark consists of 17 main goals with more than 169 targets (Lamichhane, Eğilmez, Gedik, Bhutta & Erenay, 2021 ). Many sustainable development goals (SDG) are closely linked to the quality of available energy in each community, and SDG-17 standards have a flexible design to prioritize important issues for each region (Mondejar et al., 2021 ). This feature can be a great advantage for weighting the criteria for optimizing the energy system. In fact, the use of a global standard adopted by most governments and having a special focus on the use of renewable energy sources can provide benefits from social, environmental, and economic points of view in energy systems development policy (Bertheau, 2020 ). In addition, the relations of energy criteria with each sustainable development goal have been specified in this benchmark based on the priority of the goals announced by the United Nations (United National Development Programme (UNDP), 2017 ). Therefore, in this study, it was decided to use these criteria for the first time in determining the priority and weight of indicators affecting the selection of the optimal stand-alone energy system for rural energy supply. Based on the aforementioned literature, it can be concluded that three kinds of sensitivity analysis including component price changes, type of power consumption profile, and grid breakeven distance are neglected in the prepared CHP results. Also, most studies have focused on optimization based on economic goals. In this study, all of these are taken into account for a stand-alone CHP-based DG/Boiler/WT/PV/Battery system along with technical, economic, and environmental analysis. Furthermore, an SDG-based multi-objective decision-making process is provided in MATLAB environment to compare the results with conventional optimization of the HOMER algorithm. Due to the flexibility of the indicator prioritization method in this study, the results can be used by researchers in other parts of the world to perform the multi-criteria decision-making process based on local conditions. This study is significant because it analyzes the potential of weighting the decision-making criteria based on UN SDG-17 goals for a hybrid energy system that can be applied in any part of the world. Accordingly, due to the clarity of the UN goals and the level of sustainable development of any region, human intervention in the direct determination of weights is minimized. The novelty and contribution of the proposed study can be summarized in the following bullet points:• Proposing a new idea to improve the results of HOMER software by entering the optimal scenarios in an MCDM method.  • Comparing the economic optimization results with multi-criteria optimization results and clarifying the fact that considering economic goals independently cannot represent the optimal system.  • providing a novel approach for weighting TOPSIS MCDM process based on UN sustainable development goals unlike other studies that use pre-prepared weighting methods.  • Providing a hybrid renewable solution for deprived areas with the outstanding climate of West Asia as a less noticed kind of energy system in these areas.    In the following sections, input data, methodology, result and conclusion are analyzed respectively. The input data section includes the analysis of environmental data, the electricity and heat consumption, and the fuel and component prices subsections. The methodology section is consistent of schematic of the hybrid system, TOPSIS method, SDG weights for TOPSIS, power producer equations, economic parameters, and objective function definition. Finally, the results section includes the optimal size of the systems in HOMER, COE comparison, CHP performance, Economic sensitivity analysis, Load sensitivity analysis, Grid breakeven distance, and TOPSIS results.  2 System’s description and input data Due to the high volume and diversity of the input data, this section is dedicated to detailing the data used in this simulation. In this section, environmental parameters of the selected area, electricity and heat consumption, fuel prices, and component costs are investigated in separate subsections. 2.1 Schematic of the hybrid system Fig. 1   demonstrates a schematic diagram of the simulated model including PV, WT, DG, and battery bank along with a boiler that is connected to the electrical grid. These sources are considered for supplying both electrical and thermal loads. The WT and DG are connected to the AC bus bar and the PV and battery are connected to the DC bus bar. The power converter used here is consist of an inverter (transforming DC to AC) and a rectifier (transforming AC to DC). HOMER software is used to simulate the proposed hybrid system. This software calculates the optimal scenario based on the best economic characteristics (mainly NPC minimization) (Toopshekan, Youse & Astaraei, 2020 ). A dispatch strategy is a set of rules used to control the battery bank and the generator operation whenever the renewable energy is insufficient to supply the load. HOMER software employs different dispatch options. The objective of the dispatch strategy is to control the system so that the electrical load is met in a satisfactory manner. The dispatch strategy used in this investigation is cycle charging (CC). The process of this dispatch strategy is shown in Fig. 1 . The CC dispatch mechanism forces the generator to operate at its maximum capacity whenever necessary. In this instance, the battery storage unit is charged using the extra power. As can be seen, HOMER commercial software has a single-criteria decision-making process based on just economic objectives for optimal scenarios. This drawback can lead to optimal scenarios with high emissions, high excess (waste) electricity, or high power shortages, which is against the sustainable development goals. To overcome this challenge, a well-known multi-criteria decision-making method called TOPSIS has been used on the outputs of HOMER. But, due to the lack of a fixed criterion for weighting the parameters and the frequent involvement of human intervention, this method also has some drawbacks. Due to these two drawbacks, in this study, for the first time, the weighing method is done based on 17 main goals and 169 targets of UN sustainable development goals. Based on this, whenever any of the decision-making criteria is effective in any of the 17 sustainable development goals, its weight ratio increases compared to criteria with lower effectiveness. Therefore, with this approach, human interference in obtaining the weights is minimized. Furthermore, a global energy-related fixed standard is applied to estimate the weights that can be used in all parts of the world, the main weakness of the HOMER software is covered, and the optimal system will be selected based on the criteria of the United Nations Agenda 2030.  2.2 Analysis of environmental data As shown in Fig. 2  , the highest solar radiation in Naein city, Iran (Latitude 32.8599° N, Longitude 53.0878° E) occurs during the summer, between June and July. The lowest daily radiation is 2.69 (kWh/m2 /d) in December and the highest radiation is 7.28 (kWh/m2 /d) in June. Fig. 3   shows the annual temperature data. The highest average temperature, 28.32 °C, happens in July while the lowest temperature, 2.47 °C, is in January. The importance of ambient temperature lies in that it could affect PV power production. According to Fig. 4  , the wind speed profile is approximately uniform except for June, July, and August, when the average wind speed surpasses 7 m/s. In other months, the wind speed remains mostly steady and equals 5 to 6 m/s. The total average wind speed in the region is 5.94 m/s. Therefore, wind potential is suitable for most of the year and solar potential is also appropriate except during the winter season. Since the average temperature of the region in different months is not too high, there will be no significant negative effect on the performance of solar panels caused by overheating.  2.3 Electricity and heat consumption In this paper, the profile of electricity and heat consumption of 10 households in Naein city, Iran, has been estimated and then simulated by HOMER software for a year based on the tropical condition of the selected area. Accordingly, the average daily electricity usage of households is 112.7 (kWh/d). As depicted in Fig. 5  , the highest electricity consumption happens in the summer, from June to August. Also, the average heat consumption of the residential sections is 125.5 (kWh/d). Fig. 6   shows profiles of heat demand in different months. Although there are power transmission lines in the county of Naein, providing electricity and heat to residents on the outskirts of small towns in Iran is always a challenge. Despite the low energy consumption, these areas can use electricity and heat as domestic, industrial, or commercial loads. It should be noted that the residential section experiences the main energy challenge due to its lower priority in power supply.  2.4 Fuel and component prices Although the purpose of this study is to supply energy in a stand-alone way, due to the need to compare the pollution level of the proposed hybrid system with the power grid and also optimize the grid breakeven distance, the national grid characteristics are presented in this section. Iranian power plants use natural gas as the main fuel for producing electrical power. The operation lifetime of the power plants’ equipment, system efficiency, and quality of the fuel are the most important factors affecting the increase of power plants' emissions. The amount of pollution created by the power plants, according to the Energy Balance Sheet of Iran, is given in Table 2  . In addition, the estimated cost of developing power lines is estimated at between 8000 $/km and 22,000 $/km, based on the difficulty of the terrain which affects installation costs (Jahangir, Fakouriyan, Amin & Rad, 2020 ). In this simulation, in addition to the grid, the diesel fuel used in the DG and the natural gas required for the boiler are considered pollutants. The general specifications of the used fuels are shown in Table 3   and the equipment prices are given in Table 4  . The converter's inverter (DC to AC) and rectifier (AC to DC) efficiency are both 95%. Also, the batteries’ roundtrip efficiency are 90%.   3 Methodology In the presented study, the proposed system consists of both conventional and renewable resources, a combination that increases reliability, reduces total costs, and leads to a more credible optimization. 3.1 TOPSIS method TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), is a multi-criteria decision-making approach. It compares various alternatives, systems, or choices based on different pre-prepared criteria. The sustainable development goals are proposed as a general approach in TOPSIS MCDM for weighting economic, technical, environmental and energy security criteria. Then, the optimized hybrid energy system is investigated by the aforementioned MCDM as a specific case. The steps for implementing TOPSIS are as follows: Step 1 Specifying the criteria (m) and alternatives (n):(1) i = 1 , 2 , 3 , … m  a n d  j = 1 , 2 , 3 , … , n        The criteria or the objective functions of the optimization algorithm can be positive or negative; furthermore, for each of the optimized scenarios, an alternative is introduced. Step 2 The related criteria and alternatives evaluation for the decision matrix (X  ) and the weight matrix (W) must be defined as follows:(2) X = { x i j   }   a n d  W = [ w i  ]         For creating the weight matrix, the following steps are needed based on the entropy method. Step 3 Define the normalized matrix:(3) N i j   = x i j   ∑ i = 1  m  x i j            Step 4 Estimate the k value based on the number of criteria (m):(4) k = 1 ln m          Step 5 Determine the entropy for each alternative:(5) E j  = − k ∑ i = 1  m  N i j    .  ln N i j          Step 6 Survey the weight matrix:(6) w j  = ( 1 − e j   )  ∑ j = 1  n  ( 1 − e j   )           Step 7 Obtain the normalized form of the decision matrix:(7) R = x i j   ( ∑ i = 1  m  x i j  2   )   0.5           Step 8 Calculate the weighted normalized matrix:(8) V = R × W        Step 9 Determine the positive and negative ideal solutions:(9) A +  = ( v 1 +  ,  … , v m +   )  = { ( m a x  V |  p o s i t i v e  c r i t e r i a )  ,  ( m i n  V |  n e g a t i v e  c r i t e r i a )  }      (10) A −  = ( v 1 −  ,  … , v m −   )  = { ( m i n  V |  p o s i t i v e  c r i t e r i a )  ,  ( m a x  V |  n e g a t i v e  c r i t e r i a )  }         Step 10 Estimate the relative distance of each obtained solution from the ideal solution:(11) S +  = ∑ i = 1  m  ( v +  − v i j    )   2        (12) S −  = ∑ i = 1  m  ( v −  − v i j    )   2           Step 11 Calculate the closeness coefficient:(13) C j  = S −  S −  + S +    ; 0 ≤ C j  ≤ 1 ,  f o r  j = 1 , 2 , … ,  n         3.2 SDG weights for TOPSIS The SDGs are the blueprint to access a better and sustainable future for people. They clarify the important challenges like poverty, climate change, environmental degradation, inequality, peace, and justice. Fig. 7   indicates the 17 SDGs stated by the United Nations in order of importance. Nine of these 17 goals are related to the energy optimization problem. Also, there are 4 general categories of objectives including Economic, Social-Environmental, Technical, and Energy Security Objectives. Table 5   indicates which goal is related to HOMER parameters and categories. To match the SDGs to the decision-making objectives, the 169 targets of the 17 main goals must be considered. Each of these targets, which can be accessed from (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/ ), describes the context covered by each of the main goals. If even one target mentions a relationship with one of the decision-making objectives (criteria), the goal (SDG) related to that target enters the weighting process. The relationships identified with the decision criteria for remote areas of Iran are summarized in Table 5 . Here, two views will arise: first, weighting based on the number of SDGs identified for each category, and second, weighting considering the importance of SDGs with the lower assigned number. Both of which are considered in this case study. It should be noted that in the equal weighting, all 14 parameters have the same weight. In the SDG equal weighting, each parameter weights as the number of goals covered regardless of the priority of goals. In the end, the SDG priority weights column indicates the weight of parameters due to the priority of goals. The simple method used for scoring the parameters is as Eq. 14 .(14) P a r a m e t e r ′ s  s c o r e  =  ∑ i = 1  n  ( 18 − S D G  n u m b e r  )      Where n is the number of SDGs that are related to a parameter. This equation scores the SDGs based on their importance. For example, SDG-1 achieves 17 points, SDG-3 achieves 15 points, SDG-7 achieves 11 points, and so on. Finally, each parameter weights equal to the sum of SDG points related to that parameter. Fig. 8   shows the decision-making process. The first step is collecting the related data of electrical load, components’ price, resources, and economic data. The second step is inserting data into HOMER software and achieving the results of different scenarios. The third step is determining the weights of TOPSIS decision making and the last step is putting up the considered weights into the TOPSIS model in MATLAB.  3.3 Power producer equations In the following equations, the mathematical modeling of each component of the system is described.• PV power equation     Flat PV panels generate power from solar radiation and their output depends on the characteristics of PV and the cell temperature. The PV power equation is shown below (Jahangir et al., 2020 ):(15) P P V   = P P V  r a t e d   × f d P V    × G 1000  ×  [ 1 +  α (  T c e l l    − 25  )   ]      where G is solar radiation (w / m 2    ), P P V  r a t e d     is the PV rated power, f d P V     is the panel derating factor (3% per year), α   is the temperature coefficient of power 0.49 (%/ °C), and T c e l l     is the cell temperature. Also the overall efficiency of module is considered to be 15.3%.• WT power equation     The hourly power output of a WT, at a particular location, depends on the air density, windmill area, power coefficient of the wind turbine, and the hourly wind velocity V (m/s). Eq. 2  shows how the output power of the turbine differs based on the power curve.(16) P W T   = { 0  V ≤ V c u t i n       P r a t e d   V r a t e d  3  − V c u t i n  3     · V 3  − V c u t i n  3    V r a t e d  3  − V c u t i n  3     . P r a t e d    V c u t i n    ≤ V ≤ V r a t e d       P r a t e d    V r a t e d    ≤ V ≤ V c u t o f f       0  V > V c u t o f f             where V c u t i n     is the cut-in wind speed (m/s), V c u t o f f     is the cut-off wind speed (m/s), and V r a t e d     is the wind speed (m/s) at which the turbine generates its rated power (P r a t e d    ) (Luta & Raji, 2018 ). The power curve of this unit is assumed such as a 1.5 kW AWS model wind turbine.• Boiler equations     In order to respond to a large part of the annual thermal demand, a boiler with 85% efficiency is used. Natural gas, which has about 67% of carbon content, is the fuel used in the boiler. The operation cost of the boiler is calculated by equation (17)  (Poursistani et al., 2014).(17) C b o i l e r   = ∑ h = 1  24  [ P g a s   . G a s b o i l e r    ]  . ( 365 )  . F     where P g a s     is the energy price of gas ($/kWh), and G a s b o i l e r      is calculated by Eq. 18  (Study, 2014 )(18) G a s b o i l e r   = H b o i l e r   η b o i l e r   . H V       where  H b o i l e r      is the heat production (kWh), η b o i l e r      is the boiler efficiency, and H V    is the heating value of natural gas. Also, F   is the boiler Recovery factor (Study, 2014 ), which is calculated based on i: interest rate and n: boiler operation lifetime.(19) F = ( 1 + i  )   n  − 1  i ( 1 + i  )   n        • Diesel Generator     Integration of a fuel generator with renewable resources makes the hybrid system more flexible in the power supply process which leads to a more affordable stand-alone hybrid system. The selected generic diesel generator in this study has a 25% heat recovery ratio that can be used as a CHP unit. The hourly diesel fuel consumption of this generator is calculated based on the following equation:(20) F D  ( t )  = A . P R  + B . P ( t )      where P ( t )    refers to the generator output power in each time step, F D  ( t )     denotes the fuel consumption, and P R    is the rated power of the generator. A and B are the constant values equal to 0.08  L/kW and 0.24 L/kW, respectively (Sawle, Gupta, & Bohre, 2018 ).  3.4 Economic parameters and objective function definition The total NPC is the result of a compilation of capital, replacement, operation, and maintenance costs, and also resource-related costs. Its value can be calculated from Eq. 21  (Rad et al., 2022).(21) C N P C   = C A  C R F ( i ,  L T  )         In this equation, C A    is the annualized total cost ($/year), and C R F ( i ,  L T  )      is the capital recovery factor, which is obtained by Eq. 22  (Razmjoo et al., 2021 ).(22) C R F ( i . L T  )  = i ( 1 + i  )   L T    ( 1 + i  )   L T   − 1       L T    is the project lifetime (year), and i   is the annual real interest rate, which is obtained by Eq. 23  (Razmjoo et al., 2021 ).(23) i = i ∘  − f  1 + f       i ° = nominal interest rate (%)  f  = annual expected inflation rate (%)    Based on the announced rate of the Central Bank of Iran, the discount rate and the annual inflation rate are considered to be 18% and 16%, respectively, over 20 years of the project's lifetime. The COE is the mean cost of energy for comparing the cost-effectiveness of systems (Goswami & Sadhu, 2021 ). Eq. 24  shows the COE formula (Shahsavari et al., 2022 ).(24) C O E = C a n n . t   E s e r v e d        where C a n n . t     is the total annualized cost of components, and E s e r v e d     is the consumed energy in one year. Overall renewable fraction of generated power is calculated by Eq. 25 .(25) O R F = 1 − E n o n r e n   + H n o n r e n    E s e r v e d   + H s e r v e d         where E n o n r e n     and H n o n r e n     refer to the nonrenewable fraction of useful generated electrical energy and thermal power, respectively. Also, E s e r v e d     and H s e r v e d     denote the served electrical and thermal annual demands, respectively. In this study, the generated thermal energy by the CHP unit is considered to be renewable power because it prevented natural gas consumption in the boiler. Furthermore, when the thermal-related parameters are removed from Eq. 11 , the electrical renewable fraction or ERF is calculated. Salvage is an effective value on economic calculation and specifies the value of the components at the end of the project lifetime. In HOMER software, the salvage value of a component is directly related to its leftovers life. It also assumes that the salvage value appertains to the replacement cost rather than the initial capital cost. HOMER calculates the Salvage value from Eq. 26  (Jahangir et al., 2020 ).(26) S = C r e p   R c o m p   −  ( R p r o j   − R c o m p   . I N T ( R p r o j   R c o m p    )  )   R c o m p        where C r e p      is the replacement cost, R c o m p     is the component's lifetime, R p r o j     is the project lifetime, and I N T    is a rounding function for converting an integer number to a real number.   4 Results and Discussion This section is divided into the six sub-sections, first, the optimized configuration and CHP performance are discussed in 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. Due to the variation in component prices and energy usage, the economic sensitivity and load sensitivity is analyzed in 4.3 and 4.4 respectively. Also, the grid breakeven distance is analyzed in sub-section 4.5  for finding the minimum distance of the off-grid residential section from the nearest power transmission lines. Finally, the TOPSIS method is implemented for multi-criteria decision-making in sub-section 4.6 . 4.1 The optimal size of the systems in HOMER In this section, technical and financial results of the optimum system are analyzed. Table 6   shows the characteristics of the optimized hybrid energy system by the HOMER software. The first and most economic scenario utilizes all three energy sources, combining six wind turbines (9 kW) with 7.5 kW PV, 10 kW diesel generator, and 21 kWh batteries. The least economic scenario is one that supplies energy from renewable resources only, with 12 wind turbines (18kW), 33 kW PV, and 119 kWh of batteries. The high battery capacity for the aforementioned scenario has naturally resulted in a prominent rise in the COE and NPC, both factors almost 100% higher than the WT/PV/DG/Battery scenario. As anticipated, the PV/DG/Battery scenario is more economic than the WT/DG/Battery since the PV is currently the most cost-efficient system among renewable energy systems. The distribution of electricity and heat generation for the WT/PV/DG/Battery scenario is demonstrated in Table 7  . In colder seasons with lower electrical demand, the three systems are responsible for roughly the same share of power production. For the warmer months, which exhibit a spike in electrical demand due to cooling consumption, diesel and PV have the highest and lowest share of power production, respectively. The performance of wind turbines is distinctly improved in the summer months on account of stronger wind potential. However, PV electricity production does not increase significantly from winter to summer despite heightened solar radiation. Therefore, although PV is an overall better choice compared to wind turbines for the system as a whole, with high wind speed the turbine becomes a superior option for generating power. As shown in Fig. 3 , the city of Naein rarely faces sub-zero temperatures throughout the year. Hence, the thermal demand remains relatively unvarying from summer to winter. Approximately 80% of the heat demand is supplied from the boiler by burning natural gas, the cheaper fuel, and the rest is supplied from CHP. There is a notable increase in the share of CHP in heat generation during the summer months, which stems from the extra usage of the diesel generator and the available recovered heat during this time. Explicitly, the diesel consumption is increased in the summer to make up for added demand and some of the extra power that is produced is diverted towards supplying heat. Contrary to PV and wind turbine, the low capital cost of the diesel generator has led to the installation of a 10 kW generator, beyond the need of the 10 households, to be economic. However, the high price of fuel compared to the low maintenance on PV and wind turbine means that the system only falls back on the diesel generator when the demand goes up. In other words, the additional electrical demand in the summer is not high enough to warrant the installation of more renewable resources. The yearly electricity output from PVs, wind turbines, diesel generators, and discharging batteries for the PV/WT/DG/Battery scenario is depicted in Fig. 9  . The photovoltaics naturally produce power during daylight hours while the diesel generator and batteries act as complimentary power generators that mostly supply electricity during the night. As mentioned before, the diesel generator is active more frequently in June till August, especially in the afternoon when temperature rise causes high cooling demand.  4.2 COE comparison In this section, a comparison between this paper and other papers has been done. Table 8   states that researchers have resulted in different optimal COEs by installing different CHP-based systems. Among these studies, hydrogen systems, micro gas turbines, diesel generators, and boilers have been more commonly used to produce heat and power simultaneously. Choosing COE as an objective function allows a comprehensive comparison among investigations with different systems and different sizes. Also, unlike the NPC, the lower COE in one article simply indicates that the system used in that article is more efficient. The most important factors affecting the COE are the type of system used to provide power, the price of components, and the fuel and grid's electricity price in the country where the research was conducted. In general, grid-connected systems have a lower cost than stand-alone systems. The use of a fuel cell has led to higher energy costs due to its higher price. Also, in countries with high fossil fuel prices, such as European countries, the cost-effectiveness of diesel generators and boilers is lower than the other countries. The optimal COE in this article is 0.143 ($/kWh), which is lower than all the other off-grid systems mentioned in Table 8 .  4.3 CHP performance The Simultaneous supply of electrical and thermal demand by the generator promotes less fuel consumption and higher efficiency for the power system. Table 9   demonstrates the annual power production and fuel consumption of the diesel generator and the boiler. Also, the fuel profit of the proposed hybrid renewable energy system as compared against the pure use of DG for electrical demand and pure use of boiler for thermal demand is also shown in Table 9 . Additionally, the yearly profile for natural gas and diesel consumption of the PV/WT/DG/Battery system is shown in Fig. 10  (a) and Fig. 10 (b), respectively. Hybridizing the system has achieved a 70% profit in comparison to supplying all electricity from diesel, and a 20% profit compared to supplying all heat from natural gas. Since natural gas shortage in the winter is a rather common occurrence, a hybrid system also provides better reliability. Another observation from the table is that the diesel generator's total power production per year is 80% of the power production from natural gas. However, fuel consumption and fuel cost for natural gas have decreased by 27.5% and 81% compared to the diesel generator, respectively. The profiles of power production, electrical demand, and thermal demand of the PV/WT/DG for a typical week in summer are displayed in Fig. 11  . PV production has a figuratively repetitive pattern while the more random nature of wind potential means no unique pattern can be distinguished regarding electricity production from the wind turbine. The excess electricity is mostly produced at times of high power generation from the wind turbines. Therefore, the capacity of PVs is suitable in terms of excess electricity as most of the electricity production of PVs is consumed immediately instead of being stored for later use. As seen in Fig. 9 , the power production of the diesel generator coincides with high electrical demand and low PV production. Since the diesel generator generates both heat and electricity, high electricity production from the diesel generator also means that boiler production can be lowered. However, as seen in Fig. 9 , there are times when diesel heat generation exceeds thermal demand. Therefore, the operation of the diesel generator is primarily dependent on electrical demand and thus results in waste heat at times, which could be considered a weakness in an optimal system.  4.4 Economic sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis is important for finding the robustness of the optimal system. Different PV, WT, and DG prices affect the optimum cost of energy. Table 10   shows different price ranges for these components. This price difference can increase the NPC of the system and make the system non-optimal. Therefore, it is necessary to determine what price thresholds for the PV, WT, and DG will significantly increase the cost of energy. By considering other studies in the field of hybrid energy power supply, the cost range of 600 to 2800 $/kW for PV, 600 to 3200 $/kW for WT, and 177 to 700 $/kW for DG is selected for sensitivity analysis. In the present study, the HOMER surface plot sensitivity analysis tool is used for determining the variation of COE in each initial cost range of the component. The effect of PV and DG capital costs on the COE of the PV/WT/DG hybrid system is shown in Fig. 12   (a). The constant COE lines of the graph are close to being vertical, meaning the COE is more sensitive to the capital cost of PV than it is to DG capital cost. For example, if the starting point is considered 170 $ for DG and 600 $ for PV, multiplying the cost of DG four times only increases COE by about 8%. However, the same increase in PV capital cost raises the COE more than 17%. The effect of PV and WT capital cost on COE is shown in Fig. 12  (b) and the effect of WT and DG capital cost on COE is shown in Fig. 12  (c). DG capital cost clearly has the weakest impact on COE while the effect of the initial cost for PV and WT on COE is almost equal. It is also concluded from Figs. 12 . (a-c) that even by increasing components capital cost by more than 200%, the rise of COE would still be less than 60%. Fig. 12 (d) demonstrates how diesel fuel price and battery cost influence the COE. With low fuel prices, the battery becomes redundant and therefore the COE remains more or less constant by increasing battery cost. As shown in the figure, the effect of battery cost on the COE becomes more noticeable as the fuel price rises. A decisive factor in the performance of a renewable hybrid system is resource potential. Fig. 13  (a) demonstrates how average wind speed and solar radiation affect the NPC of the PV/WT/DG plant. While low resource determinedly causes heightened NPC and reduces probability, the sensitivity is lower for radiations higher than 6 kWh/m2 .day and wind speed greater than 8 m/s; indicating that the PV and wind turbine have reached maximum efficiency. The sensitivity of yearly CO2  emissions against boiler efficiency and the heat recovery ratio of the diesel generator is shown in Fig. 13 (b). Boiler efficiency is imperative in reducing emissions, but increasing the DG heat recovery ratio only brings a slight change in emissions. The lack of remarkable emission sensitivity to the DG heat recovery ratio is due to the lower share of CHP in supplying heat.  4.5 Load sensitivity analysis In order to show the impact of different loads on the optimal system, two other types of loads are considered. By considering different loads, it can be seen that the results are only optimum for a certain load profile or not. Commercial and industrial loads are considered for obtaining the optimal size of the system in this section. To determine the effect of the shape of the load annual average of this simulated load is 112.7 kWh/d for electrical demand and 122.5 kWh/d for thermal demand, exactly like residential demand. Fig. 14  and Fig. 15    show the seasonal electrical and thermal power consumption profiles in different usages, respectively. Unlike residential demand, the peak of the commercial load is at midday, between 8 AM and 5 PM. In addition, considering the 24-hour consumption of industrial units and having a relatively constant amount of energy requirement during one day, the demand profile is without severe alternation or high peak. As can be seen, although the daily consumption is constant, a change in the power consumption profile leads to a change in the peak of demand. Accordingly, the peak of electrical & thermal demand in residential, commercial, and industrial usages are 26.7 & 14.8 kW, 18.8 & 21.1 kW, and 9.9 & 10.9 kW, respectively. Table 11   indicates the techno-economic characteristics of the optimized hybrid energy system in different types of load. According to Table 11 , both the commercial and industrial systems are more economic when compared to the residential PV/WT/DG plant. The commercial unit has the advantage of peak demand coinciding with midday when PV production is at its height. Therefore, the capacity of PVs is raised for this unit while fewer wind turbines and batteries in addition to a smaller diesel generator are used. The COE for the commercial unit has dropped 12.5% compared to the residential plant. As for the industrial unit, the steady demand profile has led to a dramatic decrease in the number of needed batteries, lowering costs. While the capacity of PV and diesel generator has also decreased in comparison to the residential and commercial units, the number of wind turbines has remained the same as the residential unit. The COE of the industrial unit has decreased by 14% compared to the COE of the residential plant. Considering how all three units have the same daily demand, the results further emphasize the positive impact of load uniformity on both system performance and cost. A comparison of the thermal demand profile and heat production from boiler and CHP for the residential, commercial, and industrial units is depicted in Fig. 16  . The commercial unit has the best performance with the least amount of wasted heat generated throughout the week. The heat production also rarely surpasses thermal demand for the industrial unit, which requires a steady supply of both heat and electricity during the night. Therefore, once again the residential unit has the least desirable output as compared to the other two presumed systems.  4.6 Grid breakeven distance The grid breakeven distance is the minimum distance of the nearest power transmission lines from a residential section that the hybrid system is still optimal. Any distance less than the breakeven distance leads to the choice of expanding the national grid in the off-grid area. This crucial parameter depends on electricity production and the grid distribution cost, meteorological data, and the components’ cost of the off-grid hybrid system. To this end, the HOMER optimization module is applied and the results are shown in Fig. 17  . The borderline between the two colors shows the limit that the optimal system configuration, changes from PV/WT/DG/Battery to DG/Grid. For the assumed grid cost range, any distance less than 2.8 km would mean that the hybrid renewable system is not cost-efficient, while for distances further than 6.4 km the PV/WT/DG/Battery is the more proficient choice. The relationship between grid cost and system type is not linear, meaning that as transmission costs become more expensive, the hybrid solution becomes economically viable for a wider range of distances. The optimum system based-on electrical load consumption and grid extension distance is shown in Fig. 18   (a). The DG/Grid/Battery is only applicable for a small range of electrical loads and the off-grid DG/WT/PV is only suitable for demands less than 190 kWh/day. Extension distance directly affects the most favorable choice but as the electrical demand increase, extension distance becomes inconsequential to the choice of the optimum system. For any load demand higher than 240 kWh/day, the on-grid DG/PV/WT/Battery is the most advantageous option. Another analysis is also performed to evaluate how diesel price could change the optimum system which the result is shown in Fig. 18 (b). It is observed that the diesel fuel price has a perfectly linear association with extension distance, suggesting that both factors are of the same importance when choosing an optimal configuration. Emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants have become one of the most important features of any power production system. Fig .19 shows how different system configurations vary in terms of CO2 , SO2 , and NOx emissions. The pure DG/pure boiler produces the highest amount of emissions. Although NOx emissions of the pure grid/pure boiler are rather similar to the hybrid configurations, the CO2  emissions are almost 56% higher. Therefore, it is not possible to meaningfully reduce NOx emissions without finding alternative solutions for supplying thermal demand. The difference between a CHP hybrid and a non-CHP hybrid system's emissions is not significant since renewables aren't used directly for generating heat, but the CHP hybrid system has a definitive advantage when comparing overall performance in regards to greenhouse gas emissions.  4.7 TOPSIS results The results obtained via HOMER are based on cost optimization method, which is arguably the best single-objective method for determining the optimum structure of a hybrid renewable system. However, the downside here is that other system features, such as renewable fraction, can only be controlled by constraints, but cannot be optimized along with costs. TOPIS offers a simple way of fixing this deficiency by allowing us to not only set multiple criterions for choosing the optimum system, but also giving different weights to each objective. After analyzing different economic, technical, and environmental aspects of HOMER results and knowing the importance of each criterion, the multi-criteria decision-making can be done. Four categories are considered for criteria classification and Each category contains various criteria as stated in Table 12  . The evaluations of alternatives are determined based on HOMER results. These numbers will be inserted into the TOPSIS implementation in MATLAB as X   (decision matrix). It should be noted that the last column determines the positive or negative effects of criteria on the alternatives optimality. According to Table 12 , any configuration containing a diesel generator is producing 2 to 3 times the emission of those without it, making these systems less desirable when it comes to the environmental category, which is the highest-weighted SDG criteria (47 for priority weighing and 6 for equal weighing),. The economic factors, the second criteria in terms of weight (46 and 4), naturally yield the same results as HOMER's cost optimization. As for energy security, third with regards to weight (33 and 4), the systems without diesel are again better in relation to diesel dependency, but then need more natural gas as a result, leading to a lower NGD score. The most diverse system is the same as the HOMER optimum, utilizing all five technologies. The last category is technical with the lowest weights (26 and 3), where the completely renewable systems perform better in connection with extra electricity and renewable fraction, but are less effective when it comes to curbing excess thermal energy as they only use a single technology, boiler, for supplying heat. Table 13   indicates the overall TOPSIS performance score of systems based on three weighting methods explained in sub-section 3.3 . In the equal weighting method, the PV/WT/DG/Boiler/Battery (BAT) system has the best performance but when the SDGs are considered, the PV/WT/BAT/Boiler has the best performance. In essence, paying attention to SDGs eliminates the DG from the final result and encourages the maximum use of renewable energy despite the high price of renewables compared to fossil fuels. Another interesting point is that although the PV/WT/DG/BAT/Boiler configuration is still the best choice when all the objectives are given equal weight, it is followed immediately by the PV/WT/BAT/Boiler, indicating that even without SDG priority weighing, this configuration is an overall advantageous option. Fig. 20   shows the performance scores bar chart. The lowest scored system throughout all three weighing methods is the DG/BAT/Boiler, the fourth choice by HOMER, followed by PV/DG/BAT/Boiler, the second choice by HOMER, when comparing overall score of all three columns. This demonstrates that cost optimization, albeit a very strong method for picking the best configuration, could potentially be misleading when it comes to ranking different systems if other important factors in today's energy sector such as environmental features are overlooked. In conclusion, TOPSIS offers a more holistic view of each scenario's upsides and downsides, letting users make a more informed decisions based on the needs of their systems.   5 Conclusion The current study focuses on investigating a hybrid renewable energy solution for supplying combined heat and power to rural societies with the outstanding climate of West Asia as a less noticed kind of energy system. As a key factor the potential of HOMER software to be improved by MCDM methods are analyzed. For the first time a SDG-17 based criteria weighting method were developed to minimizing human intervention in the direct determination of weights. Then the result of economic optimization by HOMER software is compared with the results of integrated HOMER/TOPSIS to determine the effect of considering sustainable development goals on the HRES optimization. The sensitivity analysis and global SDG-based methodology ensure the results are not inclusive of the present case study, but can also be adapted for other similar circumstances.• From the economic point of view, the optimum hybrid plant includes 6 ×   1.5 kW wind turbines, 7.5 kW PV, a 10-kW diesel generator, and 21 kWh batteries with a COE of 0.143 $/kWh can be an affordable option for any mini-rural region located further than 6.4 km from grid transmission lines.  • Compared to a pure-diesel strategy for electricity production and a pure-boiler strategy for heat production, the CHP hybrid system raises emission profits by 70% and 20%, respectively.  • The sensitivity analysis with the COE range of 0.120 to 0.260 $/kWh against possible variations shows the affordability of the proposed unit in tropical climates such as that of west Asia.  • Due to the direct/indirect existence of energy systems decision-making criteria in most UN sustainable development goals, weighting the criteria based on SDG-17 can create a fixed criterion according to the conditions of the study area to weight the criteria.  • By considering all SDG-17 objectives compared to only economic objectives, the COE increased by about 0.15 $/kWh while more than a 56.6% reduction in emissions and less dependency on fossil fuels were obtained.    Therefore, the results showed that moving toward SDGs minimizes fossil fuel consumption and encourages the maximum use of renewable energy. For future works, it is suggested that the results of the proposed SDG-based criteria weighting method be compared with other weighting methods such as AHP, SIMOS, or SMART. Furthermore, a comprehensive review article regarding the relationship between energy systems decision-making criteria and sustainable development goals is needed to extend the applicability of the proposed method to other parts of the world. Accurate detection of the effectiveness of each energy-related criteria in achieving UN sustainable development goals can overcome the main limitation of weight determination of decision-making criteria.
