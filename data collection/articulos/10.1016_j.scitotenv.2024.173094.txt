                  The SDG 15.3.1 target of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) only has 15 years from conception (in 2015) to realization (in 2030). Therefore, investigating the effectiveness and challenges of LDN has become a priority, especially in drylands, where fragile ecosystems intersect with multiple disturbances. In this study, solutions are proposed and validated based on the challenges of LDN. We chose the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains as a case study and set baselines in 2005 and 2010. The region and degree of land change (including degraded, stable, and improved) were depicted at the pixel scale (100 × 100 m), and LDN realization was assessed at the regional scale (including administrative districts and 5000 × 5000 m grids). The results showed a significant disparity between the two baselines. The number of areas that realized the LDN target was rare, regardless of the scale of the administrative districts or grids. Chord plots, Spearman's correlation, and curve estimation were employed to reveal the relationship between LDN and seven natural or socioeconomic factors. We found that substantial degradation was closely related to the expansion of unused, urban, and mining land and reduction in water, glaciers, and forests. Further evidence suggests that agricultural development both positively and negatively affects LDN, whereas urbanization and mining activities are undesirable for LDN. Notably, the adverse effects of glacier melting require additional attention. Therefore, we consider the easy-to-achieve and hard-to-achieve baselines as the mandatory and desirable targets of LDN, respectively, and focus further efforts in three aspects: preventing agricultural exploitation from occupying ecological resources, defining reasonable zones for urbanization and mining, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate warming. Overall, this study is expected to be a beneficial addition to existing LDN theoretical systems and serve as a case validation of the challenges of LDN in drylands.

Editor: Fernando Pacheco The SDG 15.3.1 target of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) only has 15 years from conception (in 2015) to realization (in 2030). Therefore, investigating the effectiveness and challenges of LDN has become a priority, especially in drylands, where fragile ecosystems intersect with multiple disturbances. In this study, solutions are proposed and validated based on the challenges of LDN. We chose the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains as a case study and set baselines in 2005 and 2010. The region and degree of land change (including degraded, stable, and improved) were depicted at the pixel scale (100 × 100 m), and LDN realization was assessed at the regional scale (including administrative districts and 5000 × 5000 m grids). The results showed a significant disparity between the two baselines. The number of areas that realized the LDN target was rare, regardless of the scale of the administrative districts or grids. Chord plots, Spearman's correlation, and curve estimation were employed to reveal the relationship between LDN and seven natural or socioeconomic factors. We found that substantial degradation was closely related to the expansion of unused, urban, and mining land and reduction in water, glaciers, and forests. Further evidence suggests that agricultural development both positively and negatively affects LDN, whereas urbanization and mining activities are undesirable for LDN. Notably, the adverse effects of glacier melting require additional attention. Therefore, we consider the easy-to-achieve and hard-to-achieve baselines as the mandatory and desirable targets of LDN, respectively, and focus further efforts in three aspects: preventing agricultural exploitation from occupying ecological resources, defining reasonable zones for urbanization and mining, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate warming. Overall, this study is expected to be a beneficial addition to existing LDN theoretical systems and serve as a case validation of the challenges of LDN in drylands.

Approximately 25 % and 36 % of land has already experienced substantial or moderate degradation, and this is expected to expand by 120,000 km2 /y (Constenla-Villoslada et al., 2022 ). This not only influences billions of people's livelihoods but also results in enormous economic losses, which amount to 6 trillion USD per year (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2020 ). Land degradation often stems from increasing human–land conflicts, especially in drylands (Lü et al., 2022 ). Drylands occupy approximately 40 % of the global terrestrial area, spanning 135 countries and hosting over 30 % of the global population (El-Beltagy and Madkour, 2012 ). Owing to the arid climates, fragile ecosystems, and irrational human activities, land degradation in drylands has become a widespread phenomenon and a priority in research (Ren et al., 2022 ). To curb and reverse the trend of land degradation, the Zero Net Land Degradation initiative was introduced at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio + 20) in 2012 (Stavi and Lal, 2015 ). Subsequently, in 2015, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification officially introduced and defined the concept of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) and incorporated it as target 15.3.1 in the SDGs (Meyfroidt et al., 2022 ). LDN aims to achieve a balance between land degradation and restoration through sustainable land management practices (Cowie et al., 2018 ; Gilbey et al., 2019 ). It has a limited timeframe from conception to realization of 15 years, and despite being halfway through the current period, the degree of successful LDN implementation remains uncertain, necessitating the imperative conduct of a comprehensive evaluation. LDN has attracted worldwide attention from the academic community, with numerous scholars conducting research at different scales, such as global (Gilbey et al., 2019 ; Guo, 2021 ), national (Willemen et al., 2018 ; Wunder and Bodle, 2019 ), and watershed-level (Kiani-Harchegani and Sadeghi, 2020 ; Yu et al., 2023a ). The existing literature has focused on the conceptualization, principles, and methodology of LDN (Chappell et al., 2019 ), ultimately establishing a strong scientific conceptual framework (Cowie et al., 2018 ; Debonne et al., 2021 ). Some scholars have developed monitoring methods supported by remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems to accurately assess the extent and trends of land degradation (Gonzalez-Roglich et al., 2019 ; Sims et al., 2019 ; Yu et al., 2023a ). Moreover, previous studies have revealed the effects of human activities, climate change, and land use change on land degradation, which further influence the process of LDN (Abbas et al., 2022 ; Kust et al., 2017 ). Researchers have examined various sustainable land management measures and policies to mitigate the adverse consequences of land degradation (Hemraj et al., 2024 ; Ifejika Speranza et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2021 ). Some have also focused on elucidating the correlation between LDN and SDGs and identifying the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing LDN in different regions and ecosystems (Lü et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2020 ; Yu et al., 2020 ). Considering the challenges and opportunities faced by LDN, tailored measures should be developed for different regions and ecosystems (Ptichnikov et al., 2019 ), particularly in drylands (Grainger, 2015 ). Achieving the LDN target is also an urgent matter for China, as almost 35 % of the country's lands suffer from erosion and desertification (Yu et al., 2023b ), about 90 % of its natural grasslands are degraded, and over 10 % of cultivated land has been polluted (Lyu et al., 2022 ). The geographical patterns of China's energy-endowed areas highly overlap with drylands, making it easier for land degradation to occur under the intertwining of fragile ecosystems and energy development (Xiao et al., 2020 ). The Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains (NSTM) in Xinjiang is a typical case. As a large energy base, this area has experienced large-scale mining activities and urbanization since 2005 (Chen et al., 2022a ; Yu et al., 2023c ), resulting in severe land degradation (Zhang et al., 2024 ). Therefore, promoting LDN as an action guide for ecological conservation and restoration in drylands would be valuable (Lü et al., 2022 ; Zheng et al., 2023 ), providing a specific goal to enhance the sustainability and resilience of lands in the study area, as well as other dryland regions. In 2023, Yu et al. (2023a)  proposed a multiscale LDN assessment methodology, which classified the indicator system into dominant and recessive indicators corresponding to the LDN rules of amount and quality, respectively. But several key scientific concerns remain unresolved. For example, the LDN requires temporal baselines of 5–10 y before 2015 (Li et al., 2021 ), yet this provision remains ambiguous. Against this background, this study intends to: 1) portray patterns and processes of land degradation and improvement, 2) assess LDN under different temporal baselines, and 3) reveal the relationship between LDN and different natural and socioeconomic factors. 4) Propose the mandatory and desirable targets of LDN according to different baselines. Through this research, we aim to provide a scientific basis and practical solutions for promoting sustainable land use to achieve LDN in drylands. The explanation of abbreviations employed in this study is given in Table 1  .  2 Data and methods 2.1 Study area The NSTM is located in the southern part of the Junggar Basin, China (83.42°N–91.56°N, 42.84°E–46.18°E), bordering the Tianshan Mountains to the south and the Gurbantunggut Desert to the north. It covers a total area of 1.246 × 105  km2  (Fig. 1  ). The study area consists of deserts, oases, and mountains from north to south, with grasslands and unused land accounting for approximately 1/2 and 1/3 of the area, respectively. The elevation of NSTM ranges from 225 to 5138 m, with some high mountains exceeding the snow line height (3500-3900 m), thus forming permanent glaciers. In China, there are 9035 glaciers in the Tianshan Mountains, with a glacier area of 9225 km2  and an ice storage capacity of 1011 km3 . Furthermore, this region falls within a temperate continental climate zone (Luo et al., 2010 ; Wei et al., 2021 ), with an average temperature ranging from 5.9 to 9.1 °C, average annual precipitation of 215 mm, and potential evaporation of 1210 mm. Owing to prolonged arid climatic conditions, the eco-environment of the study area is quite fragile (Sun et al., 2021 ), which severely constrains the sustainable development of its society (Wei et al., 2023 ). In China, the NSTM serves as a significant energy base and an important area for developing agriculture and animal husbandry. It is also a primary focus area under the Western Development Strategy (He et al., 2023 ). Although the NSTM occupies only 7.6 % of the total area of Xinjiang, it hosts 31 % of the population (approximately 8 million) and contributes 46 % of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (nearly 810 billion CNY) (Ge et al., 2023 ; Xu et al., 2024 ). The NSTM possesses abundant resources, such as oil, natural gas, and coal, and over 80 % of Xinjiang's heavy industries are clustered here. Due to the dual impacts of human activities and the changing climate, land degradation and significant glacier retreat are evident in this region. Therefore, it serves as an excellent case area for research on LDN.  2.2 Conceptual definition and solutions for LDN 2.2.1 Concept and challenges Although LDN appears to have a simple concept, it entails multiple requirements that could easily introduce deviations during implementation, which can be summarized into four aspects.(1) Objects of land resources maintaining ecosystem service functions (LF) and supporting food security (LE) . Objects oriented towards LDN include two categories: LF and LE (Cowie et al., 2018 ). The multifunctionality of land resources determines the correlation between LE and LF, posing certain difficulties for classification. For example, grasslands serve a dual role, both as a means of sustaining ecosystem services and as a significant space for livestock development (Jiang et al., 2024 ).  (2) Indicators of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), Net Primary Production (NPP), and SOC . The three indicators of LDN are LULC, NPP, and SOC (Sims et al., 2017 ). The indicator system is bounded and biophysical, mainly characterizing land use at the shallow surface and above and below ground. This indicates that it could be directly managed and regulated by policy-makers or land planning authorities. However, SOC collection calibers and standards have discrepancies among different regions. For example, the SOC measurement depth is 1 m in most countries in South Africa, whereas the standard of the Food and Agriculture Organization is 30 cm (Gilbey et al., 2019 ). Such differences hinder the ability to make synergistic comparisons of the overall situation of land degradation between regions, thereby limiting the extent to which the LDN globalization objective can be achieved.  (3) Rules of amount and quality . The LDN target requires that land resources should not be reduced both in amount and quality (Abbas et al., 2022 ). However, the rules of amount and quality are difficult to define in the context of the present indicators.  (4) Principles of One Out–All Out (1OAO) and Like-for-Like (LfL) . The 1OAO principle implies a decrease in any indicator, indicating the occurrence of degradation. Meanwhile, the LfL suggests that two objects cannot cancel each other out. For example, an increase in LE cannot offset a decrease in LF in the same region and vice versa. The integration of these two principles in practice requires further exploration.     2.2.2 Solution Given the above challenges, this study proposes the following solutions:(1) Defining LE and LF . Delineating these two objects requires the functional attributes of the actual land resources in the study area. Therefore, this study categorizes grasslands under both LE and LF, as shown in Fig. 2  .  (2) Modifying the indicator system . Because the focus of LE and LF is not entirely consistent, a differentiated indicator system is established in this study (Fig. 2 ). LULC, NPP, Carbon Storage (CS), and Soil Retention (SR) were selected as the LE and LF indicators. Food Production (FP) was also selected as an LF indicator. Although the indicators constructed for LDN are intrinsically related, these issues could be offset by the 1OAO principle. These indicators can be applied to conventional methods, and the reliability of the indicator system was demonstrated in the study of Yu et al. (2023a) .   (3) Using concepts of dominant–recessive to express amount–quality . The concepts of dominant and recessive were introduced (Long, 2022 ) to distinguish between the amount and quality emphasized by the LDN. In the modified indicator system, the dominant indicator, LULC, quantitatively expresses the extent of land degradation, while the recessive indicators communicate qualitative information about land degradation. The advantage of this solution is that the dominant indicators can indicate changes in the amount of LE or LF in certain regions, whereas the recessive indicators can characterize changes in the quality of different indicators applied to the 1OAO principle. By nesting the dominant and recessive indicators, the compliance of the amount and quality rules with the LDN can be assessed.  (4) Sequentially using the 1OAO and LfL principles . First, the 1OAO principle is used to identify degraded and improved areas at the pixel scale and assess individual objects for LE or LF at the regional scale. Then, the LfL principle is employed to accomplish an overall assessment of the LDN at the regional scale. The details of the approach employed for the above solutions are provided in Section 2.3  and Appendix.      2.3 Methods 2.3.1 Indicator states and trends in modified LDN models (1) Temporal baseline    Trend changes occur during certain periods and rely on at least two time points, thereby requiring the identification of a defined temporal baseline. The baseline of 2000–2015 recommended by Sims et al. (2021)  has been widely accepted. However, as a previous study by Yu et al. (2023a) , the choice of baseline requires consideration of the unique situations in different countries. A study from the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggested that the LDN required a baseline of 5–10 years prior to 2015 (Li et al., 2021 ). Because large-scale development and mining activities in the study area occurred after 2006 (Bahtebay et al., 2021 ), and minimal human activity occurred before that time, we selected 2005 and 2010 as the baselines to better fit the actual needs of the study area.(2) State and trends of the dominant indicator    The LULC is a classification indicator (e.g., grassland, cultivated land, or forest) rather than a numerical one. Therefore, it can be assigned by applying a hierarchy to the default transition matrix of the Trending Earth tool (Sims et al., 2017 ), wherein the quantization of the LULC can be divided into different classes to determine its status. Specifically, construction land, unused land, cultivated land, grassland, forest, and waterbody and wetland were assigned values ranging from 1 to 6, respectively. The six LULC classifications can be further classified into 30 possible types of transformations using the transfer matrix, which could then be differentiated into improved, stabilized, and degraded areas. Details of this methodology can be found in our previous study (Yu et al., 2023a ).(3) States and trends of recessive indicators    The states of NPP, CS, SR, and FP were measured using widely adopted methods. ①The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) was applied to evaluate NPP, with the detailed technical process shown in Appendix A. ②The CS module of the InVEST 3.7.0 was used to evaluate the CS supply, as described in detail in Appendix B1. ③The sediment delivery module of the InVEST 3.7.0 was employed to assess the SR, as illustrated in detail in Appendix B2. ④LF encompasses land resources that produce not only grains but also other foods. However, previous studies measured food by considering only wheat, cereals, and corn (Liu et al., 2024 ; Yin et al., 2023a ), which narrowed the concept of food to grains and ignored other food supplies. Hence, food is divided into two types based on the study area: Food A (grains, vegetables, oils, and fruits) and Food B (meat and milk), which are detailed in Appendix B3. The Theil–Sen median estimator (Sen) is a robust nonparametric statistical method for trend calculation, whereas the Mann-Kendall test (MK) is a nonparametric method for testing long-term time series trends (Chen et al., 2022b ). The combination of the two approaches enables an effective assessment of trends for ecological indicators to be integrated with their significance, which is well suited for analyzing long-term series changes (Huang et al., 2023 ; Wan et al., 2023 ). Hence, we used Sen combined with MK to calculate the trends and significance of the recessive indicators from 2005 to 2020. These steps were realized using the MATLAB R2021b software, with the running code shown in Appendix C.  2.3.2 Pixel scale of spatiotemporal land degradation and improvement patterns (1) Regional identification of land degradation and improvement    Because different elements of the ecosystem are interconnected (Hecht and Crowley, 2020 ), the dominant indicator might be co-linear or partially correlated with recessive indicators instead of being completely independent of each other (Yu et al., 2023a ). However, the presence of a single indicator of degradation may also lead to a sequence of risks associated with the degradation of other elements or indicators. For example, the conversion of LULC from forest to grassland is often accompanied by changes in the NPP. Thus, we characterized the evolution of the indicators using the 1OAO principle, in which any decrease in any one of them implies the onset of degradation. This technique is illustrated in Fig. 3  .(2) Degree of land degradation or improvement by vectors    Considering that the indicators are equally important under the 1OAO principle (Arroyo et al., 2022 ), no further weighting was required. Hence, the variation of different indicators was standardized to the interval [−1,1]. Each indicator then formed a separate one-dimensional linear space. From a combination of different indicators, these vectors further formed a multidimensional space perpendicular to each other. Finally, a vector-based ensemble bias algorithm was employed to measure the degree of degradation (L D   ) and degree of improvement (L I   ). If ∃ x ∈ ∆ i 1   ∆ i 2   … ∆ i n     < 0  , then L D    was calculated according to Eq. (1) ; otherwise L I    was calculated according to Eq. (2) .(1) L D  = min ∆ i 1   0  2  + min ∆ i 2   0  2  + … + min ∆ i n   0  2       (2) L I  = ∆ i 1  2  + ∆ i 2  2  + … + ∆ i n  2       where i 1   ，i 2   ，……i n    denote the values of the LDN indicators and ∆   denotes the change in the value of an indicator over a specific period, with n  = 4 for LE and n  = 5 for LF. The significance of L D    and L I    was determined using an F-test. We combined the results of the L D    and L I    integrated with F-tests to provide a degree of classification of land degradation and improvement, as shown in Table 2 .  Notably, these steps were not only be utilized for assessing the degree of land degradation and improvement at the pixel scale but also for composing the LDN index at the grid scale for subsequent assessment of correlation with different factors.(3) Hotspot analysis    Hotspot analysis is based on null hypothesis testing, which is commonly employed in statistical inference (Ijumulana et al., 2020 ). High-value elements are often noticeable, but might not be statistically significant hotspots. Therefore, elements should be both high-value on their own and surrounded by other high-value elements for the hotspot to be considered statistically significant (Tantipisanuh and Gale, 2022 ). Hot spots and cold spots were recognized using the Getis-Ord Gi* tool of ArcGIS 10.6. Hot spots indicate improved areas and cold spots indicate degraded areas.  2.3.3 Regional and grid scale of LDN realization assessment The LDN emphasizes specific region-wide achievements, rather than on a particular pixel (Cowie et al., 2018 ). So, quantitative and qualitative compliance with the LDN can be determined separately using dominant and recessive indicators for two types of objects in a certain region. We assessed the objects at the scale of the entire study area, different administrative districts, and grids to make a judgment on the fit of the LDN. The changes in the respective areas of LE and LF were considered as quantitative gaps in the LDN (as shown in Eqs. (3) and (4) ), whereas the cumulative changes in the recessive indicators corresponding to each pixel were regarded as qualitative gaps (as shown in Eqs. (5) and (6) ).(3) ∆ X LE  = A pixel  × Count X LE  t n     − Count X LE  t 0          (4) ∆ X LF  = A pixel  × Count X LF  t n     − Count X LF  t 0          (5) ∆ Y LE  = min ∫ Y 1 LE  t n    − ∫ Y 1 LE   t 0      ∫ Y 2 L E  t n    − ∫ Y 2 LE   t 0      ∫ Y 3 LE  t n    − ∫ Y 3 LE   t 0          (6) ∆ Y LF  = min ∫ Y 1  LF  t n    − ∫ Y 1  LF  t 0     ∫ Y 2  LF  tn   − ∫ Y 2 LF  t 0     ∫ Y 3  LF  t n    − ∫ Y 3  LF  t 0     ∫ Y 4 LF  t n    − ∫ Y 4  LF  t 0          where Count     represents the number of pixels, A pixel    indicates the area of each pixel, t 0    and t n    refer to the initial and final time points, respectively, X   denotes the dominant indicator, Y 1   , Y 2   , Y 3   , and Y 4    indicate the recessive indicators of LDN, and ∫     expresses the cumulative value of the recessive indicators for all pixels in a certain period. When neither Eq. (3)  nor 4 is less than zero, the LE satisfies the LDN. Similarly, when both Eqs. (5) and (6)  are not less than zero, LF satisfies the LDN. The LE and LF results were then combined and superimposed, following the LfL principle. If ∀ ∆ X LE   ∆ Y LE   ∆ X LF   ∆ Y LF    < 0  , then the LDN was not achieved, otherwise the LDN was achieved.  2.3.4 Relationship between LDN and different factors (1) Land use and the degree of land degradation or improvement    As the dominant indicators, the inflow and outflow of land use were closely related to the results of the LDN (Du et al., 2024 ), but further evidence is needed to reveal their relationship with land degradation and improvement. Thus, we matched the areas of land use inflow, outflow, and maintenance with the degree of land degradation and improvement to form a chord diagram, thereby allowing the qualitative judgment of their relationship. This also provided a basis for the subsequent quantitative revelation of the relationship, especially factor selection. The Chordal Graph was created using Hiplot Pro (https://hiplot.com.cn/ ), a comprehensive web service for biomedical data analysis and visualization (Li et al., 2022 ).(2) Spearman's coefficient    As a non-parametric indicator, the Spearman correlation coefficient can be used to measure the monotonic relationship between two variables. Compared with the Pearson correlation coefficient, the Spearman correlation coefficient is more robust in handling outliers (van den Heuvel and Zhan, 2022 ), and is widely employed in geography and ecology (Li and Luo, 2023 ). Thus, we utilized this method to detect the correlation between LDN and other factors (such as agricultural production, urbanization, and mining) using SPSS 13.0. The Spearman correlation coefficient range is [−1 to 1], with values closer to 1 or − 1 indicating a stronger monotonic relationship between the two variables, which represent positive and negative correlations, respectively. A 0 indicates that no monotonic relationship exists between the two variables.(3) Curve Estimation    The relationship between LDN and other factors is complex and may exhibit linear, inverted U-shaped, or S-shaped relationships (Wang et al., 2019 ). Thus, we applied curve estimation to identify the relationship between the LDN index and various factors at the grid scale using SPSS 13.0. Relationships between the LDN index and agricultural production, urbanization, mining, glacier melting, precipitation, GDP density, and population density were revealed.   2.4 Data source and pre-processing The data used in this study included: (1) LULC, NDVI, temperature, precipitation, and Digital Elevation Model data derived from the Resource and Environmental Science Data Center (https://www.resdc.cn/Default.aspx ); (2) potential evapotranspiration data derived from the Global Aridity and Potential Evapotranspiration Database (https://csidotinfo.wordpress.com/data/global-aridity-and-pet-database/ ); (3) food production (including grains, vegetables, oils, fruits, meat, and milk) and GDP data obtained from statistical yearbooks and the Statistical Communique of National Economic and Social Development. The spatialization of the statistical yearbook data was corrected using DMSP-OLS nightlight data, using the method employed in a previous study (Yin et al., 2023a ). The details and uses of all the data are reported in Table D1 of Appendix D. Because the temporal scale spans from 2005 to 2020, the data we selected also fit this period. LDN must be realized within a specific regional scale, and thus should be evaluated at the pixel and regional scales. For the pixel scale, pre-processing of remote sensing data could be realized with the help of ENVI 5.3 software. Furthermore, some data such as land use/land cover (with a spatial resolution of 30 m), MODIS NDVI data (with a resolution of 1 km), soil property (with a resolution of 1 km), GDP density (with a resolution of 1 km), could be converted into a unified projection coordinate system (WGS 1984), and resampled to a spatial resolution of 100 m using ArcGIS 10.6 software. Meanwhile, both the grid and administrative districts should be included on a regional scale. Administrative districts mainly refer to county-level administrative units, but Urumqi was assessed using the city level due to the food data statistics originating from the city level, and its area being similar to that of other counties. Hence, the total number of administrative districts was 14. The grid scale was divided into 5223 grids (5000 × 5000 m) utilizing the Create Fishing Grid tool of ArcGIS 10.6.   3 Results 3.1 Spatiotemporal pattern of LDN indicators As the dominant indicator, the LULC of the NSTM exhibited a north–south gradient pattern of divergence, with glaciers, forests, grasslands, construction land, cultivated land, and unused land ranking from south to north (Fig. E1 in Appendix E). The LULC changed significantly during the study period (Table 3  ). Among them, unused land and grassland were the major types, with the sum of their areas reaching approximately 80 %. Cultivated land increased from 12.4 % to 17.0 %, and built-up land increased from 1.3 % to 2.4 %, which demonstrated the excellent achievements of agricultural development and urban construction during 2005–2020. Undeniably, forests, water, and wetlands decreased with varying magnitudes. From a temporal perspective (Fig. 4  ), land use change in 2005–2020 was more active than that in 2010–2020, both in terms of region expansion and reduction. Furthermore, the areas of the LULC classifications that decreased in 2005–2020 were greater than those of the classifications that increased, while the opposite was true in 2010–2020. The four recessive indicators exhibited divergent spatiotemporal patterns, as shown in Fig. E2 in in Appendix E, Table 4  , and Fig. 5  . 1) The high value area of the NPP was concentrated in the south, exhibiting improvements during both 2005–2020 and 2010–2020. 2) The high value areas of the CS were clustered in the central and western regions, but there was a net decrease in both periods. 3) For the SR, it was generally lower, except for that in the south. The area of decrease was greater than the area of increase during 2005–2020, but both areas were similar during 2010–2020. 4)There was a net increase in 2005–2020, but the opposite was observed in 2010–2020, indicating a reduction in the food security function. Remarkably, the food supply function of livestock grazing was essentially equal to that of cultivated land, which corroborates the importance of including grasslands in securing LF.  3.2 Identification of degraded and improved areas and their hot/cold spots In terms of the type identification (Fig. 6 a ), the degraded and improved areas were almost identical in 2005–2020, but degraded area exceeded the improved area in 2010–2020. Overall, the degraded and improved areas in 2010–2020 were considerably lower than those of 2005–2020, which also revealed significant differences in the results by different baselines. In 2005–2020, the area of dominant degraded but not recessive degraded was the largest, followed by the area where only recessive improved but dominant stable occurred (Fig. 6a3). Moreover, areas with both dominant and recessive degradation were concentrated in the glacial in the southwest of the NSTM as well as the construction land in Urumqi. In 2010–2020, recessive degradation was common, with a continuous distribution in the central part of the study area. In terms of the degree classification (Fig. 6 b), the degraded area was higher during 2005–2020 than 2010–2020. Moreover, the area of degradation was larger than that of improvement during both periods, with both slight improvement and degradation prevailing. Moreover, the total area with different degrees of degradation (Fig. 6 b) was slightly higher than the degraded areas superimposed by each type (Fig. 6 a), which needs to be further discussed. The cold and hot spots in both periods were significant at the 99 % level (Fig. 6 c). However, the cold and hot spots in 2005–2020 were greater than those in 2010–2020, with significant differences in the spatial patterns. Improved hotspots during 2005–2020 were more sporadically distributed, whereas degraded cold spots were mainly dispersed in the southwestern and northern parts of the study area.  3.3 Assessment of LDN results 3.3.1 Single-object assessment following the one out-all out (1OAO) principle The achievement of qualitative and quantitative LDN was assessed separately using dominant and recessive indicators following the division of LE and LF. These were accomplished at the administrative district and grid scales, respectively. The results of the analysis from a single perspective of amount or quality were presented in Fig. E3 and Tables E1–E2 in Appendix E. When the dominant–recessive indicators overlapped, fewer units were both amount and quality compliant with LDN, as shown in Fig. 7   and Table E3 in Appendix E. 1) At the administrative district scale, the achievement rate for 2005–2020 was lower than that for 2010–2020, in which LE was 14.29 % and 35.71 %, respectively, and LF was 21.43 % and 28.57 %, respectively. 2) At the grid scale, the achievement rate of the LE was 14.05 % in 2005–2020, as well as 18.57 % in 2010–2020. In contrast, the achievement rate of the LF was 28.99 % and 13.63 % in 2005–2020 and 2010–2020, respectively.  3.3.2 Dual-object assessment following the like for like (LfL) principle At the administrative district scale (Fig. 8 a  and Table E4 in Appendix E), most units suffered from land degradation of both LF and LE, and this percentage reached 78.57 % in 2005–2020. Of these, only two units realized LDN during 2005–2020: NA + EA in Kelamayi and EA + EA in Shihezi. Notably, only Klamath achieved LDN in 2010–2020, but this dropped to NA + NA. At the grid scale (Fig. 8 b and Table E4 in Appendix E), only about 15 % of all grids have realized LDN. Even discounting the grids without LE or LF (16.81 % to 24.20 %), the proportion of land degradation was alarmingly high. Furthermore, the grids with dual AO of LE and LF continuously existed in the study area, occupying a weight of 45.01 % ∼ 49.11 % among all grids, thus indicating that strenuous efforts would continue to achieve LDN in the future.   3.4 Relationship analysis of LDN with different factors 3.4.1 Land use flow and land degradation and improvement degree The areas of land use flow (Fig. E4 in Appendix E) were matched with the degree of land change degree (Fig. 6 b) in the corresponding periods and a chord diagram was formed. The results are presented in Fig. 9  . As Fig. 9 a1–a2 shows, mild and moderate improvements were closely associated with inflows from grassland, forest, and cultivated land, whereas substantial improvements were mainly linked to inflows from water and cultivated land. In 2005–2020, the inflow of unused land accounted for the highest proportion of different degrees of land degradation. However, from 2010 to 2020, grassland inflows were most closely associated with substantial degradation. The inflow of construction and mining land also entails substantial and moderate degradation. Thus, under different baselines, land use inflows were variably related to the degradation degree but similarly related to the improvement degree. Unlike inflows, the relationship between land use outflows and land change degree, whether degradation or improvement, varied considerably over two baselines (Fig. 9 b1–b2). In 2005–2020, regardless of moderate or substantial degradation, the outflow of the glaciers should not be ignored. Furthermore, the outflow of unused land mainly contributed to land improvement, especially mild improvement. In 2010–2020, the outflow of cultivated land was gradually associated with substantial and moderate degradation. In both baselines, the outflow of grassland was an essential contributor to both mild and moderate degradation as well as moderate and substantial improvement. As shown in Fig. E4 in Appendix E, the majority of land use types were unchanged in the study area. These land use types have also been degraded or improved, indicating the occurrence of recessive changes (Fig. 9 c1–c2). For regions without land use change, the degradation or improvement of cultivated land was the most pronounced, followed by grassland. Thus, both grassland and cultivated land were main sources of quality change under different baselines.  3.4.2 LDN and different factors Following Section 3.4.1 , we selected several possible factors, namely agricultural production, urbanization, mining, melting glaciers, precipitation, economic development, and population density. The quantitative results of these seven factors were regressed with the LDN index and the results are shown in Fig. 10  . Urbanization, as a dynamic process of population concentration from rural to urban, is intertwined with economic development. As urbanization, economic development, and population density were correlated, their relationships with the LDN index were analogous. That is, all three factors hinder the realization of LDN. Urbanization was negatively correlated with both LE and LF but better fit into a univariate linear relationship with LE and a bivariate linear relationship with LF. In contrast, economic development and population density showed negative logarithmic relationships with LDN; however, their R2  and SpC values were generally lower. Both mining and agriculture are important industries in the NSTM. For mining activities, the impact on ecology and agriculture is a subject of great concern. The results revealed that it has a negative logarithmic relationship with LDN, with higher R2  and SpC values for LE than LF. Thus, the negative effect of mining on the ecology of this region is stronger than that on agriculture. For agriculture activities, cultivated land positively affected the food production of LDN, but a higher share of cultivated lands was not better within the grid. Instead, it may stagnate or even decrease with an increase in the share of cultivated land. Moreover, it had a significant negative univariate linear relationship with the maintenance of the ecosystem services function, with R2  and SpC being even higher than the effect on the food production function. Changes in the natural environment were also closely related to LDN. On the one hand, the melting glaciers showed a simple negative linearity with LDN in both LE and LF. The relationships were reflected in an extremely significant negative correlation with LE (P  < 0.01) and a significant negative correlation with LF (P  < 0.05). On the other hand, precipitation has a significantly positive linear logarithmic relation with the LDN index. However, drought is a widespread phenomenon in this region, resulting in low R2  and SpC values.    4 Discussion 4.1 Assessment of LDN Based on the results of this study, we focused on three aspects of LDN measurements.(1) The validity of the methodology for LDN assessment employed in this study was discussed in our previous study (Yu et al., 2023a ). Moreover, the identified results are fundamentally consistent with the trends of a previous large-scale study (Guo, 2021 ). Therefore, this method offers two advantages. First, regardless of the indicators chosen in land degradation studies, cases of collinearity or partial correlation may occur (Sims et al., 2019 ). However, this deficiency could be effectively remedied by the 1OAO principle. That is, degradation would be judged as long as one of the indicators fails to meet the criteria (Cowie et al., 2018 ), regardless of the collinearity or partial correlation between the different indicators. Second, the total areas of the different degrees of degradation (Fig. 6 b) were slightly higher than the degraded areas superimposed by each type (Fig. 6 a). After verification, these extra areas were all mild degradation, with insignificant decline observed in each individual indicator. But such a result was quite probable and reasonable when multiple indicators were superimposed.  (2) Multiplicity is an inherent property of land resources that can be described as multifunctional (Wang et al., 2023a ). The LDN criteria emphasized the LfL principle of non-counterbalance between land resources for food security and ecosystem services (Cowie et al., 2018 ), but neither has been defined in detail. This is a challenging endeavor, with a starting point firmly grounded in practical considerations. The NSTM serves as both a key agricultural and livestock base, as well as an important ecological barrier in China (Yu et al., 2023c ), and grasslands serve both functions, as emphasized by the LDN. This has been reported in several previous studies (Shikur, 2023 ; Xu et al., 2023 ; Yin et al., 2023b ). Therefore, a grid -scale analysis was also included. The results revealed that realization at the grid scale was indeed more difficult, yet increasingly clarified which regions would require strenuous effort to realize LDN.  (3) Temporal baselines of LDN were recommended for a land status of 5–10 years prior to 2015 (Li et al., 2021 ). This starting point might be good for accommodating equity concerns for different countries and regions while also enabling some flexibility to achieve the LDN goals (Arroyo et al., 2022 ). Nevertheless, this ambiguity increases the difficulty of realizing LDN in various regions. For example, this study found striking disparities between 2005 and 2015 as the temporal baseline, regardless of the degree of degradation or LDN measure. If such ambiguous baselines were continued, a simpler standard would be preferred over a harder standard of realization (Yu et al., 2023a ). Consequently, this ambiguous reference system provides advantages, but probably renders the LDN target much less desirable, which should be cautioned against.     4.2 Challenges of realizing LDN Different factors have different relationships with LDN, and negatively correlated factors could be regarded as challenges to some extent.(1) Agriculture has both positive and negative effects on LDN, with enhanced food security and negative ecological impacts (Du et al., 2024 ). This might have been a serious challenge of the originally expected ecological restoration, as confirmed in a previous study (Kong et al., 2023 ). Moreover, prolonged agricultural activities, especially lack of crop rotation and fallow, could cause the soil's ability to retain water and fertilizers to decline(Hai et al., 2020 ), resulting in increased land degradation. Similarly, when overgrazing occurred, livestock would overfeed on herbaceous plants, leading to a rapid decrease in the good forage species and further aggravate grassland degradation (Jiang et al., 2024 ).  (2) Urbanization was quadratically negatively correlated with the LDN fit of the LF, with this trend decreasing as the proportion of construction land increased. Normally, urbanization occurs at the expense of peri-urban farmland, particularly during the initial construction period (Qu et al., 2024 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). However, in terms of R2  and SpC, this effect was not very intense, especially during 2010–2020. Food security can be realized through yield improvement using improved technologies (Chen et al., 2023a ). As previous literature indicates that rational urbanization in semi-arid regions does not impede food security, this might also be applicable to drylands (Li et al., 2023 ).  (3) Mining activities have significant effects on ecology and agriculture (Ma et al., 2024 ). This study observed that the negative effect of mining on ecology was stronger than agriculture; however, both R2  values were low. This result can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, mining activities in this study area were generally open-pit (Jiang et al., 2024 ; Yu et al., 2021 ), with rarely any conflict between underground mining and surface agriculture. On the other hand, some mining activities also occupy the LE, but land degradation tended to cluster in newly added mining areas. Moreover, owing to the implementation of land reclamation and ecological restoration (Wang et al., 2021 ), land tended to improve in some mining areas.  (4) Glacier melting is an important manifestation of climate change (Thapliyal et al., 2023 ) and hinders the realization of LDNs, especially for LE. This indicates that warming is a serious challenge for LDN in drylands. Previously, warming and humidification were considered beneficial to the ecological improvement of drylands (Naeem et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ), yet this understanding might be one-sided. Indeed, runoff from melting glaciers can nourish the land, which, to some extent, creates a suitable environment for vegetation (Stevens et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, overdraft glacial meltwater appears to offer short-term improvements to ecosystems. However, from a long-term perspective, it would exacerbate water scarcity, increase bare land (Yang et al., 2020 ), threaten ecosystem balance (Wei et al., 2021 ), and even increase the frequency of extreme climatic events (Pritchard, 2019 ), such as high temperatures, droughts, and floods.     4.3 Policy implications (1) Reasonable ranges of exploitation intensity are necessary for urbanization and mining in drylands. Thus, urbanization occupying high-quality cultivated land (Qu et al., 2024 ) and the occurrence of substantial or moderate land degradation must be prevented. The allocation of resources inside urban agglomerations must be optimized to promote high-quality economic development and ensure the realization of the LDN target. Moreover, under the global appeal of prioritizing ecological protection (Hemraj et al., 2024 ), the role of ecological restoration continues to be negligible (Wang et al., 2023b ), particularly for mine ecological restoration (Ma et al., 2024 ). In this study, although mining activities were mostly located in the desert, effective ecological restoration measures could reverse land degradation, which may make complementary contributions to the LDN target.  (2) Promoting the green development of agriculture and livestock is crucial for achieving LDN in drylands (Debonne et al., 2021 ). Water-saving irrigation techniques and prioritization of drought-tolerant crop species are recommended to mitigate the reliance on manual irrigation and reduce the land degradation risk (Yin et al., 2023c ). Agricultural development in the drylands should reduce the occupation of the LF by following the LfL principle. In addition, promoting proper farming practices, such as conservation tillage and cultivated land fallow, is crucial (Chen et al., 2023b ). These measures would be helpful in maintaining a balance between soil moisture and nutrients, thereby reducing the occurrence of soil erosion and salinization. Finally, scientific livestock management can help maintain the health and balance of grasslands.  (3) Under arid climatic conditions, land degradation occurs easily (Grainger, 2015 ; Xiao et al., 2020 ), with particular sensitivity to climate change (Roy et al., 2023 ; Yao et al., 2019 ). Thus, LDN should be synergized with Carbon Neutrality. Considering the correlation between carbon emissions and climate change, we recommended climate mitigation measures to reduce industrial activities with high carbon emissions, like attempting to constrain mining development or the expansion of urban areas. Moreover, effective climate adaptation measures should also be adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. This would be a common global endeavor, rather than the responsibility of a particular region.    Overall, we recommend a comprehensive examination and comparison of temporal baselines for the 5–10 years prior to 2015. Baselines that were easier and more difficult to achieve were considered mandatory and desirable targets, respectively. On this basis, the LDN can be integrated into the broader framework of sustainable land management (Fig. 11  ). Policymakers can incorporate different LDN targets into policies, strategies, and plans at the national and regional levels. A mandatory target can be regarded as a criterion for establishing a threshold effect. For areas failing to achieve the bottom-line target, land users must be urged to rectify the situation and penalized if they fail to meet it. If desirable targets are achieved, incentives such as ecological compensation can be provided to land users.   5 Conclusion and future outlook Because LDN has become a common global concern, a scientific understanding of its effectiveness and challenges is crucial. In this study, marginal contributions were made to address this. We confirmed that drylands were indeed key areas that constrained the realization of LDN, and deserve greater efforts in the future. Of these, substantial degradation is closely related to the inflow of unused, construction, and mining lands, as well as the outflow of water, glaciers, and forests. The degradation or improvement of cultivated land and grasslands is closely related to changes in their quality. Further evidence indicates that agricultural development enhances food security, but negatively affects ecosystem services and functions. Mining activities in deserts and moderate urbanization would not radically hinder LDN goals, but melting glaciers would significantly impede the realization of LDN. Finally, ambiguous temporal baselines would complicate the implementation of LDN; therefore, we propose temporal baselines that are desirable and mandatory. This study had three limitations. First, although LDN is concerned with the regulation of key natural resources and ecological assets, the position of deserts makes it difficult to reflect their valuable role under this framework. If desert ecosystems were further integrated into LE, the sum of LE and LF would equal the NSTM's area minus construction and mining land. In this instance, neither the number of LE nor LF was reduced, one of the LDN rules, would be difficult to realize. Second, because multiple supplies of food originate from different land types, this study considered the food production of grasslands but neglected rivers and lakes. This was a compromise because of data constraints and low aquatic products in drylands. Consequently, the food production results would also be slightly lower than in reality. Third, the realization of LDN involves the joint efforts of different countries in a global context as well as the synergistic efforts of different regions in a particular country. However, owing to regional differences, the applicability of scale divisions, indicator systems, and data selection requires further research. Thus, the possible transboundary effects of LDN also deserve to be a direction of further attention in the future. The theoretical framework of the LDN with LULC, NPP, and SOC as indicator systems is well established and widely accepted. Thus, this study did not intend to alter them or reconstruct a new theory, but rather slightly modify the LDN based on realistic considerations to make beneficial additions (e.g., reveal the challenges and propose the different targets of LDN) to this theoretical system. We can expect that the road to realizing LDN will be challenging; therefore, the joint efforts of all sectors of society, including, but not limited to, scholars, government officials, and the public, are necessary.
