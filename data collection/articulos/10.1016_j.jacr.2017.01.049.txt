                  The 2016 RAD-AID Conference analyzed the accelerated global activity in the radiology community that is transforming medical imaging into an effective spearhead of health care capacity building in low- and middle-income countries. Global health efforts historically emphasized disaster response, crisis zones, and infectious disease outbreaks. However, the projected doubling of cancer and cardiovascular deaths in developing countries in the next 15 years and the need for higher technology screening and diagnostic technologies in low-resource regions, as articulated by the United Nations’ new Sustainable Development Goals of 2016, is heightening the role of radiology in global health. Academic US-based radiology programs with RAD-AID chapters achieved a threefold increase in global health project offerings for trainees in the past 5 years. RAD-AID’s nonprofit radiology volunteer corps continue to grow by more than 40% yearly, with a volunteer base of 5,750 radiology professionals, serving in 23 countries, donating close to 20,000 pro bono hours globally in 2016. As a high-technology specialty interfacing with nearly all medical and surgical disciplines, radiology underpins vital health technology infrastructure, such as digital imaging archives, electronic medical records, and advanced diagnosis and treatment, essential for long-term future health care capacity in underserved areas of the world.

RAD-AID International 8004 Ellingson Drive Chevy Chase MD 20815    The 2016 RAD-AID Conference analyzed the accelerated global activity in the radiology community that is transforming medical imaging into an effective spearhead of health care capacity building in low- and middle-income countries.

Key Words Radiology  developing countries  public health  residency education  international global imaging  economic development  artificial intelligence  PACS  sustainable development goals  technologists  radiology outreach  radiologic nursing    Introduction Approximately 15 years ago, fewer than 10% of radiology residency programs offered global health outreach training [1-3] . By the end of 2016, 53 US-based academic medical centers had created or operated RAD-AID chapters for global outreach projects and radiology capacity building in 23 medically underserved countries (Fig. 1  ). This growth achieves an approximate 300% increase in the number of ACGME-accredited institutions offering global health radiology training in the past 5 years. In 2016, RAD-AID’s volunteer base grew by 41% to exceed 5,750 radiology professionals, producing a recorded annual contribution of 19,855 volunteer hours to RAD-AID in support of radiology development in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This accelerated global activity in the radiology community is transforming medical imaging into an effective spearhead of health care capacity building in poor and developing countries. With more than half the world lacking vital radiology resources [4,5] , the challenges to this progress are still substantial, but current trends suggest a hopeful outlook for radiology’s growing role in transforming resource-poor health care environments. In this article we examine those trends, challenges, and strategic choices as a path for building global radiology capacity in poor regions, on the basis of the presentations and discussions at the 8th Annual RAD-AID Conference at the Pan American Health Organization World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) in November 2016. Specific themes for these challenges and opportunities include (1) defining radiology’s role in the United Nations’ (UN) newly declared Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), (2) formulating productive parameters for global health training in radiology residencies, (3) integrating technology innovation with adoption of conventionally accepted clinically proven radiology techniques to empower low-resource regions, (4) constructively responding to the proliferation of ultrasound among nonradiology personnel in LMICs, and (5) addressing the widespread lack of PACS, broadband, and radiologic IT, the absence of which greatly limits radiology quality and reduces the short-term feasibility of teleradiology and artificial intelligence (AI) applications in resource-scarce contexts.  Economics, Public Health, and Radiology: The UN’s SDGs From 2000 to 2015, the UN adopted and pursued the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which contributed to several important milestones, such as a drop in extreme global poverty (living on less than $1.25 per day) from 50% of the world’s population in 2000 to 14% in 2015, a 50% decrease in the mortality of children under age 5, and a 45% decrease in maternal mortality [6] . To follow the MDGs with a new set of global objectives, the UN recently adopted the SDGs, which is a set of 17 aims to be pursued from 2016 to 2030 [7] . Several SDGs are clearly affected by radiology, including (1) good health and well-being, (2) quality education, (3) decent work and economic growth, (4) industry innovation and infrastructure, and (5) partnerships for the goals, because of the following respective reasons: (1) radiology is central to health services, (2) radiology outreach imparts significant education and knowledge transfers for workforce development, (3) imaging technologies and services are interdependent with economic growth, (4) radiology is an anchor for technology innovation and high-technology health infrastructure such as IT and equipment, and (5) radiology’s pertinence to most medical specialties and health care sectors reinforce the vitality of partnerships across the public and private sectors. For example, one key health metric emphasized in the SDGs is noncommunicable diseases, including the prioritized prevention and treatment of cancer and cardiovascular deaths. MDGs historically emphasized communicable diseases, and SDGs are adding greater emphasis to the noncommunicable disease categories. Africa’s cancer rates are projected to double by 2030 [8,9]  with substantially lower cancer survival rates in LMICs in comparison with high-income countries [10] , while cancer deaths have decreased by 25% in the United States from 1991 to 2014 [11] . The overall 5-year survival of breast cancer in the United States is 90%, compared with less than 50% survival for patients with breast cancer in Gambia, Algeria, and Uganda, because of later stage diagnosis and fewer available treatment options [8,12] . The SDGs’ emphasis on prevention and early detection of cancer will likely mobilize resources for community education, awareness building, lifestyle changes, and vaccinations. Additionally, the SDGs’ focus on noncommunicable diseases will stir radiology capacity building because most oncologic and cardiovascular care pathways require imaging. Given the complexity of oncologic care, ranging from radiology-based screening, diagnosis, staging, and monitoring response to therapy, along with radiation therapy, surgery, and clinical management of complications, the SDGs’ emphasis on cancer control will compel a stronger commitment to radiologic service development in LMICs [13] .  Education Educational strategies for improving radiology in LMICs must balance the objective of improving on-site education of local health personnel with the aim of improving global health training for the radiology professionals conducting the outreach projects. For example, radiology residents and technologist students seeking to participate in global health outreach projects should ideally have formal training in assessment methodologies, project-planning techniques, program execution strategies, outcomes measurements, cross-cultural health care etiquette, and international health ethics. These elements, for example, are integral to the preparation of RAD-AID team members before, during, and after project trips are performed. To add further structure for these approaches, participants are given mentorship on how to perform, use, and analyze RAD-AID’s radiology readiness assessments and PACS readiness assessments. Some of these participants elect additional in-depth training, such as the RAD-AID Certificate of Proficiency in Global Health, which includes didactic topical instruction, case-based dialogues, and structured group-discussions organized around the RAD-AID textbook, Radiology in Global Health  (second edition in press, due in 2018). A growing constituency for global health radiology education is the medical students. Historically, medical students interested in global health found few educational opportunities in radiology because a very limited number of academic radiology institutions offered international outreach projects. With the growing number of RAD-AID chapters and RAD-AID’s affiliation with the World Health Organization, RAD-AID is steadily increasing opportunities for medical students. For example, RAD-AID and the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons created the first Global Health Radiology Clerkship for medical students, with the first enrollees registered for early 2017. According to this model, medical students become eligible to enter the Columbia/RAD-AID Global Health Radiology Clerkship after first completing 4 weeks of a general radiology clerkship. The students in this accredited clerkship receive didactic instruction on global health and public health topics in the first 2 weeks (such as learning how to assess radiology needs in low-resource contexts, understanding health technologies in resource-constrained health systems, analyzing the interface between poverty and disease in LMICs, and practicing cross-cultural clinical etiquette, etc). In the second 2 weeks, the medical students participate in a RAD-AID team to carry out specific on-site clinical capacity building projects in a medically underserved region. The aim is to create an educational model that may assist other medical schools throughout the United States and Canada to adopt similar radiology global health curricula for interested medical students and offer a mechanism for medical students to earn credit while performing international radiology projects. Another growing consideration is how to best structure radiology residents’ participation in global health training. Some institutions have chosen to give residents research and extracurricular time in their training schedules to allow flexibility to conduct global health projects (such as through a RAD-AID chapter project with funding from RAD-AID for team and equipment development). Some institutions have elected to pursue ACGME accreditation of overseas rotation sites. These paths are not mutually exclusive educational strategies, and both approaches can be integrated. Following are some factors for consideration that may be helpful to program directors and departmental leadership in developing residency-based global health training:■ Will the structure enable residents to have ample flexibility in choosing from a large number of country sites to optimize their educational experience on the basis of prior travel or language knowledge?  ■ Will the structure provide a sufficient range of project topic areas for residents to choose from, such as MRI protocol optimization, CT implementation, subspecialty clinical imaging (neuroradiology, interventional, musculoskeletal, women’s imaging, etc), radiation safety, rural outreach, tertiary care support, informatics and PACS, cancer care development, and so on, so that residents’ wide range of career interests can be reinforced via the global health experiences?  ■ If a country site becomes unsafe because of rapid changes in local in-country circumstances and security, does the proposed structure have sufficient flexibility and range to change the countries and sites on short notice so that residents are not compelled to lose opportunities previously scheduled?  ■ Does the resident structure have optimized safety measures (vaccines, insurance, medical liability management) and more effective resident preparation via pretrip training, large multidisciplinary teams, and posttrip reporting for long-term sustainability?  ■ Do the requirements for resident supervision fit within the expertise and time resources among the residency’s faculty members, or is it more expedient to have interinstitutional projects (such as multichapter collaborations via RAD-AID) to leverage wider access to faculty members with extensive global health experience?  ■ Does the educational approach require or encourage long-term capacity building at the in-country hospital site (such as having residents implement new protocols, implement new technologies and equipment, train local personnel, evaluate and improve safety and quality, etc), or does the approach imply a more passive role for residents centered on observer-based clinical case exposure?    Finally, a controversial area for global health radiology education is the expanding use of ultrasound in LMICs by personnel who are not formally trained in radiology and may not be certified in ultrasound or medical disciplines. The decreasing cost of ultrasound and increased portability of the equipment are rapidly proliferating ultrasound access and use in developing countries, while regulations and training guidelines still lag far behind in these nations. An important goal for the coming years in global health radiology is to specify how ultrasound users in LMICs should be trained, certified, and regulated to ensure ethical, safe, and effective use of the modality. To further develop ultrasound training and support, RAD-AID and the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB) announced a partnership in 2016 to link RAD-AID’s in-hospital on-site trainings with WFUMB’s ultrasound workshops to better synthesize demonstrations and didactic learning with on-site health worker assistance. Currently planned project sites for the WFUMB/RAD-AID collaboration include Guatemala and Ethiopia in 2017.  Technology Adoption for Low-Resource Radiology There are four central patterns for the adoption and implementation of technological assets in low-resource health care systems: (1) accelerated acquisition of up-to-date equipment, such as rapid economic growth in China supporting direct the purchase of new and advanced imaging equipment; (2) implementation of older (sometimes obsolete) technologies acquired at a lower cost because of depreciation from their original value, such as donation or resale of used radiologic systems previously operated by US hospitals, which is common throughout Africa and Latin America; (3) acquisition of modified technologies (lower cost substitutes) designed to lower the cost of equipment via reduction of equipment functionality, such as experimental or developmental technology projects managed by new vendor market entrants, nonprofits, or government aid agencies with examples in low-cost or reduced function ultrasound and x-ray radiography; and (4) adoption of technology innovations that are superior to conventional technologies with higher function and lower cost than conventional approaches (or “leapfrog” technologies), such as the proliferation of cellular phone systems superseding landline communications infrastructure as a more cost-efficient health telecommunications strategy. RAD-AID programs have directly interfaced with all of these technology adoption pathways. In China, the first model for accelerated adoption of state-of-the art radiologic equipment via economic growth has advanced the state of radiology but has necessitated greater investment in personnel training for quality and safety. The RAD-AID China program has taken this approach in Yinchuan at Ningxia Medical Center to also advance multidisciplinary cancer care through improved integration of diagnostic imaging, radiation oncology, and clinical oncology and nursing programs. RAD-AID also pursued this accelerated adoption strategy in collaboration with the Philips Foundation to donate and implement four new CT scanners in Haiti and Guyana, advanced ultrasound equipment donations in Guyana and Laos, and implementation of PACS in Ghana, Nicaragua, Laos, and Nepal with support from Merge Healthcare (an IBM company) and IBM Health Corps. All of these efforts to implement advanced technologies emphasize on-site personnel training in parallel with the equipment installations for long-term sustainability. The second model, donating older depreciated equipment at a lower cost after some asset depreciation, is helpful for achieving short-term clinical aims in LMICs, but this model has several drawbacks. First, older used equipment has a shorter lifespan and more maintenance challenges, with limited availability of vendor-supported service contracts after expired warranties. Second, the donation or purchase of reduced-cost depreciated equipment often sustains the gap between high-income country health systems and LMICs because developing countries continue to acquire equipment after they have aged into obsolescence, while advanced health care systems acquire the updated technologies. RAD-AID is attempting to build a better model for the acquisition, deployment, and support of refurbished models so that these secondhand equipment donations from US-based hospitals can better close the gaps in underserved areas of developing countries. The third model, offering lower cost equipment models to low-resource health institutions, is an attractive area of product development. Such efforts have been relatively robust for making radiography and ultrasound more accessible, such as World Health Imaging System for Radiography [14] , MinXray [15] , and Global DiagnostiX [16] . For ultrasound access, new products are bringing down unit costs via tablets and phone-based systems with attachable probes and compact laptop models. The principal challenge with these innovations is ensuring that key functions have not been removed to save costs that may overly limit clinical utility and safety. Moreover, if a product innovation with reduced cost and modified functionality is offered in developing countries, they may be experimental and require institutional review board approvals, appropriate patient consents, and extensive disclosures of possible risks to local in-country institutional partners, especially when FDA approval is not yet available. This challenge raises the important distinction between charitable outreach using conventional technologies conjoined with educational training versus experimental protocols on not-yet-validated technologies. Even though both of these approaches aim in principal to close health care disparities, RAD-AID has consistently cautioned in-country partners on the critical distinction between charitable outreach via educational support of widely used FDA-approved technologies versus technology experimentation in low-resource countries. The fourth model of leapfrog [17] , innovating new technologies that disrupt and replace older, less cost-effective methods, is widely viewed as a technically challenging but promising way to close health care disparities. One potential example with high current visibility is the use of cognitive computing and AI to achieve automated interpretation of medical images in low-resource regions of LMICs to fill the roles of absent or unavailable radiology professionals or increase the efficiency of scarce radiologists. Strong market forces are accelerating the drive to create AI technologies for diagnostic imaging in radiology-shortage areas. One principal consideration for using AI to reduce radiology shortages is that most areas of LMICs lack radiology IT, such as PACS, radiology information systems, and electronic medical records. The jump to AI solutions may warrant that health institutions already have digital imaging on PACS or other advanced workstations, which most facilities do not have in the developing world. This technological limitation raises the question of whether AI can serve as a leapfrog that bypasses PACS implementation in LMICs, or is there a minimum technology base in the developing world that will have to develop first before AI solutions become applicable? RAD-AID will be working on this long-term question in collaboration with IBM Health Corps in 2017 [18] . Another leapfrog example in RAD-AID programs is the recently announced medical airship program in collaboration with Lockheed Martin and Straightline Aviation [19] . According to the World Bank, approximately 900 million to 1 billion people lack transportation infrastructure, such as passable roads, rail, and airports, which is a significant driver of sustained poverty [20] . The new hybrid airship from Lockheed Martin is an aircraft innovation capable of carrying heavy cargo (exceeding 20 tons) with low-vibration flight, no local mooring, and landing on unprepared flat surfaces such as sand, snow, and water. As a unique innovation for possible transportation and operation of delicate heavy radiology equipment, RAD-AID entered into an agreement with Straightline Aviation to collaborate on developing the Lockheed airship as the first ever hybrid medical airship (Fig. 2  ). This is a leapfrog approach for overcoming the inadequate transportation infrastructure in many parts of the world and will be designed and implemented over the next 3 to 5 years. This approach leverages RAD-AID’s prior experience with innovative mobile health in northern India, caring for 16,000 patients to date, so that mobile designs and prior RAD-AID experience for reaching marginalized populations can be leveraged for the new Lockheed aircraft. These examples demonstrate that there is no single technology or clinical model that serves the entire medically underserved population of the LMICs. Instead, a flexible multipronged approach attempts to factor in when economic resources and/or public sector aid may enable accelerated technological asset acquisition, versus systematic short-term support for reusing older technologies, versus innovations to offer lower cost substitutes, or leapfrog innovations to overstep and bypass current technology limitations. Each local circumstance and country or region warrants a specific strategy adopted to the local circumstances and context, for which RAD-AID has used its radiology readiness assessments as a planning tool and starting point.  Conclusions This discussion has covered several important themes from the 2016 RAD-AID Conference, aiming to address health care disparities associated with absent or inadequate radiology resources in LMICs. The UN’s new SDGs offer a unique opportunity for radiology to participate in the next phase of global public health engagement, including economic development, health care capacity building, partnership development, educational support, and infrastructure investment, particularly as the heightened emphasis on noncommunicable diseases necessitates radiology. Educational strategies are continuing to move in a positive direction by offering technologists, medical students, residents, and radiologists structured pathways for global health project execution that reciprocally benefits the training of local radiology personnel in LMICs. Technology adoption presents multiple inroads for advancing radiology in low-resource regions, but technology adoption should accommodate local resource availability and clinical contexts, with strong emphasis on program planning, ethical processes, preproject due diligence, assessments, and long-term training of personnel to sustain the high-impact use of radiologic technologies.  Take-Home Points ■ Newly adopted SDGs from the UN offer potent platforms for radiology to have a significant global public health impact from 2016 to 2030.  ■ Accelerated global activity in the radiology community is transforming medical imaging into an effective spearhead of health care capacity building in poor and developing countries.  ■ Rapidly proliferating use of ultrasound by nonradiology personnel without formal training and certification in LMICs warrants action from the radiology community on how such ultrasound users in the developing world should be trained, certified, and regulated to ensure ethical, safe, and effective use of the modality.  ■ Medical imaging technology adoption in LMICs often involves accelerated acquisition of up-to-date technologies, receipt of donated older or refurbished (sometimes obsolete) technologies, lower cost substitute technologies, and leapfrog innovations.  ■ Education of radiology residents and technologist students should ideally integrate capacity building to prioritize positive impact on LMICs’ radiology institutions.
