                  Growing public interest in environmental, social, and governance issues requires all organizations to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Because the metals industry has been less likely to report engagement with the SDGs than other sectors, exploring its relationship with the SDGs is essential in accelerating its engagement with these goals. This study examines the relationship between the metals industry and the SDGs by analyzing reports of 61 metal companies. The analysis adopts the number of activities associated with SDGs as a proxy indicator in measuring the intensity of association between the company and 17 SDGs. The results show that the metals industry places most focus on SDGs 8, 3, and 12, but its activities are less associated with SDGs 14, 2, and 1 on the whole. Furthermore, this relationship with the SDGs shows different trends among metal producers: the steel industry places great weight on SDG 12 and less on SDGs 1 and 2, whereas the copper industry recognizes the relevance to SDGs 1 and 2. This is attributed to the different positions of the production companies in the supply chain because current SDG reporting seems to be strongly affected by the circumstances and stakeholders they face directly. For further commitment to the SDGs, these findings recommend that metal producers consider the values and benefits that the metals provide throughout the value chain. This study is of value in increasing knowledge about the metal industry's strengths and weaknesses within the SDG framework and suggests future involvement.

Keywords Sustainable development goals  SDG reporting  ESG  Metal company  Value chain    1 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations (UN) as part of its 2030 agenda are acknowledged as the framework for a sustainable future. The SDGs comprise 17 global goals and 169 targets covering economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection, whereas the previous Millennium Development Goals emphasized resolving poverty in developing countries. The agenda states that “all countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, will implement this plan” (United Nations, 2015 , p. 1), and governments in many countries are developing strategies and practices to achieve these goals. In parallel, organizations at various levels such as local governments, industries, and civil societies, which are regarded as stakeholders in the agenda, have been requested to commit to the SDGs. Although the 2030 agenda calls for the participation of every stakeholder, a commitment to SDGs is recognized as particularly urgent for private companies against the background of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment. It has become more necessary for companies to determine and report the social and environmental consequences of their corporate activities following the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) launched by the UN in 2006. The PRI has 3038 signatories, while its total assets under UN management reached 103.4 trillion dollars in 2020; these figures represent 120% and 75% increases from 2015, respectively (PRI Association, 2020 ). Furthermore, because the SDGs covered the major issues in ESG investment, it has been reported that 65% of asset managers and owners align their investment frameworks with them (BNP Paribas, 2019 ). The UN supports companies’ commitment to the SDGs with resources such as the SDG Compass (GRI, 2015 ), SDG Industry Matrix (KPMG International (KPMG), 2015 ), and SDG Indicators (UN, 2020 ). However, it is difficult for companies to identify the goals to which they contribute directly and indirectly. KPMG (2018)  reveals that even among the world's 250 largest companies, fewer than half (43%) linked their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities to the SDGs in 2017. The percentages are particularly low for sectors dealing with business-to-business commerce such as industry, manufacturing and metals (30%) and oil and gas (27%), compared with consumer-facing sectors like utilities (58%), automotive (58%), and retail (57%). Notably, the metals industry has often been concerned about its negative social and environmental effects through the supply chains. For example, CO2  emission reduction in the steel industry has often been discussed owing to its energy-intensive production process (Kim and Worrell, 2002 ; Pauliuk and Heeren, 2021 ). As represented by conflict minerals, there have been many cases where a negative social and environmental effect caused by mining activities has threatened local sustainability and disrupted supply (Hatayama and Tahara, 2018 ; Lèbre et al., 2019 ). In case that a negative social and environmental effect is concerned by the local community, the resource development companies require their approval to avoid costly conflict and business risks (Prno and Slocombe, 2014 ). These situations encourage resource development companies to acquire a “sustainable development license to operate” that falls within the ambit of the SDGs (UNEP, 2019 ). Furthermore, the achievement of the SDGs will be supported by the circular economy where the manufacturing and metals industry contribute to improving resource efficiency and creating new business opportunities (Rodriguez-Anton et al., 2019 ; Schroeder et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). Therefore, sustainability reporting addressing responsible management of ESG issues would reduce the friction between metal producers and society. The previous literature discusses the role of sustainability reporting in facing up to society and stakeholders. As a flip side of CSR's positive effect on stakeholder relations, financial risk becomes created by negative information on corporate social irresponsibility (Kölbel et al., 2017 ). Such a situation provokes companies to adopt the SDG Compass in their reporting, especially when confronted with a pessimistic appraisal by investors (García-Sánchez et al., 2020a ). Meanwhile, it is indicated in Scheyvens et al. (2016)  that companies think most SDG issues are “add-on” in their business case, and there exist barriers to the companies being a sustainable development actor. As a result, sustainability reporting shows a different trend of commitment to SDGs depending on the company's stakeholders and business opportunities. In the research to explore those trends, content analysis is often employed to elucidate the relationship with respective SDGs. Content analysis of documents published by companies and institutions clarified the different emphasis on 17 SDGs among sectors (García-Sánchez et al., 2020b ; van der Waal et al., 2021 ). Bali Swain and Yang-Wallentin (2020)  and van Zanten and van Tulder (2021)  point out the strong interest in social and environmental factors by companies in developed countries, whereas developing countries tend to focus on the economic benefits. Besides a standpoint of business actor, Körfgen et al. (2018)  shows the relationship between the academic institute and each SDG by reviewing their publications and research projects. Holistic investigation on sustainability reporting is thus effective in exploring the SDGs focused by a particular organization or sector. As we look to the metal and mining sector, the content analysis is employed by Mancini and Sala (2018)  that assess the social impact of the mining sector through a review of 50 publications and compare it with indicators proposed in sustainable development frameworks. However, few studies provide a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the metal industry's commitment to the SDGs. This study aims to clarify the relationship between the metal industry and 17 SDGs by analyzing SDG reporting of metal producers. The content analysis of SDG reporting provides the answer to the following research questions:RQ1: How does the metal industry recognize its commitment to 17 SDGs?  RQ2: Do the relevant SDGs differ depending on the metal produced? If yes, what is the reason for the difference?    There is a diversity in the production process, supply chain structure and end-use products by metal. Therefore, metal industry would comprise companies having different advantages and limitations in the commitment to SDGs. This study contributes to increasing knowledge about the metal industry's strengths and weaknesses within the SDG framework and suggests future involvement. The following section explains the methodology to evaluate the intensity of the associations between the goals and the industry using SDG reporting. The result shows the strengths and weaknesses against the 17 goals for both the overall and specific metal industry. Finally, the diversity of relationships and recommendations for further pursuit of the SDGs are discussed.  2 Materials and methods This study evaluates the relationship between the metals industry and SDGs with a focus on corporate activities highlighted in their SDG reporting. As stated in the previous section, the focus of analysis lies in SDGs’ relationship with the overall metal industry (to answer RQ1) and with specific metal producers (to answer RQ2). Therefore, preliminary investigation on SDG reporting was directed to major producers of each different metal. The contents of reporting were then analyzed to measure the intensity of association between companies and 17 SDGs. However, there has been a lack of appropriate methodologies and indicators to measure the impact on SDGs (Mansell et al., 2020 ), which hampers accurate evaluation of the achievement of the SDGs (Diaz-Sarachaga et al., 2018 ). Therefore, previous research addresses the organization's relevance to different goals through a questionnaire to persons who belong there (Mansell et al., 2020 ; van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018 ). In this sense, organization's relevance to SDGs has been evaluated based on their recognition instead of their impact. This study develops a methodology to measure the intensity of association based on the number of activities referenced in the SDG reporting. 2.1 Preliminary investigation Firstly, a preliminary investigation was conducted to identify the companies addressing SDGs in their reporting. The investigation focuses on major companies producing 10 metals (or metal groups): steel, copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc, gold, silver, platinum group metals (PGMs), silicon, and rare-earth elements (REEs). A cumulative total of 152 companies selected for our preliminary investigation includes 50 steel companies and nearly 10 companies for each of the other metals (details on the investigation target can be found in the Supplementary material). Each company's website and reports (e.g., its CSR report, sustainability report, and integrated report) were investigated to identify any association between its actions, initiatives, or principles (referred to as “activities” hereafter) and specific goals. Although these reports are updated approximately every year, the assessment was based on the latest information available in September 2019. The preliminary investigation revealed that 76 of the 152 companies describe the association between their activities and the specific goals (Table 1  ). Among the nonferrous metals companies, 62% (63 of 102) associate their activities with the SDGs, whereas only 26% (13 of 50) of steel companies do so. The reason for this lower reported rate is that half of the 50 steel companies are based in China and they tend not to report on activities related to SDGs (Ma et al., 2020 ). The analysis in the next section was conducted for the companies that related their activities to SDGs. It should be noted that the net number of the company is 61 because several companies were counted as a major producer of multiple metals.  2.2 Measuring the intensity of association between companies and the SDGs The methodology to measure the intensity of association between companies and the SDGs was developed based on a simple but reasonable assumption that more frequent references to a goal in its reports correspond to a greater acknowledgement of commitment to that goal. By using the number of activities associated with SDGs as a proxy indicator, it is possible to conduct a quantitative evaluation of the intensity of association with each goal. However, the style of reporting on the associations between activities and goals varies between companies. Because of the interdependencies and inseparability of the goals (McGowan et al., 2019 ), the associations between activities and goals in SDG reporting are not expressed on a one-to-one basis in most cases. Therefore, this study breaks down the SDG reporting into a suitable data set for quantitative analysis. Fig. 1   shows how the various styles of SDG reporting were converted to a consistent data set. Style (a) lists the activities related to each goal where a one-to-one correspondence is clear. Style (b) lists the activities and assigns the relevant goals to each. In this style, more than one goal is associated with a single activity. Style (c) is complex because it is difficult to judge whether all the activities listed are associated with all goals or (partly) a combination of one-to-one correspondence. With the utmost consideration of the interdependencies and inseparability of the goals, this study presumes that an association can be found between each goal and activity. Through this conversion procedure, data sets of SDG reporting containing goals paired with activities were obtained for 61 companies in 10 metals industries. These data sets were used to evaluate the intensity of each company's association with 17 goals. These data can simply be used to identify the goals prioritized by every company. Furthermore, industry-wide trends were analyzed by integrating the data sets of multiple companies. This study expresses the industry-wide trend as Eq. (1) :(1) R ( m , g  )  =  1 N m   ∑ i  N i , g   ∑ g  N i , g     × 17     where R(m, g)  denotes the relative intensity of association with SDG #g  for the metal m  industry. Nm   is the number of companies producing metal m  that report on SDGs (Table 1 ), and Ni,g   is the number of activities that company i  (producing metal m ) associates with SDG #g . It should be noted that the integration needs to consider differences in company attitudes to SDG reporting. Some companies list dozens of activities that address almost all SDGs, whereas other companies prioritize specific goals and list a few activities with high materiality. Hence, the number of activities is normalized in Eq. (1)  so that each company is given the same weight. R(m,g)  satisfies Eq. (2)  for any m: (2) ∑ g = 1  17  R ( m , g  )  = 17     When the number of activities associated with a certain goal is at the average level for the 17 goals, the value of R(m, g)  for that goal is evaluated to be 1. Therefore, one can readily find which goals are recognized to a greater (or lesser) extent by the respective industries.   3 Results 3.1 Associations between activities and the SDGs: Case of steel and copper industry Table 2   indicates the number of activities associated with each of 17 SDGs by 13 steel companies. Company S2 refers to all 17 goals reasonably equally, while companies S1, S7, S8, and S13 narrow down the associated goals to fewer than 10. Company S12 seems to have set a strong priority on SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), where activities related to financial and material support for an educational institution (e.g., financial support for university research projects and workshops, contributing to stationery and lunch expenses) are associated with SDG 4, and the introduction of new plant facilities is associated with SDG 9. The analysis of company SDG reporting found that most commitments to SDGs are addressed by the development of production processes, improvement of the working environment, and community services for charitable purposes. However, company S2 also focuses on SDGs 9, 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action) in the production of a wide variety of steel-containing products such as buildings, vehicles, and home electrical appliances, which enrich people's lives. Although those products are not a direct output of the steel producer, this is typical of the practice of “mapping the SDGs against the value chain” indicated in the SDG Compass. Table 3   represents the SDG reporting from the copper industry. Companies C2 and C7 report on their adherence to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards framework. For example, in the case of company C2, SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) is related mainly to the Economic and Social topics, while SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) is related to General Disclosure. The SDG reporting from companies C4 and C6 lists the relevant SDGs along with their sustainability or social investment framework descriptions. The results for the other metal industries can be found in the Supplementary material.  3.2 Diversity of SDG associations in the metal industry The relative intensity of association with each SDG is shown in Fig. 2  . Fig. 2 (a) represents the overall intensity of association for the metals industry. The values in Fig. 2 (a) are an average of R(m, g)  for each of 10 metals based on Eq. (1)  (Fig. 2 (b)). Fig. 2 (a) indicates that the companies most clearly recognize SDGs 8, 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Decent work and economic growth obviously have a direct link with business activities, so it should be easy to associate a company's activities with SDG 8. Activities related to SDG 3 aim to improve the well-being not only of product users and employees but also of the local community in mining areas. The main contribution to SDG 12 is reductions in primary resource consumption and waste generation using improvements in material efficiency in production processes and recycling. In addition, companies believe that SDG 12 can be achieved by building good relationships with suppliers and encouraging them to fulfill their CSR goals. The least relevance is indicated for SDG 14 (Life below Water) followed by SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 1 (No Poverty), which is consistent with the report by KPMG (2018) . However, compared with other industry sectors, the metals industry focuses more on SDG 15 (Life on Land) by working to protect the environment in mining areas. Fig. 2 (b) shows differences in recognition of commitment to the SDGs revealed by the emphases placed on them by producers of 10 metals. Steel companies recognize the importance of SDGs 8, 12, and 9, whereas they struggle to relate their activities to SDGs 1 and 2. Meanwhile, copper and PGM companies show a more substantial commitment to SDG 1 by citing economic development, job creation, and various investments in local communities. Aluminum companies present stronger relation to SDG 2, where most activities mention local community development as with other companies. Still, a notable case refers to reducing food loss as a manufacturer of truck bodies, refrigerators, and other facilities in cold chains. Silicon is used in semiconductors and solar modules, so it is indispensable for advanced energy technologies. This value is reflected in commitments to SDGs 7, 9, and 13. The strong relationship between REE companies and SDG 12 is partly formed by a care for environment. A certain company claims that they do not cause severe pollution around plants, which looks like an excuse for the local community's protest against their operation. In this sense, SDG 12 is rather cited to represent a sustainable production within their business. During the interpretation of Fig. 2 (b), it needs to be kept in mind that several large companies are counted as a major producer of multiple metals. Reporting from these companies reflects the value chains of different metals, and the reporting content is shared among metals in evaluating the intensity. In this study, the interpretation was confirmed by the review of activities noted above.  3.3 Linkages and trade-offs between SDGs in the reporting Table 4   shows the bivariate correlations between 17 SDGs calculated from the normalized number of activities reported by 61 companies. It is reasonable to find the most positive correlation between SDGs 3 and 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Another positive correlation exists between SDGs 1 and 2 because they are often associated together with activities for the local community. In addition, energy-efficient process development and installation of renewable energies are typical activities relate to SDGs 7 and 9. On the other hand, there can be found several negative correlations that reflect the company's SDG prioritization or narrow view. SDG 9 shows negative correlations with SDGs 14 and 15, indicating that the reporting emphasizing technology and innovation is likely to be modest for an ecosystem. Furthermore, SDGs 1 and 2 are not compatible with SDG 12 because of the difference in the scope of the metal producer's direct responsibility (see the discussion in Section 4.1 ).   4 Discussion 4.1 SDGs highlighted in the supply chain structure A previous survey by KPMG (2018)  indicates that the world's largest companies (across all industry sectors) pay the most attention to SDGs 13, 8, and 3, and they pay the least attention to SDGs 14, 2, and 15. Fig. 2 (a) shows that the SDGs with strong/weak associations with the metals industry show similar tendencies. Nonetheless, the analysis revealed some unique characteristics of the metals industry's contributions to achieving SDGs. The most distinctive feature is a relatively strong interest in SDG 15, reflecting the need for mining and smelting operations to avoid the destruction of the natural environment. Because many mining areas are located in developing countries, various forms of investment, support, and communication concerning local people are listed as contributing to SDGs 1–5. The analysis also revealed variations in the focus of metals industry SDG reporting. Contrasting results were obtained for the steel and copper industries: steel producers focused heavily on SDG 12, but less on SDGs 1 and 2, whereas copper producers focused on SDGs 1 and 2 but placed modest weight on SDG 12. The difference can be explained by the position of producers in supply chains. Most steel producers purchase iron ore from a resource development company. They do not produce iron ore by themselves, even though they invest in resource development companies for stable procurement. This means that steel producers do not have a direct responsibility to local communities in mining areas for their activities. Conversely, the large copper producers in Table 3  also have the characteristics of a resource development company; therefore, they can procure their own copper ore. For these copper producers, the local community is recognized as the closest stakeholder. The proximity of local communities in developing countries to mining activities is thus considered to affect commitment to SDGs 1 and 2. Meanwhile, the purchase of raw materials from outside has raised steel producer's awareness of relationships with suppliers. Actually, “supplier” and “supply chain” are common keywords in descriptions of steel company activities in relation to SDG 12; steel companies attend to the social and environmental risks of the raw materials supply chain: stable product supply, supply chain due diligence, punctual payment to suppliers, etc. The position of producers in the supply chain is also a reason for the high emphasis on SDG 1 by the PGM industry and low emphasis by the silicon industry. In current SDG reporting, metal companies are strongly affected by their immediate circumstances and stakeholders. Fig. 2 (b) clarifies the strong relationship between every metal industry and SDGs 8, 3 and 12, whereas Table 4  implies the different prioritization by companies. Although supply chain structure is considered as an influential factor in prioritization, there would be other factors that affect SDG reporting of all or particular metal producers. Sustainable development issues prioritized by different metal industries can be revealed by further analysis of reporting, such as a textual analysis in García-Sánchez et al. (2020b) .  4.2 Recommendation to metal producers on SDG reporting Our comprehensive analysis of SDG reporting revealed the contributions that metal producers emphasize. As mentioned in the previous section, SDG reporting to date seem to reflect concern for stakeholders in the supply chain. Do they fully reflect the value of metals and metal companies in the context of SDGs? In addition to the individual company, metal industry associations such as the World Steel Association (worldsteel)  and the International Copper Association (ICA)  indicate their commitment to SDGs (ICA, 2016 ; worldsteel, 2016 ). The commitment of worldsteel and ICA is summarized in the Supplementary material. The topics they mention are often incorporated into the reports by the member companies surveyed in this study. However, the two associations take different approaches to emphasizing their involvement in the SDGs. The highlighted principles of worldsteel are “Disclosure and Transparency,” “Ethical Standards,” and “Stakeholder Management”; therefore, the report develops a normative constitution of the organization rather than providing examples of action. The organization's normative constitution is as a piece of a sustainable world beyond the SDGs and at the same time as an indispensable pillar of sustainable business. Meanwhile, ICA shows the contribution of copper to SDGs by explaining how it is used in practical ways. The contributions are confirmed by the notable material properties of copper such as high electrical conductivity, harmlessness, antimicrobial properties, and durability. Owing to these properties, ICA asserts that “No other metal or material connects so broadly and critically with the global sustainable-development agenda” (ICA, 2016 , p. 3). Furthermore, ICA launched an assurance system for responsible copper production, the Copper Mark, in 2019. The Copper Mark sets SDG 12 as its main focus and assesses copper producers with criteria covering a wide variety of ESG issue areas (ICA, n.d.). Both approaches taken by worldsteel and ICA encourage companies to develop their SDG reporting. It is stated by the SDG Compass that “integrating sustainability into the core business and governance, and embedding sustainable development targets across all functions within the company is key to achieving set goals” (GRI, 2015 , p. 5). To incorporate the SDGs into a business strategy, normative constitutions like worldsteel show this to be a favorable form of goal setting. Many companies struggle to identify what they do to pursue SDGs, but it is important for them first to clarify what sort of organization they want to be. Otherwise, the SDG reporting may be considered a token effort simply to avoid social disapproval. Another important implication of ICA reporting is the influence of materials throughout the value chain. This study found that metal producers are aware of upstream SDG issues in their value chain, which results in a strong association with SDGs 12 and 3. On the other hand, the companies are less likely to consider a contribution downstream. As implied by KPMG's report, they, as well as other sectors dealing with business-to-business commerce, would hesitate to claim a contribution in a consumer society. For example, there is no doubt that steel is an indispensable material for buildings and infrastructures. Therefore, a significant contribution by steel would be necessary to achieve SDG 11 and associated targets, especially 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, and 11.5. However, Fig. 2 (b) implies that the steel industry is not strongly aware of SDG 11. To achieve substantial SDG reporting, a company needs to define high-priority goals and set key performance indicators to be monitored. These cannot be appropriately implemented without a full understanding of the impact on SDG issues throughout the company's value chain. For metal producers, it would be sensible to consider the social values and benefits provided by their outputs.  4.3 Future support for SDG reporting from an academic perspective This study suggests that current SDG reporting by the metals industry can be developed by considering the whole value chain. The approach precisely reflects life cycle thinking, so a life cycle assessment (LCA) framework is helpful in discussing commitment to the SDGs. The social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) and the life-cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) have been developed to incorporate social and economic aspects in the traditional (i.e., environmental) LCA (Dreyer et al., 2006 ; Guinée et al., 2011 ; Valdivia et al., 2013 ; Weidema, 2006 ). The framework of S-LCA and LCSA suits the concept of SDGs; therefore, they can be used to measure SDG indicators (Herrera Almanza and Corona, 2020 ; Wulf et al., 2018 ). Clarifying the major impacts throughout the value chain will provide insights for company SDG reporting and for LCA research in discussing the impact category. Despite the compatibility between SDGs and the LCA, quantification of the impact remains a challenging problem. Environmental LCA presents the inside-out impacts, where the impact induced by the process is calculated. On the other hand, the S-LCA databases like the Social Hotspots Database and Product Social Impact LCA Database employ social risk indicators represented in terms of risk level, which can be regarded as outside-in impacts. Characterization as outside-in impact categories and their effectiveness in achieving sustainable development needs further discussion before they are utilized as SDG indicators. Although this study suggests considering social values and benefits in SDG reporting, it may raise an allocation problem. Given that the contribution of buildings to SDG 11 is quantified, how much of that contribution can steel claim as a fair share? At present, ESG rating and investing do not seem to reflect the degree of contribution to the SDGs. If it affects ESG investment in the future, consensus-building among investors and various industries needs to be pursued. Thus, assessing contribution to the SDGs is challenging, but it would allow us to construct a consolidated sustainable development framework in which the SDGs become the common language and the shared purpose in the fullest sense.   5 Conclusions This study clarifies the metals industry's commitment to the SDGs through a holistic investigation of SDG reporting by producers. Overall, the report focuses on SDG 8, 3, and 12, which are also prioritized in the other industry sectors. The SDGs less favored by the metals industry are SDGs 14, 2, and 1; these are the least prioritized goals in the other industry sectors as well. Unlike the other industry sectors, however, the metals industry recognizes SDG 15 as relevant to its activities because it relates to mining. The results for metal producers show different trends in the association between activities and 17 SDGs. The steel industry places much weight on SDG 12 but less on SDGs 1 and 2, whereas the copper industry recognizes involvement in SDGs 1 and 2. The reason for the difference seems to be the position of companies in supply chains: steel companies purchase iron ore from outside while it is often a resource development company that produces copper as part of its business. Therefore, the supply problems faced by the companies differ. This implies that metal producers are strongly affected by the circumstances and stakeholders they face directly, and they fail to incorporate the entire value chain into SDG reporting. The metals industry and other business-to-business sectors may find an abundance of opportunities for further commitment to the SDGs by considering the values and benefits that their outputs create throughout the value chain. However, it will be a challenge in the future to determine the extent to which the social values and benefits provided by a product or service are derived from a single component material. Knowledge and experience of the LCA would assist in the creation of an assessment framework.  Supplementary material Supplementary materials for this article can be found online.
