                  The literature treats the approach to corporate engagement with sustainable development goals as a growing field that requires new discussions. Seeking to contribute to this theme, this study aimed to identify the driving factors for the involvement of agroindustries in sustainable development goals by measuring indicators identified as possible determinants of this engagement. This is a descriptive and quantitative study through survey research with a sample of food agroindustries, conducted in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), using the Structural Equation Modeling technique to analyze the equation and structural models. The initial hypothesis confirmed in the study is that engagement with sustainable development goals can occur from two perspectives: organizational attributes and institutional attributes. Ten organizational attributes that determine involvement are listed: sustainability initiatives, governance structure, relationship with stakeholders, inter-organizational collaboration, innovation, moral behavior, ethical motivation, values, competitiveness, and business model. Regarding institutional attributes, three driving factors for involvement in sustainable development goals were identified: tolerant, institutional influencer, and institutionalization.

Handling Editor: Dr. Govindan Kannan The literature treats the approach to corporate engagement with sustainable development goals as a growing field that requires new discussions. Seeking to contribute to this theme, this study aimed to identify the driving factors for the involvement of agroindustries in sustainable development goals by measuring indicators identified as possible determinants of this engagement. This is a descriptive and quantitative study through survey research with a sample of food agroindustries, conducted in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), using the Structural Equation Modeling technique to analyze the equation and structural models. The initial hypothesis confirmed in the study is that engagement with sustainable development goals can occur from two perspectives: organizational attributes and institutional attributes. Ten organizational attributes that determine involvement are listed: sustainability initiatives, governance structure, relationship with stakeholders, inter-organizational collaboration, innovation, moral behavior, ethical motivation, values, competitiveness, and business model. Regarding institutional attributes, three driving factors for involvement in sustainable development goals were identified: tolerant, institutional influencer, and institutionalization.

This plan translates into a global mechanism for the search for sustainable development, comprising seventeen integrated and indivisible goals balancing the economic, social, and environmental dimensions (Fleming et al., 2017 ). In practical terms, the set of 17 SDGs and their corresponding targets foster actions in areas relevant to humanity and the planet, representing the engagement of various interested parties seeking comprehensive sustainable development (Maher and Buhmann, 2019 ). Among these areas are “people” and the determination to end poverty and hunger, “planet” and its protection from degradation, “prosperity” and the understanding that every human being can enjoy a prosperous and fulfilling life, “peace” and the promotion of peaceful, just, and inclusive societies, and “partnerships” for the implementation of this agenda in global solidarity (UN, 2015 ). According to Eweje et al. (2020) , the SDGs are global in scope and interconnected in nature, with the multi-party partnership being the catalyst for achieving them. Partnerships between governments, companies, civil society, financial institutions, donors, and academia are suggested as key to achieving the SDGs. Despite the relevance and benefits attributed to this agenda, the motivation for involvement in the SDGs is voluntary and specific to each actor (Jasmine, 2017 ). Companies’ involvement in the SDGs is treated from different perspectives due to their characteristic of voluntariness and the necessary capacity for effective participation in this agenda (Persaud and Dagher, 2021 ). However, it is reasonable to understand that adherence to the 2030 Agenda suggests a commitment by corporations around common benefits to the whole society (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). The literature has presented indicators that can help identify factors that would lead companies to engage with the SDGs, although scattered approaches exist. However, the engagement of companies to the SDGs is still considered uncertain and globally limited since this discussion is linked to the reasons why companies should engage with common-good objectives (van der Waal and Thisjssen, 2020 ) and because this engagement could be related to the purposes of greenwashing, that is, when companies selectively adopt and/or disclose actions associated with this situation (Heras-Saizarbitoria et al., 2022 ; Johnsson et al., 2020 ), committing themselves solely to their own benefits. Given the above, the general objective of this study is to identify the driving factors of the involvement of agroindustries with Sustainable Development Goals. This analysis is based on measuring indicators identified in the literature as possible determinants of companies' engagement with the SDGs. The SDGs, in this case, will be studied based on their correspondence with the Princípios Empresariais para Alimentos e Agricultura (PEAA, Business Principles for Food and Agriculture), a structure created by Rede Brasil (2016)  to guide private companies in the food and agriculture production sector to adopt solid management strategies that make sense in their daily activities and demonstrate their connection to the global SDG process. The relevance of agroindustries justifies the unit of analysis adopted at the local and regional, national, or international levels, considering their economic, social, or environmental impacts on society (FEIX et al., 2021 ; Maher and Buhmann, 2019 ). In addition, the agri-food industrial sector is a determinant for achieving the SDGs due to its direct association with various themes sensitive to this agenda, such as food security, the eradication of hunger, diversity in food production, and the influence on agriculture and manufacturing (Liu, 2021 ). This study contributes to understanding business engagement with the SDGs, considering that the topic was approached as new and a research gap by Heras-Saizarbitoria et al. (2022)  and van der Waal and Thisjssen (2020)  when analyzing groups of international companies from different sectors regarding this phenomenon. Authors such as Fleming et al. (2017) , Pedersen (2018) , Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018) , and Mombeuil (2020)  discussed the engagement of companies with the SDGs in the form of a case study, analyzing isolated variables as influencing the participation with the SDGs, or even discussing this phenomenon for a single SDG. In a recent study, Leal Filho et al. (2023)  advanced the discussion on engagement with the SDGs by analyzing the panorama of this phenomenon in the context of higher education institutions, showing the possibilities of clarifying the forms of participation. By taking food agroindustrial organizations as the object of this study, the role of these companies in achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda is also brought to the forefront of the discussion. Among other factors, it is assumed that companies in the food sector are protagonists in developing more efficient and scalable production systems to guarantee food security and preserve natural resources. Additionally, even though it is not the central object of this study, it is necessary to mention the involvement of the entire supply chain from agroindustrialization to the SDGs. As Jouzdani and Govindan (2021)  already exposed, the production chains of perishable foods impact the environment and society from many aspects. Therefore, an alignment in their structural actions can contribute to achieving several SDGs. Additionally, the proposed contribution of this study and its differentiation from others already developed is characterized by the analysis of engagement with the SDGs in a group of private companies in a specific sector, that is, agrifood industries. Also, engagement is analyzed for all 17 SDGs, while relating them to the structure of the PEAA (REDE BRASIL, 2016 ), and confronting them with factors identified in the literature as possible determinants for this engagement. Seeking to bring greater solidity and new methodological possibilities within this theme, multivariate statistics was adopted to examine the data, through the structural equation modeling technique, a technique that has yet to be identified in previous studies on engagement with the SDGs. Finally, it is essential to identify within the study sample which current efforts are being implemented to cooperate with the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, a subject addressed in the following sections of this article.  2 Engagement with the sustainable development goals Considering the essence of the meaning of engagement, why would companies engage with the SDGs? The literature has presented indications that can help answer this question, although scattered approaches on the subject are observed. Also, there are few papers since this field of knowledge was developed after the publication of the 2030 Agenda (UN, 2015 ). Thus, the following seeks to consolidate the main ideas about this phenomenon, facilitating its understanding and instrumentalizing the construction of elements for empirical application. At first, it is important to remember that the set of SDGs, visualized in Fig. 1  , results from a collective construction of various interested parties, such as governments, policymakers, educational institutions, and the corporate sector (Jasmine, 2017 ). Just as there was a partnership in its creation, it is important for these actors to be robustly engaged in their implementation, monitoring, and evaluation (Biermann et al., 2017 ). Significantly, under this new agenda, there are expectations of actions for which companies, government, and civil society actors are equally responsible in progressing to a more sustainable path (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). The authors of recent research that analyzes organizational engagement with the SDGs emphasize the research gap on this subject and highlight the lack of empirical work examining this initiative at the corporate level. Based on sustainability reports from organizations from different countries, it was qualitatively analyzed how and why there is involvement with the SDGs and the priority assigned to them. Their findings indicate a superficial engagement with the SDGs for most organizations, which suggests a process of greenwashing, i.e., information management and SDG washing. They also identified that adherence to the SDGs is directly related to the perspective of corporate social responsibility, to the opportunities generated by the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and to the regulation imposed by the activity developed (Heras-Saizarbitoria et al., 2022 ). In any case, an attentive look at greenwashing becomes relevant as adopting corporate responsibility practices forms a response to the call for sustainable development. However, companies choose to selectively disclose to their stakeholders only information that facilitates their increase in value, leaving aside those that could negatively affect their sustainable performance. The study conducted by van der Waal and Thisjssen (2020)  also sought to analyze the factors determining the engagement of two thousand large companies worldwide listed on stock exchanges with the SDGs through information published in sustainability reports. The results showed that corporate involvement in the SDGs is still limited and mainly associated with commitment to other sustainability-related issues and with the configuration of countries and the company's size and level of corporate sustainability. According to the authors, this indicates that engagement with the SDGs is inspired by a mixture of legitimacy and institutional motives (attributes of the companies themselves), suggesting an involvement that is symbolic, intentional, and substantive at the same time. In turn, the study by Martínez-Ferrero and García-Meca (2020)  analyzes the strength of internal corporate governance as a mechanism for engaging with Sustainable Development Goals. The paper examines CEO independence, board composition, and board presence as internal corporate governance factors that affect a company's commitment to sustainable development, arriving at the assertion that greater corporate governance strength, from an internal perspective, increases the propensity to engage and report on SDGs in corporate sustainability reporting. In search of complementation to the foundations and motivations that lead companies to engage in the SDGs, Santos and Bastos (2020)  expose three justifications for this phenomenon in a multi-case analysis in Portuguese companies: a) ethical justification: integration into the SDGs reflects a normative dimension resulting from considerations based on values and ethical motivations that are implicit in their corporate culture and leadership; b) contextual justification: integration into the SDGs represents a fundamental step based on the need to establish and manage social relations and generate legitimacy by interested parties; c) economic justification: integration into the SDGs occurs based on their usefulness to obtain economic gains, higher levels of competitiveness, and seek sectoral leadership. According to Escher and Brzustewicz (2020) , inter-organizational collaboration also supports companies' engagement with the SDGs, and the relationship between companies and other organizations, especially non-governmental organizations, reveals cooperation and positive results in supporting the SDGs through projects to solve specific social or environmental problems. From a differentiated perspective, the institutional conditions of a country also determine companies’ engagement with the SDGs. Factors such as effective government, political will, regulatory quality, Rule of Law, control of corruption, and reduction of inequalities are substantial evidence that can support and foster the realization of the SDGs by companies. Also, the quality of institutional conditions for completing the SDGs would be linked to four institutional motivations conducive to the adoption of sustainable business practices (Aljerf and Choukaife, 2016 ): a) there should be a functioning market in which companies have discretion over their responses to the market, both socially and politically; b) government and legal institutions should be efficient enough to guarantee, define, and manage the local market and act on behalf of society to address issues related to market flaws; c) government and legal institutions should not be subverted to any actors operating in the market; d) there should be a civil society capable of institutionalizing and articulating standards and values (Mombeuil, 2020 ). In the same institutional perspective, Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018)  began from the assumption that the SDGs are an institution and analyzed how this affected the engagement of 81 multinational companies with the SDGs, i.e., companies that have their activities internationalized. According to these authors, institutional factors, such as the search for legitimacy, are important but not the only motivators for engaging in specific SDGs. Companies engage more with SDG targets that are actionable within their operations than those outside of them and more with SDG targets that “prevent harm” than those that “do good”. From another perspective, the SDGs offer an opportunity for the company to look to the future and seek guidance for investments and new business opportunities, thus representing a new tool for innovation and market development. For companies in business unsuitable to this proposal, the SDGs also provide guidance for reducing risks and costs and, in some cases, propel the company to adopt a more sustainable business model. Furthermore, a full commitment to the SDGs by companies is characterized by other factors or practices, among which are internal leadership capacity, involvement with parties interested in the business, collaboration with the public entity, being a responsible company – respecting the environment, people, and society – attraction, motivation, and retention of employees, recognition of the role of the customer and investors, and, finally, innovation portfolio (Pedersen, 2018 ). In a case study, Fleming et al. (2017)  suggest that companies can productively engage with the SDGs, even without government requirements or social expectations, if they are prepared to broaden their interpretation of sustainability and reflect on its values. According to them, the organization's values were the main determinants of positive perceptions and willingness to adopt the SDGs. It is important to emphasize that there is no consensus in the literature on how corporate involvement and progress in the SDGs can be analyzed by specific indicators due to the breadth of issues that involve this agenda, the diversity of instruments created for this purpose, and the specific needs of each research (Bidarbakhtnia, 2020 ). However, at the international level, the structure proposed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a solid mechanism that can facilitate analyzing the performance of organizations concerning their engagement with the SDGs (Heras-Saizarbitoria et al., 2022 ). Considering the studies received and the field of study under construction, it is assumed that company engagement with the implementation of the SDGs can be analyzed from two large dimensions: organizational attributes and institutional attributes. Table 1   shows the consolidation of organizational attributes and their respective authorial basis. In addition to the organizational attributes mentioned, companies’ engagement in implementing the SDGs from institutional attributes is also possible. Table 2   shows these attributes, which are theoretically based on studies already mentioned. The analysis of the relationship of institutional attributes with the implementation of the SDGs is aligned with the assumptions of institutional theory. Assuming the institutional perspective, in this case, is to emphasize the elements of the environment in which the company is inserted, which can influence the formation of organizational practices (Carvalho and Vieira, 2003 ). As institutional theory assumes, the actions of organizations are conditioned by their institutional environment (Peci, 2006 ). These conditions are represented by informal rules (beliefs, culture, and values of individuals and society) and formal rules (legal regulation of society), which will influence its functioning (Scott, 1987 ). Aligning with an institution can generate organizational legitimacy, achieved through institutionalization, according to different isomorphic processes (Dimaggio and Powell, 1983 ). Thus, companies that work towards the SDGs would generate benefits, including legitimization and recognition before society (Donoher, 2017 ). In this context, two hypotheses were elaborated that guide the empirical execution of the study. Table 3   presents these hypotheses and with their expected effects. Concerning the measurement of implementing the SDGs (UN, 2015 ) proposed in this research, the adopted construct considers the PEAA (Rede Brasil, 2016 ), a document published by a national organization linked to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the UN. In addition to correlating each business principle for food production with the SDGs, themes, and fronts of action are available for each principle, as specified in the following methodological section, facilitating the operationalization of measurement indicators. Therefore, by examining different dimensions – organizational and institutional - of companies' engagement with the SDGs, it will be possible to expand the knowledge of the factors that influence the implementation of this sustainable development agenda in the business sphere. The next chapter describes the procedures and methods adopted to develop this analysis.  3 Methodological procedures A descriptive and quantitative study was developed through the survey research strategy considering that the objective of this article is to identify the driving factors of the involvement of agroindustries with Sustainable Development Goals. The descriptive plans aim to detail the characteristics of a certain population or phenomenon, or to establish relationships between variables. Quantitative research tests objective hypotheses and strategies that provide a quantitative or numerical description of a population's tendencies, attitudes, or opinions based on the study of a population sample. A questionnaire containing 72 questions on an ordinal scale assumed as an interval of the five-point Likert type to subsidize the survey research (Hair et al., 2014 ) to evaluate the investigated constructs: engagement attributes and sustainable development goals. It should be noted that this first block is composed of 32 questions, and business engagement is measured through two constructs: organizational attributes of engagement and institutional attributes of engagement, as theoretically based on Tables 2 and 3  of the literature review section on this topic. The second block, consisting of 40 questions, comprises the research inherent to the SDGs. The measurement of this construct was based on the Business Principles for Food and Agriculture (PEAA), developed by Rede Brasil (2016) , which aim to facilitate the adoption of solid management strategies by private companies in the food sector, especially small and medium, in addition to directing them to contribute to the advancement of the 2030 Agenda (Un, 2015 ) for sustainable development in the Brazilian context. It is also emphasized that, in addition to the principles associated with certain SDGs, as highlighted in Table 4  , this framework explains its activity area and presents indicators that companies can assume, facilitating subsequent measurements. The study target population comprised 3611 food agribusinesses in Rio Grande do Sul, officially legalized before the State Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock and Rural Development (Division of Family Farming and Agroindustry and division of Inspection of Animal Products), its regulatory body. The statistical power of the sample size was determined using the software G*Power to calculate the minimum sample size considered acceptable for structural equation modeling analyses (Faul et al., 2007 ). The calculation criterion was adopted a priori , observing the test power parameters (Power = 1 - βerror prob. II ) with a value of 0.80, effect size (f2 ) of 0.15, and significance level of 0.05 (5%) for two predictors (Hair et al., 2014 ). Thus, the minimum sample calculated for data collection was 68 cases. However, Bido and Silva (2019) suggest that this value be doubled or tripled to ensure the validity of the estimated model. Thus, the minimum sample for structural equation modeling analyses would be at least 204 cases. It should be noted that the final sample obtained was 254 responses, and the approach to companies was given by electronic means, that is, by online questionnaire. The analysis of the collected data sought to quantitatively identify the factors that motivate agroindustries to adhere to the SDGs. Thus, the Structural Equation Modeling technique (PLS-SEM) was adopted to analyze the measurement and structural models. The Microsoft Excel 2019 software in the tabulation and refinement of the collected data and SmartPLS 3.3.3 was used to interpret and validate the data. Adopting the PLS-SEM technique is justified since its parameters are estimated by a series of least squares regressions (Lee et al., 2011 ). This analysis and modeling technique uses the iterative estimation of parameters in blocks, using latent variables or constructs (LVs) to the detriment of the entire model (Hair et al., 2014 ). Still, it is justified by not requiring data normality and the high capacity to address small samples and complex models (Mateos-Aparicio, 2011 ). A stage before the equation modeling process was performed, consisting of a) verification of missing data (missing values); b) coding and tabulation of the data in the Microsoft Excel software; c) import of the data in the SmartPLS software; and d) outlining of the estimated reflective model for the PLS-SEM analyses.  4 Presentation and discussion of results 4.1 Measurement model The two-stage modeling process (Bido and Silva  2019) or principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the measurement and structural models (Hair et al., 2014 ). This analysis method is used because the indicators of the first-order LVs presented different quantities from each other, making it impossible to use the modeling by repetition of indicators for the second-order LVs. The two-stage modeling process consists of analyzing the factor loads of all indicators and their criterion (<0.7). Thus, it is necessary to obtain the factorial scores of the first-order LVs, save these scores in the original data set, import them into the SmartPLS, and model the second-order LV as if it were a first-order LV, using these scores for its measurement. After PCA, we considered the exclusion of indicators with factor load inferior to 0.7 (<0.7). Then, the two-step modeling process was carried out considering the values of the latent variable scores of each dimension (Bido and Silva  2019). The structural equation modeling model was developed based on the data from the two-stage modeling, as highlighted in Fig. 2  . The values of Cross Loadings were also observed during the analysis of the measurement model. Hair et al. (2014)  highlights that an estimated model has discriminant validity when each of the indicators presents higher loads in its own constructs than in any other LV of the model. The cross loadings analysis process demonstrated that the variables Size (−0.051), Internat (−0.037), and Count_inst_config (−0.356) resulted in negative values for their own dimension. This shows that the indicators may not be adequate for measuring within their dimensions. It also shows the lack of understanding or answers inconsistent with what is sought to measure with the indicator (Bido and Silva, 2019 ). In this case, we chose the exclusion of the indicators by the discriminant validation criterion (Cross lodgings) (Hair et al., 2014 ). Subsequently, the convergent validity and reliability of the estimated model was analyzed by the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) criteria, which measures the percentage of total variance of the indicators explained by the LV (>0.5) and the Composite Reliability (CR) of the latent variables that measure the reliability of the indicators and their LVs (Bido and Silva, 2019 ; Hair et al., 2014 ). In turn, the Fornell and Larcker (1981)  criterion was adopted for the discriminant validation stage, comparing the square roots of the AVE values of each LV with the correlations between the LVs (Henseler et al., 2009 ). Table 5   shows the results of the correlation matrix and discriminant validity (Fornell-Larcker criterion). It also presents the results of reliability and AVE. The results of the discriminant validity evaluation demonstrate that the correlations in all LVs were lower than the square root of the AVE, demonstrating the discriminant validity between them. All the latent variables reached the minimum expected values for AVE and CR, indicating that the estimated model has expected reliability validity. Thus, since all the validation steps of the measurement model were verified and met, we proceeded to validating the structural model, which is presented in the next section.  4.2 Structural model The values of the explained variance (R2 ) of the endogenous variables of the estimated model were adopted to evaluate the explanatory power of the structural model. According to Cohen (1971) , values of R2  = 2% are classified as a small effect, R2  = 13% as a medium effect, and R2  = 26% as a large effect. In this context, it is highlighted that the value of R2  was 0.455, demonstrating values with large effects. The effect size analysis (f2 ) assesses how important each LV is for the adjustment of the estimated model and demonstrated that all LVs had medium and large effect sizes (Bido and Silva  2019). The Stone-Geisser indicator (Q2 ) was used to analyze the predictive validity of the estimated model, evaluating the accuracy of the model, where all LVs presented values above the minimum expected value (Q2  > 0). Finally, the criteria for the structural relationships of the estimated model were evaluated to validate the structural model (Hair et al., 2014 ), as described in Table 6  . The structural coefficient (positive values) was determined by the t-value, requiring values > 2.58 for the estimated model to be adequate with a significance level of 1%, or >1.96 for the model to be adequate with a significance level of 5% to validate the hypotheses elaborated. The results of the significance of the structural relationships elucidate that all the LVs presented positive and significant relationships, confirming the proposed structural relationships. Thus, Hypothesis H1, which analyzes whether the Organizational Attributes of Engagement positively influence the SDGs-PEAA, was confirmed (β = 0.520; p > 0.01). Subsequently, Hypothesis H2, which analyzes whether Institutional Attributes of Engagement positively influence the SDGs-PEAA, was also confirmed (β = 0.216; p > 0.01).  4.3 Discussion of the results Considering the confirmation of Hypotheses H1 and H2 of this study, we proceed to explain the dimensions and indicators that remained for the final model of this study. First, it should be noted that ten among the twelve possible dimensions of organizational attributes that would explain the involvement of agroindustries with the SDGs are presented as significant. Among these attributes, the dimensions “size” and “international negotiations” presented no validity in the analysis, i.e., these characteristics do not explain the commitment of agroindustries to the SDGs. Concerning the construct of institutional attributes for engagement with the SDGs, three of the four possible dimensions for explanation remain in the final model. The “country institutional configuration” dimension is not a driving factor for implementing the SDGs for the agroindustries studied. All six dimensions suggested for analysis were relevant to the construct of PEAA, associated with the SDGs. Thus, the use of the guide prepared by Rede Brasil (2016) , which provides on these principles and suggests the use of respective indicators, is seen as positive, facilitating the measurement of the involvement of companies in the agri-food industrial sector with the SDGs. Fig. 3   synthetically demonstrates the composition of the final framework  for the analysis proposed in this study to identify the driving factors for the engagement of agroindustries with the SDGs. Specifically, to the construct of organizational attributes that affect the commitment to the SDGs, “sustainability initiatives” is treated by several authors as a determining association for the implementation of the SDGs in companies (Bianchi, 2021 ; Escher and Brzustewicz, 2020 ). Sustainability initiatives involve the adoption of environmental, social, and economic actions or practices aimed at the common good, i.e., that reflect positively both for the company and society (van der Waal and Thisjssen, 2020 ) since the SDGs seek the welfare of the collective. The indicator related to the incorporation of social and environmental aspects in the production process is supported by Samper and Quiñones-Ruiz (2017)  and Ockwell et al. (2019) , who affirm that the transformation of the organization towards the adoption of sustainable standards is a relevant practice towards the SDGs, confirmed in the case of the agri-food industries. Finally, there is a commitment to sustainable development as an indicator of sustainability initiatives, confirming the notes of Fleming et al. (2017) , Caiado et al. (2018) , who, in their notes, discuss the direct relationship between sustainability initiatives and the commitment made by companies to the goals of the 2030 Agenda. The breadth of the sustainability theme and the countless initiatives that agroindustries can develop and contribute to the SDGs are observed and exemplify a) social actions: commit to local development, respect human rights and diversities, help local communities to prosper, provide decent work; b) economic actions: guarantee the economic viability of your business, act for the economic stability of farmers and other partners in your chain, promote the conscious consumption of your products; c) environmental actions: responsibility based on soil conservation, preservation of water resources, and mitigation of possible interference in climate change. The authors Martínez-Ferrero and García-Meca (2020)  are mentioned regarding the attribute “governance structure” and its indicator of independent management structure. According to them, the strength of internal governance is a mechanism for engagement with Sustainable Development Goals, either by the independent performance of managers in smaller companies or by the independence of the executive director, presence, and composition of boards in the case of larger companies. “Relationships with interested parties” are indicated in the literature as a driving factor for implementing the SDGs, confirmed in this study through the relationship indicator with public entities (governments at all levels) and other civil society entities (unions, cooperatives, or associations). This indicator is supported by the exposition of Naidoo and Gasparatos (2018)  that the company's engagement with different interested parties is a way to catalyze the SDGs. Pedersen (2018)  corroborates this sense, stating that these interested parties are diverse, both from the private sector and public entities. The “inter-organizational collaboration” dimension refers to the performance of companies with other business or non-business organizations in actions aimed to benefit society or even their isolated insertion that benefit the other entity or collective (Ratajczak-Mrozek, 2017 ). In this sense, the importance of collaborative work in stimulating transformative changes is reinforced (Österblom et al., 2017 ), which is the case of the SDGs, such as with partnerships for projects that seek to solve specific social or environmental problems (Escher and Brzustewicz, 2020 ), involvement with the academic sector for holistic solutions to the problems demanded by the SDGs (Christ and Burritt, 2019 ), or philanthropy actions (Kumi, 2019 ). “Innovation” and its indicators of the creation of new products on an ongoing basis and products created considering environmental and social issues, in addition to economic ones, are identified as determinants for implementing the SDGs (Olabi et al., 2022 ). The results identified in this study align with the exhibitions by Purcell et al. (2019)  and Silva et al. (2019) , who affirm that organizations based on innovation and responsible innovation are determining factors for companies’ engagement with the SDGs. Regarding the “moral behavior” dimension, the non-dependence of external influences for incorporating environmental and social actions or practices in activities is an attribute of the engagement of agroindustries with the SDGs (Borowy, 2021 ). This observation corroborates what Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018)  indicated, that the companies most committed to the SDGs are those more involved with goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda that are actionable within their operations than those outside of it. The “ethical justification” was confirmed as a propelling attribute to the engagement of agroindustries with the SDGs. This dimension is based on the study by Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018) , who state that companies can engage with the SDGs from two perspectives: by the ethical duty to do good or by the ethical duty to avoid damage, for example, due to fines or infractions. The “values” dimension, on the other hand, translates into the company's culture of being responsible for acting in favor of the common good for society, a factor already discussed by Bexell and Jönsson (2017) , Fleming et al. (2017) , and Heras-Saizarbitoria et al. (2022) . In terms of values, it is expected that agribusinesses create, deliver, and share values along the entire food chain, ensuring their commitment to issues relevant to society, such as preservation of local culture and cultural heritage, performance in programs to mitigate any degradation to the land and other natural resources, work for its sustainable rural planning and the stability of its partners, among others aligned with sustainable development. Concerning the “competitiveness” factor, the indicator that refers to the operating sector force for the adoption of actions aimed at sustainable development was also significant for this study. Thus, this criterion is seen as an opportunity for companies to remain competitive by adopting certain sustainable practices, voluntary or not, that will differentiate them from competitors and still contribute to the SDG Agenda (Heras-Saizarbitoria et al., 2022 ; Pedersen, 2018 ). As already discussed by Santos and Bastos (2020) , the issue of adherence to the SDGs is helpful for companies, confirming this fact for the agroindustries studied, here referring to the gains arising from competitiveness and the search for sectoral leadership, i.e., the more responsible competition exists in the sense of integration with the SDGs, the greater the benefits achieved both for agroindustries and for society in general, whether in economic, social, or environmental aspects. Also in organizational terms, the “business model” was presented as relevant in this study. The company's business value proposition being related to economic, social, and environmental issues would be indicative of engagement with the implementation of the SDGs, which confirms the perceptions of Marioka et al. (2017)  and Sullivan et al. (2018)  that sustainable business models are positively associated with adherence to the SDGs and sustainable development. In addition to the organizational attributes of engagement, we begin by explaining the institutional factors that drive the implementation of the SDGs. As shown in Fig. 3 , three dimensions of this construct remained significant for the analysis proposed in this study, highlighting the relevance of the precepts of institutional theory for this empirical application. The first confirmed dimension is “legitimacy”, based on the authors Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018) , Santos and Bastos (2020) , and van der Waal and Thisjssen (2020) , which refers to the search for companies to be recognized both for compliance with laws and legal standards in force or for adaptation to the customs of society. Thus, agroindustries tend to engage with the SDGs due to the positive recognition that this adhesion could result in business recognition before society. The “institutional pressures” concern the environment in which companies are inserted and that condition their activities (Carvalho and Vieira, 2003 ). The indicators observed as relevant in this analysis - laws and regulations influence all actions of the company; values and myths of society influence all activities of the company; and crises (social, economic, political, health/sanitary) affect the activities and results of the company - confirm the results of studies by Cubilla-Montilla et al. (2019) , Mombeuil (2020) , van der Waal and Thisjssen (2020) , and Van Zanten and Van Tulder (2018) , which use the precepts of institutional theory to explain the motivations of companies to engage in the implementation of the SDGs. The “institutionalization” dimension and its indicators that verify whether the company follows the requirements of legislation or regulatory bodies and whether competitors influence it are presented as drivers for the engagement of agroindustries with the SDGs. Institutionalization is related to the procedural form in which companies internalize a given institution, formal or informal, making it usual in their activities (Dimaggio and Powell, 1983 ). In this situation, the SDGs would be considered an institution that could be internalized from different company forms (Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2018 ). It should also be noted that the proposal to analyze the effect of the SDGs was consistent considering the basis of the PEAA (Rede Brasil, 2016 ) for companies in the agri-food industrial sector. According to Fig. 3 , there were significant indicators in all six PEAAs. Thus, the set of SDGs is contemplated in some way in the actions of the agroindustries of the sample since the Sustainable Development Goals are integrated and indivisible. Finally, it is worth reaffirming the relevance of food production and supply to achieve the SDGs. More than ever, the set of SDGs becomes imperative for the sustainable food supply, making the producing companies and all those involved in the food supply chain adhere to established conditions for food production (Govindan, 2018 ). Thus, adopting practices related to sustainable production and food security ensures that the agri-food industry takes an important step in advancing sustainable development (Joshi et al., 2020 ). Not least important, it is possible to affirm the relevance of solid partnerships between agroindustries and other actors for achieving the SDGs, such as with the public sector and educational institutions, the latter being possible determinants for the transfer of knowledge and technology to improve business activities.   5 Final considerations and implications This study aimed to identify the driving factors of the involvement of food agribusinesses in Rio Grande do Sul with the SDGs. Characterized as descriptive and quantitative, the structural equation modeling technique was used to develop this proposal. This analysis was based on the measurement of indicators identified in recent literature as possible determinants of companies' engagement with the SDGs. The SDGs, in turn, were analyzed from their association with the Business Principles for Food and Agriculture (PEAA), created by Rede Brasil (2016) , aiming to guide private companies in the food production sector to adopt solid management strategies and direct them to the global SDG process. The proposition of the study is that engagement with the SDGs can occur from two perspectives: organizational attributes and institutional attributes. Twelve dimensions that could indicate the commitment of agroindustries to the SDGs were tested regarding the organizational attributes, referring to the companies' characteristics. Concerning the institutional attributes of engagement, we sought to measure four dimensions related to external issues to companies arising from the environment in which they are inserted. Ten organizational attributes among those that determine the involvement in the SDGs for this sample of agroindustries are significant: sustainability initiatives, governance structure, relationship with the interested parties, inter-organizational collaboration, innovation, moral behavior, ethical justification, values, competitiveness, and business model. In terms of institutional attributes, three driving factors for involvement in the SDGs were identified: legitimacy, institutional pressures, and institutionalization. The set of engagement attributes - organizational and institutional – reflected in the implementation of certain indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite the partiality of the elements confirmed around the SDGs, all PEAA were included in the analysis, i.e., in some way, the entire set of seventeen SDGs is included in the practices of the agroindustries of this sample. Despite the important observations, this and previous studies have limitations. Regarding the quantitative method adopted in this study, the common method bias stands out, as the sample selected for the analyzes considered only one respondent per organization. One can consider the overfitting required for validating the estimated model (overfitting the estimated model – exclusion of several indicators). In this context, the estimated model should be reviewed in future studies, considering a larger sample with greater data variability to re-validate the estimated model. Therefore, its results should be interpreted with caution when applied in other contexts. 5.1 Implications As highlighted throughout this study, in theoretical and empirical terms, the literature on corporate engagement with the SDGs is at a very early and underdeveloped stage, highlighting the research gap on the specific role of organizations in addressing the SDGs and the impact of this initiative on their practice. Therefore, the results found in this study contribute to advance theoretically-empirically in this field of knowledge. Such advances are translated by the application of the study in a sample composed of companies in the same field of activity (agroindustries); empirical use of the PEAA guide in the context of academic-scientific research; theoretical consolidation of the attributes of corporate engagement with the SDGs; empirical identification of the factors driving the involvement of agroindustries with the SDGs, the main objective of this study; and finally, development of research in Brazil, considered unprecedented so far. Thus, understanding the opportunities provided by this field of knowledge allows us to suggest the continuity of research on the engagement of companies with the SDGs, with the same type of company and considering other activities. Comparative studies between companies from different regions of the country or between different types of companies would also add new understandings to this topic. It should also be noted that, in addition to the engagement of the business environment with the SDGs, research that demonstrates the involvement of other interested parties in the 2030 Agenda is promising, both practically and scientifically. The results found have managerial implications for the agro-food industry. The analysis suggests several organizational and institutional factors that favorably influence the engagement of agroindustries with the SDGs. In this sense, the owners or managers of these companies must be proactive in developing practices that align them and contribute to sustainable development, favoring their returns and business opportunities.
