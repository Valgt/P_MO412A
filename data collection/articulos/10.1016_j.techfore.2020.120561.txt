                  This paper extends prior studies on sustainable entrepreneurship by proving how the impact of entrepreneurial activity on achieving sustainable development depends on the behaviors and motivations of entrepreneurs. More precisely, we examine the influence of opportunity and necessity driven entrepreneurs on the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, which are constructed based on the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Using data for twenty developing countries, we find from the long-run estimates that opportunity entrepreneurship has a positive impact on the three dimensions of sustainable development, whereas necessity entrepreneurship has a negative effect on the environmental sustainability dimension. We also find from the short and long-run causality analyses that opportunity-driven entrepreneurs granger cause the three dimensions in the short and long-run, whereas necessity-driven entrepreneurs do not have any effect on these dimensions. Finally, the authors make some suggestions for further research in this area.

More precisely, we examine the influence of opportunity and necessity driven entrepreneurs on the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, which are constructed based on the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Using data for twenty developing countries, we find from the long-run estimates that opportunity entrepreneurship has a positive impact on the three dimensions of sustainable development, whereas necessity entrepreneurship has a negative effect on the environmental sustainability dimension. We also find from the short and long-run causality analyses that opportunity-driven entrepreneurs granger cause the three dimensions in the short and long-run, whereas necessity-driven entrepreneurs do not have any effect on these dimensions. Finally, the authors make some suggestions for further research in this area.   Keywords Opportunity entrepreneurship  Necessity entrepreneurship  SDGS  Developing countries    1 Introduction The sustainable development goals (SDGs), with the 17 goals and 169 targets, constitute today the most broadly accepted agenda for achieving sustainable development (General Assembly, 2015). The SDGs are built based on the famous call for sustainable development in the Brundtland Report, provided by the UN World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in1987, and enlarge the incomplete Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by creating the world's first set of goals tackling the economic, social, and environmental aspects of sustainability. Today they offer the legitimate policy agenda on which policymakers, entrepreneurs, and civil society can plan, measure, and announce their contributions to sustainable development. The 17 SDGs call for an urgent need to rethink the path of the unsustainable development that humanity pursuing today (Horne et al., 2020). According to the UN General Assembly (2015), humanity should take the “bold and transformative steps that are urgently needed to shift the world on to a sustainable and resilient path”. Entrepreneurs were cited as a vehicle of this transformation (Schumpeter, 1934 , Drucker, 1985; Matos and Hall, 2007; York and Venkataraman, 2010; Loorbach and Wijsman, 2013 ; UN General Assembly, 2016 ; Ben Youssef et al., 2018 ; Omri, 2018 ; Horne et al., 2020). Within their businesses, entrepreneurs should focus more on business ideas that serve to balance their activities with the economic, environmental, and social impacts of their activities and engaging in sustainable practices in their search of competitiveness and efficiency in the components of sustainable development (Perrini et al., 2007). So, it is interesting to know whether and in which domains new businesses support the change towards sustainable products and services. The last few years showed an increasing amount of studies focusing on the link between entrepreneurial activity and sustainable development (e.g., Sheperd and Patzel, 2011; Harms et al., 2014 ; Ratinho et al., 2015 ; Rahdari et al., 2016 ; Ben Youssef et al., 2018 ; Horne et al., 2020; Omri and Afi, 2020). For instance, Hall et al. (2010)  propose entrepreneurship as a solution to environmental issues and leads to sustainable economic growth. According to the authors, entrepreneurship is an important vehicle for driving change towards sustainable processes and products, with many high-level scholars advocating entrepreneurial activity as a solution to several environmental and social problems. Sheperd and Patzel (2011) also document that entrepreneurship can preserve the ecosystem, mitigate climate change and environmental pollution, enhance agricultural practices, and preserve biodiversity. In the same spirit, Omri (2018)  considers entrepreneurship as the most potent tool for producing sustainable goods and services and implementing new businesses that address many social and environmental interests. Using data for 66 countries, he finds that the link between entrepreneurship and environmental sustainability depends on the stage of economic development. Using data for 17 African countries, Ben Youssef et al. (2018)  also show that the link between entrepreneurship and sustainable development strongly depends on the levels of innovation capacity and institutions quality in these countries. Yet, despite that entrepreneurship is recognized as a tool for achieving a more sustainable economy, as so far as we know the question of whether the link between the entrepreneurial activity and sustainable development depends on the behavior and motivations of entrepreneurs (opportunity entrepreneurship versus necessity entrepreneurship) has never been addressed previously. Moreover, since the SDGs call for achieving the economic, social, and environmental sustainability, especially in developing economies, none of the existing studies have interested in examining the impact of the behavior of opportunity and necessity driven entrepreneurs on achieving the economic, social, and environmental goals of sustainable development. To fill these gaps, the objective of this research article was to increase our understanding to what extent the contributions of entrepreneurship on achieving the SDGs differ across the behavior of entrepreneurs. We tackle this issue using data for twenty developing economies over the period 2004–2017. In that way, to our knowledge, this study has three principal contributions. First, it appears that while entrepreneurial activity is recently being discussed as a key tool for achieving sustainable development, there is much uncertainty regarding the contribution of entrepreneurship to achieving the 17 SDGs. As an extension of the work of Dhahri and Omri (2018) , who only examined the contribution of the total entrepreneurship on one indicator by dimension of sustainable development, and based on the theoretical classification of the 17 SGDs suggested by Costanza et al. (2016) , this study contributes by examining the influence of entrepreneurial activity on achieving the economic, social, and environmental SDGs in the case of developing countries. Costanza et al. (2016)  divide the 17 SDGs into three main dimensions of sustainable development, where each dimension is associated with some specific goals. Specifically, the authors suggest that (i) economic sustainability is associated with goals 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12; (ii) social sustainability includes goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 16, and 17; (iii) environmental sustainability is associated with goals 6, 13, 14, and 15. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and based on this classification, we built three indices corresponding to these three dimensions: economic sustainability index, social sustainability index, and environmental sustainability index. To our knowledge, this study is the first that examines the relationship between entrepreneurial activity and these dimensions. Second, we also extend the existing literature by showing how this relationship varies across the behaviors and motivations of entrepreneurs. More precisely, we examine the effect of opportunity and necessity driven entrepreneurs on achieving the SDGs. Third, in terms of results, we find that the linkage between entrepreneurship and sustainable development depends on the behaviors and motivations of entrepreneurs. Following the introduction, we present the theoretical background and related literature on the relationship between entrepreneurship and sustainable development. Then, we outline the data and the empirical methodology, we present and discuss our empirical results, and we conclude and offer some policy implications.  2 Theoretical background and related literature 2.1 Sustainable development goals The emergence of the concept of sustainable development occurs in the 1987 report from the UN World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), in a document entitled “Our Common Future.” They stated that achieving development requires “meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs” (WCED, 1987 ). In the aftermath, sustainable development has focused largely on enhancing adaptive capacities of creating opportunities to achieve the desired social, economic, and ecological systems for the sake of present and future generations. In 2015, the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) adopted ‘‘Agenda for Sustainable Development”. The agenda is intended to be achieved by 2030 (United Nations, 2015 ). The SDGs provide the long-term sustainable development of human society as a whole, and their adoption was the result of the failure of countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of 2000. The SDGs have been widely recognized as a complex phenomenon that encompasses three major dimensions for achieving sustainable progress: the environment, the society and the economy. In this context, Costanza et al. (2016)  divide the 17 SDGs into three main dimensions of sustainable development (Sustainable scale: natural capital, Fair distribution: social capital, and Efficient allocation: economy capital), where each dimension is associated with specific goals. Specifically, the authors suggest that (i) economic sustainability is associated with goals 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12; (ii) societal sustainability includes goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 16, and 17; (iii) environmental sustainability is related to goals 6, 13, 14, and 15. Thus, we follow this classification to build three indices for these three dimensions, namely economic sustainability index, social sustainability index, and environmental sustainability index). Before presenting the calculating procedures, it is essential to define each of these dimensions. 2.1.1 Economic sustainability The concept of “conomic sustainability” is defined as a system of production that meets the needs of the current consumption without compromising future needs (Lobo et al., 2015 ). According to Basiago (1996 , 1999 ) and Du and Kang (2016) , the increasing size of the economic system has exhausted the stock of natural resources, which, in turn, prompted to take another look at the adopted traditional economic methods. After the excessive consumption of natural resources in favor of economic development, it has been perceived that natural resources are limited and for the most part of them are non-renewable. Consequently, many academics have been driven to ask about the feasibility of excessive consumption of natural resources toward economic growth. Economic growth is the main concern of economic powers by increasing demand for goods and services in pushing markets without taking into account their destructive effects on the environment, such as depletion and pollution (Retchless and Brewer, 2016 ; UNSD, 2018). According to Zhai and Chang (2019) , economic sustainability requires a set of decisions that must be made up in a fair way, taking into account other aspects of sustainability, such as the preservation of the environment. For that reason, the Paris accords is a signed agreement between 196 countries who have agreed to modify their economic growth by moving towards a more “ecologically sustainable’ growth models (Ben Youssef et al., 2020 ; Piñeiro-Chousa et al., 2021). The representatives of 196 countries agreed to reduce the global warming to less than 2 °C in order to limit the danger of climate change (Wu et al., 2020 ).  2.1.2 Social sustainability The concept of "social sustainability" is related to people, this approach includes many topics, such as social equity, livelihoods, cultural identity, community development, and institutional stability (Daly, 1992 ; Benaim and Raftis, 2008 ). Social sustainability promotes the development of individuals, societies, and cultures to accomplish a satisfactory social life, relying on good health care and education quality, gender equality, peace, and stability around the world (Saith, 2006 ). Guo (2017)  claims that social sustainability embraces major issues, such as those related to human rights, public participation, rule of law and justice for peace and social stability. The aim of social sustainability is not to ensure everyone's needs, but to provide favorable conditions to meet their needs, if they so desire (Kolk, 2016). Pierobon (2019) argues, in this direction, that any action that would impede this ability is considered a barrier and must be addressed for social sustainability progress. Nevertheless, some other researchers highlight the difficulty of achieving “social sustainability” because the social system sounds complex and strongly intangible compared to the “economic sustainability” and “environmental sustainability” where capital flows and economic system are visible (Benaim and Raftis, 2008 ; Saner et al., 2019 ).  2.1.3 Environmental sustainability The concept of “environmental sustainability” revolves around a responsible interaction with the ecosystem to remain productive and renewable to support the future of humankind with long-term environmental quality. Evers (2018)  documents, in this context, that ecosystems must be regenerative by consuming natural resources in proportion to their regeneration and that wastes have to be emitted in a way that the environment can assimilate. This is because the uncontrolled growth puts pressure on the Earth system would disrupt the maintenance of the Earth's equilibrium (ICSU, 2017 ). Therefore, there is much evidence to support concerns about environmental sustainability (Gilding, 2017). Moreover, the effects of climate change are associated with the need for environmental sustainability. Climate change is the result of natural climate variability or by human activities that have significant and long-term side effects on the climate system (Kummer, 1979). These side effects covering atmospheric greenhouse concentrations, seas warming, decreasing Antarctic land ice levels, and consequently a rise in sea level, increasing ocean acidification and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations (Du and Kang, 2016 ).   2.2 Entrepreneurship for sustainable development 2.2.1 Entrepreneurship and economic sustainability A growing body of research highlighted the key role of entrepreneurship in promoting economic growth and development challenges (Shumpeter, 1934; Romer, 1990 ; Kirchhoff, 1992 ; Harrison, 1994; Storey, 1994 ; Birsh et al., 1997; Acs et al., 2004 ; Headd and Kirchholff, 2009; Kirchhoff et al., 2013 ). For instance, Schumpeter (1934)  proposes that increasing the level of entrepreneurial activities would foster economic growth. He argued that entrepreneurship serves to introduce new factors into the economy and that the role of the entrepreneur is to raise the production function upwards. According to Kirshholff (1992), entrepreneurial activity is fundamental for creating wealth and equitable distribution via a dynamic process of new venture formation and growth. For Acs et al. (2004) , entrepreneurship is a process that transforms knowledge into growth. Romer (1990)  established a model to develop new products in two processes. The first process is that the incumbents carry out research and development (R&D) activities by employing researchers who are responsible for generating new knowledge, which in turn converts into growth. The second process consists that the incomplete commercialized new knowledge by incumbent operators, potential opportunities are created for entrepreneurs to set up new businesses to exploit the knowledge that would otherwise not be commercialized (Audretsch 2007). In the same spirit, Acs and Varga (2005)  analyze the impact of the two types of entrepreneurs on growth and economic development. They show that the effect of these types varies widely, while necessity entrepreneurship does not affect economic development and opportunity entrepreneurship has a significant positive effect. Kirchholff et al. (2013) argue that new businesses, especially new high technology ventures with disruptive technologies, are vital for job creation and contribute to distributing wealth. Recently, Angulo-Guerrero et al. (2017)  show that economic development positively affects entrepreneurship opportunity, but it is negatively associated with necessity entrepreneurship in OECD countries over the 2001–2012 period. Using fourteen different indicators of entrepreneurship, Doran et al. (2018) investigate the impact of entrepreneurial activity, aspirations, and attitudes on economic growth for 55 economies. Their findings reveal that entrepreneurial activity stimulates economic growth in high-income economies, whereas it has a negative contribution in the cases of middle- and low-income economies. For the case of OECD countries, Galindo-Martín et al. (2021)  study the role of entrepreneurial activity in fostering economic growth in the three stages (expansion, crises, and subsequent recovery) and pre-crisis periods (2004–2006); Economic crisis period, (2008–2010); recovery period from the crisis (2014–2016). They show a positive association between entrepreneurship and growth in the three stages.  2.2.2 Entrepreneurship and social sustainability The values added of entrepreneurship to society are connected to so-called ‘Schumpeterian entrepreneurs’ – referring to Schumpeter's early theory on ‘creative destruction’ (Schumpeter, 1934 , 1942). In his understanding, innovative entrepreneurs can be a source of regional and individual wealth generation as well as social progress (Aghion and Howeitt, 1992; Chavez et al., 2017 ). In the same spirit, Birch (1979)  cites entrepreneurship as a key driver of job creation and a single source of new job growth in both developing and developing countries. Moreover, Lippmann et al. (2005)  show that countries with high-income inequality have higher rates of entrepreneurial activity because they have an excess of capital to invest in new businesses. Besides, most of the population who has scarce financial resources becomes self-employed because it is the only viable form of employment for them. Similarly, Rupasingha and Goetz (2013) show that self-employment alleviates poverty in rural and urban areas of the United States in the short-run. Using data from 76 provinces of Thailand in 2000 and 2005, Yanya et al. (2013)  examines the relationship between entrepreneurship, poverty, and income inequality. The author finds that entrepreneurship reduces poverty and inequality. Itri et al. (2015)  also demonstrate that entrepreneurship can help improve the quality of healthcare products and services with better health outcomes and lower costs. In the same spirit, Dhahri and Omri (2018)  show that new venture creation increases the national modified human development index (MHDI) in 20 developing countries over the 2001–2012 period. Using data for Chinese entrepreneurs, Namine et al. (2018) find a statistically significant and positive relationship between entrepreneurship and poverty reduction. Recently, Lecuna (2019)  documents that public policies addressed to formal and informal entrepreneurs decrease income distribution inequalities in 54 countries over the 2006–2012 period.  2.2.3 Entrepreneurship and environmental sustainability Previous studies on environmental quality confirm that entrepreneurship is one of the ways to achieve environmental sustainability. For instance, York and Venkataraman (2010) argue that entrepreneurs can help solve environmental problems by, on the one hand, helping existing institutions to achieve their goals and, on the other hand, creating new services and institutions by doing things that existing institutions do not and cannot do. In a similar context, Shepherd and Batzel (2011) document that entrepreneurship can reduce environmental and forest degradation, preserving natural capital by improving freshwater supply and agricultural activities. Similarly, Swan and Morgan (2016)  argue that within the ecotourism businesses, entrepreneurs should competing objectives relating to business activities, lifestyle aspirations, and, most significantly, sustainable development practices. Ben Youssef et al. (2018)  also confirm that entrepreneurs are aware of the existence of a potential market for "green" products and services. However, empirical research shows that entrepreneurship can also have detrimental effects on environmental sustainability. Recently, Jinjiang et al. (2020)  confirm that entrepreneurship can protect the ecosystem, improve agricultural practices, reduce environmental deforestation, improve freshwater supply and biodiversity, and improve environmental quality. They argue that opportunity-based entrepreneurship is positively related to the environmental quality of sustainable development. Opportunity entrepreneurship can be a solution to environmental degradation and climate change. However, Omri (2018)  find that entrepreneurship dramatically increases the amount of national CO2  emissions. He also shows that there is no linear or inverted U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurship and CO2  emissions. In the same spirit, Omri and Afi (2020) examine the conjoint effect of education and four different forms of entrepreneurship (opportunity, necessity, formal and informal entrepreneurship) on achieving environmental sustainability for 32 developing countries. Their findings show that these four types of entrepreneurship increase environmental degradation and that both informal entrepreneurship and necessity entrepreneurship has the higher impact on air pollution. They also demonstrated that education moderates the negative effects of all forms of entrepreneurship on the quality of the environment. In light of this discussion, it is clear that none of the previous studies have empirically examined the association between behavioral entrepreneurship and achieving the 17 SDGs. Specifically, none of them have examined the contribution of the opportunity and necessity driven entrepreneurs on achieving the economic, social, and environmental SDGs.    3 Data and empirical methodology 3.1 Data sources and indicators calculation As mentioned above, the aim of this paper is to investigate the contributions of behavioral entrepreneurship on the three dimensions of sustainable development in the case of twenty developing countries for the period 2004–2017.1  1 The selection of countries and the period of study were chosen according to the availability of data.   Specifically, we examine the impacts of Total Early-stage entrepreneurship (TEA), opportunity entrepreneurship (OppTEA), and necessity entrepreneurship (NecTEA) on economic, social and environmental sustainability. The TEA refers to the percentage of individuals who manage or own a business less than 42 months old (Reynolds et al., 2001 ). OppTEA refers to the percentage of individuals who have voluntarily committed to pursuing a profitable business opportunity; however, NecTEA indicates the percentage of individuals who are motivated to start a business because they did not found other better alternatives to work (Reynolds et al., 2001 ). The data on these three variables were acquired from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) database. As shown below, the economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability indices are calculated on the basis of the 17 SDOs. All the data on the indicators of these 17 goals, with the exception of goal 10, were sourced from the World Bank World Development (WDI) database. The indicator related to goal 10 was collected from the Standard World Income Inequality Database (SWIID). The remainder of this sub-section is divided into two parts. The first outlines the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied in the construction of the indices measuring the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. The second one describes the developed indicators. 3.1.1 Construction of the sustainable development dimensions: principal component analysis The Brundtland Commission first introduced the concept of sustainable development in 1987. It includes three dimensions that describe development in its economic, social, and environmental aspects. The PCA and SDGs data for the 20 sample countries are used to construct composite indices measuring the three aspects of sustainable development. A composite index is a synthetic indicator of a set of valued individual indicators that do not have a common unit of measurement. Each composite indicator can be considered a model, it is developed for a specific purpose and its construction must follow a series of steps to be useful and generally accepted (Kondyli, 2010 ). These steps include the following:• Formulation of a theoretical framework : At the United Nations Rio + 20 Summit in 2012, governments commit to creating a set of sustainable development objectives integrated into the follow-up of the Millennium Development Goals. On this occasion, the General Assembly of the United Nations officially adopts the "Agenda for Sustainable Development to 2030″, which includes 17 sustainable development goals (United Nations, 2015 ). According to Sachs (2012) , the sustainable development goals "aim to combine economic development, environmental sustainability and social inclusion". To better understand and measure sustainable development, Costanza et al. (2016)  classify the 17 SDGs under three dimensions (Table 1  ). In the absence of such data, as noted by Barbier and Burgess (2019) , it is difficult to select an adequate indicator or group of indicators for each objective and to access reliable data for that indicator.  • Imputing missing data:  For a composite indicator to be robust, in the case of missing data, imputation techniques must be used.  Three possible methods for finding missing data: (a) omission of observations with missing data, (b) single imputation (replacement by the mean) and (c) multiple imputations (e.g., Monte Carlo algorithm). In our papers, we use single imputation (replacement by the mean).  • Standardization of data:  some indicators can be positively correlated with the phenomenon to be measured, while others can be negatively correlated with it. In this case, we must standardize the indicators so that an increase in the standardized indicators corresponds to an increase in the composite index. According to (JRC-EC, 2008 ), there are different methods of standardization. We use the MIN MAX method.    Data standardization (Min–Max) was carried out according to the following formulas:(1) X t , i , j   = X t , i , j  ′  − X t , min , j  ′   X t , max , j  ′  − X t , min , j  ′        (2) X t , i , j   = 1 − X t , i , j  ′  − X t , min , j  ′   X t , max , j  ′  − X t , min , j  ′        Where X t , i , j     is the observed value for variable i measured on spatial unit j in year t X  t , m i n , j  ′    , X  t , m a x , j  ′     are the minimum and maximum values of variable i measured in all spatial units. The first equation is applied to variables having a positive relationship with durability, while the second has been applied to variables having a negative relationship with durability, as shown in Table 2  .• Weighting and aggregation:  Weighting and aggregation of the component of the composite indicator is one of the most important steps in the whole process (Kondyli, 2010 ). After standardization of the original data, the weighting of the different indicators in the composite indicator is performed to give more or less importance to the various indicators. To complete this step, we use Principal Component Analysis (JRC-EC, 2008 ). This common statistical method is used to reduce a greater set of correlated variables to a lesser set of uncorrelated variables, called principal components, which explain much of the variation in an original dataset. The objective of PCA is to explain the observed data variance by linear combinations of the original data (Abou-Ali and Abdelfattah, 2013 ).    The general form of a principal component can be expressed as follows:(3) P C p  = b 1 p  X 1 p  + … + b n p  X n p      Where P C p     is the principal component,b n p    andX n p    are, respectively, the regression coefficient for the n variables of the P  th   component, and the value of the n variables.  3.1.2 Developed indicators using PCA In the PCA analysis, prior to the storage of the principal components various test statistics were conducted to evaluate the adequacy of the representative data. These included the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy, with values > 0.50 deemed appropriate for PCA. Bartlett's Test of Sphericity should be the significance level with values below 0.5 (p  <0.5) for PCA (Abou-Ali and Abdelfattah, 2013 ). To extract the number of main components, two criteria are used. First, we choose the cumulative variance in which at least 60–70% of the total information is explained, second, the Kaiser criterion (Kaiser, 1960 ), which makes it possible to retain the main components having an eigenvalue greater than one. As shown in Table 3  , the social dimension is calculated using two selected CPs (social1 and social2) explaining 64.256% of the total variance. Second, the economic dimension is examined using the two-selected PC (economic1 and economic2), accounting for 69.184% of the total variation. Finally, the environmental sustainability index is evaluated by two PCs (envirnmt1 and envirnmt2), which explain 67.285% of the total variance. After calculating the factors for each distinct dimension of sustainability, the methodology of e Bregar et al. (2008)  is used to calculate the development index for each dimension. It is based on the use of the weighted average of the selected PCs as follows:(4) I p  = ∑ i = 1  m  F P i   * λ i   ∑ i = 1  m  λ i        Where Ip  corresponds to the Sustainability Index, which is a weighted average of m PC values for the unit p. Fpi  denotes the value of the I  th    PC for the unit p, while λ i   corresponds to the Eigenvalue of the I  th   PC. The equations for calculating these indices are as follows:Economic dimension =  ( 2 . 297 * economic 1 + 1  . 162 * economic 2   )  / 3  . 459      Social dimension =  ( 3 . 713 * social 1 + 1  . 427 * social 2 + 1  . 24323   )  / 5  . 14      Environnemental dimension =  ( 1 . 416 * envirnmt 1 + 1  . 275 * envirnmt 2   )  / 2  . 691         3.2 Estimation procedures We use a four-step empirical methodology to explore the relationship between behavioral entrepreneurial activities and the dimensions of sustainable development: (i) checking the cross-sectional dependence (DC) for residuals using various statistical tests and examine the stationary properties of our variables, (ii) test for the presence of cointegration among the variables, (iii) estimating the long-term linkages between variables, and (v) examining the short- and long-term causality between the indicators of entrepreneurship indicators and these dimensions.   4 Empirical results and discussions We begin our analyses by checking the presence of cross-sectional dependence (CD) in our data using three statistical tests: Friedman (1937) ; Frees (1995); Pesaran (2004 , 2015). As shown in Table 4  , the null hypothesis of cross-section independence is rejected for the three considered tests, indicating that the first-generation panel unit root tests could produce biased results (Apergis and Payne, 2014 ). For this reason, it is appropriate to apply the second-generation panel unit root tests (Chudik et al., 2011 ). We use, therefore, a cross-section augmented IPS (CIPS) unit root test, which accounts for the existence of cross-section dependence. Furthermore, this table shows that all the variables are statistically significant in first differences, indicating that all variables are integrated with the same order 1 (I(1)). The same order of integration of the variables allows us to check, using the Westerlund's (2007) panel cointegration test, whether there are long-term relationships between the variables. The results of Table 5   show the reject of the null hypothesis of the absence of cointegration between all the variables. After confirming that all the variables are cointegrated, we estimate, in the next step, the long-run relationships between TEA, opportunity entrepreneurship, necessity entrepreneurship and three dimensions of sustainable development using FMOLS and DOLS estimators. Table 6   contains three panels (TEA, OppTEA, and NecTEA), where, each panel contains four equations. Four main results could be derived from the TEA panel. The first equation related to TEA shows, as expected, that two dimensions of sustainable development exert positive effects on TEA. First, we find that the impact of economic sustainability on TEA is positive and statistically significant at a 1% level for both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. This result is in with the findings of Galindo and Mendez (2014) who find, in the case of 13 advanced economies, that economic activity supports TEA by creating new business opportunities for entrepreneurs, providing products with a higher degree of competitiveness, and stimulating innovation. Second, social sustainability positively contributes to TEA for both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. The second equation related to economic sustainability shows that TEA and social sustainability have positive spillover effects on economic sustainability. On the one hand, the impact of TEA on economic sustainability is positive and significant for the FMOLS estimator. Based on the results of Aquino et al. (2018), Tourism Social Entrepreneurship (TSE) is proposed as a more comprehensive market-based sustainable community development strategy to address social problems and create social value while generating profit. This is done through the implementation of social innovation activities that encourage active community participation to create a tourism industry that promotes sustainable development outcomes. Moreover, we find a positive impact of social sustainability on economic sustainability at a 1% level for both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. Besides, environmental sustainability is having an insignificant effect on economic sustainability for both estimators. Additionally, the third equation shows a positive and significant impact of economic sustainability on social sustainability for both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. Like economic sustainability, environmental sustainability has a positive contribution to social sustainability at a 1% level for the DOLS estimator. On the other hand, the fourth equation shows that the impact of TEA on environmental sustainability is positive and statistically significant at a 1% level. This result is in line with Omri (2018)  who finds that entrepreneurial activity initially degrades the environment, but after a certain level, it improves environmental quality. The author confirms that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between entrepreneurship and air pollution. Furthermore, economic sustainability and social sustainability have positive and statistically significant impacts at a 1% level for both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. Regarding the OppTEA panel, we find, in the first equation related to opportunity entrepreneurship, that the dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social, and environmental) exert positive effects on opportunity entrepreneurship. First, we show that the impact of economic sustainability on opportunity entrepreneurship is positive and significant for the DOLS estimator. This result suggests that high country risk scores (CRS),2  2 Country Risk Scores (CRS) measures divers’ quantitative and qualitative factors about the current situation of a country in terms of political, structural, economic, and financial assessment; also it determines rating country risk.   per capita growth, level of development of industry, innovation, and infrastructure i.e. SDG9, reduction of inequalities i.e. SDG10 and responsible consumption, and production value i.e. SDG12 promote opportunity-driven entrepreneurship (Cervelló-Royo et al., 2019 ). Second, social sustainability has a positive and significant impact on opportunity entrepreneurship is at a 1% level for the FMOLS and DOLS estimators. This result confirms the outcomes of Rietveld et al. (2015)  that business owners who have good mental health run their businesses in a good way because they have skills, knowledge, and experience, unafraid of failure, which is needed to increase the promising opportunities in their own business. Third, we find that environmental sustainability has a positive and significant impact on opportunity entrepreneurship for the FMOLS estimator. This result is consistent with the findings of Ajide (2020)  for the case of 20 African countries. These authors suggest that African governments should invest in infrastructures such as water and sanitation, transportation facilities, electricity, ICT to encourage entrepreneurship opportunities that can improve economic development, reduce unemployment and boost productivity to achieve sustainable development in Africa. Moreover, the economic sustainability equation shows that social sustainability and environmental sustainability have positive and statistically significant impacts on economic sustainability at 10% and 1% levels, respectively, for FMOLS and DOLS estimators. We also find that opportunity entrepreneurship positively contributes to economic sustainability at 1% level for both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. This result is in line with Angulo-Guerrero and al. (2017), which confirm that the level of economic development in OECD countries seems to be positively associated with entrepreneurship opportunity and negatively with necessity entrepreneurship. Acs and Varga (2005)  also analyze the impacts of opportunity and necessity entrepreneurs on economic growth and development and their findings show that the effect of these types varies widely: while necessity entrepreneurship does not affect economic development, opportunity entrepreneurship has a significant positive effect. In addition, the social sustainability equation shows that opportunity entrepreneurship positively contributes to social sustainability for both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. This result is in line with the findings of Namine et al. (2018) who find that entrepreneurship reduces poverty. Similarly, Naudé and Gries (2011) argue that entrepreneurial activity stimulates human capital. Finally, the environmental sustainability equation, as expected, we find that opportunity entrepreneurship has a positive and statistically significant impact on environmental sustainability at 1% and 5% levels, respectively, for the FMOLS and DOLS estimators. This result indicates that opportunity-based entrepreneurship has a positive impact on environmental sustainability through the moderating role of institutional quality (Jinjiang et al., 2020 ). For the NecTEA panel, we find, in the first equation related to necessity entrepreneurship, that the impact of economic sustainability on necessity entrepreneurship is negative and significant for both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. This result is in line with Nikolaev et al. (2018) who find that economic growth is a weakly robust determinant of necessity entrepreneurship in the case of 73 economies. In addition, the economic sustainability equation shows that only social sustainability and environmental sustainability that have positive effects on economic sustainability at 1% level using both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. However, necessity entrepreneurship shows an insignificant impact on economic sustainability. This result is in line with Acs and Varga (2005)  use data for 11 countries and find that opportunity-driven entrepreneurship positively contributes to economic development, whereas necessity-driven entrepreneurship has no impact. For the third equation related to social sustainability, as shown in the TEA panel, we find that only economic sustainability that has a positive and statistically significant impact on social sustainability. Similarly, in the environmental sustainability equation, economic sustainability contributes positively to environmental sustainability for both FMOLS and DOLS estimators. While necessity entrepreneurship negatively contributes to environmental sustainability, this confirms the findings of Omri and Afi (2020) for the case of 32 developing countries. It is clear from the above-discussed results that (i) Early-Stage entrepreneurship contributes only to economic and environmental sustainability, (ii) opportunity entrepreneurship is a key factor for stimulating the three dimensions of sustainable development, and (iii) necessity entrepreneurship contributes negatively to environmental sustainability. Figs. 1  , 2  , and 3   summarize the findings related to the short and long-run causality tests given in Table 7  . These results corroborate the four-way linkages between different types of entrepreneurship (in particular, early-stage entrepreneurship, opportunity entrepreneurship, and necessity entrepreneurship) and three dimensions of sustainable development, namely economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. For the short-run relationships, we find, in model 1 related to early-stage entrepreneurship, bidirectional causality between TEA and economic sustainability and a bidirectional causal relationship was found between TEA and social sustainability. These results indicate that there is a complementary relationship between entrepreneurship and economic sustainability and between entrepreneurship and social sustainability. Moreover, we find a unidirectional causality running from environmental sustainability to social sustainability. However, we find the neutrality relationship between TEA and environmental sustainability. In addition, a neutrality relationship was found between economic sustainability and environmental sustainability and between social sustainability and economic sustainability. In model 2, there is bidirectional causality between opportunity entrepreneurship and economic sustainability. Moreover, there is bidirectional causality between social sustainability and opportunity entrepreneurship. There is a unidirectional causality running from opportunity entrepreneurship to environmental sustainability. Furthermore, we find unidirectional causality running from economic sustainability to social sustainability. Nevertheless, we find a neutrality relationship between economic sustainability and environmental sustainability and between environmental sustainability and social sustainability. In model 3 related to necessity entrepreneurship, there exists a unidirectional impact running from economic sustainability to necessity entrepreneurship. Besides, there is a neutrality relationship between necessity entrepreneurship, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. Also, a neutrality relationship was found between economic sustainability and social sustainability and between economic sustainability and environmental sustainability. Similarly, it was found that there is a unidirectional causality ruining from environmental sustainability to social sustainability. For the long-run relationships, we find in model 1 that there is (i) bidirectional causality relationship between TEA and social sustainability, between TEA and economic sustainability, and between economic sustainability and social sustainability (ii) unidirectional impact running from environmental sustainability to TEA, economic sustainability and social sustainability. In model 2, the findings show (i) bidirectional causality between opportunity entrepreneurship, economic sustainability and social sustainability, and between economic sustainability and social sustainability; (ii) unidirectional impact running from environmental sustainability to opportunity entrepreneurship, economic sustainability, and social sustainability. In model 3, we find (i) bidirectional causality between economic sustainability and social sustainability; (ii) unidirectional causality running from environmental sustainability to social sustainability and economic sustainability; neutrality relationship between necessity entrepreneurial activities and the three dimensions of sustainable development. Regarding the short and long-run relationships, we can conclude that (i) TEA granger cause the three dimensions of sustainable development in the long-run and the economic and social dimension in the short-run; (ii) opportunity entrepreneurship granger cause the three dimensions of sustainable development in the short and long-run; (iii) necessity entrepreneurship does not have any effect of these dimensions in both short and long-run. In summary, both the long-run estimates and the short and long-run causality relationships show that the contribution of entrepreneurial activity on achieving sustainable development differs across the behavior of entrepreneurs, i.e. opportunity-driven and necessity-driven. Specifically, those only opportunity-driven entrepreneurs may contribute to achieving the SDGs in developing countries. This conclusion is in line with the findings of Jinjiang et al. (2020)  who argue that opportunity-based entrepreneurship is positively related to environmental sustainability and sustainable development.  5 Conclusion and policy implications Entrepreneurship has been acknowledged as a channel to achieve sustainable development, particularly in the developing world. Despite its importance in the current academic and policy circles, the link between them remains unclear. This inquiry is a contribution to this focus by examining the contribution of behavioral entrepreneurship in achieving the SDGs. Specifically, we demonstrated how the relationship between entrepreneurial activity and the three dimensions of sustainable development varies across the behaviors and motivations of entrepreneurs (opportunity-driven and necessity-driven). FMOLS and DOLS estimators and VECM Granger causality test are used to examining this relationship for 20 developing countries of the period 2004–2017. Our empirical analysis offers interesting results with regard to the sustainability process. First, from the long-run estimates, we find that early-stage entrepreneurship only contributes to the economic and environmental sustainability. We also find that opportunity entrepreneurship a positive effect on the three dimensions of sustainable development, whereas necessity entrepreneurship affects negatively environmental sustainability. Second, we have shown, from the short and long-run causality, that early-stage entrepreneurship granger causes the three dimensions of sustainable development in the long run and the economic and social dimension in the short run. We also showed that opportunity entrepreneurship granger causes the three dimensions in the short and long-run; whereas necessity entrepreneurship does not have any effect on these dimensions in the short and long-run. Third, these results show that the potential impact of entrepreneurial activity on achieving the SDGs varies across the behaviors and motivations of entrepreneurs, i.e. opportunity-driven and necessity driven entrepreneurs. In light of these findings, some important implications for policymakers are given as follow. Our findings support the significant role of entrepreneurship, particularly opportunity-based entrepreneurs on achieving the SDGs. Therefore, supporting innovative entrepreneurs or opportunity entrepreneurs is a possible solution to escape the challenge of sustainable development. An increase in the rates of necessity-driven entrepreneurs in the economy can lead to long-term negative impacts on sustainable development, as these entrepreneurs do not focus on the application of innovation in the production process and on increasing the performance of their businesses, but on obtaining the income necessary to live. Ben Youssef et al. (2018)  claimed, in this context, that successful sustainable innovation is realized if the entrepreneurial actors undertake a competitive advantage, that is, economic success via the creation of innovative environmental and the adoption of social practices. Accordingly, governments should support the innovative capacity of these entrepreneurs by improving their abilities and resources by offering more incentives and motivations for young entrepreneurs as protecting patents, finance support, and investing more in the development of training and education programs. These motivations encourage action in the opportunity entrepreneurship (Kirznerian entrepreneurship) and innovative entrepreneurship (Schumpeterian Entrepreneurship), which reduce the rate of necessity entrepreneurs and contribute to achieving the SDGs. Despite the contributions and implications discussed above, we note that our study suffers from two main limitations. First, it only examines the linkage between entrepreneurship and achieving the SDGs for the cased of developing countries. Future studies may extend this study by examining this subject for both developed and developing countries and demonstrating how this relationship depends not only on the behaviors and motivations of entrepreneurs but also on the stages of economic development. Second, it only examine the role of opportunity and necessity driven entrepreneurship to achieving the SDGs. Future studies could also consider other types of entrepreneurship, such as formal entrepreneurship, informal entrepreneurship, etc.  CRediT authorship contribution statement Sabrine Dhahri:  Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation.
