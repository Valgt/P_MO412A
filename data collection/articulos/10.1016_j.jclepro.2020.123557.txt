                  Solid waste collection (SWC) has been one of the growing challenges throughout the world due to the development of urbanization and uncontrolled growth of the population. It is a complex process that is expensive and requires the elaborate logistics management and in-depth mathematical computation. Hence, there is an urgent necessity to develop an efficient waste collection process while saving time, fuel, labour, maintenance costs, and carbon emissions. This goal of this is paper is to deliver a comprehensive review of the SWC system concerning solid waste collection objectives, constraints, the different optimization approaches, and models, along with their strengths and weakness. The different types of optimization objectives and constraints on SWC are highlighted towards improving solid waste collection and minimizing the cost. Furthermore, this review has classified the available optimization methods into different categories and technologies to provide a clear understanding for the readers. Besides, future research gaps are identified through the investigation of various key issues and challenges of the existing methods. Moreover, the significant contributions of SWC in connection to sustainable development goals (SDGs) are explained thoroughly. Finally, the review delivers some important proposals that would be beneficial to the researchers and policymakers to design an efficient and robust SWC system toward achieving SDGs.

TableÂ 6 Applications of GIS in achieving different objectives in SWC system.  TableÂ 6     Application target Refs. Methodology Outcomes   Landfill location identification Kamdar etÂ al. (2019)  Morphological, environmental and socio-economic parameters are taken into account. Supports the stakeholders in selecting suitable landfill sites that reduce negative environmental influences.  Gautam etÂ al. (2020)  The rank algorithm is proposed to assess landfill expansion. Assists the policymakers to discover appropriate sites for extensions.  Feyzi etÂ al. (2019)  The fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) is used to rank the interrelations among environmental, economic and socio-cultural criteria. Helps to find the proper place for installing solid waste power plant.  Khan etÂ al. (2018)  AHP is employed to evaluate different environmental and social factors. The appropriate sites to install 10 waste conversion facilities are identified through conducting the location-allocation analysis.  Waste collection points Vu etÂ al. (2018)  A total of 30 scenarios are considered to evaluate the interrelationships between the model parameters, concerning total operation costs and maintenance system costs. The temporary collection points greatly affect the cost-effectiveness in the collection phases.  Route optimization Nguyen-Trong etÂ al. (2017)  Multi-agent-based modeling and simulation are used. A reduction of 11.3% is reported in total distance traveled by each garbage truck.  Son (2014)  Chaotic PSO and ArcGIS are suggested to estimate the optimal solutions for the vehicle routing model. The proposed method shows better results than manual waste collection procedures.  Vu etÂ al. (2019)  ANN is combined with GIS to perform route optimization in SWC. Travel distance decreases up to a maximum of 16%.  Waste disposal management Ferronato etÂ al. (2020)  SWC selective collection (SC) scenarios are executed with QGIS3.8 software. Reduces the waste disposed to the landfill of about 543.6 tons per year and the expenses of about â¬59,000 per year.  Wu etÂ al. (2016)  A novel approach based on the spatial and temporal dimensions in the GIS system is proposed. The amount of waste to be disposed in landfills drops by 80% and increases the value of recycling by 65%.  Storage, collection, and transfer of waste Dehghani etÂ al. (2018)  AHP method is employed under the GIS environment. The site of reservoirs in residential and commercial districts is identified with a suggested coefficient of 0.75.

Prof. Jiri Jaromir KlemeÅ¡ Solid waste collection (SWC) has been one of the growing challenges throughout the world due to the development of urbanization and uncontrolled growth of the population. It is a complex process that is expensive and requires the elaborate logistics management and in-depth mathematical computation. Hence, there is an urgent necessity to develop an efficient waste collection process while saving time, fuel, labour, maintenance costs, and carbon emissions. This goal of this is paper is to deliver a comprehensive review of the SWC system concerning solid waste collection objectives, constraints, the different optimization approaches, and models, along with their strengths and weakness. The different types of optimization objectives and constraints on SWC are highlighted towards improving solid waste collection and minimizing the cost. Furthermore, this review has classified the available optimization methods into different categories and technologies to provide a clear understanding for the readers. Besides, future research gaps are identified through the investigation of various key issues and challenges of the existing methods. Moreover, the significant contributions of SWC in connection to sustainable development goals (SDGs) are explained thoroughly. Finally, the review delivers some important proposals that would be beneficial to the researchers and policymakers to design an efficient and robust SWC system toward achieving SDGs.   Keywords Solid waste collection  Optimization techniques  Optimization objectives  Optimization constraints  Sustainable development goals  Solid waste collection technologies    1 Introduction Urbanization is rapidly increasing in developing countries. The increasing trend towards urbanization and population growth combined with the growing concern about the negative environmental impacts have created a critical situation for the management of household solid waste (Chen, 2018 ). In line with that, ineffective waste management and weak policies may lead to the degradation of valuable land resources, a rise in the land price and the creation of long-term environmental and human health problems (Breukelman etÂ al., 2019 ). Hence, a sustainable solid waste collection (SWC) model is essential taking into consideration public health principles, legislative, social, economic and other environmental impacts (Ramos etÂ al., 2018 ). The SWC model includes many functional elements such as collection, sorting, separation, transfer and disposal to address aesthetic, health, economic, energy conservation and other environmental attentions (Hoque and Rahman, 2020 ). Among all the steps, the collection of waste is regarded as the most significant essentials toward achieving sustainable SWC. Nevertheless, SWC is a complex service that requires the consideration of different operational and logistical activities, equipment maintenance, preparation crews, health, safety, large expenditures and environmental issues, awareness of consumers and destination facilities for different types of waste (Das etÂ al., 2019 ). Therefore, the design of an intelligent SWC is increasingly explored to enhance waste collection efficiency. The research questions of this review can be written as follows;i. What are the objectives and parameters constraints required to design an optimized SWC toward reducing the cost, duration and emission?  ii. What are mathematical modeling approaches, intelligent systems and advanced technologies reported in the literature to achieve the objectives of SWC?  iii. What are the key issues that need to be taken into account while designing the SWC model?  iv. What are the impacts of SWC on sustainable development goals (SDGs)?    A great deal of research works has been published on finding the appropriate objectives in SWC. The most common optimization objectives include waste collection route optimization by reducing the route length (Sarmah etÂ al., 2019 ), time optimization (Carlos etÂ al., 2019 ), waste content (Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2018 ), cost optimization (Rathore and Sarmah, 2019 ) and environmental impacts (Ali etÂ al., 2018 ). To optimize these parameters in a more realistic environment, the various constraints have been considered. Since waste is collected by a waste collecting vehicle, the most common constraint in different studies is the vehicle capacity constraints (Dotoli and Epicoco, 2017 ), time constraints (BÃ¡nyai etÂ al., 2019 ), characteristic of collection component constraints (Yadav and Karmakar, 2019 ), environmental constraints (Pujara etÂ al., 2019 ), regulatory constraints (Roberts etÂ al., 2018 ), etc. Globally, the research on solid waste model development is advancing tremendously. A lot of SWC models have been reported in literature aiming to have a lower operating cost, labour hours, collection time, travel distances, and emissions (Pires etÂ al., 2019 ). Several methods are being applied to establish a SWC model such as mixed-integer linear programming based exact method, deterministic approach, stochastic approach, probabilistic approach, fuzzy approach, etc. Apart from that, numerous meta-heuristic approaches have been gaining popularity in waste collection optimization due to their simplicity, flexibility and robustness (Akhtar etÂ al., 2017 ). Recently, the development of the intelligent technologies, such as geographical information system (GIS), a global positioning system (GPS) and remote sensing (RS), radio-frequency identification (RFID), ZigBee, image processing and intelligent bins combined with different sensors, have been introduced and applied to develop an effective SWC system (Hannan etÂ al., 2015 ). The advanced technologies not only reduce the maintenance cost and travel distance but also save a significant amount of time and carbon emissions (Abdallah etÂ al., 2019 ). The investigation on various crucial issues related to SWC model needs to be taken into consideration. SWC operation can vary among countries due to various socio-economic factors including population size, financial status, road congestions, air pollution, human labour availability, amount of collection vehicle, etc. The waste collection process could also differ due to type building such as residential and commercial. Besides, the development of multi-objective functions and the feasibility of various technologies are considered as main barriers to execute the SWC model operations. The safety and waste disposal are reported as some other key issues of SWC. The implementation of an optimal SWC system can contribute to multiple SDGs and their targets related to improving the sustainable smart city/smart village through environmental protection, public health protection and poverty reduction. These targets can be achieved by efficient SWC through responsible consumption and production, execution of the renewable energy share in the global energy mix, prevention of marine pollution, mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in large quantities, reduction of chemical and biological hazardous wastes, development of sustainable cities, creation of employment opportunity toward economic growth and poverty reduction. The main contributions of this study are to deliver an in-depth discussion of SWC optimization objectives, constraints, methods and their challenges towards targeting SWC. Firstly, this review investigates the different waste collection objectives, constraints and their relation with sustainability. Then, the classification of optimization techniques is provided according to methods, technologies, benefits, and drawbacks. After, the challenges and issues of different optimization approaches are highlighted. Next, this work establishes the relationship of SWC with SDGs highlighting the influences of efficient collection process and technology towards future sustainability with regard to good health, clean water and sanitation, poverty reduction, sustainable cities, renewable energy production, responsible consumption, and production, economic growth, and emissions savings. Finally, this review delivers some effective suggestions for future system development. The remainder of the paper is organized into six sections. Sections 2  covers the review screening method. The SWC optimization and constraints are described under section 3 . The SWC methods, optimization techniques, technologies are explained in section 4 . The discussion, key issues and challenges of SWC are highlighted in section 5 . The connection between and SWC is established in section 6 . Section 7  concludes the review with some proposals.  2 Surveying methodology The survey process was carried out according to content analysis to fulfill the target of this review. The Scopus databases were used to explore the literature for this review. The Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus were chosen for the citation. The authors employed several keywords to search for relevant publications within the scope of the research including SWC, optimization methods, optimization objectives, optimization constraints; SWC modeling approaches,  and SDGs . Although numerous articles were found from the search, suitable literatures were selected by evaluating the title, keywords, abstract, paper content and the main topic of interest of the journal. Subsequently, the relevant articles were chosen based on the impact factor, review process and citation. The results of this screening method were organized into five groups. Firstly, the different SWC objectives, along with their constraints were comprehensively reviewed. Secondly, the SWC modeling approaches, advanced technologies, strengths, weaknesses and contributions were discussed. Thirdly, the review discussed various issues and challenges of different optimization approaches. Fourthly, the review analyzed the relationship of SWC with SDGs focusing on health, sanitation, poverty, economic progress, smart cities, renewable energy and emissions. Finally, the review delivers some suggestions for future improvement on SWC methods to achieve and contribute to SDGs. The review process can be divided into two phases as shown in Fig.Â 1   and summarized as follows: 2.1 Selection process â¢ A sum of 732 articles was chosen after the primary search.  â¢ The first assessment and screening were carried out using the appropriate keywords, title, abstract, article content, and journalâs main subject of interest and accordingly 397 articles were identified.  â¢ The second evaluation and screening were conducted using the articlesâ impact factor, review process, and citation.  â¢ Finally, a total of 162 articles published at journals and scientific conference proceedings were selected for the review at this stage.     2.2 Results of the review â¢ SWC optimization objectives and constraints and their influences on sustainability were broadly reviewed.  â¢ A comprehensive review of the SWC modeling approaches including optimization models, intelligent systems, pros, cons, and achievements was detailed.  â¢ The critical problems and challenges of SWC methods were discussed.  â¢ The relationship between SWC and SDGs were outlined.  â¢ Selective and important suggestions for further enhancement of SWC to minimize collection time, fuel, labour, maintenance costs and carbon emissions were provided.      3 Optimization objectives in SWC Researchers have employed many methods to optimize different parameters in their work. The most frequently used objectives in various papers are to find the route, allocation/reallocation of bins, minimization of the distance, costs and time. 3.1 Route optimization The most common optimization is route optimization which is performed to improve the collection and transportation of the SWC system. In most of the studies, the route of most cost-effective shortest distance is taken as the optimal route. In (Akhtar etÂ al., 2017 ), the route is optimized with a modified backtracking search algorithm (BSA) based capacitated vehicle-routing problem (CVRP) model. The proposed model aims to find the best route by taking into account the least fuel consumption, fuel cost and emissions. The results indicate that the reduction of CO2  emission is directly associated with the reduction of travel path and that is also related to fuel consumption and the main costs associated with the acquisition of fuels. The proposed research work reduces the travel distance by 36.80% which eventually minimizes the fuel consumption, fuel cost and CO2  emission by 50%, 47.77% and 44.68% in, respectively. The objective function is defined based on travel path minimization as written in the following equation,(1) M i n i m i z e  f ( x )  = â i = 0  n  â j = 0  n  â V = 1  k  d i j   X i j k          where i Â = {1, 2, â¦,n}  is the set of the homogeneous bin; n  is the total bin; V  is the set of the homogeneous vehicle; d ij   is the nonnegative distance cost and X ijk   is the vehicle travel distance from bin i  to bin j.  In (Das and Bhattacharyya, 2015 ), an optimal waste collection scheme is proposed to search for an optimal route from the waste sources to waste collection centers, the transfer station and the processing plant. The result shows a 30% reduction in waste collection travel length. In (Malakahmad etÂ al., 2014 ), GIS based vehicle routing in SWC is proposed to optimize the route distance and travel duration. The results illustrated the reduction of waste collective time from 6934s to 4602Â s. In (Sulemana etÂ al., 2018 ), the various optimal routing methods of SWC are surveyed concerning mathematical programming, GIS, hybrid optimization along with their strength and weakness.  3.2 Time optimization Time is a very important parameter that needs to be considered. It can be optimized by reducing the number of turns in the route, based on population density, etc. (Rai etÂ al., 2019 ). In (Son and Louati, 2016 ), a generalized vehicle routing model for SWC is established to decrease the total travel span and working hours considering one-way traveling routes, waiting time at traffic stops and the number of vehicles. The vehicle assignments and schedules are taken into account in (Ramdhani etÂ al., 2018 ) to decrease the number of vehicles required to serve all routes. The assignment of each garbage truck is also considered in (BÃ¡nyai etÂ al., 2019 ) to optimize the waste collection routing, leading to an increase in the reliability and decrease the operational cost. The objective function is derived to reduce the energy use during waste collection process as expressed in the following equation,(2) min f ( x )  = â k = 1  q  â Î± = 1  h  â Î² = 1  n Î±    â Î³ = 1  n Î²    â i = 1  m  Î½ k , Î±   ( q k , Î± , Î² , Î³    )       . l k , Î± , Î²   ( B k , Î± , Î²    )  . x k , Î± , Î² , Î³ , i       where, Î½ k , Î±      is energy usage of waste loading truck Î±   from depot k   between households; q k , Î± , Î² , Î³      is the waste loading truck that covers Î³ t h      allocated households; l k , Î± , Î²      is route length Î²   of waste loading truck Î±   from depot k   between households; B k , Î± , Î²      is the set of allocated households to route length Î²   of waste loading truck Î±   from depot k   and x k , Î± , Î² , Î³ , i      is the households assignment matrix to the collection paths.  3.3 Allocation/reallocation of bins The efficiency of the waste collection and transportation can be improved by the reallocation of bins. In (Khan and Samadder, 2016 ), the location of waste bins, waste collection timetables, along with population density, and the road network are studied to develop an effective solid waste bin allocation approach for the city Dhanbad, India demonstrating significant outcomes in cost reductions. The authors in (Rathore etÂ al., 2020 ) did bin distributions for SWC by taking the real scenario of Bilaspur city, India. A suitable SWC model is formulated considering the type of waste and waste bin. The proposed model proves the effectiveness in reducing cost (25%), collection points (15%), and CO2  emissions (35%). The objective function is established to minimize the waste bin purchase cost and waste bin unloading waiting cost as expressed in the following equation,(3) Minimize  f ( x )  = â i = 0  n  â j = 0  m  â k = 1  K  ( C j  + C w j    )  Ã x i j k          Where i  is the site number; j  is the type of bin; k  is the type of waste; C j   is the cost of purchasing of type j  bin; C wj   is the cost of waiting for unloading bin type j  at the collection point and x ijk   is the number of bins of type j  for waste type k.   3.4 Waste bin optimization Waste content collection is optimized by using real-time monitoring of waste bin. In (Abdallah etÂ al., 2019 ), a smart waste bin collection system is proposed to select the appropriate bin utilizing the variable bin filling rates. The system is validated by a field survey and actual waste generation data is obtained from the different types of households in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The proposed method outperforms the conventional system in terms of reducing the operation cost and carbon emissions amounting to 19% and 22%, respectively. A work by (Hemmelmayr etÂ al., 2014 ) designed an integrated solid waste management (SWM) model to address bin configuration, bin sizing and vehicle routing problems. The objective function is formulated to reduce the purchase cost as shown in the following equation,(4) M i n i m i z e Â  f ( x )  = â i = 1  n  â j = 1  m  C j P  x i j         where C j P     is the buying price of a type j  bin and x i j      is an integer variable that provides the number of bin type j = 1 , ... , m    to be located at the waste transfer place. i = 1 , ... , n     3.5 Cost optimization Research on cost minimization has been a concern from the very beginning. Cost optimization can be performed by reducing cost in fuel consumption, the labour cost, and the number of vehicles, etc. By decreasing the number of trips or by reducing the length of the route, fuel consumption can be decreased. In (Mantzaras and Voudrias, 2017 ), an objective function is formulated based on genetic algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation to minimize the operational cost including waste collection, transfer, and disposal. In (Greco etÂ al., 2015 ), the authors did an investigation on the collection cost of various types of wastes and found that population size, collection type and delivery have substantial impacts on cost drivers. A work in (DâOnza etÂ al., 2016 ) introduced full cost accounting (FCA) method to evaluate the waste collection efficiency and costs of separate and undifferentiated waste. In (Asefi and Lim, 2017 ), the authors developed an objective function to minimize the cost associated with establishing waste transfer station, waste treatment technology, recycling technology, along with non-hazardous and hazardous disposal unit as expressed in the following equation,(5) Minimize  f ( x )  = â i â K   C i K  a i K  + â i â M   â t â T   C t , i  M  a t , i  M    +  â i â H   â r â R   C r , i  H  a r , i  H    + â i â L   C i L  a i L   + â i â L â   C i L â   a i L   â       where C i K     is establishment cost of the waste transfer station unit at node i â K   , a i K     is the waste transfer station unit at node i â K   , C t , i  M     is the fixed cost of opening a treatment technology unit t â T    opened at node i â M   , a t , i  M     is 1 if the treatment technology unit t â T    opened at node i â M    ; otherwise 0, C r , i  H     is the fixed cost of installing a recycling technology r â R    at node i â H   , a r , i  H     is 1 if the recycling technology unit r â R    opened at node i â H   ; otherwise 0, C i L     and C i L â      represent the fixed cost of installing a non-hazardous and hazardous disposal unit opened at node i â L    and i â L â   , respectively, a i L     and a i L   â     denote 1 if non-hazardous and hazardous disposal unit opened at node i â L    and i â L â   , respectively; otherwise 0. In (Nguyen-Trong etÂ al., 2017 ), an agent-based model is built to optimize the SWC and transportation. The study is conducted by introducing a fitness function based on the cost of finding a better route map, which shows a 11.3% cost saving when applied to real-life data. In (Jatinkumar Shah etÂ al., 2018 ), an internet of Technology (IoT) based waste management for smart cities is proposed to optimize the waste collection operation planning and reduce operational costs. The optimized model focuses on minimizing the cost incurred in transportation while maintaining the embedded value in waste bins recovery. A work by (Tirkolaee etÂ al., 2020 ) designed a novel and robust mathematical model for SWC emphasizing the total cost optimization with respect to the collection, operation, transportation, and penalty cost. In (Saeidi-Mobarakeh etÂ al., 2020 ), a robust bi-level optimization model based on MILP is studied to develop a hazardous waste management framework addressing the demand side uncertainties. The mathematical formulation to reduce the operational cost in waste management as expressed as follows:(6) min f = t c â s â S   â k â K   â i â ( O âª G âª F âª F â²   )    â j â ( O âª G âª F âª F â²   )    Ï s  . d i j   . Y i j k s       + Ï â s â S   â k â K   â i â ( O âª G âª F âª F â²   )    â j â ( O âª G âª F âª F â²   )    Ï s  . n i j  â²  . Y i j k s            The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (7)  implies the cost of the waste collection while the second term denotes the transportation cost for traffic routes. S  is demand forecast scenario, K  is collection vehicle, O  is the number of depots, G  is waste resources, F  and F â²     denote the available and potential facility, respectively, tc  represents the transportation cost estimated in per unit of distance for carrying one unit of waste ($/km), Ï s     is probability scenario, d i j      is the distance in km between node i  and j , Y i j k s      is 1 if the vehicle k  travels node j  immediately after node i ; 0 otherwise, Ï   is coefficient related to toll-setting, n i j  â²     denotes risk factor due to transportation on link i-j.   3.6 Transfer/collection station Usually, the vehicles collect waste from pick up points and transport to the intermediate facilities or collection station. If the amount of waste rises and the length of travel to waste facilities increases, then the transportation budget becomes progressively expensive. Therefore, the transfer of waste to the collection station is usually taken into account for minimizing the cost. In (Habibi etÂ al., 2017 ), a robust multi-objective function for SWM is proposed to minimize cost and emissions by optimally finding the location, recycling plants, landfills, appropriate technology, and waste transport vehicles considering three dimensions of sustainability; social, economic and environment. The authors in (Pouriani etÂ al., 2019 ) proposed a robust optimization approach that involves waste bin establishment cost and waste allocation to the various centers. The results demonstrate that the optimal waste collection station leads to a reduction in costs as well as the optimum flow of the wastes. The objective function is formulated using the separation cost, packaging cost, transportation cost, waste conversion cost, recycling factory holding cost and fuel consumption coefficient cost as written as follows,(7) M i n i m i z e  f ( x )  = â l  â j  â t  c l  p i j t   +    â l  â p  â j  â t  c l p  t r a n s , i n   p l p j t  i n        + â j  â p  â t  Î± j p   p j p t  p r o c e s s   +    â j  â p  â m  â t  c p m  t r a n s , o u t   p j p m t  o u t        + â p  â t  l p t   c p t  h o l d   + â l  â i  p o p i  D i l   x i l    g          where c l     is the separation and packaging cost in region l , p i j t      is the quantity of waste j  collected at station l  in duration t , c l p  t r a n s , i n      and c p m  t r a n s , o u t      denote the cost of waste transportation from region l  to recycling factory p  and from the recycling factory p  to customer m,  respectively, p l p j t  i n      and p j p m t  o u t      are the quantity of waste j  transferred from collection station l  to recycling factory p  and from recycling factory p  to customer m  in duration t , respectively, Î± j p      is the costs of waste conversion coefficient to product j  at recycling factory p , p j p t  p r o c e s s      is the quantity of processed product j  at recycling factory p  in duration t , l p t      is the amount of inventory at the factory p  interval t , c p t  h o l d      is the holding cost in recycling factory p  in interval t , p o p i     is the population of region i , D i l      is the length between regions i  and collection station l, x i l     is  1 if region i  is assigned to the collection station of region l,  otherwise 0  and g   is the fuel consumption coefficient cost.  3.7 Environmental impact The SWC needs to be optimized considering the environmental impact as well. The least polluting waste collection procedure must be obtained for collection. The main impact on the environment is due to the emission of GHGs from collection vehicles. In (Levis etÂ al., 2013 ), a SWC life-cycle framework is suggested for the collection and treatment of waste by exploring cost and GHG emissions. In (Pourreza Movahed etÂ al., 2020 ), a life cycle assessment (LCA) based SWC is proposed to achieve minimal production of CO2  and energy consumption. The new technology is validated using economic data of Tehran delivering significant savings in daily CO2  production of 2710Â t and energy consumption of 2604Â GJ. The authors in (Fortuna and Diyamandoglu, 2017 ) developed the SWC framework with a focus to minimize GHG emissions from transportation exploring emission factors, distanced traveled, waste mass entering the system, and transfer coefficients. The authors in (Kurdve etÂ al., 2015 ) proposed an integrated waste flow mapping (WFM) method based on the integration of environmental and operational management to reduce the waste material losses and handling inefficiencies. In (Heidari etÂ al., 2019 ), a new mathematical programming model is designed by taking into account the uncertain environment distinguishes, employment opportunities, and waste separating units. The multi-objective function is formulated considering cost, GHG emission and social aspect of sustainability. The objective function is defined to minimize the GHG emissions considering waste type, waste quantity, traveled distance and waste technology as shown in the following equation,(8) Minimize  f ( x )  = â l â L   â q â Q   â f â F 1    â i â ( E âª F 1  âª F 2   )    â t â T   â w â W   e c w q   . c o m w t   .

However, it is not that easy to find an appropriate range of constraints in the optimization collection process. There are always numerous issues and challenges in every region. The SWC model becomes more practical by taking into account more constraints. The most common constraints in the SWC are discussed below. 4.1 Capacity constraint Under capacity constraint, the vehicle capacity in terms of total weight or volume of waste it can carry during the trip is the main concern (Sarmah etÂ al., 2019 ). Sometimes the capacity or volume of the containers at the pick-up point or capacity of the transfer station is also considered (Erfani etÂ al., 2018 ). In (Cheng etÂ al., 2018 ), capacity constraints of the landfill, type of vehicle and total number of vehicles employed for waste collection are examined to maximize the reliability of SWC system, as shown in equations (9)â(11) , respectively.(9) â i â V   v i  Î¼ r i    Î¼ c i     â¤ L c a p a c i t y       (10) v i  â¤ v i  M a x , Â  â i â V     (11) â i â V   v i  â¤ N      where, v i     is the total number vehicle; i â V    is vehicle type; Î¼ r i       and Î¼ c i       denote the reliability index parameters; L c a p a c i t y      is the capacitary of landfill and N  is the maximum number of vehicles.  4.2 Demand constraint The main target of SWC is to meet the demands of the customers. All efforts to optimize collection will be in vain if this demand is not fulfilled. The waste management company has to service all its customers by collecting all the garbage bags from the street. There has to be a proper supply of vehicles and labours to satisfy the customersâ demand. In (Maryam Mohammadi etÂ al., 2019 ), the authors considered that the demand for each product must be accomplished during each interval without allowing any delay in fulfillment. In (Tirkolaee etÂ al., 2020 ), a mathematical model is developed to minimize the total cost of the SWC system ensuing that the demand node is assigned by the corresponding waste collection facility when it has been already built in the region. The following equation is used to represents the demand constraint,(12) x i k j t   â¤ â f = 1  2  y f k j t     ( i = 1,2 , ... , I ; k = 1,2 , ... , K ;    j = 1,2 , ... , J ; t = 1,2 , ... , T     )       where x i k j t      is 1 if demand node i  is covered by the waste collection facility in node k  of region j  in duration t ; otherwise 0. y f k j t      is 1 if waste collection facility is built in node k  of region j  in duration t ; otherwise 0.  4.3 Mass balance constraint While designing a SWC model, a balanced mass flow of waste in the entire SWC system needs to be maintained. Asefi and Lim (2017)  considered the mass flow stability in the entire SWC system, thus confirming balanced waste in the processing site. SantibaÃ±ez-Aguilar etÂ al. (2013)  considered the equal amount of waste transferred from one city to another city. Yadav etÂ al. (2017)  developed a SWM model with mass balance constraints denoting that the amount of solid waste entering and leaving the transfer stations and composting plants should be equal as presented in the following equation,(13) â i = 1  N  [ X i j  L  , X i j  U   ]   = â k = 1  P  [ X j k  L  , X j k  U   ]   â â l = 1  Q  [ X j l  L  , X j l  U   ]       where [ X j l  L  , X j l  U   ]     is the amount of waste (in tonne) transferred from point i  to the transfer point j  daily; k  and l  denote the composite plant and landfill, respectively.  4.4 Time constraint There are different constraints regarding time such as time window, load and unload time and the drivers break time. In most case studies, the time window for collection nodes and facilities is considered (Mukherjee Basu and Punjabi, 2019 ). In (Yadav and Karmakar, 2019 ), the time window is defined as the vehicleâs needs for the collection and transportation of solid waste to minimize the traveling cost. In (Son and Louati, 2016 ), the time window is set by considering the vehicle travel route, the number of vehicles, as well as waiting time at traffic, stops to make the collection tour efficient in terms of time, fuel, etc. Time constraint is also considered in terms of the unloading time of each bin, or the total duration of a vehicle cannot exceed a preset value (Faccio etÂ al., 2011 ). In (Dotoli and Epicoco, 2017 ), the authors considered the driversâ lunch break time, maximum working hours, time of loading, discharging the waste and duration required to separate the different types of hazardous waste. The following equation denotes the time constraint including the time window of the disposal site and total discharging time.(14) w n + 2,1   + ( â i â V c    â j â V / V d    t d i , h   . x u , i , j , l      )  â¤ b n + 2 , v      â v â { 1 , ... , T i   }  , â u â U , â l â L , â h â H        where; U = { u â U  }     is the vehicle fleet; L = { l â L  }     is the set of all possible routes to be traveled based on the clientsâ requests; H = { h â H  }     is the type of waste; V = { 1 , ... , n + 3  }     is the set of all nodes which is divided into three groups; V d    , V f    , and V c    , representing the depot, disposal site and number of clients, respectively; t d i , h      is the discharge time; the binary variables x u , i , j , l      is equal to 1 if the travel route l â L    from node i  to j  is traveled by the vehicle and b n + 2 , v      is time window range.  4.5 Waste type constraint The variation of different types of waste resources is another concern to design a SWC model. A work in (Son, 2014 ) considered three different waste collection vehicles considering the real scenario where these vehicles to transport waste between different waste facilities. Some studies consider a heterogeneous vehicle fleet for collecting a different type of waste (Asefi etÂ al., 2019a ). In (Hemmelmayr etÂ al., 2013 ), a heterogeneous vehicle fleet is considered where each type collects a specific type of waste. In (Vonolfen etÂ al., 2011 ), the homogeneous fleet of vehicles is assigned with different sections to avoiding the mixing of different waste glass types. In (Rabbani etÂ al., 2018 ), the different types of wastes are considered with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles to optimize the traveled distance and reduce the transport cost. Equations (15) and (16)  state that collected non-recyclable waste types and recyclable waste types by the loading truck must be delivered to a treatment center and a recycling facility, respectively.(15) â i â G   x i j k   â â i â â D   x j i â k   = 0    â j â R âª   T , k â K     (16) x i j k   â¤ â w â W   â q â Q   v w k   Â  c o m w q   Â  t q j Â      â i â G , j â T , k â K     where G = { 1 , ... , g  }    , D = { 1 , ... , d  }    , T = { 1 , ... , t  }    , Q = { 1 , ... , q  }    , K = { 1 , ... , k  }    , T = { 1 , ... , t  }     and R = { 1 , ... , r  }     denote source nodes, depots, waste type, treatment technology, fleet of vehicle, waste treatment nodes and recycling nodes respectively; x i j k      is 1 if node j  is traveled just after node i  by vehicle k â K   ; otherwise 0; c o m w q      is 1 if waste type w â W    is well-suited with waste treatment technology q â Q   ; otherwise 0; t q j      is 1 if a waste treatment facility with technology q â Q    is established at node i â ( T â T â  )    ; otherwise 0.  4.6 Labour constraint Under the labour constraint, the working hours of crews or the number of fleets required are considered in different studies. Each employee has to work for a specific duration or in a specific shift. In (Yusuf etÂ al., 2019 ), the authors assigned the labour working hours to operate the garbage loading truck from Monday to Saturday between 7 a.m. and 12 p.m. In (Owusu-Nimo etÂ al., 2019 ), the authors studied the average waiting time and loading time of five different trucks to deliver waste to the landfill site. In certain cases, the number of required workforces can be assigned considering the extra cost. In (Heidari etÂ al., 2019 ), the optimization of cost, GHG emission and social sustainability with regard to employment possibilities are subject to the amount of human labour required in separating unit and processing facilities of a SWC system. Moreover, the number of required trips can also be assessed while developing a SWC system. For instance, In (Mohsenizadeh etÂ al., 2020 ) a SWC system with the objectives of cost reduction and emission control is achieved considering the labour constraint. The number of trips by waste vehicles is estimated using the shortest paths from waste sources to transfer stations, transfer stations to processing and treatment (P & T) facilities, and P&T facilities to sanitary landfills, respectively, as shown in equations (17)â(19) , respectively,(17) N M T i j   â¥ Q M T i j    c a p 1    , Â  â i â I,Â  â j â J     (18) N M P j k   â¥ Q T P j k    c a p 2    , Â  â j â J ,Â  â k â K     (19) N P L k l   â¥ Q P L k l    c a p 3    , Â  â k â K ,Â  â l â L     where N M T i j     , N M P j k      and N P L k l      are the number of trips by waste vehicle daily from node i  to node j , node j  to node k , and node k  to node l,  respectively; Q M T i j     , Q T P j k      and Q P L k l      are the amount of waste (tonne/day) to be transferred from node i  to node j , node j  to node k , and node k  to node l,  respectively; c a p t     is the capacity of vehicle.  4.7 Environment constraint Environmental constraints are chosen to reduce the negative environmental impacts considering the life cycle of SWC system. Moreover, these constraints ensure that the quality criteria standards are satisfied during the composition of the waste material in the recovery stage (Vonolfen etÂ al., 2011 ) (Hrabec etÂ al., 2018 ). In (Edalatpour etÂ al., 2018 ), the restrictions on the carbon footprint and GHG emission are incorporated to optimize the operational performance of waste management. In (M. Mohammadi etÂ al., 2019 ), the permissible limit of CO2  emission constraint is assigned in such as way so that the distance traveled by the number of vehicles for the transfer of waste from depot to center stations does not increase fuel consumption, as depicted in the following equation,(20) â v  F v  . E C O 2    . ( â m  D m s   . y m s v t   + â l  D s l   . y s l v t   + â p  D s p   . y s p v t       )   â¤ A E s t  C O 2    Â  â s â S, t â T     where, F v     is the amount of fuel consumed (litre/kilometer) by vehicle type v ; E C O 2       is the amount of CO2  emission released from each litre of fuel; D m s     , D s l      and D s p      are the distances from municipality m  to separation centre s ; from s  to landfill l ; from s  to plant p , respectively; y m s v t     , y s l v t      and y s p v t      are the number of vehicle employed to carry the waste from m  to s , from s  to l , from s  to p  in interval t , respectively, A E s t  C O 2       is the acceptable level of CO2  emission from vehicles in interval t , s â { 1,2 , ... , S  }     is the waste separation center, and t â { 1,2 , ... , T  }     is the time duration.  4.8 Regulatory constraint Some regulatory constraints must be figured out while formulating the optimization objectives in SWC system. For example, throwing garbage is allowed only in a certain time or a bin must be emptied after a certain level, etc. Other regulatory constraints can be starting and ending the tour of the vehicle in the depot, visit each stop exactly once, visiting each stop by only one truck, bin has to be emptied fully, each trip is assigned to exactly one predecessor and one successor, no stop is permitted when a vehicle is full, it must go to a disposal facility, etc. Moreover, during the optimization of solid waste collection, a very important issue is the restriction and regulations of the road. Turn is a common constraint that is considered in researches. A work in (Liu and He, 2012a ) considered the one-way road and forbidden turn as the optimization constraints. In (Fan etÂ al., 2010 ), a SWC mathematical model is proposed for optimal vehicle distance and scheduling satisfying conditions such as the traveling of the waste truck to all containers, full volume waste containers and high heating value waste containers. In (Katkar, 2012 ), an improved SWC model is designed considering population density, road network, waste bin positions along with vehicle capacity, waste collection schedules. In (Liu etÂ al., 2010 ), multi-depot vehicle routing problem is taken into consideration which permits the waste vehicle to start at one depot but finish at another depot. In (Liu and He, 2012b ), An optimized SWC model is introduced considering inter-depot vehicle routes while satisfying constraints including vehicle start and end point, duration, capacity, and time. In (Vonolfen etÂ al., 2011 ), an efficient SWC model is built with two dispatching rules including capacity utilization and priority threshold.  4.9 Political constraint Constraints categorized as political are diverse. In simulations, political constraints are not usually considered. They have been considered mainly in real case study research. It may include the lobbying aspect in the selection of an assigned company responsible for the task. Sometimes, the special preference is given to different governmental parties for choosing one particular company, despite that the other companies may be more eligible than the assigned one. Sometimes the optimization has to be performed considering the preset regulations set by an authority. Political constraints are taken into consideration in a few studies (Marshall and Farahbakhsh, 2013 ; Plata-DÃ­az etÂ al., 2014 ; Wee etÂ al., 2017 ; Yukalang etÂ al., 2017 ).  4.10 Social and non-negativity constraint Social constraints confirm that the proposed method takes into account the involvement of various stakeholder groups in the decision-making process. Nonetheless, the participation of stakeholders is usually determined based on qualitative standard and subjective values (Noche etÂ al., 2010 ). On the other hand, the non-negativity constraint is normally considered for decision variables. It assures that the decision variables are equal to or greater than zero. The authors in (Jones etÂ al., 2010 ) explored the impacts of four social capital parameters including social networks, social trust, institutional trust, and compliance with social norms to increase recycling and minimize the waste volume. The study demonstrates that social factors influence the personsâ perceptions and environmental attitude significantly during the execution of policy tool. In (Kamaruddin etÂ al., 2013 ), the social learning in sustainable waste management is investigated using the qualitative data collected from two case studies. The study identifies several constraints in enabling social learning toward waste management. The authors in (Ma and Hipel, 2016 ) conducted a comprehensive literature review on SWM based on social dimensions around the world. The results illustrate that the social dimensions of waste management are insufficient and inequitable which require further attention and exploration. A study by (Rebehy etÂ al., 2017 ) introduced an innovative social business model of waste collection to evaluate the economic-financial feasibility using the information technology and logistics approach. The proposed model confirms the financial viability and provides benefits with respect to social, and environment. A summary of different studies under different optimization objectives and constraints is depicted in TableÂ 1  .   5 Modeling and solution approaches of SWC This section delivers a detailed survey of SWC modeling and solution approaches. The progress of deterministic, stochastic, fuzzy, probabilistic, conventional and heuristic methods is highlighted to explain the SWC operation. 5.1 Modeling approaches of SWC The modeling approaches of SWC is used in common to minimize the waste collection distance, cost, time, or any other objectives, but these techniques suffer from poor computational efforts and work better in more simple situations. 5.1.1 Deterministic and stochastic approaches In the study of solid waste optimization, an important concern is whether the model is deterministic or stochastic (Asefi etÂ al., 2019b ). A large part of the literature on SWC has been reported using the deterministic formulations, where all problem variables are known at the initial point of model development. However, this assumption may not hold true in real-world cases. Uncertainty can influence parameters such as the amount of waste generated, transportation costs, waste processing and waste transformation coefficients. The way forward could be to apply the stochastic models that can be designed with the assumptions of the probability distributions using random data elements or the past data. The authors in (Chen etÂ al., 2016 ) considered multiple sources of uncertainties for waste management planning in the city of Xiamen, China which integrates inventory model, inexact chance-constrained programming, mixed-integer linear programming and interval-valued fuzzy programming. In (Gambella etÂ al., 2019 ), A two-stage multi-period stochastic programming is introduced with realistic constraints for waste flow allocation aiming to reduce the total management costs. A work in (Chen etÂ al., 2017 ) developed an approach based on stochastic fractional inventory-theory for SWC integrating inventory model, stochastic linear fractional programming and mixed-integer linear programming under several constraint-violation risks. In (Di Corato and Montinari, 2014 ), stochastic dynamic programming is applied to design optimal SWC programs under the uncertainty of recyclables cost. Another work in (Sun etÂ al., 2013 ) considered uncertainties such as waste generation rates and waste parameters to develop a joint chance-constrained programming model.  5.1.2 Fuzzy and probabilistic approaches Many researchers have examined various uncertainties to develop an efficient and realistic SWC model. The probabilistic approach, robust approach, fuzzy approach are some methods that can model a SWC system with uncertainties, as presented in TableÂ 2  . Xu etÂ al. (2016)  suggested an enhanced fuzzy robust optimization model which can tackle fuzzy constraints with multiple algorithms and can integrate fuzzy violation variables under complex uncertainties. Bui etÂ al. (2020)  applied the fuzzy Delphi method to identify the major barriers of waste management practice including technical, economical, human resource and information sharing. Jahanfar etÂ al. (2017)  introduced a novel probabilistic approach under uncertainties including the density, friction angle and cohesion of solid waste slopes. Xu etÂ al. (2014)  developed an interval joint-probabilistic mixed-integer programming (IJMP) method by assigning joint probabilistic constraints such as random variables, interval values uncertainties and violation levels in waste management practice constraints.   5.2 Solution approaches of SWC This section discusses the different solution approaches of SWC including conventional, heuristic and meta-heuristic methods. 5.2.1 Conventional approaches The conventional approaches cannot deliver satisfactory solutions while optimizing multiple objectives and handling uncertain parameters. However, the conventional approaches can transform multiple objectives into a weighted sum single objective which is less complex to solve. The research is advancing to enhance the mathematical programming which can accept uncertain input parameters and cope with many real-world problems. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approaches are receiving attention for modeling a problem with variables changing within real numbers or the integers. However, MILP has shortcomings in terms of large computational efforts and risk of high-dimensionality. In (Yousefloo and Babazadeh, 2020 ), the MILP model is designed for SWC to optimize the total costs taking into account the economic and environmental aspects. In (Mavrotas etÂ al., 2015 ), the authors applied the MILP model and the generation of Pareto optimal solutions to optimize the net present value (NPV) and the total GHG emissions for SWC in the Athens region in Greece. In (ErdinÃ§ etÂ al., 2019 ), MILP based optimal SWC is established to identify the best route for waste collection in Istanbul, Turkey. The mathematical model is formulated to minimize the total energy consumption, as shown in the following equation,(21) min T E C = â h  â i  â j  E C i , j   . x i , j , h ,   â â  j        where TEC  is total energy consumption, EC  is the energy consumption between waste bins i  and j  in kWh, X i,j,h   is the electric garbage truck h  traveling between waste bins i  and j.  The concept of the proposed model has led to a reduction of 32% in energy consumption using the optimal direction during the waste collection process.  5.2.2 Heuristic approaches The heuristic approaches are dominant to conventional approaches in terms of computational time and problem complexity. The cluster-first-route-second heuristic method was used to solve the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) by the Vertex-one Centre algorithm (Otoo etÂ al., 2014 ). In this method, at first, the groups are formed by clustering the customers and then allocated to waste vehicles (phase I); after which, efficient routes are identified for each group (phase II). The authors in (Hemmelmayr etÂ al., 2013 ) applied the heuristic of the Clarke and Wright algorithm only to initialize the vehicle-routing problem (VRP). The results demonstrate that the routing cost drops by 25% compared to the current solution. In (CÃ¡rdenas-BarrÃ³n etÂ al., 2019 ), a heuristic method is introduced based on reducing and optimize approach (ROA) to address routing problems.  5.2.3 Meta-heuristic approaches Nowadays, meta-heuristic approaches have become the most popular in waste collection optimization. The meta-heuristic approaches can provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem with limited computational capacity or incomplete information. Generally, the meta-heuristic methods are developed using the concepts of physical sciences or biological evolution. The meta-heuristic approaches are classified as follows: (1) population-based approaches, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA); and (2) trajectory-based approaches, such as the tabu search (TS) and simulated annealing (SA). The PSO algorithm is a popular meta-heuristic population-based optimization approach which uses the behaviors and movement of an organism such as bird flocking and fish schooling in searching for food. PSO has an easy implementation process and requires a few tuning parameters. Besides, PSO exhibits efficient memory capacity and low computational cost (Akhtar etÂ al., 2016 ). A work in (Duman etÂ al., 2019 ) applied PSO to develop a novel forecasting method focusing on the prediction of e-waste generation. The results illustrate that household income level and population density have a significant impact on the generation of e-waste. In (Hannan etÂ al., 2018 ), a CVRP model is designed based on a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves the best waste collection and route optimization with regard to fuel consumption, travel length, cost and efficiency. The ACO is based on the behavior of an ant in a path that is designed using the deposition of pheromones by the previous ants. ACO is more advantageous than other methods in terms of convergence speed (Zhang and Xiong, 2018 ). In (Liu and He, 2012a ), a clustering-based improved multiple ACO is proposed to minimize the route distance of waste collection. The results indicate a decrease in route length by 31.1% and 31.9% with or without turns constraints, respectively. In (Nambiarl and Idicula, 2013 ), the static vehicle routing problem (SVRP) is transformed into a dynamic vehicle routing problem in SWC and accordingly, a modified ACO-based approach is applied to find the optimal routes to visit the waste collection facilitates. In (Ismail and Loh, 2009 ), ACO is employed to address waste collection problems aiming to reduce the traveling cost with the implementation of preventive restocking policy. In (Mancera-GalvÃ¡n etÂ al., 2017 ), two ACO algorithms are suggested for waste collection optimization and the results show improvements with regard to route length minimization and routes re-design. The ABC is formulated using a natural foraging act of honey bees. The ABC is superior to other optimization methods concerning flexibility, easiness and robustness (Lin etÂ al., 2018 ). In (Wei etÂ al., 2019 ), the ABC optimization algorithm is employed to minimize the carbon emission cost of all vehicles during waste collection. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by experiments that demonstrate superior performance than other popular swarm-based optimization algorithms. The results indicate a reduction of 7.16% in carbon emissions by choosing an optimal waste disposal trip. The GA uses three operational stages including, reproduction, crossover, and mutation to upgrade the fitness function and accordingly achieve the final best solution. The GA has simple execution progression but has some weaknesses with respect to slow optimization response time (Dutta etÂ al., 2020 ). GA has been widely used for waste optimization (Komly etÂ al., 2012 ). In (Assaf and Saleh, 2017 ), a VRP for SWC is modeled through GA to find the optimal routes leading to the minimization of the traveled path and operational costs. The results indicate a reduction in travel distance by 66% while waste collected duration is limited to 2.3Â h. The SA is a famous heuristic optimization technique, which is inspired by metallurgy annealing. In (Muttiah etÂ al., 1996 ), The Markov-chain-based SA algorithm is suggested to search for optimal waste disposal location using GIS. In (Song etÂ al., 2014 ), a forecast model based on SA is introduced to assess the multistep ahead prediction ability of waste generation in Washington, the United States. In (Babaee Tirkolaee etÂ al., 2019 ), SA is proposed to address the VRP to minimize the total cost within permitted time windows. SA is also employed in (Asefi etÂ al., 2017 ) to develop an integrated SWC network to address location-routing problem leading to a reduction in establishment cost and transportation cost. The TS is another meta-heuristic algorithm that enhances the performance of the local search (neighborhood search) by relaxing its basic rules. In (Shao etÂ al., 2020 ), a waste collection synchronization mechanism is proposed using TS to find efficient vehicle routes and achieve maximum profitability. In (GÃ³mez etÂ al., 2015 ), TS is employed to collect the waste bins in rural areas using multi-objective adaptive memory programming (MOAMP). TableÂ 3   compares the most commonly used meta-heuristic optimization approaches in SWC to achieve various objectives. The comparative analysis of different solution approaches of SWC is presented in TableÂ 4  . Each modeling and solution approach of SWC has its advantages and disadvantages, as depicted in TableÂ 5  .   5.3 Use of GIS GIS has been used extensively in SWC in recent years. The ArcGIS is a valuable and powerful tool for waste collection and optimization (Singh, 2019 ). In (Kamdar etÂ al., 2019 ), GIS is integrated with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine the appropriate landfill locations in Songkhla, Thailand. Likewise, the GIS approach is adopted to locate the possible landfill sites in Coimbatore, South India (Gautam etÂ al., 2020 ), north of Iran (Feyzi etÂ al., 2019 ), Nigeria (Ajibade etÂ al., 2019 ) and Saskatchewan, Canada (Richter etÂ al., 2019 ). In (Khan etÂ al., 2018 ), The GIS is incorporated with AHP to estimate the amount of solid waste as well as determine the suitable locations by conducting the location-allocation analysis. In (Vu etÂ al., 2018 ), GIS is utilized to optimize the waste collection resulting in the minimization of garbage truck travel distance. In (Nguyen-Trong etÂ al., 2017 ), an agent-based model is designed to optimize solid waste transportation through GIS analysis in Hagiang City, Vietnam. The results demonstrate a reduction of 11.3% in total distance traveled by each garbage truck. In (Malakahmad etÂ al., 2014 ), the GIS technique is employed to find the optimal routes in Ipoh City, Malaysia. The results indicate a decline in the waste collection path up to a maximum 22%. In (Son, 2014 ), the ArcGIS is combined with Chaotic PSO to determine the optimal solutions in waste collection and vehicle routing. In (Vu etÂ al., 2019 ), the combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and GIS is proposed to optimize the garbage truck route duration and travel distance. In (Dehghani etÂ al., 2018 ), an optimal model is structured under GIS environment to effectively operate SWC in terms of storage, collection and transfer. In (Ferronato etÂ al., 2020 ), GIS systems are proposed to evaluate the activities of waste pickers leading to the minimization of SWC costs. In (Wu etÂ al., 2016 ), GIS has proven to become promising with regard to manage and quantify the waste demolition. The applications of GIS technology in SWC systems is illustrated in TableÂ 6  .  5.4 Application of advanced technologies in SWC With the rising concern of waste management and the collection system, the growth of the intelligent system, information technology and artificial intelligence have achieved huge attention in the SWC system. Information and communication technology (ICT) has been advancing tremendously to fulfill the growing necessities in terms of data acquisition, identification, communication, as well as storage and analysis to address the increasing problems in SWC. The ICT techniques used in SWC can be divided into three categories; data acquisition technologies, data communication technologies and data identification technologies, as shown in TableÂ 7  . Sensors and imaging can be categorized under data acquisition technologies. A study in (Catania and Ventura, 2014 ) proposed a smart waste collection system with proximity and weight sensors to monitor bin status. In (Mamun etÂ al., 2013 ), a novel prototype of a solid waste bin monitoring system is developed using a three-tier architecture where the sensor nodes are installed in the lower tier to monitor the status of waste filling level, the weight of waste, temperature and humidity inside the bin in real-time. In (Abdulla Al Mamun etÂ al., 2015 ), an ultrasonic sensor is used to estimate the level of waste in the bin. In (Narendra etÂ al., 2014 ), a light sensor is attached to every bin to determine when the bin is full. After the detection of the status of the bin, the information needs to be sent to the server. Data communication technologies do this in SWC. The global system for mobile communications (GSM), general packet radio service (GPRS), Wi-Fi exhibit long-range communication abilities while the ZigBee is employed for short-range communication technology. In (Kang etÂ al., 2020 ), an efficient e-waste SWC is proposed to guide the uses to the nearby e-waste collection box using GSM and centralized cloud database server. In (Karthikeyan etÂ al., 2018 ), an IoT based SWC system is proposed using the ZigBee network to identify the level of garbage in waste containers. The deployment of GPS, and RS in SWC is classified under the data identification technologies. The main functions of these technologies are to select the site, planning, waste estimation, traffic condition, scheduling, optimization and environmental impact assessment, etc. A new technique incorporating RS and GIS in SWC is developed in (Singh, 2019 ) with the aims to support monitoring and transmitting the required information at a fairly low cost. In (Wilson and Vincent, 2008 ), GPS is applied to collect field data regarding the schedules of waste collection vehicles traveled to different transfer facilities. The authors in (Hannan etÂ al., 2011 ) proposed an intelligent monitoring system with RFID along with GPRS and GIS using a waste bin and garbage truck database. In (Faccio etÂ al., 2011 ), an efficient waste collection routing model is proposed based on RFID, GPRS and GPS technologies to obtain real-time data optimizing the SWC and vehicle routing. The application of RFID technology can also be found in (Purohit and Bothale, 2011 ).   6 Discussion, issues and challenges To achieve sustainability in SWC by minimizing the vehicle route, operational cost, and carbon emission, the various algorithms are proposed to achieve the desired performance. An appropriate objective function helps to achieve the target in SWC with respect to cost, route, time, energy, emissions etc. subject to satisfying all constraints such as demand, capacity, human force, waste facilities etc. Nevertheless, the formulation of multi-objective functions needs laborious efforts and may not be accurate due to various uncertainties and complexity in SWC. Numerous SWC modeling approaches have been proposed in literatures to solve SWC issues. The conventional approaches can deliver satisfactory results under small-scale models but suffer from predicting good results against various uncertainties. The heuristic methods can achieve near-optimal solutions; however, they lack in precision and requires a long implementation time. The meta-heuristic methods have the flexibility in choosing suitable objectives, constraints under different conditions; nevertheless, they have shortcomings in terms of parameter setting and computation complexity. The fuzzy logic and probabilistic methods are very effective in modeling the SWC system under various uncertainties. Nonetheless, they require realistic data and human experience, thus leading to a complex framework. Various optimization methods have been employed to achieve significant solutions in the SWC system. However, the integration of optimization algorithms in a sophisticated and complicated system like SWC is an open research issue to be explored. PSO and ABC are quick, robust, and have few control parameters. But they have negative points on search capability which can be trapped into local minima. ACO has complex theoretical analysis but has guaranteed convergence speed and good adaption to changes in new solutions. GA and SA have an easy implementation process but suffer from slow convergence speed. TS has short computation time but has limitations with regard to search exploration, low efficiency and slow convergence. In recent times, the usage of artificial intelligence and information technology in SWC have become increasingly popular due to their high capability in assessing the level of garbage in waste containers, the quantity of waste as well as detecting and classifying the waste bin level. Various Data acquisition, communication and identification technologies have employed in SWC including sensors, GSM, ZigBee, GPRS, GPS etc. Besides, GIS is utilized to collect and optimize waste through the determination of suitable landfill. Although GIS is efficient in delivering the shortest route and time, the performance depends on the decision-making process with supporting tools and planning. Although researchers and municipalities have made great efforts to develop a new and effective SWC system, several key issues need to be taken into account to operate SWC model efficiently under the practical environment. Some of the key challenges of SWC are summarized below. 6.1 Multi-objective issues The formulation of multi-objective function is a laborious task since it is difficult to optimize two self-contradictory objectives at the same time without making one worse. For instance, there is very little chance that both waste content and distance or time will be optimized at the same time. Nevertheless, it is possible to improve the value of one objective without deteriorating that of the other in multi-objective optimization by using the set of Pareto optimal solutions. To tackle the issues of multi-objective problems, all the objectives are converted either into a single objective or some of these may be converted into constraints. But these techniques are not very effective as they generate a single solution per calculation. To this point, Pareto optimal solutions cannot be guaranteed. To map all frontier sets, calculations should be repeated numerous times which decreases the computational performance.  6.2 Economic impact Solid waste collection cost depends on several factors such as the area of the municipality, geographic condition of the municipality (hilly, plain land, etc.), the population size of the area, the feature of the area (residential, industrial, commercial, etc.), transportation modes used in the collection, number of crews assigned in the task, etc. Actually, a large percentage of operational cost is spent on fuel consumption during waste collection that depends on the factors of driving distance of the road and its gradient, condition of the collection vehicle (Tavares etÂ al., 2009 ), as well as quantity of the waste load (Larsen etÂ al., 2009 ). Therefore, designing an effective solid waste collection system considering the economic condition of the municipality is a challenge and a lot of factors are needed to be considered.  6.3 Environmental impact The environmental impacts can be categorized mainly in three categories: noise control, traffic congestion and air pollution. Noise control is taken into account especially in busy institutional and commercial areas where it may have a disturbing effect on the surroundings. Whereas, traffic congestion is a problem that rises other problems such as long collection hours, more fuel consumption, more expense, air pollution, etc. Air pollution is the biggest concern during solid waste collection. The waste collection vehicles may emit a significant amount of pollutants including GHGs (Tavares etÂ al., 2009 ). It is seen that by using compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG), tail-pipe emissions of collection vehicles are significantly less than the diesel-driven collection vehicle (Maimoun etÂ al., 2016 ). However, the availability of these fuels is uncertain and a huge amount of cost is required to convert existing vehicles to use natural gas.  6.4 Available technologies With the development of technology, the use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) is also increasing in SWC to monitor the waste collection process. For instance, in European countries, RFID technology with different sensors are employed for waste collection and recyclables (Hannan etÂ al., 2011 ). In Malaysia, the garbage truck monitoring system is introduced via GPS and GPRS (Hannan etÂ al., 2015 ). Although the application of different technology for waste collection monitoring has already been started, till now it is mostly in high-income countries only. Therefore, the feasibility of introducing these technologies in middle and low-income countries is yet to be studied.  6.5 Type of waste The same solid waste collection process cannot be implemented for collecting all types of waste. The waste quantity and composition are different in residential and commercial areas. Residential areas usually produce a small amount of waste including organic waste, while the commercial area is dominated by demolition and construction waste in large numbers (Singh etÂ al., 2011 ). Also in residential areas, waste collection is done by traveling the street back and forth, whereas, in commercial areas waste collection is more location focused (Wy etÂ al., 2013 ). Therefore, making different collection strategies for the different waste generated area makes the waste collection system complicated.  6.6 Safety issues The safety of the crew assigned to waste collection is an important factor. As they always keep in touch with different waste components, deterioration of their health is quite apparent. They face more problems, specifically, in developing countries due to the lack of proper law enforcement. A portion of hazardous material produced in bulk in developed countries is handled properly in an expensive manner, whereas, in low-income countries, a large percentage of the generated waste is thrown in open spaces, resulting in an unhealthy condition.  6.7 Waste disposal issues The leakage of toxicants from waste dumps significantly pollutes local soil, water and groundwater. The aging of these landfills seriously affects the mineralization process and dynamics of toxic elements in wastes (Gupta etÂ al., 2015 ). Hence, it is essential to study on aging and physical properties of waste. Paul etÂ al. (2019)  explored the characteristics of waste concerning different layers related to aging. Also, the study estimated the environmental hazards and waste-to-wealth conversion efficiency through vermicomposting technology. Moreover, waste can be converted into manure which offers many benefits in terms of retaining nutrients, helping the growth of plants, promoting microbial activity and enhancing soil fertility (Sudharmaidevi etÂ al., 2017 ). A study by (Yeheyis etÂ al., 2013 ), analyzed the lifecycle of industrial construction projects to design a sustainable and comprehensive construction and demolition (C & D) waste management system toward maximizing the 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle) and minimizing the waste disposal.   7 Solid waste collection in sustainable development goal The 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs), proposed in 2015 offers a common vision for prosperity and peace for the planet and people (Vinuesa etÂ al., 2020 ). SWC and optimization can be directly or indirectly linked to 10 out of 17 SDGs. SWC affects several domains of SDG including environment, public health, poverty and resource value. The affected domains include clean water, good health, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, clean energy, sustainable cities, economic development, access to green jobs and sustainable natural resource utilization. TableÂ 8   and Fig.Â 2   illustrate the 10 SDGs with their related goals and links to the optimization of SWC introduced in this study. Several relevant studies have been explored to validate the relationship between SWC and the target of SDGs. For instance, SWC can ensure environmentally sound disposal of waste (Singh, 2019 ), eliminate open dumping (Pujara etÂ al., 2019 ) and protect water, soil from chemically toxic waste (Chandra Manna etÂ al., 2018 ) that is linked to the target of SDG 6.3, 12.4 and 15.1 respectively. Besides, SWC can generate renewable energy from (organic) waste which is associated with the target of SDG 7.2. Moreover, SWC can control a large number of carbon emissions (Rajaeifar etÂ al., 2017 ) and prevent waste (especially plastics) from entering the oceans (Luttenberger, 2020 ) that can be related to the target of SDG 13 and 14.1 respectively. Furthermore, SWC technology improves air quality in cities (Hossain etÂ al., 2011 ) and promotes urbanization as well as slum up-gradation through efficient recycling and management of solid waste (Azevedo etÂ al., 2019 ), thus linking to the target of SDG 11.6 and 11.1, respectively. The optimized SWC also has positive impacts on human health by preventing many diseases such as Hepatitis A, B, C, and HIV/AIDS and malaria (Zolnikov etÂ al., 2018 ) which can be linked to the target of SDG 3.2, 3.3 and 3.9. SWC can act as a sustainable model to promote economic progress (Elagroudy etÂ al., 2016 ) and create potential job opportunities (Pini etÂ al., 2019 ) which can be associated with the target of SDG 8.3 and 1.4, respectively. Moreover, SWC can minimize waste through the implementation of 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) (Laustsen, 2007 ) as well as reduce food losses (Lemaire and Limbourg, 2019 ), which is related to the target of SDG 12.5 and 12.3 respectively. Overall, the analyzed results show that optimization and the latest innovation employed in SWC can achieve the SDGs efficiently related to good health, poverty reduction, sustainable cities, marine emissions minimization and economic growth which contribute toward achieving the 10 out of the 17 SDGs. Thus, contributions of this study can increase the effort toward achieving SDG-2030 by controlling and optimizing the SWC, therefore contributing to social benefits, economic growth and environmental protection.  8 Conclusions and recommendations The numerous research and development are carried out on SWC modeling structure, and technology to lower cost, route, time, labour and carbon emissions. An improved and effective optimization strategy can ensure the resilient, sustainable, and economic operation of SWC systems. However, the coordination of optimization techniques and the latest technology employed in SWC needs more investigations to achieve the desired goal under various realistic constraints. Moreover, the role of SWC in achieving SDGs needs to be assessed to determine the substantial impacts on human life, sanitation, poverty, climate, and employment. This review summarizes a vast study of waste collection approaches including different models, constraints, optimization topics, technologies that have been introduced in the literature. From the studies reviewed, it is observed that conventional methods are used in common at an early stage. Then, heuristics and meta-heuristic have replaced the conventional methods due to the increased complexity of the collection problem and computational time. It is also noticed that the use of GIS is very common in all SWC modeling approaches. Currently, with the development of advanced technologies, including RFID, GPS, GPRS, etc., along with smart bins and different sensors are given huge attention. These technologies are being used to monitor the whole SWC scenario from a remote server and have the decision-making ability to deliver the best optimal solutions under various constraints. The review also demonstrates the strong relationship of the 10 (out of 17) sustainable development objectives with the SWC. However, the development of an intelligent SWC system remains a vital issue to be explored due to the lack of effective policies introduced in different countries. In the context of the above discussions, this review provides some useful recommendations for future research direction, such as.i) The objective functions are formulated with respect to fulfilling the constraints. However, in most cases, the list of constraints reported in literature are very common. The exiting SWC models are developed considering a few types of constraints. Various factors could influence the SWC model including waste collection rate, waste coverage, waste collection efficiency, personnel capacity, institutional arrangement, management plan, policy, legal frameworks, financial resources, budgetÂ allocation, political interest, social networks and social learning. Therefore, the maximum numbers of constraints need to be considered for making the study more accurate.  ii) The successful operation of the optimization algorithm depends on how the constraints are operated regardless of the changing environment. However, in majority cases, the conditions of constraints are challenging to sustain in real world environment. Specially, unavoidable uncertainty is an important issue in environmental impact assessment predictions. Thus, the inclusion of various uncertainties into constraints needs further studies.  iii) Numerous optimization methods have been employed in SWC; however, they have drawbacks in terms of slow convergence, complex theory, poor search capability and tiresome parameters tuning. Thus, the development of efficient and robust optimization methods in SWC is required to obtain better results in terms of cost, travel distance and emissions.  iv) The performance of optimization algorithms can be further enhanced with the integration of advanced technologies. Nevertheless, there are concerns on the deployment of ICT in SWC such as accuracy, transmission range, data transfer rate and security. Consequently, a strategy on ICT and optimization algorithm development is highly desirable to avoid the ICT deployment concerns. Hence, further studies should be conducted on the integration of optimization methods into recent technologies.  v) The main aims of SWC models are to reduce cost, travel distance and emission. Usually, these targets are fulfilled simultaneously through the construction of multi-objective functions. Nevertheless, multi-objective optimization may create contradiction by making one worse. Since it is difficult to reach the optimum solutions for all the objective functions simultaneously, the concept of compromise solutions can be employed. Thus, further attention is needed to improve the performance of Pareto optimal solutions with regards to equity and efficiency. Pareto optimality highlights the best segment between the multi-objective functions.  vi) The SWC has strong influences on health, economic, environment, and energy conservation, that subsequently build a relationship with SDGs. Since the significance and complexity of SWC are more prominent than before, the relationship between SWC and SDGs achievement needs more exploration towards future sustainability in the domain of environment, poverty reduction, health and economic growth.    The information provided in this review can play a vital role in the improvement of waste collection and management towards an economic and sustainable development in future research applications.
