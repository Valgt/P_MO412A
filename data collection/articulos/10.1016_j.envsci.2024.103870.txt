                  Global momentum to address plastic pollution has led to the development of national processes to monitor plastics into and within the environment. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide guidance for reporting on plastic pollution, although compiling national estimates remains a challenge. Data availability remains a key barrier, which could be addressed through engagement with the citizen science community, which collects and maintains data at a resolution suitable for SDG reporting. Here, we demonstrate a process that uses citizen science monitoring of plastic debris on beaches to report on SDGs at the national scale. The study uses the Australian Marine Debris Initiative (AMDI) Database, which is composed of data submissions from over 1400 organisations across Australia. The AMDI was used to provide initial estimates of plastic debris density both nationally and across Natural Resource Management areas (NRMs). Before analysis, the database was filtered for data quality and alignment with guidance for SDG reporting (i.e., SDG Indicator 14.1.1b), resulting in the analysis of 3144 events across 538 sites between 2014 and 2019 (inclusive). The average density of plastic debris on beaches across Australia was between 0.155 and 0.279 counts m−2, with management relevant trends identified across NRMs. This study demonstrates the potential for the citizen science community to support SDG reporting and management processes, which could inform and enable actions to address plastic pollution.

Global momentum to address plastic pollution has led to the development of national processes to monitor plastics into and within the environment. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide guidance for reporting on plastic pollution, although compiling national estimates remains a challenge. Data availability remains a key barrier, which could be addressed through engagement with the citizen science community, which collects and maintains data at a resolution suitable for SDG reporting. Here, we demonstrate a process that uses citizen science monitoring of plastic debris on beaches to report on SDGs at the national scale. The study uses the Australian Marine Debris Initiative (AMDI) Database, which is composed of data submissions from over 1400 organisations across Australia. The AMDI was used to provide initial estimates of plastic debris density both nationally and across Natural Resource Management areas (NRMs). Before analysis, the database was filtered for data quality and alignment with guidance for SDG reporting (i.e., SDG Indicator 14.1.1b), resulting in the analysis of 3144 events across 538 sites between 2014 and 2019 (inclusive). The average density of plastic debris on beaches across Australia was between 0.155 and 0.279 counts m−2 , with management relevant trends identified across NRMs. This study demonstrates the potential for the citizen science community to support SDG reporting and management processes, which could inform and enable actions to address plastic pollution.

The exponential increase in plastic production, coupled with inadequate safe disposal and persistence within the environment, has led to the widespread contamination of marine environments (Bergmann et al., 2022 ). Further, the volume of plastic released into the ocean is expected to increase well into the future (Jambeck et al., 2015, Edelson et al., 2021 ). The exposure of marine habitats and species to plastics has been linked to a suite of impacts, including the deterioration of species and ecosystem health (Thompson et al., 2009, Beaumont et al., 2019 ) and impacts to economic sectors and coastal livelihoods (McIlgorm et al., 2022 ). Growing concern over the threats posed by plastic pollution has led to policy and management interventions targeting plastic pollution at multiple scales (Helm et al., 2023, Diana et al., 2022 ). The trans-boundary nature of plastic pollution has prompted international efforts to address the challenge, with recent advancements towards a legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution and marine litter (March et al., 2022 ). In parallel, several countries have developed National Action Plans that coordinate strategies towards the reduction of plastics into and within the environment (Evans et al., 2023, Walker et al., 2021 ) and could also align with potential commitments contained within the treaty in negotiation at the time of writing (Raubenheimer and Urho, 2020 ). An existing international framework to address plastic pollution is embedded within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda contains 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were adopted by UN Member States in 2015 to provide a framework for long-term peace and prosperity for people and the environment (UNGA, 2015 ). Each SDG is divided into targets and their indicators, where the former defines the actions needed to achieve goals. SDG indicators are used to measure progress towards achieving each target. The reduction of plastic pollution is aligned with several SDGs and their targets, including the responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), and the conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment (SDG 14) (UN DESA, 2022, Recuero Virto, 2018 ). Measuring the reduction of plastic pollution is related to SDG Target 14.1, which aims to “prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds by 2025 ”. Guidance for the specific indicator for measuring the reduction in plastic debris density (identified as SDG Indicator 14.1.1b) was developed in 2021 (UNEP, 2021a ). The guidance details further sub-indicators to measure plastic debris density within the marine domain across various spatial scales and a range of marine habitats (i.e., beaches, sea surface, water column and seafloor). Few countries, however, have reported on plastic debris density in a systematic and representative manner (although see Fraisl et al., 2023 ). The lack of country reporting on SDG Indicator 14.1.1b may be linked to the recent development of guidance and limited access to the plastic debris data required to compile indicators at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Most efforts in reporting on plastic debris density have been drawn from beach debris surveys, due to the relative ease of methods and low resource cost, compared to surveys of the seafloor and water column (GESAMP, 2019 ). Monitoring programs to collect beach debris data have been established by governments in several countries, in addition to academic surveys that collect data covering large areas or high-resolution timeseries, but seldom both (Serra-Gonçalves et al., 2019 ). A large proportion of data collected globally is by the citizen science community (Kawabe et al., 2022 ). There are many volunteer initiatives that remove plastic from beaches, although some take further actions to develop methods for surveying, classifying and collecting data, analyse data to infer trends, and disseminate findings. These initiatives can be considered the “citizen science community”, and often involves collaboration across multiple organizations, such as community groups, government, and research institutions (see definitions in Eitzel et al., 2017 ). These communities volunteer their time, labour, and resources to collect such data, document environmental impacts, raise awareness and advocate for action. Citizen science initiatives vary in scale, from local to national, and many focus on coastal surveys (Kawabe et al., 2022 ). For example, the initiative Científicos de la Basura  began in Chile (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2018 ) and has since expanded across the West-coast of Central and South America (De Veer et al., 2023 ). Researchers engage with a network of schools and other stakeholders to survey beach debris annually, while also increasing awareness of pollution and providing environmental education (Gallardo et al., 2021 ). Other citizen science initiatives operating at the national scale have been developed in New Zealand,1  1 Litter Intelligence, launched in May 2019 and coordinated by Sustainable Coastlines: https://litterintelligence.org/  (Accessed 26/05/2023)   the United Kingdom (Nelms et al., 2017 ) and China (Chen et al., 2020 ). There are few examples, however, of citizen science debris monitoring linked to a country’s official SDG reporting activities (although see Ghana, Olen, 2022 ). Australia has enacted several policies to address plastic pollution, including national (DAWE, 2021 ) and state plans to address the use, disposal, recycling, and release of plastics into the environment. The National Plastics Plan commits to reducing the amount of plastics impacting Australia’s environment, through actions such as targeting legacy plastics within the environment, cigarette butts, and release from stormwater networks (DAWE, 2021 ). Similar goals and targets are defined within State plans for New South Wales (NSW Government, 2021 ), Queensland (Queensland Government, 2021 ) and Western Australia (Government of Western Australia, 2021 ). The most recent SDG progress report from Australia did not report on marine pollution (SDG Target 14.1) (Thwaites et al., 2020 ) and only two studies have reported on plastics at the national scale (Hardesty et al., 2017, Willis et al., 2022 ). As Australia has the third largest Exclusive Economic Zone, with a coastline of over 30,000 km, there are significant challenges to monitoring plastic pollution. Australia is host to the largest citizen science database of marine debris in the southern hemisphere in the Australian Marine Debris Initiative (AMDI) Database (Gacutan et al., 2022b ). The initiative was previously identified as having significant potential to support SDG reporting as data submissions to the AMDI use consistent methods and classifications that align with the needs for SDG Indicators concerning marine debris (Fraisl et al., 2020 ). In this study, we demonstrate the utility of a national citizen science initiative of marine debris monitoring within Australia, as a case study for enabling the use of citizen science in national SDG reporting. We provide the first estimates of plastic debris density (SDG Indicator 14.1.1b) on beaches at a continental and sub-national scale. We go beyond the minimum requirements presented by existing guidance for the SDG Indicator to explore ‘remoteness,’ to facilitate the use of the SDG Indicator for management. The study also provides recommendations to enable the use of citizen science for official country SDG reporting concerning marine debris.  2 The plastic debris indicator The SDG Indicators allow United Nations (UN) Member States to measure their progress in achieving SDG targets. Many have been iteratively updated since 2015, with the indicator on marine litter (SDG Indicator 14.1.1b) defined in July 2020 (UNSD, 2020 ) ( Fig. 1 ). Each SDG target and associated indicators is assigned to a ‘custodian agency’ which is mandated to engage countries in data collection and reporting. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is responsible for the target on marine pollution (SDG 14.1) and has established further guidance for sub-indicators on marine plastic density at three scales (global, national and sub-national) (UNEP, 2021b ). Countries are only requested to collate and report on the plastics debris indicator at the national scale  (see Fig. 1 ), which is composed of sub-indicators of plastic debris density on (i) beaches, (ii) sea surface, (iii) water column and (iv) seabed (UNEP, 2021b ). The UNEP approaches country governments for the data and statistics, although the process is voluntary, and country led. Further information on the global and supplementary indicators may be found in the guidance by UNEP (2021b) . As most empirical plastic debris data is sourced from coastal surveys (Serra-Gonçalves et al., 2019 ), the present study focuses on data collection and reporting of plastic debris density on beaches . The sub-indicator has three requirements, namely:• Counts of plastic debris, omitting other debris materials (e.g., rubber, glass, textiles),  • Debris on beaches, as opposed to other coastal morphologies (e.g., rocky shores, mangroves, and estuarine habitats), and  • Density, requiring the reporting of the area sampled (i.e., counts m−2 )    Data could be collated from projects and initiatives at a variety of spatial scales (e.g., local, and sub-national), although reporting on the SDG Indicator requires the aggregation of data into a single statistic to represent debris across the country.  3 Methods 3.1 Study context This study assessed an indicator for plastic debris within continental Australia (including the island of Tasmania) and sub-nationally through Natural Resource Management (NRM) regions ( Fig. 2 ). 2  2 A Natural Resource Management (NRM) Region is a geographic area designated for the purpose of managing and conserving natural resources, as defined by the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992 (Cwth) and the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act 1997 (Cwth).   Further disaggregation of the indicator to NRMs was chosen for relevance to federal management and their use in reporting on environmental pressures. As of September 2022, Australia’s population is over 26 million people (ABS, 2023 ), with 87 % of Australians living within 50 km of the coast (ABS, 2020 ). At the continental scale, the Australian coast is influenced by four major ocean currents, namely the Antarctic Circumpolar, Leeuwin, East Australian currents and Indonesian Throughflow. These flows are further modified by local conditions, which influence the arrival and accumulation of plastic debris on beaches (Critchell and Lambrechts, 2016 ).  3.2 Plastic beach debris data The AMDI Database was established in 2004 and employs a ‘network’ approach to acquiring debris data. The AMDI provides guidance for performing clean-up events, classifying recovered marine debris from coastal environments, and submitting the subsequent data to a central database. Over 1400 institutions have submitted data, and include federal and state governments, non-government organizations (NGOs), private sector, academia, and schools. At the time of writing (May 2023), the database contained over 31,000 clean-up events, accounting for over 22 million debris items. The number of sites increased after 2014 (see Supplementary Materials , SM) and this study filtered the database for entries between 2014 and 2019 (inclusive). Clean-up events were conducted with the aim of the exhaustive removal of macro-debris (defined in this study as >5 mm, see review Frias and Nash, 2019 ), from the water to vegetation line. Recovered items were classified into 140 categories, which could be aggregated into 10 materials. Three material categories relate to plastics, classified into ‘hard,’ ‘soft’ and ‘expanded’ plastic items. The AMDI defines hard plastics as rigid (e.g., plastic lids, plastic bottles), whilst ‘soft’ plastics as flexible and thin items, used for wrapping or storing food items (e.g., plastic bags, plastic wrap). ‘Expanded’ plastic refer to items composed of light, spongy plastics, produced by introducing pockets of air or gas. Counts per event were filtered to plastic items, with relevant classifications are provided in the Supplementary Materials . Items not found at clean-ups were assumed absent and assigned a count of ‘zero’. Clean-up data entry is facilitated by a mobile application, with totals checked by a trained site supervisor prior to submission to the AMDI Database. The AMDI is monitored by several ‘data teams’ and a database manager, that further inspects for data quality before accepting entry into the database. The manager examines, among other factors, the information recorded for each event and ensures it includes accurate metadata, such as the number of volunteers, clean-up duration, length of beach cleaned, GPS site coordinates (latitude, longitude) and a polygon of the area cleaned.  3.3 Database filtering Data quality within the AMDI Database is variable. We undertook several stages of filtering to improve data quality, explored in full in Gacutan et al. (2022b) . For example, entries with missing or erroneous metadata were filtered out and analysis was limited to only events conducted over a specific point in time (i.e., a single day or multiple adjacent days). As exhaustive removal was assumed (i.e., all surface debris recovered), analyses were only performed for events that surveyed less than 500 m across the length of the beach. The plastic debris density was calculated for each event between 2014 and 2019 by aggregating all plastic items recovered and dividing by the estimated area sampled (i.e., count m−2 ). Only NRMs that contained more than two sites sampled per year were considered. As explored in Section 2 , guidance for the plastic debris indicator for beaches defines the required value as the density of plastic debris items on a ‘beach’ at a national scale. To align with the requirements of plastic debris density, (i) the counts of hard, soft, and expanded plastic items categories were separated from the total count and then aggregated, and (ii) the area for each clean-up was calculated using the reported area during each clean-up and event. This study advances the ‘representativeness’ of the indicator, going beyond the guidance requirements. The study limited analysis to ocean-facing, sandy beaches as performed in Gacutan et al. (2022b) , using the following criteria:• Sampled sites were beaches, as a landform alongside a body of water consisting of loose particles (c.f. , rocky shores),  • Most of the substrate was sand (c.f. , mud, pebble, rocks), and  • Beaches were located along the coastline and facing the open ocean (c.f. , estuary or river mouth beach facing landwards).    In addition, many studies use coastal populations as a proxy for debris release. This study calculated the plastic debris indicator for each NRM region and ‘remoteness area’ class, derived from the Accessibility and Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA+) and released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS, 2021 ). Each site was assigned to one of the five classes of ‘Remoteness Area’ (Major cities, Inner regional, Outer regional, Remote and Very remote). The overall class of NRM remoteness was determined by calculating the intersect between the sampled sites within the NRM and Remoteness Area and identifying the majority remoteness class.  3.4 Statistical analysis As the frequency of clean-up events varied temporally across NRM and remoteness areas, statistical analysis was conducted to determine if the number of events was significantly related to the calculated plastic debris indicator values. All statistical analyses were performed in R (v3.6), using ‘glmmTMB’ (v1.0) (Magnusson et al., 2017 ), and considered significant at α < 0.05. A linear mixed model (LMM) was used to test the plastic debris indicator (response variable) against the number of events per year, using either ‘NRM’ or ‘remoteness area’ as a random effect. Model validation was performed using Q-Q and residual plots via the ‘DHARMa’ package (Hartig and Hartig, 2017 ).   4 Results Between 2014 and 2019, the AMDI Database contained 14,224 events from 2859 unique sites across Australia. Filtering for data quality resulted in 12,764 events (90 % of total events) and 2654 sites (93 % of total sites). Subsequent filtering to events at ocean-facing, sandy beaches limited analyses to 3627 events (25 % of total events) across 746 sites (26 % of total sites) (see SM, Figure SM2). The last filtering process involved selecting the NRMs that contained more than 2 sites sampled per year. Of the 37 NRM regions along the coast, 18 NRMs met the criteria, accounting for 3144 events (22 % of total events) across 538 sites (19 % of total sites), with site distribution presented in Fig. 2 . The sites remaining after filtering covered most of the Australian coastline, with concentrations across capital cities and the East coast of Australia. Across Australia, the mean number of sites for NRMs was 30 (SD = 17.6), with the number of events varying across NRMs per year ( Table 1 ). The highest number of unique sites sampled across the study period were observed in the South East NSW NRM (77 sites), while the least were in the Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges (5 sites) (Table 1 ). Gaps in coverage were evident across the Great Australian Bight (between Western and South Australia), Gulf of Carpentaria (between the Northern Territory and North-West Queensland) and the northern coastline of Western Australia (marked in Fig. 2 A). Data from the AMDI Database identified an average plastic debris count across Australia between 0.155 and 0.279 counts m−2  for study beaches between 2014 and 2019 ( Table 2 ), with the standard deviation for Australia and each NRM presented in the Supplementary Materials . Across the study NRMs, the plastic debris indicator for Greater Sydney and Cape York were greater than the national average for all years (see also Fig SM3-SM5). The magnitude of debris was greatest within the Cape York NRM (in Far North Queensland), where a peak of 3.74 counts m−2  was observed in 2018, which was 18 times the national average for Australia for that year. In contrast, the Northern Territory, Northern Agricultural Region, and Rangeland Region NRMs were less than the national average across all years (Table 2 ; Fig SM3–5). Debris was least dense in the Rangeland Region NRM, at 0.002 counts m−2  (Table 2 ). The density of plastic debris on beaches across Australia increased between 2014 and 2017, although by 2019, debris density decreased and returned to levels lower than observed in 2014. Differences between the study start and end year varied across all NRMs. The standard deviation for plastic debris density across Australia and NRMs are presented in the Supplementary Materials . When assessing plastic debris density against Remoteness classes, the magnitude was greatest in the ‘Remote’ and ‘Major Cities’ classes, which were consistently above the national average across most years, with peaks at 0.738 counts m−2  in 2015 and 0.337 counts m−2  in 2017, respectively (Table SM2;  Fig. 3 ). Debris was least dense in the ‘Inner Regional’ class at 0.057 counts m−2  in 2019. In terms of trends between 2014 and 2019, ‘Major Cities’ appeared stable, while density decreased in both Inner and Outer Regional classes after 2016 (Fig. 3 , Table SM2;). The ‘Very Remote’ class showed an increase over time, at 128 % over the study period. Linear mixed models were used to examine if there were relationships between the SDG Indicator for plastic debris density and the number of sites per NRM and Remoteness class. Neither model identified a significant relationship between the indicator and debris density or remoteness class ( Table 3 ).  5 Discussion 5.1 Comparison with other plastic density estimates This study presents one of the first national estimates of plastic debris density on beaches specifically aligned with the requirements for SDG Indicator 14.1.1b reporting. The present study observed a national average for plastic debris on beaches across Australia between 0.155 and 0.279 counts m−2  for the period between 2014 and 2019. The observed densities were lower than other country estimates within the Asia-Pacific region, between 6 – 50 counts m−2  (Serra-Gonçalves et al., 2019 ), although these studies did not focus specifically on plastic debris. Higher observed densities align with the estimated release of debris from rivers watersheds within the region (Lebreton et al., 2017 ). The present study observed higher densities than previous national estimates within Australia. Despite the aggregation to debris generally, Hardesty et al. (2017)  estimated 0.147 counts m−2  for beach debris across Australia (1 replicate per site, between 2011 and 2013) and a follow-up study by Willis et al. (2022)  reported an average density of 0.133 counts m−2  (also 1 replicate per site, between 2018 and 2019). Those studies, however, had few sites in major cities and did not cover Cape York. The Cape York NRM had the highest debris density observed within this study, which aligns with previous debris observed across the state of Queensland (Gacutan et al., 2023b ). The selection of sites sampled at the sub-national scale will influence the compilation of the national SDG Indicator. The utility of the SDG Indicator 14.1.1b in comparing between countries is limited due to differences in factors such as sampling effort, coastlines, demographics, and the high variability in plastic debris density estimates. For countries with a long coastline and relatively concentrated population centres, such as Australia, a wide spatial distribution of sites may lower the national average of plastic debris density. In contrast, countries with shorter coastlines and sites sampling urban centres may increase the national estimated value. Further guidance is needed towards achieving a “representative” sampling strategy for the SDG indicator within country context (UNEP, 2021b ). We suggest that the SDG Indicator for plastic debris density is more useful in examining changes over time domestically, rather than as a comparator between countries.  5.2 Extending SDG Indicator 14.1.1b for management Reporting for SDG 14.1.1b only requires a national estimate, although aggregation at the sub-national scale could prove useful in understanding drivers of plastic debris density and evaluating the effectiveness of management and policies. To demonstrate the utility of the SDG Indicator to management, the study assessed links with ‘Remoteness areas’ across Australia. Before exploring trends, we determined there were no significant relationship between the number of sites per NRMs nor per Remoteness area when compiling the SDG Indicator (Table 3 ). High densities of plastic debris, relative to the national average, were identified in both the most populated (e.g., Greater Sydney NRM) and very remote areas (e.g., Cape York NRM) of Australia. Previous assessments using the AMDI have identified ‘hotspots’ near the capital cities, potentially driven by the land-based release of plastics through littering or illegal dumping (Gacutan et al., 2022b ), with similar trends observed in the UK (Nelms et al., 2017 ) and China (Chen et al., 2020 ). A two-fold increase in debris density within Cape York NRM in 2018 could be related to cyclones in the region, and similar trends were observed in beach debris in Hong Kong after a cyclone in 2018 (Lo et al., 2020 ). In assessing Remoteness classes, analyses per NRM suggests differing drivers across Australia. In general, greater densities were observed in the ‘remote’ class, relative to ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ regional areas (Fig. 3 ). The ‘very remote’ class was similar in the density of plastic debris to regional areas, due to averaging the highest and lowest observed densities within Australia, for Cape York and Rangelands Region, respectively. This suggests differing drivers within these very remote sites, which could be related to debris arrival from further afield. The location of Cape York and its surrounding currents may drive debris accumulation, as observed in a previous study (Gacutan et al., 2023b ), which may differ to the coastline of the Rangelands Region. Few studies have assessed the density of beach debris over longer time periods and sequential years (e.g., >1 year) and at larger spatial scales (Serra-Gonçalves et al., 2019 ). There were no clear trends nationally and across all NRMs. Our analyses showed the national average plastic density peaked in 2017 and subsequently decreased until 2019, with similar trends in 5 NRMs (Swan Region, Mackay Whitsunday, Northern Territory, Hunter, and North Coast). In total, 12 of the 18 study NRMs demonstrated a decrease from the 2014 baseline year, although the magnitude of change varied by region. For example, the density of debris increased in Greater Sydney by 240 %, while others showed a decrease of up to 92 % (Burnett Mary, from 0.508 to 0.036 counts m−2 ) over the study period. Similar variability in debris density could be observed for national and regional analyses of beaches in Chile (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2018 ). Values at increasingly smaller scales should be carefully interpreted when aggregated due to the large variability in debris recovered per site and the environmental and climatic factors that influence debris at multiple scales.  5.3 Policy relevance The SDG Indicators motivate countries to establish processes through, or in collaboration with, the National Statistical Office (NSO), to collect a diverse range of data to compile novel statistics and indicators (Bexell and Jönsson, 2019 ). Many NSOs have limited experience working beyond economic and demographic data, and SDG Indicators (including SDG 14.1.1b) pose a significant challenge to their capacity and experience (MacFeely, 2019 ). By familiarizing NSOs with marine debris data, reporting processes may be established that address current and future commitments, including potential outcomes of the legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution currently under negotiation (Walker, 2022 ). Once compiled, the SDG Indicator for plastic debris density could further inform domestic policy and management at a variety of scales. Within the Australian context, these preliminary estimates provide a baseline to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies, in line with the National and State Plastic Plans. Most interventions, such as single-use plastic bans, occur after the study period (i.e., post-2019) with a rolling implementation of bans for other plastic items planned until 2025 (Bering and Karasik, 2022 ). An annual timeseries of plastic debris density at the NRM level could be used to identify ‘hotspots’ that require intervention, and enable analyses of physical and human factors that drive the accumulation of plastic debris on beaches and other environments, such as those conducted for Queensland (Gacutan et al., 2023b ). In addition, analyses could be conducted for specific plastic items (e.g., plastic bags and bottles) to evaluate specific policies and determine potential sources, such as contributions from foreign sources or sea-based dumping (e.g., Serra-Gonçalves et al., 2023 ). The compilation of the SDG Indicator may also be used for reporting and risk assessments of plastic pollution. The Australian State of the Environment (SOE) Report is designed to shape strategy, policy, and action of the national government in mitigating impacts on the environment. The SOE uses multiple types of citizen science data to inform management and policy, including a focus on plastic pollution using data from the AMDI Database in the 2021 SOE Report (DCCEEW, 2022 ). Future Report releases could use the SDG Indicator to track pressures from plastics to specific environments. The AMDI has previously been used to shape a threat and risk assessment of marine debris within NSW (Gacutan et al., 2022a, DPE, 2022 ), and the SDG Indicator presents an additional quantitative indicator to track exposure to and potential risks of plastic pollution to key ecosystems and natural assets.  5.4 Citizen science and national SDG reporting Data fragmentation and access remains a key limitation for national estimates of plastic debris density globally. The citizen science community is an underutilised resource that can play a vital role in collating and structuring data towards national and sub-national estimates (Fraisl et al., 2020 ). Citizen science collaborations with the Australian government at the national level are incipient, although this study demonstrates how data from the citizen science community could enable national reporting. Successful partnerships between citizen science initiatives and NSOs have already emerged in Ghana and New Zealand, leading to the development of official statistics. These initiatives could provide experiences and lessons to Australia and other countries in SDG reporting and partnering with the citizen science community. Through a dedicated initiative to embed citizen science data into SDG Indicators (CS4SDGs), a partnership was established between the Ghana Statistical Service, several national ministries, NGOs, and local citizen science organizations (Fraisl et al., 2023 ). The project enabled Ghana to become the first country to report on SDG Indicator 14.1.1b using citizen science data and demonstrated the opportunity of citizen science for official statistics (Olen, 2022 ). The project was enabled by mapping priorities and coordination of relevant stakeholders, harmonizing efforts for data and data validation conducted by a government ministry. The Ghana Statistical Service is exploring strategies for integrating further citizen science data to inform the development of Ghana’s Ocean Plan. Litter Intelligence3  3 Litter Intelligence, launched in May 2019 and coordinated by Sustainable Coastlines: https://litterintelligence.org/  (Accessed 26/05/2023)   within New Zealand is a consortium of citizen science initiatives coordinated by Sustainable Coastlines in collaboration with the Ministry for the Environment, Department of Conservation and Statistics New Zealand. At the time of writing, Litter Intelligence contained 315 sites with over 1500 surveys. The collection and reporting of the data align with UNEP requirements, although has yet to inform SDG reporting. Plastic debris density estimates, however, have been included in reports by Fisheries New Zealand (Ministry of Primary Industries) (Behrens et al., 2021 ) and Statistics New Zealand annual reporting on waste flows in waterways.4  4 Statistics New Zealand (Stats NZ) Wellbeing Indicators – Waste: https://statisticsnz.shinyapps.io/wellbeingindicators/_w_6092ff77/?page=indicators&class=Environment&type=Waste  (Accessed 26/05/2023)   Further integration of citizen science data into national reporting could be limited by variability in data quality and consistency, which stems from the differing accuracy of surveys, with methods varying between groups collecting data and differing standards of data validation (Bird et al., 2014 ). There are also ethical considerations related to recognition and reciprocity for volunteers and groups providing data, and ownership in the supply of such data to government agencies (Turnhout et al., 2016 ). Addressing these challenges requires support and coordination from governmental and institutional bodies.  5.5 Enabling citizen science monitoring Several enabling factors could further collaboration and equitable data sharing between the government agencies responsible for SDG reporting and the citizen science community. Recurring themes within Ghana (Olen, 2022 ), New Zealand and other citizen science projects globally, suggest the importance of clear communication, official recognition and investment, and data sharing agreements (Gacutan et al., 2023a ). A first step towards collaboration is early and open dialogue, to communicate the expectations for official statistics and understand the concerns and expectations of the citizen science community. For example, national statisticians may be concerned with data collection methods, quality, and accuracy, while the citizen science community may wish to understand how their data would be used (e.g., SDG reporting, other policy processes) and the processes leading to tangible actions (Fritz et al., 2019 ). Workshops exploring existing partnerships could provide mutual understanding in sharing existing experiences in enabling collaboration, such as strategies to address concerns over citizen science data (Bird et al., 2014 ) and specifically that of marine debris (Gacutan et al., 2022b ). Another challenge is the harmonization of data for national data aggregation, as classifications and collection methods differ across numerous stakeholders. While guidance for the collection of debris data and metadata may exist at the global (GESAMP, 2019 ) and regional scales (Addamo et al., 2018, Fleet et al., 2021 ), government leadership is needed to (i) establish guidance and standards suited to the national context, and (ii) incentivise the use of such guidance through grants and other support programs. Data collection by the citizen science community is usually motivated by local concerns and may target specific items or areas, where established guidance could enable future data collection that aligns with local need as well as SDG reporting (as described in Section 2 ), and current and future commitments. Engagement requires considerable investment, in both time and resources, to implement the methods and classifications established for monitoring. Monitoring protocols may require equipment and formal survey methods (e.g., replicates, transects, quadrats) that require the provision of coordination, training, and resourcing (GESAMP, 2019 ). A previous collaboration between the Australian Government and the Tangaroa Blue Foundation through the ReefClean programme5  5 ReefClean is funded by the Australian Government's Reef Trust and delivered by Tangaroa Blue Foundation, alongside local partners. (Project: Clean up and prevention of marine debris (Phase VI)): https://www.dcceew.gov.au/about/news/collective-action-keeping-reefclean  (accessed 1/06/2023)   enabled a monitoring network of 18 beach sites spread across 6 NRMs and over 1800 kms of coastline of Queensland (Gacutan et al., 2023b ). Monitoring was conducted using replicate, segmented transects that enabled an analysis of debris density and potential drivers of accumulation. Successful delivery was enabled through resourcing workshops, training materials, and coordinating volunteers to enable regular, quarterly sampling.  5.6 Limitations and future work A key limitation to SDG reporting on plastic debris density is the lack of guidance concerning the ‘representativeness’ of sites when aggregating to a national estimate. As demonstrated within this study, the remoteness of a site influences the observed plastic debris density and thus, the number of sites situated within urban or remote areas influences the national estimate. Further research is needed to identify efforts in accounting for differences in population density or debris source. For example, marine litter reporting by the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) segments coastlines by population density (i.e., urban to rural, HELCOM Baltic Sea) and reports the number of sites per class (González-Fernández and Hanke, 2020 ). Future guidance should consider strategies that enable representative estimates across a variety of country contexts, such as those with extensive remote coastlines and archipelagic countries. The use of plastic debris density estimates for SDG reporting usually requires collaboration with the NSO, as the mandated agency responsible for compiling an official statistic. Further research is needed to determine emerging partnerships between NSOs and the citizen science community, to identify key barriers and solutions for successful collaboration (see Fritz et al., 2019 ), drawing from existing experiences within Ghana, New Zealand and emergent initiatives globally. This includes a comprehensive understanding of both the needs and expectations of the NSO and citizen science community, and the perspectives of data contributors, including first-nations and local communities engaging with a national process.   6 Conclusion Reporting on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could be accelerated through engagement with the citizen science initiatives that collect and collate relevant data. Through a case study of the Australian Marine Debris Initiative (AMDI) Database, we demonstrate the ability for citizen science initiatives to support estimates of plastic debris density at the national and sub-national scale. The preliminary estimates identified large variation in debris density across years, where management actions could be informed by an understanding of sub-national trends over time. In particular, the study identified NRMs with high debris densities and further assessed patterns according to ‘remoteness,’ with major cities and remote areas as potential hotspots for debris. By enabling the compilation of the SDG Indicator on marine debris, and further disaggregating sub-nationally, countries can establish a reporting process that informs and evaluates policies at various scales. The baseline estimates can serve as a benchmark for monitoring the effectiveness of management strategies, identifying areas that require further intervention and supports risk assessments of plastic pollution. Collaborations between government agencies responsible for SDG reporting and the citizen science community requires several factors; clear communication, official recognition, and investment are essential. Experiences can be drawn from existing initiatives in Ghana and New Zealand, to demonstrate the potential of citizen science in contributing to official statistics and SDG reporting. Further research is needed to understand emerging partnerships between government agencies responsible for the SDGs and the citizen science community, identifying barriers and solutions for successful collaboration, which includes an understanding of the perspectives and expectations of both parties.
