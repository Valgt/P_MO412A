                  As environmental concerns and the energy crisis intensify, advancing the use of new energy sources such as wind and photovoltaic is an important means to achieve sustainable energy development. However, the random fluctuation characteristics and seasonality of wind and light make them difficult to predict, which brings many operational risks to grid security and power dispatch. Therefore, this paper uses the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) as the decomposition algorithm, which can effectively avoid the problems of modal confusion and noise residuals and better identify the trend, seasonality and nonlinear characteristics of the series. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is also utilized to improve the prediction accuracy and stability of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Combining CEEMDAN and PSO-ELM models, a high-precision hybrid forecasting system that can effectively reduce the effects of stochastic fluctuations is proposed. In this paper, wind speed data from four different seasons at Changma wind farm in China are selected to verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of this hybrid prediction system. The results show that the improvement of ELM by PSO and CEEMDAN significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the model, and the hybrid prediction system can be applied to time series with different data characteristics and variation patterns in each season, and its prediction accuracy and model performance are significantly better than other comparative models.

Hebei Key Laboratory of Physics and Energy Technology North China Electric Power University Box 205 Baoding Hebei 071003 PR China       As environmental concerns and the energy crisis intensify, advancing the use of new energy sources such as wind and photovoltaic is an important means to achieve sustainable energy development. However, the random fluctuation characteristics and seasonality of wind and light make them difficult to predict, which brings many operational risks to grid security and power dispatch. Therefore, this paper uses the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) as the decomposition algorithm, which can effectively avoid the problems of modal confusion and noise residuals and better identify the trend, seasonality and nonlinear characteristics of the series. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is also utilized to improve the prediction accuracy and stability of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Combining CEEMDAN and PSO-ELM models, a high-precision hybrid forecasting system that can effectively reduce the effects of stochastic fluctuations is proposed. In this paper, wind speed data from four different seasons at Changma wind farm in China are selected to verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of this hybrid prediction system. The results show that the improvement of ELM by PSO and CEEMDAN significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the model, and the hybrid prediction system can be applied to time series with different data characteristics and variation patterns in each season, and its prediction accuracy and model performance are significantly better than other comparative models.

At the same time, global energy prices have risen significantly and the energy crisis has intensified, which now highlights the need to accelerate the pace of energy transition, ensure energy security and improve conversion efficiency [3] . Despite the impact of the new crown epidemic over the past two years, global carbon emissions generally decrease across all regions in 2020, with global carbon emissions falling to 32.28 billion tons, down 6.3Â % year-on-year [4] . However, with the gradual recovery of the global epidemic and the relaxation of anti-epidemic policies, the economy and production slowly recovered, energy demand rebounded significantly, and coal-fired power generation in various countries rebounded strongly. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global carbon emissions from the energy sector will rise by 6Â % again in 2021, exceeding the level of carbon emissions before the outbreak and reaching a record high of 36.3 billion tons, making the global carbon reduction task a long way off [5] . In addition, the high pollution of traditional fossil energy sources also has a huge impact on the global ecological environment, and there is an urgent need for all mankind to solve the climate problem. In order to ensure sustainable development and maintain the earth's ecological environment, countries around the world are striving to explore new energy sources and achieve low-carbon environmental protection, which is a major issue [6] . Countries have proposed policies related to the development of new energy sources to optimize and restructure the energy structure, and some countries support the proposal to retire coal. For example, China has clearly put forward the goal of achieving âpeak carbonâ by 2030 and âcarbon neutralâ by 2060, the EU expects to achieve a net reduction of at least 55Â % in greenhouse gas emissions in 40Â years, and the US proposes to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 [7â8] . IEA's âElectricity Market Report 2022â report indicates that the global electricity market will increase the production of new energy power year by year from 2015 to 2022, and IEA forecasts that new energy will account for more than 80Â % of the increase in global electricity production in 2023 and 2024 (see Fig. 1  ) [9] . As an ideal form of energy with a huge output, clean and environmentally friendly, and sustainable access, wind energy has become the best application prospect and fastest growing new energy type, and is one of the key research projects for scholars to study new energy generation at present [10] . However, the natural properties of wind energy such as randomness and fluctuation make its wind speed series non-linear and non-smooth, which poses a greater challenge to power scheduling, grid security, storage and transmission, and power consumption, which is one of the reasons why wind power is difficult to be fully implemented and its price is high at present [11] . Therefore, in order to promote the development of the wind power industry and improve the utilization of energy, accurate wind speed prediction is very necessary. Better wind speed prediction accuracy enables the management to anticipate the risk caused by wind speed fluctuations to reduce the impact of wind power intermittency on grid stability and security, and at the same time, it can provide a reference for power dispatch, energy storage allocation, and turbine management to reduce the waste of wind energy resources [12â13] .  1.2 Literature review On the one hand, the wind speed series collected are different due to different weather conditions and geographical conditions, and on the other hand, the wind speed series are extremely uncertain and unstable, both of which lead to the difficulty of wind speed being accurately predicted [14] . Therefore, exploring wind speed series data processing methods and improving the accuracy of wind speed prediction models are key topics for scholars at home and abroad to study wind speed prediction. Wind speed prediction methods can be classified into three types: physical models, statistical models, and machine learning [15] . Numerical weather forecasting system (NWF) is the most common physical prediction model, which is mainly based on various meteorological factors such as humidity, temperature, wind direction, and pressure to predict the atmospheric state in the subsequent days, so as to infer the wind speed at the corresponding moment, but its disadvantage is that it is too dependent on external factors, more sensitive to errors, less robust and has limited applications [16] . For statistical prediction models, mainly reflected in linear models, such as auto regressive (AR) [17] , moving average (MA) [18] , auto regressive moving average (ARMA) [19] . But wind speed is strongly non-stationary and seasonal, and the prediction accuracy is often very poor using only statistical models. Therefore, the basic statistical calculation method is improved and auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) [20]  and Seasonal-ARIMA (SARIMA) [21]  with better prediction results are proposed. For example, Aasim et al. proposed the RWT-ARIMA short-term wind speed prediction model with high accuracy by fitting the data after repeated wavelet decomposition by using ARIMA [20] . Although it can be seen through the experiment that the improved statistical algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of the prediction, the generalization applicability of these models is poor. It is better for smoother wind speed prediction, but not as good for wind speed prediction with more volatile variability and extreme values. Nowadays, machine learning is also widely used in statistical prediction, mainly using supervised learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) [22â23] , random forests (RF) [24â25] , and various types of neural networks [26â32] . Among them, artificial neural network is a hot research area nowadays, and back propagation neural network (BP) [30] , extreme learning machine (ELM) [31] , radial basis function neural network (RBF) [32] , Elman neural network (Elman) [33] , and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) [27â29]  are common network architectures. But the single machine learning algorithm still has difficulty coping with unpredictable wind speeds, and the training results of most machine learning are random in nature, and the training effect is difficult to predict in advance. Meanwhile, for unprocessed raw complex sequences, neural network models are prone to problems such as overfitting, strong lag, and long training time, and most neural networks have strong dependence on parameters, but often the optimal parameters are not easily obtained once through training, and the prediction effect is not stable. Compared with a single prediction model, a hybrid prediction system that combines machine learning with other algorithms is more comprehensive in consideration, more stable in prediction, and better able to highlight the functions needed for a complete prediction system. Both the accuracy of prediction and the generalization ability of the model have been greatly improved, and are currently the focus of research in this research area [34] . It is common to combine data decomposition algorithms, optimization algorithms and machine learning. For example, Li et al. proposed a combined model that uses a bi-directional long-short memory network (Bi-LSTM) optimized by a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to predict typhoon data after variational modal decomposition (VMD) processing, and demonstrated experimentally that the combined VMD PSO-Bi-LSM model can accurately predict typhoons with high robustness [35] . Liu et al. combined empirical wavelet transform (EWT), gray wolf optimization algorithm (GWO), and regularized extreme learning machine (RELM) for prediction and used inverse empirical wavelet transform (IEWT) to reconstruct the prediction subsequence to obtain an intelligent wind speed prediction model with high prediction accuracy [36] .  1.3 Contributions of the paper The strong volatility of new energy data such as wind and light energy often requires the use of data decomposition methods to better identify sequence features. However, existing data decomposition methods often suffer from modal confounding, noise residuals, and strong parameter dependence. To this end, this paper introduces a new decomposition method, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) [37â39] , which can effectively deal with the added white noise and effectively separate for different modal frequency features, avoiding problems such as modal confounding that easily arise from traditional decomposition methods, and thus improving prediction accuracy. At the same time, the use of overly complex neural networks tends to cause slow convergence, which affects the practical application ability of conducting real-time prediction. Therefore, the ELM model with strong convergence and faster convergence speed is selected as the prediction model, while the parameters and thresholds of the ELM model are optimized using PSO to improve the prediction accuracy of the model and the robustness of the model training [40â41] . In this paper, the prediction accuracy and performance of a hybrid prediction system CEEMDAN-PSO-ELM based on data decomposition, algorithm optimization and artificial intelligence models are investigated. And based on wind speed data in different seasons, the case study is conducted with several other comparative models. This paper will introduce the theoretical basis based on this study, including CEEMDAN, ELM, and PSO, in the subsequent Section 2 ; the hybrid prediction system proposed in this paper is described in detail in Section 3 ; and in the experimental part of Section 4 , four sets of wind speed data in different seasons are selected for experiments considering seasonal factors, and the prediction effects of the model are judged in multiple aspects by combining different error indicators. Experiments prove that the hybrid prediction system has high prediction accuracy for every wind speed with different volatility in different seasons, and at the same time, the comparison with several comparative models demonstrates that each step of the improvements made in this paper is effective and feasible; finally, the study is concluded in Section 5 .   2 Theoretical model 2.1 Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise The commonly used modal decomposition methods include the empirical modal decomposition (EMD) [42â43] , the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) [44â46] , VMD [47â49]  and other methods. EMD is an adaptive decomposition algorithm that divides the series into a finite number of subsequences and a residual series based on the characteristics of the time series itself, which can effectively decompose various complex nonlinear series, but due to the lack of mathematical theory, the method is prone to problems such as modal confusion, endpoint effects, and over-decomposition [50] . EEMD is an optimization of EMD which adds qualified white noise to the EMD and obtains the components from each decomposition equally, which effectively avoids the phenomenon of modal confusion, but the added white noise itself tends to produce residuals, which affects the subsequent prediction [51] . Although VMD can artificially decide the number of decompositions and has a strong mathematical theoretical advantage to effectively avoid the over-decomposition problem, it requires the manual setting of multiple parameters of the variables and relies too much on the rational study of the different weights and accuracy of the parameters [52] . Therefore, in order to perform adaptive and effective decomposition of complex sequences while avoiding problems such as over-decomposition and noise residue, this paper introduces CEEMDAN, which is improved based on EEMD. EEMD is to decompose multiple sequences after adding white noise directly by using EMD, and then the mean value of the corresponding subsequence is used as the decomposition result; while the CEEMDAN method is to iterate EEMD several times, and the mean value of all components found in each iteration is used as the output of that iteration, and only one subsequence is found in each iteration, and then the white noise after EMD processing is added to the residuals to do the next iteration [53] . The method incorporates adaptive white noise, which has better completeness, effectively avoids the noise residual phenomenon, and can effectively reduce the appearance of low frequency components with very small amplitude. The specific principles are as follows: Step 1: First, add white noise Ï  i  t      obeying the standard normal distribution to the initial signal sequence y ( t )   , obtain a new sequence y  i  ( t )    , and perform EMD decomposition on the sequence at the same time, the first group of IMF components IM F 1  ( t )     is obtained by setting the mean function, and the rest of the signals are used as the residual sequence r 1  ( t )    .(1) y i  t  = y t  + Ï i  t        (2) IM F 1  t  = 1 I  â i = 1  I  I M F 1 i  t        (3) r 1  t  = y t  - I M F 1  t         In the formula, y  i  ( t )     is the sequence after adding white noise, Ï  i  ( t )     is white noise, and IM F 1  ( t )     is the first group of IMF components obtained. Step 2: Continue to add normally distributed white noise Ï  i  ( t )     to the remaining residual sequence r 1  ( t )     of the first group, and perform EMD decomposition on the reconstructed signal y  i  ( t )    , which is the same as Step 1, reserved the newly obtained first group of IMF components is used as the second IMF component IM F 2  ( t )     of the whole group of original signals, while the remaining components are used as a new residual sequence r 2  ( t )    .(4) IM F 2  t  = 1 I  â i = 1  I  I M F 2 i  t         Step 3: Repeat Step 1 for the newly obtained residual sequence, and continuously obtain new IMF components IM F n  ( t )     and residual sequence r n  ( t )    .(5) r n  t  = r n - 1   t  - IMF n  t         Step 4: Continue to perform the above steps until the remaining sequence cannot be decomposed, and the decomposition ends, thereby obtaining a new set of IMF components IM F 1  t   , I M F 2  t   , â¯ , I M F n  ( t )     and the corresponding residual sequence r n  ( t )    . The algorithm flow chart of CEEMDAN is shown in Fig. 2  .  2.2 Introduction to predictive models 2.2.1 Extreme learning machine Compared with the traditional neural network model, the extreme learning machine model has less parameter settings, fast convergence speed and strong generalization ability. It only needs to set the nodes of the hidden layer [54] . It has strong fitting ability to nonlinear data and is suitable for handling highly volatile wind speed data. Therefore, this paper adopts the extreme learning machine model for prediction [55] . Step 1: First set the model parameters, the number of neurons in the input layer is N  , there are K   neurons in the hidden layer, and there are Q   neurons in the output layer, and the input vector is z j  = [ z j 1   , z j 2   , . . . , z jn   ]  T    , then the output formula of the extreme learning machine is:(6) y j  = â i = 1  K  Î² i  g ( w i  z j  + b i  )       In the formula, Î² i    is the weight, b i    is the hidden layer threshold, g ( x )    is the activation function, and w i    is the connection weight vector. Step 2: The matrix form of formula (6)  can be expressed as:(7) H Î² = Y          In the formula, the output matrix H   of the hidden layer, and the expected output is Y  . Step 3: Î²   is the weight matrix of output layer:(8) Î² = H +  Y        In the formula, H  +    is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the matrix  H   .  2.2.2 Particle swarm optimization The particle swarm optimization algorithm is a swarm optimization algorithm that simulates the foraging behavior of birds in nature. Due to its rapid convergence, easy implementation, and small parameter restrictions, it has become the most widely used swarm intelligence optimization algorithm [56â57] . The prominent feature of PSO is to use the collective intelligence and memory of the population to conduct a collaborative search through location and information sharing, so as to find the global optimal solution of the objective function in the solution space (see Fig. 3  ). The algorithm frame of the whole particle swarm optimization algorithm is as follows [58â59] : Step 1: Randomly initialize the initial position initialization method of each particle in the particle swarm, and then calculate the fitness function of each individual according to the adaptive function (generally the objective function),so as to select the individual's historical local optimal position Pbest  i    and the population's historical global optimal position vector Gbest   . Step 2: Update the speed Y i    and position vector X i    of each individual according to formula (9) ;(9) Y i  = Ï Y i  + c 1  r 1  Pbest i  - Y i    + c 2  r 2  G b e s t - Y i      X i  = X i  + Y i             Among them, i = 1 , 2  , â¯ , n   , n   represents the total number of particles in the population, r   is a random number between 0 , 1     , c   is the learning factor, and Ï   is the inertia factor. Step 3: Update the Pbest  i    of each individual and the Gbest    of the population by comparing the fitness functions; Step 4: Determine whether the number of iterations reaches the maximum function or the accuracy meets the set requirements. If so, output Gbest   ; otherwise, continue to iterate and jump to Step 2.  2.2.3 ELM optimization by particle swarm algorithm Although the ELM parameter settings are few, its initial weights and thresholds are randomly generated, which can easily cause instability to the prediction model. Therefore, this paper selects the particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the ELM model. The steps are as follows: Step 1: First normalize the initial data to facilitate subsequent calculations. Step 2: Set the parameters of each layer of the ELM model and the number of nodes, initialize the weights and thresholds, and use the RMSE of the model as the fitness function for algorithm optimization. Step 3: Continuously iteratively optimize the individual and all particles, and screen according to the fitness function. Step 4: When the maximum number of iterations is reached or the error meets the requirements, the optimization of the algorithm is completed, the position vector after PSO optimization is taken out, and the weights and thresholds are put into the ELM model for subsequent prediction.    3 Integrated forecasting model In this paper, the CEEMDAN method is selected as the data decomposition method, which can effectively avoid the occurrence of modal aliasing, and can also well separate white noise. At the same time, based on the problem of slow convergence speed of commonly used neural networks in the past, this paper uses the particle swarm optimization ELM model to predict the components of different frequency bands based on wind speed decomposition, and finally performs combined to obtain the final point prediction model of this paper. The prediction steps are as follows: Step 1: Dividing the original data into a training set and a testing set. Step 2: Data decomposition of the training set by CEEMDAN to obtain n   components with different frequency bands. Step 3: The initial weights and thresholds of ELM are optimized using PSO according to the data features of different components, and the optimized parameters are used as the initial parameters. Step 4: Prediction of each component using PSO-ELM to obtain the prediction subsequence of each component. Step 5: The predicted values of each component are summed up to obtain the point prediction results. Step 6: The predicted values are compared with the testing set, and the prediction accuracy of the hybrid system is judged by the error evaluation index. According to the steps of this hybrid system, we can get the flow chart of this prediction model, as in Fig. 4  .  4 Multi-season wind speed forecast 4.1 Analysis of data To better evaluate the performance of the prediction model proposed in this paper, historical wind speed data from a single-machine 2160 unit of the Changma wind farm in China in 2016 were selected for the experiments. To verify that the model can be applied to wind speed prediction in each season, we select the data from the first five days of each month in March, June, September, and December of this wind turbine as the validation data set, where the time interval between each two adjacent data points is 5Â min, with a total of 1440 sets of data. In order to better discuss the differences in wind speed between seasons, we analyzed each data set using four statistical features: range, average, variance, and fuzzy entropy [60] . As shown in Fig. 5  , blue represents the wind speed at the beginning of March, orange represents the wind speed at the beginning of June, green represents the wind speed at the beginning of September, and pink represents the wind speed at the beginning of December. From Table 1  , we can see that the wind speed in early June and early September has the largest fluctuation range, 14.43Â m/s and 12.64Â m/s respectively, and the wind speed in these two months has a higher degree of complexity as shown by the fuzzy entropy. The wind speed in early December has the lowest complexity but the largest degree of deviation. The wind speed in early March has the smallest overall average wind speed, and the deviation and complexity of the time series are small and relatively flat. It can be seen that the overall fluctuation range of wind speed is between [2Â m/s, 12Â m/s], and the degree of wind speed fluctuation varies from month to month, and the change trend is also very different, but they all have strong randomness and aperiodicity, which makes prediction difficult.  4.2 Data preprocessing In this paper, the wind speed in different months is preprocessed, and the data is decomposed. The CEEMDAN method is used, the number of noise additions is set to 500 times, the maximum number of iterations is 5000 times, and the standard deviation of Gaussian white noise is set to 0.2. As can be seen from Fig. 6  , after CEEMDAN decomposition, the Changma data set in early March, early June, and early December are divided into 10 IMFs components, and the Changma data set in early September is divided into 11 IMFs components. For different components, put them into the prediction model in turn for prediction.  4.3 Prediction results and error analysis In this paper, the first 1344 groups of the data set are used as the training set and the last 96 groups are used as the testing set. The hidden layer nodes of the ELM model network are set to 20 and the transfer function was set to Sine function. The training set data were put into the CEEMDAN-PSO-ELM model as known wind speed data to predict the subsequent 96 groups and compared with the prediction results of the BP model, Elman model, LSTM model, ELM model, PSO-ELM model and CEEMDAN-ELM model and the true values of the testing set. In this paper, we will give the prediction graphs of each model and evaluate the accuracy of the prediction results by three error evaluation indicators, which are the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) [61] . As can be seen from Fig. 7  , the black curve represents the actual wind speed, the blue dashed line is the prediction result of the BP model, the yellow curve is the prediction result of the Elman model, the purple curve is the prediction result of the LSTM model, the green curve is the prediction result of the ELM model, the red curve is the prediction result of the PSO-ELM model, the pink curve is the prediction result of the CEEMDAN-ELM model and the bright cyan curve is the prediction result of the CEEMDAN-PSO-ELM model proposed in this paper. The error values obtained for the seven compared models based on MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are given in Table 2  . To make the comparison more intuitive, Fig. 8   shows the error visualization comparison graphs for the different models. From this we can obtain the following information.(1) For the four single neural network models, the prediction accuracy of ELM is significantly higher than that of BP and Elman in any data set, and the MAPE values of ELM are reduced by 6Â %â22Â % compared to BP and Elman. The difference in MAE, MAPE and RMSE between ELM and LSTM is not significant. Taking MAPE as an example, LSTM predicts slightly better than ELM in March, September and December, with MAPE values reduced by 3.97Â %, 3.04Â % and 1.96Â % respectively, while ELM predicts stronger than LSTM in June, with MAPE values reduced by 2.34Â %. Overall, the LSTM is slightly better than the ELM in terms of prediction, but for the same dataset, due to the shortcomings of the LSTM's inability to process in parallel and its complex structure, the LSTM takes about 30Â s to run, while the ELM model only takes about 0.007Â s, the running cost of the LSTM is much higher than that of the ELM. And when LSTM is combined with CEEMDAN and PSO, the running time of the combined model is about 20Â min, far beyond the time interval (5Â min) between two adjacent samples, which is less practical to use. At the same time, LSTM requires more training parameters to be set in advance while the best parameters are often difficult to obtain, whereas ELM only requires the number of hidden layer nodes and the transfer function to be determined in advance. Therefore, all things considered, the ELM model has better utility and timeliness than other neural network models.  (2) For these four early-month data sets from different seasons in the Changma data set, the error values of the CEEMDAN-PSO-ELM model proposed in this paper are the smallest for each error evaluation index. Taking MAPE as an example, the prediction errors of the CEEMDAN-PSO-ELM model are 2.7074Â %, 2.4299Â %, 2.5976Â %, and 2.7702Â % in the data sets of early March, early June, early September, and early December, respectively. In contrast, these errors are 18.2372Â %, 8.8742Â %, 11.6914Â %, and 11.1103Â % in the single ELM model. Compared to the ELM model, the CEEMDAN-PSO-ELM model decreases the MAPE values by 85.15Â %, 72.62Â %, 77.78Â %, and 75.07Â % on the four data sets, respectively. Even compared to the already better predicted CEEMDAN-ELM model, the target model is still 72.36Â %, 23.99Â %, 44.77Â %, and 29.50Â % decreases. At the same time, they both meet the current short-term wind speed prediction error tolerance with high accuracy, indicating that the hybrid prediction system proposed in this paper is relatively accurate for the prediction of new energy time series.  (3) In this paper, we use the progressive comparison model and find that the PSO-ELM model has better prediction accuracy than the common ELM model through four months of data comparison, and the errors of all three indicators are reduced to a greater extent, which indicates that the PSO algorithm is effective in optimizing the ELM model. Compared with the ELM model and the PSO-ELM model, the error indicator values of the CEEMDAN-ELM model continue to decrease, indicating that the CEEMDAN method used in this paper can effectively avoid the occurrence of modal confusion and improve the prediction accuracy.  (4) Compared with the single ELM model, the improvement in prediction accuracy of the PSO-ELM model is smaller than that of the CEEMDAN-ELM model, indicating that the improvement of the ELM by CEEMDAN is better than that by PSO. But the improvement of prediction accuracy by acting PSO and CEEMDAN simultaneously on ELM is much higher than that by acting both only separately on ELM, indicating that each step of the improvement of the target model proposed in this paper is effective.    In order to make the experimental results more convincing and avoid biased results due to chance, we compare the prediction performance of the four models (ELM model, PSO-ELM model, CEEMDAN-ELM model and CEEMDAN-PSO-ELM model) using Monte Carlo sampling method [62] . For the four datasets in this paper, we set each data patch as 1000 in each iteration, and iterate 10 times in total. The mean value of RMSE of each data set for 10 iterations was used as the error evaluation index of prediction accuracy. The results are shown in Table 3  . As can be seen from Table 3 , for the average prediction error RMSE after 10 iterations, CEEMDAN-PSO-ELM is the smallest for all four data sets and has 85.87Â %, 70.98Â %, 75.57Â % and 76.43Â % reduction relative to the ELM model, respectively. The prediction results of this multiple iterations are the same as the single iteration, which more strongly proves the superiority and the robustness of the prediction performance of the hybrid prediction system proposed in this paper.  4.4 Analysis of improvement methods It is known from experience that the EMD method is prone to modal aliasing. The VMD method requires manual setting of the number of modes and penalty factors, the decomposition effect is more influenced by the hyperparameters and prone to errors. The CEEMDAN method can adaptively decompose the added white noise to better extract the modalities. In order to better discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the prediction models proposed in this paper, CEEMDAN is compared with EMD, VMD and Optimized VMD (OVMD) in this paper, and three new comparative prediction models are developed, namely EMD-PSO-ELM, VMD-PSO-ELM and OVMD-PSO-ELM models. By comparing the error indicators of the four hybrid models, the stability of the model proposed in this paper is further analyzed. In this paper, the modal number of the four EMD models is 11, and other parameters are set in the same way as the CEEMDAN method. The VMD modal number is 5 by default. The optimal modal number and penalty factor for OVMD are determined by the energy entropy. Fig. 9   shows the MAPE values of the four models for the Changma wind farm. From Fig. 9 , it can be seen that the accuracy of the EMD-PSO-ELM model is relatively poor, and although the accuracy of the VMD-PSO-ELM and OVMD-PSO-ELM are better, the MAPE values of the model proposed in this paper are still smaller than theirs. OVMD-PSO-ELM predicts better than VMD-PSO-ELM on the March and December datasets, but less well on the June and September datasets. It shows that OVMD is more influenced by the dataset and the stability of the decomposition is less. Table 4   shows the MAE, MAPE and RMSE results of the four hybrid models. As can be seen from Table 4 , all four hybrid models have good prediction results, but the model proposed in this paper has significantly better results than the other three sets of hybrid models regardless of which month's dataset is used. Comparing with EMD-PSO-ELM, MAPE is reduced by 72.22Â %, 30.09Â %, 36.28Â % and 51.38Â %; comparing with VMD-PSO-ELM, MAPE is reduced by 57.18Â %, 13.21Â %, 19.83Â % and 31.13Â %; comparing with OVMD-PSO-ELM, MAPE is reduced by 50.60Â %, 22.94Â %, 24.98Â % and 9.25Â %, which further confirms the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper. Meanwhile, the model of this paper was tested by Matlab 2021b, and there were four sets of test data with 96 points in each set, and the total prediction time was 227Â s, which was a short overall time, indicating that this hybrid prediction system performs prediction with a fast convergence rate and meets the requirements of short-term wind speed prediction.   5 Conclusions and discussion In recent years, countries around the world have attached great importance to the goal of achieving sustainable energy development, and the pace of achieving a clean transition of energy systems has become increasingly urgent. However, the uncertainty of new energy sources such as wind and light can pose a challenge to the security, storage, and transmission of power grids [63] . Therefore, it is quite important to predict the changes of energy time series in advance, but it is often difficult for a single model to achieve the required accuracy [64] . In this paper, CEEMDAN is used to decompose the original data into a series of high-frequency to low-frequency components, so as to extract the trends, seasonal effects, and fluctuation characteristics in the complex series. The parameters and thresholds of the ELM model are then optimized by PSO to make the prediction performance of ELM more robust. The PSO-ELM model is used to predict each component, and finally the predicted values of each component are summed and reconstructed to obtain the final prediction results, and an efficient hybrid prediction system is constructed. Considering that wind speed in different seasons has different variation characteristics, in order to verify that the hybrid prediction system proposed in this paper has good generalization ability and can predict the data for the whole year. In this paper, four sets of wind speed data from different seasons are used for experimental verification, and the conclusions are as follows:(1) Through progressive comparison methods and Monte Carlo sampling experiments, it is demonstrated that the hybrid forecasting system CEEMDAN-PSO-ELM constructed in this paper based on data decomposition, algorithm optimization and artificial intelligence model can effectively forecast series with different volatility characteristics throughout the year, and is much higher than other models in terms of forecasting accuracy and model robustness.  (2) Optimizing the ELM model using PSO can improve the prediction accuracy and stability of the forecast model. PSO-ELM model not only has strong convergence, but also converges quickly and meets the requirements of short-term wind speed prediction. Although the improvement of ELM by CEEMDAN is better than that of PSO, combining both with ELM can make the prediction better, which proves that each step of the improvement proposed in this paper is effective.  (3) Comparison with EMD, VMD and OVMD shows that CEEMDAN is more efficient and stable for decomposition of complex wind speed series, allowing more accurate modal identification. CEEMDAN not only avoids the modal confounding problem of EMD, but is also more stable for the decomposition of different data sets, unlike VMD and OVMD, which are dependent on the choice of hyperparameters.    In the subsequent research work, we will consider further improvement of the decomposition algorithm to reduce the problems of information loss, over-decomposition, and modal confusion. At the same time, we try to combine the hybrid prediction system with more machine learning and statistical methods to find the most suitable combination form, and explore how to improve the convergence speed of the optimization algorithm to search for the optimal solution and avoid the local optimum problem. We will continue to deepen our research in this field and devote ourselves to improving the prediction performance, operational efficiency and generalization ability of hybrid prediction systems.
