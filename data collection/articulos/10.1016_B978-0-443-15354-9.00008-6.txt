               The quality of water is significant for human health; it is greatly influenced by noxious pollutants such as heavy metals, organic impurities including dyes (Cationic and Anionic), Persistent Organic Pollutants, antibiotics, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, microplastics, etc. In addition, pathogen-contaminated (microbial load) water also plays a significant role in deciphering water quality status and its impact on human health. The present book chapter covers different impurities in the context of aquatic ecosystems and will provide a detailed overview of the toxic effect of these impurities on human health and animals. The details provided herein will not only cater to the need of the hour in terms of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); namely SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well Being), SDGs 6 (Clean water and Sanitation), and SDGs 14 (Life below water) but it will also provide a significant database to the potential stakeholders nationally as well as internationally for policy formations and amendments.

The present book chapter covers different impurities in the context of aquatic ecosystems and will provide a detailed overview of the toxic effect of these impurities on human health and animals. The details provided herein will not only cater to the need of the hour in terms of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); namely SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well Being), SDGs 6 (Clean water and Sanitation), and SDGs 14 (Life below water) but it will also provide a significant database to the potential stakeholders nationally as well as internationally for policy formations and amendments.

These pollutants pose a serious threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems and humans.13   The detailed classification of dyes can be better understood from Fig. 2.2  . POPs are generally categorized in three: (1) pesticides that include Aldrin, Chlordane, Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), Dieldrin, Endrin, Heptachlor, Hexachlorobenzene (HCBs), Mirex, Toxaphene; (2) Industrial chemicals include Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and HCBs; (3) by-products including polychlorinated dibenzo-p -dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), and PCBs (http://chm.pops.int/TheConvention/ThePOPs/The12InitialPOPs/tabid/296/Default.aspx ). Furthermore, under Stockholm Convention, certain chemical pollutants such as Alpha hexachlorocyclohexane, Beta hexachlorocyclohexane, Chlordecone, Dicofol, Lindane, Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid (PFOS),  Perfluorooctane Sulfonyl Fluoride (PFOSF), etc., were recently introduced under the category of new POPs (Fig. 2.3  ) (http://chm.pops.int/TheConvention/ThePOPs/TheNewPOPs/tabid/2511/Default.aspx ). POPs are considered as one of the major cause of environmental pollution through different day to day operational activities such as agriculture, polluted outcomes from industries and residential societies.15   Antibiotics have been extensively used daily to treat several bacterial infections and other severe ailments. After introducing antibiotics to the aquatic ecosystem through hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and others Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), antibiotics are generated by potentially resistant bacteria and Antibiotics-Resistantance Genes (ARGs).16   The classes of different antibiotics can be better understood from Fig. 2.4  . EDCs are external agents that alter the natural endocrine cycle, thereby affecting the synthesis, secretion, transport, and binding of the hormones responsible for essential body activities such as reproduction, growth, development, etc.18   In the year 1998, USEPA established the endocrine disruptor screening program (EDSP) with the goal of identification of chemical compounds playing a vital role in the disruption of the endocrine system.19   Literary evidence suggests that exposure to EDCs may cause health issues such as infertility, thyroid dysfunction, and hormonal imbalances, etc.20   Excessive usage of plastic items across the globe and their nonregularized disposal in the environment results in severe detrimental impacts on aquatic fauna and humans8   thereby, it is characterized as one of the  emerging pollutants. Due to their properties such as nonbiodegradable nature, high shelf life, and resistance towards physical abrasion, these pollutants persist in the environment for ages in different sizes varying from 0.2–20 cm (macro-size plastics), 2000–200 µm (meso-size plastics), 200–20 µm (micro-size plastics), and 20–2 µm (nano-size plastics).21    Considering the above, in the present book chapter, we made an effort to document the different sources of water pollution, such as heavy metals, dyes, POPs, antibiotics, EDCs, MPs, pathogens contaminated water, etc., along with their implications on the aquatic fauna and human health. In addition, an effort has been made to correlate these noxious environmental contaminants’ current context with SDGs, namely SDG 3, 6, and 14.  2.2 Sources of water pollution Factors including rapid urbanization, industrialization, anthropogenic activities, and natural disasters (Fig. 2.5  ) are some of the examples that are generally responsible for polluting the aquatic ecosystem.9–20   Thus, enhancing these activities for better economic development enhances the polluted aquatic system through polluting agents such as heavy metals, dyes, POPs, antibiotics, EDCs, MPs, pathogens, etc. These noxious pollutants get introduced into the aquatic ecosystem through several activities. For example, activities such as volcanic eruption, forest fires, natural rocks, sea spray, aerosol, mining industries, combustion, excessive use of fertilizers, electroplating, and thermal power plants are some of the significant sources responsible for the heavy metals pollution in the aquatic ecosystem22   (Fig. 2.6  ). The major source for dyes pollution in an aquatic ecosystem is the untreated textile effluents, fibers and plastic industries that contain synthetic dyes widely used for different day to day applications.13    POPs are introduced into the aquatic ecosystem either through natural sources, that is, volcanic eruptions and forest fires or anthropogenic sources, that is, chemical industries (PCBs, HCBs, brominated compounds, Per- and Polyfluorinated Substances (PFAS), etc.), industrial   by-products (Dioxins and Furans), agricultural activities, that is, use of pesticides (DDT, aldrin, endrin, chlordane, mirex, etc.)23   Moreover, EDCs were introduced into the aquatic ecosystem through industrial, agricultural, animal, and human waste (considering naturally excreted hormones, veterinary drugs, sewage and sludge, fertilizers, etc.) and other sources comprising surface runoffs, anthropogenic activities, and natural depositions.24   Among them, sewage is considered the primary source (70%) responsible for introducing EDCs into the aquatic ecosystem.7,25   Different sources of EDCs and their impact on the aquatic fauna can be better understood from Fig. 2.7  . MPs were introduced into the aquatic ecosystem through different sources such as WWTPs,26   stormwater runoffs,27   atmospheric depositions, discarded plastics from polymeric industries, fabrics, personal care products, etc.26–28   Moreover, Fig. 2.8  clearly indicates the various sources of MPs pollution and their mode of transportation to aquatic ecosystems. Sources such as domestic misuse, effluent treatment plants (ETPs) of pharmaceutical industries, hospital wastes, and WWTPs are some of the  significant contributors responsible for introducing antibiotics and ARGs into the aquatic ecosystem.29,30   Recently, the COVID-19 outbreak is also considered one of the major contributors to this pollution in the nearby aquatic streams.31–33   Different sources of antibiotics and ARGs and their fate in aquatic ecosystems can be better understood from Fig. 2.9  .  2.3 Health implication of noxious environmental contaminants 2.3.1 Health implications dues to Heavy metals Due to their nonbiodegradable nature, heavy metals act as one of the most potential stressors to pollute aquatic ecosystems and accumulate into different food chain trophic levels.34   For a long, heavy metals have been known for their detrimental effect on human health, such as central nervous disorders, carcinogenic activities, renal failures, respiratory disorders, etc.34   The health implications of heavy metals on human health and aquatic ecosystems can be better understood from Fig. 2.10  .  Exposure to heavy metals above the permissible limits results in toxic implications such as exposure to As(III) and As(V) induces oxidative stress and alters physio-metabolic activities in aquatic animals35   while in humans, it causes pulmonary, cardiac, intestinal, respiratory, renal, and neurological disorders.36   Further, Cadmium (Cd) is known for causing metabolic, tissue, and hepatic disorders in aquatic animals,45,46   while in humans, it is responsible for carcinogenic activity and renal and pulmonary disorders.44,47   Chromium (Cr) in aquatic animals is responsible for impaired respiration and cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in vital organs such as the kidney, liver, spleen, etc., due to its properties of bioaccumulation 51   while it may lead to renal failure, intestinal ulcers, respiratory disorders, and lung cancer in humans.48,52   High exposure to Copper (Cu) in aquatic animals results in oxidative stress, enzymatic inhibitions, etc.55   while in humans, it causes damage to  the central nervous system (CNS), Wilson’s disease, Alzheimer's, etc.56   Furthermore, exposure to Lead (Pb) and Mercury (Hg) in aquatic animal’s causes neurotoxic, immunotoxic nephrotoxic impact, etc. and reduced fertility rate, vital organs damage such as liver, kidney, etc., respectively.59,60,64,65   In humans, high exposure to Pb is responsible for bone damage, is neurotoxic, and alters reproductive and renal systems. In addition, it is categorized as one of the probable carcinogens58,61   while exposure of Hg above is the permissible limit and is well known for carcinogenic action and severe health implications in terms of organ damage such as kidneys, lungs, skin, etc.66,67   To elucidate the health implication of heavy metals, a tabular presentation (Table 2.1  ) carrying details about the different prevailing ionic forms, natural and industrial sources, along with the detrimental impact on aquatic animals and human health. In addition to this, the permissible limits of different heavy metals in drinking water according to agencies such as WHO,86   HC Canada,87   USEPA,88   EU89  , and China90   were included in the table for a better understanding of the reader (Table 2.2  ).  2.3.2 Health implications dues to dyes Dyeing effluents pose a severe detrimental impact on aquatic fauna as well as human health.91   Ghaedi et al. confirmed the fact that high concentration of dyes in aquatic ecosystems results in the depletion of dissolved oxygen, thereby resulting in a low photosynthetic rate and     hampered biological activity of aquatic fauna.92   Furthermore, in fishes and aquatic fauna, these dyeing effluents lead to malfunctions in vital organs such as gills, tissue cells, renal, gut, and hepatic disorders, hampered growth rate, etc. (Fig. 2.11  ).93–95   In humans, these dyeing effluents were known for causing severe health impairments such as carcinogenic action (hepatocarcinoma, bladder cancer, etc.), nervous system malfunctioning, that is, intracellular enzyme inhibition, skin allergies, mutagenic effects, respiratory disorders, and impaired reproductive system (Fig. 2.12  ).96–98    2.3.3 Health implications due to persistent organic pollutants POPs are highly toxic in nature, and chronic exposure to this noxious pollutant, even in low concentration, results in a severely detrimental impact on aquatic fauna as well as human health99,100   (Fig. 2.13  , and Table 2.3  ). POPs such as Aldrin, Chlordane, Dieldrin were known as  probable carcinogenic agents and lead to health issues such as motor convulsion, gastrointestinal tract (GIT), renal damage, breast cancer, reproductive and nervous disorders, Parkinson’s disease, etc.101,102   Furthermore, endrin exposure leads to severe issues in the CNS thereby turning to death and pulmonary edema.103   On the other hand, heptachlor and HCBs, toxaphene were classified as probable carcinogens and responsible for human health implications such as liver and lung damage, CNS injury, reproductive and renal injuries, bronchial carcinoma, etc.104,105,107   A detailed list of POPs and their classification as carcinogen along with severe detrimental impact on human health was presented in Table 2.3 .  2.3.4 Health implications due to endocrine-disrupting chemicals EDCs such as phthalates, 17α-Ethinylestradiol, Bisphenol A, Diethylstilbestrol, Nonylphenol, and 17β estradiol were responsible for hampering the metabolism of the organism in the aquatic ecosystem, thereby causing reproductive toxicity, infertility, high mortality rates in juveniles, hermaphroditism, etc.120–123   Furthermore, EDCs such as flame retardants, Perfluorinated chemicals, triclosan, dibenzofuran, paraben leads to hormonal misbalances thereby disrupting the signaling and     synthesis of hormones (estrogenic and thyroid), altered sex ratio, degenerative fetal growth, carcinogenic activity, etc.120–123   Moreover, DDT is responsible for altering the CNS and immune system of the individual.120–123   Detailed health implications of EDCs on aquatic ecosystems can be better understood from Table 2.4  .  2.3.5 Health implications due to microplastics MPs have a detrimental impact on aquatic fauna as well as human health (Fig. 2.14  ).8   In the deep-sea environment, MPs get ingested by 87% zooplanktons,124   48% invertebrates,125   while in mussels, they get bio accumulated rather than ingested.126   On entering the marine ecosystem, MPs get transported to different organs, such as fish gills, liver, brain, etc., via the bloodstream and accumulate, thereby altering the different trophic levels.127   Furthermore, it was observed that in mussels, MPs alter the metabolism rate, thereby inducing oxidative stress, nerve dysfunctioning, hormonal misbalances, etc.128   From marine to freshwater ecosystems, similar health implications were observed, such as oxidative stress, endocrine disruptions, and immune injury.129,130   In addition, it also induces compound toxicity and offspring toxicity in freshwater animals.131     MPs, due to widespread dissemination, were also observed in tap water and bottled water, which are the major sources of drinking.132   These MPs get ingested and inhaled by human beings and lead to issues such as respiratory disorders, cardiovascular issues, and lung cancer.132     2.3.6 Health implications due to antibiotics and antibiotic-resistantance genes The presence of antibiotics in aquatic ecosystems is of great concern as it will promote the growth of antibiotic-resistant pathogens through genetic altercations, thereby increasing the health risk. Furthermore, these antibiotic-resistant pathogens and ARGs get transferred through horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) from one organism to another. WHO confirmed that the presence of ARGs in aquatic ecosystem pose serious health implications for animals and humans.133   The toxicity studies of these antibiotics confirmed negative effects on developmental growth, reproduction, fetal malformation, decreased gestational age, and mortality rate.134–137    2.3.7 Health implications due to pathogenic contaminated water The presence of pathogens in water results in severe detrimental health issues such as meningitis, encephalitis, cholera, GIT infection, etc., and may sometimes lead to death.138   Virus groups present in aquatic ecosystems through wastewater such as Adenovirus is known for causing lower and upper respiratory tract infections; Coxsackievirus is known for causing pharyngitis and the common cold; enterovirus and reovirus are known for causing gastroenteritis along with lower and upper respiratory tract infections; HIV is known for causing auto-immune disorders; influenza for causing flu; Norwalk and Rotavirus known for causing gastroenteritis; last but not the least Poliovirus is known for causing poliomyelitis.138   On the other hand, the presence of bacterial pathogens in the aquatic ecosystems, such as Actinomyces israelii  is known for causing Actinomycosis; Bacillus anthracis  for causing Anthrax; Brucella  spp. for causing Brucellosis (Malta fever); Campylobacter jejuni  for causing gastroenteritis; Clostridium  spp. for gas gangrene; Escherichia Coli  for causing diarrhea and gastroenteritis; Francisella tularensis  for causing tularemia, etc.138     2.4 Correlation with Sustainable Development Goals The work presented in this chapter is directly correlated to three SDGs, namely SDG 3, Good Health and Well-Being; SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 14: Life below Water.  2.4.1 Sustainable Development Goal 3 The recent COVID-19 outbreak infected 500 million people worldwide and led to approximately 15 million deaths. Furthermore, it decreases the global life expectancy ratio and enhances ill effects such as anxiety and depression (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3 ). Several studies across the globe have been carried out for the surveillance of COVID-19 through wastewater into nearby aquatic streams and from one country to another.140   In addition to this, as discussed above, other impurities such as heavy metals, dyes, POPs, EDCs, MPs, and pathogens pose a severe detrimental impact on human as well as animal health. Thus, it is the need of the hour that some strict international policies must be introduced to cope with these health implications.  2.4.2 Sustainable Development Goal 6 Due to a lack of proper monitoring facilities, the quality of water ~ 3 billion people were drinking is unknown. Due to exponential economic developments across the globe, the aquatic ecosystem is degraded at alarming rates; over the past 300 years, ~85% of the wetlands have been lost (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6 ). These natural and manmade sources get contaminated by different pollutants, as discussed above, and these pollutants, once entering the food chain, get bioaccumulated and result in potential health risks.  2.4.3 Sustainable Development Goal 14 Factors such as plastic waste, global warming, eutrophication, acidification, and overfishing result in the degradation of oceans and marine ecosystems day by day thereby threatening marine life (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14 ). Approximately 17+ million metric tons of plastic were littered into the oceans across the globe (https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14 ). Although MPs is one of the major pollutants for the marine ecosystem impurities, as discussed above, also play a crucial role in posing serious health impact on marine fauna as well as humans.   2.5 Conclusion Based on the compiled literature, it can be concluded that sources such as natural, industrial (ETPs/STPs), and anthropogenic activities are some of the major contributors towards the pollution of aquatic ecosystems. The impurities discussed herein have a serious detrimental impact on aquatic fauna as well as human health, thereby altering the  overall development of the organism. Further, it can be concluded that progressing in terms of economic development (exponential industrialization and urbanization) is one of the major reasons for the degradation of aquatic resources across the globe. Keeping in view the findings of the present chapter, some strict international policies must be introduced to cope up with these health implications.
