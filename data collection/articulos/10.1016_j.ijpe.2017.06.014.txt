The name of the conference, “Operational Excellence towards Sustainable Development Goals through Industry 4.0”, integrates two concepts that have emerged recently, imposing new challenges for both researchers and practitioners in the field of Production and Operations Management Research. The first one is the Sustainable Development Goals, a United Nations initiative that sets a number of objectives within the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, covering key areas for the future of the World. Production is in goal 12 but it cuts across several other goals, and plays an important overall role. The second one is the Industry 4.0, also known as the 4th Industrial Revolution, a new approach to organize the factory, characterized by the use of a set of digital technologies, which can support the roadmap towards a sustainable future. The conference had nearly three hundred (300) contributions, with presenters from twenty-nine (29) different countries. 31 authors were invited to submit an extended version of their papers to be considered for publication in the Special Issue, 24 accepted the invitation and after a rigorous review process, 14 papers were finally accepted. The selected papers address a variety of topics within Production Research, all of them making a contribution to the achievement of excellence in the operations of the organizations. The improvement of facilities is present in the papers by Zülch and Zülch (2017) , Vitayasak et al. (2017)  and Bortolini et al. (2017) . The first paper proposes an approach to evaluate U-shaped assembly systems that includes the ergonomics perspective as well as the usual logistics and cost criteria. The second one addresses the facility layout problem when the demand is stochastic. In this case, the layout may be reconfigured, but a trade-off between material flow improvements and reorganization costs appears. The authors propose a modified Backtracking Search Algorithms to solve this situation. The third paper shows a bi-objective model to minimize both the travel time and the energy required by the cranes to storage/retrieve the unit-loads of a warehouse. Scheduling is present in the papers by Borges de Sampaio et al. (2017) , and Morikawa and Takahashi (2017) . The first contribution proposes a linear programming model coupled with clearing functions to solve a production planning problem under a rolling horizon scheme. A clearing function is included in order to take into account that there is not a linear function between production throughput and cycle times and workload. They also propose a method to solve the resulting model. The second contribution addresses the problem of scheduling walks-in for hospitals in Japan. The proposed method shows a better performance than the current fix static method that allocates a fixed number of time slots to walk-ins in each attention box in advance. A number of topics in supply chain management are covered in the papers by Sy (2017) , Wu et al. (2017) , Guarnaschelli et al. (2017)  and Gan et al. (2017) . The first contribution studies the effect of different recovery options on the inventory and bullwhips in hybrid production-distribution systems (PDS). The System Dynamic model developed in the study also provides a comprehensive description for the structure of the PDS. The second contribution benchmarks the core competencies within the supply chain network and establishes a set of attributes for augmenting Supply Chain Agility. They utilize multi-criteria decision making methods to model the problem. The third contribution introduces an approach for the design of a decision support system to supports the wood product export process of a Chilean enterprise. This work addresses a wood distribution planning problem through an optimization model. The fourth paper presents pricing decisions for new and differentiated remanufactured products in a close-loop supply chain with a separate sales channel. The models developed enrich the literature on pricing decisions in the close-loop supply chain in which channel separation for new and remanufactured products is introduced. Sustainability and the environment are covered in the papers by Gonçalves et al. (2017) , Sudarto et al. (2017) , Tan et al. (2017)  and Perroni et al. (2017) . The first paper develops a maturity framework for supporting and guiding sustainable operations management. It identifies an evolutionary path, which goes from an initial approach focused on compliance aspects and firm value protection to an innovative approach based on corporate social responsibility supported by operations and long-term value development. The second paper aims at developing efficient flexible long-term capacity planning policy for closed-loop supply chains that considers social responsibility or a supply chain with Reverse Logistics Social Responsibility. It aims at answering an important research question on how to tackle the lifecycle with its inherited uncertainty to achieve optimal sustainability dimensions performance. The third paper, through a series of case studies in China, examines the various unintended impacts of environmental regulation on firms' operations and their related consequences to performance. Findings showed that there were three main themes that underpin the indirect and unintended effects of regulatory control and measures. The fourth paper studies the relationship between enterprise efficiency and the adoption of energy efficiency practices. Considering the practices, it also wants to answer the question about the existence of differences in efficiency among the enterprises that adopted certain practices and those that did not. The results show that not necessarily the most efficient companies are those that are more concerned with environmental issues. On the other hand, no significant evidence was found to establish that there is a preference for practices by the more efficient companies. Finally, the issue of innovation is covered by Chung and Tan (2017) . Their paper aims to understand and identify the unique phases of Chinese innovation. In order to have a better understanding of Chinese SMEs’ product innovation development stages, this research compared the literature findings of Japan and South Korea product innovation stages. As a result, a unique three product innovation development pathway (Yin-Tiao-Chuang) is proposed by the authors to explicitly demonstrate the Chinese SMEs’ product innovation development, which has been identified to be quite different from those found in Japan and Korea. As Guest Editors of this Special Issue of the International Journal of Production Economics we would like to thank all the participants of the 23rd International Conference of Production Research, the authors of the selected papers for their contribution and the reviewers for the rigorous work they performed. We take the opportunity to invite the Production Research Community to continue researching and implementing new ways for making this a better society.
