School of Nursing, Faculty of Health York University 4700 Keele Street Toronto ON M3J 1P3 Canada       In August 2019, four American nurses were invited to speak at the 68th United Nations (UN) Civil Society Conference hosted in Salt Lake City, Utah. Dr. Elizabeth Schenk, Dr. Teddie Potter, Dr. Oriana Beaudet, and Ms. Cara Cook were told it was the first time Registered Nurses had presented at the conference. The presentation provided the ‘all nurse’ panel with the opportunity to exchange knowledge and experiences on global health issues with senior UN system officials, academics, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and members of the media. Over 3000 participants from more than 100 countries attend the high-level forum annually. The nurses were invited to participate for the fit of their work with the thematic focus of the conference on the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2015)  and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #11, how to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.” Their presentation addressed one of the most pressing social issues of our time, “Climate Crisis or Opportunity? Nursing Actions for a Healthy Future” (Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, 2019 ). Contextualizing their work within the UN's 2030 Agenda and SDGs allowed the nurse participants to familiarize attendees with nursing's knowledge base, professional scope of practice, and strategic positioning to help lead efforts to address social policy challenges in health care on a local and global scale. A lack of a nursing voice in high level conferences, panels, policies, reports, and the mainstream media has long been a disciplinary concern (Thew, 2018 ). The invisibility of nurses in social policy arenas can be traced in large part to assumptions about nursing's domain as the medical model (Holmes and Gastaldo, 2004 ). Both inside and outside the profession, the roles of nurses in efforts to address health inequities and promote social justice related to issues such as climate change, racism, food insecurity, homelessness, immigration, peace, and poverty are not well understood. The indiscernibility of a nursing discourse in a number of public forums aimed at tackling social issues has resulted in the sidelining of nursing knowledge and goals in many important policy and practice debates and decisions (Buresh and Gordon, 2013 ). The UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2015) and its associated Sustainable Development Goals, targets and indicators offer nurses a globally accepted framework to help articulate their social mandate and professional capacity to contribute not only to the improvement of medical problems, but also a diversity of social, political, and land-based issues that impact individual and community health and wellbeing. The 2030 Agenda is a collective call to action to end extreme poverty, reduce global inequities, and protect the planet by 2030 through collaboration on the SDGs (United Nations Foundation, 2019 ). The goals are universal, built on the premise that all countries are ‘developing’ and responsible for progress towards a sustainable future. Indeed, the 2030 Agenda and SDGs are the product of an unprecedented consultation process led by member states rather than the UN Secretary General and agencies— it was instead driven through a so-called ‘Open Working Group’ process that created space for civil society groups, non-state actors, multi stakeholder debates and “gave voice to the Global South” (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 , p. 9). Adopted by the leaders of over 190 countries, the 2030 Agenda and SDGs represent the world's shared plan for promoting social justice through a global vision that includes universal quality health care, peace, and prosperity where ‘no one is left behind.’ In this framework, development is viewed as complex, multifaceted, and non-linear, and correspondingly, health (SDG #3) is conceptualized as one of 17 interconnected goals and 169 development targets that are considered indivisible. The SDGs can subsequently be used to challenge the assumptions of the medical model that health is more simply a biological and/or epidemiological measure of the absence of disease and the domain of health care locally or globally is physical and mental health, health protection and disease containment (Government of Canada, 2019 ). For example, in the nurses’ presentation at the 68th UN Civil Society Conference, health and nursing were conceptualized in relation to four SDGs: climate action (#13), building sustainable cities and communities (#11), addressing gender inequality (#5), and advocacy for greater stewardship of life on land (#15). By contextualizing the work of nurses within the principles underpinning the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, the nurses were able to demonstrate to fellow delegates the links between the structural drivers of health, the benefits of community driven solutions, and nursing's potential to help reorient health care from its current organization primarily around diseases and health deficits towards more integrated models of care focused on social determinants, issues-based coalitions, and the connected goals of community development and planetary health. The global promise shaping the SDGs is commensurate with the values and social mandate of nursing. Nurses have long argued for a shift from the emphasis predominantly on biology, lifestyle and health behaviour of individuals towards greater “consideration of social systems, organizational priorities, professional behaviours, and other environmental factors” in health care (Stewart and Langille, 1995 , p. 77; see also Canadian Nurses Association [CNA], 2003 ; McGibbon et al., 2008 ). The full scope of nursing “encompasses the promotion of health [and] prevention of illness,” and “[w]ithin this broad spectrum of health care, the phenomenon of particular concern to nurses are individual, family and group responses to actual and potential health problems” (International Council of Nurses [ICN], 2017 , p. 9). Identifying and addressing the emotional and social conditions affecting client outcomes is central to the values and responsibilities articulated in the policies and position statements published by nurses, including attention to social justice (Community Health Nurses of Canada, 2019 ; Edwards and MacLean Davison, 2008 ), reverse innovation/global innovation flow (Premji and Hatfield, 2016 ), primary health care (CNA, 2015 ), and the social determinants of health (Registered Nurses Association of Ontario, 2013 ). According to the ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses (2012)  the role of nurses is to advocate “for equity and social justice in resource allocation, access to health care and other social and economic services” (p. 2). In A Voice to Lead: Achieving the SDGs , the ICN (2017)  further suggests that integrating the SDGs into professional practice will be an important step for accomplishing health equity, social justice and a sustainable future through health care, stating, “nurses wherever you work and whatever your role have a voice that can lead this change” (p. 55). Yet, there are few examples of nurses taking up the SDGs to articulate and promote their work and ideas in the scientific literature. To date, nurses’ engagement with the SDGs has primarily involved calls to action for greater consideration of the SDGs in nursing research, policy and practices (e.g. Benton and Schaffer, 2016 ; Dossey et al., 2019 ; Foster et al., 2019 ; Hughes, 2017 ; Kanbara et al., 2017 ; Rosa et al., 2019 ), and literature reviews guided by a singular SDG (see for e.g. Kennedy et al., 2018 , regarding maternal-child health) or the guiding principles of the SDG framework (e.g. Kurth, 2017 , related to planetary health) aimed at identify gaps in understanding and addressing the context of health in order to achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda. More studies are needed to understand the extent and impact of including content about the 2030 Agenda and SDGs in nursing education (Sawleshwarkar and Negin, 2017 ), and the lived experiences of implementing the SDGs from the perspective of nurses in resource-diverse settings (e.g. Ngunyulu et al., 2017 ; Nkowane and Ferguson, 2016 ; Spies et al., 2016 ). There are also only a few nurse authors encouraging a critical reflection on the governance of global health or the political processes required to understand how to land the SDGs and localize their targets and indicators (Chi et al., 2018 ; Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). Using a political economy lens, Chi et al., 2018)  identified important questions for promoting social justice that are often neglected in discussions about the SDGs in research, policy and program evaluation frameworks:1. Who determines what is a “successful” [health] program?  2. Who decides which program(s) a nation/community should implement?  3. Who decides the objectives a program should achieve?  4. Who decides the direction and priorities for health development in a nation/community?  5. Who finances the ambitious programs needed to achieve agreed to SDGs and national targets?    The authors warn that, “If people intimately affected by decisions have little or no voice in determining what programs are made available to help reach their [health] goals, then a purely technical evaluation of ‘success’ is problematic and largely irrelevant” (Chi et al., 2018 , p. 511–12). Public health nurses, for instance, can point to the persistent rates and recent outbreaks of medically manageable infectious diseases such as HIV, TB and Ebola among people with a history of marginalization as examples of the potential consequences of an overreliance on technical, expert-driven, prescriptive approaches to health care planning and delivery informed by the medical model (e.g. treatment cascades) at the expense of  more democratic and collaborative care planning (Juergensen, 2017 ). O'Manique (2018)  arrived at a similar conclusion in her review of the global impact of building a global public health response to infectious diseases around biomedical goals and measures: “The dominant narratives, however, pay scant attention to the conditions incubating those novel viruses [HIV, TB, Ebola and Zika], nor do they address in any meaningful way the social suffering of those who fall ill or experience more intensely the multiple impacts of epidemics” (p. 215). More critical analysis of the current models of health care delivery and styles of governance that constrain and support the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, may be important starting points for nurses interested in leading efforts to decolonize global health care and build more robust, integrated responses to health and social issues (Hancock, 2018 ). Indeed, the main barriers to actualizing the vision for global health as articulated in the 2030 Agenda lie within the shortcomings of overall global health governance as witnessed in the limitations of the management of infectious diseases. Bekker et al. (2018)  summarized the challenges as follows:Both the HIV response and the broader global health field share a commitment to the development of health systems that are capable of addressing several health challenges at the same time. In many settings, robust, if still flawed, service systems have been developed for certain populations (e.g., pregnant women, children) or for priority health conditions (e.g., maternal and child health, HIV, and other communicable diseases). However, health systems as a whole are largely unprepared for providing care that is holistic, universal, and well-coordinated. In the still-early years of the SDG era, the gap between reality and the vision of sustainable health remains gaping. (p. 315)   Collaborative approaches are needed to democratize approaches to health, bridge silos in the delivery of health care and capitalize on the multiple “paradigm-theory-methods” available across stakeholder groups to inform policies and develop the innovative and inclusive practices needed to transform the planet into an equitable, peaceful, prosperous, biodiverse and sustainable world (Holmes and Gagnon, 2018 ). The promise of the SDGs is a framework created by the consensus of world leaders and community stakeholders that can serve as a platform for dialogical engagement on goals, targets, indicators and actions capable of transcending boundaries and unifying the planet while preserving diversity. The implications for nursing are great, as it provides a once in a generation opportunity for the profession to present a global vision of health and the possibility of actualizing their full scope of practice in the process of health care delivery. Situated at the intersection of policies and the point-of-care in a variety of institutional and community settings, nurses are ideally positioned to help encourage the type of relational practices intuitive to the nursing profession that are needed to achieve “a greater effort to reach those who are left furthest behind, for deeper cooperation across all sectors and levels, and for a renewed focus on addressing the root causes of the economic, social and environmental determinants of health” (Dhaliwal, 2017 , p. 2). Nurses can be valuable allies in local, national and global efforts to advocate for integrated, collaborative models of care, indivisible from the goals of community development, a sustainable future, and health for all. Learning more about the SDGs and examining their potential to transform nursing policies and practices is a challenge and an opportunity to participate in an unprecedented global policy dialogue.         Conflicts of interest None.
