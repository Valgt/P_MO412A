Centre for Technology in Water and Wastewater School of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of Technology Sydney Ultimo NSW 2007 Australia       Amid the global energy crisis and environmental concerns, marine biomass, specifically seaweed, serves as a type of marine biomass with potential for conversion into sustainable energy in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). There is a pressing need to shift towards sustainable energy resources, and seaweed emerges as an underexplored renewable energy source. A thorough analysis of past, current, and emerging trends in seaweed biomass conversion takes place. Thermochemical processes and other conversion methods are detailed, evaluating their efficiencies, limitations, and advancements. Due to its rapid growth and rich carbohydrate content, seaweed proves to be a prime candidate for bioenergy production. Converting seaweed aids in carbon capture, nutrient recycling, and waste management, which positively impacts several UN SDGs. Challenges, including technological barriers, economic feasibility, and environmental concerns related to large-scale seaweed farming and energy conversion, are present. The potential of marine biomass, especially seaweed, in sustainable energy production becomes evident, highlighting its intricate nature. Advancements in conversion technologies, thorough life-cycle assessments, and stringent sustainability protocols are recommended. Future efforts should concentrate on in-depth feasibility studies and foster inter-disciplinary collaborations to address the multifaceted challenges of this energy transition, aligning it with the UN's sustainability aspirations.

Despite efforts, fossil fuels have consistently maintained a dominant presence, accounting for approximately 80% of the worldwide energy composition for many years. According to the Stated Policies Scenario ( STEPS) forecast, this figure is projected to decrease to under 75% by 2030 and slightly over 60% by 2050. The zenith of global energy-related CO2  emissions in the STEPS is expected in 2025, reaching 37 billion tonnes (Gt) annually, then receding to 32 Gt by 2050. This trajectory suggests a potential increase of roughly 2.5 °C in global average temperatures by the close of the 21st century [1] . The detrimental effects of fossil fuels on the environment, human health, and climate change call for a shift towards less harmful, renewable energy sources [2,3] . Amidst this challenge, biomass, in its diverse forms, has emerged as a promising, green, and cost-effective alternative. Its ability to be refined into valuable products, including fuels and chemicals, through the multi-step biorefining process, positions it as a viable alternative to fossil fuels [4,5] . Biofuels, a key energy product resulting from the biorefining process, hold significant potential [6] . They can be used to power vehicles, provide household heating, and generate electricity. However, biofuels are not homogeneous, and they are classified into first, second, and third generations, depending on the feedstocks used in their production process [7] . First-generation biofuels, also known as conventional biofuels, are derived from edible crops like wheat, sugarcane, rice, corn, sugar beets, and sorghum, which are traditionally used for food production. However, these biofuels have faced criticism due to their competition with food crops and their potential contribution to deforestation [8] . To overcome the challenges posed by the first generation, second-generation biofuels were developed. These biofuels are made from non-edible sources such as agricultural residues and woody crops [9] . The use of these feedstocks means that second-generation biofuels don't compete with food production, though their production process often requires more complex extraction and processing techniques due to the tougher nature of the feedstocks. This development aims to balance the quest for renewable energy with environmental and food security concerns [10] . The potential of third-generation biofuels, derived from marine resources such as microalgae, cyanobacteria and seaweeds, is increasingly attracting attention due to their high yield potential with reduced resource input. Among these, macroalgae stands out for its promise as a source of non-edible biofuel, owing to its rapid growth in saline water and resilience under challenging conditions. The production of algae-based biofuels presents several compelling advantages. These fuels pose no risk to human consumption, exhibit excellent composability, and are sulfur-free [11] . The composition of algae varies between species, influenced by both biotic and abiotic environmental factors, such as temperature and light [12] . Typically, algal ash content ranges from 18% to 55%, carbohydrates from 25% to 60%, proteins from 5% to 47%, and fats less than 5% [13] . Both the species of algae chosen and the processing method significantly impact the fuel conversion process, leading to the production of different types of fuels. Dubbed as third-generation biofuels, algae-based fuels possess attributes such as fast growth, high carbon dioxide absorption, and ease of cultivation even in harsh regions. These characteristics position algal-based biofuels as a potential solution to energy demands [14] . Moreover, harnessing algal biomass for biofuel production could mitigate dependence on non-renewable resources, such as petroleum. This is primarily because algal biomass naturally contains materials like acyl glycerides and fatty acids that can be efficiently converted to biodiesel and bioethanol. Therefore, the residual biomass following oil extraction can also be exploited, further enhancing the sustainability of this energy source [15,16] . Algae, through their photosynthetic processes, play a significant role in counteracting rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, a primary contributor to climate change and ocean acidification. As a considerable reservoir for anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, the world's oceans provide a crucial context for these mitigating processes. Beyond offering a food source, algae cultivation in aquaculture yields unique chemicals with potential biotechnological applications. Thus, it emerges as a compelling strategy for carbon dioxide reduction. In this discussion, we underscore the enormous potential of seaweeds (macroalgae) in absorbing inorganic carbon, acting as bio-renewable energy. In essence, seaweeds transform inorganic carbon into organic carbon, a resource that can be subsequently harnessed as fuel. This remarkable capacity extends to various marine plants, including diverse forms of seaweed, which provide meaningful contributions to society, the economy, and the environment. Approximately 48 million square kilometres across 132 countries comprise ideal cultivation grounds for various types of seaweed. Yet, only around 37–44 countries are utilizing merely 0.001% of this appropriate terrain for production, marking a significant missed opportunity [17] . By 2024, seaweed output is expected to surge to a staggering value of US$ 22.13 billion, positioning it as one of the world's fastest-growing industries [18,19] . Seaweeds function as ecological purifiers, extracting nutrients from water and maintaining ecosystem health, a contrast to land-based crop production that often requires expensive fertilizers and potentially harmful pesticides [20] . For instance, seaweed cultivation in China annually eliminates roughly 75,000 tonnes of nitrogen and 9,500 tonnes of phosphorus, significantly mitigating the effects of coastal eutrophication [21] . Owing to their efficacy in removing organic pollutants, heavy metals, and pathogens, seaweeds are employed in bioremediation and environmental cleansing [22,23] . Seaweeds also foster a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in running water, forming an ecological bedrock for natural water filtration [24] . With their high rate of biomass growth, seaweeds can mitigate climate change effects by curtailing coastal erosion, enhancing pH levels, and oxygenating aquatic ecosystems, thereby locally mitigating ocean acidification and deoxygenation [25–28] . Their role as carbon dioxide scavengers contributes to the reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the moderation of the greenhouse effect [17,29] . In an era marked by increasing global population and industrialization, adopting science-informed policies to encourage sustainable development is critical. Preservation and restoration of the environment are essential to navigate the challenges presented by unsustainable exponential growth. Recent studies suggest that seaweeds, as vital marine resources, contribute to ecological and sustainable living and offer solutions to global issues like the fuel crisis, water pollution, ocean acidification, and climate change. Seaweeds hold the potential to produce innovative, eco-friendly, nutrient-dense food sources and natural substances for the biomedical, food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries [30] . The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals provide a blueprint for peace and prosperity, aiming to address a host of global challenges. The focus on harnessing marine biomass, particularly seaweed, for sustainable fuel production through pyrolysis, seeks to contribute to several of these goals. In recent years, several review articles (Table 1  ) have focused on the topic of marine biomass for sustainable fuel production. However, this study offers a unique perspective by providing a comprehensive comparison of pyrolysis techniques, emphasizing the potential alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. By integrating a detailed examination of both conventional and advanced pyrolysis methods, this review offers readers a deeper understanding of the evolving state of marine biomass conversion.  2 Historical trend of seaweed utilisation Human interaction with seaweed traces back to the Neolithic era, as highlighted by several studies [37] , Interestingly, the first documented use of seaweeds is attributed to China nearly 1700 years ago [38] . Coastal communities, for ages, have recognized the versatility of various seaweed species, predominantly using them as food and feed. This later expanded to industrial applications, such as the production of gels and fertilizers [39] . Notably, historical accounts point to medicinal applications of seaweeds: brown algae treated goitre in ancient Chinese remedies, while other seaweeds were employed for gastrointestinal issues and childbirth complications [40] . The trajectory of seaweed's industrial significance has evolved, transitioning from mere fertilizer and potash sources to iodine and hydrocolloid production [41] . Throughout this journey, the envisioned potential of seaweed-based industries often surpassed their contemporary scale—a sentiment echoed over the past century and still relevant today [42] . Contemporary scholars anticipate a transformative role for seaweeds, moving beyond conventional food and feed to more valuable applications. This includes being a prime source for specialty polysaccharides, technical products, agronomic applications, and an array of functional products ranging from nutraceuticals to pharmaceuticals [43] . Moreover, bioenergy, with its vast volume potential, is emerging as a crucial application [44] . The modern approach to seaweed utilization, often termed the 'biorefinery approach,' prioritizes extracting valuable components while ensuring minimal waste and sustainable practices, thereby maximizing the utility of every seaweed component [45] .  3 Seaweed’s contribution in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals aim to address pressing global issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. The recent SOFIA report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations revealed that global algae production in 2020 reached 36 million tons wet weight. Asian producers lead in both volume and value, holding a commanding 98% market share. China and Indonesia are the top contributors, providing 56% and 27% of cultivated seaweed by volume. South Korea and the Philippines each contribute 4%. In contrast, countries outside Asia collectively accounted for less than 2% of the total cultivated seaweed volume in 2020 [46] . Seaweed production and utilization contribute significantly to multiple Sustainable Development Goals, indicating their potential for sustainable global development [47] . However, realizing this potential requires continued research and sustainable policies ensuring responsible and sustainable seaweed cultivation and utilization. Seaweeds have emerged as a vital resource contributing to several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. They are a nutritional powerhouse, rich in vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds, contributing to a balanced diet which is aligned with Goal 2. Their cultivation offers a sustainable solution to food security, since it does not necessitate arable land, freshwater, or fertilizers – elements that traditional agriculture is heavily reliant upon. In the context of Goal 8, seaweed farming brings employment opportunities to coastal regions. In countries like Indonesia, it has proven to be a significant income source for coastal communities [48] . Beyond its nutritional value, the potential to develop various value-added products from seaweeds paves the way for economic diversification and growth. Furthermore, aligning with Goal 9, the seaweed industry demands the development of innovative technologies for effective cultivation, processing, and product development. Advancements in biorefinery technologies, for instance, are facilitating the extraction of valuable compounds from seaweeds, thereby fostering innovation and enhancing industrial infrastructure [49] . Seaweeds crucially contribute to carbon sequestration, aiding in climate change mitigation, thereby supporting the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 13, Climate Action. Research by [50]  substantiates that seaweeds' carbon sequestration rate exceeds that of terrestrial plants. Furthermore, seaweed-based biofuels can lessen our dependence on fossil fuels, driving down greenhouse gas emissions. In alignment with sustainable development goal 14, Life Below Water, seaweed farming aids in enhancing water quality by absorbing surplus nutrients and pollutants. This was corroborated by a study by [51] , which indicated a significant reduction of excess nutrients in water bodies due to seaweed cultivation. Seaweed farms also bolster biodiversity by serving as habitats for diverse marine life [52] . To address sustainable development goal 15, Life on Land, seaweed cultivation presents a sustainable alternative to land-based crops for biofuel production, thereby alleviating strain on terrestrial ecosystems [53] . This is particularly pertinent considering the escalating demand for biofuels and the resultant threat of land use alterations and deforestation.  4 Composition of seaweed There are three distinct types of seaweed, and they are brown, red, and green. It is possible to divide seaweeds, also known as macroalgae, into three distinct groups: green algae, also known as Chlorophyta , red algae, also known as Rhodophyta , and ochrophyta , also known as Phaeophyceae  (brown algae). The colour of the thallus is responsible for the majority of this classification, but the various types of macroalgae also have significantly different chemical compositions, which is another important factor in the classification. For example, polysaccharides such as alginates and fucoidans can be found in high concentrations in edible brown algae species such as Laminaria digitata [54–56] . It’s been observed that the carbohydrate content of seaweed ranges from 23.8 to 67%, while the protein content ranges from 4.8 to 23%, lipid content ranges from 0.53 to 4.8%, and ash content ranges from 14 to 42% [57] . When compared to green algae, brown seaweeds have a biomass that contains a lower proportion of protein and a higher proportion of carbohydrates (a high C/N ratio). This makes brown seaweeds better suited for anaerobic digestion. The characteristics of seaweed are quite distinct from those of terrestrial plants. In comparison to terrestrial biomass, macroalgae contain relatively high concentrations of water (90 % fresh wt.), carbohydrates (25 % dry wt.), and protein (7 to 15 % dry wt.), but relatively low concentrations of lipids (1 to 5 % dry wt.). In comparison to terrestrial plants, macroalgae are very different in terms of their chemical make-up, as well as their physiological and morphological characteristics. When compared to the biomass of terrestrial species, macroalgae have significantly higher concentrations of water (70–90 percent fresh weight) and minerals, such as alkali metals (10–50 percent dry weight) [58] . In contrast, they have low levels of protein (7–15 percent dry wt.) and lipids (1–5 percent dry wt.) [59] , whereas the majority of microalgae have the high content of protein (40–60 percent dry wt.) and intermediate lipids (10–20 percent dry wt.) [60,61] . In comparison to lignocellulosic biomass derived from land, these types of biomasses have larger proportions of nitrogen and sulphur and lower concentrations of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. In addition, the heating value of many different types of seaweed is frequently quite a bit lower than the corresponding values for energy crops and other types of biomasses. On the other hand, the ash content is typically higher. In addition to this, when compared to the metal and halogen content of terrestrial biomass, the amounts found in extra-terrestrial biomass are significantly higher. In contrast to the considerable amounts of chlorine that are frequently found in land-based biomass, bromine and iodine are frequently found in marine macroalgae and seaweeds. They do not possess any lignin and do not have any cellulose [58] . The composition of various macroalgal sources is displayed in Fig. 1  . Carrageenan, mannitol, agar, laminarin, mannan, ulvan, fucoidin, and alginate are some of the distinctive components that can be found in macroalgae [57] . These compounds have a potential market value, as well as a value in commercial applications. A significant amount of the carbohydrates laminarin and mannitol can be found in brown macroalgae. Both Macrocystis and laminaria typically contain around 21 and 26 percent (dry basis) of these two different types of carbohydrates [62] . The molecule known as laminarin is a glucose polysaccharide, and it has the function of storing glucose. Brown algae are found in great quantities there [63] . Mannitol is another essential component that can be found in seaweed. It is categorised as a sugar alcohol and has a total of six carbon atoms in its structure. It has been discovered that mannitol can be used successfully as a sweetener in a variety of food products, particularly those intended for diabetic diets. Mannitol has a lower calorific value than the vast majority of other sugars. It has also been discovered to have effective medicinal applications, such as reducing cellular oedema and improving urine output [64] .  5 Conversion technologies of seaweed into energy There are three basic categories that may be used to classify the various conversion technologies that are used in order to make use of seaweed or marine biomass. The characteristics of the feedstock, the desired form of the energy and the end products, environmental regulations, and economic considerations are some of the factors that are taken into account in the process of determining which method of conversion is the most appropriate for a given application [65] . Seaweeds have a high concentration of phycocolloids  such as agar-agar, alginate, carrageenan, laminarin, and ulvan, amongst others. These phycocolloids  can be consumed and are utilised in a variety of commercial and industrial applications. Because phycocolloids  are difficult to disassemble, the manufacturing of biofuel must first undergo a specialised pretreatment process. There is the potential to employ seaweeds as an alternative source for the generation of bioethanol, biogas, biobutanol, biomethanol, and biohydrogen. The fermentation process, either aerobic or anaerobic, can be used to effectively convert sugars found in seaweeds into biofuel. These sugars include glucose, cellulose, and galactose, among others [66] . Bioethanol is a clear, colourless, volatile, and flammable liquid that mixes with water and oxygenated liquid hydrocarbons. It has a strong smell and a burning taste [67] . At this time, converting galactose to ethanol on a big scale is still a difficult operation, and accurate data on the process is not yet available in detail. There is very limited research’s yet on the fermentation of galactose. Galactose and glucose both have the similar structure, and both have hexose sugar, with the exception of a single carbon atom in the C4  position having a different stereochemistry. Contrarily, it was observed that most of the bacteria and yeast that were shown to be effective for the fermentative oxidation of galactose source were also discovered to be beneficial for the fermentation of glucose source [66] . It was discovered that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is most commonly associated with the fermentation process, is also capable of fermenting galactose. S. cerevisiae  was demonstrating evidence of remarkable fermentative ability on galactose, according to the analysis of the relevant literature [68] . Red seaweed Gracilaria sp . contains d-galactose as agarose polymer, making yeast conversion to ethanol problematic. However, pre-treatment and hydrolysis make the substrate ideal for yeast fermentation to provide significant ethanol yields. pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen all affect fermentation. Yeast transforms simple carbohydrates like d-galactose into ethanol during fermentation's stationary phase [66] . Because ethanol is converted, there is a continuous decrease in the amount of simple sugars. The amount of sugar that is present in the medium in which ethanol is fermented has a direct bearing on the theoretical yield of ethanol. According to the theoretical calculation, the fermentation process results in the production of half a gramme of ethanol for every gramme of sugar that is used [66] . Fig. 2   shows different conversion technologies, such as chemical conversion, thermochemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. The thermochemical conversion process makes use of heat as a source of conversion energy to transform the feedstock into a variety of distinct end products. The time needed for the thermally induced chemical conversion process is often shorter, and the temperature can be more easily controlled [69] . Pyrolysis, combustion, torrefaction, liquefaction, and gasification are examples of some of the most popular thermochemical conversion processes that are employed today. The decomposition of biomass can be accomplished through pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere under moderate working circumstances [70] . This method is considered to be one of the more popular approaches among those that are available. Algal biomass, an abundant and renewable source of energy, can be effectively converted into useful products through various thermochemical conversion processes. These processes, including pyrolysis, gasification, liquefaction, and combustion, each have unique operational parameters and outputs, despite all requiring heat as an input [34] . This apparent similarity belies the fact that the energy or biofuel produced by each process varies significantly in nature, largely due to the specific physicochemical transformations occurring during each method. Furthermore, these properties are not static, as they can be altered depending on the prevailing operational conditions, adding another layer of complexity and potential adaptability to these processes. Comparatively, pyrolysis is versatile, as it can yield a range of products across all three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. On the other hand, liquefaction is more specific, generating only liquid yields from the biomass. This distinction showcases the unique capabilities of these conversion processes [71] . Gasification and combustion, while different, each serve a specific purpose. Gasification primarily results in gaseous products, such as fuel gas and syngas, valuable for many industrial applications [72] . In contrast, combustion primarily yields heat and power, direct sources of energy that can be immediately harnessed. All things considered, pyrolysis stands out for its ability to produce a broad spectrum of converted products from biomass, providing a flexibility not seen in the other thermochemical conversion processes. This underlines its potential as a key player in sustainable energy production from algal biomass [73] . The production of biofuel employs various techniques, one of which includes extracting lipids from macroalgae, and subsequently transforming these lipids into biodiesel through the methods of esterification and transesterification [74] . Additionally, biochemical processes such as fermentation, photobiological reactions, and anaerobic digestion can convert the biomass of algae into bioethanol, methane, and hydrogen [75] . Another promising approach, however, is thermochemical conversion, a process that entails the thermal degradation of organic components within biomass to yield biofuels. Despite being somewhat overlooked in the past, this approach has recently been thrust back into the limelight due to its potential advantages over both chemical and biological processes. What sets thermochemical conversion apart is its simplicity and efficiency in biofuel production. This process leverages heat and chemical reactions, which significantly impact the production of products and energy [76] . The attractiveness of this process stems from the increasing recognition of its ability to produce biofuels more efficiently than its counterparts. The focal point of our exploration is the thermochemical conversion of seaweed, with a particular emphasis on pyrolysis technology [77] . This subject is elaborated in greater detail in the ensuing sections. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of this potential solution to sustainable biofuel production.  6 Pyrolysis of seaweed The process of pyrolysis is considered an extremely efficient method of thermal conversion, resulting in a substantial increase in bio-oil production [78] . This method involves the creation of gaseous products that typically have a superior net calorific value compared to the products of combustion and gasification. Furthermore, pyrolysis operates at a lower temperature range than combustion and gasification, making it a more energy-efficient choice [79] . However, the efficiency of these processes may be influenced by the water content of the biomass used. For instance, a high-water content in algae biomass can negatively impact the efficiency of gasification. As a result, the conversion of macroalgal biomass, which often contains high water content, may necessitate an additional thermal dewatering step before biofuel production [80] . This additional step can increase the energy cost of the overall process. A potential alternative method for creating biofuels from algae biomass, which often has a high moisture content, is the hydrothermal liquefaction technique [81] . This method leverages the high moisture content of the feedstocks, unlike other processes that may see it as a hindrance. Besides its higher energy efficiency and lower operating temperatures relative to other thermochemical methods such as pyrolysis and gasification, it offers an interesting alternative for biofuel production [82] . However, it is important to note that this technique requires complex and costly equipment. Interestingly, the bio-oil produced from the pyrolysis of macroalgae boasts a high heating value comparable to fossil-derived fuels, due to its elevated energy content [82] . One of the major advantages of pyrolysis is the ability to fine-tune the final output, be it char, liquid, or gas, through control of the operational parameters. In essence, pyrolysis leads to the production of bio-oil, a biofuel that is easy to store and transport [83] . The pyrolysis process itself is irreversible and versatile, capable of breaking down a range of materials including organics and polymers [84] . Through the application of heat, it induces a change in both the physical phase and chemical composition of the materials. Beyond biofuel production, pyrolysis finds uses in the chemical industry for producing methanol, charcoal, and activated carbon. Additionally, during waste sorting for pyrolysis, other valuable materials such as stones, ceramics, glass, and soil can be salvaged and repurposed for construction or landfill coverings [85] . In the realm of energy recovery methods, pyrolysis offers significant benefits. It can handle a diverse range of feedstocks and reduces the amount of waste destined for landfills, consequently reducing landfill gas emissions and contamination risks [86] . Thus, pyrolysis proves to be a promising technique in the realm of sustainable biofuel production and waste management. 6.1 Classification of pyrolysis technology Pyrolysis processes primarily fall into two categories: the conventional method and the advanced method [32] . These are differentiated by the mechanisms used and the nature of products produced. The conventional pyrolysis processes are subdivided into three types: slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, and flash pyrolysis [32] . Each one of these has distinct procedural characteristics that define their operational conditions and output products. Slow pyrolysis is typically performed over an extended period, whereas fast and flash pyrolysis are rapid processes with diverse product ranges [87] . In contrast, the advanced pyrolysis method, also known as the non-traditional method, is a more refined process. It primarily focuses on enhancements to the standard pyrolysis processes in order to optimise the yield, quality, features, and properties of the pyrolytic products [88] . This optimization could include adjustments to the pyrolysis temperature, yield enhancement of specific products, and reduction in processing time, all targeted towards increasing product selectivity in the pyrolysis process [89,90] . In the subsequent section, we delve deeper into these pyrolysis methodologies, providing a comprehensive overview of both standard and advanced pyrolysis settings. The focus will be on the impact these processes have on the product distribution when using microalgae as the feedstock. It will also highlight the unique contributions of each technology to the overall pyrolysis framework. To give a more holistic view, Fig. 3   will offer a comparative analysis of the different standard and advanced pyrolysis techniques. It will elucidate the respective benefits of each technique, enabling a clearer understanding of their unique strengths and suitability in various applications. This comparison is critical in developing a thorough comprehension of the complexities and potentials of pyrolysis technologies. 6.1.1 Conventional pyrolysis of seaweed Pyrolysis is an established thermochemical process used to transform algal biomass into diverse products, such as solids, liquids, and gases. This transformation depends heavily on the parameters within which the pyrolysis is conducted. There are four primary types of pyrolysis, namely, slow pyrolysis, intermediate pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, and flash pyrolysis, each differentiated by key factors such as temperature, residence time, heating rate, and particle size, among other variables [91,92] . In the realm of these pyrolytic processes, the rate of heating serves a critical role in determining both the kind of pyrolysis to be executed on the algal biomass, and how the resultant products are distributed. Essentially, the heating rate dictates how rapidly the algal biomass is heated [93,94] , consequently steering the conversion and distribution of pyrolytic products. This area of research, pertaining to algal pyrolysis, has been extensively reviewed and investigated [89,94–97] ; Despite this extensive body of research, a noticeable dearth of studies exists in the specific area of pyrolysis involving seaweeds or marine biomass. As such, research gaps remain and demand further exploration [91,98] . Table 2   offers an encapsulation of the vital experimental parameters typically associated with conventional pyrolysis studies. Following this, a comprehensive review and analysis of traditional pyrolysis and its current applications to algal biomass will be presented in the subsequent section. By gaining a deeper understanding of these processes, we stand to unlock more efficient and sustainable ways of utilizing algae and other forms of marine biomass. 6.1.1.1 Slow pyrolysis The slow pyrolysis process, characterized by a low heating rate, extended dwell time, and lower temperatures, is an effective method for converting biomass into biochar and bio-oil. This method utilizes a heating rate ranging from 0.1 to 10 °C per second, with thermal decomposition taking place around 400–500 °C [89] . The preferable formation of char in slow pyrolysis can be attributed to the lower temperatures and slower heating rates employed. The typical processes involved in slow pyrolysis include the removal of water, breakdown of organic fractions to liberate primary volatiles, and the subsequent production of carbon-rich residues. Gaseous products such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen are also generated in this process [105,106] . Slow pyrolysis has been employed to thermally decompose three different types of seaweed—Undaria pinnatifida, Laminaria japonica, and Porphyra tenera —at temperatures between 300 °C and 600 °C [100] . Due to the distinct physicochemical properties of each seaweed type, the products yielded varied in quantity and chemical composition. As expected from prior studies, the yield of bio-oil and syngas from all macroalgae increased with pyrolysis temperature, whereas biochar production decreased [92,107–109] . Maintaining the temperature below 400 °C yielded a product composition in line with earlier observations [110] . the charcoal fraction was most abundant, followed by the liquid and gaseous products. Two distinct components, aqueous and organic, with differing Higher Heating Value (HHV), were produced in the bio-oil during the slow pyrolysis process. Lower HHV was observed in the aqueous phase, which was correlated with higher O2  concentrations [111] . Among these seaweeds, Laminaria japonica had the highest HHV for both the aqueous phase (12.25 MJ/kg) and the organic phase (33.58 MJ/kg). Interestingly, while gaseous products from terrestrial biomass had high yield values (>90 wt%), those from the tested seaweed varieties had modest yield values (10–25 wt%) and primarily generated carbon dioxide as the main by-product [100] . Recent research on biochar production from six different types of seaweed using slow pyrolysis revealed that all seaweed types generated biochar with moderate HHV values (10.72–17.81 MJ/kg) and substantial yields (45.31%–62.41% wt.). Notably, all biochar samples contained sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which could potentially serve as valuable soil fertilizers for agricultural purposes [92,110,112,113] . Slow pyrolysis is among the most researched conversion processes used for seaweed, due in large part to the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of the required equipment. However, due to the slow heating rate and extended reaction time, this method can result in a higher quantity of solid waste and gaseous by-products. Consequently, low-temperature pyrolysis has been employed to maximize biochar yield alongside the production of gaseous by-products. For this reason, pyrolysis is often conducted within the lower temperature range of 300–425 °C [114] .  6.1.1.2 Fast pyrolysis Fast pyrolysis is an innovative and promising technique for the production of bio-oil, particularly because it operates at a significantly higher heating rate, ranging between 300 and 700 °C per minute [115] . This rapid heating is conducted under oxygen-depleted conditions, with the temperature maintained between 400 and 700°Celsius [115] . To optimize the process, the biomass is first dehydrated and milled into a fine powder with a particle size of 1 mm or smaller. This biomass is then subjected to intense heating in the reactor, which decomposes it into shorter chain molecules and gases [116] . It is the next phase, rapid cooling, that fosters the production of liquid biofuels. For optimal oil yield from biomass, it is imperative to have a higher heating rate, higher temperature, and shorter residence time, followed by swift cooling. On average, the fast pyrolysis technique delivers oil production yields between 65% and 75%, while solid product yields are estimated at 15% to 25%, and gaseous product yields fall between 10% and 20% [117] . Hence, this method is highly appealing in the context of bio-oil production. The yield and Higher Heating Value (HHV) of bio-oil can be quite high, depending on the specific conditions. For instance, conversion of algal biomass may yield up to 72% oil by weight with an HHV of 18.4 MJ/kg. It's noteworthy that liquid yields from the pyrolysis of algae like Chlorella protothecoides  and Microcystis aeruginosa  were found to be 18% and 24%, respectively [118] . Interesting insights emerged from a study [101] . in which Saccharina japonica was subjected to fast pyrolysis in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor. Upon increasing the temperature from 350 to 500-degree Celsius, the bio-oil yield dropped from 44.99 to 26.67 wt%, while the biochar yield increased from 34.20 to 39.18 wt%, and the syngas yield rose from 20.81 to 34.15 wt%. Through the comprehensive study conducted by [119] , it was established that while certain forms of biomass such as palm kernel shells necessitate high pyrolysis temperatures around 600° C, seaweed-based biomass was particularly amenable to lower temperatures. This has led to a re-evaluation of earlier assumptions concerning seaweed's resistance to high temperatures. Indeed, the generation of bio-oil from specific seaweed exhibited optimal results at a significantly lower temperature of 350° C. This lower temperature requirement is noteworthy given that higher pyrolysis temperatures typically stimulate subsequent cracking processes [91,119,120] . While bio-oil yield has been on the decline with syngas yield on an uptrend, bio-oil production was maximised at a rate of 4.0 to 4.5 L/min at this lower temperature due to the effects of fluidisation, even though the highest heating value (HHV) was not the optimal 24.80 MJ/kg. A similar study that employed the same seaweed type as feedstock for fast pyrolysis also validated this concept, albeit utilising a fixed-bed reactor. This process managed to effectively control the formation of unwanted compounds such as tar, char and alginate, thereby ensuring a smooth workflow in the reactor [121] . Both the bio-oil (30.0–33.2 MJ/kg) and the biochar (11.8–12.4 MJ/kg) produced from Saccharina japonica demonstrated significant energy levels. Furthermore, the yield quality was not only commendable, but the properties were also highly desirable. Fast pyrolysis, with its high heating rates and operational conditions, is a technique of choice when bio-oil is the principal product. This method often results in higher quantities of the main product when compared to slow pyrolysis, with the type of biomass used playing a substantial role in the yield of bio-oil. Miao, Wu [122]  and Zainan, Srivatsa, Li, Bhattacharya [123]  inspected the influence of cultivation methods on bio-oil yield. The study utilized the Chlorella protothecoides algae and tested it under two growth stages: autotrophic and heterotrophic. Remarkably, heterotrophic cultivation of Chlorella protothecoides  resulted in a bio-oil yield that was 3.4 times higher than its autotrophic counterpart, indicating the potential role of cultivation methods in optimizing bio-oil production.  6.1.1.3 Flash pyrolysis Flash pyrolysis is a noteworthy technique that facilitates substantial recovery of syngas and premium bio-oil with a notably low water content. This process operates at temperatures between 700 and 900 °C or higher and requires a remarkable heating rate exceeding 1000 °C per second. The residence time is significantly less than that required for fast pyrolysis, taking less than 0.5 s [124,125] . Given the extreme heating rates involved, the feedstock particle size needs to be as minute as possible for maximum efficiency [126] . Moreover, flash pyrolysis possesses the ability to convert approximately 80% of the feedstock energy into diverse energy products. Interestingly, the energy density of these produced products is higher than that of the raw feedstock [100] . Although flash pyrolysis is often conflated with rapid pyrolysis, the product fractions from flash pyrolysis are primarily classified into two output categories, oil and gas, eliminating solid products [127] . However, the bio-oil produced from this process contains a substantial quantity of oxygen, signifying the product's corrosiveness and instability. It also contains contaminants like heavy metals and nitrogen, which necessitate the use of expensive hydrogen for removal. Flash pyrolysis, an area that has been extensively researched and reviewed over the years, still merits an in-depth exploration of its effects. Such an investigation was pioneered by [58] . In their novel study, they employed five distinct types of seaweed, including Fucus vesiculosus, Chorda filum, Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus, and Laminaria hyperborea , each carefully selected and transported from South America for the purpose of this research. In a further extension of their work, they also incorporated Macrocystis pyrifera  into their experimental design. Through the course of their investigation, Ross, Jones, Kubacki, Bridgeman [58]  unveiled that each seaweed variety yielded its own distinct set of compound signatures. Notably, they identified an array of oxygenated and nitrogen-containing compounds with low molecular weight, underpinning the variety in the products of flash pyrolysis across different types of seaweed. This diversity and uniqueness in compound formation underscore the nuances involved in the flash pyrolysis process and its relationship with the type of seaweed used. Despite flash pyrolysis attracting considerable research interest, its implementation, particularly in the realm of algal biomass, is challenging due to complex and costly equipment setup [93] . Several pyrolyser such as flow reactors and fluidised bed reactors, while capable of handling rapid heating and short residence periods, possess complex architectures that are costly and difficult to implement [95] . Consequently, flash pyrolysis hasn't seen widespread industrial-scale application due to these economic and practical constraints.   6.1.2 Advanced pyrolysis of seaweed The term “advanced pyrolysis techniques” collectively refers to a multitude of innovative methods currently employed in the pyrolysis process [128] . These techniques serve to enhance the process and the quality of its end products. One such advanced technique involves the use of catalysts, a process also known as “catalytic pyrolysis.” Catalysts function to accelerate the pyrolysis process, making it significantly more efficient [129] . Another innovative technique involves the co-processing of different forms of biomass, materials, or waste with the pyrolysis. This integration aims to refine the quality of pyrolytic products currently available in the market. Additionally, a third approach to enhancing the pyrolysis process is through the modification of pyrolysis parameters. Factors such as the reaction environment and pyrolysis pressure can be altered to further optimize the process [130] . Yet another sophisticated approach lies in the incorporation of external technologies. This integration seeks to improve the heating process of pyrolysis, thereby boosting the overall efficiency of the procedure. Indeed, it is often the case that a combination of two or more of these advanced techniques are used to maximise the efficacy of the pyrolysis process [130] . In the following subsections, we will delve deeper into the state-of-the-art technology employed specifically in the pyrolysis of seaweed. Furthermore, Table 3   provides a summary of the experimental settings and findings derived from the most cutting-edge studies in advanced pyrolysis. 6.1.2.1 Catalytic pyrolysis of seaweed The pyrolysis process, especially when processing seaweed, can be significantly improved with the application of catalysts. Bio-oils, often produced from seaweed processing, typically contain a high quantity of oxygen. This presence of oxygen requires mitigation in order to enhance the stability of the oil, increase its energy density, and decrease its acidity. By preventing processes like polymerisation and condensation, the oil's usefulness can be greatly improved. Furthermore, the high nitrogen content in bio-oil can be reduced with the right conditions using a catalyst. Thus, catalytic pyrolysis may be a feasible method to elevate the quality of seaweed bio-oil [142] . It's suggested that the use of a suitable catalyst could change the sequence of reactions during the pyrolysis process. This change could lead to an in-situ upgrading of the bio-oil produced. Catalytic pyrolysis can be executed in two ways: the catalyst-bed method and the catalyst-mixing approach [143] . The catalyst-bed method involves layering biomass and catalyst, with quartz wool used as a filler. The bed's temperature is maintained at the necessary level for pyrolysis, and vapours pass through it. In contrast, the catalyst-mixing approach involves physical blending of the catalyst and biomass before placing them in the reactor. The temperature range for catalytic pyrolysis is generally between 300 and 600 °C. The preferred catalysts for seaweed pyrolysis are often zeolite-based, a type of mineral. Using a zeolite catalyst in pyrolysis under catalytic conditions can yield a maximum carbon production of 24% aromatics, with over 70% being monocyclic aromatics of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) [144] . In similar studies, the amount of carbon derived from aromatic hydrocarbons rose when the ratio of zeolite catalyst to seaweed increased from 0 to 9. In the catalytic pyrolysis of Tetraselmis sp. and different Isochrysis species, cerium-based catalysts were used. These tests aimed to assess the quantity and quality of the pyrolysis products in a fixed bed reactor [145] . The experiments concluded that an alumina-based catalyst wasn't ideal for Isochrysis algae because it resulted in decreased bio-oil and syngas production. However, CeO2  and zirconia-supported catalysts positively affected the reaction. Likely, the catalyst's acidity and the dehydration during the synthesis of charred species affected this outcome [146] . Moreover, the Ni-Ce/ZrO2  catalyst displayed a bio-oil yield of 25.49% for the Isochrysis reaction, and the combinations of Ni-Ce/Al2 O2  and Ni-Ce/ZrO2  catalysts positively affected the volume of bio-oils produced by Tetraselmis, showing higher yields than those from non-catalytic pyrolysis. Interestingly, the Ni-Ce/Al2 O2  catalyst combination produced more bio-oils than the Ni-Ce/ZrO2  catalyst. Bio-oil generated using ceria-based catalysts had higher heating values of 34–35 MJ/kg, low levels of oxygen (reduced from 40 to 41% to 9–15%), and a reduction in nitrogen content by 15–20% [147] . This oil also contained a larger share of aliphatic molecules and a smaller proportion of nitrogen compounds, as verified by 1H NMR and GC–MS analyses [148] . Ceria, or CeO2 , increases stability, the dispersion of Ni, and carbon suppression due to the cracking activity of Ni and the combined effect of Ce-Al and Ce-Zr. This explains why CeO2  is crucial in these processes [149] . According to [124] , non-catalytic rapid processes produce substantial amounts of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. A study using Nannochloropsis oculata with Co-Mo/Al2 O3  at an optimal temperature of 500 °C aimed to understand the effect of the catalyst. This study showed that catalyst use enhances the production of olefins and fatty nitriles [124] . Therefore, the use of catalysts is integral to the optimization of the pyrolysis process and the resulting bio-oil quality.  6.1.2.2 Microwave assisted pyrolysis of seaweed Since the dawn of the 21st century, the scientific community has developed a substantial interest in microwave-assisted pyrolysis, particularly in the context of seaweed energy extraction. This method has demonstrated remarkable potential in recent studies, suggesting that the utilization of microwaves could revolutionize conventional pyrolysis methods. In the microwave-assisted pyrolysis process, seaweed is mixed with a microwave-absorbing substance such as particulate carbon. This absorber plays a critical role in converting microwave radiation into ample thermal energy, necessary for extensive pyrolysis [150] . These microwave reactors are superior to traditional ones in various ways; they provide uniform and rapid heating rates, enable faster processing times, and help reduce operating costs. Unlike other methods, microwave energy is directly transferred to the material via molecular interactions within the electromagnetic field. This direct heating significantly reduces the time spent heating the surrounding environment [151] . It is noteworthy that such reactors can quickly attain a pyrolysis temperature of 1000 °C within mere minutes [152] . However, the effectiveness of microwave reactors is significantly influenced by the dielectric characteristics of the material used, which is also one of the main challenges for industrializing this technology. For instance, seaweed has a relatively low dielectric constant. This problem can be mitigated by using carbon as a microwave absorber during the pyrolysis process, which helps increase the energy absorption and its conversion into heat [150] . In an experiment with Gracilaria  as the feedstock for microwave-assisted pyrolysis, the results included a low bio-oil yield (2.8–16.3%) and a high charcoal output (33–72.0%) [139] . Unlike cellulose, which requires temperatures around 180 °C, Gracilaria disintegrated at a lower temperature of 130 °C. Despite the low bio-oil yield, seaweed-based microwave-assisted synthesis produced higher bio-oil yields due to seaweed's inherent high moisture content of approximately 7%. Further exploration of this technology with Geledium species of algae showed promising results; microwave power between 200 and 300 W enhanced syngas fraction synthesis with lighter chemicals by 37.15 wt% [140] . Although the bio-oil yield was not substantial, its heating value was the highest among all pyrolytic products, suggesting that microwave-assisted pyrolysis might stimulate gas product generation. Moreover, another study conducted by Hong et al. [141]  demonstrated that Porphyra, due to its high carbohydrate content, produced a maximum syngas production of 87 wt% under microwave-assisted pyrolysis. Porphyra's high combustible biomass components, moisture content, density, and dielectric properties may contribute to its accelerated heating rate during microwave pyrolysis. However, the bio-oil produced from this seaweed between 400 and 700 °C had low Higher Heating Values (2.5 – 3.4 MJ/kg), limiting its use in energy applications. In contrast, biochar products showcased high HHV values, ranging between 13.8 and 18.2 MJ/kg. Recent discoveries in the field of technology reveal the utility of microwaves in facilitating chemical reactions, notably improving the synthesis of syngas, a lighter chemical faction. Studies showed a remarkable enhancement of 37.15 wt% in the reaction rate when microwaves were employed. However, an area that did not achieve the desired outcome was the production of bio-oil. Even though the output quantity was not as high as anticipated, it's worth noting that the bio-oil exhibited the highest heating value among all the pyrolytic products, signifying its potential as an efficient energy source. Simultaneously, another key finding from this study is the impact of microwave-assisted pyrolysis on gas product generation. This process notably increases the yield of gas products, thereby adding another dimension to its advantages. In line with these observations, research conducted by [141]  demonstrates a noteworthy case where the high carbohydrate content of Porphyra, a type of seaweed, resulted in an extraordinary production of syngas, reaching up to 87 wt%. This exceptional yield was achieved when Porphyra was subjected to microwave-assisted pyrolysis, reinforcing the aforementioned benefits of using microwaves in such processes.  6.1.2.3 Hydropyrolysis of seaweed Hydropyrolysis, a specific branch of pyrolysis, involves the use of nitrogen as a transport medium. This process takes place in an environment of highly pressurised hydrogen, which is essential for the occurrence of thermal breakdown. There is a direct correlation between the quality of structural preservation methods and hydrocarbon production; superior methods frequently yield more hydrocarbons relative to other techniques [153] . The principal goal of hydropyrolysis is to generate bio-oil with a reduced oxygen content. However, the rate of yield in this process exhibits a high sensitivity to temperature. According to research conducted by [154,155] , optimal conditions for bio-oil and biogas production involve a temperature of 310 °C, a pressure of 3 MPa, and a duration of 60 min [156] . The major by-product of hydropyrolysis oil, aside from the unreacted hydrogen, includes carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane. The effective management of these by-products and the consistent production of bio-oil underscore the technical and environmental significance of this process. As such, hydropyrolysis stands out as an important technique in the realm of sustainable energy production, providing a viable path towards the creation of low-oxygen, high-energy biofuels [157] . The pioneering study by [158]  utilised a batch reactor for the purpose of examining the efficacy of a specific technique. This technique was hydropyrolyzing chlorella pyrenoidosa , a method employed in the production of liquid fuels. Their primary objective was to ascertain whether this technique culminated in the maximal bio-oil yield. Their study took an in-depth approach, evaluating the effects of various process parameters such as temperature, time, and initial hydrogen pressure on product yields. Furthermore, they also scrutinised the attributes of the resultant hydropyrolysis oil (HPO). Their conclusion underscored that temperature significantly affected the hydropyrolysis characteristics as well as the yields of each product. Interestingly, they discovered that hydrogen could function as a stabilising agent for active intermediates. However, even under conditions of high initial pressure and an abundance of hydrogen, it was not guaranteed that hydropyrolysis would occur. The constituents of hydropyrolysis notably included nitriles, amides, amines, and carboxylic acids, in addition to aromatics and straight-chain hydrocarbons. Gaseous products primarily comprised unreacted hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane. Based on their research, they recommended optimal conditions for achieving desired results. These were temperatures of 310 °C, pressures of 3 MPa, and time duration of 1 h. Under these conditions, the yields of bio-oil, biogas, and solids were found to be 53.2%, 18.5%, and 12.3%, respectively. Further examination of the hydropyrolysis of seaweed was conducted by [159] . They found that at elevated temperatures, catalytic hydropyrolysis yielded HPO containing an increased quantity of carbon and hydrogen, but decreased levels of nitrogen and oxygen. This implied that catalysts could expedite the deoxygenation and desulfurization of HPO. The heating value of HPO was determined to vary between 35.3 and 29.3 MJ/kg. Yan, Wang, Duan, Wang, Wang, Shi, Xu [138]  extended this line of research by comparing the co-hydropyrolysis of seaweed and used engine oil (UEO) with hydropyrolysis of seaweed alone. Their results highlighted that the oils obtained from the co-hydropyrolysis had a higher hydrogen and carbon content, a superior H/C atomic ratio, and a substantial decrease in heteroatom content and O/C atomic ratio. The oil from the co-hydropyrolysis process also contained reduced concentrations of saturated hydrocarbons and aromatics relative to the oil derived solely from the hydropyrolysis of seaweed.    6.2 Co-pyrolysis of seaweed Co-pyrolysis is a specific approach within the broader domain of pyrolysis that employs two or more types of biomass simultaneously, carefully optimizing the proportions of each. As [160,161]  have demonstrated, the conditions required for co-pyrolysis closely mirror those of its parent process, thus making it an appealing method to be used under similar experimental setups. It enables an in-depth exploration of possible synergies and interactions between multiple materials under inert conditions, which may result in more pronounced impacts [162] . The simplicity of the synthesis procedure, which merely involves blending and mixing, obviates the need for equipment modification. This advantage, in turn, translates into considerable cost savings by avoiding the purchase of new machinery [161] . Furthermore, if the right combination of feedstock is employed, both the quantity and the quality of the bio-oil can be substantially enhanced. While co-pyrolysis can be performed at a technological level without requiring catalysts or solvents [162] , the employment of catalytic or solvent co-pyrolysis to further improve pyrolytic products represents a burgeoning area of research [163] . Seaweed holds immense potential as a biomass source in co-pyrolysis, given that it can be directly co-pyrolyzed with other biomasses and waste materials. For instance, slow co-pyrolysis studies demonstrated negligible differences in bio-oil yields (41–50 wt%) between the oil-rich seaweed Isochrysis  (lipid content 42.8%) and Chlorella  (lipid content 1.1%) [164] . Interestingly, interspecies contact led to a decrease in carboxylic acids, while increasing the production of N-heterocyclic compounds. Also, investigations in China revealed an increase in hydrocarbon yield and a decrease in bio-oil production when tires were added to the co-pyrolysis process with Chlorella [165] . Simultaneously, utilizing oil shale in the process enhanced the yields of hydrocarbons, phenols, and ketones while reducing oxygenate concentrations [166] . In a different experiment, raw sewage scum was co-pyrolyzed with Nannochloropsis, a type of seaweed, the scum being comprised of a diverse array of substances including animal fat, vegetable oil, food scraps, plastic, soap, wax, and other synthetic items [167] . Notably, the seaweed-to-scum ratio considerably influenced the composition of the resultant bio-oil. Also, it was found that adding scum promoted bio-oil and gas production while reducing biochar output. However, a synergistic effect was only achieved with a seaweed to scum ratio of less than 2:1, or when the EHI value of the feedstock exceeded 0.7. Lastly, the co-pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis  sp. with polythene increased the hydrocarbon content of the bio-aliphatic oil to 77.4% for a 25% polythene addition and encouraged the formation of gases like methane [168] . The nitrogen content of the bio-oil was found to be decreased and increased in the solid residues after the co-pyrolysis of three types of seaweed (Nannochloropsis sp ., Spirulina platensis , or Enteromorpha prolifera ) with bamboo wastes, which resulted in the release of ammonia and hydrogen cyanide [169] .   7 Products analysis of seaweed pyrolysis Pyrolysis, a thermochemical decomposition process, facilitates the production of energy-dense biofuels and valuable commodities from organic matter. Both conventional and advanced pyrolysis methods offer such opportunities, enhancing the utility and value of the initial material [170] . Notably, the products of pyrolysis can be obtained in different forms such as solid, liquid, or gas, each with distinct potential applications. These pyrolytic products have found significant usage across diverse sectors, validating their versatility and integral role in industrial processes [170] . Energy production, one of the vital needs of modern society, can benefit significantly from these energy-rich products, potentially mitigating the demand–supply gap in power sectors [171] . In transportation, the need for cleaner, sustainable fuels is crucial for environmental conservation, and here, biofuels obtained from pyrolysis can be game changers. Biofuels not only help reduce our dependency on fossil fuels but also curtail greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing the sector's sustainability [171] . The agricultural sector, too, reaps benefits from pyrolysis. The process can yield biochar, a valuable soil amendment that improves soil fertility and promotes crop growth. Therefore, pyrolysis products can be instrumental in promoting sustainable farming practices [172] . As corroborated by various studies [89,92,173,174] , the range of applications for these pyrolytic products is indeed vast. Consequently, in the following sections, we will delve deeper into each distinct product type obtainable through seaweed pyrolysis, exploring their specific attributes, applications, and potential benefits. 7.1 Solid product Biochar, a dark brown and charred product resulting from the pyrolysis process, is a substance with robust and versatile qualities [175] . Comprising a substantial amount of coke, biochar also features elements such as carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. In addition to these elements, seaweed biochar presents a unique mixture of inorganic components such as potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium. A noteworthy study conducted by [174]  evaluated and compared the biochar derived from microalgae, macroalgae, and lignocellulosic biomass. The research concluded that while the properties of biochar from microalgae mirrored those from macroalgae, they were notably different from those obtained from lignocellulosic biomass. While microalgae biochar surpassed macroalgae in carbon content, it fell short of the carbon content found in lignocellulosic biomass. Biochar has a diverse range of applications due to its inert nature, the presence of functional groups, and its unique ability to capture both liquid and gas molecules [99,107] . Commonly the result of slow pyrolysis, biochar often emerges as a by-product in other types of the process. The energy sector frequently employs biochar as a substrate in gasification processes, to generate energy [176] . Furthermore, recent advances have highlighted biochar's potential as a direct combustion fuel, given its lower carbon dioxide emissions and equal or superior energy content in comparison to fossil fuels [92] . Its solid state simplifies its use as a biofuel, eliminating the need for complex extraction and upgrading procedures required for liquid-based biofuels [177] . Apart from its energy application, biochar, due to its nutrient richness, has found utility in agriculture as a fertiliser and a means of conserving water resources on plantations [178] . To add to the increasing recognition of biochar's potential, [113]  provided evidence that seaweed biochar derived from Chlorella vulgaris possesses an alkaline pH value of 8.1, making it ideal for supplementing agricultural soil. The reduction in the volatile matter fraction of seaweed biochar enables its direct application in coal-fuelled boilers, without the need for conversion. With a higher heating value (HHV) mirroring that of coal (25 MJ/kg), seaweed biochar holds the promise of serving as an alternative energy source. Moreover, the extensive surface area of seaweed biochar signifies its potential as an adsorbent. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed a highly porous and fragmented surface on the biochar, teeming with active binding sites. Consequently, due to its extensive surface area, seaweed biochar is gaining momentum as a promising adsorbent candidate.  7.2 Liquid product Bio-oil, a consequential output of pyrolysis, is a potent liquid energy resource with a distinctive brownish hue and high viscosity. Comprising of a myriad of complex compounds like alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, phenol derivatives, ketones, esters, ethers, sugars, amines, and alcohols [179] , its complex nature represents an intriguing field of study. The particular feedstock employed for bio-oil production introduces additional variability, augmenting the challenge to comprehend its broad spectrum of properties. Notably, bio-oil exhibits distinct physical and chemical properties depending upon the pyrolysis technique deployed—be it slow, fast, catalytic, microwave, or hydro pyrolysis. Despite its complexity, bio-oil is deemed an invaluable renewable energy resource. The unique benefits of bio-oil are manifest in its carbon neutrality—it introduces no nett carbon emissions, reducing environmental impact significantly. Moreover, due to its low nitrogen and sulfur content, the combustion of bio-oil precludes the production of SOX  or NOX [180] , underlining its eco-friendly nature. Structurally, a bio-oil molecule comprises of three separate phases: the organic phase, the aqueous or water-soluble phase, and minuscule solid residues [181] . Generally, the organic phase demonstrates higher energy values compared to the aqueous phase. However, bio-oil, particularly pyrolytic oil, bears certain downsides, such as high viscosity, acidity, and high moieties content, leading to potential degradation over time [182] . Within the category of bio-oils, seaweed bio-oil features high concentrations of aldehydes, ketones, acids, and phenols, as is the case with other biomass-derived pyrolytic bio-oils. These compounds can affect its heating value, thermal stability, and vapour pressure [183–185] . Also, due to its considerable protein content, seaweed bio-oil can contain up to 13% nitrogen [186–188] . However, several issues are associated with seaweed bio-oil, including a high distillate residue, incompatibility with petroleum products, and reactive changes during storage [189,190] . Adamakis, Lazaridis, Terzopoulou, Torofias, Valari, Kalaitzi, Rousonikolos, Gkoutzikostas, Zouboulis, Zalidis [191]  conducted a study on the bio-oil composition for thermal pyrolysis of two sets of Chlorella vulgaris, cultivated in nitrogen-rich or nitrogen-deprived conditions. The results showed that nitrogen-depleted medium conditions yielded the highest lipid content (36% of dry biomass), despite nitrogen-rich media stimulating relatively higher production (1.5 g of dry biomass per litre of media). The bio-oil extracted consisted of a broad spectrum of chemicals, including fatty acids, phenolics, pyrroles, and amides, in varying amounts, dependent on the type of seaweed [142,192,193] . Currently, scientists are studying the commercial potential of bio-oil. While the heating values of seaweed bio-oil are comparable to terrestrial bio-feedstock, its stability and reactivity are hindered due to an increased quantity of oxygen. This raises concerns about corrosiveness and storage difficulties, resulting from elevated levels of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The pyrolysis process also leads to higher nitrogen compound concentrations, causing NOx emissions. At present, the direct use of seaweed bio-oil isn't feasible. Hence, to make it a more reliable and effective energy resource, seaweed bio-oil needs to undergo an upgrading process to eliminate the undesirable components.  7.3 Gas product Syngas, a gaseous by-product of pyrolysis, is produced through the pyrolytic decomposition of seaweed. This decomposition process involves a primary breakdown and secondary cracking of vapours, resulting in the production of two distinct categories of gases[194] . One class consists of condensable gases, which, as the name suggests, can transform into a liquid state upon cooling and further condensation [195] . This conversion creates the liquid product commonly referred to as bio-oil. On the other hand, the second class encompasses gases with low molecular weight such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide [196] . These gases do not condense during the cooling process because their state remains unaffected by temperature variations. Traditionally, the significance of this gas produced during pyrolysis has been undervalued. Nonetheless, recent studies suggest the potential value of this gas product. Seaweed is an attractive feedstock for pyrolysis due to its high moisture content. The water molecules present in seaweed can expedite the gasification of char and reforming of hydrocarbon gas [197] . Advancements in technology, such as microwave-assisted pyrolysis, have enabled the production of high yields of gas products with higher heating values [140] . To provide context, the energy required to heat a kilogram of this gaseous product ranges between 10 and 35 MJ/kg [198,199] . The volume and composition of the resulting syngas are influenced by several factors including the process temperature, residence time, and additives used. One notable advantage of the syngas derived from the pyrolysis process is its versatility compared to its solid and liquid counterparts. It can be directly used as a fuel source in existing boilers, gas turbines, and engines without the need for additional upgrading operations. Table 4   elucidates further by providing a comparison of the physicochemical properties (such as pH, density, and viscosity) and energy content of the solid, liquid, and gaseous products derived from seaweed pyrolysis.   8 Challenges of seaweed pyrolysis and future research directions Seaweed stands out as an excellent alternative to fossil fuels, given its high biomass and oil content coupled with its ease of processing due to the absence of lignin [204] . Despite its apparent potential, the application of seaweed as a feedstock for pyrolysis comes with certain long-standing challenges. Firstly, a low concentration of seaweed biomass in a culture might result in a high-water volume, leading to an increased energy demand during harvesting and drying. Therefore, modifying the cultivation process can augment biomass production while concurrently minimizing energy use. Secondly, high concentrations of minerals and heteroatoms not only contribute to pollution but also reduce the energy density. The issue of heteroatoms could be mitigated through acid washing with HCL, though this process tends to be hazardous, complex, and costly [205] . Further research is thus needed into potentially less harmful alternatives, such as pulsed electric field pre-treatment and bead milling, which can reduce the seaweed's ash content. Thirdly, the low lipid content in seaweed, due to its high protein and starch proportion, results in primarily oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds. The extraction of protein and starch derivatives could be enhanced via bead milling pre-treatment and subsequent catalytic fractional processing [206] . However, the cost of seaweed energy production remains a stumbling block, making it commercially unfeasible unless significantly reduced [204] . For instance, cultivating seaweed can be made more economical through high photosynthetic efficiency microalgae or by utilizing wastewater as a nutrient source. The use of genetically modified seaweed species could also potentially decrease production costs [204,207] . The energy-intensive harvesting process, given seaweeds' composition of small, widely-distributed cells, and the high costs associated with large capacity centrifugation, add to the overall production expenses. A reported 69% of the total energy input is consumed in the dewatering step alone [208] . Moreover, the high moisture content in seaweed, far exceeding the optimal 15–20% for pyrolysis feedstock [209] , necessitates substantial energy inputs to reach an acceptable level. The choice of catalyst for the seaweed pyrolysis process poses another challenge. Zeolites are commonly used for this purpose, although they tend to produce more coke than other alternatives, such as supported metal catalysts and carbon materials [210] . Thus, developing a new generation of catalytic materials that offer enhanced performance and reduced coke formation is crucial. Adjusting the pyrolysis reactor configuration can also improve bio-oil quality, specifically by increasing aromatic yields [211] . Microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis, for instance, shows promise in elevating the proportion of aromatic species in bio-oil, provided an appropriate catalyst, doubling as a microwave receptor, is chosen [205] . The use of high-pressure pyrolysis reactors could also yield higher-quality biocrude from seaweed.  9 Conclusion The pivotal discovery is that seaweeds serve as a promising renewable energy source that can be efficiently converted into high-quality biofuels through catalytic pyrolysis. This process outshines conventional conversion methods by swiftly turning seaweeds into liquid products with minimal carbon dioxide emissions. Catalytic pyrolysis enhances the grade of the bio-oil and selectively produces desirable components, establishing it as an optimal choice for seaweed-based biofuel production. The utilization of seaweeds as a raw material circumvents negative repercussions on food availability, land usage, and the environment, which are commonly associated with conventional biofuels. Utilizing seaweed primarily for energy could impact its traditional food market, potentially driving up prices and risking over-harvesting. While diversifying its use might foster innovations and job opportunities, it's essential to balance its roles in both energy and nutrition to ensure sustainable practices and protect its diverse benefits. This breakthrough holds significant potential to revolutionize the energy sector, though the large-scale commercial implementation necessitates further advancements in technology.
