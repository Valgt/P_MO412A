                  Reliable and affordable energy supply is the key to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) aimed at alleviating poverty. However, few studies explore renewable energy and poverty alleviation (RE-PA) practices and RE-PA nexus from a text mining perspective. This paper aims to find the research concerns of the RE-PA nexus and propose a conceptual framework for the synthesis of renewable energy, poverty alleviation, and SDGs. Topic modelling method and Latent Dirichlet Allocation model were adopted, and 5333 records were obtained from Web of Science and the 12-topic model was used to reveal the latent intellectual structure of the current research on RE-PA nexus. The results suggest that the top research concerns of the RE-PA nexus are sustainable energy development, country resource policy, and economic-environmental-social sustainability. Energy access of rural households, ecosystem services, and renewable energy performance are three essential future research directions. The top research concerns and future research directions would help to further explore the RE-PA nexus. This study could also provide a basis for integrated policy recommendations for renewable energy development and poverty alleviation while pursuing SDGs on energy and poverty.

However, few studies explore renewable energy and poverty alleviation (RE-PA) practices and RE-PA nexus from a text mining perspective. This paper aims to find the research concerns of the RE-PA nexus and propose a conceptual framework for the synthesis of renewable energy, poverty alleviation, and SDGs. Topic modelling method and Latent Dirichlet Allocation model were adopted, and 5333 records were obtained from Web of Science and the 12-topic model was used to reveal the latent intellectual structure of the current research on RE-PA nexus. The results suggest that the top research concerns of the RE-PA nexus are sustainable energy development, country resource policy, and economic-environmental-social sustainability. Energy access of rural households, ecosystem services, and renewable energy performance are three essential future research directions. The top research concerns and future research directions would help to further explore the RE-PA nexus. This study could also provide a basis for integrated policy recommendations for renewable energy development and poverty alleviation while pursuing SDGs on energy and poverty.   Keywords Renewable energy  Poverty alleviation  Sustainable development goals  Policy implications  Solar photovoltaic    1 Introduction Energy is essential for human development and prosperity (González-Eguino, 2015 ; Sarkodie and Adams, 2020 ). It's also an essential factor in overall efforts to achieve sustainable development (IEA, 2020a ). The progress of global efforts to promote electricity access has accelerated, but it is uneven (IEA, 2020b , c ). Worldwide, billions of people still do not have energy services (Wykes et al., 2015 ). Additionally, current patterns of energy production and consumption are unsustainable and threaten the environment (IEA, 2020c ). Energy is also needed for rural household uses, agricultural uses, rural industry uses, as well as an input to water supply, communication, commerce, health, education, and transportation in rural areas (Mahoney et al., 2020 ). However, rural electrification shows a significant challenge in many developing countries. There is an important link between electric energy consumption and human wellbeing (Castro-Sitiriche and Ndoye, 2013 ). The latest World Energy Outlook of the International Energy Agency (IEA) calls for positive measures to bring clean energy to the poor (IEA, 2020c ). The awareness of interconnections between energy systems and social justice (Middlemiss et al., 2019 ) is essential for the mitigation of poverty and climate change, and energy security (Jenkins et al., 2018 ). Access to sustainable and affordable energy services is also a crucial factor for poverty alleviation (Casillas and Kammen, 2010 ; IEA, 2019 ) as well as achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Bhide and Monroy, 2011 ; Evans et al., 2009 ; Leopold et al., 2014 ; Practical Action, 2010 ; United Nations, 2015 ; Wykes et al., 2015 ) in developing countries. The complicated conversion process and the high cost of sustainable and renewable energies are moving the poor away from them (Yao et al., 2021 ). Worldwide, approximately 850 million people lacked access to electricity by 2019 (IEA, 2019 ), and most of them lived in rural areas in developing countries and were trapped in the vicious poverty cycle (Hui and Sanchez, 2012 ; IEA, 2019 ). According to the 1.25 USD per day poverty line, more than three-quarters of the extremely poor are in rural areas (Alkire et al., 2014 ; Olinto et al., 2013 ). The access to clean cooking for the rural poor is also not optimistic (Fig. 1  ). Most rural poor still depend on wood and other biomass fuels as energy sources, which is time-consuming and might cause the lack of access to education and income, and the inability to escape from poverty (Kaygusuz, 2011 ). The rural poor are the most vulnerable to climate change (Chirambo, 2016 ; Khanal et al., 2021 ), and energy access and strengthened livelihoods are important for reducing the vulnerability of the poor (Sawe, 2012 ). Therefore, mitigating climate change, increasing energy access, and alleviating rural poverty could be complementary (Casillas and Kammen, 2010 ; Su et al., 2020 ). In the new phase of development, some developing countries start to pay more attention to pollution control and renewable energy development, with an emphasis on electricity, natural gas, and cleaner, high-efficiency technologies (Grubic et al., 2020 ; IEA, 2019 ; Shuai et al., 2018 ). The energy intensity of a country's economy is often used as an indicator of energy efficiency. For instance, Energy intensity in China and the world continued to decline over the period 1990–2018 (Fig. 2  ). Except the contribution to energy efficiency, China has also made great contributions to poverty reduction worldwide. Under the absolute poverty standard of China, 406.49 million people were lifted out of extreme poverty between 2000 and 2015 (National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China, 2020 ), which is a large contribution to the success of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on poverty elimination. After 2015, China had set the goal of stably achieving poverty eradication under the absolute poverty standard by 2020. From 2015 to 2020, all 55.75 million extreme impoverished people in China had been lifted out of poverty (National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China, 2020 ). To alleviate climate change, increase energy supply, and reduce rural poverty, China is exploring new development models that combine renewable energy with poverty alleviation, such as the Photovoltaic Poverty Alleviation Project (PPAP) (Geall and Shen, 2018 ; NEA, 2016 ; Wu et al., 2019a ; Zhang et al., 2018a ; Zhang et al., 2018b ) and a series of supporting policies (Li et al., 2018 ; NEA, 2016; Zhang et al., 2018a ; Zhang et al., 2019a ). The following projects combine the national economy and energy resources available with rural sustainable development by adopting innovative mechanisms and approaches: the Clean Cookstoves Programme in Ghana, Biogas Programme in Kenya, Rural Energy Development Programme in Nepal, Solar Home Systems (SHS) Programme in South Africa, Rural Grid Electrification Project in Peru, “India Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana Programme (2005–2015)” (Practical Action, 2018 ) and related policies (Bhide and Monroy, 2011 ; Pachauri, 2004 ; Sirohi, 2007 ) in India. The renewable energy and poverty alleviation (RE-PA) explorations could provide a bridge between poverty alleviation and environmental conservation (Zhen et al., 2014 ) and also contribute to several SDGs. Currently, however, the RE-PA practices face challenges, such as renewable-based electrification networks (Bhide and Monroy, 2011 ), technological improvements (Bennion et al., 2015 ), instability, and further political (reduction of subsidy policies) and economic risks (electricity price fluctuation) (Wu et al., 2019a ). The cost of renewable energy systems is usually higher than the income level of the poor significantly, therefore, renewable energies do not have a competitive advantage in terms of costs (Agyekum, 2020 ). In some rural areas, the SHS could meet the lighting demand but not the cooking, making the environmental benefit limited; and the SHS could not meet the demand for direct household production process, making the poverty reduction effect limited (Bhattacharyya, 2006 ; Hamed and Peric, 2020 ). Furthermore, renewable energy projects might not contribute to the poor due to their weak renewable resource base (Mastropietro, 2019 ). Additionally, the market dimensions, i.e. supply, demand, the policy environment, and access to finance, should also be addressed (Practical Action, 2018 ). The challenges also include subjective wellbeing indicators (Castro-Sitiriche and Ndoye, 2013 ), and socio-economic, political, and legal factors, such as the appropriate scale, essential economic incentives, morality, law, and social equality, which would affect individuals’ decisions that directly relate to sustainable development (Zhen et al., 2014 ). Therefore, developing countries need to expand access to sustainable and renewable energy services (Casillas and Kammen, 2010 ; IEA, 2019 ) to address poverty alleviation and pursue SDGs. Current energy systems are inadequate to meet the needs of the poor and the achievement of UN SDGs (IEA, 2019 ). Current research has paid attention to linkages among energies, water, food, climate change, environment and poverty (Chirambo, 2016 ; Jenkins et al., 2018 ; Rasul, 2016 ; Weitz et al., 2014 ; Zhen et al., 2014 ), and systemic SDGs interactions (Pradhan et al., 2017 ). However, there have been few attempts to analyse the energy-poverty nexus (Practical Action, 2010 ) from a text mining perspective to deeply explore the connection between SDGs and RE-PA nexus. Here in this study, a text mining-based model is put forward to explore the RE-PA nexus, and the major research concerns of RE-PA nexus are identified. The potential effects of renewable energy on poverty alleviation are also further discussed from three aspects as follows: socio-economic aspect, environmental aspect, and renewable energy performance aspect. We also put forward a conceptual framework for the synthesis of renewable energy, poverty alleviation, and SDGs. The policy implications for renewable energy development and poverty alleviation are proposed while pursuing sustainable development in developing countries. The potential directions for further RE-PA nexus explorations and further RE-PA practices for decision-making purposes are also emphasised. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2  interprets the topic modelling method and describes data retrieval and data processing. Section 3  reports the overall results of the study and the contents of each topic. Section 4  is the discussion and policy implications of the RE-PA nexus. The conclusions are presented in the final section.  2 Methods and data We used the Web of Science (WOS) as the academic database of this study (Fig. 3  ), which has rich data volume (Harzing and Alakangas, 2016 ) and is highly recognised in academia (Bar-Ilan, 2007 ). In terms of exporting information and comparing across disciplines, the WOS has the characteristics of integrity and stability (Harzing and Alakangas, 2016 ). The major terms we searched in WOS were renewable energy, sustainable energy, and poverty. For comprehensive coverage of relevant literature, the wildcard asterisk (*) was used in the search queries, representing any group of characters, including no character. Specifically, the search information was as follows: “TOPIC: (Renewable* OR Sustainab* AND energy) AND TOPIC: (poverty* OR poor*)”, with the timespan “All years”, the indexes “WOS, CSCD, KJD, MEDLINE, RSCI, SCIELO”, and search language “Auto” (Fig. 3 ). We had obtained 5333 records and the data were last updated on April 17, 2019. To improve the contribution of topic words, some widely used but meaningless words (such as aim, analyse, introduction, result, and discussion), and some words that are not related to the topic (such as the names of publishers: Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley), were added to the list of stop words (Fig. 3 ) (Table S1  in Supplementary material S2). We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to reveal the latent intellectual structure of the current research on RE-PA (Fig. 3 ). LDA is a probabilistic model that describes the generation of a corpus. The basic idea is to treat the document as a mixture of probabilistic topics. The different topics are randomly mixed to form a document, and words in a fixed vocabulary form the characteristics of each topic (Blei et al., 2003 ). LDA can be used to reveal topics used in journal abstracts or the text of entire papers (Blei, 2012 ). It has the advantages of flexibility and coherence, especially in applications where users learn interactively with topics (Stevens et al., 2012 ). Therefore, we employed LDA to discover the main concerns of the RE-PA nexus. More details of the LDA model are reported in Supplementary material S1. To find the fitted number of topics for the LDA model, we computed the approximate perplexity, which is a standard measure of the performance of different models (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004 ). The lower the perplexity score (Equation (5) in Supplementary material S1), the better the generalisation performance (Blei et al., 2003 ). This means that the number of topics with the lowest approximate perplexity is suggested to be a fitted number of topics. Additionally, to make the results concise and meaningful, we used the lemmatisation method (Fig. 3 ) (Supplementary material S3) to “reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form ” (Manning et al., 2008 ). We adopted Python to conduct topic modelling. As a mature open-source machine learning framework, the object-oriented programming method of topic modelling is simple and practical. Among the standard library and third-party library, pyLDAvis (version 2.1.1) and scikit-learn (version 0.17.1) have been used in this study (Fig. 3 ). The visualisation of the topic modelling results was realized by Latent Dirichlet Allocation visualisation (LDAvis) (Chuang et al., 2012 ; Sievert and Shirley, 2014 ). Based on the in-depth analysis of the representative terms of each topic and the most relevant terms of each topic, the LDAvis provides a full view of the topics (Sievert and Shirley, 2014 ). The names of topics are important for the following in-depth analysis. We named the topics based on the terms most highly relevant to each topic visualised by LDAvis (Sievert and Shirley, 2014 ), such as the top ten terms of each topic. After determining the topic modelling results, we conducted the in-depth analysis and discussion, and subsequently proposed policy implications (Fig. 3 ).  3 Results 3.1 Overall analysis The approximate perplexity significantly drops and reaches the bottom firstly when the number of topics is 12 (Fig. S1 ), which suggests that the data are best explained by a model incorporating 12 topics. The topic modelling was conducted and analysed based on the 12 topics model. The top 30 global salient terms of the RE-PA nexus are as follows in descending order: energy, development, poor, production, water, renewable, resource, sustainable, use, fuel, power, environmental, country, technology, biomass, economic, potential, policy, performance, process, change, impact, source, material, rural, cost, effect, emission, right, and different (Fig. 4  ). Additionally, the top 300 global salient terms are shown in Fig. S2  in Supplementary material S4.  3.2 Topics analysis and RE-PA nexus The terms in the red bar (Fig. 5  ) offer a deep inspection of the terms most highly associated with the corresponding topics, which provides the basis for analysing each topic (Sievert and Shirley, 2014 ). Based on the top ten high-frequency terms for each topic of the 12-topic models (Table 1   and Fig. 5 ), the topic names (RE-PA-related research concerns) are identified. The relative proportion of each topic during 1974–2019 ((a) in Fig. 6  ) and the number of every topic in every year from 1974 to 2018 ((b) in Fig. 6 ) were reported. The term “development” ranks highly on the term list of Topic 1, followed by “energy”, “sustainable”, “country”, “policy”, “resource”, “economic”, “environmental”, “social”, and “sustainability” (Table 1  and Fig. 5 ). This shows that sustainable development is closely related to the environment, society, and economy. Topic 2 and Topic 8 address energy issues with the highest frequent term of “energy” (Table 1  and Fig. 5 ). Topic 2 is discussing the issue of renewable energy. The following high-frequency terms also reflect this view: “power”, “renewable”, “electricity”, “wind”, and “solar” (Table 1  and Fig. 5 ). The terms “technology”, “generation”, “cost”, and “grid” are also included (Table 1  and Fig. 5 ), indicating that the generation and cost of renewable energy have also received much attention. Topic 8 discusses energy and fossil fuels, gas, and carbon emissions. Other high-frequency terms related to fuel and gas emissions are as follows: “fuel”, “emission”, “gas”, “biomass”, “carbon”, “fossil”, “CO2 ”, “coal”, and “source” (Table 1  and Fig. 5 ). The high-frequency term for Topic 4 is “water”, which discusses water quality and environmental impact, resource and climate change, energy management and assessment (Table 1  and Fig. 5 ). The term “forest” ranks high on the list of terms in Topic 12, while other terms are as follows: “community”, “ecosystem”, “land”, “local”, “management”, “resource”, “service”, “tree”, and “natural” (Table 1  and Fig. 5 ). It shows that an important issue is the relationship between forest ecosystems and human beings. Several high-frequency terms in Topic 6 are as follows: “production”, “soil”, “crop”, “biomass”, “food”, “yield”, “agricultural”, “land”, “productivity”, and “farmer” (Table 1  and Fig. 5 ), indicating the relationship between food security and sustainable agricultural development. Topic 10 and Topic 11 discuss energy issues in rural households, and Topic 10 mentions building performance and energy efficiency. Topic 11 focuses more on energy access of rural households, including the following terms: “household”, “rural”, “energy”, “income”, “consumption”, “access”, “biogas”, “poverty”, “cooking”, and “use” (Table 1  and Fig. 5 ). The number of every topic in every year and the change in the proportion of topics reflect the hotspots where different topics change over time (Fig. 6 ). The number of the following topics shows a significant increasing trend: Topic 1, 5, 6, 7, and 11 ((b) in Fig. 6 ). The number of other topics is generally on the rise, with a slight decrease in recent years ((b) in Fig. 6 ). Topic 1 held a high proportion and number of all topics from 1997 to 2018 (Fig. 6 ). Although the number of Topic 1 had increased, the proportion of Topic 1 had decreased over time (Fig. 6 ). The proportion of Topic 7 shows a relatively steady growth trend and Topic 4 shows a relatively stable decreasing trend ((a) in Fig. 6 ). During the recent five years (2015–2019), the proportions of Topic 5, 7, 10, 11, and 12 showed increasing trends, and the proportions of Topic 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 showed declining trends ((a) in Fig. 6 ).   4 Discussion 4.1 Major concerns of RE-PA nexus The top research concerns of RE-PA nexus are sustainable energy development, country resource policy, and economic-environmental-social sustainability. Sustainable development relies on environmental, economic, and social sustainable development (Topic 1 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ) (Brundtland, 1985 ; Brundtland and Khalid, 1987 ; Omisore, 2018 ). The research for sustainable development has also highlighted the critical role of energy access (Topic 11 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ) (Bhattacharyya, 2006 ; Castro-Sitiriche and Ndoye, 2013 ; Hui and Sanchez, 2012 ; Kooijman-van Dijk, 2012 ). The proportion of Topic 1 is constantly fluctuating ((a) in Fig. 6 ). We notice that the dominance of Topic 1 seems to drop after 1990 and others are beginning to pick up. The reason for this change might be that since 1990, the poverty and energy issues have been the concerns. The following conferences might arouse interests in renewable energy worldwide: the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, 1992) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992) (United Nations, 1992 ; World Bank, 1992 ). In the context of sustainable development, researchers have become more interested in RE-PA, turning to research-related scattered topics. Improving access to renewable energy (Topic 2 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ) is a fundamental step to poverty alleviation in developing countries (Maiga et al., 2008 ). As the access to energy could help enhance the achievement of the UN SDGs, the renewable and sustainable energies should be considered to address the climate change, environmental conservation, and poverty alleviation issues (Bhide and Monroy, 2011 ). Climate change impacts the ecosystem and makes poor areas suffer livelihood loss, which is the most serious threat to poverty eradication (Topic 4 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ) (Azzarri and Signorelli, 2020 ; Leopold et al., 2014 ). The uncertainty of climate change could increase the occurrence of extreme weather and natural disasters, which affect agricultural production and human life (Topic 3 & 6 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ), thus exacerbating the agriculture and energy challenges (Khanal et al., 2021 ; Liu and Dai, 2020 ; Rasul, 2021 ). Therefore, renewable energy access should not increase the threat from climate change (IEA, 2011 ). Energy mainly involves the following uses: household uses, such as cooking, lighting, and heating (Topic 10 & 11 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ) (Goldemberg, 2000 ); agricultural uses, such as tilling, irrigation, and post-harvest processing; and rural industry uses, such as milling and mechanical energy, and process heat (Topic 6 & 11 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ). The promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency is important for poverty alleviation (Kenfack et al., 2014 ). A low level of education would increase the vulnerability of the livelihoods of the rural poor, threatening sustainable livelihoods (Wang et al., 2016 ). To achieve poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods, it is important to identify the key factors affecting the household livelihoods (Li et al., 2017 ), and needed to find a new way to define and measure energy access (Wykes et al., 2015 ).  4.2 Potential effects of renewable energy on poverty alleviation The potential for renewable energy resources is enormous (Ellabban et al., 2014 ). Energy and environmental experts have started to monitor the effects of energy policies on the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development (Uzar, 2020 ; Vera and Langlois, 2007 ). The overlap of climate change mitigation, energy access increase, and rural poverty alleviation could be defined as the energy-poverty nexus (Casillas and Kammen, 2010 ). Pursuing a sustainable future (Dincer and Acar, 2017 ), renewable and sustainable energy development could benefit the rural poor and their sustainable livelihoods (Kaygusuz, 2011 ), and have impact on socio-economics and environment (Haas et al., 2004 ; Kaygusuz, 2011 ; McGrath, 2014 ). We analysed the potential impact of renewable energy on poverty alleviation from the following three aspects: socio-economic aspect (Topic 1, 3, 6 & 11 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ), environmental aspect (Topic 4, 8, 9 & 12 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ), and renewable energy performance aspect (Topic 2, 5, 7 & 10 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ).(1) Socio-economic aspect    The socio-economic aspect is one of the research hotspots of RE-PA nexus (Topic 1, 3, 6 & 11 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ), which includes the following topics: sustainable energy development (Topic 1), agricultural crop cultivation (Topic 3 & 6), and rural household energy use (Topic 11). The topic of the socio-economic aspect shows increasing trends in number ((b) in Fig. 6 ). Among them, the proportions of topics 1, 3, and 6 show decreasing trends, and the proportion of Topic 11 shows an increasing trend ((a) in Fig. 6 ). It means that in the context of the continuous development of sustainable energy, research has shifted from general topics (Topic 1) to more specific issues (e.g., Topic 11). Specifically, research pays more attention to the energy use of rural households (Topic 11), which is related to poverty (income and consumption), biogas, and cooking use energy. Biomass has been the only available fuel in many rural areas for a long time (Kaygusuz, 2011 ). Insufficient energy supply and power grid facilities might make the energy needs of people living in rural and remote areas unsatisfied (Yadav et al., 2019 ). There is an urgent need to improve the modern energy supply system in rural and remote areas. Renewable energy has a strong correlation with economic well-being at both the national level and the individual level. At the national level, access to clean, modern forms of energy could reduce poverty, encourage economic growth, promote human development, and promote the provision of social services (Hamed and Peric, 2020 ; Huang et al., 2021 ). Additionally, renewable energy could reduce the dependence on coal and oil to a certain extent, alleviate the shortage of energy supply, and thus reduce the energy dependence on other countries (Topic 1) (Huang et al., 2020 ). At the individual level, renewable energy generation and services could enhance the quality of life of the poor, increase economic productivity and directly reduce poverty (Huang et al., 2020 ; Terrapon-Pfaff et al., 2014 ). In rural areas, renewable energy could be widely used in rural production and life (Topic 11). For instance, solar energy could provide hot water for homes, and bioenergy (such as biogas) could provide fuel for cooking food. The transition to cleaner renewable energy could help reduce household expenditures and improve family living standards (Boemi and Papadopoulos, 2019 ). Agriculture is the most important economic sector in many developing countries. Agricultural production, machine operation, and crop irrigation all require energy support (Topic 3 & 6). The clean energy obtained through hydroelectric power generation could also provide power for agricultural activities. Therefore, as a sustainable energy source, renewable energy could help reduce poverty in rural areas. The main types of renewable energies are solar, wind, hydro, sustainable biomass, and geothermal (Wu et al., 2018a ). China has combined solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation with poverty alleviation and constructed solar PV stations in poor areas. There are two main models of the PPAP, which aim to lift impoverished families out of poverty by providing clean energy or distributing subsidies (Bai et al., 2021 ). The first model is the distributed solar PV power station, such as a miniature solar PV power station on their roof. In this PPAP model, poor families could use electricity generated by their own solar PV power station, while sell the excess PV electricity to the State Grid to obtain income (Li et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). The second model is the centralised solar PV power station, such as a large-scale solar PV power station near the village. In this PPAP model, poor families could obtain subsidies that come from the sale of electricity generated by centralised solar PV power stations to the State Grid (Liao et al., 2021 ). The subsidies would be at the disposal of the village collective with an annual minimum standard of 3000 RMB (428 USD) per family through different channels (Liao et al., 2021 ). Poor families who are unable to work (disability or elderly) would receive subsidies directly, while poor families who can work would receive subsidies by working in the centralised solar PV power station (Liao et al., 2021 ). Additionally, the revenue of solar PV power generation could also develop the village collective economy. Therefore, the PPAP has realised the combination of renewable energy and poverty alleviation.(2) Environmental aspect    Another research focus of the RE-PA nexus is environmental aspect (Topic 4, 8, 9 & 12 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ). According to the results, the main focuses of the environmental aspect are as follows: water quality and environmental impact (Topic 4), resource and climate change (Topic 4), fossil fuel combustion (Topic 8 & 9), carbon emissions (Topic 8), and ecosystem services (Topic 12). We find that the proportions of Topics 4, 8, and 9 show decreasing trends, and the proportion of Topic 12 shows an increasing trend ((a) in Fig. 6 ). It means that research has shifted from considering the single energy-environment relationship (Topic 4, 8 & 9) to comprehensively considering the coordinated development of nature-human links and interactions (Topic 12). More specifically, the following research has received more and more attention: forest ecosystem, ecosystem services, local community, natural resource, and land management, while attention to issues such as water quality and environmental impact, fossil energy and the environment have declined. Emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels are major contributors to the unpredictable effects of climate change, urban air pollution, and acidification of land and water (Topic 8 & 9) (IEA, 2019 ). Global policies generally encourage efforts to promote the transition to a low-carbon economy (Scorza et al., 2020 ), carbon emissions peak, and carbon neutrality (Shan et al., 2021 ). However, a single energy-environmental study is no longer sufficient to ensure the needs of sustainable development (Topic 4, 8 & 9). Developing renewable energy and minimising the impact on the environment are the most essential challenges. The trend of RE-PA research to the ecosystem service system illustrates this problem. Ecosystem services are provided to humans by ecosystems, which are the foundation of human life (Alcamo et al., 2003 ). There is an essential link between ecosystem services and the multi-dimensions of poverty. The benefits that people get from the ecosystem have a direct relationship with well-being (Fisher et al., 2013 ; Suich et al., 2015 ). Especially suitable for related natural resources, such as water, land, and forests. The adverse effects of traditional energy threaten the poor people who depend on the ecological environment for their livelihoods (Azzarri and Signorelli, 2020 ). From the perspective of families, the harmful gases (such as carbon monoxide and formaldehyde) produced by the combustion of traditional energy (such as wood and charcoal) would not only cause air pollution in the living environment, but also endanger the health of the family members. However, the expansion of renewable energy also poses a threat to ecological services. For instance, water shortages, water conflicts, and the deterioration of river ecosystems caused by hydroelectric power transfer; solar and wind energy have intensified land use, which undoubtedly leads to conflicts between food production and farmers’ interests. It might also be one of the reasons why renewable energy has good environmental benefits while energy infrastructure has suffered local opposition. Therefore, the consideration of renewable energy and poverty reduction should not be isolated, but to maximise the common benefits of multiple ecosystem services.(3) Renewable energy performance aspect    The proportion of topics related to renewable energy performance aspect (Topic 2, 5, 7 & 10 in Table 1  and Fig. 5 ) shows increasing trends (Fig. 6 ). It shows that the current research has explored the potential challenges of renewable energy in power technology and power generation costs as follows: batteries, materials, construction technology, design, and energy-saving. These topics indicate that it is not enough to just pay attention to the clean power provided by renewable energy for poverty reduction, and the renewable energy performance is also important and could not be ignored. The transition to sustainable development requires investment in renewable energy technologies (Topic 5 & 7), especially the key-material (Klimenko et al., 2021 ) and battery stability (Liu et al., 2021 ). Considering economic situation of the poor, the cost is an inevitable issue (Topic 2). Without considering the environmental factors, most renewable energy generation systems have the characteristics of high investment, low operation and maintenance costs, and zero fuel cost (Yao et al., 2021 ). Clarifying cost constraints is of great significance for future research and decision optimization (Shen et al., 2020 ). There is still room for the improvement in power generation efficiency and project performance of PPAP that have received much attention (Wu et al., 2018b , 2019a ). The efficiency of renewable energy utilisation is also worthy of further exploration (Topic 10). Energy efficiency plays a crucial role in accelerating the transition to clean energy and achieving global climate and SDG (IEA, 2020a ). Current research is pursuing the efficient role of renewable energy in poverty alleviation, aiming to build a low-carbon, safe, and efficient renewable energy system (Wu et al., 2018b ). Renewable energy storage technology, configuration optimization, design and site selection, and investment options have all received attention (Wu et al., 2019b , 2019c ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Compared with traditional energy, renewable energy is a competitive energy source because of its environmental credentials, and it will remain for a long time. Therefore, further development of RE-PA still faces challenges, which are renewable energy technologies, cost, and efficiency.  4.3 Synthesis of renewable energy, poverty alleviation, and SDGs Each topic seems to highlight the RE-PA nexus from a different perspective, and it is necessary to link these research topics. Integrated with the nature-human links and interactions (Barfuss et al., 2018 ; Laband et al., 2012 ; Schleicher et al., 2018 ), energy indicators for sustainable development (Streimikiene et al., 2007 ; Vera and Langlois, 2007 ), environment-poverty nexus (Cheng et al., 2018a ; Dasgupta et al., 2005 ; Duraiappah, 1996 ; Jalal, 1993 ; Lufumpa, 2005 ; Reardon and Vosti, 1995 ; Uitto, 2016 ), multi-dimensions of poverty (Alkire and Foster, 2011 ; Alkire and Santos, 2010 ; Liu et al., 2017 ; Sen, 1981 , 2009 ; United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 1990 –2010), considering the global benefits of renewable energies production (Ellabban et al., 2014 ; IEA, 2017 ) and the major topics we concluded (Table 1 ), this study proposes a conceptual framework for the synthesis of renewable energy, poverty alleviation, and SDGs (Fig. 7  ). The global benefits of renewable energy generation and production (Ellabban et al., 2014 ; IEA, 2017 ), the topics (Table 1 ) and the environment-poverty nexus (Cheng et al., 2018a ; Dasgupta et al., 2005 ; Duraiappah, 1996 ; Jalal, 1993 ; Lufumpa, 2005 ; Reardon and Vosti, 1995 ; Uitto, 2016 ), as well as the links between ecosystem services and poverty alleviation (Fisher et al., 2014 ; Reyers and Selomane, 2018 ; Suich et al., 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2018c , 2018d , 2019b ), provide the linkages between renewable energy and poverty alleviation from multi-dimensions. Renewable energy has played an important role in environmental protection, economic society, and poverty reduction. Energy affects air (Topic 8 & 9 in Table 1 ), forests (Topic 12 in Table 1 ), land (Topic 6 in Table 1 ), water (Topic 4 in Table 1 ), and other environmental factors, which in turn affect poverty (Topic 1 in Table 1  and ④ in Fig. 7 ). Climate change, forest and land destruction, water pollution, and other factors affect food production, agricultural land, production, and domestic water use, which threaten human livelihoods, thereby exacerbating poverty. The development and use of renewable energy are the keys to protecting the environment and reducing poverty. Major renewable energy sources include wind, marine, solar, hydro, geothermal energy, and bioenergy (Topic 2 & 6 in Table 1  and ⑤ in Fig. 7 ), and the current research mainly paid attention to the wind and solar energy when concerned RE-PA nexus (Topic 1 & 2 in Table 1 ) (Ellabban et al., 2014 ; IEA, 2020c ). Renewable energy affects global benefits in terms of politics, environment, society, technology, and economy, and thus affects all aspects of human life (⑥ in Fig. 7 ). In terms of the politics, it is conducive to create actors in a renewably powered future, and build power and action (Topic 1 & 12 in Table 1 ). Environmentally, it would reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase environmental values and behaviours (Topic 8 & 9 in Table 1 ). Socially, it affects local ownership and decision-making, community building, and empowerment. Technically, it is beneficial to realise energy self-sufficiency, industry development and technologies upgrading of renewable energy, and renewable energy education and training (Topic 2, 5 & 7 in Table 1 ). Economically, it has a positive impact on shareholder income, community income, local jobs, community assets, regional development, and income diversification. There are links between modern energy access and economic development (Kooijman-van Dijk, 2012 ). Lack of access to energy services, the resilience to shocks of the poor caused by environmental degradation and climate change would decrease, which would make it difficult to attain the poverty eradication goal (IEA, 2019 ; Leopold et al., 2014 ). Therefore, the link between ecosystem services and poverty alleviation needs to be understood and managed. Ecosystem services act on health, education, services, assets, resources, and income (Topic 10, 11 & 12 in Table 1  and ⑦ in Fig. 7 ), and these factors are also important dimensions for alleviating poverty (⑧ in Fig. 7 ). Human dependence on energy and multi-dimensional poverty factors also increase the burden on ecosystems. Reliable and affordable access to energy is fundamental to achieving poverty eradication, sustainable rural development (Kooijman-van Dijk, 2012 ), and broader sustainable development (Topic 1 in Table 1  and ⑨ & ⑩ in Fig. 7 ) (Leopold et al., 2014 ). To achieve this long-term goal successfully, it is necessary to establish a series of energy indicators that meet renewable energy and SDG (③ in Fig. 7 ). They include equity, health, use and production patterns, security, atmosphere, water, and land. Based on the nested sustainable development view (Giddings et al., 2002 ), the economy depends on society, and the economy and society both depend on the environment (② in Fig. 7 ) (Giddings et al., 2002 ). The development of renewable energy reflects the nature-human connection and interaction (① in Fig. 7 ), and the combination of renewable energy and poverty alleviation is an important way to achieve SDG (② in Fig. 7 ).  4.4 Implications and future research The conceptual framework for the synthesis of renewable energy, poverty alleviation, and SDGs would help strengthen the energy-poverty-sustainability interconnection and coordinated development (④ in Fig. 7 ). It means that researchers should continue to pay attention to the research on RE-PA nexus. As the primary topic on the relationship between renewable energy and the environment, the number of Topics 1 is still increasing. It is worth noting that although the proportion of Topic 1 shows a decreasing trend from 1992 to 2013, it shows an increasing trend in the past five years. According to research hotspots and trends, we could predict the focus areas of future research. In the context of sustainable development, sustainable energy development, and country resource policy, economic-environmental-social sustainability would still be the main research topics in the RE-PA nexus in the next few years (① & ② in Fig. 7 ). We find an increasing trend in the following topics of RE-PA nexus: energy access of rural households, ecosystem services, and renewable energy performance. Global climate change urgently requires minimising the human impact on the environment and achieving the goal of reducing carbon emissions (Mikulčić et al., 2021 ). Therefore, topics of sustainable energy development are developing in a more specific, comprehensive, and coordinated direction. Furthermore, scholars and policymakers should give priority to the following research and practices:(1) Energy access of rural households (relate to Topic 1, 3, 6 & 11). In most countries, energy transformations of rural electricity grids are determined nationally and focus more on urban than rural areas. It means that the unbalanced structure of energy consumption in rural areas has not received attention, and the development of renewable energy in rural areas is still facing challenges (Mikulčić et al., 2021 ; Ojong, 2021 ). Considering environmental conservation and climate change mitigation, more efforts should be put into the pursuit of sustainable development of energy and poverty alleviation in rural areas (⑨ & ⑩ in Fig. 7 ). Different stakeholder groups have different focusses on renewable energy applications (⑥ in Fig. 7 ). It is recommended to consider the livelihood vulnerability of the rural poor and coordinate the conflicts of interest among farmers, government, and society (⑥ in Fig. 7 ). Considering the economic situation in rural areas, institutional frameworks should be improved and financing mechanisms should be developed to encourage private sector investments in the construction of rural renewable energy infrastructure (Fig. 7 ).  (2) Ecosystem services (relate to Topic 4, 8, 9 & 12). Another challenge of current research is the coordinated development of nature-human, that is, the coordinated and sustainable development of electricity, construction, forestry, agriculture, and ecosystems services (①, ②, ④ & ⑦ in Fig. 7 ) (Mikulčić et al., 2021 ). Since the early solar energy development occupied agricultural land, the sustainable use of solar energy conflicts with the ecosystem service system (Adeh et al., 2019 ; Hernandez et al., 2019 ). It is recommended to consider the promotion of multi-functional land use to improve various ecosystem services and increase the compatibility of renewable energy and poverty reduction (④ in Fig. 7 ).  (3) Renewable energy performance (relate to Topic 2, 5, 7 & 10). Although the existing renewable energy technologies (such as solar PV, wind energy, and hydropower) have gradually matured, the application and deployment of renewable energy are still restricted by national and regional policies (De Rosa and Castro, 2020 ). It is necessary to make more efforts to research and innovate the performance of renewable energy. The energy efficiency of rural energy utilisation should be improved, especially promoting energy-saving technologies in rural buildings and stoves (③ in Fig. 7 ). Energy indicators should be combined to monitor the performance of renewable energy (③ in Fig. 7 ). The complementarity of different renewable energies, such as solar energy and wind energy, should also be considered (⑤ in Fig. 7 ).      5 Conclusion Renewable energy is essential to meet basic social needs and promote human development, especially for the poor. This study provides a text-mining perspective to help understand the current focus of academic attention on RE-PA nexus and how the topics evolve. This study analysed RE-PA nexus and major research concerns as well as the potential effects of renewable energy on poverty alleviation by using the topic modelling and systematic review methods. This study also put forward a conceptual framework for the synthesis of renewable energy, poverty alleviation and SDGs. The determination of research focus would help solve the dilemma of RE-PA. It also helps future policymaking both for research priorities and development practice. This study would advance the review of the RE-PA nexus, with special attention to the future development of the relationship between RE-PA and SDGs. Renewable energies occupy an important place in strategies for climate change mitigation, poverty reduction, and sustainable development. Based on these topic results and analyses, we find that the top research concerns of RE-PA nexus are sustainable energy development, country resource policy, and economic-environmental-social sustainability. Additionally, we propose three key future research directions: energy access of rural households, ecosystem services, and renewable energy performance, such as cooking use energy of rural households, natural resource and land management, and power technology and cost. These key future research directions aim to realise the coordination of humans and ecosystems as well as explore efficient renewable energy systems. Due to the limitations of current cross-linguistic text mining and analysis techniques, this study cannot temporarily realise the simultaneous analysis of multilingual texts. If the cross-language simultaneous analysis is needed, other language texts need to be translated into a certain type of text and then unified. The existing automatic translation technology is not mature enough to accurately implement the translation function, hence there are deficiencies in cross-language text analysis. Therefore, this study only analysed the literature in English and made up for deficiencies through in-depth literature analysis. When the cross-linguistic text mining and analysis techniques become mature in the future, relevant research could consider simultaneous text mining and in-depth analysis of relevant studies of different languages. The comprehensive use of text mining and machine learning should also be considered. For a specific region, a questionnaire survey or in-depth interviews could be conducted to obtain local feature information to enhance analysis. Further explorations should be continued to provide theoretical support for the coordinated development of the poor and the environment, and sustainable development.
