                  Before the COVID-19 crisis, Thailand’s tourism industry, which is critical to the economy, relied on global tourists. The Thai government initiated a policy reform to stimulate domestic focus on the agricultural sector as the key occupation for income distribution, which involved changing tourist behavior from urban to local tourism. This study integrates quantitative and qualitative multiphase approaches to obtain reliable research results from six regions of Thailand. The travel behaviors of Thai tourists engaged in agritourism did not show a statistically significant difference. The paradigm was intercorrelated with variables of the entry mode, comprising internal and external factors that influence the decision to enter the agritourism business. An agritourism entrepreneur must perceive risks and benefits, and adjust and return to the homecoming of offspring. Thailand’s agritourism can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), resulting in economic growth based on sustainable domestic dependency.

Before the COVID-19 crisis, Thailand’s tourism industry, which is critical to the economy, relied on global tourists. The Thai government initiated a policy reform to stimulate domestic focus on the agricultural sector as the key occupation for income distribution, which involved changing tourist behavior from urban to local tourism. This study integrates quantitative and qualitative multiphase approaches to obtain reliable research results from six regions of Thailand. The travel behaviors of Thai tourists engaged in agritourism did not show a statistically significant difference. The paradigm was intercorrelated with variables of the entry mode, comprising internal and external factors that influence the decision to enter the agritourism business. An agritourism entrepreneur must perceive risks and benefits, and adjust and return to the homecoming of offspring. Thailand’s agritourism can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), resulting in economic growth based on sustainable domestic dependency.   Keywords Innovation  Tourism  Agritourism  COVID-19 pandemic  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction Thailand, a country in Southeast Asia, relies on tourism and related industries, including the hospitality industry, which encompasses travel and tourism, entertainment and recreation, hotels, food and beverage, retail, and transportation. The hospitality industry affects the trade and investment within and across countries in the global value chain system, accounting for 12 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) dedicated to domestic economic development (Kokkaew, 2015; Chancharat & Meeprom, 2021 ). This is critical for tourism-dependent economies, such as Thailand, because the tourism sector and related businesses from the upstream, midstream, and downstream areas ban foreign tourists from traveling around the country. The Bank of Thailand forecasted that Thailand would lose worth 2.5 billion by 2020. The declining number of Chinese tourists has had a major impact on the Thai economy, specifically the drop in Chinese tourists impacted the Thai economy’s relying international tourists. The COVID-19 pandemic forced Thai people to modify and adapt their behaviors to a “New Normal“ lifestyle, or a new way of life (UNDP and UNICEF, 2020 ; Bank of Thailand, 2020 ; Ridzuan & Abd Rahman, 2021; Gössling & Schweiggart, 2022 ). From the viewpoint of the international community, Thailand is renowned as a world-famous tourism. Both in terms of scenery and diversity of tourist attractions, Thailand is a combination of natural and cultural aspects; therefore, the tourism industry has historically played a dynamic vital role in the economy of Thailand (Buhalis et al., 2023; Songsivilai, 2023 ). The behavior of tourists in Thailand has changed and tourists are now preferring to travel more locally, as the trend of global population continues to expand and strain our natural resources. Its impact on population growth extends beyond the large urban centers, being concentrated worldwide and Thailand is also affected (Fakfare et al., 2022; Fakfare & Sangpikul, 2022; Sann et al., 2023 ). The rural, agricultural countryside, and small towns that support such villages are changing, with tourism being one of the leading and more visible agents of agriculture that has been shaping the beautiful countryside for hundreds of years (Nugin & Pikner, 2023; Pham et al., 2023 ). The country is changing because of contemporary developments and dynamics closely related to pastoral traditions. The main economic activity is no longer the case (Ancuța & Jucu, 2023; Chen & Pow, 2023 ). Agriculture, the only primary economic driver of most rural communities, is shifting to alternative goods and services, developing rural communities, and fostering market demand for alternatives such as organic farming, natural farming, conservation, and tourism in the countryside and general public to. Agriculture comprises different rural economic models, and the quality of the countryside attracts visitors, prompting a request to enjoy nature and a harmonious way of life (Brune et al., 2023; Nelson et al., 2023 ). The combination of agriculture and tourism may increase household income, tax income, and employment opportunities, minimizing the impact of economic leakage and reducing social problems; however, the possible effects are varied and complex. Therefore, it is essential to link consequences to the process of change. In other words, the mechanism of agritourism reform must be further explored (Wu, 2018 ). Pérez-Olmos and Aguilar-Rivera (2021)  have explained agritourism in the context of sustainable local development, which is a farmer's business that operates on farms to provide enjoyment, knowledge, and new experiences based on the responsibility and consciousness of preserving the environment for tourist attractions. Agrotourism has been defined as directly being open to tourists through physical agricultural activities that create opportunities and income for farmers and farmland owners (Phillip et al., 2010 ). However, what the author has attempted to write about is not as easy as it seems. The changing world trends have transformed local agriculture into business agriculture, defined as agritourism. The word “business” is involved because, in from the past, farmers only relied on knowledge from agriculture, but now they need to acquire interdisciplinary learning, which is very challenging in Thailand (Ohe, 2023 ). As previously mentioned, we construct and develop a transformation paradigm (Vasile et al., 2017 ). In our literature review of the agritourism sector in a business context, the preliminary data show that the parameters of agritourism are complex and correlated (Srikatanyoo & Campiranon, 2010 ). Changing the mindset of farmers is challenging. Rural farmers often poor, lack agribusiness skills, and reside in remote areas (White, 2012 ). They adopt agritourism as an income distribution strategy across all regions and for the sustainable development of Thailand’s tourism industry (Promkhambut et al., 2023 ). On average, most of the country's farmers have no business skills and subsequently require knowledge (Srikatanyoo & Campiranon, 2010; Hjalager et al., 2016 ) of tourist behavior on the demand side and its correlational relationship with entrepreneurship on the supply side as a value chain, which also requires knowledge of investment. (Hjalager et al., 2016; Brandano et al., 2018 ). These include ownership characteristics, location (Wu et al., 2022 ), internalization (Adinugraha & Sartika, 2022 ), and the crucial factor of financial status (Adhikari & Khanal, 2023 ), which is an internal factor at the macroeconomic level (Fanelli & Romagnoli, 2022 ). The next aspect is turning farms into business enterprises using value (Colton & Bissix, 2005 ), rarity (Suess-Reyes & Fuetsch, 2016 ), imitability (Sumardi et al., 2021 ), and organization (Paniccia & Baiocco, 2020 ). Regarding external factors at the macroeconomic level (Feher et al., 2022 ), farmers need to know about politics and government policies (Srisomyong & Meyer, 2015 ), economic conditions (Chin & Pehin Dato Musa, 2021 ), socio-cultural factors (Mansfeld & Jonas, 2006 ), technology (Rich et al., 2011 ), environment (Zhao et al., 2022 ), and legal factors (Endres et al., 2023 ), including elements related to external factors at the micro level. This is known as a market system (Gold et al., 2004 ). When combined, these factors form the body of knowledge used to make investment decisions. If you decide to invest, you can invest in an agritourism business and utilize innovation to attract tourists. It sounds like this is challenging for farmers in general. This research examines the evolution of agrotourism's connection to agricultural change and the survival of traditional small farms, which is a part of sustainable rural development. The cross-disciplinary literature informs it on rural development. Particularly, multipurpose agriculture and multi-markets are complex and ever-changing landscapes. Innovations are emerging in the agricultural sector, struggling to survive global free-trade policies and neoliberalism (Kim & Jamal, 2018 ). Rural tourism is not easy because it is business-oriented and includes the process of “developing” tourism step by step. This coincides with the nested marketplace in the rural farming domain, where farmers, residents, and visitors use historical practices and cultural knowledge to innovate. Quality products and educational experiences contribute to the sustainability of the local agricultural lifestyles and cultural traditions. However, the changing roles of the government, structural changes in growth, and hegemony of farming cooperatives have increased tensions and apparent conflicts within communities in the struggle for rural survival (Priatmoko et al., 2023 ). The difference between “agritourism” and “innovative agritourism” is crucial to know about; it implies the difference between traditional agritourism and innovative agritourism. Previously, most research has focused on alleviating poverty and rural development in traditional agritourism. However, the pace of agritourism's growth has been delayed because of farmers' willingness and ability to establish. The concept of innovation in agritourism is growing, and the sustainability of agritourism is being emphasized. As seen in the non-agricultural economy, innovation in agritourism triggers sustainable development in rural areas through agricultural farm modernization. This can involve developing an original tourist product at a destination, integrating the required services, and promoting the product. Innovative agritourism projects include firm infrastructure, human management, resource procurement, and technological development. Innovation in agritourism is essential to develop competitiveness among tourism enterprises and tourist areas. Reviewing the literature on agritourism directs farm diversification and guides the integration of tourists’ products as a compound product in a destination by comparing the best practices of agritourism at successful destination. Moreover, it contributes to innovation in agritourism (Bhatta & Ohe, 2020 ; Ammirato et al., 2018; Polukhina & Rukomoinikova, 2018; Bhatta & Ohe, 2020; Ammirato et al., 2020; Pérez-Olmos & Aguilar-Rivera, 2021 ). We try to categorize the five eras of the old agricultural paradigm transformation into a new paradigm shift, namely, the lack of information-sharing; native farmers still hesitate to share information and put themselves at a disadvantage in learning new techniques for solving farming problems (Gosnell et al., 2019 ). First, a more recent cultural learning model developed in the country involves disinterest in agriculture. It is uncertain whether this model is derived from the government’s obvious disinterest or from parents’ disinterest being passed on to their children (Hepburn, 2010 ). The notion of rural development has emerged through socio-political discussions surrounding agriculture and the countryside; it significantly shows the final expropriation of farmers revitalizing agriculture (Piore & Sabel, 1984; Harrison, 1994 ). In the second era, we must consider that agritourism as rural development is a new developmental model for the agricultural sector. It includes scale enlargement, intensification, specialization, and, within some sectors, a strong trend toward industrialization. These are the parameters that circumscribe developments in the agricultural sector. There is a decline in farm numbers, migration for gaining employment in the capital, and a sharp drop in the employment outcome of this model. Additionally, regional disparities have increased, and tensions have grown in terms of landscape farming, nature, environment, and product quality (Meyer and Staggenborg, 1996 ). Creating cohesive activities between different farms or other rural activities appears to be a crucial for introducing strategic elements and synergies among local and regional eco-systems (Guzmán-Casado et al., 2000 ). This includes introducing specific farm styles, specific goods and services, localized food chains, specific social carriers, developing mutual paradigm benefits, and creating “win–win situations” resulting from different strategic activities (van der Ploeg and Saccomandi, 1995 ). Third, rural development can be operationalized at the level of individual farm households. At this level, rural development emerges as the redefinition of identities, strategies, practices, interrelations, and networks. Fundamentally, it is a historically rooted but marginalized cultural repertoire that is based on highly “market-oriented” responses embodying the context of the new ties emerging between towns and the countryside. The issue of synergy reappears as the extent to which conditions combined in a rural enterprise positively affect costs, benefits, risks, and prospects. This includes the coordination and allocation of family labor in different agricultural and non-agricultural activities in a proactive farm household. Fourth, the agritourism paradigm is defined at the levels of the inter-relationship between society and agriculture and the countryside as a well-defined social and geographical space where new forms of articulation are to be developed (Lowe et al., 1995 ). The “rural” is no longer the monopoly of farmers. Within the framework, coordination, and conflict management mechanisms become increasingly important as new forms of farm-based rural development activities emerge and different actors compete for access to opportunities and resources, such as rural tourism and, nature and landscape conservation, wildlife reserves. While farmer organizations strive for farmer-managed landscapes and nature values, non-agricultural landowners, such as rural dwellers and “hobby farmers,” play a key role in the management of nature and landscape (Primdahl, 1999 ). Fifth, is the level of policy and institutions. There is considerable variation in the development policies among leaders at different national and regional levels. This involves emerging practices related to specific rural development programs. Interactions with non-specific rural development policies are sometimes more important for their development. Additionally, each country offers a different institutional setting for producing, transforming, and marketing agricultural goods and services that may be favorable for rural development (Banks & Marsden, 2000 ). There are the following three aspects to be dealt with in terms of different policies: synergy-specific regional constellations and the effects of particular institutional settings on the processes involved in rural development. The new paradigm involves the complex institutional setting of rural development, which makes it a multifactorial process. The drive toward a decentralized rural policy approach (Ray, 2000 ), in which locality and the newly emerging relations between the local and global are major design principles, may serve to strengthen the process. However, there have been several recent studies (Shucksmith, 2000 ). Within rural development, mechanisms of social exclusion also occur, and policy programs are sometimes used by local elites to restore their legitimacy or in the interests of clientelism. The new paradigm is the complex institutional setting of rural development, which makes it a multifactorial process. It entails the drive toward a decentralized rural policy approach (Ray, 2000 ) in which local and global relations are newly emerging. Agricultural mechanisms of social exclusion also occur, and policy programs are sometimes used by local elites to restore their legitimacy or in the interests of clientelism. Finally, multi-faceted in nature, it unfolds into practices that are sometimes interconnected: landscape management, conservation of new natural values, agritourism, organic farming, and production of high-quality and region-specific products. Other activities increasingly adopted by family farms include innovative forms for direct cost-reduction and marketing. Involvement in enterprises results in new forms of social cohesion, and in many cases, various activities are integrated into farm enterprises and different segments of the urban population. A multi-level process rooted in historical traditions has emerged at all levels as a series of responses to the modernization paradigm. The new rural development paradigm replaces the modernization paradigm that once dominated policy, practice, and theory. Particularly, several scholars have noted that the ongoing crisis may play a transformative role and contribute to a paradigm shift and new mindset regarding sustainability in agritourism (Sigala, 2020; Gössling et al., 2020 ). This study offers possibilities for a new form of “local tourism experiences” that can lead to sustainable rural development and is linked with the international themes of empowerment, regulation, understanding, market, and product development in rural tourism after the COVID-19 crisis (Magno & Cassia, 2021 ). Therefore, considering the agritourism business paradigm, these factors must be examined in Thailand (Sroka et al., 2023; Ohe, 2023; Priatmoko et al., 2023 ). 1.1 Development of an agritourism business paradigm A business paradigm is a pattern of variables that significantly change the leadership’s vision to create value for integrated decision-making and achieve various sustainability goals related to business success and profitability (Giacalone & Eylon, 2000 ). As the first paradigm, we find that tourist behavior has an intercorrelated positive relationship with the characteristics of agritourism entrepreneurs, representing the fundamentals of Thailand's tourism (González et al., 2007; Lordkipanidze et al., 2005 ). Accordingly, we construct “Proposition 1 ″ based on the 5As framework to measure tourists’ satisfaction levels with the domestic tourism elements (Dickman, 1996 ). The tourism demand-side includes variables related to tourist behavior, such as attractions, accessibility, amenities, accommodations, and activities (Ageeva & Foroudi, 2019 ). The value chain is a tool (Porter, 2001 ) used to understand the link between tourism and agriculture for the participatory development of farmers, especially in developing countries (Ashley & Mitchell, 2009; Lacher & Nepal, 2010; Mugo et al., 2022 ). Next, we measure the “supply-side” of domestic tourism (Weiermair, 2000 ). The value chain represents farmers' knowledge of tourist behavior obtained through inter-the sectoral links among the production processes integrated into economic sectors for accelerating the productivity and development of agritourism, which is reflected in the characteristics of agritourism entrepreneurs (Ashley & Mitchell, 2009; Lacher & Nepal, 2010; Van der Duim et al., 2011; Richards & Font, 2019 ). According to Zhang and Hu (2011) , the implication of the intercorrelation between tourists’ behaviors and characteristics of tourist operators indicates that tourist behavior affects the characteristics of a tourism entrepreneur and; consequently, an agritourism entrepreneur’s characteristics also affect tourist behavior.Proposition 1 Tourist behavior (demand-side) correlates with agritourism entrepreneurs’ characteristics (supply-side), thereby affecting farmers’ decision-making.    Sangnak et al. (2021)  and Sangnak and Tresirichod (2022)  have proposed a set of merging functions based on the OLI factors of ownership (O), location (L), and internationalization (I) (Dunning, 2001 ) with financial statements (F). It is an essential instrument for chief executive officers’ (CEO) investment decisions to fall within the OLIF framework (Cleary, 1999 ). We use the phrase “internal micro factors” to represent the OLIF framework, which is a tool that assesses internal resource relationships with macroeconomics to deliver products and services for creating a competitive advantage (Sangnak et al., 2021; Sangnak & Tresirichod, 2022 ).Proposition 2 Internal macro factors affect the investment decisions of farmers pursuing agritourism.    Barney and Wright (1998)  have proposed the VRIO framework as a function to examine the role of internal resources. It includes the aspect valuable (V), to identify uniqueness, rare (R) as the level of resource rarity, imitable (I) to indicate when a resource is scarce and expensive to occupy, and organization (O), which indicates the strategic management of available assets. The VRIO framework describes the internal resources at the micro level of the agritourism economic system (Astawa & Suamba, 2021 ). We use the phrase “internal micro factors” to represent the VRIO framework as a set of internal resources that relate to microenvironments (Sangnak et al., 2021; Rosa et al., 2022; Sangnak & Tresirichod, 2022 ).Proposition 3 External macro factors affect the investment decisions of farmers involved in agritourism.    Aguilar (1967)  have proposed the PESTEL framework, which includes macro-environmental aspects that cannot be controlled by businesses in each country. These aspects include political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal forces that influence the extent of firms within industries. Mayaka and Prasad (2012)  have provided evidence and used the PESTEL framework to identify the challenges and opportunities in a country’s tourism sector. We use the phrase “external macro factors” to represent the PESTEL framework as a set of instrumental functions that are uncontrollable environmental assessment paradigms affecting organizational decisions (Sangnak et al., 2021; Rosa et al., 2022; Sangnak & Tresirichod, 2022; de Sousa & Castañeda-Ayarza, 2022 ).Proposition 4 External micro factors affect farmers’ investment decisions in agritourism.    Porter (2008)  have proposed the Five Forces Framework, which is based on companies’ needs to cope with external factors when making decisions. Evans et al. (2012)  have explained the Five Forces Framework for analyzing the external environment as an uncontrollable environmental assessment at the microeconomic level based on the marketing variable of an organization’s decision-making on five-force investment pressure. The Five Forces include the following: 1) rivalry among existing competitors, 2) threat of new entrants, 3) bargaining power of suppliers, 4) bargaining power of buyers, and 5) threat of substitute products (Evans et al., 2012; Sangnak et al., 2021; Sangnak & Tresirichod, 2022 ).Proposition 5 External micro factors affect the investment decisions of farmers engaged in agritourism.    When farmers make decisions in the agritourism business, they deal with the consequences of conducting business using the following set of variables: perceived risk, perceived benefit, business adaptation, and homecoming of the offspring. Zawadka et al. (2022)  have proposed tourism in places where the risk of the COVID-19 infection was relatively low because it is suitable for people who wish to travel during such situations. Moreover, it is also a source of recreation because agricultural tourism farms are beautiful places.Proposition 6 The investment decisions of farmers engaged in agritourism business affect perceived risks.    Tew and Barbieri (2012)  have proposed that perceived agritourism benefits influence the incorporation and management of agricultural land for agritourism. Flanigan et al. (2015)  have found that public and private benefits have significant potential to increase agritourism.Proposition 7 The investment decisions of farmers engaged in agritourism business affect perceived benefits.    Camilleri and Valeri (2021)  have proposed that business succession affects ownership structures, and Kallmuenzer et al. (2021)  have found that the descendants of family firms influence positive outcomes or negative growth in family businesses.Proposition 8 The investment decisions of farmers engaged in agritourism affect the homecoming of the offspring.    Doan et al. (2022)  have proposed that agricultural homestay businesses can adapt their internal and external operations because this provides a business opportunity to recover after a crisis.Proposition 9 The investment decisions of farmers engaged in agritourism business affect business adaptation.      2 Methodology We use a multiphase mixed method research by combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to achieve a more in-depth analysis without a prior hypothesis to reduce bias in the research results (Creswell, 2014 ). The research area covers agritourism attractions in Thailand and uses a sample group of tourists to find innovations in agritourism (Sudsawasd et al., 2022 ). As the exact population of agritourism tourists has not been established, we access information using the Google Maps application by searching for the word “agritourism attraction.” Accordingly, we obtain reliable data that can be useful for both operators and agencies (Koo et al., 2021; Speake et al., 2021; Salustri et al., 2022 ). 2.1 Phase 1  quantitative research: Tourist behavior In addition, we used a systematic process to design a questionnaire based on the Delphi principle (Powell, 2003; Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004 ). First, we reviewed the literature related to tourism congruence with the 5As direction. Accordingly, questions were adapted to the context of this research, which contained ten items per factor and a total of 50 questions. Seventeen tourism experts were selected to answer the first set of questionnaires using a five-point Likert scale that contained five responses regarding whether each question met the research objectives. Questions with the most appropriate interpretation were attributed five points and those with the least level of understanding were indicated with one point. The responses were used to find the summation mean. Next, the responses were sorted in a descending order and questions with the highest value were chosen. We selected five questions per factor, totaling 25 questions congruent with the 5As principle. We conducted a the questionnaire survey using a validity test conducted by experts. We used indexes of item-objective congruence for multidimensional items (IOC) to measure internal consistency. The criterion was that all items must have a value of + 1 only (Turner & Carlson, 2003 ). Subsequently, the aforementioned questionnaires were used to the measure the Cronbach's alpha coefficient, indicating the reliability of a set of survey items to study tourist behavior, (Christmann & Van Aelst, 2006; Zhang & Hu, 2011 ) and obtain approval from a certified ethics research committee (Hay, 1998 ). Thai agricultural tourists represent demand-side issues, covering six regions using nonprobability purposive sampling; the respondents were diverse, with 600 samples divided into 100 samples per region (Andrade, 2021 ). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, and there ranking was performed using the one-way ANOVA method to compare the differences between different groups of tourists (Stoline, 1981; Christensen, 2020 ) based on the 5As attraction elements (Dickman, 1996 ).  2.2 Phase 2: Qualitative research: Characteristics of agricultural entrepreneurs Qualitative research was conducted using an in-depth unstructured interview with agritourism entrepreneurs; 30 samples and tourists 30 were divided into 60 samples per region covering six regions of Thailand. The goals was to analyze entrepreneurs’ behavior and the entry mode of agritourism after the COVID-19 pandemic (Boddy, 2016; Deakins & Bensemann, 2018 ). Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data (Braun & Clarke, 2006 ) and understand the characteristics of agricultural entrepreneurs based on value chain-based elements, mode of entry, and decision-making paradigm.  2.3 Phase 3: Quantitative research: Reliability and validity of research results We used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to evaluate the relationship between variables in mathematical measurements. The questionnaires addressed aspects such as demand-side, supply-side, internal-macro, internal-micro, external-macro, and external-micro factors, along with decision-making, and agritourism innovation (Sarstedt et al., 2021 ). All aspects have undergone the same internal consistency, validity, and ethics committee approval. The analysis supported the hypotheses testing (Caplan, 2010 ); the samples used non-probability sampling by purposive sampling, similar to that in Phase 1 (Guarte & Barrios, 2006 ). We determined the sample size, which was generally 600 respondents (Hair et al., 2011 ). PLS-SEM criteria, model fit, and quality index results consisted of average internal consistency reliability, indicator reliability, convergent validity, multicollinearity, and bootstrapping; the author would like to apologize for elaborating on only the important parts. Considering that the PLS-SEM analysis is very detailed, in the remaining aspects will be explained at the next opportunity (Tenenhaus et al., 2005 ).   3 Results and discussion The results of the survey data on Thai tourist behavior indicate that agricultural tourists showed no statistically significant differences (Table 1  ). When considering the comprehensive country characteristics (Table 2  ), PLS-SEM analysis has a model fit. All lines in the table indicate value signification in both inner and outer models compare to the criterion are confirmed by criteria composite reliability (CR) (>0.700) as follow (Table 3  ) values. The model fitness tests and p-values are described in Table 4  . We also report the holistic results of Thai tourist characteristics (Hynes et al., 2011 ). 3.1 Tourist behavior (demand side) Proposition 1 Tourists’ behavior (demand-side) correlates with the characteristics of agritourism entrepreneurs (supply-side), affecting farmers’ decision-making process.    Reflecting tourist behavior, the demand-side has a significant and positive relationship with the supply-side (0.691***), investment decisions of farmers in an agricultural tourism business (0.675***), and agricultural tourism innovation (0.413***), which includes the four observed variables and indicator loading, including: (1) Activity: We find that activity is ranked first in tourist behavior; most tourists trends include agritourism attractions, which are a unique and depict a natural way of life. This has a relaxation effect, and agritourists experience mental peace. This also provides an opportunity to study plants, both domestically and internationally. In some tourist attractions, the conjecture regarding the innovative agricultural activities and intriguing taste of plants, fruits and vegetables, and organic vegetables is consistent with Ohe and Ciani (2011) , who have shown that agritourism is an alternative activity that allows farms to leverage local products for complementary income. Moreover, agritourists get the opportunity to observe to life in old farm houses and agricultural lands, which offers educational and pleasant recreational tourism experiences. (2) Accommodations: Most tourists do not need accommodation and prefer one-day trips, but some tourists are satisfied by multi-day trips, which is why there are accommodations. However, tourists in Thailand still face standard problems. Tourists have the worst experiences with rooms that do not meet their needs, resulting in dissatisfaction. Flanigan et al. (2015)  have found that tourist attractions, facilities, and the countryside greatly influence tourists’ decisions related to agritourism accommodations, day trips, and product demand. (3) Awareness: We found that tourists decide to travel to agritourism places based on their expectations and desire to feel and stay closer to nature and experience and identify with the local culture and community, take care of their health and safety, and create awareness about responsible tourism to maintain the cultural and environmental significance of tourist attractions. Antimova et al. (2012)  have found that individual- and community-level tourist attractions affect tourists’ positive attitudes towards destination awareness. (4) Amenities: Tourists demand comfort during their trips. They want to taste unique food, visit iconic buildings, observe attractive destination decor, and experience other services, all of which focus on the convenience of tourists. This is consistent with Bertacchini et al. (2021) , who have proposed that cultural amenities have the ability to attract tourists. (5) Access: We find that providing tourist satisfaction is an important factor. The fundamental conveniences available at the destination include the comfort of traveling by private cars and public transport, signages that are easy to understand, and the attraction of tourists to well-known and accessible destinations. Moreover, tourist behavior involves tourists searching for travel information from various sources to understand the presentation of tourism activities. Tourists are often known to consult various sources, such as friends, multiple websites, television news, social media platforms, YouTube, bloggers, newspapers, radio, and brochures. This is consistent with Eichhorn et al. (2008) , who have proposed that access to tourism information affects tourists decision-making processes for visiting attractive destinations.  3.2 Characteristics of agritourism entrepreneurs (supply side) As a factor in agritourism business, the supply-side has a significantly positive relationship with the demand-side (0.673***), investment decisions of farmers in an agricultural tourism business (0.703***), and agricultural tourism innovation (0.434***), which include the following nine observed variables and indicator loading: Tourism business strategies to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis included information about tourist behaviors and trends, specifically, the type of agritourism business that affected the community, employees, environment, heritage products, co-created value in the community, enabling distribution throughout the tourism value chain. This is consistent with Magno and Cassia’s (2021)  proposal that agritourism strategies for coping with the COVID-19 crisis positively affected tourists’ experiences with the community, environment, and heritage destinations.(1) Logistics and communications: We find that agritourism entrepreneurs used public relations through social media and government agencies to support, advertise, and attract tourist attention. Organizing activities for tourists, enabling them to understand the destination’s history, creating a beautiful ambience for tourists to appreciate, providing agricultural knowledge, and demonstrating outstanding farming products that are unique to the area, are all consistent with Stock et al. (2000) , who have showed that new digital and Internet-based technologies could enhance logistics communications in tourist attractions.  (2) Customer service: We also find that agritourism entrepreneurs created friendly and positive experiences as they greet tourists with a warm welcome, provide a sense of caring, and arrange activities that tourists can participate in together. They organize and promote tourist attractions and restaurants, highlight raw materials to attract tourists, and ensure their return. This is consistent with Zheng et al. (2022) , who have posited that customer service affects customer loyalty and is important for customer retention.  (3) Order processing: Agritourism entrepreneurs prepared raw materials to meet the needs of tourists by properly managing their farms. However, some raw materials cannot be obtained from farms, and quality materials may have to be procured from a cheaper source. This is consistent with Elshaer et al. (2022) , who have found that reducing order processing time is a product and service choice that prevents unnecessary risk.  (4) Demand forecasting: We find that entrepreneurs expected tourists interested in agricultural tourism to prefer to travel to less crowded and remote places because of the impact of pandemic outbreaks. This is consistent with Hu et al. (2022) , who have found the characteristics of tourism demand forecasting can inform policymaking and increase destination competitiveness in the long term.  (5) Procurement: Entrepreneurs prepared for the procurement of goods and services for agritourism; most raw materials are obtained from farming and rural areas, which is consistent with Galeazzo et al.’s (2021)  analysis that procurement has a positive relationship with tourists' behavior and the financial performance of firms.  (6) Inventory management: Entrepreneurs prepare a list of the top products to attract tourists to adequately meet and suit their demand to review tourist attractions that are posted on various social media platforms. Liu et al. (2022)  show that resulting inventory management relates with a cost-efficient inventory control strategy.  (7) Transportation management: Entrepreneurs prepared transportation infrastructure to enable tourists to travel quickly, conveniently, and easily to their destinations. This made the trip pleasurable and did not hamper travel. Puchongkawarin and Ransikarbum (2021)  have proposed a transportation management approach to improve the quality and promote the development of tourism routes in Thailand.  (8) Warehousing and storage: Entrepreneurs adjusted the process and storage of products and materials over a long time, including some fields that could not be farmed yearly, changing them from rotational agricultural farming. This is consistent with the study results of Guo et al. (2017) , who have shown that warehousing and storage of services and drinking water and food affected value-added output and labor income from tourism.  (9) Reverse logistics: Long-term planning was conducted to maintain equipment and other items associated with agritourism attractions, including preparing a tourist satisfaction survey questionnaire and using the results to improve and develop a more efficient system to address tourist dissatisfaction by fixing and enhancing service quality. This is consistent with Mo et al. (2020)  proposal that managers should customize spare parts and support services with a holistic outlook toward customer satisfaction.  (10) Plant and warehouse site selection: Agritourism management involves natural agricultural sources in the surrounding area and is linked to other tourist attractions involving the use of other farmlands and open spaces for tourists to travel and plan longer trips to. This is consistent with Shukla et al. (2017) , who have proposed that the decision regarding proper location is critical to solving problems like accessibility distance from the farming zone.  (11) Material handling: A system for the trans -shipment of agritourism products must consider the costs of raw materials that cannot be obtained from agricultural products. Agriculture and packaging items, such as raw materials required for packaging, decorations imported from abroad, and products from the city, are all sold in the mountains. If tourists are interested in taking them home, they should be able buy the products at tourist attractions only, which is the highlight of agritourism. This is consistent with Sančanin (2019) , who have suggested that agritourism is involved in the transmission of material and non-material cultural heritage, specific values, and community significance.  (12) Packaging: The preparation and pre-arrangement of agritourism attractions allows tourists visiting the natural atmosphere to enjoy the uniqueness and beauty of the tourist attractions. When tourists visit and see the beauty and ambience of a place, they feel relaxed and happy. Some places sell the harvested produce for income. Such places are also agricultural tourist attractions. The entrepreneurs can teach the tourists how to farm, demonstrate how produce is harvested, and how items are items are derived from agricultural produce. Additionally, a product may be processed to add value to agriculture and create a unique product. Zhou et al. (2014)  have found that packaging with cultural connotations and artistic taste is fundamental to reflecting the beauty of the designed packaging and that eco-packaging concept increases sales.     3.3 Internal Macro factors Proposition 2 Internal  macro factors affect the investment decisions of farmers pursuing agritourism.    Internal macro factors have a positive effect on farmers’ investment in agricultural tourism businesses (0.633***) and agricultural tourism innovations (0.323***), that have the four-observed variables and accept indicator loading including;(1) Ownership advantage: Thailand has rich agricultural resources, such as land, water, and weather conditions that are suitable for developing an agritourism model. Farmers use different crop and livestock farming patterns. This is an advantage in the ownership and sustainability of the farming experience, consistent with Stensland and Baardsen’s (2012)  finding that ownership is positively correlated with the long-term profitability of agritourism business.  (2) Location: Thailand is suitable for agriculture because its characteristics are suitable for agricultural operations, and agricultural innovation has played a major role in the country’s economic transformation. Therefore, farmers must develop technology and adapt holistic learning skills to increase production efficiency and generate income. Vanslembrouck et al. (2005)  have found that location increases the awareness of farmers' role in rural landscape maintenance and may also affect the assessment of tourism establishments.  (3) Internalization: Government agencies must educate entrepreneurs to help them gain entrepreneurial skills to conduct their businesses efficiently. The initial process of agritourism management may involve learning how to attract tourists by selling products, extending the product to a sales area at the location, and further developing agritourism management by boosting tourism activities in the area, including connecting the area with other diverse tourist attractions. Filipova (2015)  have found that the pattern and incorporation of a company are related to the decision to start an agritourism business.  (4) Financial management (F) provides the flexibility to repay financial institutions and pay taxes to the government. However, farmers must use their savings or borrow money to design landscapes that attract tourists. By maintaining a record of the income and expenses suitable for the agricultural tourism business, the daily cash balance can be calculated to ensure that real income is generated daily to analyze the financial situation of the business.    Cash management is essential for practicing budgetary control, regularly checking the financial situation, and tax management for paying taxes as a legal duty. However, farmers keen to pursue agritourism often do not want to pay taxes or welfare expenses. The vast majority of farmers in Thailand are ignorant of such matters, resulting in accumulated losses over a long period. This makes them unsuccessful in the decision-making to take up agritourism business. Usman et al. (2020)  have found that financial status affects decision-making in the tourism business.  3.4 Internal macro factor Proposition 3 Internal micro factors affect the investment decisions of farmers involved in agritourism business.    Internal micro-factors have a positive relationship with the investment decisions of farmers engaged in agricultural tourism business (0.210***) and agricultural tourism innovation (0.253***), that have the four observed variables and accept indicator loadings, including.(1) The values reveal the unique characteristics of agricultural areas, agricultural plantations, agroforestry, herbal gardens, cattle, livestock farms, lifestyles, cultures, traditions, and knowledge, which are all special and can be used to establish agricultural tourism destinations. Fang et al. (2022)  have found that agritourism focuses on learning about rural people’s agricultural activities by emphasizing the participation of tourists in activities that foster learning.  (2) Rarity reveals tourism patterns based on current tourist trends and helps arrange activities to attract tourists. Product quality management is used to develop product diversity. Art and architecture are used in agritourism activities for businesses to organize practical and theoretical learning, which include historical tourism resources, cultural and social traditional festivals for entertainment, and recreational activities involving man-made resources such as museums, festivals, and traditions. This is consistent with Hughes (2022) , who have found that tourist attractions renowned for art and culinary delicacies increase consumers' value.  (3) Imitation reveals that it is difficult for non-local people to imitate agricultural management. It involves learning from the older generations until it becomes a body of knowledge for the community that has been studying it over a long time period. Such knowledge cannot be imitated. This is consistent with Elche et al. (2021) , who have proposed that tourist attractions cannot imitate and pioneer the orientation of firms engaged in the tourism and hospitality sector in cultural destinations.  (4) Organization reveals the traditional family model of agriculture used in each process by family members and relatives. Accordingly, it may not be possible to distinguish the relationship between agricultural and family workers. Moreover, most farmers were high school graduates, although a few had bachelor's degrees. Thus, modern and system management are rarely used in the administration of agritourism businesses. If farmers lack adequate knowledge of tourism management and business administration, they may not succeed. This is consistent with Rahman et al. (2021) , who have found that tourist attractions comprise diverse social groups. The family or household is associated with cultural capital and a cooperative management structure is best applied to micro-level or local communities.     3.5 External macro factor Proposition 4 External macro factors affect farmers’ investment decisions to be involved in agritourism business.    External macro factors have a positive relationship with the investment decisions of farmers engaged in an agricultural tourism business (0.222***) and agricultural tourism innovation (0.554***), which have the five observed variables and accept indicator loading:(1) Political variables for agritourism are government policies that support agritourism and government agencies at the national and local levels. The Thai government’s policy supports comprehensive tourism management and defines the country’s economic fundamentals to evenly distribute income, increase the potential of entrepreneurs, develop a new generation of entrepreneurs, and adjust business models to respond to market demand. To this end, the government has launched a project to genuinely distribute income among community members.    However, despite the government's efforts to encourage farmers to organize agritourism businesses, factors such as political uncertainty, transfer of government officials, government policy changes, and insufficient budget support seem to be major barriers to implementation. Therefore, most of the country's farmers have no confidence when making decisions regarding agritourism. Shahrabani et al. (2019)  have found that political situations and state policies affect tourists' intentions to travel to destinations and the establishment of agritourism businesses. According to Liu et al. (2020) , the central and local governments coordinate with businesses and residents to support rural tourism development.(2) Economic: In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, several service businesses that were once prosperous were liquidated because of travel control measures; however, this provided an opportunity for agritourism and farmers began searching for outstanding local resources to promote agritourism and generate income to be distributed among the local population. Hatan et al. (2021)  have proposed that agricultural landscapes provide a wide range of economic systems for the service industry, and aesthetic landscape services have no direct market value; therefore, land-use decision-makers must engage in the agritourism business.  (3) Social conditions: Currently, although Thailand is experiencing a boom across various industries, heavy industry is labor-intensive, and working in an office causes stress. Moreover, commuting to the office has several problems, such as traffic congestion, and office-goers face water, land, and air pollution issues. Moreover, quality of life in urban Thailand is poor.    In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Thai people living in urban areas have become more interested in agritourism. The pandemic affected people by changing their values, such as interest in local identity and culture. Urban residents are now yearning for nature and fresh air that cannot be found in large cities. Social systems are conducive to agritourism because agriculture has long been the mainstay of the Thai economy. Thai tourists now prefer to travel to less crowded places because of COVID-19 precautions. Mishra and Mishra (2021)  have found that social systems recognize self-sufficiency by emphasizing local resources to promote the service, tourism, and agriculture sectors.(4) Technological: Technology is mainly used in tourism development for public relations and publishing of different images and information for attracting tourists to experience the agricultural technology that is essential for the agritourism business and gain new knowledge about the agritourism destination. Another important aspect of technological development is the use of social media platforms and websites to advertise goods and services. Gössling (2020)  have proposed that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of information and communication technology (ICT) as an innovative approach for the sustainable development of tourism.  (5) Environmental conditions: Agritourism supports the way of life of the community members who still maintain and lead the traditional way of life, including the systems linking tourism and transportation, which includes basic infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, and water supply, and tourist facilities such as hotels and restaurants. Zhao et al. (2022)  have proposed that the relationship between environmental values and attitudes and behavioral intentions improves local infrastructure and increases income in rural areas.  (6) Legal ecosystem: In the agritourism business, entrepreneurs must have the knowledge and understanding of regulations and laws to raise the standards of agritourism, which leads to confidence in tourists and the hospitality industry, such as accommodation standards, tourism management, and landscape standards. Gozgor et al. (2019)  have found that judicial independence and better legal enforcement enhance inbound tourism development.     3.6 External micro factor Proposition 5 External micro factors affect the investment decisions of farmers engaged in agritourism.    External macro factors have a positive relationship with the investment decisions of farmers engaged in agricultural tourism business (0.490***) and agricultural tourism innovation (0.483***) that have the five observed variables accept and indicator loading, including:(1) Rivalry between firms and competition: The agritourism business has become more competitive, with agritourism being a more socialist trend for meeting the needs of tourists of all ages and groups. The popularity of agritourism has broadened and improved as compared to that in the past. For the agritourism business to be successful and sustainable, community acceptance and participation by local groups or parties are required to increase competitiveness, which enables employment and income distribution in the local community.    The agritourism management discussed in most research is more capitalistic in nature than farmers or communities, which makes the income generated from tourism reach only a small number of farmers. The development of agritourism requires considerations regarding the agritourism supply chain for quality control and standards in sustainable tourism management. Sigala (2019)  have found that a competitive micro-environments influence tourism demand and represents factors beyond the control of individual tourism firms.(2) Threat of new entrants: The agritourism business is trendy and the entry of new competitors is high. Therefore, farmers must highlight their farms to differentiate themselves in attracting tourists or providing tourists with unique or excellent travel experiences. This can be an alternative for tourists to compare prices based on convenient services and quality, and the pricing must consider service quality and competition. Verhees et al. (2018)  have found that farmers are new entrants to agritourism because most of them do not have formal training in agriculture. For non-economic reasons, the conservation of agritourism helps maintain rural landscapes and preserve heritage and natural resources.  (3) Bargaining power of suppliers: The management model of farmers, based on traditional way of life of each locality, represents a farmer's management style; therefore, it does not have to rely on purchasing from raw material suppliers, except for plants or animals that are not native to the area, to have a differentiated appeal. For example, colored rice and colorful flowers. Using beauty and knowledge of architecture to design an ordinary flower garden on a beautiful plot is a capital intensive activity and because it needs to be constantly maintained to attract tourists. Buhalis and Law (2008)  have found that the bargaining power of suppliers is low in the tourism business because it allows direct contact with consumers and decreases distribution costs while creating the opportunity for partnerships with multiple affiliates and other distributors from the area.  (4) Buyers’ bargaining power: Tourists seek alternatives to tourism as agritourism grow competitive. Considering that tourists have enormous power and freedom to select a travel destination, their buyer power determines tourism behavior. The physical characteristics of tourists are based on their satisfaction and budget. Zhang et al. (2018)  have found that topographic and sociodemographic characteristics indicate tourists’ relative bargaining power and that tourists tend to have more substantial bargaining power.  (5) Substitute products: The threat of substitute products in the agritourism business remains low because agritourism is distinctly different from other types of tourism. This is because agritourism emphasizes the participation of tourists in activities that promote learning about agriculture and ways of life. Moreover, it helps generate income for the community and farmers. Yang et al. (2009)  have found that the success of tourism operators often depends on cooperation because they tend to collaborate with the community to provide complementary or substitute products for accommodating tourists.    Farmers’ decision to invest in an agritourism business  When a farmer decides to become an agritourism entrepreneur, it connotes that the farmer has always seen potential in the territory’s cultural, culinary, artistic, and environmental heritage and that it must be systematized and enhanced into an agritourism attraction. However, farmers do not understand the importance of tourist attractions and it is difficult for start-up agritourism businesses to be launched.  3.7 Perceived risks Proposition 6 Investment decisions of farmers engaged in an agritourism businesses affect perceived risks.    (1) Perceived risk results can be explained by the indicator loadings of 0.861 (significant) and farmers’ decisions to invest in agritourism businesses risk because of a lack of experience in risk and business management skills. Some farmers are brave enough to make investment decisions without risk assessment and backup planning, which leads to the miscalculations and errors in doing business. This is consistent with farmers’ decisions to pursue agritourism considering the perceived risks of farm succession, inheritance, and retirement. Conversely, the current policy reduces this perceived risk. The influence of financial factors should be considered during this integration.  3.8 Perceived benefits Proposition 7 Investment decisions of farmers engaged in agritourism businesses affect perceived benefits    Perceived benefit results can be explained by the indicator loading of 0.907 (significant), which indicates that farmers are not interested in the agritourism business because it affects their way of life and livelihood. Farmers receive sufficient income from agriculture without the need to offer tourist services in agritourism management. This is because most agritourism management requires offspring to help manage. Tew and Barbieri (2012)  have proposed perceived agritourism benefits for customers, including educating the public and enhancing farmers’ quality of life, representing both economic and non-economic goals and the entrepreneurial development of agritourism sustainability.  3.9 Homecoming of offspring Proposition 8 Investment decisions of farmers engaged in agritourism business affect the homecoming of offspring    Homecoming results can be explained by the indicator loading of 0.882 (significant), which is a result of farmers who decide to invest in agritourism business as an investment opportunity. This is rooted in the fact that most farmers in Thailand have less education than a bachelor's degree and no business administration knowledge, tourism management skills, marketing expertise, technology services, or other criteria necessary for agritourism. The direct effect helps increase income for farmers, whereas the indirect effect is a reduction in the population density in urban areas. Camilleri and Valeri (2021)  have suggested that offspring, as a business succession issue, may affect the ownership structures of family enterprises involved in tourism, governance, leadership, management, and strategies. Elmo et al. (2020)  have suggested that the innovation process occurs after the succession. Therefore, a family firm’s offspring may present new opportunities, resources, knowledge, and information.  3.10 Business adaptation Proposition 9 Investment decisions of farmers engaged in agritourism businesses affect business adaptation    Adaptation results can be explained by the indicator loading of 0.756 (significant), which is the perception and practice of farmers who can adapt to changes in a situation (such as the situation during the COVID-19 pandemic), allowing them to manage tourism sustainably. Doan et al. (2022)  have proposed that homestay businesses show a strong capacity for adaptation to internal and external shocks and suggested practical implications for homestay owners and stakeholders regarding post-pandemic recovery in their business.  3.6 The options: Agritourism innovation In agritourism, innovations are defined as “everything on the farm differs from other businesses, which represent innovative firms to serve tourists” and occur in product and service-related processes, management, marketing, or institutional innovations. We find the following agritourism innovations: Agricultural learning centers with integrated tourism innovations that combine knowledge from traditional sources, such as animal farming tourism, marine fishing farms, flower garden tourism, garden innovation and architecture, agricultural technology, tourism in rice fields, picturesque salt fields, coconut plantations, strawberry farms, highland tourism, innovations in agritourism and accommodation, tourism that combines spirituality, and city simulators as tourist attractions (Damnet et al., 2021 ), as shown in Fig. 1  .   4 Conclusion: Holistic result The new paradigm is a qualitative, instrumental, and statistically tested tool that provides farmers with entrepreneurial skills and comprehensive, interdisciplinary knowledge. It is embedded within the farmers themselves in the form of investment and holistically and systematically uses various farm resources from the area. Tourist behavior (demand side)   The results research suggest that, when testing the differences between agricultural tourists and tourist behavior on the demand-side, no statistically significant differences exist; therefore, it is assumed same characteristics exist throughout the country. When examined in detail, the tourists were found to be satisfied. In the Thai context, agricultural tourism aspects have the following order: (1) activities, (2) accommodation, (3) awareness, (4) amenities, and (5) access.  Characteristics of agritourism entrepreneurs (supply side) According to the value chain approach, the characteristics of entrepreneurs are as follows: (1) logistics and communications, (2) customer service, (3) order processing, (4) demand forecasting, (5) procurement, (6) inventory management, (7) transportation management, (8) warehousing and storage, (9) reverse logistics, (11) plant and warehouse site selection, and (12) material handling. Tourist behavior correlates with agritourism entrepreneurs’ supply-side characteristics Therefore, tourists behavior affects entrepreneurial characteristics, and entrepreneurs affect tourists’ behavior. This depended on the social trends at that time.  Internal macro factors Internal macro factors, including ownership, location, internationalization, and financial management, are used as strategic measures in internal organizations at the macroeconomic level.  Internal micro factors Internal micro-factors are utilized as strategic measures in internal organizations at the microeconomic level. These measures include value, rarity, imitation, and organization.  External macro factors External macro factors are utilized as strategic measures in external organizations at the macroeconomic level. These factors are as follows: (1) political, (2) economic, (3) social conditions, (4) technological, (5) environmental conditions, (6) legal system.  External micro factors External macro factors are used as strategic measures in external organizations at the macroeconomic level. They include the following: (1) rivalry among firms and competition, (2) the threat of new entrants, (3) the bargaining power of suppliers, (4) the bargaining power of buyers, and (5) substitute products.  Decision-Making Farmers must use tourist behavior (demand-side), characteristics of agritourism entrepreneurs (supply-side), internal macro factors, internal micro factors, external macro factors, and external micro factors to analyze the data before deciding to invest in the agritourism business. When farmers engage in the agritourism business in the aftermath of decision-making, it affects the agritourism business in the following ways: (1) perceived risks, (2) perceived benefits, (3) homecoming of offspring, and (4) Business Adaptation.  The options: Agritourism innovation In the last phase, farmers must undertake agritourism innovation based on the community context and location of farm by innovation. By conducting a survey in Thailand, we found the following innovative tourism innovations: animal farming tourism, marine fishing farms, flower garden tourism, garden innovation and architecture, agricultural technology, and tourism in rice fields, picturesque salt fields, coconut plantations and strawberry farms, highland tourism, innovations in agritourism and accommodation, tourism that combines spirituality, and city simulators. Each tourist attraction has its own unique characteristics and different ways to attract tourists through agritourism innovation.  Academic contribution This research project takes a comprehensive look at agritourism within the context of Thailand, serving as a sample group. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact, making agriculture a pivotal component of the economic system in nearly every country worldwide. Tourism is seen as an extension that contributes to economic progress, culminating in the concept of agricultural tourism. Consequently, researchers and academics can use this paradigm to develop sub-modules for in-depth analysis, especially focusing on data not covered in this article for future research. Policy Recommendations  Agritourism offers a significant opportunity to help farmers enhance their household income by creating stable jobs and ensuring sustainability, particularly when agricultural products are affected by seasonal variations. Organizing agritourism allows farmers to gain direct experiences from tourists. Consequently, farmers can learn how creativity influences management by default. Successful agricultural tourism necessitates collaboration between government and private agencies. This approach will provide a strong foundation for diverse tourist attractions. Furthermore, adapting to current trends will ensure the sustainability of agritourism in the future. For instance, incorporating technological innovations into agricultural tourism has become imperative. The author may seek to define agricultural tourism in the context of the “Disruption era,” which is expected to align with global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Bio-Circular Green Economy (BCG).
