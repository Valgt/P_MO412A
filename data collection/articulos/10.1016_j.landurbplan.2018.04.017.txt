                  The aim of this perspective essay is to discuss how integrated landscape management (ILM) can contribute to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda in Europe. Challenges for sustainable development become evident in the emergence of land-use conflicts. Facing multiple, and in sometimes conflicting, land-use objectives and policies, we elaborate on the potential of ILM to support multifunctionality and integration across sectors and scales. Based on three recent land-use conflict cases from distinct European contexts, we empirically identify and discuss key characteristics of ILM for land-use conflict resolution as a means for SDG implementation. These conflicts are (1) agricultural production versus nature conservation, (2) urban sprawl and rural land abandonment versus landscape integrity, and (3) renewable energy generation versus landscape aesthetics. In our cases we find common concerns of decreasing landscape quality as a basis for actors to engage in collective action, the need for multi-actor/multi-sector collaboration, and the assignment of clear rights and responsibilities for land management. In contrast, issues of capacity building, transparency in decision-making and flexibility for adaptations are found lacking. Finally, we discuss ways how ILM can improve policy and practice to handle ambiguous interests and goals, and highlight the future role of landscape research in supporting SDG implementation at the landscape level in Europe.

Continuously pressing environmental problems such as natural resource exploitation and land degradation underscore the need for a systemic understanding of environmental and social problems, and the creation of adaptive management and policy solutions (West et al., 2014 ). The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were recently superseded by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which, different to their precursors, apply to all countries regardless of their level of development. At their core, the 17 SDGs and their 169 associated targets propose a global transformative agenda towards sustainable development and a transition to sustainable lifestyles (Hajer et al., 2015; Keesstra, Quinton, van der Putten, Bardgett, & Fresco, 2016 ). They highlight the close interconnection between healthy ecosystem management and sustainable economic growth (Milder, Hart, Dobie, Minai, & Zaleski, 2014 ), and foster the integration of environmental and societal agendas at all scales for improved coordination of policy and civil society initiatives (Mbow, Neely, & Dobie, 2015 ). The implementation of the SDG agenda (from here on referred to as SDG implementation) builds on three basic principles: Indivisibility – all goals need to be implemented; inclusion – all people shall benefit; and acceleration – the need for actions that have multiple development dividends. While these principles serve as a universal orientation, it is at the level of landscapes where farmers, foresters, agencies, non-governmental organisation (NGOs), businesses and civil society encounter concrete development demands, and where land management systems have to balance the trade-offs between them (cf. Thaxton et al., 2015 ). Local actions of land managers can either directly or indirectly align with most land-related SDGs (cf. Bouma, 2014 ), for example by contributing to food security and an end to hunger (SDG 2), to healthy lives and well-being (SDG 3), to sustainable water management (SDG 6), to modern energy supply (SDG 7), to combat climate change (SDG 13), and to the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15) (cf. Reed, Van Vianen, Deakin, Barlow, & Sunderland, 2016 ). As land resources are limited and many European landscapes have to accommodate multiple land uses, we propose the promotion of multifunctional, integrated, and collaborative management solutions as an essential component for SDG implementation in Europe. Although the debate on SDG implementation has not fully emerged yet in the European context, there are reasons to assume that it will prove challenging. While a lack of appropriate institutions often hinder SDG implementation in developing countries, barriers for Europe are more anchored in sectoral approaches, path dependent agency responsibilities, and institutionalised land-use conflicts (cf. Hersperger, Ioja, Steiner, & Tudor, 2015 ). Even though there is growing acknowledgement that sectoral approaches to addressing interconnected social-ecological problems are insufficient (Freeman, Duguma, & Minang, 2015 ), the institutional context in Europe is largely characterised by a lack of synchronised policy objectives and interagency collaboration (Young et al., 2005 ). It has been anticipated that many regions will be unable to achieve sustainable development objectives without modifying current policy frameworks and land-use practices (Mbow et al., 2015; Seto & Reenberg, 2014 ). Other authors even raise fundamental doubts about the overall compatibility of economic and environmental developments (e.g. Redclift, 2005 ). In addition, neither a theoretical framework for SDG implementation nor guidance for SDG prioritisation exists for different context, which makes trade-off analysis problematic. Expected challenges for SDG implementation in Europe become already visible in the emergence and intensification of land-use conflicts that are largely caused by distributed responsibilities among sectors and scales, diverging land development objectives, and the lack of enforcement of existing sustainable development strategies (e.g. Keesstra et al., 2016; Reed et al., 2016 ). Taking these challenges as a starting point for our essay, we argue that implementing agencies may consider integrated approaches to land management that have the potential to bridge different SDGs. We draw on recent contributions from landscape research where concepts of integrated landscape management (ILM) are currently on the rise (e.g. Opdam, Luque, Nassauer, Verburg, & Wu, 2018; Plieninger et al., 2015; Shuttleworth & Palang, 2017 ). The aim of this perspective essay is to explore the potential of ILM in three different European contexts as case study examples to highlight how ILM can resolve conflict and contribute to SDG implementation in Europe. ILM refers to a range of management concepts that promote stakeholder collaboration to address linked social-ecological challenges. It can support the implementation of the SDG agenda in Europe as landscapes represent a suitable operational scale for sustainability goals, linking local actions to the global context (Estrada-Carmona, Hart, DeClerck, Harvey, & Milder, 2014; Wu, 2013 ). The sustained delivery of multiple benefits for natural and human wellbeing can be elaborated in concrete contexts, landscape challenges assessed, and ways for conflict resolution among development objectives debated in a participatory way (Mbow et al., 2015; Milder et al., 2014 ). In this regard, we focus on terrestrial land-uses and ecosystem service provision, and analyse which ILM approaches can support land-use conflict resolution. Each of the examples highlights a particular challenge for land management in Europe, i.e., targeting a typical land-use conflict, and highlighting ways how integrated management can – or seeks to - foster multi-actor and multi-sector collaboration for enabling a transition towards achieving the SDGs. More particularly, we address the following two objectives:1) To identify main characteristics of ILM based on insights from landscape research;  2) To analyse the role these characteristics have played in land-use conflict resolution in three different European contexts. The analysis then serves as a basis to derive recommendations on how ILM can contribute to SDG implementation in Europe.    This paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 , we introduce the main characteristics of ILM. From these we derive a list of eight analytical questions and select three ‘typical’ cases of land-use conflicts in Europe to explore how ILM is used for conflict resolution and the extent ILM characteristic have played out (Section 3 ). In Section 4 , we discuss the potential and limitations of ILM approaches for SDG implementation across cases, and in Section 5  we draw conclusions for European landscape policy and practice.  2 Approach 2.1 Main characteristics of integrated landscape management ILM has become a new strategy for landscape governance to address growing land-use conflicts in response to multifunctional management of landscapes worldwide (Freeman et al., 2015 ). Compared to conventional landscape planning approaches, ILM is more holistic, flexible, and coherent with a range of land uses and sectors (Reed et al., 2016 ). Its aim is to involve a range of stakeholders and to combine policies, information, planning, control, and negotiation for multiple land-use objectives, such as agricultural production, rural livelihoods, and nature conservation. ILM explicitly considers land rights, restrictions, and responsibilities (Estrada-Carmona et al., 2014 ). Generally, ILM builds on four central characteristics: (a) It promotes multifunctional land uses and fulfills a range of land use objectives (cf. Mastrangelo et al., 2014 ); (b) it works at the landscape scale and includes deliberative planning and co-design of management approaches (Milder et al., 2014 ); (c) it incorporates inter-sectoral cooperation and the alignment of activities, policies, or investments, acknowledging conflicts and interference with other policy sectors and actors (Stenseke, 2016 ); and (d) it is participatory, in that it supports collaborative management within a social learning framework (García-Martín, Bieling, Hart, & Plieninger, 2016 ). The underlying rationale for ILM is to achieve conflict resolution with the help of participation, collaboration, and learning. The appeal of ILM has resulted in the production of manifold concepts over the past 20 years that mainly differ in their management focus (e.g. Milder et al., 2014; Sayer et al., 2013; Scherr, Shames, & Friedman, 2012 ). Examples include Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), the Ecosystem Approach, Integrated Rural Development (IRD), and Integrated Natural Resource Management (INRM) (Reed et al., 2016 ). Related discourses in Europe have used terms such as Collaborative Landscape Planning, Landscape Approach, Landscape Governance, or Landscape Stewardship (e.g. Angelstam et al., 2013 ). Out of these more regional and sectorial approaches, ILM has developed as an umbrella discourse that is applicable globally and in science, practice, as well as policy (cf. García-Martín et al., 2016 ; Zanzanaini et al., 2017 ). Landscape research has suggested central concepts for landscape approaches and principles of ILM for their better operationalisation and use. Sayer et al. (2013)  were among the first who set up a comprehensive list of ten ILM principles. Based on a systematic review of hundreds of ILM cases, Freeman et al. (2015)  recently identified six cross-cutting concepts that all guide the design and conduct of decision-making processes in landscape contexts as ‘good practices’. These, according to Mbow et al. (2015) , can be further distinguished between principles that are related to overall stakeholder needs and aims, while others function as prerequisites or action items. Building on these conceptual considerations, we investigate whether ILM may overcome challenges related to SDG implementation in Europe due to its capacity to collaboratively achieve land-use conflict resolution. To analyse the links between the challenges of SDG implementation, land-use conflicts, and ILM, we derived a list of eight questions based on the main characteristics of ILM approaches, to be empirically tested in distinct European contexts (Table 1  ). These characteristics are seen as an ideal-typical model of ILM which needs to be further adapted to implementation contexts.  2.2 Case study selection and analysis Selection criteria for cases include, first, the representation of major European land-use trends that cause land-use conflicts. Chosen trends are increasing urbanisation pressures, renewable energy demands, and agricultural intensification. All of these trends and related land-use conflicts are closely linked to differing and in part diverging SDGs. Second, cases were selected where the implemented land management solution shows characteristics of an ILM approach. An extensive scanning of land management approaches has been carried out by the FP7 European landscape research project HERCULES (www.hercules-landscapes.eu ). As a result of the scan, three cases were deemed suitable as they, in addition to the two selection criteria, are spread across a gradient of land use (intensively managed to abandoned/protected) and biogeographic conditions (northern/temperate to southern/Mediterranean). The three cases are:• Conflict between agricultural production (SDG2) and sustainable ecosystems/nature conservation (SDG15): Dartmoor National Park, United Kingdom.  • Conflict caused by increasing urbanisation pressure, aesthetics/recreation needs, and land abandonment (SDG3, 11) and landscape integrity (SDG15): Colmenar Viejo, Spain.  • Conflict between wind energy uses (SDG7) and cultural landscapes/aesthetics/recreation needs (SDG3): Soonwald Nature Park, Germany.    All cases were empirically surveyed through intensive interaction with stakeholders in the form of workshops, expert interviews, and structured surveys with local residents. This provided a deep understanding of the social-ecological context, for example on how values and changes in the landscape are perceived and how conflict management solutions are developing. Next, the three land-use conflicts cases are described, followed by an elaboration of the characteristics of the ILM approach that have played a decisive role (or lack thereof) for conflict resolution for achieving multiple land-use objectives in the realm of SD.   3 Results 3.1 Three cases of land-use conflicts and ILM solutions 3.1.1 Dartmoor National Park, United Kingdom The Dartmoor Farming Futures Initiative in Dartmoor National Park, South West Devon, illustrates how land-use conflicts between agricultural production and nature conservation can be eased with the help of an integrated landscape management plan. The analysis is based on semi-structured interviews conducted at land managers’ residences in the area (Raymond, Reed, Bieling, Robinson, & Plieninger, 2016 ). The main challenge for conflict resolution is to align the landscape management priorities of Natural England and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA (the public bodies responsible for England’s natural environment), and those of the commons owners and hill farmers. Often there are conflicting views on land management between these groups; for example, regarding the optimum livestock stocking rates on moorlands. As a result of lowering stocking rates on Dartmoor, hill farmers have had to increase the area of land they lease or manage (to maintain the same head of stock). This demands the purchase of more leases, which adds to debt in an industry that traditionally does not have a high profit margin. Many hill farmers, therefore, rely on higher levels of agri-environment subsidies for survival. Adding value to livestock produce (e.g., encouraging organic cooperatives) may be one way of countering such trends, and increasing demand for land. Also, trees had colonised the open moor landscape and gorse had begun to obscure substantial above-ground archaeological remains, thus endangering heritage values. To address these challenges, land management plans are being developed. As part of a specific plan for the commons, farmers can identify a range of outcomes that could be delivered from the land – these cover the full spectrum of ecosystem services from food production to water management where applicable. The farmers then use their expertise and experience to identify the management required to deliver these outcomes, which after much negotiation, are included in an integrated management plan signed by both Commons Association and various State agencies. The activities included in the farm-scale plan may be very different to the generic, top-down activities imposed by Natural England and DEFRA through more traditional agri-environmental schemes, as they are tailored to the needs of the individual farmer, the specific assets present on his/her hill farm and the collective interests of the Commons Association in which that farm is located. Currently, around 15–20% of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments to farmers are for agri-environment schemes. It is this component of the CAP which has been renegotiated through the Dartmoor Future Farming Initiative; not affecting the Basic Payment Scheme which is paid in accordance with the area in which land managers farm.  3.1.2 Colmenar Viejo, Spain Colmenar Viejo, a municipality in central Spain close to Madrid, is characterised by increasing urbanisation pressure parallel to processes of land abandonment, which is in conflict with landscape integrity, local peoples’ landscape identity, recreation needs, and well-being. Insights to this case were gained through a series of workshops, oral history interviews, and participatory GIS approaches (Garcia-Martin et al., 2017; Kizos et al., 2018 ). The landscape of Colmenar Viejo has historically been shaped by extensive farming. The main activity today is services, and the area’s main asset is its proximity to Madrid and the capital’s labour markets. In recent decades, the population has increased fivefold. Parallel to the growth in the urban area, the surrounding rural landscape has become increasingly abandoned. This abandonment is apparent in many ways: a decrease in farming activity, an increase in woodlands and scrublands, and the abandonment of drystone walls. Increasingly, the landscape surrounding the city is considered to be a recreational asset rather than a productive and multifunctional landscape. The municipality’s current policy involves encouraging further population growth, the aim of which is to give its inhabitants access to the facilities that are the privilege of big cities (such as communication infrastructure and health facilities). At the same time, the local administration does not have a clear vision for the future development of its rural landscapes. Local initiatives in the area aim to integrate multiple uses and maintain high quality rural landscapes, especially by reconnecting urban people with the countryside through improved outdoor recreation possibilities and awareness/knowledge about local ecosystems and cultural heritage. To this end, the land management strategy followed by the Environment Department of the municipality includes the maintenance, designation, and promotion of the walking trails that cross the rural landscape starting from the city centre; providing recommendations on how to collect wild vegetables without putting ecosystems at risk; restoring native vegetation, maintaining traditional drystone walls, and developing an interactive website where people can experience the landscapes of Colmenar Viejo through the sounds and images captured by people from the town. In addition, cultural heritage restoration efforts have been implemented to raise people’s awareness of the municipality’s past and its landscape values.  3.1.3 Soonwald Nature Park, Germany The Soonwald Nature Park in Southwestern Germany illustrates a growing land-use conflict between infrastructural developments for wind energy and landscape aesthetics/recreation demands. Insights have been generated from interviews with key actors in the region conducted by Arifi, Winkel, and Ruppert-Winkel (2017) , as well as from secondary sources (Boos & Steffen, 2016 ). The Soonwald Nature Park includes large, contiguous forest areas, which are valued for their aesthetics, biodiversity, and recreational opportunities. Due to its topography, the area has some of the highest potential for wind energy development in inland Germany. Many villages have sought additional income by renting sites to energy companies for wind energy development. A conflict has emerged as windfarms are perceived to threaten the aesthetics of the landscape. Forest must be cleared to allow construction access, and when completed, the turbines rise high above the forest line. The legal and planning process for wind energy is complicated as, while each local village can enter into agreements with energy companies to lease their land, permission for such developments is granted by the municipal associations of which each village is a member. Landscape-level “solidarity pacts” have been developed as a solution to facilitate the negotiation of agreements between member villages and their municipal associations. These agreements restrict wind energy development to a selection of sites and ensure the distribution of wind energy income, also to member villages that are denied development permission. Payments into a joint fund range from 10% to 50% of the income derived from wind energy. These funds are then redistributed amongst disadvantaged villages and used to develop alternative income streams such as tourism. Solidarity pacts reduce the impact of wind turbines on the landscape scenery, while generating income for all villages in the area. Furthermore, the villages without the potential for wind energy development then gain an advantage as they become comparatively more attractive for nature tourism.   3.2 Characteristics of ILM approaches for conflict resolution The three cases show commonalities and differences regarding the characteristics of the implemented ILM approaches that have an influence on the success or failure for conflict resolution. Commonly, and most obviously, characteristics that relate to a multiplicity of land-use objectives and land users are decisive in all three case studies, even though there are differences in terms of scope and intensity. In contrast ILM characteristics that relate to process quality such as transparency, adaptation, and capacity-building, are differently integrated or even absent in the cases. This influences their conflict resolution potential, as detailed below following our eight analytical questions. 3.2.1 Does the approach build on a common landscape concern/problem understanding? A perceived decrease in landscape quality is a common stakeholder concern in all three cases. For example, changing from open moorland to closed woodlands and forests in Dartmoor is disliked by farmers seeking to preserve primary production values. Similarly, in Colmenar Viejo, increasing urbanisation and land abandonment prompted local residents to demand that the typical rural landscape and features of the area, such as drystone walls, be maintained. Demands to preserve the landscape also form the starting point in the Soonwald Nature Park, where local people feel their quality of life is threatened when wind turbines are built. In all three cases, conflict arose due to different stakeholder interests, but a shared understanding of the landscape problems and need for solution formed a common starting point.  3.2.2 Does the approach allow for multiple land-use objectives? A second common element across cases is to manage for multifunctional land uses. The Dartmoor Vision for 2030 resulted in an agreement being reached between public and private actors to support a range of ecosystem services provided by the National Park. In Colmenar Viejo the municipality made its multiple landscape qualities an asset. Its rich cultural heritage and farming identity, the diverse geology and Mediterranean ecosystems, as well as the privileged location between Madrid and the Guadarrama Mountains triggered various ILM activities. These included activities such as regulating grazing activity, creating a sustainable water supply system for livestock, restoring cultural heritage and native vegetation cover, creating recreation opportunities based on the existing path network, and recovering vineyards. The value of the Solidarity Pacts of the Soonwald Nature Park is at the landscape level, that functions and incomes are diversified, while at the village level, limiting wind energy development to specific sites results in forest areas being perceived as remaining undisturbed and of high aesthetic and nature conservation value. The common aim of all initiatives is to fulfill multiple land management objectives, which requires negotiation of tradeoffs between actors who have varied visions and interests. However, the way negotiation processes have been organised varies, ranging from an intended bottom-up process (Dartmoor) to top-down management decisions (Colmenar Viejo, Soonwald).  3.2.3 Does the approach host multiple stakeholders and foster collaboration? Cooperation between public and private actors, such as land managers, agency representatives, and other stakeholders or civil society groups becomes institutionalised in the form of plans (Dartmoor, Colmenar Viejo) and contracts (Soonwald). The management plan in Dartmoor involves multiple stakeholders (e.g., land managers, landowners, commons associations, and DEFRA), and there is a clear process for them to collaborate on development and funding. As well as that, there are many opportunities for civil society to engage via the Commons Association. Similarly, the different activities present in Colmenar Viejo involve a range of stakeholders: administrative staff, experts and professionals, civil and cultural associations, schools, and the general public are involved as designers and participants in the activities for raising awareness and enhancing the cultural and natural heritage, whereas farmers, hunters, and other land users are part of an advisory board for the management of the countryside. The solidarity pacts bring in stakeholders from villages and municipal association authorities, as well as other stakeholders such as the state forest service. Thus, all initiatives involve multiple stakeholders, but to differing degrees and differences in decision-making power. Commonly, power rests with administrations while other stakeholder opinions are taken as contributions.  3.2.4 Does the approach take multiple administrative scales into account? Although each case focuses primarily on local level landscape management, higher administrative levels such as the regional (Soonwald) or State/national level (Dartmoor, Colmenar Viejo) are included. For example, the land management plan in Dartmoor enables collaboration between local farmers and the state agencies (Natural England and DEFRA) for the provisioning of various ecosystem services. A management committee is formed to agree on suitable outcomes, which takes into account the land-based ecosystem services that are provided on the local to regional scale. Multiple scales are also integrated in Colmenar Viejo, i.e. the local, regional and national level. A problem is that even when multiple scales are involved they largely follow a sectorial approach related to the restoration of heritage, e.g., regional and national heritage boards and EU schemes for nature conservation. The Solidarity Pacts in Soonwald recognise and connect at least two administrative scales (village and municipal association), and are often facilitated by representatives from the state administration. These multi-level governance characteristics are a common feature of all the cases. In how far multi-level refers also to multiple policy sectors varies.  3.2.5 Is the development of the solution and identification of tradeoffs transparent? As land-use decision-making requires trade-offs in priority setting and management objectives, differences in transparency are noteworthy. The integrated management initiative in Dartmoor provides the most explicitly transparent process for land managers to agree on land management actions that are aligned with specific management outcomes. The process enables managers to debate pathways and negotiate trade-offs. In the case of Colmenar Viejo, management decisions for recreational uses, nature conservation, and hunting and grazing activities are largely prescribed in a top-down manner with little room for negotiation. The advisory board for countryside management offers a platform for the different stakeholders to express their opinions on these management decisions, but the administration is under no obligation to make any changes. The case in Soonwald remains unclear in this regard. One legal agreement has been published on a municipal association website, but the process of developing the agreement has not been published, only the result. For all cases, even though the process of reaching the decisions is lacking in transparency and/or room for maneuver for negotiations (more for Colmenar Viejo, Soonwald, less for Dartmoor), the end results are binding for all.  3.2.6 Are clear rights and responsibilities assigned in the process? Even though diverse stakeholders cooperate over a range of scales and contexts, they rely on clearly defined structures and processes. This is most explicit in Dartmoor, where land managers and commons-rights owners enter into a contract with the management committee. The solidarity pacts, which are agreements that may last for thirty years, are also contract-based. While rights for wind energy development are not an inherent part of the contracts, they state that each signatory that benefits from wind energy must pay a certain percentage into the pot. In Colmenar Viejo, the different stakeholder groups’ rights and responsibilities are clearly defined in the Management Plan for most rangelands owned by the municipality (regulating, for example, the number of livestock, the months when hunting and grazing are allowed, and the methods and materials to be used for restoring drystone walls). The cases demonstrate that land management rights and responsibilities are clearly assigned. But the scope of these rights is relatively narrow for single functions, levels, and duties.  3.2.7 Does adaptive management and learning occur? Adaptive management as a way to adapt to changing context conditions (Folke, Hahn, Olsson, & Norberg, 2005 ) is recognised in the Dartmoor management plans, which are usually of five years duration and are reviewed on an annual or bi-annual basis. All parties are expected to visit sites prior to the review in order to obtain first-hand experience of the challenges and opportunities faced. A review of the program in 2013 revealed that the approach has led to a greater understanding of what agri-environmental schemes are trying to achieve (Silcock, Brunyee, & Pring, 2013 ). In contrast, a planned strategy for adaptive management is absent in Colmenar Viejo and in the solidarity pacts contracts. In the latter case, a reason can be their rather simple structure as they regulate mainly cash flows which should provide rather stability than flexibility. Also, wind energy development requires lasting administrative decisions and substantial investments in infrastructure that cannot easily be adapted to new circumstances. It appears in the three cases that the degree of flexibility and adaptation of management measures is highly determined either by the needs of participating stakeholders for stability (Soonwald, long-time contracts) versus flexible adjustments (Dartmoor). In Colmenar Viejo, the absence of adaptation can be explained by a lack of tradition in bottom-up landscape management.  3.2.8 Are participatory monitoring and capacity-building activities in place? Monitoring and capacity building activities are not explicitly addressed in any of the three cases, but they all refer to awareness raising efforts as an important element for landscape management. In Dartmoor, activities are oriented towards raising awareness among farmers about sustainable land management. For example, the Dartmoor Hill group invites speakers to talk about the concepts of natural capital and ecosystem services. Colmenar Viejo established, among many activities for public outreach, an annual Environment Day where hundreds of residents participate in conferences, photo contests, and guided walks organised by the Department of Environment of the municipality. For the solidarity pacts in Soonwald, we found no documented evidence of awareness raising activities. The defined range of participants may explain why such kind of capacity-building activity is not central to the surveyed ILM initiatives. Their local application scope suggests a lack of resources for monitoring as deficit. Table 2   gives an overview of the decisive key characteristics of ILM identified in the cases, and their degree of influence for conflict resolution.    4 Discussion Our conflict cases highlight the challenges of sustainable landscape management to fulfill diverse land-use objectives as called for in the SDGs (cf. Le Blanc, 2015 ). On the one hand there is the ideal of integrated thinking and systemic management solutions (cf. Milder et al., 2014; Sayer et al., 2013 ). On the other hand, these ideals are confronted with diverse realities and contexts that pose challenges for implementation. As we argued, land-use conflicts are expressions of diverse societal demands, which mirror the range of (in parts antagonistic) SDGs (Nilsson, Griggs, & Visbeck, 2016 ). These differences require dedicated formats for stakeholder exchange on management objectives and participatory decision-making processes for developing context sensitive solutions (e.g. Mann & Absher, 2014; Voß & Kemp, 2006 ). While ILM theoretically has the potential to identify tradeoffs and ease land-use conflicts, in practice, fulfilling the ILM requirements for conflict resolution is difficult (Hák, Janoušková, & Moldan, 2016 ). In the following, we discuss the preconditions for ILM that appear most important in the study cases for conflict resolution. 4.1 A common concern for landscape quality as a precondition for collaboration Continuous landscape degradation and a common concern for landscape quality were among the main reasons for stakeholder collaboration, serving as a point of entry for ILM initiatives (cf. Kozar, Buck, & Barrow, 2014 ). Land managers at the local level had a vital interest in sustaining their resource basis. Public authorities were interested in development, while also obliged to fulfill additional policy objectives, for instance, contributing to the transformation of the energy system or nature conservation. With the help of ILM approaches, the diversity of these traditional and newly emerging land-use objectives have been put explicitly into focus underlining the need for more open debate and collaboration. Although the analysed ILM approaches vary regarding the scope and responsibilities of participants, the idea is the same: To generate alternative solutions with help of multi-level and inter-sectoral coordination, and multi-stakeholder collaboration based on a shared problem understanding and mutual benefits (Keesstra et al., 2016 ). Collaboration then provides the basis for shared agreement, collective action and the formation of alliances and networks that build on trust. The rationale for ILM is to develop ownership, which might increase the chances of achieving these multiple land-use objectives. Ideally, stakeholder involvement occurs as co-designed approaches, starting from common problem identification, via visioning and prioritisation, up to co-implementation and monitoring (e.g. Klein, 2008; Mitchell, Cordell, & Fam, 2015 ). However, such collaborative governance requires dedicated resources to professionally take the diverse needs of actors, sectors and decision-making levels into account, which seems particularly problematic at the local and municipal level. Such lack of resources might be mitigated by State and national support.  4.2 A need for hybrid modes of landscape governance The aim of landscape governance is to expand cooperation between the state, as a central actor for guiding the provision of landscape services, and non-state actors (e.g. Beunen & Opdam, 2011 ). The design of the surveyed ILM solutions is characterised by hybrid modes of governance, which allows stakeholder participation, but also incorporates forms of hegemonic decision-making and closure of design processes. Examples are the case of Colmenar Viejo, where the local administration designs the management plan in a top-down way, similar to the contracts in Soonwald between villages and village associations. The opportunities for stakeholders to co-design these measures are varying. More advanced are the land management plans in Dartmoor. Here, the high degree of professionalism stems from the leading role played by national agencies in charge of the National Park which have resources and experience in developing co-operative and collaborative partnerships with diverse stakeholder groups (Raymond et al., 2016 ). Besides the degree of professionalism, also questions of design complexity played a decisive role. A lesson learned from the solidarity pact in Germany is that, compared to the other two cases, solidarity pacts are relatively simple measures as their application scope is narrowly defined. At their core, they enable the transfer of money for leasing land for development, assign clear responsibilities and connect a defined range of actors as contract parties. They do not need to incorporate exchange platforms for negotiating tradeoffs or build on informal rules for choosing land management options. Either a municipality decides to become part of them or not. On the other hand, as the same type of solidarity pact is applied for a range of different municipalities, they are less flexible for adaptation once they have been set up. In contrast, the more complex ILM approaches in Dartmoor and Colmenar Viejo build on their adapatability to take particular social-ecological particularities into account. As such, tradeoffs in ILM design become necessary to find a balance between standardised formats, on the one hand, and taking context variations into account, on the other. Here, the cases demonstrate that rather than a need for integrating all key characteristics for successful ILM design, it seems important to create solutions that fit the stakeholder needs and the application contexts with which management is supposed to work (cf. Waage et al., 2015 ).  4.3 ILM as a land-use conflict resolution approach How can ILM solve land-use conflicts and contribute as an implementation strategy for fulfilling SDG commitments in Europe? Due to continuous land use changes and the further diversification of land uses and users, the potential for land-use conflict is likely to increase. Many of the SDG objectives push also conflicting land-use trends forward in parallel, which has implications in particular on local and regional level. What seems appropriate for sustainable development is strongly contextual and determined by the actors concerned. As such, integration of objectives and collaboration of actors is key to implementing the SDGs (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). No blue print approach exits for ILM, or precise definitions of concrete formats (Reed et al., 2016 ). Rather we have shown that niches for experimentation, learning, and a constant improvement of measures is needed to find ways how to include the range of interests for the development of embedded management solutions “that work”. As such, the new landscape management plans and contracts are experiments with governance forms for generating more sustainable land management solutions (cf. Mann & Plieninger, 2017 ). This experimental character of ILM approaches underlines the need for careful monitoring and adaptation, which remains to be improved as in the Soonwald and Colmenar Viejo case. Hence the focus of ILM as a mean for SDG implementation need to be strengthened for experimentation and learning, which brings actors and organisations together for collective action and conflict resolution in relation to landscape management. As a way forward, more systematic assessment and adaptive land management approaches are needed (cf. Folke et al., 2005 ), which incorporate system dynamics, uncertainty and surprise in their design by using approaches that mobilize and combine different types of knowledge, feedback loops, and learning arrangements (Waltner-Toews & Kay, 2005 ). Insights gained from previous ILM approaches on landscape policy and practice could be systematically evaluated and used as the basis for designing and executing SDG appropriate measures (Freeman et al., 2015 ).   5 Conclusion While a scientific discourse on SDG implementation has gained momentum in the past few years (e.g. Hák et al., 2016; Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ), a socio-political discourse on SDG implementation in Europe is largely absent as much of the debate still focuses on the developing world. However, as the SDGs apply to all nations (e.g. Griggs et al., 2013; Le Blanc, 2015 ), implementation demands are about to come. ILM helps to foster debates about multiple landscape functions, services, and visions among concerned actors and inspires an exploration of a range of land-use options and synergies. It allows heterogeneous actors with different motivations and roles to constructively exchange options for landscape development and hence their visions of sustainable development that have been previously often left outside of decision-making processes. Furthermore, coordinated knowledge generation that better link social-ecological landscape research with practitioners knowledge and citizen science initiatives would improve not only the relevancy of research (Bonney & et al., 2014; Shaw, Draux, Garcia Martin, Martin, & Bieling, 2017 ), but also its societal embedding in working towards sound SDG implementation in European landscapes.
