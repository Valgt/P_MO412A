                  Ecosystems are an important basis for promoting sustainable development goals (SDGs) through the provision of stable ecosystem services (ESs). In the past 20 years, China has implemented a series of forestry ecological development projects, resulting in the improvement of the ecological environment. In this context, changes in ESs in China may affect the contribution of ecosystems to the SDGs, but there is a lack of research in this area. Studies have shown that ESs can support multiple SDGs, and quantifying the contribution of ecosystems to SDGs is currently a research focus. However, few studies have quantified the extent of the contribution of different ESs to the SDGs, although these differences are generally assumed. To narrow this knowledge gap, we construct an assessment approach that integrates the extent of the contribution of different ESs to the SDGs and assesses the temporal and spatial dynamics of the contribution of ESs to the SDGs in China from 2000 to 2020. Our analysis results indicate that during the study period, fractional vegetation cover improved in China. In general, water provision, soil conservation, and food provision services improved, while carbon storage and biodiversity maintenance services declined. The contribution capacity of provincial ecosystems to the SDGs increased, except in Tibet, between 2000 and 2020. Overall, the contributions to the SDGs had obvious spatial differences. The research results can support policy formulation and research on ES management and SDGs.

In the past 20 years, China has implemented a series of forestry ecological development projects, resulting in the improvement of the ecological environment. In this context, changes in ESs in China may affect the contribution of ecosystems to the SDGs, but there is a lack of research in this area. Studies have shown that ESs can support multiple SDGs, and quantifying the contribution of ecosystems to SDGs is currently a research focus. However, few studies have quantified the extent of the contribution of different ESs to the SDGs, although these differences are generally assumed. To narrow this knowledge gap, we construct an assessment approach that integrates the extent of the contribution of different ESs to the SDGs and assesses the temporal and spatial dynamics of the contribution of ESs to the SDGs in China from 2000 to 2020. Our analysis results indicate that during the study period, fractional vegetation cover improved in China. In general, water provision, soil conservation, and food provision services improved, while carbon storage and biodiversity maintenance services declined. The contribution capacity of provincial ecosystems to the SDGs increased, except in Tibet, between 2000 and 2020. Overall, the contributions to the SDGs had obvious spatial differences. The research results can support policy formulation and research on ES management and SDGs.

The global SDGs face serious challenges, such as heterogeneous development, excessive carbon emissions, and hunger. Ecosystem services (ESs) are the link between ecosystems and the SDGs that are crucial to the implementation of the SDGs (IPBES, 2016 ; ICSU, 2015 ; IUCN, 2020 ). ESs refer to the benefits directly or indirectly obtained by humans from the ecosystem, and ESs are the basis of human well-being; these services are divided into supplying, supporting, regulating, and culture services (Costanza et al., 1997 ; Daily et al., 2000 ; MA, 2005 ). Factors affecting ESs include modifications to vegetation, alterations in landscape patterns, natural disasters, and others (Hasan et al., 2021 ; Crespin et al., 2016 ; Yohannes et al., 2021 ). Since the 1970s, the Chinese government has launched a series of forestry ecological development projects, such as the Natural Forestry Protection Program, the Grain for Green Program, the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program and the Middle-lower Yangtze River Protection Forest Program, to improve the ecological environment (Song et al., 2022 ). In this context, vegetation conditions have been improved. Previous research has shown that vegetation change can have a significant impact on ESs such as soil conservation, biodiversity maintenance, and carbon storage (Kong et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2022b ; Lim et al., 2019 ). Most human needs, such as basic material needs (e.g.: food, water, and raw materials), cultural and spiritual needs, maintenance of biodiversity, and climate regulation, are supplied by diverse ESs (Wu, 2013 ). Achieving the SDGs requires a secure and sustainable supply of ESs (Yin et al., 2021 ). Alterations in vegetation status result in changes to ESs, thereby impacting the contribution of regional ecosystems to achieving SDGs. However, there is still a knowledge gap regarding the change in the contribution of ecosystems to the SDGs in China in recent decades. The paths of ESs supporting SDGs are diverse. Some ESs, such as food, freshwater supplies, and biodiversity maintenance, are themselves the main content of SDG2 (Zero Hunger), SDG6 (Clean Water), and SDG15 (Life on Land), respectively, and improving these ESs can directly contribute to the achievement of the corresponding SDGs. However, some ESs contribute to the SDGs through indirect effects. For example, improving soil conditions is conducive to food security, water security, and maintaining biodiversity, thus contributing to the achievement of the relevant SDGs (Keesstra et al., 2016 ). While multiple ESs can influence the same SDG, the ways and extent of the impact may differ. The relationships between different ESs and SDGs have been widely discussed (Yang et al., 2020 ). Some studies have qualitatively distinguished the differences in the impacts of different ESs on different SDGs. For example, Lynch et al. (2020)  distinguished the extent of the impacts of nine fishery-related ESs on different SDGs; Wang et al. (2022a)  distinguished the extent of the impacts of water pollution control on different SDGs; and Wood et al. (2018)  assessed the relationships between 16 ESs and SDGs, and distinguished the impacts of different ESs on SDGs. Based on the relationships between ESs and SDGs, numerous studies have assessed SDGs in various regions. For example, Chen (Chen et al., 2022 ) assessed the SDGs in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt, Liu (Liu et al., 2019 ) assessed the SDGs in China's Gansu Province, and Xu (Xu et al., 2021a ) assessed the SDGs in the Luanhe River Basin in China. However, these studies did not quantify the difference in the extent of the contribution of different ESs to SDGs. For this purpose, we constructed an approach for assessing the contributions of ecosystems to the SDGs in 31 provinces in China. In this study, we used an improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to convert the extent of the contribution of different ESs to the SDGs from qualitative to quantitative values. Our study aimed to: (1) assess the temporal and spatial differences in five key ESs across 31 Chinese provinces between 2000 and 2020; (2) quantify the extent of the contribution of different ESs to the SDGs; and (3) assess the temporal and spatial dynamics of the contribution of ESs to the SDGs in 31 provinces of China based on the integrated ES-SDG method.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area and data sources We selected 31 provincial administrative units in mainland China as the study areas (Fig. 1  ). The topography of China is low in the east and high in the west. Precipitation has significant regional characteristics and a gradual decrease from the southeastern coast to the northwestern inland. The natural and socioeconomic data used in this study are shown in Table 1  .  2.2 The change in fractional vegetation cover Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) represents the percentage of the vertical projected area of vegetation (including leaves, branches, and stems) on the ground to the size of the local area (Gitelson et al., 2002 ). It is widely used as an indicator of the state of surface vegetation (Tang et al., 2022 ). This study focused on the changes in FVC during the implementation of forestry engineering projects. To exclude the influence of FVC in farmland, we considered only the changes in FVC in non-farmland areas. Based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, formula (1)  was used to calculate the FVC in each province (Carlson and Ripley, 1997 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ).(1) FVC = NDVI − NDVI soil    / NDVI v e g   − NDVI soil       where NDVI is the normalized differential vegetation index of pixels, and NDVIsoil  and NDVIveg  represent the minimum NDVI value of bare soil pixels and the maximum value of NDVI value of pixels with complete vegetation cover, respectively.  2.3 Quantifying ecosystem services In this study, we used the InVEST model, the USLE equation, and other methods to assess the ESs in the study area. The detailed methods are displayed in Supplementary materials S1 . In this study, we used the InVEST model, the USLE equation, and other methods to assess the ESs in the study area. The detailed methods are displayed in Supplementary materials S1. 2.3.1 Carbon storage The InVEST model was used to assess carbon storage services according to four carbon densities for different land use types, including aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil organic matter, and dead organic matter (Sharp et al., 2020 ). The formula is as follows:(2) C total  = C above  + C below  + C soil  + C dead     where C total    is the total carbon stock, C above    is the aboveground carbon stock, C below    is the belowground carbon stock, C dead    is the dead organic matter carbon stock, and C soil    is the soil carbon stock.  2.3.2 Food provision Previous studies have indicated a significant linear relationship between the NDVI and the production of multiple foods (Kuri et al., 2014 ). Therefore, a land use type-based approach was used to assess food production services in the study area. The total output of grain was allocated to farmland according to the NDVI value required to produce these foods.(3) G ij  = NDVI ij  NDVI sum   ∙ G sum     where Gij   is the output of the crop allocated by the i-th grid, and Gsum   is the total output of the crop products. NDVIij   is the NDVI value of the ith grid, and NDVIsum   is the sum of the NDVI values of the crop products.  2.3.3 Water provision The InVEST model assesses the water yield of each grid by subtracting its actual evapotranspiration from the precipitation and then adding to obtain the total water production of the study area.(4) Y xj  = 1 − AET xj  P x     ∙ P x     where Y xj   is the water yield for pixel x , and AET xj   is the actual annual evapotranspiration on pixel x  (Xiang et al., 2020 ).  2.3.4 Biodiversity maintenance The habitat quality module of the InVEST model was used to assess the habitat quality in the study area. The model reflects the sustainability and resilience of regional biodiversity through habitat quality values. High habitat quality values represent regions that can better support biodiversity development. We used habitat quality to represent the biodiversity maintenance services of ecosystems in our study.(5) Q xj  = H j  1 − D xy z  D xj z  + k z          where Q xj    represents the habitat quality for each grid in land use type j ; D xj    represents the degree of degradation for each grid in land use type j ; K  is the half-saturation constant; and Z  is the scaling parameter (Bai et al., 2018 ).  2.3.5 Soil conservation We used the USLE to assess soil conservation services in the study area (Dabney et al., 2012 ):(6) SR = R ∙ K ∙ LS − R ∙ K ∙ LS ∙ C ∙ P    where R  is the rainfall erosivity, K  is the soil erodibility, LS  is the topographic factor, C  is the land cover factor, P  is the soil and water provision measures factor.  2.3.6 Model validation To assess the accuracy of the simulation results, we used data from 40 prefecture-level cities in the study area to verify the simulation results of the ES models. We selected the water production data from the Water Resources Bulletin published by the Ministry of Water Resources of China to verify the simulation data. There was significant consistency between the verified values and simulated values (R2  = 0.94, n = 40, p < 0.01; Fig. 2 a ). Published data on forest carbon storage in China were used to verify the simulated values (Chen et al., 2023b ) (Table 1 ), and there was significant consistency between the verified values and simulated values (R2  = 0.81, n = 40, p < 0.01; Fig. 2 b). The published soil retention data in China were used to verify the simulated values (Li et al., 2023 ) (Table 1 ), and there was significant consistency between the verified values and simulated values (R2  = 0.77, n = 40, p < 0.01; Fig. 2 c). As the NDVI can be an important indicator of regional vegetation cover and ecological quality, this study used the NDVI to verify the simulated habitat quality values. There was significant consistency between the verified values and simulated values (R2  = 0.55, n = 40, p < 0.01; Fig. 2 d).   2.4 Assessing the contribution of the ecosystem to the SDGs 2.4.1 Normalization The data were normalized in the assessment process due to differences in units, dimensions, and measurement methods (Sachs et al., 2018 ). To eliminate the differences in each ES, we used formulas (7)–(8)  to normalize the biophysical values to range between 0 and 100.(7) ES i ′  = ES i  − Min ES i     Max ES i   − Min ES i     × 100    (8) ES i ′  = Max ES i   − ES i    Max ES i   − Min ES i     × 100    where ES i ′    and ES i    refer to normalized values and biophysical values, respectively. Max(ES i   ) and Min(ES i   ) refer to the maximum and minimum biophysical values, respectively.  2.4.2 Associated values between ecosystem services and SDG targets This study used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to quantify the degree of association between different ESs and the SDG targets. The AHP was developed by Saaty in 1980 to manage the transformation of information from qualitative to quantitative (Wen et al., 2020 ). The main steps of this method include building a hierarchical model, selecting an appropriate judgment scale, and determining the relative importance of different elements through pairwise comparisons. 2.4.2.1 Building the hierarchical model In the hierarchical model of this study, the contribution degree of the ecosystem to the SDGs was the highest, followed by the contribution degree of the ecosystem to the targets (Fig. 3  ).  2.4.2.2 Selecting an appropriate judgment scale and building a judgment matrix The nine-point comparison scale proposed by Saaty was used as the judgment scale. As shown in Table 3 , one point indicates that the two compared factors have equal importance, and nine points indicate that one factor is more important than the other to the greatest possible degree; the value represents the degree of relative importance. Through a pairwise comparison of the degree of influence of n ESs on SDG targets, an n by n judgment matrix can be built in which the diagonal elements are always 1. The basis for pairwise comparison comes from existing studies (Wood et al., 2018 ), which define the qualitative relationship between these ESs and the targets of SDGs at three levels. In our study, these relationships were described as strong, medium, and weak. We use the numeric of scheme 5 in Table 3  to convert this qualitative relationship into a quantitative relationship. We determined the most suitable judgment scale from the five schemes through multiple rounds of testing. We calculated the CR values of the five schemes, as shown in Table 3 . The result showed that scheme 5 had the minimum CR value. According to the definition by Saaty, the scheme with the lowest CR value is most suitable for human psychology and logic, so we chose scheme 5 as the judgment scale in this study. That is, when an ES has the same degree of impact on targets A and B, the comparison value between the two is 1. When an ES has a strong impact on A and a weak impact on B, the value is 9. When an ES has a strong impact on A and a medium impact on B, the value is 3. When an ES has a medium impact on A and a weak impact on B, the value is 3.  2.4.2.3 Calculation and verification A series of judgments based on pairwise comparison and relative importance were made (Lee et al., 2006 ). After establishing the judgment matrix, it was necessary to perform a consistency test to overcome the inconsistency in ratings. Consistency ratios (CRs) were calculated using formulas (9)–(10)  to measure the degree of contradiction for each factor in the judgment matrix of each factor (Ho, 2008 ).(9) Consistency Ratio : CR = CI RI     (10) Consistency Index : CI = λ max  − n  n − 1      where λ max    is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix, and n is the number of ESs affecting each SDG target. If CR < 0.10, then the judgment matrix value is considered to fall within an acceptable range. The random indices proposed by Saaty are shown in Table 2  .      2.4.3 The contribution of ecosystem services to the SDGs The contribution values of ESs to the SDGs were equal to the average contribution value of each SDG. The contribution value to each SDG was the sum of the contribution value of the targets of this SDG.(11) CV targetj  = ∑ i = 1  n  ES i  × x i        Formula (11)  was used to calculate the contribution value for target j , where ES i   is the value of ES i after normalization, and x i   is the association value between the target j  and ES i.    3 Results 3.1 Temporal and spatial variations in ecosystem services We quantified the values of ESs in 31 provinces in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. The ESs in China displayed obvious spatial heterogeneity. Overall, the average values of water provision, soil retention, biodiversity maintenance, and carbon storage were higher in southern provinces than in northern provinces. Among the northern provinces, the average value of the four ESs (water provision, soil retention, biodiversity maintenance, carbon storage) in Northeast China was higher than that in North China and Northwest China (Fig. 5 ). This result is consistent with the law of precipitation and forest distribution in China. From 2000 to 2020, the performance of ecosystem water provision, soil retention, and food provision services improved at the national level. The water provision increased from 237.49 mm to 265.99 mm, the soil retention increased from 502.26 t/km2  to 505.72 t/km2 , and the food provision increased from 256.88 t/km2  to 372.23 t/km2  (Table S2-1). Biodiversity maintenance and carbon storage decreased. The biodiversity maintenance ranged from 0.5484 to 0.5269, and the carbon storage ranged from 8603.99 Mg/km2  to 8335.69 Mg/km2  (Table S2-1). At the provincial level, food provision and soil retention increased in most provinces, and biodiversity maintenance and carbon storage decreased in most provinces. Water provision increased in most provinces, but in Fujian, Guangdong, Hainan, and Yunnan, it decreased obviously, by >40 mm (Fig. 6 ).  3.2 The relationships between the FVC and ESs FVC is an important indicator that reflects the status of surface vegetation. In this study, we calculated the FVC based on NDVI data to explore the changes in vegetation status in each province under the background of forestry project implementation from 2000 to 2020. Specifically, we calculated the correlation coefficients between the FVC and ESs. Our results showed a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between water provisoin and FVC in seven of the 31 provinces (Table 4 ). There was a significant positive correlation between soil retention and FVC in seven provinces, a significant positive correlation between food provision and FVC in 13 provinces, a significant negative correlation between biodiversity maintenance and FVC in 10 provinces, a significant positive correlation in one province, and a significant negative correlation between carbon storage and FVC in 13 provinces.  3.3 Temporal and spatial variations in the SDGs Based on the research results shown in Fig. 4  , the qualitative relationships between ESs and the SDG targets were assessed. The AHP was used to quantify the different extent of relationships, and the associated values are shown in Table 5 . The larger the associated values are, the more significant the impact of the ES on the corresponding target is, and vice versa. Our results showed that the cumulative associated values for the five ESs of food provision, biodiversity maintenance, water provision, carbon storage, and soil retention were 10.77, 10.65, 9.72, 7.93, and 4.92, respectively. These results indicate that food provision has had the largest impact on the SDGs and that soil retention has had the weakest influence in this study. According to the standard values of ESs and associated values, we adopted formula （11）  to calculate the SDG index values for the provinces. This variable represents the ecosystem's contribution to SDGs, ranging from 0 to 100. Our results showed that the SDGs index of most provinces exhibited an increasing trend overall (Fig. 7 ). The national SDGs index increased from 38.89 in 2000 to 47.40 in 2020. SDG12 had the fastest growth, from 40.41 in 2000 to 58.08 in 2020, and SDG9 had the least growth, from 37.53 to 40.56. At the provincial level, there were significant spatial and temporal differences. From 2000 to 2020, only the SDGs index of Tibet decreased, and the SDGs index of other provinces all increased. The SDGs index of Anhui, Liaoning, Gansu, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Ningxia, and Chongqing increased by >10, and those of Beijing, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Hainan, Fujian, Shanghai, and Tibet increased by <5.   4 Discussion 4.1 Vegetation restoration and ES trends FVC increased between 2000 and 2020 in China. Additionally, in this period, the three ESs of water provision, soil conservation, and food provision displayed overall increases, and biodiversity maintenance decreased; these findings were consistent with those of previous studies at the national scale (Ouyang et al., 2016 ). Several studies have shown that vegetation can intercept precipitation through the canopy and litter layer, reduce runoff and increase rainwater infiltration, thus preventing soil loss and increasing water provision (Chen et al., 2020 ; Liu et al., 2008 ). This may contribute to the increase in water provision services (Fig. 5  ). However, the increase in vegetation cover may lead to increases in actual evapotranspiration and the infiltration capacity in some areas, which may lead to a decrease in the regional water yield (Luo et al., 2019 ). In addition, precipitation is an important factor affecting the water yield, especially in areas with abundant precipitation, where precipitation varies significantly between different years. Examples include Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Yunnan. This may explain the inconsistent changes in water provision services in our results.   Studies have shown that vegetation cover helps maintain soil fertility by reducing runoff and soil erosion and reducing river sediment inputs (Ricke et al., 2018 ; Jia et al., 2014 ). This could explain the improvement in soil retention services observed in this study, especially in the northern provinces, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia. These provinces are in the three North Shelterbelt project areas (Fig. 1 ). The project is the largest afforestation project to date globally and aims to improve the local ecological environment (Zhai et al., 2023 ; Pan et al., 2011 ). Many studies have shown that soil retention services have been improved in the Three North Shelterbelt project area, which is consistent with our results (Jiang et al., 2019 ; Yue et al., 2014 ; Li et al., 2021 ). Restoration of vegetation improves the water and soil conditions of ecosystems, which may indirectly increase crop yields. This may be one reason for the increase in food services. Land use changes are the main drivers of carbon storage changes (Medeiros et al., 2020 ; Andriamananjara et al., 2016 ., Tang et al., 2020 ). Although studies have found that increasing vegetation coverage creates beneficial carbon storage in some areas (Yang et al., 2019 ), at the terrestrial ecosystem scale, changes in carbon storage are mainly related to changes in land use; therefore, the research results in this study cannot fully reflect the effect of vegetation coverage change on carbon storage. The decrease in carbon storage was due to the increases in grassland loss and construction land expansion in this study. Similarly, the habitat quality of the InVEST model was calculated based on land use data, so the research results did not directly reflect the impact of vegetation restoration on biodiversity. The changes in land use and cover and the decrease in ecosystem connectivity were the main reasons for the degradation of habitat quality (Cao et al., 2019 ; Declerck et al., 2013 ; Chen et al., 2023a ).  4.2 Contributions to the sustainable development goals In this study, we quantified the ESs provided by the ecosystem and translated the corresponding effects into contributions to the SDGs. The vast territory of China, the different natural resource endowments in each province, and the differences in the level of economic development and policy implementation resulted in significant spatial differences in the contributions of the ecosystem to the SDGs (Ortuño-Padilla et al., 2017 ). In general, the spatial pattern of the contribution of ecosystems to the SDGs was higher in southern provinces and higher in northeastern provinces than in other northern provinces. This spatial difference is consistent with the spatial pattern of decreasing precipitation from the southeast coast to the northwest inland of China. Meanwhile, forest resources were concentrated mainly in Southwest, Central, South and Northeast China. In North China, farmland and construction land occupied a large proportion of areas. In Northwest China, unused land (including desert, Gobi, etc.) and grassland occupied large areas, and forest resources were relatively scarce. These differences led to spatial differences in the contribution of the ecosystem to the SDGs. For policymakers, it is important to determine how to manage the ecosystem to promote sustainable development when an SDG deviates from expectations. Quantifying the extent of the contribution of different ESs to the SDGs is conducive to enhancing ecosystem management and achieving the SDGs. For example, when there are trade-offs among ESs, the contributions of ESs to SDGs can be used as a reference to best achieve the SDGs. This study provides methods and data support for SDG monitoring work from the national level to subnational, specific industry and sector levels. This shift is essential for achieving the SDGs (Guenat et al., 2022 , Rosato et al., 2021 , Yin et al., 2022 ). A lack of data and the localization of an assessment framework when assessing different regions or scales are challenges in SDG assessments (Huan et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2021b ; Lozano et al., 2018 , Allen et al., 2017 ). Our research method is based on Earth observation data, which are readily available and have a wide application range. Therefore, this method can be applied to other regions of the world and in studies of different scales. Another implication of this study for ecological engineering is promoting the improvement of the ability of ecosystems to sustainably supply ESs in response to specific needs to maximize the achievement of the SDGs.  4.3 Limitations There are still some challenges and limitations in our research that need to be addressed in future research. First, the interactions among the SDGs were not considered, although studies have demonstrated synergies and trade-offs among multiple SDGs (Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). Second, in this study, the selection of ESs affected the assessment results. There are a wide variety of ESs, but due to data availability limitations, only five ecosystem services were considered in this study. The relationship between vegetation restoration and ESs is not independent and may be nonlinear, and understanding such a complex relationship requires multifactor analysis. Incorporating the interactions (synergistic and trade-off) among SDGs and including more ESs into the proposed assessment method are future research directions.   5 Conclusions The primary purpose of forestry ecological development projects is to improve and promote the sustainable provision of ESs. This is consistent with the concept of the SDGs. Assessing and quantifying the temporal and spatial changes in ESs and their impacts on the SDGs at the provincial level in China can provide data and theoretical support for ecological engineering. This study quantified the ESs provided by different provinces in China in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. The analytic hierarchy process method was adopted to quantify the relationships between SDG targets and ESs. The temporal and spatial changes in the contributions of the ecosystem to the SDGs in 31 provinces of China were assessed. The contribution values of the ESs to the SDGs had significant spatiotemporal differences.
