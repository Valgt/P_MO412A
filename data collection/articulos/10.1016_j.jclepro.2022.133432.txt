                  Food waste reduction at consumer end and balanced, sustainable healthy dietary choices featuring less meat and less processed food have clear climate change mitigation benefits. This paper synthesises the existing body of literature (2015 to 2022) following systematic evidence search and screening using Scopus database and Google Scholar to explore the link of these two demand side mitigation options with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Assessment shows that these mitigation options not only have synergies with energy saving (SDG 7) goal but are intricately linked with awareness and educational programmes (SDG 4 and SDG 12) along with technological solutions/innovation (SDG 9), much broader innovative policy designs (SDG 16) going beyond market incentives, and involvement of multiple social actors (SDG 17). In aggregate, synergies with the SDGs outweigh trade-offs. Trade-offs can be addressed through policy measures, strategic information sharing, creating partnerships among social actors. Specific interventions related to these two demand-side mitigation options are categorised using ‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’ and ‘Improve’ framework. This framework helps in categorising interventions/policy measures leading to various levels of emission reduction: incremental reduction through ‘Shift’ and ‘Improve’ interventions and absolute reduction through ‘Avoid’ interventions. A total of 92 interventions are identified. We summarised the social actors involved in implementing these interventions for each of the ‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’ and ‘Improve’ categories and outlined the scope for future research.

This paper synthesises the existing body of literature (2015 to 2022) following systematic evidence search and screening using Scopus database and Google Scholar to explore the link of these two demand side mitigation options with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Assessment shows that these mitigation options not only have synergies with energy saving (SDG 7) goal but are intricately linked with awareness and educational programmes (SDG 4 and SDG 12) along with technological solutions/innovation (SDG 9), much broader innovative policy designs (SDG 16) going beyond market incentives, and involvement of multiple social actors (SDG 17). In aggregate, synergies with the SDGs outweigh trade-offs. Trade-offs can be addressed through policy measures, strategic information sharing, creating partnerships among social actors. Specific interventions related to these two demand-side mitigation options are categorised using ‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’  and ‘Improve’  framework. This framework helps in categorising interventions/policy measures leading to various levels of emission reduction: incremental reduction through ‘Shift’  and ‘Improve’  interventions and absolute reduction through ‘Avoid’  interventions. A total of 92 interventions are identified. We summarised the social actors involved in implementing these interventions for each of the ‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’  and ‘Improve’  categories and outlined the scope for future research.

Researchers (Malek et al., 2019 ; Taufik, 2018 ; West et al., 2014 ; Roy and Pal, 2009 ) have for long time been drawing attention to these non-supply side options for broadening mitigation actions. IPCC (2022)  has assessed quantitative potential of demand side interventions highlighting the role of socio-cultural factors, infrastructure access in shaping individual dietary choices and potential co-benefits. Demand side mitigation options include interventions focusing on socio-cultural factors, behaviour, lifestyle choices, changes in consumption pattern and level through individual and managerial intervention, new service delivery modes (e.g., packaging reductions, new ways of marketing, presentation of choices), infrastructure access (IPCC, 2022 ) and associated socio-technical transitions (Roy et al., 2021 ; Creutzig et al., 2020 , 2018 ; Rosenzweig et al., 2020 ; IPCC, 2019 ). It is important to understand what different actions can influence human behaviour, choices, decisions towards food waste reduction and dietary choices (Banerjee and John, 2021 ; Creutzig et al., 2018 ). While aiming for higher and faster mitigation actions, an important issue to understand is how various mitigation actions interact with the near-term targets of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which also addresses context specific targets for human wellbeing (Creutzig et al., 2022 ). Co-benefits from low demand climate mitigation options are also in discussion for over a decade now in the scientific community (Roy et al., 2012 , 2021 ; Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2014 ). Global scale assessments based on large number of scientific peer reviewed publications (IPCC, 2022 ; Frank et al., 2021 ; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019 ; Roy et al., 2018 ) and rapid literature review on various mitigation options and their SDG links show positive links (synergies) with SDGs clearly outweigh negative links (trade-offs). However, all these past studies have considered supply-side and demand-side options at higher levels of aggregation or for select groups of options and did not consider detailed granular options/interventions in the selected domain of food and diet comprehensively. Identifying the universe of possible mitigation interventions is important for implementation of actions. The Avoid-Shift-Improve (A-S-I) framework classify these interventions and helps in structuring policy measures as it reflects various levels of emission reduction: incremental reduction for ‘Shift’  and ‘Improve’  interventions and absolute reduction for ‘Avoid’  interventions (Creutzig et al., 2022 ). This framework, is therefore useful to understand investment priorities, institutional roles (market, non-market, regulatory) and role of managers, choice architectures (IPCC, 2022 ) which goes beyond individual consumers. Identification of key social actors (‘change agents’  in the society) who can externally trigger the changes is crucial. Existing literature do not present this comprehensively and systematically for two demand side mitigation options: food waste reduction at consumer end (only edible part, see FAO, 2011 ) and changing dietary choices towards balanced sustainable healthy diets featuring less meat and less processed food. There is no literature that provides a three-dimensional view of these two mitigation options: how are these two broad categories of options linked with the SDGs? What are the possible actions/interventions under each option and in which A-S-I category they belong to? Who is/are the primary social actors/‘change agents’  to trigger the change? Contribution of this paper to the existing literature is in bridging this knowledge gap. In this backdrop, the objectives of this paper are three-fold: (1) understanding the links with SDGs for the two mitigation options: food waste reduction at consumer level, and balanced, sustainable healthy dietary choices featuring less meat and less processed food (results are presented in section 3.2 ), (2) identifying the interventions and classifying them into A-S-I categories (results are in section 3.3 ) (3) identifying and summarising social actors to help in understanding the target group in policy framing, and types of interventions for scaling up (results are in section 3.4 ). Methods followed in deriving the results are described in section 2 . Discussion and conclusions are in sections 4 and 5  respectively.  2 Methods In the existing literature, food waste reduction is a prominent strategy for resource saving, conservation, efficiency, intra and intergenerational equity issues, indication of incompleteness of market incentives, and also fits into the overarching goal of sustainable development (Creutzig et al., 2022 ; Hanley et al., 1997 ; Ethridge, 1973 ; Georgescu-Roegen, 1971 ). Over the past many decades this body of literature, both from theoretical and empirical perspective, has proliferated to show how both in the case of relative and absolute scarcity reduction of waste is a precondition for sustainable development. They are featuring in large global assessments (Pathak et al., 2022 ) and in innovative policy framework through waste hierarchy definitions. Strategies of circularity have been most comprehensively suggested by NEEA (Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency) which define ten strategies- Refuse, rethink, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, recover (Creutzig et al., 2022 ). In case of relative scarcity, it reduces both private and social cost to the system. This fits into the ‘Improve’  and ‘Shift’  categories in this paper. In case of absolute scarcity not only waste reduction but reduction in overall resource use is a precondition for sustainability. This fits into the ‘Avoid’  category of this paper. By overcoming linearity in production system through recycling, technology innovation and infrastructure innovation, waste stream can be minimised (Fischedick et al., 2014 ). There are various related approaches in the literature such a circular material flow approach, industrial ecology approach. Literature and actions in the field of energy efficiency has evolved around this principle over many years (Saunders et al., 2021 ). Literature on the benefits of sustainable dietary choices is also growing exponentially. This motivated us to synthesise the emerging literature from independent researchers from various countries and contexts to bridge the existing knowledge gaps. For doing this, we undertook a systematic search and screening of the existing literature on food waste reduction at the consumer end and changes in dietary choice towards balanced sustainable diet featuring less meat and less processed food to synthesise evidences. This synthesis follows a rapid review of the literature published between 2015 and March 7, 2022. Elsevier's Scopus database is used for systematic search and Google Scholar is used for a focused search. The review methodology is explained in section 2.1  and Supplementary Material (SM) 1 in details for transparency and objectivity (Roy et al., 2021 ; Haddaway et al., 2015 ). Next, we reviewed the literature and mapped the synergies and trade-offs with the SDGs excluding SDG 13 which is on climate action. Here, we are mapping climate actions (i.e., the two demand side mitigation options) with the other sixteen SDGs. The methodology used to link these options with the SDGs largely builds on Roy et al. (2018) , which was also applied in Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2019) , Some (2020)  and similar approach was also followed in Honegger et al. (2021)  and Creutzig et al. (2022) . We explain it in sub-section 2.2 . Lastly, we identify various interventions identified from the articles, classify them into A-S-I framework following Roy et al. (2021)  and further into the social actors (‘change agents’ ). The workflow chart is shown in Fig. 1  . 2.1 Review methodology Review methodology involves various steps starting from construction of search queries, article screening, data/information extraction to synthesis of findings. Based on our research objectives, first we construct search queries (see Table SM.1 in Supplementary Material (SM) 1 for details). We have two different sets of queries; one for food waste reduction and another for changes in dietary choices towards less meat and less processed food. Article screening is done following inclusion-exclusion criteria in a three-step hierarchical process: title, abstract and then full text (see Table SM.2 in SM1 for details). In the last step of article screening (Fig. 1 ), we recorded relevant information from each of the included study in a spreadsheet (see SM2) and a word document for cross checking (see SM3). The information recorded include.• Dimension 1: mapping food waste reduction at consumer end and changing dietary choices with the SDGs and its targets, quoting texts from the articles as synergies and trade-offs (for details see subsection 2.2  and SM4). We use the same spreadsheet format as used in the chapter 5 of IPCC SR1.5 (Roy et al., 2018 ).  • Dimension 2: identifying interventions and classifying them into A-S-I framework (see SM5)  • Dimension 3: identifying the social actors (see SM5) who can implement these interventions     2.2 Links with SDGs and assessment methodology We follow three steps for assessing the link between the two demand-side mitigation options with the SDGs. First, the direction (positive or negative) of the (direct) link is recorded; positive links i.e., synergies are assigned a green upward arrow and negative links i.e., trade-offs are assigned a red downward arrow (see the ‘Interaction’ cell in SM4) For any specific SDG, if we find that the literature indicates both synergies and trade-offs then we assign two arrows: green upward arrow and red downward arrow, separated by ‘/’. Associated targets of SDGs are reported as ‘Targets’ in SM4. Second, an impact score is assigned depending on the strength of the impacts (see the ‘Nilsson Score’ cell in SM4). The score (Nilsson et al., 2016 ) is based on a 7- point rating-scale (see Table 1  ). Synergies are assigned a score of +1 (enabling), +2 (reinforcing), or +3 (indivisible), while trade-offs are assigned a score of −1 (constraining), −2 (counteracting), or −3 (cancelling). Thus, the magnitude of the score, irrespective of the sign, provides an indication of strength of the link between the two demand-side option and the SDGs (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019 ; Some, 2020 ; Roy et al., 2018 ). The reviewed literature do not specifically use the scores and links mentioned above, assignment of impact score in this review is based on the judgement of the claims of links mentioned in the reviewed literature by all the authors two of whom had been associated with the earlier review processes of the past studies mentioned above. Therefore, it may appear as subjective allocation of scores, however, the adopted methodology is stated in details with full transparency and the definitions provide scope of objectivity in choice of scores. So, four persons checking and coming in consensus makes the assessment stronger. To maintain consistency in this paper we laid down some rules following Nilsson et al. (2016) : the highest positive score (+3) is assigned if the literature indicates that an intervention is intricately related with achievement of any specific SDG. If an intervention help/aid in achieving an SDG then (+2) is assigned. (+1) is assigned when evidences show that an intervention has potential/actually advances a specific SDG. The lowest negative link score (−3) is assigned if evidences point out that an intervention makes it impossible to achieve a particular SDG. (−2) is assigned if evidences show that an intervention act against the achievement of an SDG while (−1) is assigned if an intervention may limit the achievement of an SDG. (0) is assigned if the literature base suggests that intervention has no impact on a particular SDG. If literature indicates both synergies and trade-offs then we assigned positive and negative scores together. In the last step, the level of confidence is assessed depending on the number of evidence extracted (i.e., articles) and literature agreement (see the ‘evidence’, ‘agreement’ and ‘confidence’ cells in SM4 and Table 2  ). Very high confidence (5-stars) implies robust evidence and high agreement. Similarly, very low confidence (1-star) depicts both low literature agreement and evidence (Mastrandrea et al., 2010 ). Based on the scores and the level of confidence we create the SDG chart (see Fig. 2   in subsection 3.2 ) to visually represent the synergies and trade-offs for the two demand-side mitigation options with the SDGs.   3 Results 3.1 Review descriptive statistics The search queries fetched a total of 1093 articles (for details see Table SM.1 in SM1). After three steps of screening, a total of 211 (2.1% of total) articles are found relevant for in-dept assessment (Table SM.3 in SM1). These 211 articles are from 31 different countries, 2, 5, and 24 articles are from multiple countries in Africa, Europe, and around the world, respectively. 9 are Global studies while 45 articles not specifying any geographic location. Most studied countries are the USA (n = 16), followed by UK (each with n = 15) (see figure SM.1 in SM1). 66 articles include interview/survey/focused group discussion-based studies, 56 are review-based articles, 49 articles include qualitative analysis, mixed methods and experiment-based analysis, 28 articles are based on quantitative analysis which include measurement of environmental footprint/other modelling analysis, and 12 articles are on scenario analysis.  3.2 Link with SDGs This subsection explains the links between the two demand-side mitigation options with the sixteen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 3.2.1 Food waste reduction at consumer end Review results clearly show food waste reduction helps in reducing resource use (SDG 8) like irrigation water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7) and cropland. Making incremental changes in food waste reduction through sharing of leftovers reduces poverty (SDG 1) and hunger, thereby increasing food security (SDG 2). These changes have been brought through awareness campaigns and education programs (SDG 4), consumers having access to relevant information and awareness regarding other alternatives to food waste like recycle and reuse (SDG 12) (for case studies, see subsection 3.4.1 ). Local level policies (SDG 16; SDG 17) are required to implement food waste recycling interventions like composting and proper food waste management (SDG 11). Furthermore, upgraded technological solutions/innovation (SDG 9) like smart fridge, fridge cameras (Schanes et al., 2018 ), innovative packaging (like downsized packages, multipacks) are also reported as effective (Zeng and Durif, 2020 ). This mitigation option may lead to some trade-offs with resource use through rebound effect. Studies (Reynolds et al., 2019a ; b ) have pointed out that reusing leftovers as next day lunch have chances of rebound effect i.e. this will save money which can be used for other types of consumption having negative environmental impact (SDG 12). This is a well-documented observation in energy efficiency related rebound effect literature also (Chakravarty et al., 2013 ).Trying to nudge consumer's behaviour to avoid food wastage by displaying posters in public eating places like canteens or cafeterias may lead to increased calorie intake (Lorenz-Walther et al., 2019 ), if the food proportion on plate is more than the required amount thereby affecting health adversely (SDG 3) (Alsaffar, 2016 ) so some understanding of the health impacts of over consumption is also needed. No direct link has been found with SDGs 5, 10 and 14 (Fig. 2 ). Overall, most of the links are reinforcing in nature (Table 1 ) thereby aiding the achievement of these SDGs.  3.2.2 Changing dietary choices towards balanced sustainable healthy diet featuring less meat and less processed food Consuming meat substitutes like plant-based alternatives (legumes), insects, sea-foods improves nourishment, health (SDG 3) and also enhances food security (SDG 2). Seasonal food lowers the risk of serious health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer (Żakowska-Biemans et al., 2019 ). Any reduction in meat consumption reduces the amount of energy required to produce animal feed and also in processing, transport, and distribution of meat and is therefore energy saving (SDG 7). Shifting towards plant and insect-based diets leads to water saving and reduce water pollution that occurs from slaughter houses (SDG 6) and less land use (SDGs 12, 15).  There are few trade-offs related to SDGs 1, 2, 8, 12, 14 and 15. Marques et al. (2018)  pointed out that decrease in meat consumption may have negative impact on the economic growth of poorer countries who export meat products or those whose livelihood depend on livestock sector (SDGs 1, 2, 8). Therefore, providing social protection to pastoral communities and having nationally recommended diet plans for population suffering from malnutrition will help to minimise these trade-offs (Creutzig et al., 2022 ). Halldórsdóttir and Nicholas (2016)  highlighted that locally produced cereals in Iceland may increase resource use like fertiliser (SDGs 8, 12, 15). Replacing meat completely with sea foods (ocean-based protein) may lead to overfishing, ocean acidification (SDG 14) and unplanned aquaculture which can cause invasion of alien species (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019 ). These trade-offs can be minimised with expert consultation, inclusive management policies, monitoring and effective planning. Educating people (SDG 4) via information campaigns, e-mails, posters etc. regarding the benefits of reducing meat and other processed food and having plant-based and less processed food are important. Partnership of policymakers and other stakeholders (consumers, producers, retailers and researchers) at national and international level (SDG 16 and 17) is required to achieve a mass shift towards diet featuring less meat and less processed food.  Policies for promoting sustainable, balanced healthy consumption pattern (USDA, 2019 ) are already in place (SDG 16). More than 100 countries have developed their food and dietary guidelines based on their food availability, culinary culture and eating habits. (FAO, 2020 ). Revisiting them and promoting those in creating awareness from both health and environment benefit perspective will help in strengthening climate actions and social norms. The number of synergies exceed number of trade-offs. Most of the links are reinforcing in nature but SDG 4, 7, 16 and 17 are inextricably linked (see Table 1 ).   3.3 Interventions categorised into avoid-shift-improve categories As discussed in Section 1 , the A-S-I framework is generally used to structure policy measures that aim to reduce emission. It has been widely adopted to address rapidly transforming transport sector in developing countries since 2000. Recently, the A-S-I framework is proposed to apply beyond the transport sector (Creutzig et al., 2022 ; Roy et al., 2021 ; Creutzig et al., 2018 ). In this paper, the interventions identified from each article (see SM2 and SM3) are classified into the three categories of the A-S-I framework (SM2). A total of 92 interventions have been identified: 34 for food waste reduction and 58 for sustainable dietary choices. 10 ‘Avoid’ , 10 ‘Shift’  and 14 ‘Improve’  interventions are identified for food waste reduction at consume end, and 15 ‘Avoid’ , 7 ‘Shift’  and 36 ‘Improve’  interventions are identified for sustainable dietary choice. Table 3   lists the interventions. For food waste reduction, ‘Avoid’  interventions include those that help in reducing food waste or avoiding food waste completely, e.g. need based cooking which satisfies sufficiency criterion (IPCC, 2022 ); ‘Shift’  interventions are those that aid in reusing (e.g. feeding to pets; using doggy bags; donating leftovers to food banks) or recycling food waste (composting) and ‘Improve ’ interventions help to build awareness in consumers which are supposed to alter their behaviour towards food waste (e.g. display of info-graphic posters in dining halls with messages on the benefits of reducing food waste, charging penalty on the amount of food wasted) and/or change lifestyle choices like carrying shopping list, buying fresh food. From the food hierarchy perspective (Papargyropoulou et al., 2014 ), our ‘Avoid’  interventions are similar to the prevention of food waste while ‘Shift’  interventions are similar to re-use and recycle of food waste. Similarly, for sustainable dietary choices, ‘Avoid’  interventions help in avoiding the demand for meat or highly processed food; ‘Shift’  interventions help in shifting the demand for meat to other alternative less-GHG emitting food items (e.g., seafood, insect-based protein, organic food) or shifting the demand for highly processed food products towards less processed food products. On the other hand, ‘Improve’  interventions help in awareness building that might lead to change in consumer behaviour towards less meat diet and less processed food consumption and/or consumers themselves taking incremental steps towards balanced, sustainable healthy diets choices.  3.4 Actors in A-S-I categories Identifying wide diversity of social actors with different values, interests and concerns to tackle climate change are crucial to scaling up these interventions (Green et al., 2018 ). But how to do this is not always clear (Lorenz et al., 2019 ). Therefore, we tried to classify these interventions further by the social actors (‘change agents’ ): institutions (e.g., educational-universities, governing-municipalities, media, and health-care), individuals (e.g., consumers, researchers, practitioners, activists) and supply chain partners (e.g., supermarkets, eateries, advertising agencies). Institutions help in creating awareness, advocating/promoting benefits of food waste reduction and sustainable dietary choices, and taking relevant policy measures. Individuals are groups of non-homogenous actors who can bring about the change by altering their own lifestyle, improving their own self-efficacy, setting examples for others and creating awareness in the society. Supply chain partners can bring in changes in their business processes to alter the behaviour of customers through choice architecture/menu engineering, nudging etc. (see SM5). 3.4.1 Social actors in A-S-I categories for food waste reduction at consumer end ‘Avoid’:  Interventions from supply chain partners like providing access to mobile app-stock list with expiry tracker, smart fridge (Schanes et al., 2018 ) and sensors on food packages that detect spoilage (Conrad et al., 2018 ) help to change consumer behaviour towards avoiding food waste. Though these technological solutions are reported as effective initiatives but have no robust evidence due to lack of quantified studies (Reynolds et al., 2019a ). Also, supply chain partners can improve food packaging by providing all necessary information related to expiry dates, best-before dates (Boulding et al., 2019 ) etc., because lack of such information forces consumers to discard edible food (Benyam et al., 2018 ) leading to more wastage. Individuals' (e.g. the house-cook) initiatives like cooking the amount of food needed depending on the number of guests reduces food waste but this meal planning (von Kameke and Fischer, 2018 ) is very uncommon (Schanes et al., 2018 ). Vásquez et al. (2022)  mention that women plan more than men and therefore produce fewer food waste. Studies report saving money, saving the planet, saving hungry people and preventing guilt are the factors that motivates consumers to reduce food waste (Goodman-Smith et al., 2020 ). ‘Shift’:  Shifting leftovers towards reusing, or recycling leftovers by putting in mixed/garbage bins instead of wasting involves additional actors like institutions (municipalities or local bodies). Also, ensuring environment-friendly treatment of the collected waste, e.g., composting is an important role on the part of these local institutions. Individual practices that helps in reusing leftovers include sharing them with relatives and friends, feeding to pets (Benyam et al., 2018 ) or using donation platforms. Restaurants can play their part by promoting doggy bags and redistributing leftovers at discounted prices (Boulding et al., 2019 ; Filimonau et al., 2019 ). ‘Improve’:  Building awareness in consumers for changing their behaviour towards food waste requires involvement from researchers, practitioners including communication and marketing professionals, activists, policymakers. They can provide various information-based interventions using a range of ‘delivery’ techniques (Reynolds et al., 2019a ) to improve food waste reduction behaviour (for details see SM5). Furthermore, consumers' initiatives like preserving and transforming leftover food by storing in fridge or using microwave (Hoek et al., 2017 ), buying less of perishable foods (Conrad et al., 2018 ) and preparing a shopping list to avoid excess food purchase (Zhang et al., 2018 ) reduces food waste. Overall, based on the literature, for ‘Improve’  interventions policymakers/governing bodies as a social actor have a larger role to play, for ‘Shift’  interventions individual consumers have a greater role to play while for ‘Avoid’  interventions supply chain partners have important roles to play (Fig. 3  ).  3.4.2 Social actors in A-S-I categories for changing dietary choices towards balanced sustainable healthy diet featuring less meat and less processed food ‘Avoid’:  Consumers' own initiatives to avoid meat consumption completely include becoming a vegan, vegetarian or pescatarian (fish eaters). Consumers' cautiousness towards health is the main driver behind avoiding highly processed food (Alsaffar, 2016 ). Strategies of avoiding highly processed food as mentioned in the literature include avoiding snacks, cheese in between meals (van Dooren et al., 2018 ), replacing them with seasonal fruits and vegetables (Żakowska-Biemans et al., 2019 ), substituting soft drinks, non-alcoholic beverages with potable water (Reynolds et al., 2019a ), reducing alcoholic drinks (Yu et al., 2018 ) and buying food from small farmers and local shops (Schanes et al., 2018 ). Initiatives from supply chain partners like canteens and restaurants include broadening the variety of plant-based, insect-based dishes they offer (Orkusz et al., 2020 ; Rust et al., 2020 ), can motivate customers to avoid meat. ‘Shift’:  Shifting towards a less/low meat diet, plant based diet (Lynch et al., 2018 ), various other alternative protein diets like edible insects (Orkusz et al., 2020 ), and sea-based protein diets (Hallström et al., 2019 ) are being promoted globally by actors like policymakers and health practitioners due to their health and environmental benefits. However, the lack of skills on how to cook these meat alternatives is the main barrier in this shift (Kwasny et al., 2022 ; Varela et al., 2022 ). ‘Improve’ : Consumers' behaviour to change to less processed diets is motivated by health consciousness so health practitioners have a great responsibility of advocating greater consumption of fruits and vegetables, avoidance of high energy intake, moderate consumption of beverages (Yu et al., 2018 ). Supply-side actors e.g. manufacturers through their public relations and marketing departments, supermarkets, advertising agencies have a role to play in changing consumer purchase behaviour (Hoek et al., 2017 ) by increasing the accessibility, visibility and availability of meat alternatives-in their shelves (Hoek et al., 2017 ), peer to peer marketing and creating platforms that provides tailored information; promoting discussion with live experts, and cookalongs (Trewern et al., 2022 ). Marshall et al. (2022)  highlighted that describing vegetarian foods using meat related terminology increases consumers' willingness to consume such food. Specifically, food suppliers or retailers can have free tasting stations/vegetarian food fairs for meat substitutes (Ruzgys and Pickering, 2020 ) and can distribute vegan cook books and create mobile apps that provides easy-to-cook vegetarian dishes (Schenk et al., 2018 ). Consumers' own initiatives to reduce meat consumption include several lifestyle choices like becoming a flexitarian i.e. occasional inclusion of red-meat in diet (Armstrong Soule and Sekhon, 2019 ), substituting red-meat with chicken (González-García et al., 2018 ) and observing at-least one meatless day a week. Overall, based on the literature, for ‘shift’  interventions governing bodies and health care systems have a larger role to play as social actors by advocating complete shift towards meat alternatives through dietary guidelines. For ‘improve’  interventions supply chain partners, individual consumers, and researchers, practitioners, activists have a major role to play through nudging, supporting and promoting less meat diets through social media. For ‘Avoid’  interventions individual consumers have important role to play (Fig. 4  ) by changing their lifestyle choices.    4 Discussions 4.1 Food waste reduction at consumer end Food wasted is at least directly related to equivalent waste in energy resources used in its production and indirectly related to energy resources used for fertiliser production, other inputs and in distribution such as energy used in storing and transportation. Not only energy waste, food waste also relates to waste of water that has gone into the production of food. Our results show that reducing food waste reduces energy use/demand (SDG 7), water use/demand (SDG 6) and land use/demand (SDG 15) for food production. Conrad et al. (2018)  reported that 1 pound of food was wasted by average Americans every day from 2007 to 2014 and 30 million acres of cropland were used to produce this food every year. Also, halving food loss and waste can achieve 12% reduction in water (Jalava et al., 2016 ). Figure SPM.6 in IPCC (2022)  shows that the land spared through food demand reduction can be used for reforestation which provides large emission mitigation potential. Awareness campaigns and education programs (SDG 4, 12) are pivotal to motivate consumers in reducing food waste. A study in Portugal found that 70% of the respondents recycle inorganic waste after participating in education campaigns (Pinto et al., 2018 ). However, this option does not reduce food demand/production per se  as this is end-of-the-pipe option. Highest mitigation potential lies in reducing food waste that can eventually show up in reduced demand on land for food production (IPCC, 2022 ). Price instruments like fees, taxes have been found to be less effective in many countries/contexts than well-defined regulations (Schanes et al., 2018 ). Various social actors have a role to play in avoiding food waste. For example, food service providers like canteens in various institutions like educational, office etc., restaurants and hotels can play their part by customising/reducing the portion size, using different sizes of utensils/plates (Lorenz-Walther et al., 2019 ) and charging lower price for smaller portions (Reynolds et al., 2019a ). In scaling up such changes in service provision needs education/awareness programs targeted at canteen managers and staffs, training on choice architecture (Creutzig et al., 2022 ) which further allows customers to make better choices from menu charts. An experiment conducted in a Norwegian hotel reported 19% reduction in food waste due to reduction in plate size (Reynolds et al., 2019a ). Manzocco et al. (2016)  found that 45% of the food wasted are discared as rubbish, 25% are fed to pets, around 25% are used for (home) composting and only 5% are used for donations. Shifting food waste for recycling needs to be supported by appropriate infrastructure for food waste collection (IPCC, 2022 ). For e.g., green bin residential food waste program in Australia (Benyam et al., 2018 ) has proved effective in changing household's food waste behaviour. Sharing or reusing leftovers are being promoted by several collective initiatives like organising food banks (Morone et al., 2019 ) e.g. Saudi Food Bank Initiative, Plan Zheros in England, Food Cloud in Ireland (Secondi et al., 2020 ; Mu'azu et al., 2019 ). Restaurants/eateries play a vital role in promoting the use of doggy bags by making doggy bags a common practice from food service provider side than to waiting for consumer to request for doggy bags because in some cultures asking for doggy bags leads to embarrassment (van Herpen et al., 2021 ). Restaurants can also re-distribute leftovers among staffs (Filimonau et al., 2019 ). The pan-European ‘Too Good To Go (TGTG)’ smartphone app allows customers to purchase discounted restaurant meals at the end of a day thereby minimising the amount of food wasted (Filimonau & Delysia, 2019 ). Interventions that are being tested and promoted to nudge (incrementally alter) consumer behaviour towards food waste are listed in Table 2  and SM5. One such intervention is displaying information posters near eating halls or sending information-e− mails on the benefits of reducing food waste (Young et al., 2017 ). A university canteen-based study in Germany reported that 86% of the respondents who could recall the poster displayed regarding food waste reduction in their canteen had no-leftovers in their plates (Lorenz-Walther et al., 2019 ). Collaborative efforts among social actors are emerging. The Hungarian Food Bank Association in collaboration with TESCO -a retail supermarket-created a website to make consumers aware of food waste and provided tips on how to reduce food waste via e-mails. This had helped in improving food waste knowledge and skills in 265 households all over Hungary (Boulding et al., 2019 ). Charging a high disposal fee of wasted food from high-income households in China also helped reduce food waste (Zhang et al., 2018 ). In Japan, an education program ‘Bento Day’ is celebrated in elementary and junior high schools since 2001 where students need to cook and prepare food at home to bring to school for lunch. This helps in reducing food waste both at home and in school because students understand the hard-work needed to prepare food (Lindgren et al., 2018 ). In the USA, dietary reformulation in schools resulted in a 28% reduction of vegetable waste (Schwartz et al., 2015 ), while emphasizing on topics related to food waste reduction in school curriculum reduces 33% food waste from main dishes in Portugal (Martins et al., 2016 ). In Fig. 5  , we list 21 interventions encompassing 5 specific social actors (consumers, eatery, super markets, schools and governing bodies) who can reduce food waste inside home and outside home (details in SM5). Many interventions are to be managed externally to help reduce waste at consumer end.  4.2 Changing dietary choices towards less meat and less processed food Shift towards plant-based diets which are in line with standard dietary guidelines can decrease global mortality by 6–10% in 2050 compared to a reference scenario (Dhiman, 2018 ). Shift to New Nordic Diet (i.e., increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, reduced consumption of meat and sugared drinks) could save about 6500 Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) per year from cardiovascular disease (Jensen et al., 2015 ). Resource saving (SDGs 6, 7, 8, 12, 15) potentials of the above mitigation option are highlighted in the literature. Goldstein et al. (2017)  reported significant reductions in water consumption (1.30 ± 12.00 km3 ) and land use (22300 ± 190100 km2 ) due to substitution of 10%, 25% and 50% of ground beef with plant-based burger at the national scale in the USA. Less meat and less processed food in diet have synergies with SDGs 2 and 3. Shepon et al. (2018)  reported 2–20 times more nutritionally similar food production per unit of cropland in the USA if plant-based replacements are made for each of the major animal meats (beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs). With current level of knowledge, complete replacement of meat and dairy products from diet for all may not be feasible given the animal based micronutrients (e.g., calcium and vitamin D) required by human body (González-García et al., 2018 ) but by optimising meat consumption following healthy dietary guidelines has positive impact on public health (SDG 3), reduced risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases and cancer due to reduced intake of saturated fat (Jackson et al., 2022 ). Consumers' willingness to avoid meat depends on health reasons, respecting animal welfare (Żakowska-Biemans et al., 2019 ), environmental concern and religion (Malek et al., 2019 ). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in their official website ‘ChooseMyPlate’ has recommended seafood rich in omega-3 and fatty acids at least twice a week as the main protein food (USDA, 2019 ). Supartini et al. (2018)  reported 5 times increase in the desire to buy fish compared to 10 years ago in UK and Singapore. The reasons given are change in dietary pattern of consumers with younger age, cheaper price and health benefits. Eker et al. (2019)  explained that diet change behaviour is mostly influenced by social norms and self-efficacy. From a cross sectional survey across UK, Culliford and Bradbury (2020)  reported four major factors behind sustainable diet choice motives: health, taste, cost, and environmental sustainability. Therefore, consumers' choice of lifestyle (vegan, vegetarian, etc.) is very important. However, studies have also pointed out that if meat consumption is rooted in social and cultural factors then knowledge on adverse health impacts is insufficient to drive the change (Sahakian et al., 2020 ). Recurring awareness and information campaigns regarding the environmental and health impacts of meat consumption involving policymakers and health practitioners can improve consumers' choice towards less meat diet (de Boer and Aiking, 2017 ). Kaljonen et al. (2020)  found that nudging customers persistently has two effects: restaurants get more freedom to develop new tastier meat-free dishes and can get customers accustomed to those new dishes, while customers get more satiating meat-free options. Global movement like ‘Meatless Mondays ’ started in 2003 for encouraging consumers to have meat-free meals once a week (Meatless Mondays, 2019 ) has now spread over 40 countries, and in 20 different languages. New studies are trying to see the effectiveness of online communities on changing consumers behaviour towards less meat diet. Trewern et al. (2022)  found that ‘ask the expert’ videos are effective in UK. It is also suggested that market interventions like food greenhouse gas tax or meat and dairy tax (Röös et al., 2018 ) or increasing price of meat can help in reducing meat consumption. A study, Charlebois et al. (2016)  designed to evaluate the response of consumers to increase in beef prices in Canada revealed that 37.9% reduced or stopped beef consumption altogether due to higher prices. Studies in European countries have found that women are more interested in plant-based diets than men and that men associate meat consumption with masculinity (physical strength and power) (Duarte et al., 2020 ; Peltola et al., 2020 ). Also, women are primarily involved in cooking and shopping, so their roles are very significant (García-González et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is a good opportunity to influence them to become ‘change agents’  for promoting sustainable consumption in the society. Several interventions that support consumer behaviour change can be effectively implemented by practical and managerial actions. In Fig. 6   we provide a list of 37 such interventions encompassing 9 specific social actors (consumers, eatery, supermarkets, schools, governing bodies, health-care systems, marketing agencies, practitioners, media) who can support in changing dietary choices towards low/less meat diet and less processed food (details in SM5) for a low carbon future.   5 Conclusions Implementation of the two broad climate change mitigation options: food waste reduction at consumer end and enhancing choices in favour of balanced, sustainable healthy diet featuring less meat and less processed food needs understanding of interventions that can enable these changes. Systematic evidence search and literature screening using the Scopus database and focused search in Google Scholar helped in accessing a rich body of existing literature albeit the majority of the studies being from developed country contexts. Reviewing this rich body of literature (211 articles from 2015 to 2022), we identified 92 interventions (Table 2 ) that have demonstrated results in implementing these two broad options and also advancing multiple Sustainable Development Goals. Social actors who are instrumental in implementing these interventions are also identified for each of these 92 interventions (Figs. 5 and 6  and SM5). However, these 92 interventions should not be considered as an exhaustive list because there may be more innovative ways to implement them which new research can further explore. It is important to note that these interventions are context specific and their effectiveness will vary based on different milieu. This calls for multidisciplinary research, multilevel interventions and cross sectoral collaboration among stakeholders, specifically practitioners and policymakers. Assessment of SDGs links (Fig. 2 ) clearly show that it is not all win-win outcomes. Overall, synergies of these two broad mitigation options with SDGs outweigh trade-offs. Reducing food waste at consumer end has clear synergies with SDGs 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16 and 17. While for sustainable dietary choices, clear synergies exist with SDGs 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 16 and 17. Major trade-off in reducing food waste is with SDG 3 because avoiding food waste without changing food choices can lead to increased calorie intake. The literature also reports that such trade-off can be addressed by monitoring portion size, and being careful about nutritional need of the consumers groups i.e., through careful health expert consultation and consumer-group specific health developmental attainment. Waste reduction for improving resource-use efficiency is a win-win option if rebound effect in consumption can be avoided with market instruments and non-market strategic information dissemination programmes, infrastructure development for recycling, innovating and upgrading technologies like food sharing apps. Literature flag a major awareness gap. Majority of the eatery managers are not aware of reduced operating cost implications of food waste reduction and redistribution initiatives. Major trade-offs for sustainable dietary choices exist with SDGs 1, 2, 8, 12, 14, 15 because decrease in meat consumption may have negative impact on the economic growth of poorer exporting countries and replacing meat with ocean-based protein may lead to overfishing and unplanned aquaculture. These can be addressed by providing social protection to pastoral communities to compensate for livelihood loss due to reduction in demand for meat. For people with malnutrition, nationally recommended diet plans can be strengthened through institutional mechanism, inclusive management policies, monitoring, and effective planning while producing alternative food (e.g., limiting overfishing). Promoting health benefits of balanced, sustainable healthy diet has extremely important role to play. Role of choice architects in presenting options linked to pricing incentives, nudge mechanisms can also reduce trade-offs. Some structural and knowledge barriers prohibit consumers to take actions like lack of information/skills on how to cook meat alternatives, lack of knowledge on product expiry date labels, inability to buy local food due to distribution issues. These barriers can be reduced by actions from diverse social actors like supply chain partners (e.g., supermarkets, eateries, manufacturers, and agencies involved in marketing) by creating/promoting/organising platforms to provide tailored information on various meat alternatives/recipes, improving food packaging, and by institutions (e.g., governing bodies—municipalities and health-care) who can look into and resolve local food distribution issues. In discussing the results of this paper, the authors would like to acknowledge certain limitations. In this paper, we followed a semi-systematic review method (Roy et al., 2021 ) because we used only one literature database—Scopus, and performed a focused search on Google Scholar with only English language articles included. As mentioned in Roy et al. (2021)  and Sovacool et al. (2018) , conducting a full systematic review is time consuming which only focuses on narrow range of research question and prevents in-depth analysis. From the Scopus search, it is found that studies are conspicuously biased towards developed countries (∼88% - 111 out of 126 articles mentioning single-country names). Future studies could potentially explore country focused search with varying search terms, try to look for non-English language studies to capture diverse national contexts to bring out regional studies. Despite this limitation and the inadvertent bias arising mostly from developed country-based studies, the strength of this paper lies in that this is the first study that tries to look at how the interventions associated with reducing consumer food waste and sustainable dietary choices can be categorised under A-S-I framework, classifying each intervention by social actors responsible to help in implementation or scaling up. Moreover, this paper assesses the links at the SDG level and reports the associated SDG targets (SM4). Future studies can take a deeper look going beyond qualitative SDG link analysis, and quantifying the SDG links which will be helpful in understanding the magnitude of sustainable lifestyle these two mitigation options can provide, and could also focus on specific SDG targets and indicators relevant for local contexts to derive targeted actions/policies. A detailed context specific barrier analysis will be helpful in speeding up actions. Food waste related interventions can also be considered within various circular economy concepts using waste hierarchy which has not been attempted in this paper. This research has answered some questions but has given rise to many other possible questions for future research. Some of these are (1) what infrastructural support is needed for reducing food waste in both upstream (through supply chain partner) and downstream (recycling, reusing at consumer end) in low and middle income countries v/s high income countries; (2) what soft or hard infrastructural, technological and economic supports are needed for changing dietary choices towards balanced, sustainable healthy diets featuring less meat for meat exporting countries v/s importing countries; (3) understanding of socio-cultural, attitudinal, normative and behavioural differences regarding food waste and dietary choices among people classified by income groups and various other social stratification within and across countries; (4) how drivers of behavioural, lifestyle and socio-cultural changes have been theoretically addressed for these two mitigation options, in various disciplinary approaches and what complementary or commonality can be found; (5) assessing the links at the SDG targets and the SDG indicators levels, (6) quantification of rebound effects; (7) how to measure/determine effectiveness of the 92 interventions identified in different context; (8) identifying barriers in implementation of 92 interventions in various contexts; (9) understanding the long-term impacts of these interventions to figure out their durability in changing behaviour as sustained behaviour change is needed to shift towards a sustainable consumption system; (10) understanding the influence of marketing, social media and mass media on behavioural and lifestyle choices of consumers, and exploring the potential of social and behaviour change communication-campaigns in shifting consumer attitude, norms and behaviour; (11) understanding the influence of social media and mass media on supply chain partners (supermarkets, eateries) who play an pivotal role towards enabling and promoting sustainable dietary choices.
