                  In 2015, the United Nations announced the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to safeguard the earth and end poverty as the new global sustainable development agenda. One of these SDGs, Goal #7, is about affordable and clean energy. Despite the importance, there are few tools that guide policy-makers in aligning their domestic policies with these SDGs. The paper addresses this research gap and introduces a numerical decision-support method for identifying the most suitable renewable energy source (RES). RES selection according to SDGs can be a challenge for decision makers. This article presents an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that is based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) term set. The decision criteria are weighed with HFL Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the most appropriate RES alternative is chosen with the HFL COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) technique. The value of the method is demonstrated on a case from Turkey, and a comparative analysis. This approach constitutes a novelty by proposing a numerical model for SDGs that combines AHP and COPRAS in a HFL environment with group decision-making for the first time. The method can help policy-makers in better structuring local energy policies with regard to global efforts in a developing country setting.

In 2015, the United Nations announced the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to safeguard the earth and end poverty as the new global sustainable development agenda. One of these SDGs, Goal #7, is about affordable and clean energy. Despite the importance, there are few tools that guide policy-makers in aligning their domestic policies with these SDGs. The paper addresses this research gap and introduces a numerical decision-support method for identifying the most suitable renewable energy source (RES). RES selection according to SDGs can be a challenge for decision makers. This article presents an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that is based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) term set. The decision criteria are weighed with HFL Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the most appropriate RES alternative is chosen with the HFL COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) technique. The value of the method is demonstrated on a case from Turkey, and a comparative analysis. This approach constitutes a novelty by proposing a numerical model for SDGs that combines AHP and COPRAS in a HFL environment with group decision-making for the first time. The method can help policy-makers in better structuring local energy policies with regard to global efforts in a developing country setting.

This means that the three core elements of sustainability; i.e. economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection shall be harmonized. Governments, together with businesses and the civil society are mobilizing their resources to achieve the global sustainable development agenda by 2030 under the United Nations. Built on the achievements of the previous Millennium Development Goals, countries adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which call for new and stronger action by all countries to reduce poverty while protecting the environment [1 ]. In this new global understanding, countries increasingly assume ownership of the issue and voluntarily set-up national mechanisms for achieving these comprehensive SDGs. These ambitions are intertwined with many challenges, including new jobs, sustainable cities, industries, biodiversity, sustainable consumption and production, and climate change [2 ]. Energy is related to many of these SDGs, such as decent jobs, income, pollution and ecosystems, and is therefore central to many of these challenges and opportunities the world is facing. Countries are unable to power up their development without a dependable supply of energy, while one person out of five globally still does not have access to electricity. Addressing this enormous challenge, SDG #7 seeks “ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” [3 ]. Countries can transform their energy systems towards this goal by increasing their share of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and carefully planning the most appropriate energy sources to bolster their social and economic development [4 ] while also protecting the environment, which are described in detail in the SDGs. As presented in Table 1  , SDG #7 walks Decision Makers (DMs) through a path of hard targets. One of these targets is growing the share of renewables in the global energy mix by 2030 [5 ]. This will eventually require the mobilization of trillions of dollars from domestic and international public and private sources. Despite the need for harmonized action for sustainable energy, countries evidently struggle how to promote RES and which RES to prioritize over others as national circumstances differ from global goals. Interestingly, there is limited SDG research about how exactly national interests, public expectations, technical and economic feasibility, and environmental performance can be accounted for concretely at country level, while moving towards SDGs at the same time. Each national energy strategy will have its own benefits and challenges with regards to SDGs. The literature offers different solutions to these types of problems, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) being one of them for dealing with qualitative and quantitative decision factors. MCDM methods can be successfully deployed in energy planning problems, particularly for solving complex issues that exhibit uncertainty, conflicting goals, multiple interests and differing points of view [6 ]. There are various MCDM techniques available in the literature, which can be combined and adapted to specific needs. One common character of these techniques is that the evaluation criteria and available alternatives for selection are defined at the beginning, and then evaluated one by one by DMs to ultimately find a preference ranking of alternatives. Since MCDM methods are strongly dependent on DMs' opinions and personal values, uncertainty, hesitancy, difficulty to voice numerical assessments, and bias introduced by individual opinions can affect the eventual decision [7 ]. Therefore, MCDM methods shall be selected and combined with care by considering the strengths and weaknesses of individual MCDM techniques, and the concrete decision problem at hand. RES selection can be modeled as an MCDM problem to determine the performance metrics that entail uncertainty [8 ]. Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTS) can be used to gain better insight into hesitant judgments. HFLTS enables DMs to conveniently and accurately share their expertise due to the ease of expressing their views with words instead of numbers, with a multitude of options for voicing their linguistic evaluations and flexibly selecting the best option [9 ]. Lately, hesitant fuzzy sets (HFS) are gaining popularity, such as Liu and Rodriguez [10 ], who presented HFLTS with a fuzzy envelope, and Xu [11 ], who provided a comprehensive and systematic introduction to the hesitant fuzzy theory and discussed advanced methods about hesitant fuzzy preference relations, hesitant fuzzy aggregation methods, hesitant fuzzy measures, hesitant fuzzy MCDM methods and hesitant fuzzy clustering algorithms. The proposed Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic (HFL)-based approach is built upon two techniques; HFL Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and HFL Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) method. The HFL-AHP algorithm is employed for computing the criteria weights and HFL-COPRAS is applied for calculating the eventual ranking of the alternatives. AHP on its own has a simple structure and ability to deal with complex decision problems, making it one of the most preferred MCDM techniques [12 ]. COPRAS on its own is used for ranking and assessing alternatives in terms of importance and benefit ratings. Criterion values are used to maximize the benefit- and to minimize the cost-criteria [13 ]. HFL-COPRAS is a useful combination that enables DMs to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative criteria and requires restricted subjective information as input from DMs. Compared to many other MCDM techniques, it is simpler to use and requires less calculation time. Combining AHP and COPRAS approaches provides the following advantages [14 ,15 ]:• Practicality of AHP thanks to its ability to hierarchically relating criteria to sub-criteria,  • AHP's functionality for incorporating criteria's relative importance values to include the perception and views of different experts,  • AHP's flexibility and ability to thoroughly compare selection criteria,  • COPRAS's ability to maximize the benefit and minimize the cost of alternatives at the same time.    This approach is combined with hesitant fuzzy logic to bring decision problems closer to real life. The integration of AHP and COPRAS with HFL provides a complementary and transparent approach in a simple and understandable way. It differs from fuzzy AHP-COPRAS in its analytical infrastructure about hesitancy, giving DMs a more flexible environment and presents more realistic results. In this decision model, DMs have the opportunity to express their opinions through linguistic expressions and do not need to mentally convert their ideas into numerical values. When examining the degree of relationship between two criteria, for instance, there can be “absolutely high importance” or “low importance”. Expression of “high importance” is expressed by hesitant terms as absolutely, very, essentially, or equally. There are many available options for such linguistic expressions [16 ]. In the literature, MCDM techniques are used in different energy-related subjects in fuzzy environments [17 ]. Examples include Wu et al. [9 ], who evaluated renewable power alternatives in China by means of a fuzzy MCDM model that is based on the cumulative prospect theory. In recent years, RES are also tackled with interval type2 fuzzy sets [18 ], linguistic interval fuzzy preference relations [17 ], and linguistic hesitant fuzzy sets [19 ]. However, the integrated use of HFLTS with a fuzzy envelope and COPRAS method is a missing link in this field. This study is a first in integrating these MCDM techniques in the realm of energy literature to select the best RES for achieving SDGs. Thanks to linguistic term sets, DMs can express their ideas in with words, instead of mere numbers. This gives a distinctive flexibility, as there are many options for such linguistic expressions. This flexibility also includes the suitability of the expressions to the nature of the criteria themselves, which gives HFLTS its particular strength in solving problems more realistically that better reflect DMs' opinions. The article is first of a kind as it combines HFL AHP and HFL COPRAS techniques with Group Decision Making (GDM) for the first time in the literature. It is also novel in terms of linking global level SDGs with national level RES strategies in a developing country setting. Moreover, it proposes a hierarchical criteria structure that is compatible with indicator- and target-based SDG basis. The objective of this paper is to propose a novel SDG-compliant RES selection model using HFL MCDM methods. This study also demonstrates how verbal information can be effectively used with HFLTS when DMs hesitate when voicing their opinions. The article continues with section 2 , which presents a snapshot of the proposed evaluation methodology, followed by section 3 , where the MCDM methods and related literature are summarized. Section 4  illustrates the proposed model's demonstrative application on the RES selection case from Turkey. Then, section 5  gives the managerial implications of the findings. Finally, section 6  provides the conclusions of the study.  2 Proposed RES evaluation methodology The proposed RES decision-support methodology consists of a structured MCDM algorithm integrated with a new SDG-adjusted criteria hierarchy, which are explained next. 2.1 Proposition of a new evaluation methodology The proposed RES selection method applies HFL-AHP for finding the criteria weights and HFL-COPRAS for ranking the RES alternatives. This algorithm can be described with the following stages, the details of which are illustrated in Fig. 1  .i Defining the problem setting : In the 1st phase, the goal of the decision problem, the DMs, available alternatives, and the SDG decision-making criteria are determined. The goal of the method is defined as selecting the best-suited RES strategy (e.g. wind, solar PV, biogas, biomass, hydropower, geothermal, and wave power) towards SDG #7 to achieve sustainable and accessible energy for the world. This selection is based on a range of different sustainability-related factors, rated by sustainability energy experts. This goal puts forward a number of energy-related targets and indicators [1 ]. Examples of these targets include increasing the share of renewable energy, expanding access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, improving energy efficiency, enhancing research on energy technologies, and expanding energy infrastructure. By reviewing the state-of-the-art and consultations with the selected experts from the energy field, these SDG targets are linked and expanded with a hierarchical criteria tree consisting of 20 criteria under 4 main headings, as displayed Table 2  . Considering that some of the targets are not directly related to the selection of RES, they are excluded from the criteria.  ii Calculating criteria weights : Not all SDG decision-making criteria affect the ultimate decision equally. In the 2nd phase, DMs' linguistic paired comparisons are used to compute all main and sub-criteria weights with HFL-AHP in a GDM environment.  iii Ranking the alternatives : In the 3rd phase, linguistic evaluations of DMs are collected for every RES alternative, according to every criteria about how well the alternatives would perform. Based on these data, the alternatives are compared and ranked. RES alternatives for achieving SDG #7 are compared and ranked with HFL-COPRAS, again in a GDM environment. These MCDM techniques are explained in section 3 .     2.2 Proposition of a new evaluation method Developing decision-support methods can help DMs to direct their efforts to those areas that need more attention to help adopt RES strategies [20 ]. The proposed method aims to present a sustainability-focused approach that guides policy-makers in aligning national energy strategies with SDGs. However, SDG #7 embraces energy generation along with energy efficiency, scientific research and infrastructure investments [1 ] as shown in Table 1 , in contrast to the more limited scope of RES selection. Looking closer at these targets and indicators, it can be observed that they are not easily adaptable to the national context. This is a major challenge in translating national efforts into global achievements. Countries develop their own energy strategies, including RES. A single RES is not always a straight answer for a country's energy policy. An integrated approach for RES selection shall be considered [21 ]. Addressing both national sustainable RES priorities, and ensuring their compatibility with the SDG #7, requires a link between targets, indicators and the criteria that they feed into. As SDGs do not present any criteria, this link needs to be constructed first. As national and global agenda will not always fully overlap, additional criteria are added to the proposed approach to ensure coherence. This is accomplished by carefully reviewing the targets and indicators and defining sustainability criteria based on these, and other criteria from the literature. Considering the economic, social, environmental and technical aspects of these targets and indicators, the proposed criteria are categorized under the following main criteria:• Economic aspects (C1 ) aim to fulfill the affordability and increased shared of renewable energy targets of the SDG by providing a market environment in which electricity is within economic reach of households, investment and maintenance costs are low, renewable energy projects are financially profitable and the market has established rules and institutions.  • Environmental aspects (C2 ) aim to address the clean energy target of the SDG by reducing the environmental footprint of energy generation. This aim is pursued by selecting RES on the basis of their emissions in various forms and ecologic impacts.  • Sociopolitical aspects (C3 ) address the target of substantially increased share of RES of the SDG by mainstreaming these technologies. This can be achieved by making RES socially and politically demandable, i.e. by reducing poverty at local scale, creating decent jobs, contributing to communities and complying with national energy strategies.  • Technical aspects (C4 ) relate to the reliable and modern energy service targets of the SDG by aiming mature but innovative energy technologies that reliably, safely and efficiently generate energy with local know-how.    Using the results of a detailed literature review, sustainable energy criteria collected from the literature and SDG targets are integrated with great care, which are then validated by three sustainable energy experts. Their comments are used to finalize the criteria set, as given in Table 2 . These criteria are assumed to be independent from each other, also approved by the experts. This method provides policy-makers with a familiar way of taking decisions about how to reach these global targets and also pursue their own sustainability agenda.   3 Presentation of utilized techniques First, those techniques that are used here are reviewed. Then, the specific steps of these techniques are presented. 3.1 Literature review AHP method, developed by Saaty [12 ], is both strong and simple and can be used to prioritize different factors. Hesitancy is a natural occurrence in decision-making problems. AHP can be employed in conjunction with hesitancy if the decision is to be made in an imprecise and uncertain setting. Many possible values are used in HFL-AHP to describe the hesitancy of the assessment of DMs. An opinion that is represented by more than one possible value is called a hesitant opinion [42 ]. Scientific publications are abundant about AHP, fuzzy AHP or advanced fuzzy AHP. Nonetheless, the use of AHP based on HFLTS in a hesitant fuzzy environment is rare in the literature. For instance, Zhu et al. [42 ] combined AHP with GDM, and Mousavi et al. [43 ] introduced the hesitant fuzzy sets to AHP. In another paper, Oztaysi et al. [44 ] proposed a hesitant fuzzy AHP method that involves linguistic evaluations of experts aggregated by ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator. Yavuz et al. [45 ] suggested a multi-criteria evaluation semantic technique for selecting vehicles consuming different fuels with a hierarchical hesitant fuzzy model, whereas Onar et al. [46 ] presented a computer workstation selection framework that is based on hesitant fuzzy QFD with HFLTS-based AHP and TOPSIS. Kahraman et al. [47 ] dealt with the humanitarian logistics location selection problem by using the hesitant fuzzy AHP method. A paper by Huang and Yang [48 ] used the paired comparisons in AHP by deploying hesitant cloud linguistic term sets. Çolak and Kaya [18 ] prioritized renewable energy alternatives by using AHP with interval type-2 fuzzy sets and hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS methods. Another study by Tüysüz and Şimşek [49 ] presented a HFLTS-based AHP method for analyzing the performance criteria in the cargo industry. Fuzzy AHP with GDM under uncertainty is executed with intuitionistic and hesitant fuzzy sets by Kahraman and Tüysüz [50 ]. An article by Kahraman et al. [51 ] proposed a hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP method for the selection among B2C firms. These papers are summarized in Table 3  . COPRAS method was first introduced by Zavadskas, Kaklauskas and Sarka [13 ]. It is based on the direct and proportional reliance of importance and utility levels of available alternatives. It is usable for both of the maximum and minimum criterion values and can be easily applied to complex criteria and problems involving multiple alternatives. Thanks to these features, COPRAS found its way to various areas in the literature, such as combination with advanced fuzzy techniques, e.g. hesitant fuzzy and interval-valued hesitant fuzzy to a limited extent. Zadeh [52 ] introduced the fuzzy set theory to solve problems without sharp limits and exact qualities. Some publications applied COPRAS together with fuzzy logic, such as fuzzy COPRAS employed by Zavadskas and Antucheviciene [53 ] to investigate the regeneration options of derelict housing in Lithuania, and by Yazdani et al. [54 ] to provide a risk analysis framework. In another paper, a combination of fuzzy COPRAS, TOPSIS and VIKOR techniques is applied by Antucheviciene et al. [55 ] to assess redevelopment options for unused buildings. Turanoglu Bekar et al. [56 ] also used fuzzy COPRAS to develop a new performance measurement method in productive maintenance. The use of COPRAS with the hesitant fuzzy environment, on the other hand, is uncommon. As one of the few publications, Mousavi and Tavakkoli-Moghaddam [16 ] presented a hierarchical COPRAS technique to consider both subjective and objective opinions based on the HFS theory. In another recent paper, Gitinavard et al. [57 ] proposed an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy COPRAS technique which can be deployed for MCDM problems under uncertainty. Peng and Dai [58 ] presented three hesitant fuzzy soft approaches that make use of WASPAS, MABAC, and COPRAS with combined priorities. Büyüközkan et al. [59 ] presented a cloud computing technology selection methodology with interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy COPRAS. This analysis shows the popularity of MCDM methods and indicates that COPRAS based on HFLTS with envelope, which is used in this study, is proposed for the first time in the literature. This review also signifies that there are no best ultimate MCDM methods that are applicable to all selection problems. Different combinations of techniques may provide superior results in different settings. SDG #7 is another such setting, which underlies the motivation behind this article. Despite its high importance, the literature failed so far to sufficiently explore MCDM methods for the sake of SDGs. Those papers that focus on SDGs, such as by Nerini et al. [5 ], Schmidt-Traub et al. [2 ], and Griggs et al. [60 ] hardly propose MCDM-based solutions, showing a clear research gap.  3.2 Group Decision Making Selection of RES is a subjective practice that is open to varying views and judgments, which can be attributed to the subjectivity of human judgments, including experts. DMs can provide different points of view [61 ]. Therefore, taking decisions with only one DM can bring about subjective and skewed results, which can be improved by involving more experts, who agree on a common problem and are motivated to reach a group decision [62 ]. This makes GDM a suitable approach for eliminating the prejudice and subjectivity of individual opinions.  3.3 Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets Many real world problems are solved by consulting specialists, who usually feel more comfortable when expressing their opinions with words, phrases or sentences instead of numbers [63 ]. Linguistic assessments tend to be more flexible, practical and suitable for simulating cognitive processes [64 ]. On the other hand, such verbal expressions can lead to imprecise and unquantifiable judgments. Such judgments can be processed with Zadeh's [52 ] fuzzy set theory to manage uncertain and vague information. However, DMs can still struggle to select the best fitting linguistic expression. HFS, an extended type of the classical fuzzy sets by Torra and Narukawa [65 ], can be useful in such difficult decision-making environments, where DMs hesitate to name an exact score. It defines an element's degree of adhesion with a set of available values between zero and one, as the following [66 ]:Definition 1 X  is defined as a universal set. HFS over X  is a function that renders a subset of [0, 1], shown as:(1) E  =  { < x ,  h E    ( x )  > | x ∈ X    }       Here, h E  (x)  is defined as a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE), which is a set consisting of values between zero and one. Possible degrees of adhesion of the element x  ∈ X  to the set E  are determined. H  is the set of all HFE.  Definition 2 X  is defined as a reference set. HFS over X  is defined as a function h  that returns values within the range of [0, 1]:(2) h : X → { [ 0, 1  ]   }       Hence, HFS is the union of their membership functions.  Definition 3 M  = {μ 1  , μ 2  , …, μ n  }  is defined as a set of membership function with n elements. The HFS that is associated with M , h M  , is described as:(3) h M  : M → { [ 0 ,  1  ]   }      (4) h M  ( x )  = ∪ μ ∈ M   { μ ( x )   }         Definition 4 The lower and upper boundaries of h  are:(5) h −  ( x )  = m i n  h ( x )      (6) h +  ( x )  = m a x  h ( x )        Definition 5 h  is defined as an HFS. The envelope of h, A env(h)  , is the intuitionistic fuzzy set [67 ] of h,  and μ  and v , and is formulated as:(7) A e n v ( h )    = { x ,  μ A  ( x )  ,  ν A  ( x )   }       Here, μ  and v  are defined as:(8) μ A  ( x )  = h −  ( x )      (9) v A  ( x )  = 1 − h +  ( x )         Liu and Rodriguez [10 ] presented an MCDM setting in which DMs voice their evaluations semantically, with words instead of numerical values. The proposed integrated method presents these judgments with a set of HFLTS.Definition 6 S  = {s 0  , …, s g  }  is a set of linguistic terms, and H s  , an HFLTS, is defined as an ordered finite sub-set of the sequential elements of S .  Definition 7 The upper and lower bounds of the HFLTS, H s +  and H s- ,  are described as:(10) H s +   = m a x ( s i   )  = s j  , s i  ∈ H S   a n d  s i  ≤ s j  ∀ i ;     (11) H s −   = m i n ( s i   )  = s j  , s i  ∈ H S   a n d  s i  ≤ s j  ∀ i ;       Definition 8 E GH   is defined as a function that transforms expressions in words into HFLTS, H S  . G H   is an out-of-context grammar that utilizes the linguistic term set in S. S ll   is an expression domain produced by G H  . This relationship can be represented as:(12) E G H   : S l l   → H s         Comparative linguistic expressions can be transformed into HFLTS as the following:(13) E G H   ( s i   )  = { s i  | s i  ∈ S   }      (14) E G H   a t  m o s t  s i    = s j  | s j  ∈ S   a n d  s j  ≤ s i       (15) E G H   l e s s  t h a n  s i    = s j  | s j  ∈ S   a n d  s j  < s i       (16) E G H   a t  l e a s t  s i    = s j  | s j  ∈ S   a n d  s j  ≥ s i       (17) E G H   g r e a t e r  t h a n  s i    = s j  | s j  ∈ S   a n d  s j  > s i       (18) E G H   b e t w e e n  s i   a n d  s j    = s k  | s k  ∈ S   a n d  s i  ≤ s k  ≤ s j       Definition 9 The envelope of the HFLTS, env(H S  ),  is a linguistic interval with the upper bound (maximum) and the lower bound (minimum), as shown below:(19) e n v ( H S   )  = [ H s −   ,  H s +    ]  , H s −   ≤ H s +           3.4 HFL-AHP method Saaty [12 ] developed a very popular method in the decision-making theory, AHP, which is decomposed into the following steps [42 ]:Definition 10 A  = {a 1  , a 2  , …, a n  }  is defined as a set of values to be aggregated. The OWA operator F  is defined as:(20) F ( a 1  , a 2  , … , a n   )  = w b T  = ∑ i = 1  n  w i  b i       Here, w  = (w 1  , w 2  , …, w n  ) T   is a weighing vector, where w i  ∈  [0, 1], ∑ i = 1  n  w i     = 1 and b  is the associated ordered value vector, with b i  ∈   b being the i th   largest value in A.    The following steps of HFL-AHP [46 ] are applied to make an organized decision to generate the priority of available solution alternatives: Step 1.  First, paired comparison matrices are created and the compromise evaluations from the DMs are obtained with HFLTS by employing the linguistic terms listed in Table 4  . Step 2.  Using the OWA operator, the fuzzy envelope for HFLTS is aggregated and constructed [10]. This aggregation gives a trapezoidal fuzzy number (TFN) as a result. Suppose the DMs' judgments range between si  and sj , i.e. s0 ≤ si < sj ≤ sg. Then, A = (α, β, γ, δ), the trapezoidal fuzzy membership function parameters are calculated as:(21) α = min { a L i  , a M i  ,  a M i + 1   ,  … ,  a M j  ,  a R j  }  = a L i      (22) δ = max { a L i  , a M i  ,  a M i + 1   ,  … ,  a M j  ,  a R j  }  = a R i      (23) β = { a M i     i f  i + 1 = j    O W A w 2    ( a M i  , … ,  a M i + j  2     )    i f  i + j   i s  e v e n    O W A w 2     ( a M i  , … ,  a M i + j − 1  2     )    i f  i + j  i s  o d d             (24) γ = { a M i + 1     i f  i + 1 = j    O W A w 1    ( a M j  , a M j − 1   , … ,  a M i + j  2     )    i f  i + j  i s  e v e n    O W A w 1     ( a M j  , a M j − 1   , … ,  a M i + j + 1  2     )    i f  i + j   i s  o d d              The OWA operation needs a weight vector. By using the parameter in the interval of [0, 1], the 1st - and the 2nd -type weights are defined. The 1st -type of weights, W1 = (w 1 1    , w 2 1    , …,  w n 1    ,), are defined as:(25) w 1 1  = α 2  , w 2 1   = α 2  ( 1 − α 2  )  , … , w n 1   = α 2  ( 1 − α 2   )   n − 2        The 2nd -type of weights, W2 = (w 1 2    , w 2 2    , …,  w n 2    ), are defined as:(26) w 1 2  = α 1 n − 1   , w 2 2   = ( 1 − α 1  )  α 1 n − 1   , … , w n 2   = 1 − α 1      where α1  =  g − ( j − i )   g − 1     , α2  =  ( j − i  )  − 1  g − 1     , g  is the number of terms in the evaluation scale, and j  and i  are the ranks of the highest and lowest evaluation values of the interval, respectively. Step 3.  The paired comparison matrix ( C ˜   )    , where c i j    ˜     = (cijl , cijm1 , cijm2 , ciju ), is obtained. It consists of the aggregated fuzzy numbers generated in Step 2 . The reciprocal values are calculated as:(27) c i j    ˜   = ( 1 ciju   ,  1 cijm 2   ,  1 cijm 1   ,  1 cijl   )       Step 4.  It is checked if each paired comparison matrix is sufficiently consistent by de-fuzzifying these matrices [47 ,68 ,69 ]. Considering TFN A = ( l ,  m 1  ,  m 2  ,  u )    , it is transformed into a crisp number with Eq. (28) .(28) μ d  = l + m 1  + m 2  + u  6       The consistency ratio ( C R  )     is then calculated with Eqs. (29) and (30) .(29) C I = λ m a x   − n  n − 1       (30) C R = C I  R I       where C I    refers to consistency index, λ m a x      is the largest eigenvector of the matrix, n is the number of criteria and R I     is the random index. In case the paired comparison matrices are inconsistent, DMs reevaluate these matrices. Step 4.  The fuzzy geometric mean of each row ( r ˜   i   )     of C ˜     is calculated as:(31) r ̃   i  = ( c ̃   i 1   ⊗ c ̃   i 2   … ⊗ c ̃   in    )   1 / n        Step 5.  The fuzzy weight ( w ˜   i CR    )     of each main criterion is computed with ( r ˜   i   )     values as:(32) w ̃   i CR   = r ̃   i  ⊗ ( r ̃   1  ⊗ r ̃   2  … ⊗ r ̃   n   )   − 1        Step 6.  The fuzzy global weights of sub-criteria are computed as:(33) w ̃   ij  G  = w ̃   i CR   ×  w ̃   j CR       where w ˜   ij  G     the global weight of sub-criteria. Step 7.  The TFNs w ˜   ij  G     are de-fuzzified with Eq. (31) , and the de-fuzzified values are normalized with Eq. (35) :(34) w ij  G  =  α + 2 β + 2 γ + δ  6      (35) w ij  N  = w i j  G   ∑ i  ∑ j  w i j  G           Steps 1–5 are repeated for both the main and their sub-criteria. The overall sub-criteria weights are found by executing the Steps 6–7.  3.5 HFL-COPRAS method HFL-COPRAS can help DMs to reduce ranking errors by assigning membership degrees under a set. It determines the rating of alternatives with HFLTS, and is executed with the following steps: Step 1.  Initially, the DMs evaluated the criteria and alternatives with regard to each other by making use of the linguistic scale provided in Table 4 . Step 2.  These semantic expressions are transformed into TFNs with the fuzzy envelope [10 ]. Step 3.  The decision matrices composed of the HFS formed by the DMs are de-fuzzified into crisp numbers with Eq. (34) . Step 4.  The decision matrix is normalized as:(36) x ij  *  = x ij    ∑ i = 1  m  x ij       for   ( j = 1,2 , … , n  )           Step 5.  The weighed normalized decision matrix is determined as:(37) d i j   =  x i j  ∗  · w j       The weighed normalized values are found by multiplying the weight of each evaluation indicator, w j  , with the normalized decision matrix. Step 6.  The sums S i  - and S i   + of the weighed standardized values are found by using the following equations separately for both beneficial and cost criteria:(38) S i +   = ∑ j = 1  k  d i j       (39) S i −   = ∑ j = k + 1  n  d i j        Step 7.  The Q i   values are each alternative's relative importance values, found with Eq. (40) . The highest relative importance value determines the most appropriate alternative:(40) Q i  = S i +   + ∑ i = 1  m  S i −    S i −   ∗  ∑ i = 1  m  1 S i −            Step 8.  The highest relative priority (Q max )  value is identified. Step 9.  For each alternative, the performance index (P i  )  is calculated as:(41) P i  = [ Q i   Q m a x      ]   × 100 %      With this step, the ranking algorithm for SDG-compatible RES selection is completed.   4 Application of the proposed methodology The method introduced previously is demonstrated on a sample application, where selected RES alternatives from Turkey are evaluated and ranked that contribute toward SDG #7. Due its high economic growth in recent years, the increasing energy demand in Turkey is being satisfied by less sustainable carbon-intensive technologies. New cohorts of gas and coal plants are planned to cover the ever-growing energy needs for economic reasons. This makes the country a suitable candidate for exploring alternative RES strategies that align better with SDGs as an example for developing country settings. In line with its commitments to the SDG agenda, Turkey aims to establish a low-cost, technically reliable, socially acceptable and environmentally friendly energy mix. Renewables remain top on the energy agenda and Turkey aims to place SDGs as a strategic target of its national development plan [70 ]. The decision-making structure is displayed in Fig. 2   visually. The introduced algorithm is executed next for identifying the most appropriate RES strategy for Turkey in line with the SDG #7. The proposed method is presented in Fig. 1 . This is accomplished with the following steps. 4.1 Defining the problem setting Given the complexity of SDG #7, decisions for renewable energy can be best carried out by involving multiple DMs, such as energy policy-makers. Such processes are based on individuals who give their opinions to reach a common decision [7 ]. Each DM can have personal motives and affects the decision-making process in a certain way. In GDM, however, there is common interest for DMs in reaching a final decision on selecting the “best” alternative [71 ]. In the literature, the number of DMs in MCDM problems is usually kept limited to ensure simplicity. In complex and detailed decision problems, there are commonly three DMs [6 ,9 ,17 ,72 ,73 ]. At the 1st phase of the application, a decision committee with three industry experts is formed, who first scored the evaluation criteria weights and then evaluated the RES alternatives. The first expert, DM1 , has private sector experience exceeding 13 years and worked in the development of sustainability indicators for different RES projects. DM2  has more than 8 years of experience for the development of RES projects in Turkey. DM3  has 5 years of experience with environmental and social evaluations of RES. All three experts are sufficiently knowledgeable and experienced in the field of RES and sustainability. The DMs support the process of weighing the criteria and rating the RES alternatives for Turkey, which have the highest potential for transforming the energy mix for SDG's 2030 targets. These alternatives are determined as wind (A1 ), solar PV (A2 ), biogas (A3 ), and hydropower (A4 ), which will be compared and ranked in this case study. The criteria set given in Fig. 2  is used for the evaluation.  4.2 Calculating criteria weights At the 2nd phase, the global weights of the main- and sub-criteria are calculated by means of HFL-AHP. The proposed criteria are assumed to be independent from each other and therefore fulfill the requirement of AHP [74–76 ]. Step 1.  Initially, 3 DMs linguistically scored the evaluation criteria with regards to each other. The paired comparisons of the main criteria, filled by these DMs with linguistic expressions, are illustrated in Tables 5–7    . Step 2.  Construct the decision matrix X  by aggregating DMs' judgments ( X ˜   1  , X ˜   2  ,  … ,  X ˜   k  )  ;   X = [ x i j    ]  ,    where x i j   = [ s p i j     ,  s q i j      ]     where [77 ].(42) s p i j     = m i n { min  l = 1   ( m a x H s i j    l   )  ,  max  l = 1   ( m i n H s i j    l   )   }      (43) s q i j     = m a x { min  l = 1   ( m a x H s i j    l   )  ,  max  l = 1   ( m i n H s i j    l   )   }       The aggregated decision matrix is shown in Table 8   and the Steps 1 and 2 are repeated for each sub-criterion. Step 3.  For the main criteria, the OWA operator and Eqs. (21)–(27)  are applied to transform these HFLTSs in Table 8  into TFNs with fuzzy envelope. In order to check their consistency, the CR of four main criteria is computed. As the CR is 0.054, DMs' evaluations are found highly consistent. Geometric means and the weight of each criterion are computed with Eqs. (31) and (32) . Table 9   displays the weights of the main criteria. Weights in trapezoidal form in Table 9  are normalized. These normalized weights are 0.129, 0.311, 0.444 and 0.116, respectively. In accordance with these results, the most appropriate criterion is sociopolitical (C3 ). The second, third and fourth criteria are ranked as environmental (C2 ), economic (C1 ) and technical (C4 ), respectively. Step 4.  Here, Step 3 is repeated for the sub-criteria to obtain relative scores reported in Table 10  . The global scores, as well as the de-fuzzified and normalized weights of the sub-criteria, are found with Eqs. (33)–(35) , as given in Table 10 . The sums of the sub-criteria suggest that C3 , the sociopolitical main criterion, is the most important factor for RES selection contributing to SDG #7. This makes sense, considering that this global goal prioritizes people's affordable access to energy with a special emphasis on social and economic development.  4.3 Ranking the alternatives At this 3rd and final phase, RES alternatives are ranked with HFL-COPRAS. Step 5.  The 3 DMs evaluated the criteria and alternatives with regards to each other by making use of the linguistic scale provided in Table 4 . These three matrices are aggregated by using Eqs. (42) and (43) . Table 11   shows the aggregated decision matrix of the sub-criteria and the alternatives, filled by the DMs. Step 6.  These HFLTSs in Table 11  are transformed to TFNs with fuzzy envelope using the OWA operator and Eqs. (21)–(27) . Step 7.  The decision matrix is de-fuzzified to the crisp numbers with Eq. (34) . It is normalized using Eq. (36) . The weighted normalized decision matrix is constructed with Eq. (37) . Step 8. The values of Q i  , Si + , Si - , P i   are calculated using Eqs. (38)–(41) . Table 12   shows the final results. In accordance with results in Table 12 , the most appropriate alternative is Solar PV (A2 ). The second, third and fourth alternatives are ranked as Biogas (A3 ), Wind (A1 ) and Hydro (A4 ), respectively. The final ranking for the case study is: A2  ≻ A3  ≻ A1  ≻ A4 . In the literature, there are different findings on the RES selection problem. Kahraman and Kaya [41 ] did a similar ranking for Turkey and identified wind as the first, followed by solar PV and biogas, while Büyüközkan and Karabulut [6 ] ranked wind and biogas over natural gas and hydropower. Kaya and Kahraman [78 ] published another article on the same problem, suggesting a ranking of wind, biomass and solar, respectively. In a recent article, Büyüközkan and Güleryüz [74 ] compared these rankings and found that wind usually fares the best among others, followed by solar or biomass sources [78–80 ]. These papers indicate that for Turkey the first three ranks are more or less shared by wind, biomass and solar, while their exact ranking depends on the specific problem setting and the techniques used. The results of this application are therefore generally compatible with the literature, generating comparable results with a faster and simpler algorithm.   5 Managerial implications and discussions In this study, a novel renewable energy selection method is proposed for United Nations' SDG #7 by employing HFL AHP and HFL COPRAS methods in GDM as a new scientific evaluation approach. The reasons of combining AHP and COPRAS methods are AHP's practicality, and flexibility, and COPRAS′ ability to maximize benefits and minimize costs of alternatives at the same time. The use of HFLTS helps to overcome the hesitancy of DMs. The application of the HFL AHP method shows that the most important factors for Turkey are sociopolitical (C3 ), environmental (C2 ), economic (C1 ) and technical (C4 ) criteria, respectively. The results of the HFL COPRAS method show that the most appropriate alternative is Solar PV (A2 ). The other alternatives are ranked as Biogas (A3 ), Wind (A1 ) and Hydro (A4 ), respectively. These results imply that policy-makers can equip the proposed method not only to shape their national energy policies that suit domestic agenda, but also that contribute to SDG #7. 5.1 Comparative validation with fuzzy AHP-COPRAS The strength of these findings are validated to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method and to present its validity and superiority to classical fuzzy logic. This analysis underscores the consistency of the ranking of the alternatives by comparing the results of the proposed method to the results of fuzzy AHP-COPRAS method. Fuzzy AHP-COPRAS is widely used in the MCDM literature. It assumes that the optimal solution should select the best decision alternatives considering the ideal and worst solutions [14 ,15 ]. Table 13   presents the ranking of the alternatives by fuzzy AHP-COPRAS. According to the overall result of HFL AHP-COPRAS, A2  is the most suitable alternative, seconded by A3 , followed by A1  and A4 . For fuzzy AHP-COPRAS, in contrast, A4  is the best alternative, followed by A2 , A1  and A3 . The ranking of alternatives changes in this comparison. This change can be attributed to the hesitancy of DMs in expressing their opinions, which are successfully captured by the use of HFL.   6 Conclusions United Nations unequivocally agreed on a set of global goals to put the world on track for a sustainable future. SDGs basically constitute the light tower for nations to stick to when navigating their own policies and strategies. Goal #7 describes the goals for sustainable energy and defines certain global targets. The question is whether, and how far countries' individual energy policies and national actions will contribute to SDGs. While SDGs constitute the global consensus for sustainable development, the literature does not sufficiently deal with how to actually reach these goals in a concrete way. Harmonizing nations' efforts and providing them with decision-support tools can strengthen the achievement of SDG #7's 2030 targets. This article tackles this problem and presents an MCDM-based method to identify the most appropriate RES for reaching SDG targets in a developing country setting. MCDM techniques can bring considerable advantages to complex problems with conflicting criteria, uncertainty, and vagueness. The selection of RES for achieving SDG #7 is therefore approached as an MCDM problem in a GDM setting, where a group of criteria with 2 levels is used together with HFL-AHP for weighing the criteria and HFL-COPRAS for ranking RES alternatives. The integration of GDM provides value by reducing the subjectivity introduced by personal opinions of individual DMs, while HFL gives the opportunity to collect verbal and hesitant evaluations instead of accurate numbers, which is more similar to actual decision-making in real life. The combined method offers feasible solutions, as it can successfully capture DMs' judgments. The validity and strategic importance of the method are demonstrated on a case application from Turkey, which revealed Solar PV to be the best RES for local circumstances in reaching the SDG targets from a developing country of view. The scientific contributions of this article are as follows:• In terms of MCDM techniques, HFL AHP and HFL COPRAS techniques are recent and novel methods, with very few papers in the literature deploying these methods individually. Using both of these methods together in a GDM setting is a first, which presents a scientific contribution on its own. Its application in the energy field can, therefore, provide a new research perspective.  • While there are many publications that deal with the selection of the best energy strategy for a country, their scope are limited to the national context. The SDG framework, introduced in 2015 by the United Nations, brings a global scope that requires concerted efforts at national level. This paper attempts to link the national setting to the global sustainability context to strengthen efforts with a concrete decision-support tool.  • SDGs only offer targets and indicators, and not criteria for decision-making. This article is a first which proposes a well-defined and compliant set of criteria in SDG.  • The article also demonstrates the application on a case study from a developing country perspective to display how this integrated method can be effectively utilized to solve real problems in the energy realm.    These results suggest that the method is a new way of selecting those RES alternatives that also contribute to SDG. Nevertheless, further research can shed more light about the performance of the proposed method by comparing it to other MCDM combinations for the same problem. This article presents a significant first attempt to connect MCDM-based RES selection literature with SDG #7 achievements for the developing world, which is a novel application area. The proposed method is limited in its thematic coverage, as SDG #7 also includes energy efficiency, energy infrastructure, and R&D activities. Instead, the evaluation criteria are extended to a wider range of sustainability-related parameters. This introduces a certain level of subjectivity, which presents further research opportunities. Since this article focuses on RES only, a wider portfolio of options entailing the generation, reduction, infrastructure, and R&D dimensions of energy can be compared and ranked in the future for better integration with the SDG #7. In this article, the interactions between the proposed evaluation criteria are not considered for simplicity and applicability of the method. One possible perspective for future research can therefore be to focus on the dependence of the criteria and their interactions to account for these relations. This can be explored by applying the Analytic Network Process approach [81 ] with HFL terms, beside other methods. Considering the emergence of SDGs on the global agenda, other MCDM methods can also be combined to handle the same problem in the future.
