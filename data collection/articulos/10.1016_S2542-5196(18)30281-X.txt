The increasing availability of data and improved analytical techniques now enable better understanding of where environmental conditions and human health are tightly linked, and where investing in nature can deliver net benefits for people—especially with respect to the most vulnerable populations in developing countries. These advances bring more opportunities for interventions that can advance multiple SDGs at once. We have harmonised a suite of global datasets to explore the essential nexus of forests, poverty, and human health, an overlap of SDG numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, and 15. Our study combined demographic and health surveys for 297 112 children in 35 developing countries with data describing the local environmental conditions for each child (appendix ).4   This allowed us to estimate the effect forests might have in supporting human health, while controlling for the influence of important socio-economic differences.4   We extended this work to look at how forests affect three childhood health concerns of global significance for the world's poorest people: stunting, anaemia, and diarrhoeal disease. We found that, for the poorest households in these 35 countries, forest cover is associated with reduced prevalence of all three childhood maladies, after controlling for potential confounding variables (eg, education, and rainfall; figure  ). Among children in the two lowest wealth quintiles, those who live in areas with more forest cover were significantly less likely to have these diseases than those living in areas with less forest cover. For children in the two highest wealth quintiles, in contrast, we found no relation between forest cover and any of these health outcomes. We also found that as the amount of upstream forest cover increases, the benefits for the poor increase, particularly for those poor households without access to improved water sources (appendix ). These findings suggest that the poorest populations are least capable of replacing natural capital with technology or infrastructure, and are therefore disproportionately affected by the degradation of natural ecosystems. The particular mechanisms through which forest cover can positively affect health outcomes appear to vary among contexts and diseases,5–7   and gaining a deeper understanding of these causal mechanisms will be critical in making effective environmental or health interventions.2,3   Nonetheless, the positive signal we get from forests in these analyses is notable, given that the combined global effects of diarrhoea, anaemia, and stunting on the world's children are devastating and the world's forests are steadily disappearing. Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of childhood mortality globally, killing more children than malaria, AIDS, and measles combined.8   Iron-deficiency anaemia, the most common form of anaemia, has a role in 20% of maternal deaths.7   Childhood stunting affects over 160 million children worldwide, often limiting physical and cognitive growth for life.8   Investing in ecosystem conservation, restoration, or both, might not only improve childhood health outcomes across much of the developing world where forests are in decline, but also help to weaken the poverty-health trap in which many of the world's poorest people find themselves. The forest–human health connection described here is only one example of the relation among nature, poverty, and human health. Other empirical studies have quantified relations between fisheries decline and nutrient deficiencies,9   between deforestation and malaria,9   and between bushmeat availability and anaemia.10   Given the strong associations among well-functioning ecological systems, poverty, and human health, a critical area of research is understanding how natural resource management and conservation can advance multiple SDGs. Clearly understanding these relations is not an easy task. The database we built took over 3 years to build, clean, and operationalise. The complexity of the nature–human health relationship necessitated deep thinking around our theoretical models to control for factors that confound these relations and reflect the differentiated effects of local versus regional environmental processes. Nonetheless, it must become a routine for governments, aid agencies, and other organisations investing in economic development to use the data now available to minimise trade-offs, and to seek co-benefits among environmental health, human health, and equity outcomes.
