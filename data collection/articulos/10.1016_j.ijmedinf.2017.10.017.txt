                  Introduction
                  In Kenya, abortion is illegal under most circumstances, yet about 48 abortions per 1,000 women occurred in 2012. Given the stigma around abortion, little is known about the availability of safe abortion. Thus, we explored the feasibility and acceptability of using SMS mobile surveys to collect information about women's pregnancy and abortion histories in Kenya.
               
                  Methods
                  We sent a one-time mobile survey to 500 18–24year old women who had opted-in to a 16,000-person mobile survey panel. Women elected to answer questions about pregnancy only (number of pregnancies, number of births, age at first pregnancy) or pregnancy and abortion (ever tried to obtain an abortion and whether medical treatment was sought for any complications). The final question for all survey versions was an open-ended question asking respondents how they felt answering these questions.
               
                  Results
                  356 (71%) responded to the initial survey question and 333 (94%) consented to answer questions about pregnancy. Of these, 233 (70%) agreed to answer questions about just pregnancy and 76 (23%) agreed to answer questions about pregnancy and abortion. Three-quarters of respondents indicated that they had positive or neutral feelings about answering these questions over SMS. Lastly, all data was retrieved within 24h of survey distribution allowing for immediate analysis and dissemination.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Women's willingness to share their pregnancy history suggests mobile surveys are a cost-effective and accessible method for gathering information on abortion in Kenya.

Conclusion Women's willingness to share their pregnancy history suggests mobile surveys are a cost-effective and accessible method for gathering information on abortion in Kenya.   Keywords SMS  Text message  Pregnancy  Abortion  Mobile  Stigma    1 Introduction 1.1 Unsafe abortion in Kenya Reaching the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 of reducing the global maternal mortality ratio by 2030 requires reducing the number of unsafe abortions. Globally, approximately half [1]  of the estimated 56 million induced abortions around the world [2]  are estimated to be unsafe, resulting in between 8 [3]  and 15% [4]  of all maternal deaths worldwide. In Kenya, the estimated abortion ratio is 48 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, or about 464,700 induced abortions in 2012 [5,6] . Kenya’s constitution was revised in 2010 to permit abortion under broader circumstances [7] . Still, most abortions in Kenya (75%) are considered unsafe [6] , meaning they are performed under conditions and/or by personnel that do not meet minimum medical standards [8] . Almost a quarter of women who have had an abortion seek subsequent treatment in health facilities for complications ranging from minor to severe (e.g., hemorrhage or sepsis) [6,9] . While unsafe abortion contributes to a large proportion (18%) of maternal deaths in the Eastern Africa region as a whole [1] , in Kenya the estimate is nearly twice as high: one-third or more of the estimated 5,500 or more yearly maternal deaths [10]  may be attributed to unsafe abortions [11–13] . However, due to stigma and legal/policy restrictions, we lack information on the numbers and causes of unsafe abortion and how they impact SDG 3 in Kenya.  1.2 Mobile as a data collection method Previous studies have shown that abortion stigma limits the willingness of women to report abortion experiences in national surveys or qualitative interviews [8,14,15] . Due to the private nature of mobile communication without an in-person interviewer, mobile data collection has been shown to reduce social desirability bias [16,17] , especially when reporting sexual behaviors [18] . Similarly, survey participants have been found to more accurately report potentially stigmatizing answers when asked electronically than when asked by an interviewer [19–21] . Past studies have addressed the use of mobile technology for follow-up communication after abortion procedures [22,23]  and for the systematic collection of health facility data [24] , but to our knowledge no published studies have evaluated the use of short message service (SMS) text messaging to survey women on their abortion experiences. In hard-to-reach parts of the world, the growth in access to and trust of mobile phones has made mobile messaging a valuable tool for communicating with populations who may be difficult to reach [25–28] . In Kenya, about 82% of people own a mobile phone, and of these, 80% use them for sending SMS messages [29] . We hypothesize that the spread of mobile phones and their usefulness in collecting data on sensitive topics suggests that SMS text messaging could be a novel way to generate better estimates of abortion incidence, to develop a better description of the contribution of unsafe abortion to maternal morbidity, and consequently, to inform policies and programs targeted at reaching SDG 3. In this paper, we present results from the initial phase of an iterative, multi-phase pilot project exploring the feasibility and acceptability of using SMS mobile surveys to collect information on Kenyan women’s pregnancy and abortion histories.   2 Methods 2.1 Study design and study population In May 2016 we sent a one-time mobile SMS survey to a random sample of 500 women in Kenya aged 18–24 years who had previously opted-in to a 16,000-person survey panel through mSurvey, a Nairobi-based mobile data collection company. mSurvey has been using in-person enumerators to continuously recruit a convenience sample across Kenya since 2012. Eligibility for the mSurvey audience network is: 1) ownership of a mobile phone for personal use; 2) English literacy; and 3) ability to send and receive SMS and audience members agree to receive both research and market surveys. Over half of the mSurvey sample (56%) is 18–24 years old, therefore we chose to include only this age group assuming they would be more representative of the general population than older age groups in the sample.  2.2 Study procedures SMS allows for a maximum of 160 characters per survey question, so the consent was separated into three initial questions that briefly described confidentiality, voluntary participation, and compensation. If the participant responded ‘no’ to any of the three initial consent questions, she was advanced to the end of the survey and thanked for her time. To ensure women were comfortable answering sensitive questions, they were able to choose which types of questions they would be willing to answer: pregnancy only or pregnancy and abortion. Women who were willing to answer questions about pregnancy only received survey version A which included questions on number of pregnancies; age at first pregnancy; and number of times the respondent had given birth. To allow for comparisons, those who agreed to answer questions about pregnancy and abortion were randomized through mSurvey’s computer-generated algorithm to receive either survey version B (questions about abortion only) or survey version C (questions about both pregnancy and abortion). Survey B and C’s abortion items asked whether the respondent had ever tried to obtain an abortion; if so, whether she was successful and whether she sought medical treatment for any complications. Survey C additionally asked if the respondent had ever thought  about having abortion. The final question in each survey version asked respondents how they felt answering the questions, allowing for a 160-character open-ended answer. Birth year, county of residence, and gender data were collected by mSurvey during recruitment into the audience network and appended to the study dataset for analysis. In the mSurvey system, participants are pushed an SMS message with a single survey question, and depending on the question format, may respond with numbers, words, or phrases using the mobile phone keyboard. After responding, the next survey question is immediately texted. Participant responses in the mSurvey system are anonymized to protect privacy. The system randomly assigns a unique user ID to each participant which separates their mobile number (MSISDN) from their data, making it nearly impossible to link responses with user identities. Access to data is protected using overlapping security features including encrypted secret passwords. The final message instructs the participant to delete the messages from her phone for privacy. For this study, participants were not charged any money for sending or receiving SMS messages. Upon completion of the survey, participants automatically received 50 Kenyan shillings (Ksh) (approx. $0.50 USD) in phone airtime directly sent to their mobile device as study compensation. At the end of the survey women were also given the contact phone number for a sexual and reproductive health information hotline that they could call with questions. The study was reviewed and given expedited approval by the Emory University Institutional Review Board.  2.3 Analysis We assessed the feasibility of using SMS mobile surveys to better understand abortion history of women in Kenya via response rates and drop-off rates. We also assessed the quality and plausibility of responses. Acceptability was measured by participants’ willingness to provide answers to sensitive questions, by comparing drop-off rates between survey versions A and B/C, and a content analysis of the final open-ended question examining how participants’ feelings about answering the questions varied by survey version and past experiences with abortion. We present here descriptive analyses of the quantitative data and a brief content analysis of the qualitative data. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA version 14.2 [30] . Content analysis of the open-ended data was conducted by two researchers who reviewed and coded participant responses and examined variations in responses using Excel matrices.   3 Results 3.1 Feasibility: willingness to answer questions about abortion via text messaging The survey notification was pushed to 4991  1 The survey notification was initially pushed to 500 audience members but one mobile number was returned as undeliverable.   female mSurvey audience members between the ages of 18 and 24. 356 women (71%) opted in and of those, 94% (n = 333) agreed to answer questions about their pregnancy history. Of these, 70% (n = 233) agreed to answer questions about only pregnancy and received survey version A; 23% (n = 76) agreed to answer questions about pregnancy and abortion and received version B (n = 36) or C (n = 40); 6% (n = 21) said they didn’t want to answer the questions; and 1% (n = 3) did not respond to the third consent question. The final sample size was 309 participants. Overall, fewer than 10% of participants who opted-in to the survey declined participation or did not respond during the consent process (Table 1  ). About half of the sample reported that they were born in 1993 (31%) or 1994 (20%) making them 23 and 22 years old, respectively, at the time of the survey. Slightly more than half resided in Rift Valley (22%), Nairobi (19%), or Nyanza (17%) regions (Table 2  ). This distribution is similar to that of the Kenya general population with a slight over-representation of participants from Nairobi. A large majority (79%) of participants completed the survey within 1 h, with a median total survey time of 13 min, 34 s; all participants completed within 24 h (data not shown). Once participants opted-in to the study and indicated the types of questions with which they felt comfortable, there was very little drop-off. Only 1% (n = 2) of participants did not respond to the first content question in the survey, “Have you ever been pregnant?” and 2% (n = 7) did not answer the final open-ended question. Otherwise, participants answered all questions in the survey (n = 299, 97%).  3.2 Quality and plausibility of responses For two of the age questions, entry errors were common. Of the 158 participants who received the question “How old were you the first time you became pregnant?”, 32 (20%) participants reported an age greater than their current age. An additional 14 participants (9%) reported implausible ages at first pregnancy, such as “1” (nine participants), “2” (three participants), or “3” (two participants). Nine of these 14 participants (3% of the total sample) input either “1”, “2”, or “3” consistently, suggesting that they may be inputting a random number to advance through the survey. Of the 158 participants who received the question, “How many times have you given birth?”, six participants reported giving birth either 16, 20, or 25 times. Possibly participants misunderstood the question and put in their age at first pregnancy as a response to this question. One respondent indicated in the open-ended question that he was a man. Upon cross-checking the respondent enrollment data, we found that at enrollment in the mSurvey panel, the phone number was registered as belonging to a woman, suggesting an entry error at time of enrollment or that the phone number had changed hands.  3.3 Acceptability: reporting abortion experiences and feelings about sharing In this non-representative convenience sample, 58% (n = 178) of respondents reported that they had been pregnant at least once. Of the 34 participants who were willing to answer questions on pregnancy and abortion and had been pregnant, 62% (n = 21) reported ever having tried to have an abortion. Of those who reported ever trying to have an abortion, 81% (n = 17) reported that they had been successful and 29% (n = 5) of these women reported seeking medical treatment after the abortion (Table 3  ). Most questions about pregnancy and abortion took respondents between 20 and 40 s to answer; though there were a few outliers, there did not appear to be any appreciable difference in the length of response time for the more sensitive questions on abortion (data not shown). When asked “How did you feel answering these types of questions?” (Table 4  ), approximately three-quarters of respondents who agreed to answer questions only about pregnancy reported positive or neutral feelings, such as feeling “free,” “relieved,” “normal”,  “okay ”, or “comfortable .” Many women who texted the most detailed responses expressed that sharing their experiences was positive:“Comfortable because I like sharing my experience.” --Woman from Central Kenya with one child  “I feel good because am a proud mummy of one.” --Woman from Rift Valley with one child   While comparatively fewer respondents agreed to answer questions about pregnancy and abortion (survey versions B & C, n = 76), a similar proportion (72%) reported positive or neutral feelings about answering the questions and had similar types of responses compared to survey version A respondents. One woman who received the pregnancy and abortion survey and had thought about, but not had, an abortion wrote, “It ’s good to interact so I felt free to answer them.”  While a larger proportion of women in the survey B & C groups than in the survey A group did report some unfavorable feelings about the survey, few reported extremely negative feelings. In the survey A group, 21 of the 233 participants reported feeling “weird” , “awkward” , or “uncomfortable” ; in survey B & C groups, 15 of the 76 participants reported feelings such as “weird” , “uneasy” , or “a little bit unhappy.”  Between the two versions, there were proportionally more numeric or nonsensical responses in survey A and proportionally more responses that mentioned concurrent positive and negative feelings in surveys B and C. One woman with no pregnancies and no children in the survey A group wrote that she felt “relieved but not so comfortable .” A focus on confidentiality and privacy appeared among some women in all groups of respondents. Five respondents reported feelings of privacy invasion, but only one of these five women received questions on abortion. For example, a woman who received the survey with only questions on pregnancy, but who chose not to answer any of the questions after the first question reported that she felt “Denied privacy .” A number of women reminded us of their expectation that their answers should be kept confidential because of the sensitivity of the topic:“Just normal as long as the information is kept disposed[sic] to the public.” --Woman from Rift Valley with one abortion and one child  “I didn’t mind because I will stay anonymous.” --Woman from Nairobi who has never been pregnant   Women who reported having had a successfully completed abortion appeared to report slightly fewer positive feelings about the survey questions than women who had never tried to have an abortion. Several women referenced their experiences with abortion, such as this woman from Rift Valley who had an abortion and had sought follow-up care for it: “Not that secure, but it is great because I have a lesson to tell. ” Another woman from Rift Valley wrote: “Honest but emotional. I aborted when I was 20.”  Several women also referenced their unsuccessful abortion attempts.   4 Discussion Collecting health information via mobile SMS technology is a relatively new and growing field. Within 24 h, we successfully surveyed 499 women in Kenya and all respondents who agreed to answer questions about abortion completed the entire survey. Coupled with the overall positive feedback and the limited occurrence of highly negative responses (i.e., “resentful” or complaints about privacy invasion), we suggest this method is feasible and acceptable. Women were willing to share sensitive and sometimes culturally-taboo information. The overall high response rate of 71% is consistent with mSurvey’s typical market research opt-in rate, demonstrating that women were as comfortable taking this survey as other mobile surveys. Most survey research on abortion does not directly ask participants if they are willing to answer questions about abortion; abortion items are commonly integrated into more general reproductive health questionnaires and participants progress from less sensitive to more sensitive questions with significant warm-up time. Other techniques such as the List Experiment or sealed envelope methods are also used to increase anonymity [15,31] . In this study, the direct nature of the question “What types of questions are you comfortable answering?” allows women to choose whether they want to answer questions about abortion. Less than a quarter of participants opted in to abortion questions; this low proportion may be a result of abortion stigma as well as self-selection based on abortion history. There are no comparable studies that we are aware of that have asked about participants’ comfort with answering abortion questions; despite the relatively low opt-in rate, we find these results promising as they indicate at least some willingness to answer questions about abortion. Further research should explore whether those who opt-in to answering these questions are more or less likely to have obtained an abortion, or are more or less likely to answer questions about abortion truthfully. Most respondents indicated that they had positive or neutral feelings about answering the questions. Approximately double the proportion of respondents in groups B and C (abortion questions) than in group A (pregnancy questions only) indicated some negative feelings; however, among the few negative responses, most reported modest feelings of discomfort, sadness, or anxiety and only five respondents reported feelings of privacy invasion. The overall positive feedback and the limited occurrence of highly negative responses (i.e., “resentful ” or privacy invasion) indicate acceptability of questions among respondents, suggesting that SMS is a feasible method for collecting pregnancy and abortion data. Furthermore, this study used an existing panel, circumventing the need to hire and train interviewers or recruit participants. Since surveys were sent directly to the phones of participants through a secure database, the likelihood of social desirability bias was reduced and errors in interpretation or data entry by the interviewer or study staff were eliminated. Data was also retrieved within 24 h of survey distribution, allowing for rapid analysis and in turn, rapid dissemination and application of the findings, a process that has been criticized for taking multiple years to translate into action [32] . The speed and efficiency of this innovative method, coupled with the ability to collect information on an understudied area, shows the potential for SMS surveys to more accurately inform the evidence-based policy, advocacy, and programmatic responses necessary to reach SDG 3. We did identify issues that could have implications on data quality. In one case a respondent identified himself as male despite identifying as female at enrollment in the mSurvey panel. Also, nearly one-third of respondents who were asked age-related questions provided implausible answers, mostly an age older than their current age. Both of these could indicate that someone of a different gender or age used this phone number to register for the mSurvey audience network. A person identified at enrollment who is different than the person taking the survey later could have implications for survey screening, consent, and privacy particularly for surveys on sensitive topics. For the age discrepancies, the entries may have been intentionally misleading or due to a misunderstanding of the question content both of which we would have no way of confirming. Either way, these limitations are not unique to mobile surveys but rather digital data collection in general whereby the participant provides their own responses. Further research should explore strategies to limit these types of responses, for example, by changing the response number code options with each question or a quality check to confirm the value entered is plausible. 4.1 Limitations Mobile SMS surveys are not without limitations. We were only able to communicate with younger women (18–24 years old), and thus do not know the feasibility or acceptability of this method among women in older age groups. As the study employed a convenience sample and information about non-respondents is unknown, selection bias is also a potential concern. Furthermore, only 23% of respondents agreed to answer questions about abortion. This low proportion could be due to a combination of question phrasing and self-selection in the consent question series: women may have understood the question about willingness to answer abortion questions as only applying to women who have had abortions. Of those who chose to answer questions about abortion, more than half had experienced an abortion. We did not evaluate whether, when given a choice beforehand, women who choose to answer questions on abortion are more or less likely to have experienced abortion. Despite this unknown, given that women were  willing to answer questions about abortion, we believe that this is a useful and appropriate tool to collect data about abortion experiences. Some limitations are inherent to the use of mobile itself. The 160 character limit of SMS text messages meant questions had to be parsed down, limiting nuance or depth. For example, the term “successful” in the question “Were you successful?”, asked after a woman had responded they had ever attempted an abortion, could be interpreted in several ways. For example: was the respondent successful in accessing abortion services, was she successful in completing an abortion, or does she consider the abortion a successful outcome in her life? Consent also had to be obtained through a series of funneled, somewhat repetitive questions in order to stay within this character limit. This possibly impacted dropout in that it allowed respondents to select themselves out of the abortion survey. Lastly, previous, unpublished research conducted by mSurvey suggests respondents typically lose interest in long SMS surveys, limiting the amount and depth of data that can be collected.  4.2 Recommendations As this method is relatively new and easy to modify, we found several opportunities for improvement. Future surveys could reduce self-selection bias from respondents by not asking participants which types of questions they answer (pregnancy or abortion) and only specifying in the initial consent that the survey will contain questions about reproductive health and abortion, as is common in other surveys where self-selection bias is a concern. However, given that some respondents did comment on their understanding of the confidentiality of the data, researchers should retain and include additional information on participants’ rights regarding privacy and confidentiality in the consent process. Also, answer options should allow respondents to opt-out of questions they are uncomfortable with while still allowing them to progress through the survey. This will increase insight into acceptability by assessing how often abortion questions are answered when respondents do not have prior knowledge of question types.  4.3 Implications for future research As this preliminary, exploratory study is the first of its kind that we know of, there are several areas of focus recommended for future research on mobile abortion data collection methodology. Revision of the consent process, question design, and question order will refine both the overall methodology and the specificity and quality of the data collected.   5 Conclusions Aside from the limits of SMS and mobile technology, using SMS to collect information on abortion should not be seen as any different from using SMS to collect other health data or using conventional survey methods to collect sensitive reproductive health data. In a setting where abortion—and information about it—is highly stigmatized and difficult to access yet where unsafe abortion has a large impact on maternal mortality, there is a particular benefit to mobile data collection’s reduction of social desireability bias and opportunities for fast, widespread, and cost-effective data collection. More accurate and timely information on unsafe abortion and its sequelae in Kenya is imperative for the country to address SDG 3 and unsafe abortion’s contribution to it.

In Kenya, an estimated one-third of yearly maternal deaths may be attributed to unsafe abortions.  2. Abortion stigma limits the willingness of women to report abortion experiences in national surveys or qualitative interviews.  3. Survey participants have been found to more accurately report potentially stigmatizing answers when asked electronically than when asked by an interviewer.  4. In Kenya, about 82% of people own a mobile phone, and of these, 80% use them for sending SMS messages.    What this study has added: 1. Women are willing to share sensitive and sometimes culturally-taboo information about abortion through SMS surveys at a similar response rate to market SMS surveys.  2. Women in Kenya will explicitly agree to answer questions about abortion over SMS.  3. Women report mostly positive or neutral feelings about answering abortion and pregnancy history questions over SMS.  4. SMS survey data can be retrieved within 24 h of survey distribution, allowing for rapid analysis and in turn, rapid dissemination of findings.
