                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 to work towards a sustainable society in which economic prosperity is achieved and social and environmental concerns are met. Under the SDGs, businesses are expected to assume increasingly active roles. However, little is known about the relationship between the preferences of stakeholders and businesses' contributions to the SDGs. This study, therefore, investigates whether the SDGs can function as business norms by examining stakeholder support for sustainable practices. Specifically, the study examines preferences for companies that contribute to the SDGs and the effects of raising awareness regarding the inherent nature of the SDGs on stakeholders' preferences. To this end, we used a nationwide online survey dataset conducted in Japan (n = 6043) and employed a combination of conjoint analysis and an information treatment experiment. The results showed that implementing the SDGs increased stakeholders' preferences for companies. However, a gap existed between the stakeholders' preferred SDGs and the companies' priorities concerning the SDG implementation. The findings suggest that increasing stakeholders' awareness is effective in closing the gap.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 to work towards a sustainable society in which economic prosperity is achieved and social and environmental concerns are met. Under the SDGs, businesses are expected to assume increasingly active roles. However, little is known about the relationship between the preferences of stakeholders and businesses' contributions to the SDGs. This study, therefore, investigates whether the SDGs can function as business norms by examining stakeholder support for sustainable practices. Specifically, the study examines preferences for companies that contribute to the SDGs and the effects of raising awareness regarding the inherent nature of the SDGs on stakeholders' preferences. To this end, we used a nationwide online survey dataset conducted in Japan (n  = 6043) and employed a combination of conjoint analysis and an information treatment experiment. The results showed that implementing the SDGs increased stakeholders' preferences for companies. However, a gap existed between the stakeholders' preferred SDGs and the companies' priorities concerning the SDG implementation. The findings suggest that increasing stakeholders' awareness is effective in closing the gap.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Randomized controlled trial  Conjoint survey  Information treatment experiment  Sustainability    1 Introduction Sustainable development (SD) has been an important social topic since its emergence in the early 1980s. SD aims to “meet the needs and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability to meet those of the future” (The World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 ). However, despite the joint international efforts to achieve a sustainable society, the world faces numerous challenges, including poverty, climate change, and inequality. To tackle these challenges, in September 2015, all United Nations' member states agreed on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a collection of 17 global goals requiring governments, companies, and citizens from both developed and developing nations to work together for a sustainable world by 2030. The SDGs are not legally binding but are viewed as responsibilities that everyone must fulfill (United Nations Development Programme, 2017 ). Under the SDGs, businesses are expected to assume increasingly active roles (GRI and United Nations Global Compact, 2018 ; Scott and McGill, 2018 ) by “apply[ing] their creativity and innovation to solve SD challenges” (United Nations, 2015 ). While investing in these goals will likely economically benefit businesses (Business and Sustainable Development Commission: BSDC, 2017 ), the private sector will have to mobilize considerable resources towards advancing the SDGs (United Nations Secretary-General, 2019 ). The SDGs can play a vital role in encouraging a norm change towards sustainable development (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). However, some authors are concerned that the SDGs might be used for “SDG-washing,” that can be meeting societal expectations without actually contributing towards SD (Buhmann, 2018 ; Ethical Corporation, 2019a ; Kim, 2018 ). Moreover, Vandemoortele (2018)  argues that the SDGs lack the precision and clarity needed to meet sustainability challenges. Despite these critical views, we assume that the SDGs can act as norms to promote sustainability. This approach is supported by the recent developments in introducing the SDGs into the private sector. Five years after the adoption of the SDGs, companies have begun embedding the goals into corporate practice. A global survey targeting senior business practitioners indicated that the number of companies integrating the SDGs into strategy increased from 60% in 2017 to 71% in 2019 (Ethical Corporation, 2019b ). However, as all G20 countries face significant challenges in achieving the SDGs, substantial transformations in various areas (e.g., education, energy systems, land use, urban development) and the long-term involvement of different stakeholders are required (The Bertelsmann Stiftung and Sustainable Development Solutions Network:SDSN, 2018 ). Significant changes in the way businesses think and function are required to meet sustainability challenges (Bocken et al., 2015 ) and reach the SDGs by 2030 (Ohno et al., 2019 ). In addition, the dominant business model, which is focused on short-term economic value, has to be reconsidered (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). The SDGs require businesses to consider “integrating sustainability into the core business and embedding targets across functions” (SDG Compass, 2015 ). As such, SDG-related activities must be profitable and go beyond charity. More importantly, ensuring the creation of economic value may motivate businesses to support the SDGs. Extant studies have highlighted the importance of involving stakeholders in business strategies (Freeman, 1984 ; Freudenreich et al., 2019 ; Hörisch et al., 2014 ; Parmar et al., 2010 ) and sustainable business models by emphasizing multi-stakeholder engagement (Geissdoerfer et al., 2018 ), which has received increasing attention from both research and practice (Lüdeke-Freund and Dembek, 2017 ; Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). Companies need to address the issue of creating value for all stakeholders (Hörisch et al., 2014 ). To achieve this, they need to understand stakeholders' motivation as a prerequisite for sustainability and financial performance (Lee and Raschke, 2020 ) and also promote innovation (Tantalo and Priem, 2016 ). In this context, we argue that businesses can create value when stakeholders support sustainable practices. For example, if a jobseeker prefers a company that contributes to the SDGs and chooses to work for that company, the company can create value from its SDG contribution. This type of value creation through stakeholder support can have a normative effect and lead the SDGs to become a new norm for business practice (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). However, little is known about the relationship between stakeholders' preferences and business contributions to the SDGs. Furthermore, despite theoretical contributions on businesses' actions towards sustainable development, only a few studies which revealed preferences of stakeholders have been conducted. This study, therefore, to fill this gap on existing literature exploring whether investing in the SDGs is beneficial for businesses by examining stakeholders' preferences for SDG contributions (i.e., a company contributes to sustainability under the SDG framework). It also discusses whether the SDGs can function as new business norms for standard corporate practice. To encourage companies' sustainability-related decisions and actions, it is necessary to consider stakeholders' sustainability mindset, create mutual sustainability interest among them, and empower them by integrating education, regulation, and sustainability-based value creation (Hörisch et al., 2014 ). In this study, we look at how sustainability mindsets are created through education, specifically by raising awareness. We also assess whether stakeholders (i.e., consumers, investors, and jobseekers) support companies that contribute to the SDGs and whether increasing stakeholders' awareness on the inherent nature of the SDGs increases their selection of products, stocks, and jobs offered by companies that contribute to the SDGs. We employ an exploratory survey experiment and examine the Japanese stakeholders' stated preferences for businesses based on these businesses' SDG contributions. This study also combines conjoint analysis with an information treatment experiment, in which respondents were randomly assigned to different information treatment groups to measure the impact of SD education on their preferences. Hypothetical scenarios are used to estimate stakeholders' potential support for corporate practice, instead of real-life examples to eliminate factors (e.g., price, product features) that might influence stakeholders' preferences and examine the causal hypotheses on the multiple dimensions of stakeholders' preferences. Therefore, this study provides new quantitative evidence on whether the SDGs can become business norms and influence corporate practice towards pursuing sustainability. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2  reviews the literature on how sustainability concepts emerged in business and the SDGs, discusses the conceptual framework, and develops the hypotheses. Section 3  introduces the methodology, including experiment design and data collection. Section 4  presents the estimation strategy. The results are presented in Section 5 . Section 6  discusses potential implications for both businesses and policymakers and whether the SDGs can function as new norms for corporate practice based on our experimental results. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 7 .  2 Literature review Here, we review the literature on SD and stakeholder engagement and present the steps for the development and implementation of the SDGs, both internationally and in Japan. Furthermore, we review the literature on the effects of information and stakeholders' preferences. Based on these previous studies, we develop a conceptual framework and formulate the research hypotheses. 2.1 The SDG framework More than two years of intensive open consultation with the multiple stakeholders involved in developing the SDGs resulted in an agreement upon 17 goals and 169 targets (United Nations, 2015 ). In the process, Ambassador Macharia Kamau, the co-chair of negations for the SDGs and permanent representative of Kenya to the UN, often encouraged delegates to go beyond “business as usual” in reaching agreements (Dodds et al., 2016 ). SD challenges began conceptually in the so-called Global South and later included environmental issues led by the Global North. Through the SDG creation process, the South contributed significantly to the emergence of international norms (Fukuda-Parr and Muchhala, 2020 ). While all goals are aimed at SD, individual goals and targets may conflict with each other (Barbier and Burgess, 2019 ; International Council for Science, 2017 ; Mainali et al., 2018 ; van Zanten and van Tulder, 2021 ). Meeting the SDGs thus requires a deeper understanding of the trade-off system among the goals (Pradhan, 2019 ). While economic activities are imperative for advancing certain SDGs, companies have to mitigate negative interactions (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2021 ). Rosati and Faria (2019)  summarized recent studies on the SDGs within the corporate sustainability literature, performing investigations on sustainable business models (Morioka et al., 2018 ), multinational enterprises (Donoher, 2017 ; Kolk et al., 2017 ; Schönherr et al., 2017 ; Topple et al., 2017 ), investment opportunities (Schramade, 2017 ), and the marketing and advertising sector (Jones et al., 2018 ). The number of empirical studies on SDG implementation draws data from corporate reports. Silva (2021)  reviewed corporate reports of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 companies and concluded that implementation of the SDGs to transform their business models was limited. García-Sánchez et al. (2020)  studied reports of Spanish companies and found that 84% of those companies did not use the SDGs to manipulate stakeholders' perceptions. A study in 22 Arabic countries identified a regional priority as a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus (Allen et al., 2019 ). A network analysis of the UN coordination on the WEF nexus showed that because of the complexity and potential trade-off among goals, innovative solutions to integrate silos are imperative to reach the SDGs by 2030 (Kapucu and Beaudet, 2020 ). Mobilizing foreign direct investment to African countries had a positive impact on advancing WEF-related SDGs, but a negative impact on climate change (Aust et al., 2020 ). Ike et al. (2019)  investigated the priorities in SDG implementation for Japanese multinational enterprises operating in Southeast Asia and found that host country factors influenced goals that were implemented. Since the SDGs' emergence, scholars have increasingly studied the SDGs' role in business; however, stakeholders' preferences on corporate practice concerning the achievement of the SDGs remain unexplored. To explain this effect, we conducted a nationwide survey in Japan, where there are active upstream initiatives promoting the SDGs, following Caiado et al. (2018) , who suggested that larger survey sample sizes are necessary for improved strategic SDG implementation. While our earlier study (Yamane and Kaneko, 2021 ) provided evidence on the effects of stakeholders' socioeconomic background and briefs on raising awareness, this paper focuses on examining the gap between stakeholders and businesses.  2.2 Sustainable development by businesses Businesses have been involved in sustainability since the SD concept emerged in the early 1980s. The importance of the private sector's role was highlighted in all three major United Nations conferences on SD: Rio de Janeiro in 1992, Johannesburg in 2002, and Rio+20 in 2012 (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). These public international events have also influenced societal expectations regarding corporate practice (Agudelo et al., 2019 ). In alignment with global initiatives, the theoretical development in business research has contributed to incorporating sustainability in business practice. The purpose of the business must be broadened beyond mere profitability, meaning value creation for a broader set of stakeholders is imperative to address sustainability challenges (Busch et al., 2018 ). Current global challenges further require corporations to create shared value (CSV) by maximizing corporate profitability and transcending mere philanthropic activities (Porter and Kramer, 2011 ; Porter and Kramer, 2006 ). For these reasons, the sustainability concept has increasingly been integrated into business modeling. In this study, we define stakeholders' preferences as the preferences for choosing a company as a provider of value (e.g., through products, stocks, and jobs). The conventional business model focuses on shareholders' and consumers' benefits (Bocken et al., 2015 ; Geissdoerfer et al., 2018 ; Velter et al., 2020 ). Stakeholder theory, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of companies developing business strategies while considering their relationships with various stakeholders (Freeman, 1984 ; Hörisch et al., 2014 ; Parmar et al., 2010 ). In this context, we focus on three major stakeholders: consumers, investors, and jobseekers (potential employees). In this study, we use hypothetical stakeholders. Although other stakeholder types might exist (Mitchell et al., 1997 ; Mitchell and Lee, 2019 ), we select these three types based on previous empirical studies to ensure that our findings are comparable with the literature (Alniacik et al., 2011 ; Koc et al., 2015 ; Sen et al., 2006 ). Based on the above conceptualization of sustainable business model, stakeholders, and their preferences, we posit Hypothesis 1:H1 Stakeholders support companies that contribute to the SDGs.     2.3 SDG implementations in Japan In Japan, different actors in the business, local governments, and the education sector started incorporating the SDGs into their activities in line with the central government's initiatives. The government is committed to implementing the SDGs based on five principles: universality, inclusiveness, participatory approach, integrated approach, transparency, and accountability (SDGs Promotion Headquarters (SPH), 2016 ). In the SDGs Action Plan 2018, developed under SPH, businesses are expected to incorporate the SDGs into their strategies and speed up the SDG implementation process (Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, 2019 ). As such, businesses in Japan are especially active in SDG implementation (i.e., Ueno et al., 2017, 2018 ). In 2020, 63.6% of Japanese companies had embedded the SDGs into their corporate strategies(Nikkei Research Inc, 2021 ).1  1 Nikkei, the main Japanese economics newspaper, conducted the second SDGs Management Survey targeting Japanese companies with 100 employees or more during May–July 2020, and 731 companies participated.   Wearing the SDG lapel pin has become a trend among businesses to show their commitment to SDG action and raise awareness (i.e., ANA HD, 2019 ). By contrast, at the individual level, only 6.7% of the surveyed Japanese adults were highly familiar with the SDGs in March 2019. As such, active upstream initiatives for SDG promotion are expected to familiarize the Japanese with the SDGs. Sasaya (2019)  argued that the SDGs would become mainstream in the Japanese business sector, as the concepts underlying them are not new to Japanese firms because a similar merchant philosophy had always existed, which makes it convenient to implement the five principles mentioned above. He also underlined that a deeper understanding of SD is required by businesses for implementation. Company's SDG implementation priorities and stakeholders' preferences may differ. In Japan, Keidanren, the Japan Business Federation, which is a private sector organization with significant influence in setting business agendas, conducted studies on businesses' SDG implementation priorities, and showed that Japanese companies prioritize Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth; Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure; and Goal 13: Climate Action (Keidanren, 2018 ). These findings are similar to those of a global survey conducted by PwC, indicating that Goal 8, Goal 13, and Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production are prioritized by companies from 31 countries (Scott and McGill, 2019 ). By contrast, an awareness survey conducted by Keizai Koho Center (KKC), the Japan Institute for Social and Economic Affairs, on the general public, who are potential corporate stakeholders, showed that priorities differ (KKC, 2019 ). The survey revealed that Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being, and Goal 2: Zero Hunger are priorities for stakeholders. Another study on the Japanese public revealed similar results: Goals 6, 1, and 2 were found to be the most important SDGs (Chapman and Shigetomi, 2018 ). Based on this context background, we put forward Hypothesis 2:H2 A gap exists between the stakeholders' preferred SDGs and companies' priorities concerning the SDG implementation.    To address this gap, not only in Japan but also in general, it is important to involve different stakeholders. For businesses, working with and for stakeholders is essential for achieving sustainable societies and requires active communication with stakeholders to promote a sustainability mindset (Freudenreich et al., 2019 ) and strategically manage multiple stakeholders (Schaltegger et al., 2019 ). Anchoring sustainability in the mindset of all stakeholders is a critical challenge in creating mutual interest among stakeholders (Hörisch et al., 2014 ).  2.4 Effects of information and Stakeholders' preferences Both consumer awareness and sustainability-focused value orientation affect positively on responsible consumer behavior (Buerke et al., 2017 ). If, for example, information on environmental impact and employees' working conditions is provided, consumers may base their purchase decisions on this information (Stöckigt et al., 2018 ). However, since different stakeholder groups likely require different information, the effective means of communicating with target stakeholders should be explored (Du et al., 2010 ). In line with Du et al. (2010) , we argue that raising public awareness is required, as without stakeholder support, companies cannot maximize their value creation through SDG implementation. Education can play a vital role in raising awareness, but its role in creating mutual stakeholder interests is less addressed in the business model literature (Hörisch et al., 2014 ). To fill this research gap, we examine stakeholders' preferences based on companies' SDG practices and investigate the effect of information treatment on different stakeholders by providing information on the inherent nature of the SDGs. We expect that providing different pieces of information to stakeholders will result in different outcome preferences. That is, raising stakeholder awareness may affect their preferences. To test this assumption, we posit the following hypothesis:H3 Providing information on the SDGs affects stakeholders' preferences when selecting a company.    We chose two parameters because they are emerging ideas included in the SDGs and different from previous international goals. The first reflects the necessity for SDG contributions to be profitable for a company. In Japan, individuals may be reluctant to support companies that create economic value through social contributions (Kim, 2018 ). However, as discussed, profiting from SDG implementation is imperative for corporations to continue investing in the SDGs. The second parameter captures the complexity of SDG implementation, as there may exist trade-offs between goals and the actors involved. To account for these two parameters, we test H3 by providing participants with one of the following two pieces of information:1. Businesses are expected to incorporate sustainability into their core business strategy, which requires them to make a profit from SDG contributions; and  2. There are significant gaps in achieving the SDGs between developed countries, such as Japan, and developing countries, such as some African countries.    We expected that providing different information to the public will result in different outcome preferences. This approach makes it possible to find out what aspect of information significantly influences stakeholder preferences. The results will help us understand how information disclosure can be made more effective to raise public awareness and potentially change Japanese attitudes towards the achievement of the SDGs.   3 Materials and methods To test the hypotheses introduced in Section 2 , we designed an exploratory survey experiment. Specifically, we employed the conjoint analysis technique, a fully randomized design developed by Hainmueller et al. (2014)  and embedded an information treatment experiment, in which respondents were randomly exposed to different pieces of information. Several studies have used a similar approach to investigate international climate change agreements (Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer, 2019 ) and waste management (Setiawan et al., 2019 ). We developed our exploratory experiment design based on those studies. 3.1 Experimental survey design To measure stakeholders' support for businesses engaged in SDG implementation, we conducted an online survey on a sample of Japanese adult respondents. The research protocol was approved the Ethics Committee of Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation at Hiroshima University. Fig. 1   shows the survey flows. The survey materials of English translation are provided in Supplementary material (SM). The survey experiment was conducted as following steps. Step 1 : Informed consent was obtained from all respondents. After obtaining informed content, we disclosed three pieces of information before conjoint questions (Steps 2–4). After the information was provided, respondents were given one or two quizzes to confirm their understating of the content. If they answered that they had not understood some information, the same information was shown again. There were no quizzes after the information was shown for the second time. Then, to test the impact of raising awareness on the SDGs for stakeholders' preferences, we included information treatment in our experimental design. Participants were provided with two pieces of information (Steps 3–4). Step 2 : All respondents were exposed to the information regarding the SDGs. We defined the SDGs to familiarize the participants with the concept (see S1 in SM). We selected the information defining the SDGs, considering the respondents with a minimum level of SDG awareness. Step3 : Half of the respondents were exposed to Information treatment 1(T1). Half of the respondents were randomly assigned to T1, which states that businesses are expected to incorporate sustainability in their usual practice, that they must make those activities profitable, and that these actions must extend beyond charitable aid (see S2 in SM). We expected T1 to influence the attributes of the direct economic returns from SDG-related activities. Step 4 : Half of the respondents were exposed to Information treatment 2 (T2). Half of the respondents were randomly assigned to T2, stating that there are significant gaps in the achievement of the SDGs between developed and developing countries (see S3 in SM). The respondents were shown a graph indicating the levels of achievement for each goal, adopted from SDSN (2018) . We expected T2 to influence the attributes of Goals 5 and 13, as Japan lags behind in achieving these goals. Overall, the participants were divided into four treatment groups: 1) control, 2) T1, 3) T2 and 4) T1&T2. Step 5 : All respondents were assigned to one of three stakeholder groups and answered conjoint questions. After these informative statements were given, all respondents were randomly divided into three stakeholder groups and assigned to one of the three conjoint questions: 1) purchasing a product, 2) investing in a company, and 3) seeking a company to work for. We used three different stakeholder scenarios with the same attribute design based on the conceptual framework discussed in Section 2 . First, respondents were instructed to imagine two hypothetical companies with the same profile and offering the same product, stock, or job, but whose contributions to the SDGs are different (see S4 in SM for the scenarios). Respondents were then asked to rank three choices displayed on their screens in order of their preference, imagining that they were actually purchasing a product, investing in a stock, or seeking a job. Participants requested to perform this task six times.2  2 In the beginning of the survey, the first conjoint question for the consumer group was accidentally set as a non-required question. This caused 298 out of 2048 respondents in the consumer group to complete the task only five times.   The experiment included seven sets of attributes: six SDGs and a direct economic return from SDG-related activities (Table 1  ). For the SDGs, we carefully selected six out of the 17 goals, as using all of them would have increased the fatigue effect. The factors discussed in Section 2.3  were considered when selecting the six SDGs. All attributes had two levels: hypothetical companies contributing or not contributing to the SDGs and hypothetical companies profiting or not profiting from SDG-related activities. SDG-related activities' direct economic returns refer only to profits directly attributable to these activities, not to total company profits. To ensure external validity, the order in which the six SDGs' attributes appeared in the first six rows was also randomized for each respondent. Direct economic returns were placed in the last rows and attribute levels were displayed randomly. Step 6 : All respondents answered individual characteristic questions. Step 7 : All respondents answered the SDG awareness questions.  3.2 Data collection and sample Data was collected in March 2019 using Qualtrics, an online survey system. We used a registered panelist pool of Rakuten Insight, Inc., one of the largest research companies in Japan, with a pool of 2.2 million panelists across the country, thus ensuring a representative sample. According to a report by Rakuten, registered panelists tend to use the Internet more than the national census indicator. However, the panelists' basic characteristics, including household and occupations, are not very different from those in the national indicators (Rakuten Insight, 2018 ). We set the targeted sample size to 6000 based on the literature. Japanese panelists aged between 18 and 74 were stratified by 168 groups (five-year age group, gender, and regions, consisting of Hokkaido/Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kinki, Chugoku, and Kyushu/Okinawa) to match the population distribution. An invitation e-mail was sent to approximately 60,000 respondents in the stratified random sample through the provider. Once the target number of fully completed responses was collected for each group, the URL was deactivated and the online data collection stopped for the respective group. Of the entire 8957 participants, 6043 completed the whole survey. Fig. 1  shows the distribution of respondents assigned to each stakeholder and treatment group. The groups consist of approximately 500 respondents each3  3 The sample size varies among groups for two reasons: 1) Randomization was based on the total number of respondents, not the total sample. Some respondents withdrew from the study by not completing the survey; 2) When assigning respondents to information treatment and stakeholder groups, randomization took place three times. We had a total of 12 experimental groups, but we did not divide participants into those groups at the beginning of the survey; they were randomly assigned to each group each time.  . The socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents are presented in Table S.1 of the SM.   4 Estimation strategy To estimate stakeholder support for companies contributing to the SDGs and the effects of raising stakeholder awareness, we used three different estimation strategies. 4.1 Average marginal component effects (AMCEs) To estimate the marginal effect of an SDG contribution on company selection, we estimated the average marginal component effects (AMCEs), as proposed by Hainmueller et al. (2014) . The AMCEs represent the average causal effect of the SDG contribution on the likelihood that a given company is chosen relative to a baseline level, which is shown in Table 1 . The outcome variable is dichotomous, and takes the value of 1 if the preference rank of a company is higher than its alternative company, and 0 otherwise. Using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression with clustered standard errors, the outcome variable was regressed on the dummy variables for all the attributes, excluding the baseline levels.  4.2 Differences in marginal mean To measure the treatment effect of multi-dimensional choices, AMCEs are commonly used because they can be estimated easily without strong modeling assumptions (Bansak et al., 2020 ). However, some researchers raise concerns about utilizing sub-sample group comparisons to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects since AMCEs are sensitive to baseline levels. Therefore, to estimate the effects of information treatment, we measured the marginal means (MMs) proposed by Clayton et al. (2019)  and Leeper et al. (2018) . Following the approach developed by Clayton et al. (2019) , we first calculated MMs, the probability of choosing a company, using the control and treatment groups for each attribute level. The outcome variable is dichotomous, and takes the value of 1 if the preference rank of a company is higher than its alternative company, and 0 otherwise. Next, taking the differences in MMs between those two groups for each attribute level, confidence intervals were calculated using OLS regression with clustered standard errors.  4.3 Probability of overall support Following the estimation strategy adopted by Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer (2019) , we calculated the overall support for a) the most SDG-minded company and b) the least SDG-minded company, as well as the effect of information treatment on the selection of those companies. The definitions of those two companies are presented in Table 1 . Using the logistic regression model, the probabilities of support for the chosen companies were estimated. The outcome variable is dichotomous, and takes the value of 1 if the preference rank of a company is higher than any proposed company, and 0 otherwise.   5 Results Fig. 2   presents the overall support rates of a company with SDG contributions and the effects of information treatment. The estimated AMCEs are presented in Fig. 3  , while Fig. 4   shows the estimated MMs. 5.1 Stakeholder support for a company contributing to the SDGs Fig. 2  shows the support rates of the treatment and stakeholder groups. To measure the effects of information treatment on overall stakeholder support to companies based on their SDG contribution, we estimated the support rates for the most and the least SDG-minded companies (the definition of SDG-minded companies are shown in Table 1 ). The most popular combination of the attributes among the respondents was the most SDG-minded company, which has stakeholder support of 79.2% for purchasing, 76.0% for investing, and 77.7% for job seeking. On the other hand, the least SDG-minded company has stakeholder support of 20.9%, 24.0%, and 22.4% for the three groups, respectively. In the context of investing, stakeholder support is the least favorable of the three in promoting the SDGs. H1, which states that stakeholders support companies that contribute to the SDGs, is thus supported. To measure the overall stakeholder support on each attribute, we estimated the AMCEs by pooling the three stakeholder groups. To see effects without information treatment, the results of the control group is presented. Fig. 3  shows that all estimated coefficients are statistically significant at the 99% confidence interval (see Table S2, for full regression result table). Contributing to any goal has a significant and positive effect on stakeholder support. When companies make profits directly from SDG-related activities, the public's preferences for that company increase by 2.9%. In a nutshell, contributing to any goal and profiting through SDG contributions have a positive effect on stakeholder support. The coefficients for contributing to individual SDGs ranged from 5.1% to 12.0%, indicating that preferences for companies contributing to the SDGs vary depending on the goal. When a company changes from not contributing to Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) and Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), stakeholder support increases by 11.4% and 12%, respectively. However, contributing to Goal 13 (Climate Action)—the top priority of businesses—increases stakeholder support by only 6.9%. Contributing to Goal 5 (Gender Equality)—the most widely implemented SDG among Japanese companies—increases stakeholder support by only 5.1%. H2, which states that a gap exists between the stakeholders' preferred SDGs and companies' priorities, is thus supported.  5.2 Effects of information treatment treatments on Public's preferences Fig. 4  shows the causal effect of the information treatment on attributes. Plots and coefficients in Panels Control, T1, T2, and T1&T2 indicate the marginal means of selecting a profile with a given attribute level. Panels Difference shows the differences in marginal means of control and information treatment groups, with estimates that are significant at the 10% significant level shown in black (otherwise gray). In the T1 group, the differences in the marginal means of the economic return attribute were statistically significant at the 10% confidence levels, indicating that T1 had a positive effect on stakeholder support, as expected based on the research design. In the T2 group, the marginal means of goal attributes are higher than those of the control group. In our research design, we expected that Goal 5 (Gender Equality) and Goal 13 (Climate Action) might be positively affected by T2. However, only Goal 5 had a statistically significant positive effect at the 10% significance level. In T1 & T2 groups, differences in the marginal mean of the Goal 16 (Climate Action) attribute, which we expected to be affected by T2, are statistically significant at the 10% confidence levels, indicating that giving the two pieces of information had a somewhat positive effect on stakeholder support. When one or two pieces of information were provided, stakeholder support for the most SDG-minded company increased, except for the T1 purchasing group. Similarly, when one or two pieces of information were provided, stakeholder support for the less SDG-minded company decreased, except for the T1 purchasing group. The results suggest that awareness about the SDGs influences the public's support for companies contributing to the SDGs. By raising awareness about the SDGs, the public may increase the support of companies with more SDGs contributions. H3, which states that providing information on the SDGs affects stakeholders' preferences for selecting a company, is thus supported.   6 Discussion Here, we highlight two main findings along with practical implications. First, the findings show that SD and creating economic value can co-exist, as companies contributing to the SDGs and profiting from those contributions were supported by stakeholders. Second, we confirmed that stakeholders' preferences and businesses' priorities differ, which may be caused by stakeholders' low sustainability awareness. However, we also show evidence that providing information to stakeholders increases their awareness and minimizes the gap. The first main finding revealed that businesses contributing to the SDGs gain favorable support from the public. For instance, in the purchasing group, 79.2% of the public chose to purchase a product from a company that implemented the SDGs. In addition, the results confirmed that a business contributing to any SDG and profiting directly from this contribution received positive stakeholder support. Furthermore, our results show that stakeholders' support for a company increases by 2.9% if a company creates economic values through its SDG-related activities, even though it is known that Japanese may hesitate to support companies that obtain profits from social causes (Kim, 2018 ). Regarding priorities for SDG implementations, gaps exist between stakeholders and businesses' preferences. The results show that the public prefers companies to contribute to Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) and Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), which is consistent with previous findings (Chapman and Shigetomi, 2018 ; KKC, 2019 ). However, studies have shown that both in Japan (Keidanren, 2018 ) and worldwide (Scott and McGill, 2019 ; Scott and McGill, 2018 ), businesses prioritize Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and Goal 13 (Climate Change). One reason for this gap might be that the public's SDG awareness is low in Japan, whereas strong upstream initiatives have caused businesses to take action and rapidly embed the SDGs into their business strategies (Nikkei Research Inc, 2021 ; SPH, 2016 ). Chapman and Shigetomi (2018)  showed similar results and argued that forming awareness depends on both the issue's visibility and how closely the Japanese public relates to it in their daily lives. Because public awareness of the SDGs affects business practices, businesses are expected to anticipate stakeholders' thoughts and actions (Lee and Raschke, 2020 ) through active communication (Freudenreich et al., 2019 ). It is also necessary to strengthen the sustainability mindset and mutual sustainability interests of stakeholders through education (Hörisch et al., 2014 ). The present study employed the information treatment experiment to test whether and how preferences shift with exposure to information. As discussed in Section 2.3 , we can assume that the Japanese people's understanding of the SDGs was at a preliminary level during the survey. Exposure to the information claiming that companies are expected to mainstream the SDGs into their core businesses positively affected stakeholders' preferences for Goals 5 and 13, which are closely related to business. We suggest that providing information can effectively promote stakeholders' sustainable mindset and may help minimize the gap between stakeholders and businesses. 6.1 Implications for sustainable development The SDGs, being international goals, require stakeholders' support to become norms (Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ). Our study has shown that stakeholders support companies that contribute to the SDGs even when those companies economically benefit from such contributions. At the same time, we confirmed that challenges exist in stakeholder management, echoing the concerns raised by Freudenreich et al. (2019)  and Hörisch et al. (2014) . The public needs to be educated and develop an ability to penetrate the facade sustainability practices of businesses. Otherwise, it may be difficult to prevent SDG-washing—a tactic used to promote a cleaner image (Buhmann, 2018 ; Ethical Corporation, 2019a ; Kim, 2018 ), or manage stakeholders' perceptions by disclosing only self-promoting information or not disclosing irresponsible behavior without actually contributing to the SDGs (García-Sánchez et al., 2020 ). To overcome these challenges, our study revealed that raising awareness on the inherent nature of the SDGs is useful. The information tested in this study was effective in increasing sustainability decision-making of stakeholders. These results demonstrate that businesses may benefit from mainstreaming the SDGs as stakeholders support businesses' SDG contributions. However, for the SDGs to function as a business norm for corporate sustainability, raising stakeholders' awareness is imperative. The evidence from this study will not only help managers develop corporate strategies around the SDGs, but also help public policymakers who promote SDG implementations.  6.2 Limitations and future research directions The limitations of this study can provide directions for future research as follows. The methods employed in this study permit the simultaneous estimation of the causal effects of multiple treatment components and the assessment of several causal hypotheses. However, the experiment used hypothetical situations, not actual contexts; thus, the study does not reflect the relationship between intentions and actual behaviors (i.e., Lange and Dewitte, 2019 ). Although previous studies have shown that gaps between intentions and behavior are large, this study proves that intentions to act among different stakeholders themselves have gaps, implying that actual behavior among stakeholders may have even wider gaps, thus requiring further investigation. Although this study's findings provide clear evidence that stakeholders' reactions vary depending on the situation and information provided, the findings did not discern which background factors influence stakeholders' preferences. In future investigations, it might be useful to broaden the scope of the experiment to other countries. As per the previous discussion, engaging multiple stakeholders is essential for sustainable development. We have provided novel evidence on different stakeholders' preferences; however, we have only tested three stakeholder groups. Future studies should thus focus on expanding the analysis to other stakeholder groups. This study sets the framework for future research on the effective promotion of the SDGs.   7 Conclusions Businesses are expected to play more active roles in promoting SD and the private sector has begun to mainstream the SDGs into its corporate strategy. To further advance the SDGs, creating economic value through business practices and incorporating stakeholders in developing business strategies is important. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on stakeholders' preferences regarding companies contributing to the SDGs. Using a combination of conjoint analysis and the information treatment experiment, we investigated how corporate practice and content awareness affect stakeholders' preferences. Our study suggests that investing in the SDGs is beneficial for businesses, as stakeholders support companies that both contribute to the SDGs and earn profits from those contributions. While our findings are limited because we used hypothetical rather than actual scenarios, they show that the SDGs have the potential to function as new business norms. To realize this potential, public support for companies contributing to the SDGs is necessary, and our study showed that this support would increase even more as SDG awareness increases. This novel insight lends support to companies' active involvement in SDG promotion. Evidence from our study may offer insights to other actors, such as international organizations and governments, who may use information strategy effectively to further raise awareness about the importance of business involvement in the SDGs. Ultimately, policymakers could use this evidence to promote SDG implementation to everyone.
