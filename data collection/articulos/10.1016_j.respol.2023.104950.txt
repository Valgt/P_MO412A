                  We analyse how countries' research priorities align with their greatest Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) challenges and whether misalignments are worse in certain SDGs. Employing a novel method, we identify research related to an SDG by examining research areas in WoS with a higher share of publications containing text related to SDG policy outlets. Then, we use the SDG indicators to create a new score to assess the performance of countries in SDGs in relation to the top performers. Our analysis at the global level reveals a substantial misalignment. Although low and lower-middle income countries tend to face higher SDG challenges, only <10 % of SDG-related research is conducted in these regions. At the SDG-country level, we observe a positive alignment between countries' research priorities and SDG challenges only for SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), and SDG9 (Industry, innovation, and infrastructure). This means that countries with higher SDG challenges are relatively specialised in research related to these specific goals. Conversely, for all other SDGs, our findings indicate a misalignment or an inconclusive relationship between SDG challenges and research prioritisation. A notable misalignment occurs in SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), where the countries with the most unsustainable consumption/production patterns are high income countries that are not specialised in research related to SDG12. Our conclusions, underscore the need for research priorities to be more aligned with national SDG challenges, and advocate for more research funds to be directed towards low and lower-middle income countries.

(2015–2019) by income group. Notes: The y-axis shows the average country score of SDG challenges by income group. A score of 1 indicates a major challenge (country furthest away from the frontier in this SDG), and a score of −1 indicates a country at the frontier. The x-axis shows the global share of SDG-related research by income group. Each colour represents an income group.  Fig. 1 Source: Own calculation based on CWTS WoS version, UN, SDG Index and World Bank data.   Fig. 2 Germany, Argentina, and Tanzania main SDG challenges versus SDG research specialisation. Note 1: A score of 1 indicates a major challenge (country furthest away from the “frontier” in this SDG), and a score of −1 indicates a country at the “frontier” in this SDG (best performer). Research specialisation above 0 indicates that a country is relatively specialised in research related to that SDG, and the opposite for a research specialisation below 0. Note 2: “No SDG” in the research specialisation graphs, refers to the specialisation of countries in research that is not SDG related (e.g. Tanzania shows very low research specialisation in “No SDG”). Note 3: Some of the SDG Scores (challenges) were not computed, since some countries (e.g. India for SDG10) don't have data available for at least one SDG indicator from a given SDG during 2008–2017.  Fig. 2   Fig. 3 Scatter plots of relations between SDG challenges (2008–2017) and SDG research priorities (2015–2019) in SDGs 2, 4, 6 and 13. Notes: The y-axis reveals the research specialisation of authors from a country in a certain SDG. The x-axis shows country scores for certain SDG challenges. A score of 1 indicates a major challenge (country furthest away from the “frontier” in this SDG), and a score of −1 indicates a country at the “frontier” in this SDG (best performer).

We analyse how countries' research priorities align with their greatest Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) challenges and whether misalignments are worse in certain SDGs. Employing a novel method, we identify research related to an SDG by examining research areas in WoS with a higher share of publications containing text related to SDG policy outlets. Then, we use the SDG indicators to create a new score to assess the performance of countries in SDGs in relation to the top performers. Our analysis at the global level reveals a substantial misalignment. Although low and lower-middle income countries tend to face higher SDG challenges, only <10 % of SDG-related research is conducted in these regions. At the SDG-country level, we observe a positive alignment between countries' research priorities and SDG challenges only for SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), and SDG9 (Industry, innovation, and infrastructure). This means that countries with higher SDG challenges are relatively specialised in research related to these specific goals. Conversely, for all other SDGs, our findings indicate a misalignment or an inconclusive relationship between SDG challenges and research prioritisation. A notable misalignment occurs in SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), where the countries with the most unsustainable consumption/production patterns are high income countries that are not specialised in research related to SDG12. Our conclusions, underscore the need for research priorities to be more aligned with national SDG challenges, and advocate for more research funds to be directed towards low and lower-middle income countries.

The platform, data, and thresholds used to understand which research areas are associated with an SDG are available here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ed.noyons/viz/UKStringsSDGtocommunities/Dashboard1 .   1 Introduction There is an increasing demand for science and research funding to be better aligned with societal challenges (Ciarli and Ràfols, 2019 ; Kuhlmann and Rip, 2018 ; Sarewitz and Pielke Jr., 2007 ). This shift has emerged since there is an increasing call for research funders and evaluation systems to prioritise concrete and pressing problems in society at large, alongside “scientific excellence” per se (Hicks et al., 2015 ). However, the capacity of science to meet societal challenges remains poorly understood. Compared with conventional research evaluation approaches that assess research in terms of its “impact” or “excellence” via citation analysis or peer-review for example, the contribution of research to societal challenges is more complex and elusive. Societal challenges, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), can be considered as “wicked problems” (Rittel and Webber, 1973 ) in the sense that there is no single solution to them. The research contributions that might help to solve a certain SDG target depend on the context and may need to combine diverse types of knowledge (e.g. interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary or indigenous). Therefore, directing research priorities towards societal challenges is an exercise of developing research and problem-solving capacity related to certain themes (e.g. SDGs), and influencing the probability of generating solutions related to those themes by promoting interactions in the innovation system with actors that have that knowledge and capabilities related to those societal challenges. Although analysing the research priorities of countries in relation to their SDGs performance is highly challenging, these difficulties need not suppress ambitions or paralyse efforts. Given the urgency of the 2030 Agenda, and since funding resources are scarce and research funders need to make choices about the types of research they support, it is crucial to develop frameworks (as well as tools, datasets and methods) that allow for making informed choices and prioritising some research agendas over others. In this paper, based on the notion that research capabilities are needed to address SDG challenges (see Section 2 ), our core assumption is that a misalignment between a country's research priorities and its SDG challenges may reduce the efficacy of global investments in research to address sustainable development. We operationalise the concept of “alignment” at three different levels: global, country and SDG. first, at the global level we compare the global production of SDG-related research in different country income groups in relation to their SDG challenges; second, at the country level, we compare to what extent the research done by the authors of specific countries is related to their country's major SDG challenges and; third, at the SDG-country level, we analyse if countries that face major SDG challenges produce more research than the average country related to that specific SDG. By analysing (mis) alignments between the global production of research and the societal challenges related to the SDGs targets/indicators, we hope to help national policymakers and international donors in two crucial ways. First, by providing examples of how certain countries are prioritising research areas (creating research capabilities) that are related (or not) to their main SDG challenges. Second, to provide a global understanding of how misalignments between research priorities and SDG challenges might be worse in certain SDGs than in others. By analysing whether countries' research priorities align with their largest SDG challenges, we can provide guidance to help rebalance research priorities towards generating research capabilities to address countries' major challenges. In the next section, we discuss the relevance of this paper, and how it may contribute to the discussion on research funding design and evaluation. Section 3  presents and discusses data and methods. Section 4  presents and discusses the main results, and Section 5  concludes.  2 Background 2.1 Steering research for the SDGs Scientific research is a critical ingredient to developing knowledge-based economies, where knowledge is crucial to contribute to economic growth, social well-being and solutions to address societal challenges. Without scientific capacity, the skills and capabilities available in a country are constrained, and therefore, the ability to absorb, adapt and develop new ideas and technologies is limited (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990 ; Radosevic and Yoruk, 2014 ). However, the development of scientific capacity related to local societal challenges in a country is not sufficient, by itself, to solve those challenges. Research usually becomes significant through complex interactions and feedback loops (Kline and Rosenberg, 1986 ) between many different players, including researchers, firms, local communities, and policymakers (Nelson, 1993 ). In the context of the SDGs, which include goals such as SDG1 (No poverty) or SDG5 (Gender equality), one cannot understand a challenge in a particular country without a profound understanding of its social and institutional context, and the different ways in which they are perceived. Many of the solutions that might help to solve these challenges are social and political, which go beyond scientific and technological advances alone (Kuhlmann and Rip, 2018 ). In this context, SDGs can be considered as “wicked problems” which are societal challenges that are complex, unpredictable, and have poorly defined boundaries. This stands in contrast to “tame problems”, such as engineering challenges, which are more well-defined and solved with technical solutions (Rittel and Webber, 1973 ). Another distinctive aspect of challenges such as the SDGs is that they are broader in nature and require efforts/solutions that benefit from the combination of disparate types of knowledge. Consider, for example, SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production). It includes eleven targets related to sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources, reducing food waste, and environmentally sound management of chemical waste, among others. For each of its targets, one could think of a high number of disparate research trajectories that might contribute to this goal (e.g. research on materials engineering, life cycle assessment, circular economy, global value chains), knowing that some of them will contribute more to specific targets than others, and some will fail. This diversity suggests that public investment in research related to these challenges should keep a diverse portfolio of research strategies available (Jones, 2021 ; Wallace and Rafols, 2015 ), while also developing capabilities to confront novel challenges that are not predictable. At the same time, we know that the main practical benefit of scientific research in a certain country is not the production of easily transmissible information, ideas and discoveries, but rather the construction of a problem-solving capacity, involving the transmission of often tacit knowledge through researchers mobility, training and face-to-face interactions (Pavitt, 1998 ). Similarly, the ability to operate technologies following ready-made manuals and information codified in academic publications may not lead to building capabilities across different parts of the society to innovate and address wicked problems (Bell and Pavitt, 1993 ). Therefore, the benefits of research tend to be geographically localized, meaning each country needs a pool of researchers who belong to international networks and exchange new scientific knowledge (Salter and Martin, 2001 ), who are connected to local research users. Even if knowledge from abroad can be used to solve national SDG challenges, by investing in research related to that SDG, national researchers will be better positioned to explore different trajectories to solve challenges and help translate and adapt that knowledge to the national context. Because the type of research that contributes to meeting an SDG target depends on context and the complex interactions between national researchers and society, and given that relevant research capabilities are needed to develop solutions to address SDG targets, in this paper, we assume that a misalignment between a country's research priorities and its SDG challenges may reduce the effectiveness of investments in research to address those goals (Mitchell Crow, 2023 ; Nature, 2023a, 2023b ). This assumption also builds on the notion that while science may be considered a public good (Jones, 2021 ), the distribution of scientific advances in society and their diverse demands is uneven (Gibbons et al., 1994 ; Nelson, 2011, 2003 ). In other words, although scientific progress expands the knowledge frontier and is deemed beneficial for humanity (Bush, 1945 ), limited attention has been given to how the costs and benefits of these advances are distributed among diverse segments of society and for what purpose (Bozeman and Sarewitz, 2011, 2005 ; Yin et al., 2021 ). For example, comparisons between research priorities and actual research needs in areas like health, agriculture, and other sectors reveal alarming mismatches (Ciarli and Ràfols, 2019 ; Evans et al., 2014 ; Walsh et al., 2020 ; Yegros-Yegros et al., 2020 ). The uneven distribution of research outcomes can be attributed to several factors. First, scientific advance is not the outcome of a linear production process. It is a complex, uncertain and serendipitous process that follows several trajectories, influenced by technical, social and political determinants (Bozeman and Sarewitz, 2005 ; Dosi, 1982 ; Freeman, 1991 ; Johnstone and Stirling, 2015 ), making it challenging to predict who will benefit from scientific discoveries (Yaqub, 2018 ). Second, scientific trajectories are path-dependent and build upon long-term developments (Cowan and Gunby, 1996 ; David, 2000 ). Third, scientific activity is concentrated in a few countries, regions, and organisations that have a stronger influence on their trajectory (Ciarli et al., 2022 ). Fourth, participation in scientific production is biased in favour of the affluent, well-connected, male, and ethnic majorities (Chataway et al., 2004 ; Confraria et al., 2018 ; Ginther et al., 2011 ; Mateos-Garcia and Klinger, 2023 ; Rosenbloom and Ginther, 2017 ; Wallace and Rafols, 2016 ). This bias leads to increasing inequalities in science prioritisation and evaluation processes, for instance through evaluation processes that privilege homogeneity rather than diversity (Franzoni et al., 2022 ), or the underreporting of scientific production that does not find its way in the mainstream journals and languages (Ràfols et al., 2019 ). To address disparities between research priorities and the distribution of scientific outcomes, a better understanding of the alignment between priorities in science (supply) and the priorities in the demand for science in different societies is needed (Sarewitz and Pielke Jr., 2007 ; Woodhouse and Sarewitz, 2007 ). This paper seeks to contribute to this effort by introducing a method for measuring countries' revealed priorities in relation to the first 16 SDGs and analysing how these priorities align with countries' achievements against SDG targets (Sachs et al., 2021 ).  2.2 Identifying research related to the SDGs Previous research on mapping SDG related research has applied different approaches. For example, Nakamura and Pendlebury (2019)  focused only on papers specifically mentioning “sustainable development goal(s)” and their citing papers. Duran-Silva et al. (2019)  used natural processing methods to enrich an initial set of terms per SDG, built by extracting relevant terms from the UN list of goals, targets and indicators. Then, they applied those enriched queries to tag textual records (e.g. publications, projects, etc.). Jayabalasingham et al. (2019)  and Wastl et al. (2020)  applied, instead, a combination of query-based approaches and machine learning methods to identify research related to SDGs in their specific indexing systems (Scopus and Dimensions, respectively). Bautista-Puig et al. (2021)  and Romero Goyeneche et al. (2022) , alternatively, used queries of SDG related terms applied to clusters of publications generated by citation relations in Web of Science (WoS). We also developed a similar approach that allows incorporating relevant SDG related publications that do not explicitly use a specific SDG query term in their abstract/title. It expands the initial sample of publications with SDG related terms by incorporating publications that cite (or are cited by) that initial set. Given the heterogeneity of approaches to map SDG related research, Armitage et al. (2020)  compared two of them (Jayabalasingham et al. (2019)  and the one developed by themselves) and found that country rankings can be very different depending on the approach that is used. Within query-based approaches, they found that the choice of terms, how they are combined, and how the query is structured substantially influences the results and therefore caution should be made when interpreting them. This was expected since SDGs are broad, and the research trajectories that might contribute to each can be disparate. Purnell (2022)  also found substantial differences when using queries produced by four teams (including the one used in this paper). In our approach, we are as comprehensive as possible to identify research related to specific SDGs. We combine text from different types of documents to build our initial queries, and then we improve our queries with relevant terms from the SIRIS approach (Duran-Silva et al., 2019 ) (see Section 3 ). Next, we apply our queries to clusters of publications (research areas) to expand the publications identified with “related” ones, and finally, we perform several methodological robustness checks.   3 Approach Our study builds on two main dimensions of analysis: revealed research priorities and SDG challenges (revealed demands for sustainable development priorities). First, we calculate the revealed research priorities of countries in certain SDGs, by using queries of SDG related terms applied to clusters of publications (research areas) in all WoS. Second, we create an indicator of SDG challenges, by country, using all available indicators to measure SDGs targets. Below we describe in detail how we calculate each of the two indicators. 3.1 Measuring revealed research priorities by country in each SDG We calculate the revealed research priorities of each country by using a comparative specialisation index (Balassa, 1965 ) that allows us to measure whether a country's research is more or less specialised in a certain SDG than the world average (Ciarli and Ràfols, 2019 ; Confraria and Wang, 2020 ). Our approach to identify research related to a specific SDG is based on a two-stage method developed by the authors. The first stage involves building a query with a set of terms (or combinations) strongly associated with a specific SDG. Second, we apply those SDG-related queries to groups of publications (clusters or research areas) generated by citation relations between all WoS publications (Waltman and Van Eck, 2012 ). These research areas (version 2020: 4013 clusters of publications) are built using 2000–2019 publications data; however, given that the SDGs were only established in 2015 (United Nations, 2015 ), the core of our analysis covers data from 2015 to 2019. Since these research areas are obtained from a publication-level clustering algorithm based on direct backwards and forward citations, the advantage of this approach is that these research areas can be seen as research communities that address (or are related to) a specific area/field. In comparison, an approach based on queries identifying only individual publications with a direct reference (query term) to the SDG, excludes the academic community efforts that might have contributed to that piece of research. In practice, our approach allows us to include relevant publications that do not explicitly use SDG query terms in their abstract/title – for instance because they use a different language or focus on an issue that was not explicitly mentioned in SDG policy reports and publications. For example, concerning SDG3 (Good health and well-being), policy documents which refer to some tropical diseases, might not refer to all of them. Our approach allows expanding the initial set of individual publications retrieved by queries (or machine learning approaches) to other publications in the same research area. Since research is cumulative and it is the communities/groups of researchers that can build knowledge to solve challenges (rather than an individual research output), we believe this approach is more adequate for retrieving research related to SDGs. In the first stage, the methodology used to obtain a final list of keywords per SDG consists of a series of steps. In the first step, we select texts from various sources that contain descriptions of specific SDGs. Instead of relying only on official UN sources to identify relevant terms, we search a wide array of policy reports, grey literature, scientific publications, web forums and official UN sources.1  1 SDGs targets and indicators, SDGs website (Progress & Info), UN website, Wikipedia, scientific publications, SDG specific web forums, SDG related reports and policy documents. More detailed information is in Confraria et al. (2023) .   In this way, we aim to capture a broader understanding of SDGs that is shared in different types of publications and authors. We then extract relevant fragments from these texts, which refer to a particular SDG and met a certain criterion.2  2 These fragments must contain text referring specifically to at least one SDG. The text must refer to problems associated with the SDG(s), making a clear connection between the problems and Goal(s) (e.g. using the term “Sustainable Development Goal” in their analysis of the problem). References to “sustainability” alone were not considered sufficient for the document to be included. References to issues associated with the SDGs (e.g. poverty or hunger) but with no explicit mention of the SDGs were also not considered sufficient for the document to be included.   This step allowed us to exclude text content that is not SDG specific and text that is about more than one SDG. Once selected, we partition the text referring to an SDG in different entries, respecting the authors' different ideas. Afterwards, we extract relevant keywords within these pieces of text using a combination of Textrank and Vosviewer algorithms. Finally, we manually select the keywords extracted through these filters and shared these lists with other team members and experts to check for missing or irrelevant terms. The STRINGS queries and a document explaining our procedure in full detail are available in Zenodo (Confraria et al., 2023 ).3  3 https://zenodo.org/records/7823881#.ZD0LzS0RrUI    In the second stage, after validating all 16 SDG queries with experts,4  4 The terms were validated by the research team and several experts, by SDG. In this step we also added conditional terms to limit the identification of false positives when using general terms (Kashnitsky et al., 2022 ). These are a combination of a single term plus terms that contextualise the single term in relation to the SDG or sustainability more in general. We describe the full procedure in Section 2.5 of Confraria et al. (2023) .   we apply those queries to the CWTS WoS dataset,5  5 The CWTS WOS database comprises an enhanced version of Clarivate Analytics' citation indexes: Web-of-Science version of the Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, Arts & Humanities Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index. A combination of smart computer algorithms and manual data cleaning ensures a better unification of universities' and other organisations' names and addresses (see, for example, Elizondo et al. (2022) ). For this study, we included articles, reviews, and conference proceedings.   searching clusters of publications strongly associated with each other by their backward and forward references. We use a classification system generated by Waltman and Van Eck (2012)  at CWTS that separates all WoS into 4013 micro-clusters of publications (edition 2020). This level of granularity is arguably optimal for normalisation (Ruiz-Castillo and Waltman, 2015 ) and to be described by automatic labels (topics); hence the preferred level to be used in our study. Then, we run our 16 SDG queries in all publications of those micro-clusters, which we will refer to as research areas in this paper, to check which of these areas have a high share of publications which include our SDG related text in their abstract or title. We then associate with a certain SDG all publications that belong to research areas with a relatively high share of publications with a certain SDG query term. Given that there can be a variety of understandings of what is SDG related research (see Section 2.2 . and Rafols et al. (2021) ), and different stakeholders might define SDG related research in different ways, we establish two thresholds of “relatively high share of publications” per SDG to accommodate this ambiguity. Both thresholds are determined by the proportion of publications containing SDG terms in their title or abstract relative to all publications within a research area. We define the two thresholds below.1. Strict thresholds: They exclusively identify research areas that the authors consider highly related to the SDG and its targets, based on information contained in the labels6  6 The analysis of the most frequent keywords from relevant clusters in both approaches was crucial to check differences and understand which terms retrieve which clusters.   describing the research area (main topics of the cluster) and on the title and abstract of a sample of the most cited publications in the research area. The determination of the strict thresholds involves sorting areas based on the share of publications associated with a specific SDG. As we scroll down through this sorted list, the moment one of the authors identifies an area as not relevant, we halt the process and set the strict threshold for that SDG accordingly. If disagreement between authors arise, we go for the highest threshold.  2. Loose thresholds: They identify a broader set of research areas related to an SDG. The cut-off for the loose threshold is determined when >50 % of non-relevant areas appear after a certain number of consecutive relevant areas. For instance, if three non-relevant areas follow two relevant ones, we stop at the second relevant area. If four non-relevant areas appear after five relevant, we continue the search if the next area is considered relevant. If disagreement between authors arises, we go for the lowest threshold.    In essence, the strict thresholds reflect a stringent criterion that captures only the most directly relevant research areas for an SDG. The loose thresholds allow for a more inclusive classification of research areas related to the SDG, accommodating a higher degree of flexibility in determining relevance. After this first initial analysis of what research areas are associated with what SDGs, we compare our results with the results obtained using the publicly available queries from the SIRIS approach.7  7 We chose to compare our queries with SIRIS queries because they were among the most elaborated of the publicly available queries at the time of the analysis, and they used machine learning methods to expand their initial set of SDG-related terms with other semantically close terms (rather than using publication clusters). This worked well as a complement to our approach. SIRIS queries and approach can be found in Duran-Silva et al. (2019) .   By checking the differences between selected research areas using the two approaches,8  8 A more detailed explanation of the process can be found in Section 3 of Confraria et al. (2023) .   this comparison allowed us to improve recall and precision.• Recall (type II error, false negative), namely when SIRIS query selects research areas associated with a certain SDG which is not included using our query (first stage).  • Precision (type I error, false positives), namely when SIRIS query did not select research areas associated with a certain SDG which is selected using our query (first stage), but which is not relevant.    After comparing our results using the two queries and changing some of our terms to improve recall and precision, we recalculate the loose and strict thresholds and use the final set of research areas per SDG for our country analysis. While using the loose threshold, approximately 50 % of all research in WoS is related to at least one SDG during 2015–2019.9  9 The remaining research can be seen as not directly related to the SDGs' targets, indicators and objectives. Some WoS Categories we found that have particularly low levels of SDG related research include Astronomy & Astrophysics, Nuclear Physics, Poetry and Mathematics.   Notably, SDG3 (Good health and well-being) dominates, constituting approximately 33 % of all research. Conversely, SDG1 (No poverty) has the smallest share, accounting for just about 1 % of the research. Please see Fig. A.1 ., in the appendix, for differences between loose and strict thresholds by SDG. In the analysis of this paper, we only use our loose thresholds to offer a more comprehensive understanding of SDG related research.10  10 As an example of the different coverage between thresholds, if we apply the strict threshold to SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation) we identify research areas mostly related to “life and earth sciences” (e.g. water footprint, sanitation, submarine groundwater discharge) and “physical sciences and engineering” (e.g. water distribution network, nanofiltration membrane, biosorption). If we apply the loose threshold, we identify all “strict” research areas plus other ones that also relate to “social science and humanities” (e.g. ecological footprint, disaster risk reduction) and “biomedical and health sciences” (e.g. norovirus, legionella).   We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess whether using loose or strict thresholds substantially influences countries' research specialisation across SDGs (see details below). The high pairwise correlation obtained (0.86) indicates that, for our broad country analysis, choosing one threshold over the other does not yield significantly different outcomes. The platform, data, and thresholds used to understand which research areas are associated with an SDG are openly available,11  11 https://public.tableau.com/profile/ed.noyons#!/vizhome/UKStringsSDGtocommunities/Dashboard1    and discussed in Rafols et al. (2021) . The metrics for comparisons between countries are created based on address criteria (the organisation of the authors), using the fractional-counting method (each author affiliation country in a publication is weighted by a fraction of 1).12  12 With four different countries in a publication's author affiliations, each of them is counted as 0.25.   We are aware that (co-)authorship is an imperfect measure of research capacity. Particularly in low-income countries (LICs), the involvement of researchers is often associated just with data collection and contextualisation of results (Boshoff, 2009 ; Morton et al., 2022 ), and meaningful capacity strengthening is most effectively delivered in an environment where there is equal contribution to the development of research questions and study design from all collaboration partners. However, this was the best indicator available for our global country comparison. We only consider countries with >500 publications in 2015–2019 (125 countries) because the relative specialisation across SDGs for countries with smaller number of publications is highly fluctuating. Revealed research priorities of countries by SDG are calculated using a comparative specialisation index (Balassa, 1965 ) that allows calculating if a country's research output is more or less specialised in a certain SDG than the world average (Ciarli and Ràfols, 2019 ; Confraria and Wang, 2020 ). The scientific research specialisation (SI_Pub ) can be expressed as follows:(1) SI _ Pub cs  = P cs  / ∑ s  P cs   P s  / ∑ s  P s       where P is the number of publications in country c   in SDG s  . This index can be interpreted as a specialisation index. If country c   has a higher relative publication specialisation in SDG s  , it means that country c   has more scientific research focused on SDG s   than the world average (SI_Pub  > 1). The calculation of this index (1) implies that the values are necessarily null or positive but are not bound by an upper limit. For this reason, later we normalise the specialisation level between −1 and 1, where 1 = high specialisation; 0 = world average; and − 1 = low specialisation.(2) RCA cs  = SI _ Pub cs  − 1   SI _ Pub cs  + 1         3.2 Measuring SDG challenges by country To analyse the performance (challenges) of countries in different SDGs, we build a score per SDG that combines data from two different sources: i) UN SDG database13  13 https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/database   ; ii) SDG Index.14  14 https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/    We checked which indicators have fewer missing values for all countries and years of interest, and built a unique dataset with 80 different indicators (see Table A.1  in the appendix for descriptive statistics).15  15 In July 2017, the United Nations established 169 targets for the 17 SDGs. Each goal typically has 8–12 targets, with 1–4 indicators per target. However, many countries lack data for multiple SDG indicators, and some SDGs have more indicators than others. In our analysis, for a country to have an SDG score, it must have data for at least one data point between 2008 and 2017 for all associated indicators. SDG3 has the most indicators (11), while SDG13 has only 2. SDG13 has the most country scores (125), while SDG14 has the least (71).   After compiling this dataset of indicators per SDG, we run a principal component analysis per SDG to obtain a single score by country/SDG for which data is available. We follow the next steps: First, for the selected indicators, we calculate the logarithm of those that are not percentages or indexes (e.g. per capita); then, we do a linear transformation by converting each indicator/country to a score between 1 (Best) and 0 (Worst):(3) n cti  = Worst ti  − x cti   Worst ti  − Best ti     c  country  , t  period  , i  indicator      We reverse some variables for consistency, forcing higher values to represent better results. After calculating 80 variables (between 0 and 1) for each country, we calculate the relative distance (d cti  = p 95 ti  − n cti  )   of each indicator/country to the frontier of that indicator (top5% - percentile 95), and we change all values below zero to zero.16  16 We define the 95th percentile as the frontier for all indicators to avoid outliers, and better reflect the variability and disparities in performance across countries.   After this transformation, higher values represent worst results with respect to the SDG targets (higher challenges relative to countries at the frontier). Then, we calculate z-scores for each relative distance to the frontier (top5%).(4) z cti  = d cti  − μ  σ  μ  average  , σ  std . deviation       Finally, we compute a principal component analysis (PCA) (Jackson, 1991 ) for each SDG with more than one indicator available, and we force the PCA to estimate only one component per SDG (eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be provided upon request). We predict the scores of all SDGs for all countries, and we normalise the results between −1 (High performance - ‘frontier’) and 1 (1 = Low performance). Countries with a high SDG score are those furthest away from the “frontier” in that specific SDG, meaning that those countries face a higher SDG challenge (or gap) in achieving that goal. Countries with a low score are those at the “frontier” in that specific SDG. Since SDG scores are not size dependent, we can directly compare them to the revealed SDG research priorities.  3.3 Analytical approach Our investigation is done at three levels: global, country and SDG. One of the main contributions of our study is precisely related to the development of analytical methods at different levels, which allows understanding empirically the concept of “alignment” of countries' research priorities versus societal challenges (SDGs). We start by comparing the proportion (global share) of SDG-related research produced by four income country groups (as classified by the World Bank) with the level of SDG challenges they face on average. Our objective here is to have a general overview between SDG research priorities and SDG challenges across the world and to provide evidence on whether, in absolute terms, countries that face higher SDG challenges are building the capabilities through scientific research that may be used to address those challenges. Second, we graphically compare the SDG research priorities measure of specific countries (and country groups) in relation to their major SDG challenges measures. Answering this question provides descriptive examples of how governments may assess and rebalance research priorities towards topics closer to countries' major challenges. Third, to study whether SDG challenges in earlier years influence countries' research agenda in later years (Ciarli and Ràfols, 2019 ; Confraria and Wang, 2020 ), we study at the SDG-country level if countries facing a major SDG challenge also prioritise research related to that specific SDG. We use the same two indicators computed above and calculate country scores by SDG. We begin this analytical section by plotting the SDG revealed research priorities of countries in 2015–2019, versus the SDG challenges between 2008 and 2017, to maximise the number of observations (these are the time intervals for which we can calculate more data points for all countries/SDGs). Then, we use multiple regression analysis (OLS) to assess if the correlations previously identified hold when controlling for other factors, and to understand how changes in SDG challenges dynamically influence SDG research priorities. We ask three main research questions that correspond to the three equations below:• RQ1: Are countries that score worst in a certain SDG specialised in research related to that SDG? (Eq. (5) )  • RQ2: Do countries that score worst in a certain SDG tend to change their specialisation towards research related to that SDG? (Eq. (7) )  • RQ3: Is a change in SDG scores associated to a change in SDG research specialisation? (Eq. (8) )    To reduce endogeneity issues in our regression analysis, our dependent variable is the SDG revealed research priorities of countries in 2018–2019, and our main independent variable the SDG scores of countries in 2013–2017. First, we estimate the static, cross country, relation between research specialisation by SDG-country in 2018–2019, and the past SDG Score (2013–2017). We use two specifications (RQ1 and RQ1*): in (Eq. (5) ) we simply estimate the relation between research specialisation by SDG-country in 2018–2019 and the past SDG Score (2013–2017) without controls; in (Eq. (6) ) we control for research productivity (number of publications per capita in a specific SDG-Country (2013–2014)) since countries have different resources to produce research,17  17 Countries with higher research productivity may be more likely to have the resources and expertise to conduct research on specific SDGs, not just those where they face major challenges. This could lead to a spurious correlation between SDG challenges and SDG research priorities.   and previous research specialisation (2013–2014) due to the path-dependent nature of scientific production18  18 Countries with a strong research tradition in a particular area may be more likely to continue to prioritise research in that area, even if they are not facing a major challenge in that area.  :(5) RCA c , s , t   = α + β 2  I c , s , t − 1   + ε c , s , t       (6) RCA c , s , t   = α + β 1  PUBS c , s , t − 1   + β 1  RCA c , s , t − 1   + β 2  I c , s , t − 1   + ε c , s , t      where RCA c , s , t     is the relative specialisation (revealed research priority) of country c , in SDG s , in period t  = 2018–2019; RCA c , s , t − 1     is the same index for period t-1 = 2013–2014; PUBS c , s , t − 1     is the number of publications per capita in SDG s  in t-1 = 2013–2014; I c , s , t − 1     our primary independent variable corresponded by the SDG score (challenge, between −1 and 1) for country c , in SDG s , in period t  = 2013–2017; ε c , s , t     is the error term. Second, we estimate the relation between the change in research specialisation by SDG-country between 2018–2019 and 2013–2014, and the past SDG Score (2008–2012), controlling for research productivity (the number of publications per capita in a specific SDG-Country (2013–2014)):(7) ∆ RCA c , s , t   = α + β 1  PUBS c , s , t − 1   + β 2  I c , s , t − 1   + ε c , s , t      where ∆ RCA c , s , t     is the difference in relative specialisation (revealed research priority) of country c , in SDG s , between 2018–2019 and 2013–2014; PUBS c , s , t − 1     is the number of publications per capita in SDG s  in t-1 = 2013–2014; I c , s , t − 1     the SDG score (challenge, between −1 and 1) for country c , in SDG s , in period t  = 2008–2012. Third, we estimate the relation between the change in research specialisation by SDG-country between 2018–2019 and 2013–2014, and the change in the SDG score between 2013 and 2017 and 2008–2012, controlling for research productivity (the number of publications per capita in a specific SDG-Country (2013–2014)):(8) ∆ RCA c , s , t   = α + β 1  PUBS c , s , t − 1   + β 2  ∆ I c , s , t − 1   + ε c , s , t      where ∆ I c , s , t − 1     the difference in the SDG score (challenge, between −1 and 1) for country c , in SDG s , between 2013–2017 and 2008–2012.   4 Results 4.1 Global relations between SDG challenges and research production per income group Our global analysis starts by examining the relation between our SDG score and the proportion of SDG related research across different income groups. Fig. 1   reveals a key finding: while low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle income countries (LMICs) tend to perform worst in most SDGs, researchers from these regions contribute to only a small fraction of SDG-related research, limiting the development of research capabilities related to these thematic areas. In contrast, most SDG-related research is heavily concentrated in High-Income Countries (HICs), where SDG scores are better across most SDGs. This concentration of SDG related research in HICs, as opposed to LICs, underscores a critical misalignment at the global level between SDG research production and SDG challenges, due the vast inequalities that exist in research capabilities and funding across countries. The 29 LICs contribute to <0.3 % of the SDG-related publications, while they have 8.2 % of the world's population.19  19 Population data was extracted from the World Bank data portal (data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL ).   The negligible involvement of researchers from LICs in SDG related research, limits the potential impact of research on their contexts. Research done by local scholars usually brings advantages related to ownership of the results, trust, sharing of expertise between researchers and policymakers, and increased contextualisation of findings. Without research capabilities, policymakers (and research users) in these countries, need to rely on research done elsewhere, which is likely less relevant to their contexts (Kraemer-Mbula et al., 2020 ). The relatively small amount of research produced in LICs relates mostly to SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and well-being), SDG5 (Gender equality), SDG13 (Climate action) and SDG15 (Life on land) which, together, represents >50 % of all the research done in the region. The 104 upper- and lower-middle income countries (UMICs and LMICs) produce proportionally less SDG-related research in all SDGs (32 %) than what they produce globally in all areas (37 %). When we look in detail, we find that this group of countries is more specialised than the world average in research relating to SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy), and less specialised in SDG5 (Gender equality), SDG10 (Reduced inequalities) and SDG16 (Peace, justice and institutions). Although it is a mixed group of countries, their SDG challenges tend to be related to SDG9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG14 (Life below water) and SDG15 (Life on land). China, India, Brazil and Russia, which comprise >75 % of the world's population and 27 % of global research, are included in this middle-income group and substantially shape these results. The 72 HICs produce the majority of all SDG-related research (68 %), while having only 16 % of the global population. They are relatively specialised in SDG4 (Quality education), SDG5 (Gender equality), SDG10 (Reduced inequalities) and SDG16 (Peace, justice and institutions). Their major SDG challenges are instead related to SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth),20  20 Interestingly, in relation to SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) dividing countries by income groups might not provide the most useful insights. For SDG 8, some indicators include the annual growth rate  of real GDP per capita/employed person, rather than the level  of per capita income. Since LICs and LMICs grew more during 2008–2017, they score more highly than HICs on this indicator.   SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG13 (Climate action). On average, we find that LICs and LMICs show more variation in SDG challenges and SDG research specialisation (see Fig. A.2  in the appendix). HICs and UMICs show less variation in SDG research specialisation and smaller SDG challenges (on average). We also calculated the correlation coefficient between SDG research priorities and SDG challenges, and plotted this new variable against a research concentration intensity score (Chi-square of sectoral specialisation used by Laursen (2000) ). In Fig. A.3 , in the appendix, we didn't find any significant relationship between these two variables. However, we find that LICs and LMICs tend to exhibit higher levels of SDG research concentration (narrow knowledge base) and HICs a broader knowledge base. Neither income level nor SDG research concentration seems to explain the levels of alignment (correlation between SDG challenges and SDG research priorities) of different countries.  4.2 Analysing alignment for individual countries The previous analysis gives us a broad picture of the misalignment between SDG challenges and SDG research capabilities in different income globally. The next question we explore is whether the SDG research priorities of specific countries are related to the major SDG challenges they face. Fig. 2   is intended to elucidate our concept of misalignments and the source of variation that we exploit in our main analysis.21  21 Figures for all countries are available here (from page 65 onwards): https://strings.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/STRINGS_SupplementaryFigures.pdf    We use Tanzania (LMIC), Argentina (UMIC) and Germany (HIC), demonstrating how this analytical approach can potentially guide the realignment of research priorities towards topics more closely aligned with each country's major challenges. Tanzania faces several challenges that are common in LICs and LMICs. These include issues relating to SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and well-being), SDG4 (Quality education), SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure). Regarding research priorities, although Tanzania produces a very low share of world research (<0.03 %), research in the country appears strongly related to almost all SDGs. The exception is SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy), in which Tanzania is one of the countries furthest away from the SDG frontier. Argentina instead shows a low alignment. It faces significant challenges in SDG9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG10 (Reduced inequalities) and SDG15 (Life on land), whereas its research priorities relate to SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG13 (Climate action), SDG14 (Life below water) and SDG15 (Life on land). The high level of research specialisation in SDG2 (Zero hunger) is surprising since hunger is not a major problem in Argentina compared with other countries. This specialisation might be related to Argentina's strong trade in cereal, soya and meat production,22  22 https://oec.world/en/profile/country/arg?depthSelector1=HS4Depth    and the consequent importance of agricultural productivity to the economy. This pattern of intensive agriculture might, in some cases, lead to unsustainable practices of land use and damage to terrestrial ecosystems, leading to a trade-off with SDG15 (Life on land), which presents a particular challenge in this country. Therefore, it is interesting to note the high research specialisation in SDG15, which focuses on issues such as the effects of land use in intensive cultivations on local biodiversity (Newbold et al., 2015 ) and the importance of soil science in challenges such as food security, water scarcity, climate change, biodiversity loss and health threats (Keesstra et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, the lack of research prioritisation in SDG9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG10 (Reduced inequalities) is worrying, given the significant challenge that Argentina faces in relation to these SDGs relative to other countries (e.g. Arza and López, 2021 ; Cimoli and Katz, 2003 ). Finally, Germany only has a major SDG challenge in SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production). Together with SDG13 (Climate action), these are the two SDGs in which most HICs perform worst and have higher challenges. However, the country does not specialise in research related to these SDGs. Their SDG research specialisation aligns with the World average (0), which is considered a misalignment.  4.3 Relations between SDG challenges and research priorities by SDG across countries To study whether SDG challenges in previous years influence countries' research priorities in later years, we analyse econometrically at the SDG level if countries facing higher SDG challenges tend to prioritise research related to that specific SDG. We start to exemplify our analysis with four scatter plots for illustrative purposes. In Fig. 3  , we analyse how the alignment between research priorities and major challenges differs for SDGs 2, 6, 12 and 13 (results for all other SDGs are in Fig. A.4 ). We found a pattern of alignment for SDG 2 (Zero hunger) and SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), meaning that those countries with more significant challenges in these SDG areas are conducting more research related to those SDGs than the average country. On the other hand, our analysis shows a misalignment pattern for both SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG13 (Climate action), meaning that countries with greater challenges in these SDGs (mostly HICs) are conducting relatively less research on those challenges than the average country. This is an undesirable pattern since it shows that countries with unsustainable consumption/production patterns and generating more CO2 emissions are usually HICs that do not specialise in research related to these challenges. These patterns are based on correlations between research specialisation and the SDG score and do not consider underlying confounding factors that may influence a country's specialisation in particular research topics. To address this, we use multiple regression analysis to control for factors such as path dependence (previous research specialisation) and country research productivity (number of publications per capita). We use the approach explained in Section 3.3  to ask three main research questions (see Table 1  ): Are countries that score worst in a certain SDG specialised in research related to that SDG? (RQ1); Do countries that score worst in a certain SDG tend to change their specialisation towards research related to that SDG? (RQ2); Is a change in SDG scores associated to a change in SDG research specialisation? (RQ3). Overall, we would expect a positive association in all these questions across all SDGs, given that a misalignment between research areas and SDG achievements may reduce the effectiveness of research to address those goals. However, we find an inconclusive relationship or misalignment between relative research specialisation and SDG challenges for most SDGs in all three research questions. For RQ1, we find positive significant associations in SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Health and Well-being), SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (Affordable Clean Energy) and SDG10 (Reduced inequalities). These are encouraging findings since they indicate that countries with severe challenges in these SDGs are specialised in research related to them, which should enable the development of research capabilities on issues that are relevant to these countries. However, this relation is not statistically significant for SDG3, SDG7 and SDG10 when we control for previous specialisation and scientific productivity in our regression analysis (RQ1* in Table 1 ). This implies that the positive association between research specialisation and SDG challenge for SDG3, SDG7 and SDG10 is mainly due to historical and long-term research specialisation in these areas, rather than to a reorientation of research priorities to changes in SDG challenges. These results were expected for SDG3, for example, since it is well known that LICs and LMICs have historically been specialised in health sciences (UNESCO, 2015 ), mainly due to the research funding priorities of aid agencies, philanthropists and other international funders (Confraria and Wang, 2020 ; Kozma et al., 2018 ). The SDGs for which we found a positive significant association between the severity of an SDG challenge and their relative SDG research priorities (RQ1*), or dynamic changes in research priorities (RQ2), are SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure). For SDG6, for example, this means that the countries furthest from the frontier are specialised (RQ1*) or becoming specialised (RQ2) in research related to SDG6. The five countries in which research on SDG6 represents the largest share of the SDG-related research portfolio are Bolivia, Benin, Ethiopia, Nepal and Zimbabwe. These countries are all LICs and LMICs which have experienced recent problems related to water governance (for example, the Cochabamba Water War in Bolivia23  23 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochabamba_Water_War   ), extreme droughts (for example, 2015–2016's El Niño-induced drought in Ethiopia24  24 https://medium.com/@UNmigration/overcoming-the-drought-in-ethiopia-afde894014bf   ) and sanitation challenges (such as lack of access to sanitation and water services in Nepal25  25 https://www.unicef.org/nepal/water-and-sanitation-wash   ). The good match between research priorities and SDG challenges, in this case, might be related to the occurrence of particular shocks, which incentivise national and international research funders to solve these issues. However, further research is needed to understand the causes of other alignments and misalignments between research priorities and SDG challenges. For all other SDGs, we found no alignment or a negative alignment. In the case of SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), the countries that have higher challenges are HICs that have unsustainable consumption and production patterns (RQ1*) and are becoming less specialised in research on these SDGs (RQ2). The most specialised countries in research areas related to SDG12 are LICs and LMICs. This is a severe misalignment since the countries producing more waste are expected to prioritise research related to sustainable use/management of resources and recycling processes. The results summarised in column RQ3 (Table 1 ) also suggest that alignment has been improving in SDG3 (Good health and well-being) and SDG13 (Climate action), indicating that countries with a growing (diminishing) challenge are more likely to increase (decrease) their research specialisation on these SDGs. Given that for SDG13 the coefficients in RQ1, RQ1* and RQ2 are negative, this is an encouraging result. Although the countries contributing more to climate change in relative terms (e.g. Qatar, Singapore, Kuwait) are not the ones prioritising research related to SDG13, the ones that are worsening their climate sustainability (e.g. China, Vietnam, Colombia, Turkey) are increasing their specialisation on SDG13 related research.   5 Discussion This paper provides different perspectives (global, country and SDG) to analyse how countries' research priorities align with their major SDG challenges. At the global level, we observe a stark misalignment. While most SDG challenges are more pronounced in LICs and LMICs, only a small fraction of SDG-related research occurs in these regions. This suggests that a major source of misalignment between research priorities and SDG challenges in the world is driven by the vast inequalities in research capabilities and funding across countries. Research users in LICs and LMICs need to rely on research done elsewhere, which may be less relevant to their contexts. At the country level, we create a methodology and visualisations that enable countries to have a better understanding (and more productive discussions with relevant stakeholders) of the research being prioritised, the capabilities created in the country, and the factors that might have led to the absence of research in areas related to their main SDG challenges. This mapping approach might be particularly relevant for countries with severe societal challenges (LICs and LMICs) since it is easier to identify clearer misalignments. At the SDG-country level, our findings indicate a positive relation between SDG challenges and SDG research prioritisation by country in some SDGs, including SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure). This indicates a certain degree of alignment between research priorities and SDG challenges across countries in these SDG areas. These are encouraging findings since they imply that countries with severe challenges in these SDGs specialise (and becoming specialised) in research related to them, which can enable the application of scientific knowledge on issues that are relevant to these countries. As for SDG3 (Health Well-being), SDG7 (Affordable Clean Energy) and SDG10 (Reducing Inequalities), we also found a positive alignment between SDG challenges and SDG research priorities. However, when controlling for other factors, we found that this alignment seems to be more related to historical patterns of research specialisation (and potential international research funding patterns) than to research priorities chosen based on current challenges. We instead found a negative or inconclusive relationship between research prioritisation and SDG challenges for all other SDGs. In SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), for example, the countries with the most unsustainable consumption/production patterns are usually HICs that are not specialised (or becoming specialised) in research related to these themes. This is a severe misalignment since the countries producing more waste are expected to prioritise research related to sustainable use/management of resources and recycling processes, enabling them to create solutions to these unsustainable consumption/production patterns. In conclusion, we find that research prioritisation should be more responsive to national SDG challenges. We find a certain degree of alignment for some countries (and SDGs), but the broader picture is of misalignment between research priorities and SDG challenges. Furthermore, since most SDG challenges are worst in LICs and LMICs, and they tend to focus their research on issues related to the SDGs, we suggest that increasing funding in these countries would potentially boost research related to the SDGs. Lastly, we need to mention that this study has some limitations related to the uncertainty and ambiguity of our estimates of SDG research priorities (Armitage et al., 2020 ; Purnell, 2022 ) and SDG challenges (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ). Our results are conditional on the assumptions made. They are designed more as a tool to explore and discuss potential misalignments between research priorities and SDG-related challenges than as an accurate measurement of those (mis)alignments. For example, further research is needed on the marginal impact of increasing SDG-related research investments on achieving a particular SDG. This impact may not be the same for all SDGs. Local research in health (SDG3) may lead to significant improvements in the health outcomes of a country, but more local research on poverty (SDG1), for example, may not produce similar improvements in reducing poverty. Future studies should look carefully at these differences and consider synergies and trade-offs between SDGs. These factors may help improve research prioritisation and enable the building of research capabilities to address specific challenges. Another important theoretical aspect to consider when thinking about developing research capabilities to address societal challenges, such as the SDGs, is that influencing scientists to change their research trajectories is costly and hard (Myers, 2020 ). The increasing specialisation of expertise (Jones, 2009 ), the nature of scientific incentives and culture (Azoulay et al., 2019 ; Bhattacharya and Packalen, 2020 ), and the lower probability of researchers having higher impact in different fields (Hill et al., 2021 ; Zeng et al., 2019 ), might push them to avoid exploring novel research directions. Therefore, research funders need to be aware of such barriers when steering research funds to areas related to SDGs, especially in LICs and LMICs where critical mass across fields is lower (Confraria et al., 2017 ).
