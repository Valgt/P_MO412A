                  17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) were committed by 193 countries in 2015. Assessing the spatio-temporal progress of achieving the SDGs can help to track the global sustainable development progress and identify critical development issues to eventually accelerate the achievement of SDGs. However, there is a lack of methods for the quantitative assessment of the progress of achieving SDGs at the regional level (above the national level), especially systematic methods that can simultaneously assess regions along the “Belt and Road”. To fill this research gap, after classifying 17 SDGs into four dimensions (society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation), we have developed the Composite SDG Index to represent the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs. Specifically, the index is constructed by two sub-indices, including the SDG subindex used to assess the overall performance of achieving the four dimensional SDGs and the Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex used for the first time in the SDG assessment to measure the coupling coordination degree between the four SDG dimensions. To implement this methodological framework, we chose 15 countries along the “Belt and Road” as the case study, and used 108 indicators to assess the performance of achieving SDGs for these countries. Eventually, various national development models and related policy recommendations were proposed. The three indices included in the methodological framework developed in this study can effectively enhance the global stakeholders' mutual understanding of the progress of achieving SDGs to support regional coordinated planning and national-level strategic decision-making.

Assessing the spatio-temporal progress of achieving the SDGs can help to track the global sustainable development progress and identify critical development issues to eventually accelerate the achievement of SDGs. However, there is a lack of methods for the quantitative assessment of the progress of achieving SDGs at the regional level (above the national level), especially systematic methods that can simultaneously assess regions along the “Belt and Road”. To fill this research gap, after classifying 17 SDGs into four dimensions (society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation), we have developed the Composite SDG Index to represent the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs. Specifically, the index is constructed by two sub-indices, including the SDG subindex used to assess the overall performance of achieving the four dimensional SDGs and the Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex used for the first time in the SDG assessment to measure the coupling coordination degree between the four SDG dimensions. To implement this methodological framework, we chose 15 countries along the “Belt and Road” as the case study, and used 108 indicators to assess the performance of achieving SDGs for these countries. Eventually, various national development models and related policy recommendations were proposed. The three indices included in the methodological framework developed in this study can effectively enhance the global stakeholders' mutual understanding of the progress of achieving SDGs to support regional coordinated planning and national-level strategic decision-making.

The 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) (including 169 targets) were committed by 193 countries in 2015 to guide the global sustainable development progress until 2030 (United Nations, 2015 ). Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the performance of achieving SDGs at various levels including regional, national and sub-national over time can especially help countries to identify vital issues of their own sustainable development progresses and the gaps of those progresses between countries, so that countries can better take targeted policy actions to achieve these ambitious SDGs (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Since 2016, the assessment and analysis of SDGs above the national level (regional level and global level) made by countries, organizations and researchers from all over the world have mainly included assessment of the progress of achieving SDGs (e.g., Allen et al., 2017 ; Campagnolo et al., 2018 ; Clark et al., 2018 ; Clark and Kavanagh, 2017 ; Lior et al., 2017 ; Mateusz et al., 2018 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ), interactions between goals and targets (e.g., Allen et al., 2019 ; Collste et al., 2017 ; Le Blanc, 2015 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Zhou and Moinuddin, 2017 ), and projections of SDGs performance (e.g., Lozano et al., 2018 ; Nicolai et al., 2015 ; OECD, 2017 ). However, for most studies that used indicators to construct evaluation indexes of progress of achieving SDGs above the national level (e.g., Allen et al., 2017 ; Campagnolo et al., 2018 ; Clark and Kavanagh, 2017 ; Lior et al., 2017 ; Mateusz et al., 2018 ; Sachs et al., 2018 ), the indicators did not fully assess the performance of achieving all the 17 SDGs, even if some indicators were comprehensive and representative. Meanwhile, few studies focused on the countries joining the “Belt and Road” initiative (BRI) as an overall assessment area. The BRI was proposed by China in 2013 (Ding et al., 2018 ) with the construction of the “Silk Road Economic Belt” and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road”. Its overall goal is to eventually build “a community with a shared future for mankind” (including five aspects: politics, security, economy, civilization, and ecology) (Ding et al., 2018 ). It can be said that there is an internally unified logic between the BRI and the concept of sustainable development, especially that the final vision of BRI and SDGs are highly consistent. Promoting the construction of the “Belt and Road” can bring new opportunities for the achievement of SDGs, and SDGs (especially the monitoring and assessment of SDGs) also have critical guiding significance for the construction of the “Belt and Road” (for example, standardizing the implementation of the “Belt and Road” construction projects under the SDGs framework; strengthening the cooperation on the construction of the “Belt and Road” for certain goals, based on the assessment of performance of achieving SDGs). This study aims to address the following questions: 1. How can we quantitatively assess the regional progress of achieving SDGs (such as the entire region along the “Belt and Road”) on the basis of identifying the interrelationships among multiple dimensions (such as society, economy and environment) of SDGs? 2. If we conduct the empirical research on the effectiveness of this quantitative method by using some countries along the “Belt and Road” as the case study, how were the progress of achieving SDGs for these countries? 3. Based on the evaluation results, how can these countries improve the comprehensive performance of future SDGs, especially during the future “Belt and Road” construction? To answer these questions, we firstly selected 15 countries along the “Belt and Road”. Secondly, after 17 SDGs and 169 targets were divided into four dimensions (including society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation) primarily based on the theories of the BRI, a total of 108 indicators and annual time series data at the national level from 2000 to 2018 were used to construct the newly proposed Composite SDG Index. Then, scores of this index (0–1) were calculated to assess the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs for each country over time. Specifically, the index was constructed by two sub-indices, including the SDG subindex used to assess the overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs and the Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex used for the first time in the SDGs assessment to measure the coupling coordination degree between the four SDGs dimensions. Finally, based on the evaluation results together with the future direction and content of the “Belt and Road” construction, we proposed three national development models and related policy recommendations to promote the progress of achieving SDGs.  2 Materials and methods For the pilot area (15 countries), we used six interrelated steps to measure and compare the progress of achieving SDGs (Fig. 1  ). 2.1 An overview of the study area The BRI is an open international economic cooperation network with no strictly defined spatial scope. However, when the BRI was initiated in 2013, China announced 64 countries as the initial focus of the “Belt and Road” construction (65 countries including China). The region composed of these 65 countries along the “Belt and Road” extending from the Western Pacific to the Baltic Sea. Its land area (51.63 million km2 ), total population (4.7246 billion), and gross domestic product (GDP) (28.3656 trillion current US $) in 2018 accounted for approximately 39.1%, 62.21%, and 33% of the world, respectively(World Bank, 2019a ). Besides, the BRI proposed to establish six major international economic cooperation corridors (Office of the Leading Group for the Belt and Road Initiative, 2017 ) including a new Eurasian Land Bridge, China-Mongolia-Russia, China-Central Asia-West Asia, China-Indochina Peninsula, China-Pakistan, Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar. According to these six international economic corridors, this study divided 64 countries along the “Belt and Road” originally announced by China into six regions, including Central Asia, Mongolia and Russia, Southeast Asia, West Asia/Middle East, South Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe. Based on the division of these six regions, the 15 countries selected in this study as the case study (Fig. 2  ) are distributed in Central Asia, West Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe. In total, these 15 countries' land area (22.306 million km2 ), total population (313.719 million), and gross domestic product (GDP) (2329.017 billion current US $) in 2018 accounted for approximately 16.895%, 4.13%, and 2.68% of the world, respectively (World Bank, 2019a ). Table S1 further describes the basic characteristics of these 15 countries.  2.2 Constructing indicator framework and database First, based on the core goals and construction direction of the BRI, the interpretation of SDGs in the “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, and other studies that divided SDGs because of different research needs (e.g., Allen et al., 2017 ; Clark and Kavanagh, 2017 ; Collste et al., 2017 ; Huan et al., 2019 ; Lim et al., 2018 ; Spaiser et al., 2017 ), the 17 SDGs and 169 corresponding targets were aggregated into four dimensions, including society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation (Supplementary information). Since three of the dimensions (society, economy, and environment) are interrelated, it can be argued that some social goals and corresponding targets should be classified into the dimensions of economy or environment, and vice versa (Huan et al., 2019 ). Second, for each goal and its corresponding targets, we selected as many evaluation indicators as possible from three sources (SDGs global indicator framework published by the United Nations Statistics Division (Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators, 2018 ; United Nations, 2019 ), the World Development Indicators provided by the World Bank (World Bank, 2019b ), and the Sustainable Development Report 2019 (Sachs et al., 2019 )) to construct a complete indicator framework which can be used to assess all 17 SDGs (Supplementary information). Based on this indicator framework, we collected relevant data of 15 countries between 2000 and 2018 from the above three sources (Sachs et al., 2019 ; United Nations, 2019 ; World Bank, 2019b ) since they also contain database corresponding to the indicators. Then, according to data availability, the indicator framework was adjusted to reduce biases caused by missing data. Specifically, for each indicator in turn, we simultaneously compared the time series data of all 15 countries, and deleted the indicators that not all countries had at least one year of data. Eventually, we included 108 indicators to assess the four dimensional SDGs (17 goals) (Table 1  ). Fig. S1 and Table S2 present the data availability of indicators for 15 countries from 2000 to 2018. Overall, among all 15 countries, Moldova has the best data availability (87.28%), while Turkmenistan has the worst (62.48%). Of all 19 years, the year 2010 contains the best data availability (87.28%), whereas 2003 has the worst (60.62%) (Supplementary information). Third, for the time series (2000–2018) data of 15 countries, we used boxplots developed by John W. Tukey (1970, 1977)  to sequentially test outliers in time series data of each indicator in each country (Frigge et al., 1989 ), then deleted some outliers according to the content of indicators and actual national situation of sustainable development (Supplementary information). Since the complete time series data are critical for constructing assessment models (Little and Rubin, 2002 ), Akima spline interpolation, cubic spline interpolation (de Boor, 1978 ), linear interpolation (Blu et al., 2004 ), and average value of existing time series data were used in this study to interpolate the missing data to increase the accuracy of the assessment to a certain extent (Sachs et al., 2018 ).  2.3 Normalization In the sustainability assessment, due to the difference in measurement and unit dimension for different indicators, the data need to be normalized (Peng et al., 2015 ). In this study, after interpolation, the linear extreme value processing method was used to normalize the raw data (Eqs. (1) , (2) , (3) , (4) , (5) ), and the data value of each indicator will vary between [0, 1] (Zhu et al., 2019 ). This method needs to firstly determine the sign (positive, negative, and neutral/moderate) of each indicator, then use Eq. (1)  for the positive indicator (the higher data value of the indicator, the better performance of sustainable development), Eq. (2)  for the negative indicator (the lower data value of the indicator, the better performance of sustainable development), and Eqs. (3), (4) and (5)  for the moderate indicator (the closer the data value to a moderate value, the better performance of sustainable development), respectively.(1) y ij  = x ijk  − x i min   x i max  − x i min       (2) y ij  = x i max  − x ijk   x i max  − x i min       (3) y ij  = 1 − x q  − x ijk   max x q  − x i min   x i max  − x q      , x ij  < x q     (4) y ij  = 1 − x ijk  − x q   max x q  − x i min   x i max  − x q      , x ij  > x q     (5) y ij  = 1 , x ij  = x q      In Eqs. (1)–(5) , y ij   is the data value of indicator i for country j after normalization; x ijk   represents the data value of the indicator i for the country j in the year k; x i  min   and x i  max   represent the minimum and maximum data value of the indicator i for all 15 countries in all 19 years, respectively; x q   is the moderate data value of the moderate indicator. In this study, the moderate indicators are indicators 28 and 29 (Table 1 ), and x q   for both of these two indicators equal 1.  2.4 Weighting The weight for an indicator is a quantitative expression relative to the importance of other indicators used in the assessment, and can specify the “correct” relationship between the indicators (Böhringer and Jochem, 2007 ). In this study, we used the entropy method which can better avoid the assessment bias to a certain extent compared to subjective weighting (such as the Delphi method). Notably, we gave each of the four SDG dimensions the same weight, because these four dimensions are interconnected and influential, and play a common supporting role for sustainable development (Collste et al., 2017 ; Lim et al., 2018 ; Spaiser et al., 2017 ). Thus, we used the entropy method once for weighting the evaluation indicators of each SDG dimension, and eventually used the entropy method four times in total for weighting the indicators of the four SDG dimensions. In addition, since there are logarithms in the calculation of the entropy method and negative values they cannot be directly used for the calculation. We improved the traditional entropy method by combining the linear extreme value processing method used in the previous section, then gave the indicators weights (Eqs. (6) , (7) , (8) , (9) ) (Guo, 1998 ).(6) s ij  = y ij  ∑ j = 1  n  y ij       (7) e i  = − ∑ j = 1  n  s ij  ln s ij   ln n      (8) g i  = 1 − e i     (9) w i  = g i  ∑ i = 1  m  g i        In Eqs. (6)–(9) , y ij   is the data value of indicator i for country j after normalization; s ij   is the proportion of y ij   in indicator i; e i   is the entropy value of the indicator i; g i   is the information utility value of the indicator i; w i   is the weight of the indicator i.  2.5 Composite SDG index Through constructing and combining two sub-indexes: SDG subindex and the Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex, we further constructed the Composite SDG Index and used its scores to evaluate the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs for countries over time, including the following three steps. First, we constructed the SDG subindex and used its score (0–1) to assess the overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs (including society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation) for each country over time. In particular, Eqs. (10), (11), (12), and (13)  were used to assess the performance of achieving four SDGs dimensions, respectively. As described above, each SDG dimension was given the same weight (0.25), thus, the SDG subindex was constructed by Eq. (14) .(10) D 1 jk   = ∑ i = 1  44  w i  y ijk     (11) D 2 jk   = ∑ i = 45  60  w i  y ijk     (12) D 3 jk   = ∑ i = 61  83  w i  y ijk     (13) D 4 jk   = ∑ i = 84  108  w i  y ijk     (14) S jk  = 0.25 × D 1 jk   + D 2 jk   + D 3 jk   + D 4 jk         In Eqs. (10)–(14) , D 1jk  , D 2jk  , D 3jk   and D 4jk   represent the performance of achieving SDGs of society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation, respectively, for the country j in the year k; w i   is the weight of the indicator i; y ijk   is the normalized data value of indicator i for the country j in year k; S jk   is the overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs for the country j in the year k. Second, the coupling coordination degree reflects the degree of harmony in the interaction of several systems within a region during the development progress (Fang et al., 2016 ). The characteristics, structure and functions of the four SDG dimensions are different, and their respective existence and development also affect and restrict each other (Collste et al., 2017 ; Lim et al., 2018 ). The achievement of SDGs is also largely related to the interaction between these dimensions. If the development between each dimension is not coordinated, the progress of achieving SDG will be hindered. Therefore, we used the model of coupling coordination degree (Eqs. (15) , (16) , (17) ) derived from the initial concept and model of the capacity coupling in physics to construct the Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex (Jiang et al., 2017 ; Tang, 2016 ). Its score (0–1) represents the coupling coordination degree between four dimensions of SDGs, and was used to assist in the assessment of the progress of achieving comprehensive SDGs.(15) C jk  = D 1 jk   × D 2 jk   × D 3 jk   × D 4 jk    D 1 jk   + D 2 jk   + D 3 jk   + D 4 jk    4   4    1 4      (16) S jk  = β 1  D 1 jk   + β 2  D 2 jk   + β 3  D 3 jk   + β 4  D 4 jk      (17) CC jk  = C jk  × S jk        In Eqs. (15)–(17) , C jk   is the coupling degree between four SDG dimensions for the country j in the year k; D 1jk  , D 2jk  , D 3jk   and D 4jk   represent the performance of achieving SDGs of society, economy, environment, mean of implementation and cooperation for the country j in the year k, respectively; S jk   is the overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs for the country j in the year k; β 1 , β 2 , β 3 , and β 4  represent the weight of four SDGs dimensions (as described above, each of dimension has the same weight (0.25)), respectively; CC jk   is the coupling coordination degree between four SDGs dimensions for the country j in the year k. Third, we used Eq. (18)  to constructed the Composite SDG Index and used its score (0–1) to finally assess the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs for each country over time.(18) CSDG jk  = S jk  × CC jk        In Eq. (18) , CSDG jk   represents the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs for the country j in the year k; S jk   is the overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs for the country j in the year k; CC jk   is the coupling coordination degree between four SDGs dimensions for the country j in the year k.  2.6 The sustainability and urgency of the progress of achieving SDGs From 2000 to 2018, the performance of achieving SDGs in each year can be regarded as a dynamic progress. We used Eq. (19)  to evaluate whether the performance of achieving SDGs for various regions had been moving in the positive direction in 19 years (that is, the sustainability of the progress of achieving SDGs). Also, Eq. (20)  was further used to assess the urgency to improve the sustainability of progress of achieving SDGs (Peng et al., 2015 ). These two equations provide a mechanism to obtain the results of two new variables based on the previous calculation results to further assist in the analysis of the progress of achieving SDGs for various countries. Fig. 3   indicates the general decision-making framework for such undertaking.(19) V j  = CSDG jk 2   − CSDG jk 1    k 2 − k 1      (20) U j  = ∑ j = 1  j = 15   CSDG jk 1    15  − CSDG jk 2    k 2 − k 1       In Eqs. (19)–(20) , V j   is the sustainability of the progress of achieving SDGs for the country j during a certain period; k2 and k1 are the ending and starting time of this certain period, respectively; CSDG jk 2  and CSDG jk 1  are the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs for the country j in the year k2 and k1, respectively; U j   is the urgency for improving the sustainability of progress of achieving SDGs.  2.7 Benchmarking and vizualisation The calculation results of the Composite SDG Index, SDG subindex and Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex were divided into different levels, which contain a total of 3 levels and the corresponding seven sub-levels (since the values of the calculation results are all between [0, 1], a unified standard of the level division was adopted). In addition, we innovatively designed different weather symbols to represent these 7 sub-levels (Fig. 4  ).  2.8 Sensitivity analysis For assessing the sensitivity of the scores of the Composite SDG Index to different values of variables that affect those scores, we conducted the sensitivity analysis (Turner et al., 1994 ) by applying a widely used sensitivity index (Liu and Ashton, 1998 ) which can measure the degree of sensitivity (Eq. (21) ).(21) SI = MCSDG jk  − CSDG jk   CSDG jk   My ijk  − y i jk    y ijk        In Eq. (21) , y ijk   represents the normalized data value of the indicator i for the country j in the year k; My ijk   represents the modified normalized data value of the indicator i for the country j in the year k; CSDG jk   represents the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs for the country j in the year k under the original condition; MCSDG jk   represents the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs for the country j in the year k under a modified condition caused by the change in the data value of indicator i for the country j in the year k; SI  represents the change in the scores of the Composite SDG Index due to the change in the data value of a certain indicator. We separately decreased and increased the value for each indicator by 10% for all 15 countries and recalculated their scores of the Composite SDG Index.   3 Results 3.1 Two related assessments of the performance of four dimensional SDGs As two subindices of Composite SDG Index, SDG subindex and Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex were calculated in turn and the results are assessed in two following parts in this section. 3.1.1 The overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs For the national level, the higher score (0–1) of the SDG subindex for a country in one year represents the better overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs (society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation) for that country. Our results (Fig. 5  , Tables S3 and S5)showed that 14 countries either slightly or significantly improved their overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs over time, and the change ranged from a 5.66% increase (Tajikistan) to a 57.02% increase (Lithuania), except that Turkmenistan's performance remained unchanged during its long-term fluctuations. In particular, from 2000 to 2018, among the 15 countries, Russia had the best overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs (from 0.3914 to 0.5579), while Uzbekistan and Tajikistan had the worst long-term performance (from 0.2155 to 0.2554, and from 0.2323 to 0.2454, respectively) (Fig. 5 , Table S3). Notably, for the average performance of each SDG dimension for all 15 countries, although only social SDGs had been getting worse over time (a 15.62% decrease), the average performance of achieving social SDGs for all 15 countries from 2000 to 2018 had been still better than the other three dimensional SDGs, and both of the average performance of achieving economic and environmental SDGs for 15 countries had been the worst over time (almost no countries got scores above 0.5 which is the half of the total score) (Fig. 6  , Table S5). For the regional level (composed by 15 countries), five countries (Russia, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Belarus belonging to Central and Eastern Europe) located in the north and northwest of the pilot region achieved the best overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs from 2000 to 2018 (the average scores of the subindex for each country in 19 years ranged from 0.3466 (Belarus) to 0.4651 (Russia)), and this area acquired the most obvious improvement of the overall performance (Fig. 5 , Tables S3 and S5). However, four countries (Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan belonging to Central Asia) in the south-southwest of the sample region had the worst overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs over time (the average scores of the subindex for each country in 19 years ranged from 0.2349 (Uzbekistan) to 0.2658 (Turkmenistan)), and this area had the smallest improvement of the overall performance (Fig. 5 , Tables S3 and S5).  3.1.2 The coupling coordination performance of four dimensional SDGs For the national level, the higher score (0–1) of the Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex for a country in one year means the better the coupling coordination degree between the four SDGs dimensions and the more possibility that these dimensions can jointly promote the progress of sustainable development of that country. Our results showed that all 15 countries had improved scores of the Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex over time (Fig. 7  , Table S3), and the change ranged from a 3.66% increase (Turkmenistan) to a 32.19% increase (Estonia) (Table S4). In particular, from 2000 to 2018, among the 15 countries, the four SDGs dimensions of Russia presented the best synergies among each other (from 0.6020 to 0.7392), whereas the four SDGs dimensions of both Uzbekistan and Tajikistan showed the worst coupling coordination degree among each other (their scores never exceeded 0.5 which is the half of the total score) (Fig. 7 , Table S3). For the regional level (composed by 15 countries), from 2000 to 2018, the four SDGs dimensions of 5 countries (Russia, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia belonging to Central and Eastern Europe) in the north and northwest of the sample region had the best synergies among each other (the average scores of the subindex for each country in 19 years ranged from 0.5587 (Belarus) to 0.6687 (Russia)), and the coupling coordination degree among four SDGs dimensions of this area made the most obvious improvement (Fig. 7 , Tables S3 and S5). However, except that four SDGs dimensions of Armenia and 3 countries (Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan belonging to Central Asia) that in the south of the sample region had the worst coupling coordination degree from 2000 to 2011, countries with the worst synergies did not show obvious geographic spatial agglomeration since 2012 (Tables S3 and S5).   3.2 The comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs For the national level, the higher score (0–1) of the Composite SDG Index for a country in one year implies the better the composite performance of achieving SDGs for that country and the more likely it can achieve SDGs in 2030. Our results showed that all 15 countries have improved their composite performance of achieving SDGs over time (Fig. 8  , Table S3), and the change ranged from a 1.83% increase (Turkmenistan) to a 43.67% increase (Estonia) (Table S4). In particular, from 2000 to 2018, among the 15 countries, Russia had the best composite performance of achieving SDGs (from 0.4854 to 0.6422), whereas Uzbekistan and Tajikistan showed the worst composite performance (from 0.2989 to 0.3254, and from 0.3301 to 0.3412, respectively) (Fig. 8 , Table S3), and these two countries happened to have the highest urgency to improve the sustainability of the progress of achieving SDGs, even if their progress had been sustainable from 2000 to 2018 (Figs. 4 and 9  ). Due to the long territory of Russia, if it is regarded as two parts (east and west) divided equally, the remaining 14 countries are all bordered on the west part (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, for the entire west half of the pilot region (composed of 15 countries), four countries (Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania belonging to Central and Eastern Europe) gathered in the north and northwest area had the best composite performance of achieving SDGs from 2000 to 2018 (the average scores of the Index for each country in 19 years ranged from 0.5014 (Lithuania) to 0.5575 (Russia)), and this area had the most improvement of the composite performance (Fig. 10  , Tables S3 and S5). However, scores of the Index for other countries never exceeded 0.5, which is half of the total score. In particular, for the entire west half of the pilot region, three countries (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia belonging to West Asia) that located in the southeast area and especially five countries (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan belonging to Central Asia) gathered in the south area had the worst composite performance of achieving SDGs over time (the average scores of the Index for each country in 19 years ranged from 0.3257 (Uzbekistan) to 0.3802 (Georgia)), and the south area had the smallest improvement of the composite performance (Fig. 10 , Tables S3 and S5). Notably, it can be seen that from 2000 to 2018, both of the overall performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs and the coupling coordination degree of four SDGs dimensions for 15 countries were the worst in 2000, making the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs in 2000 the worst compared to all years, whereas 2018 was the best performer in 19 years (Figs. 5, 7, 8 , Table S5). As for the results of the sensitivity test, it showed that the sensitivity of the Composite SDG Index scores to changes in an indicator's data value is very small (<0.1) (Table S6).   4 Discussion 4.1 Three models and related suggestions to promote the progress of achieving SDGs The complex structure of the Composite SDG Index means that there are many factors that simultaneously determine the score of the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs for a country. Based on the assessment results of 15 countries, and combined with the future construction direction and content of the “Belt and Road”, we proposed the following three development models and related policy suggestions to help countries for improving the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs. 4.1.1 Model 1: sustaining the existing performance then developing towards higher-quality Those countries with a relatively high level of the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs should adopt this development model, such as Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania (Fig. 8 , Table S3). Specifically, from 2000 to 2018, compared to the other 11 countries, these four countries belonging to the Central and Eastern Europe had the best overall performance of achieving the four dimensional SDGs, and their four SDGs dimensions showed the best coupling coordination degree (Figs. 5 and 7 ). Therefore, the existing valuable achievements of various SDGs dimensions that countries already made and the general progress of sustainable development need to be fully consolidated. In particular, for the construction projects of the “Belt and Road”, they should especially pay attention to the implementation of the concepts of the “Green Silk Road” put forward by the BRI, and can further steadily move towards higher-quality sustainable development (Supplementary information).  4.1.2 Model 2: prioritizing the achievement of a certain SDGs dimension From 2000 to 2018, compared to the other SDGs dimensions, the economic and environmental SDGs for 8 countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine) were the worst (Fig. 6 ), which limited the improvement of the overall performance of achieving the four dimensional SDGs (Fig. 5 ), causing that the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs fluctuating around the medium level (Fig. 8 ). Therefore, these countries should especially adopt this development model that is to prioritize on achieving economic and environmental SDGs. In the case of not damaging the environment as much as possible, countries should make full use of the “Belt and Road” construction in key projects (such as projects related to “facilities connectivity” and “unimpeded trade”) to vigorously promote the economic development (Supplementary information).  4.1.3 Model 3: simultaneous promoting the progress of achieving all SDGs dimensions From 2000 to 2018, 3 countries (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan) gathered in the Central Asia had the worst performance of achieving four dimensional SDGs and also the worst synergies among four SDGs dimensions (Figs. 5 and 7 ).These countries with the long-term worst comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs (Fig. 8 , Table S3) should adopt this development model. They urgently need to attach great importance to the achievement of SDGs by 2030, and further comprehensively integrate the BRI with their own existing development strategies, plans, and policies. Furthermore, sectors and actors should work together across social, economic, environmental, and other necessary SDGs dimensions to simultaneously formulate development policies (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ) to promote the progress of achieving all SDGs dimensions (especially for economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation) (Supplementary information).   4.2 The advantages of the assessment framework Using 15 countries along the “Belt and Road” as the case study, we conducted the empirical research on the quantitative method that is designed for assessing regional progress of achieving SDGs. Through this empirical research, it can be seen that there are plenty of advantages of the methodological framework we constructed. First, since we classified SDGs into four dimensions (society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation) primarily based on the core goals and construction direction of the BRI, it ensures that the best assessment targets should be the regions along the “Belt and Road”, especially the countries in that region that have already joined the BRI. This SDG classification ensures the assessment results can directly serve the “Belt and Road” construction of various countries. It can also realize further clustering of indicators, which firstly reduce the uncertainty of assessment due to large amount of missing data in some indicators, and secondly alleviate the burden of evaluating and analyzing each specific indicator in the national report, and finally assist researchers and policy-makers to conduct macro-analysis and overall planning of the progress of achieving SDG at the national level and above. Second, the SDGs framework covers a wide range of sustainable development content, such as the four major aspects of sustainable development (society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation), and other sustainable development enablers, such as institutional coherence, policy coherence, and accountability (Ordaz, 2019 ). Without a method that has sound principles and procedures to select or design evaluation indicators, the SDGs assessment may become vague and confusing (Hák et al., 2016 ). In particular, when fewer indicators are used to evaluate SDGs (the number of indicators used in most existing assessments above the national level is 14–64 (e.g., Allen et al., 2017 ; Campagnolo et al., 2018 ; Clark and Kavanagh, 2017 ; Lior et al., 2017 ; Mateusz et al., 2018 ; Sachs et al., 2018 )), even if these indicators have certain comprehensiveness and representativeness, they may still reduce or reorient the content of goals and targets (Huan et al., 2019 ). Therefore, for the numerous and complex goals and targets in the SDG framework, we selected as many evaluation indicators (108 in total) as possible based on the availability of national data. Through this way of increasing the number of evaluation indicators, the uncertainty and incompleteness of the assessment were reduced (Xu et al., 2020 ). Third, since countries are located in different geographical regions, and they have been facing different development and cooperation demands, a flexible indicator framework is particularly important for the assessment above the national level (Huan et al., 2019 ), especially critical for future research that will assess more countries based on this study. The construction steps and principles of the final indicator framework we used in this study ensure an indicator framework that can dynamically change in the future as the evaluation object changes. In the future, when evaluating other regions, researchers can review more in-depth indicators and make adjustments based on the final indicator framework used in this study and the actual data availability of those countries in different geographic regions. Fourth, four SDG dimensions interconnected and influenced each other and together support the sustainable development (Collste et al., 2017 ; Lim et al., 2018 ). Flexible methods of weighting may indirectly encourage countries to prioritize the simple SDG dimensions, while ignoring those SDG dimensions that are equally important and actually require deeper transformation and development. Therefore, when constructing the Composite SDG Index, we gave the four SDG dimensions the same weight to not only help countries that use our methodological framework to assess the progress of achieving SDGs to pay equal attention to all SDG dimensions, but also inspire countries to focus on those SDG dimensions that are furthest from achievement, in order to improve the comprehensive performance of future SDGs. Fifth, SDG framework is currently the latest global consensus in the field of sustainable development (Scherer et al., 2018 ; United Nations, 2015 ), and its proposal has further transformed the sustainable development from a conceptual political agenda to a measurement standard supported by data and quantitative methods (Stafford-Smith et al., 2018 ). Assessing performance of achieving SDGs for the region is actually assessing the sustainable development of the region. On the one hand, in those evaluations that were not specifically for SDG performance but only for the progress of sustainable development, many studies developed and used different coupling coordination models based on the initial concept and models of the capacity coupling in physics to extensively evaluate the coupling coordination degree of the human and natural system, and they used this degree to reflect the state of sustainable development of the study area. These assessments studied the interrelationships among society, economy, resource, ecology, energy and environment (e.g., Fan et al., 2018 ; Guan et al., 2011 ; Yang et al., 2014 ; Zhang et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, for those assessments of the progress of achieving SDGs, most of them constructed and used the indices to evaluate the comprehensive performance of each goal and all 17 goals (e.g., Allen et al., 2017 ; Lior et al., 2017 ; Sachs et al., 2018 ), or firstly classified the 17 goals into several SDG dimensions (such as society, economy and environment) and then evaluated the respective or comprehensive performance of achieving these SDG dimensions (e.g., Campagnolo et al., 2018 ; Clark et al., 2018 ; Clark and Kavanagh, 2017 ). However, except for some studies that specifically quantify the interrelationships between goals or targets or indicators (e.g., Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Zhou and Moinuddin, 2017 ), there are few quantitative assessments of the interactions between multiple dimensions contained in the SDG framework (e.g., Collste et al., 2017 ; Scherer et al., 2018 ). In particular, those assessments of the overall performance of achieving SDGs based on assessing multiple SDG dimensions did not objectively reflect the coordination between the various SDGs dimensions. The final achievement of SDGs is the results of minimizing the mutual constraints between different goals (or SDGs dimensions), and maximizing the synergies between different goals (or SDG dimensions), instead of the simple combination after achieving each goal (OECD, 2016 ). Clarifying the interrelationships among the various SDG dimensions and even each goal is crucial for achieving SDGs at low costs and high efficiency (Zhou and Moinuddin, 2017 ). Therefore, based on the relevant studies that used the coupling coordination degree to evaluate the progress of sustainable development, this study is the first to construct and uses the Coupling Coordinated SDG subindex to assess the coupling coordination degree of various SDG dimensions. This subindex was then innovatively used to construct the Composite SDG Index. In the overall performance and interrelationships of four SDG dimensions, the Composite SDG Index reflects the comprehensive performance of achieving SDGs. Sixth, for the calculation results of the three indices in this study, we innovatively designed and used 7 weather symbols (Fig. 4 , Table S3) to help understanding and explaining the performance or status in relation to a relevant benchmark (Allen et al., 2017 ), thus speeding up the comparison and analysis of the output results. This kind of visualization tool is an effective way to enable stakeholders to discuss SDGs and related assessments, especially in the case where multiple indices are used in the assessment.  4.3 The limitations of the assessment framework Some limitations and challenges need to be addressed in the future assessment. First, since indices can increase the quantity of data needed (Saisana and Tarantola, 2002 ), like the problem faced by other assessments (e.g., Lozano et al., 2018 ; Xu et al., 2020 ), the lack of data (Table S2) became a critical challenge for the selection of indicators in this study (especially the indicators used to evaluate SDGs of means of implementation and cooperation), and it further affected the subsequent evaluation and analysis. Second, interpolating the missing data may increase the uncertainty of the final results of the index, and different interpolation methods are likely to have different effects on the final results (Huan et al., 2019 ). Thus, we used a combination of various interpolation and prediction simulation methods to fill in the missing data, trying to make the filled data close to the real situation. Third, the indicator framework we used has the limitation that some targets may not be fully measured by the selected indicators. This is because there is a lack of sufficient evaluation indicators, and even if enough indicators are selected, some of the indicators may only be replacement indicators for the indicators in the recommended indicator list developed by Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (2018) . Since this recommended indicator list also has been argued about its incompleteness (Cetrulo et al., 2020 ), those substitute indicators may be highly subjective and fuzzy choices by the researchers, and might further devalue the targets. Fourth, for most of the studies including this one, the use of direct rather than complex methods for this quantitative indicator-based assessment is still a challenge (Hogan et al., 2018 ) and it has been debated that indices might send non-robust policy messages and let policy-makers draw simplistic policy conclusions (Saisana and Tarantola, 2002 ). However, for the assessment of the progress of achieving SDGs using a large number of indicators (about 100 or more) (e.g., Clark et al., 2018 ; Huan et al., 2019 ), the methodological framework we constructed is a further attempt, which solves the problem of how to effectively and comprehensively evaluate and compare the progress of achieving SDGs at the regional level composing of multiple countries (Supplementary information). Future research may focus on three aspects: 1) the assessment and analysis of the cross-border spillover effects of sustainable development actions in a region to other regions; 2) the specific analysis of the trade-offs and synergies among the four SDGs dimensions (society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperation) of the region along the “Belt and Road”; and 3) the impact of sustainable development policies or related policies of the “Belt and Road” construction on the progress of achieving SDGs for various countries.   5 Conclusions The feasibility of the achievement of goals and targets can be perceived affects international organizations, funding agencies and countries to respond to the challenges posed by these goals. With the gradual advancement of the interaction between constructing the “Belt and Road” and accelerating the achievement of SDGs, this study successfully constructed a method for assessing regional progress of achieving SDGs, especially for the entire region along the “Belt and Road”. Notably, although the evaluation framework of this study is applicable to any other regions, a change in the indicators we used in this study may be necessary when other regions are assessed. The three indices included in the methodological framework constructed in this study can provide useful information and evidences (such as progress of achieving four dimensional SDGs (society, economy, environment, means of implementation and cooperative) and the coupling coordination degree among these four SDG dimensions) for policy circles at different stages to support regional coordinated planning and strategic national-level decision-making, and ultimately help countries for constructing the “Belt and Road” and achieving SDGs. It is hoped that this kind of regional analysis can assist to positively promote the national-level or even local-level assessment reports of the progress of achieving SDGs. The three indices in this study are not intended to replace the monitoring of individual goals or targets, but provide a mechanism by which the overall performance of different SDGs dimensions can be more easily compared.
