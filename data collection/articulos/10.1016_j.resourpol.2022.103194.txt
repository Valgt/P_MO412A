                  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic recession has been experienced by the entire world. This recession has caused the prices of natural resources to shrink due to a reduction in energy demand. This has caused the renewable energy projects to lose the interest of public and private finance participation. Moreover, these trends have led to a reduction in the competitiveness of renewable energy project projects that could have led to the achievement of sustainable development goals. The present study has investigated the causality relationship between investments in renewable energy and green finance while considering factors like economic growth electricity output of the renewable energy sector and the investment of private sectors in the energy sector development. China serves as the study's setting, and time series data from 2000 to 2020 were employed throughout the previous 21 years. The researcher has shown that IR, REO, and GF exhibit more erratic behaviour in comparison to GDP and IEP in the chosen period using the new technique of the wavelet power spectrum. Additionally, the coherence wavelet technique has shown that there is a unidirectional causal link from GDP to IR and IR to GF as well as a bidirectional substantial correlation between IR and our REO. In both long and short-run analyses, different kinds of causal relationships have been found. However, IEP did not show any link with IR. Based on the empirical findings in the current study the researcher recommends that the Chinese government should design specific policies to deal with the volatility in IR, GF, REO while also looking to enhance investments in these sectors to achieve sustainable growth, environmental sustainability, and increased investments in renewable energy projects for the production of increased renewable energy in China.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic recession has been experienced by the entire world. This recession has caused the prices of natural resources to shrink due to a reduction in energy demand. This has caused the renewable energy projects to lose the interest of public and private finance participation. Moreover, these trends have led to a reduction in the competitiveness of renewable energy project projects that could have led to the achievement of sustainable development goals. The present study has investigated the causality relationship between investments in renewable energy and green finance while considering factors like economic growth electricity output of the renewable energy sector and the investment of private sectors in the energy sector development. China serves as the study's setting, and time series data from 2000 to 2020 were employed throughout the previous 21 years. The researcher has shown that IR, REO, and GF exhibit more erratic behaviour in comparison to GDP and IEP in the chosen period using the new technique of the wavelet power spectrum. Additionally, the coherence wavelet technique has shown that there is a unidirectional causal link from GDP to IR and IR to GF as well as a bidirectional substantial correlation between IR and our REO. In both long and short-run analyses, different kinds of causal relationships have been found. However, IEP did not show any link with IR. Based on the empirical findings in the current study the researcher recommends that the Chinese government should design specific policies to deal with the volatility in IR, GF, REO while also looking to enhance investments in these sectors to achieve sustainable growth, environmental sustainability, and increased investments in renewable energy projects for the production of increased renewable energy in China.

The outbreak of the significantly contagious virus and disease based COVID-19 pandemic, which did not only impacted various lives but also disturbed and disrupted various organizations and businesses all around the world, including China as well (Kirikkaleli and Adebayo, 2021 ; Mehmood, 2021 ). Not only this virus and pandemic has impacted the business environment but it has also significantly brought up a challenge against the infrastructure of renewable energy (Kirikkaleli and Adebayo, 2021 ; Mehmood, 2021 ). Anyhow, the renewable energy consumption in China as a percentage of the total final energy consumption has been provided in the figure below. Traditional non-renewable energy sources, such as fossil fuels, are used to create both electricity and heat in China. However, it has been shown that all of these energy carriers have reduced levels of efficiency due to heat loss. (Mehmood, 2021 ; Nawaz et al., 2021 ). Anyhow, significantly high level of variable renewable energy sources share significantly and adversely impact reliability and flexibility of power system in China (Sachs et al., 2019b ). Moreover, the recent recession and pandemic has significantly impacted the competitiveness of the global market as well, having drastic impacts on the investments in green projects globally and in China as well, which can also result in the enhancement of dangers and threats to various climate related goals all around the world (Mehmood, 2021 ; Nawaz et al., 2021 ). For the purpose of addressing this problem, the financial system of China is holding deterministic importance and value, in order to account regarding the green financial investments that can assist in the achievement of sustainable environmental and economic growth of China (Sachs et al., 2019b ). According to various authors, sustainable financial system is only the one that manages and generates the financial assets in a significant way in order to provide benefit to the economy and the people as well, along with the betterment of the environment, rather than only focusing on the privileged individuals (Shen et al., 2021 ). However, the term “green finance” is used to describe financial instruments that involve climate finance. However, this term is not limited to these financial instruments; it can also refer to environmental goals such as eco-friendly investments, eco-friendly financial systems, the promotion of sustainability, and movements that involve green bonds, green loans, and green mortgages. (Shen et al., 2021 ; Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino, 2020 ). In order to significantly enhance the level of environmentally friendly investments in China, the analysis regarding green finance and clean energy impacts in the context of China is very important (Yoshino et al., 2021 ). Which is why, the current study has the following objectives to fulfil through this research.• To find out the impact of green finance (GFI) on environmentally friendly investment (IRE).  • To find out the impact of clean energy (REEO) on environmentally friendly investment (IRE).  • To assess the impact of the control variables, Gross domestic product (GDP) and Commitment to energy infrastructure projects (IEPP), in the case of the relationship among green finance, clean energy and environmentally friendly investment.    The study is possessing significance to address the problems involving the lack of funding, which is serving various obstacles and hurdles for the growth of the renewable energy in China, after the year 2018, most of the global energy investment was directed towards the carbon emitting energy sources, involving the resources of oil and coal (Yoshino et al., 2021 ; Zafar et al., 2021 ). For example, when it comes to power production, renewable energy has gotten around 39% of the investments, although the whole energy industry has only received about 19% of the investments. (Anser et al., 2020 ). In comparison with that, the fossil fuels have been receiving only 60% of the total investments, while all of the other investments are directed towards battery storage nuclear storage biofuels storage and other resources, which can directly be considered as the sources of the greenhouse gases emissions all around the world (Kirikkaleli and Adebayo, 2021 ; Mehmood, 2021 ). Continuous investments directed towards the energy efficiency, renewable energy and green initiatives dramatically decreased in the years 2019 and 2020, due to the outbreak of the pandemic of COVID-19 all around the world, and the patterns can be observed in the case of China as well (Barbier and Burgess, 2020 ). The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant economic downturns in China, resulting in significant drop in the prices of gas and oil as well, the lower prices of the fossil fuels can be observed to be detrimental for the development of the projects based on renewable energy like power sources, solar sources and the wind sources (Kirikkaleli and Adebayo, 2021 ; Mehmood, 2021 ). As a consequence, investors are less interested in making investments in renewable energy sources or technologies, which jeopardises China's efforts to achieve sustainable development objectives. (Nawaz et al., 2021 ). So, in order to address all of these diversified problems related with the environmentally friendly investments, clean energy and green finance, this study is contributing significantly under the influence of the control variables of gross domestic product and the commitment to energy infrastructure projects (Sachs et al., 2019b ). This paper has covered the portion of introduction, involving the background of the study, the problem statement of the study, the justifications and rationale for selecting this topic, the objectives of the study and the significance of the study (Duan and Wang, 2021 ). Rest of the paper is set in the order that, the second portion consists of literature review, the third portion contains the research methodology, the fourth portion covers the data analysis, findings and interpretation and the fifth portion contains the discussion and conclusion of the results and study (Ma et al., 2021 ).  2 Literature review 2.1 Sustainable development goals and environmentally friendly investments The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are targets to achieve the desirable and ideal world. They include targets for all nations to end poverty, end hunger, focus on good health and wellbeing, improve conditions for clean water and sanitation, make clean energy more accessible, improve gender equality, improve conditions for clean water and sanitation, improve conditions for good jobs and economic growth, and improve industry innovation and infrastructure while improving. (Ahmad and Tahar, 2014 ; Amegah and Jaakkola, 2016 ; Anser et al., 2020 ). These goals have objectives towards reducing inequalities, increasing responsible consumption and production, positive climate actions, enhancement of the quality of life on land, enhancement of the quality of life below land, increasing peace, justice and strong institutions, along with enhancing the partnerships for achievement of these goals (Bank, 2012 ; Barbier and Burgess, 2020 ; Ilić et al., 2019 ). This study significantly focuses on the sustainable development goals of affordable and clean energy, enhanced quality of the life on land, and sustainable cities and communities. As the focus of the study is on the enhancement of environmentally friendly investments, green finance and clean energy, so, the study significantly contributes towards the ideas that can promote the sustainable development goals of creation of affordable and clean energy, enhanced quality of life on the land in China and sustainable cities and communities in China as well (Ilić et al., 2019 ; Ji and Zhang, 2019 ; Kirikkaleli and Adebayo, 2021 ). The sustainable development goals also require various triggers in order to consistently fulfil all of the objectives, that can ensure a safer and better future, first of all, the implementation of the environmentally friendly investments in China can directly lead towards utilization of renewable energy resources, which automatically decreases the level of adverse impacts on the environment and the life on land (Kirikkaleli and Adebayo, 2021 ; Kousksou et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, utilizing the renewable energy resources results in the reduction of the utilization and application of non-renewable energy resources, resulting in clean environment, effective methods to make conscious decisions during business deals and minimizing the adverse impacts on the environment as much as possible (Kousksou et al., 2015 ; McCollum et al., 2018 ). The study also places a lot of emphasis on green finance, which has the potential to contribute to the growth and development of Chinese cities and communities in the most environmentally friendly manner, having a significant and favourable impact on environmentally friendly investments as well as the environment. (Mehmood, 2021 ; Nawaz et al., 2021 ). The projects and developmental steps that are taken in accordance with the environmentally friendly practices, are going to directly result in the enhancement of the environmentally friendly investments and application of green finance as well, resulting in sustainable cities and communities, which positively contribute towards the environment (Mehmood, 2021 ; Nawaz et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, these steps directly and positively also impact the quality of life in China as well (Zhou, 2021 ). The promotion of green finance and the enhancement of the environmentally friendly investments not only enhance the level of green practices and green projects in China but will also enhance the quality of life on the land in China as a result of utilization and application of clean energy (Nawaz et al., 2021 ; Nerini et al., 2019 ). As a consequence, these actions will lead to a considerable amount of commitment to energy infrastructure projects that are more sustainable, which will have a big and good influence on China's gross domestic product as well as its environment. (Nerini et al., 2018 ).  2.2 Impact of green finance (GFI) on environmentally friendly investment (IRE) As far as the green finance is concerned, the literature regarding this concept is very extensive even before the pandemic of COVID-19 as well, however, after the break out of the pandemic of COVID-19, it was observed that the discussion of the concept in the literature becomes significantly low (Oyedepo, 2012 , 2014 ). Only some of the studies from reputable journals have taken up analysis of the impacts of green finance on various environmental factors, some of the studies have taken up the discussion on green finance in relationship with various energy related, economic and environmental variables (Sachs et al., 2019a , 2019b ). However, a study has analyzed the impact of green finance in the case of green investments while analysing the sustainable growth and the CO2 emissions based on the production in China, for the years ranging from 1998 to the year 2017 (Schroeder et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, this study has applied autoregressive distributed lags cointegration approach and has presented with the fact that CO2 emissions based on the production and the determinants related to it can be observed to be cointegrated for the long term (Schroeder et al., 2019 ). Besides that, the outcomes present with the idea that renewable energy and green investments significantly and adversely impact the CO2 emissions based on the production, which means that these can be decreased with the help of the use of renewable energy and green investments or finance as well (Schroeder et al., 2019 ; Schwerhoff and Sy, 2017 ). So, it can be presented as a clear fact that there is a significant role of the green investment or finance and the renewable energy utilization for the purpose of the achievement of the goal of minimizing CO2 emissions as a result of production (Sen and Ganguly, 2017 ; Shen et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, it has also been observed by another study that the impact of green investment or finance on the level of sustainable growth is significant and positive which means that more the green finance or investment more will be the sustainable growth of a country (Sen and Ganguly, 2017 ; Shen et al., 2021 ). However, during the pandemic of COVID-19, this relationship has suffered as well along with adverse impacts on the green investments and sustainable growth individually as well. So, further studies are being conducted by researchers in order to analyze the impact of green finance on the sustainability and sustainable growth, as, the more that this concept is studied, the significant will be the enhancement in environmentally friendly investments and projects (Yoshino et al., 2021 ; Zafar et al., 2021 ). This fact represents with the proposal that there is a positive and significant impact of the green finance on both the sustainable growth and the enhancement of the environmentally friendly investments in the world. Another study has analyzed the adverse impacts of the pandemic of COVID-19 on the sustainable growth and has proposed that for the purpose of achieving sustainable environmental goals, there is a significant requirement of healthy environmental policies that implement environmentally friendly projects, carbon free development methodologies and green finance (Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino, 2019 , 2020 ). Again, representing with the idea that there is a positive and significant relationship present between green finance and the environmentally friendly investment. However, there is yet a gap in the previous literature regarding the direct analysis of various determinants of green finance in relationship with the environmentally friendly investments (Srikanth, 2018 ; Steckel and Jakob, 2018 ). However, on the basis of the current relevant literature and the discussion done regarding the review of literature of the previous relevant studies, the following statement is hypothesized.H1 Impact of green finance (GFI) on environmentally friendly investment (IRE) is significant.    2.3 Impact of clean energy (REEO) on environmentally friendly investment (IRE) In regards with the global clean energy, a significant shift has been observed in the adoption of the global clean energy during the pandemic of COVID-19, studies are arguing that as a result of the outbreak of the contagious pandemic, significant decline can be observed in the demand of the energy, which has reduced the energy prices, along with the slowing down of the renewable energy projects progress as far as the distribution is concerned (Steckel and Jakob, 2018 ; Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino, 2019 ). Anyhow, most of the authors have arguments that this presents with a significant opportunity to adopt the renewable energy resources further enhancement of clean energy usage and investments, majorly in the sectors that are heavily dependent upon non-renewable energy resources (Taghizadeh-Hesary and Yoshino, 2020 ). In accordance with this argument, most of the studies and authors have made the case that there is a significant influence of the enhancement of the clean energy adoption and utilization on the environmentally friendly investments as well (Volz, 2018 ; Yoshino et al., 2021 ; Zafar et al., 2021 ). Authors are discussing significant influence of the pandemic of COVID-19 on the market of global energy, resulting in adoption and implementation of strategies that result in the increase in the adoption of sustainable energies. In accordance with another study, evidence can be observed that as a result of green finance-based projects, there can be an enhancement in the environmentally friendly investments, thus, resulting in enhanced clean energy as well (Volz, 2018 ; Yoshino et al., 2021 ; Zafar et al., 2021 ). These factors have been observed to be enhancing sustainable growth respectively as well, green economic growth and the green finance can directly and positively trigger environmentally friendly investments, thus positively enhancing the green and clean energy as well (Yoshino et al., 2021 ; Zafar et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, the adoption of clean energy options and the application of renewable energy resources is also anticipated to lead towards the enhancement of the environmentally friendly investments (Barbier and Burgess, 2020 ; Ilić et al., 2019 ). Anyhow, the researcher has observed various gaps and shortcomings as well, as it can be observed that the studies prior to COVID-19 have scarcely considered the concept of green finance, and also lack in the establishment of a relationship between the green finance and clean energy, in relationship with green investments (Barbier and Burgess, 2020 ; Ilić et al., 2019 ). Moreover, there at least studies in the past that have directly considered the impact of clean energy on the environmentally friendly investments, let alone establishing a relationship between green finance and clean energy adoption (Nerini et al., 2018 , 2019 ). So, the study has the objective to overcome these gaps and shortcomings from the previous studies, by analysing the direct impact of clean energy on the environmentally friendly investments. Thus, on the basis of the discussion above, the following hypothesis is proposed:H2 Impact of Clean energy (REEO) on environmentally friendly investment (IRE) is significant.     3 Methodology 3.1 Theoretical framework and model specification Based on the past literature and the research objectives of the current study it is observed that the recent COVID-19 pandemic led to disruption in the global economy and financial activities across the world. As China was the first to be hit by this pandemic, the economy and the market activities in China have been affected the most (Huang and Chen, 2021 ; Ikram et al., 2021 ; Muganyi et al., 2021 ). Moreover, China is also credited as the biggest producer of carbon dioxide in the world while still being ahead in the focus on environmental sustainability research and practice (Li et al., 2021 ). Therefore, it is vital to observe the investment of China in green finance and its impact on the renewable energy sector of China. Five variables have been used in this study in totality namely; green finance (GF), investment in renewable energy (IR), renewable electric output (REO), investment in energy with private participation (IEP), and economic growth (GDP). GF is treated in terms of a function of IR, presented in model 1 below:(1) IR = f(GF) …    GF can be considered as an important deciding factor for IR because all across the world the renewable energy projects are being financed by the use of green financing and is believed to hold innovation potential which is why most countries are aiming to make the green finance market strong (Ikram et al., 2021 ; Muganyi et al., 2021 ; Shahzad et al., 2021 ). Hence, in light of these indications and of the past literature, it can be assumed that a positive association exists between green finance and renewable energy investment. Moreover, economic performance is also a decisive factor for investments in the renewable energy sector as an investment in this sector leads to tackling environmental pollution that indirectly contributes to the economic growth of a country (Shahzad et al., 2022 ; Song et al., 2021 ; W. Zhang et al., 2021 )Thus, IR and GDP model could be specified as:(2) IR = f(GDP) …    In addition to GF and GDP, IR can also be linked to REO and IEP. Renewable electricity is the major source of renewable energy in the world indicating the presence of a bidirectional relation between renewable electricity and the economic growth of a country (Azam et al., 2021 ; Oikonomou et al., 2021 ). IR can therefore be linked to REO as:(3) IR = f(REO) …    Moreover, in a country like China private investors can control the investments in the energy sector, linking IEP and IR as:(4) IR = f(IEP) …    The researcher has taken data for the variables included in this study from various resources as listed in Table 1   below. Moreover, the data is taken from 1990 to 2020.  3.2 Wavelet power spectrum and wavelet coherence In this study, the researcher has used the wavelet analysis technique which is a time series-based analysis approach. In this analysis, the data is split into components of frequency and each component is estimated according to the scaled resolution. Therefore, to examine the time-frequency dependency of IR on the exogenous variables in this study this diverse technique has been used (Goupillaud et al., 1984 ). Several soldiers have recently used the wavelet power spectrum and wavelength coherence methodologies two examine the impact of COVID-19 on various market sectors like tourism, environment, etc. (Li et al., 2021 ; Pandey et al., 2021 ; Sun and Wang, 2021 ; Yan et al., 2021 ). This approach has been identified as unique as it combines the time domain and frequency domain causalities in a single analysis. Therefore, it is a novel approach that allows the researcher to identify both the long-run and the short-run causality relationships between IR and the exogenous variables of the study. To examine the Nexus between IR and the other variables in this study the researcher has adopted the wavelet approach based on the Morlet family wavelet technique (Ikram et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 2021 ) that can be rendered by the following equation.(5) ψ ( t )  = π 1 / 4   e i w 0  t   e − r  2  2       where t represents time frames from 1 to T. To analyze the crucial wavelet fluctuation and frequency fluctuation in the wavelet described in the above equation the following transformation equation is used:(6) ψ k , f   ( t )  = h − 1 / 2   ψ ( t − k  f  )  , k , f  €  R , f ≠ 0      The above equation can lead to continuous wavelet forms of the wavelet in the terms of k  and f  making the data a time-series data set represented below:(7) W p  ( k , f  )  = ∫ − ∞  ∞  p ( t )  f − 1 / 2   ψ ( ( ( t − k  )   ̅  )    f  d t      While the above equation represents the time series, the following equation will represent the corresponding coefficient of the wavelets:(7a) P ( t )  = 1 C ψ    [  | W p  ( a , b  )  2   |  d a  ]  d b  b 2        Furthermore, it is important to use the wavelet power spectrum in this study as it will indicate the amplitude of the variables in the time series and can be represented as per the following equation:W P S  p  ( k , f  )  = | W p  ( k , f  )   |  2   ( 8 )      Wavelet coherence techniques are also used in this study to provide benefits over traditional correlations in past research this method allows a better representation of both the time series and time-domain data and the conversion of the wavelet time series can be provided as presented below:(9) W p q   ( k , f  )  = W p    ( k , f  )  W q    ( k , f  )   ‾       The above-mentioned equation includes both the time series and time-domain data. The squared version of the wavelet coherence can be constructed as per the instructions of ref  given below:(10) R 2  ( k , f  )  = | C ( 1 f  W p q   ( k , f  )   )   |  2  | C ( 1 f  W p  ( k , f  )   )   |  2  | C ( 1 f  W q  ( k , f  )   )   |  2         In the above equation, C represents the time and smoothing process. The differentiation on the wavelet coherence is presented by the following equation:(11) ψ p q   ( k , f  )  = tan − 1   ( L { C ( f − 1   W p q   ( k , f  )   )   }   O { C ( f − 1   W p q   ( k , f  )   )   }    )       In the above equation, L and O represent the lag of operators. Finally, for easier interpretation of the wave wavelet coherence in this study, it should be mentioned that the horizontal axis is a representation of the time dimension and the vertical axis is a representation of the frequency dimension. Moreover, the higher scale is a representation of a lower frequency. In the time-frequency sections, the wavelet coherence is used as an identification for the covariance between the two-time series taken in the study. Moreover, the stronger colouring represents a stronger relationship whereas the blue colouring represents a weak or no relationship in the series. The lag and lead phases are depicted by arrows in the graphical displays. Co-movement is shown by zero phase difference areas. The movement of arrows in the same direction means the time series are in phase and the movement in opposing directions means it is an anti-phase (Li et al., 2021 ).   4 Results 4.1 Descriptive statistics The descriptive evaluation aids the researcher in preparing a summary for the variables under evaluation. The present study uses the general numeric forms of the variables to evaluate the mean, standard deviation and the normality of the variables. The normality for the present study is estimated through the measures of skewness, kurtosis and Jarque-Bera test. The outcomes of these tests can be seen in Table 2  . The mean value for each of the measures has been accounted for and is reportedly 3.59 for investment in renewable energy resources, 4.13 for green finance, 4.81 for gross domestic product, 18.87 for clean energy depicted through REEO and 2.14 for IEPP which demonstrates the commitment for the green infrastructure projects. The values of the median indicate of low difference with that of the mean values. Although the range i.e., the maximum and minimum values demonstrate of significant changes in the values that are the cause behind the higher standard deviation values. Thus, the standard deviation values for each of the indicator are showcased as 3.5 for IRE, 2.69 for GF, 2.53 for GDP, 3.69 for REEO and 2.49 for IEPP. Also, three different tests were used for the normality evaluation of the dataset. The results show that the variables were normal from the perspective of the skewness and kurtosis tests, as the found values were within the threshold limits of these tests. Moreover, the Jarque-Bera test was also used for the evaluation of normality. The Jarque-Bera test indicates that all variables but the IEPP were found to be normal.  4.2 Results of the wavelet power spectrum The wavelet power spectrum demonstrates the results of the volatility in the renewable energy investments, clean energy and the green finance. In reference to Fig. 1  , the power spectrum is demonstrating the results of the power spectrum for the volatility in the investments in the renewable resources for the period between 1990 and 2020. Conversely the highest volatility in this factor is noticeable between only two periods. The highest indication of the volatility can be viewed in the period between 2002 and 2006 and also from 2009 to 2014. The second period is in current due to the presence of the global financial crisis. Between the first period the increase in the energy resources led the Chinese government to invest more in the resources for renewable energy, thus minimizing the dependency for the consumption of the fossil fuels. The increases in the energy and oil demands led to increases in the prices for the commodities, thus triggering more volatility in the investments for the renewable energy (Stevenson, 2017 ). Moreover, the financial crises of 2007–2009 produced more uncertainty in the prices of the fuels worldwide and thus resultantly there was a hike in the prices in Chinese resources as well. Thus, the increased uncertainty and the imminent crises and price uncertainties in the fuel prices have led to the increase in investment in the renewable energy resources. Thus, more volatility and fluctuations can be observed in the values for the investment in the renewable energy resources. Also, no other period of serene volatility can be observed in the figure besides those mentioned, as observed through the blue regions of the figure. By referring to Figs. 2 and 3    none of the figures inform of the extended period of volatility in either of the economic growth (GDP) and the investments in clean energy. Also, Fig. 3  captures the volatility of the private investments in the renewable energy which is a reference for the clean energy investments. Fig. 4   demonstrates the power spectrum for green finance for the period of 1990–2020 for China. The occurrence of volatility can be observed for the period between 1995 and 2001 and the second occurrence, although of lesser magnitude, is between 2005 and 2009. These occurrences are in line with the price hikes of the global energy commodities between the same period. Thus, the green finance increases in response to the shocks from the crisis's periods. The usage of green finance is imminent in resolving the environmental problems and developing a path to sustainable economic performance at the same time (Falcone, 2020 ; D. Zhang et al., 2021 ). Fig. 5   is representing the power spectrum for REEO or the clean energy. The clean energy is represented through the renewable electricity as a percentage of the output of the total electricity. The volatility in the fifth figure can be captured from the period between 1998 and 2008 and also then again post 2019. These increases and volatility is associated with numerous global economic incidences, the outbreak of the covid pandemic, the increase in the global prices for oil and the global financial crises. All of these incidents ultimately enhanced the development and production of the renewable energy electricity in China.  4.3 Wavelet coherence results There are positive associations represented by the arrows pointing to the right and the negative associations are demonstrated through the arrows pointing to the left in the following images. Also, the arrows moving in the upward, right or left-down position are indicative of the impact of the first or the controlled indicator and the arrows pointing towards the downward direction, left-up, right down are depictive of the substantial influence of the first variable on the second factor or variable. The next two graphs are indicating the main associations between the factors i.e., the relations between the investment in renewable energy and the investment in renewable energy resources and green finance. The association between the investment in renewable energy and clean energy is depicted in Fig. 6  . The figure shows that the causation or the causal association present between the factors exists only for two specified periods. First of all, the arrows are pointing towards the right-up direction for the period between 2004 and 2009, which shows that clean energy significantly influences and causes the investment in renewable energy at the 5% level of significance. Whereas the second period of significance lies between the period of 2013–2014. The arrow heads are pointing in the right-down direction, which is showing that the variations in the investment in the renewable energy is causing the clean energy investment and efforts. Thus, there is presence of bidirectional causality between the time periods and the factors. The causal association between the investment in the renewable energy resources and the green finance has been identified through the application of the wavelet coherence method as visible in Fig. 7    . This association demonstrated through the presence of causality between two periods in the long and short run. First of all, the arrows pointing towards left-up show presence of causality for a significantly longer period in comparison to the other factors considered. The figure shows that from 1990 to 2009, there is unidirectional causality present between the IRE and green finance. Whereas the second period is between 2009 and 2014. This again indicates of the presence of the unidirectional causality between the green finance and renewable energy investments. Thus, any changes in policies relating to the green finance would have a significant impact on the investment in the renewable energy within China. Thus, consequently, changes in polices relating to the investment in renewable energy resources would impact the green finance. Also, the frequency of the causation of the second period is found to be more significant than that of the first one. Thus, the green finance policies and projects hold considerable importance for the investments in the renewable energy (see Fig. 9 ) (see Fig. 8 ).   5 Discussion and conclusion 5.1 Discussion The main focus of this research study was to determine the impact of GFI on IRE. For this research study, the wavelet analysis method was conducted. The wavelets observed showed different colours waves representing different results. Thus, the effect's cone is observed by a narrow curve i.e., found to be black in colour. The power of wavelet was considered to be terminated below this. However, the power spectrum of the wavelet was found to be thick black lines. At 5% of the level where it was discovered to be more significant, these were measured using Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicated that two time periods, 2002–2006 and 2009–2014, had the greatest IRE volatility rates. Oil and energy costs rose up with the demand, from $60 in 2005 to $147.30 in 2016. (2008). The pricing of fossil fuels were unpredictable from 2007 to 2009 because of the global financial crisis. As a result, the IRE variable displayed more volatility and variations. However, the findings indicated that the generation of renewable power had the greatest level of fluctuation. This is due to the increasing demand of the oil which resulted in increased prices of the resources. As the prices of the energy resources keep on increasing, the investments in the sectors of the renewable energy sectors also increased. This ultimately increased the enhancement of the renewable energy resources in China. Thus, no GDP volatility and the investments in the sectors of renewable energy was observed by the private investors. No GDP volatility was determined by the colder area in the figure. It has also been observed that the green finance volatility occurred from 1990 to 2020 in China. However, its rate was higher between 1995 and 2001. The yellow in the figure showed that the lesser volatility that was observed. Thus, it was observed that the green finance increased in both shock as well as crisis periods. Both long as well as short term links are captured between IRE and the variables of interest under this methodology. This method was found to work better when the data is non-stationary or noisy i.e., different volatilities as well as breakdowns in structures were observed. The warm colours (such as red) (Kirikkaleli and Kalmaz, 2020 ) shows the dependency of the variables on one another significantly while the cooler colours (such as blue) did not show any such dependency. The right direction arrows show the positive correlations while the left direction arrows show negative correlation. The causal association of bidirectional nature is observed by the down pointing arrows. Thus, this approach was used to determine the causal association between variables (which are: IRE and the GDP). This association showed that the changes in GDP also lead to changes in IRE. However, this association was found have a low significant impact for a short period of time (from 2000 to 2003) (Alam and Muran (2020). The blue green colour in the figure showed less significant causal association between the IRE and IEPP. The causality of unidirectional nature was observed from the IRE towards the GF observed during the period of 2009–2014. The green finance was also found to be affected by any change in the policy of IRE in China (Kaftan and Ahmed, 2021 ; Nawaz et al., 2021 ). It has also been observed that green finance has an impact on the development of new energy resources. The results obtained showed that some variables have unidirectional causal association with IRE while the other shows bidirectional causal association with IRE.  5.2 Conclusion From this research study it has been observed that even though extensive literature review was available for different indicators related to financial, energy and as well as for economy. But the causal relationship between such variables has not much been studied. This study helped in determining the causal relationship between IRE and other variables such as GF and GDP. The data for this study was obtained from the time period (1999–2020). This research investigation used the wavelet coherence technique. According to the findings, the IRE fluctuated between 2003 and 2007 and from 2009 to 2013. While other variables, including GF and REEO, exhibited volatility across several periods. Both unidirectional and bidirectional causal correlations between several variables were identified in this investigation. The causal link between IRE and GF was shown to be unidirectional in both the short- and long-term. Thus, it was concluded that IRE has an important impact on GF and is considered to be an important variable in this case. The outcomes of both volatility as well as causality are thus discussed in this research study to obtain a better understanding of the relationships between IRE and other variables in China especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, this research study also helped in determining a better model that could be used for obtaining the causal relationships between different variables.  5.3 Implications Implicating policies practically to obtain attention instantly is considered to be very important. Thus, the volatilities observed among these variables should be controlled by designing better policies. For this purpose, the budget should be fixed and proper check and balance should be done. As it has been observed that the investment in renewable energy plays an important role in the green finance so, such policies should be designed that helps in the enhancement of renewable energy that could help in contributing towards other factors for a sustainable environment. This encourages the development of novel policies that may be used to expand the usage of renewable power sources in place of fossil fuels. Therefore, improving green finance should be taken into account while formulating policies in order to have greater renewable energy production and investment. However, it is believed that if such measures are taken, it could prevent uncertainties in different areas such as economic, financial as well as environmental.  5.4 Limitations and future indications Very few past studies were conducted in the past on the causal relationship between IRE and GF and other such variables. So, little literature review was obtained for this research study and a lot of variables have to be re-considered. This research study only focused on the economy and environment aspects of China. However, for future studies, the study should be extended to other countries also considering their environmental as well as economic conditions. For this study, only two variables were taken into consideration for this research study which are: IRE and GF. However, for future studies, other variables apart from IRE and GF should also be included to have a clear picture of the volatilities and causal relationships among different variables that could be found to have an impact on the energy renewable electricity as well investment of the renewable energy (for this purpose natural resources should be considered instead of fossil fuel). In this research study, a defined time period was used for determining the volatilities among the variables including only the private investors during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, for future studies, the energy prices before as well as after the Covid-19 should be taken into count to have a clear picture of the impact of the incident on the energy renewable resources.
