                  In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were announced with the agreement of 190 world leaders aiming for ending extreme poverty, fighting inequality and injustice by 2030. Among different approaches, investments in future generations’ capacities to thrive are key to attaining these goals. Promoting children’s thriving, however, is not a simple matter because child development is not a single state and is not determined by a single force. Promoting children’s development and capacities necessitates a multifaceted approach, and place-based interventions stand out as a promising strategy. This paper reviewed current evidence on the outcomes of place-based interventions aimed at improving children’s capacities to thrive. We found that 22 published texts that met our inclusion criteria, exhibiting a range of program effects. The review also highlighted several challenges related to implementation and evaluation. Additionally, we discussed how place-based interventions adapt in the digital age.

In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were announced with the agreement of 190 world leaders aiming for ending extreme poverty, fighting inequality and injustice by 2030. Among different approaches, investments in future generations’ capacities to thrive are key to attaining these goals. Promoting children’s thriving, however, is not a simple matter because child development is not a single state and is not determined by a single force. Promoting children’s development and capacities necessitates a multifaceted approach, and place-based interventions stand out as a promising strategy. This paper reviewed current evidence on the outcomes of place-based interventions aimed at improving children’s capacities to thrive. We found that 22 published texts that met our inclusion criteria, exhibiting a range of program effects. The review also highlighted several challenges related to implementation and evaluation. Additionally, we discussed how place-based interventions adapt in the digital age.

Those changes include political crises, climate change, poverty, indigenous disadvantage, child abuse, family violence, obesity, and natural resource management (McCoy, 2017 ). Some of these problems such as child abuse and poverty are not new but have come to the forefront as we have become aware of their detrimental consequences for development and the complexity of their causes. Others such as obesity and climate change, however, are fairly recent phenomena that have resulted from a combination of social factors (McCoy, 2017 ). These changes while impacting all children and families, have significantly largest effects on those living on the marginal of societies, impacting all aspects of their development, health and wellbeing pushing those that have already been disadvantaged further into poverty (Moore et al., 2015 ). Over the past two decades, numerous programs (government and non-government) were funded across the world in a collective effort to address these “wicked issues” (Moore & Skinner, 2010 ). Many programs however tended to rely upon single component − that address the presenting problems, rather than looking at the systemic (ecological) conditions that lead to the problems in the first place. These traditional ways of organising and delivering services that rely on solo performance have been criticized to be insufficient to address these complex problems faced by the more disadvantaged families. It is mainly due to the fact that most of the wicked problems are deeply rooted and intertwined within the social-political system; making solo effort insufficient (Health, 2010; Moore et al., 2015 ). One of the rallying cries for social services in recent years thus has been the notion of ‘joined up solutions for joined up problems’ (Carey et al., 2014; Keast, 2011 ). Among the current approaches, PBIs (place-based interventions) are becoming increasingly popular as one of the most promising approaches. PBIs are programs designed to tackle the collective problems of families and communities at a local level. PBIs are delivered with the intention of tackling complex social problems within areas or communities with structural disadvantages (Wiseman, 2006 ). Issues that PBIs aim to address, which strongly align with the SDGs include health, education, child development, family wellbeing, community strengthening, housing, urban regeneration, liveability, crime, employment, economic development, immigrant and Indigenous communities, social inclusion, and exclusion. This approach is considered promising, first because it directly addresses the collective problem by bringing different stakeholders of children's lives (families, schools, communities, local government) into the agenda, considering them as the drivers of change. Second, this model places “place” at the centre of the intervention believing that comprehensive interventions should not ignore the local social context (neighbourhood, region, or ecosystem) surrounding families (Bellefontaine & Wisener, 2019). It is imperative to note that place-based approaches do not contain a single method, but rather a collective of strategies put together depending on the families and local circumstances. Griggs et al. (2008) classified PBIs into five categories: (Type 1) PBIs focus on place to impact place, (Type 2) PBIs focus on person to impact person, (Type 3) PBIs focus on person to impact place, (Type 4) PBIs focus on place to impact person, and (Type 5) PBIs focus on both place and person to impact both. The first two types of PBIs are often contrasted. 'Place to impact place' initiatives aim to improve the physical and social services provided to families. In contrast, the person-to-person approach primarily focuses on direct assistance to individuals or families. PBIs that focus on place or people to impact the other have demonstrated some effectiveness, but programs have proven to work best when combined (Type 5) (Griggs et al., 2008). In recent years, both government and non-government organizations have continued to invest in PBIs due to their potential benefits (Edwards et al., 2011; Katz, 2009; Wilks et al., 2015 ). As this investment continues, it is crucial to understand the benefits and impact PBIs have had on their target population, particularly children. The effectiveness of PBIs on children's early development has been documented in existing literature (Wilks et al., 2015 ) (Burgemeister et al., 2021; Crew, 2020; Glover et al., 2021; Moore & Fry, 2011; Wilks et al., 2015 ). For instance, current PBIs have successfully improved children's outcomes across various aspects of primary health, including immunization, physical health, dental care, and injury prevention (Glover et al., 2021 ). Moreover, PBIs have also achieved success in enhancing pregnancy and infant care quality, as well as improving outcomes for children, families, and communities across different domains (Burgemeister et al., 2021; Crew, 2020; Wilks et al., 2015 ). However, there are many aspects of PBIs that require further exploration. Firstly, the outcomes of PBIs have been mixed, with some programs demonstrating significant impacts while others have not. This raises important questions about the variability in program outcomes and the factors that might help or hinder the effectiveness of PBIs. Secondly, most of these studies focus on the early years (0–6) and provide evidence of initiatives that address a wide variety of primary health indicators such as immunization rates, reduction in injuries, reduction in hospital admissions to pregnancy care. While primary health outcomes are undeniably important, achieving the SDGs, as emphasized by Clark et al. (2020) , requires more than merely ensuring children's survival; it necessitates enabling them to thrive. This involves providing comprehensive care that supports children's holistic development, including good nutrition and attentive caregiving, to foster robust health and overall well-being. Additionally, thriving entails providing opportunities for intellectual and emotional development, including cognitive growth, school readiness, emotional well-being, a strong sense of self-identity, self-worth, and the capacity to connect with others. Current reviews of PBIs on young children have either neglected these perspectives of children's outcomes (Glover et al., 2021 ) or have conflated them with primary health outcomes (Burgemeister et al., 2021 ). This blending of outcome reports complicates the assessment of PBIs' effectiveness across distinct domains of children's development. By separating and clearly defining these outcomes, we can better understand the specific impacts of PBIs on various aspects of child development. In this paper, we present a scoping review of integrated PBIs aimed specifically at promoting children's capacities to thrive. This review has two primary objectives: first, to examine current evidence regarding initiatives designed to enhance children's capacities to thrive. This includes synthesizing of outcomes, analysing the geographical locations of these programs, the populations they serve, the types of services provided, and the specific outcomes they target. Second, the review aims to identify key factors that contribute to the success or failure of these programs and to propose future directions for maximizing the impact of PBIs on children. Our review focuses on children aged 0 to 12. This age range was chosen because, while the early years are crucial, children's social and emotional capacities that equip them to thrive continue to develop throughout middle and late childhood. It is thus important to understand how current supports assist children's development across this broader span of childhood. By investigating the full spectrum of childhood, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how PBIs are currently supporting children's growth and to identify areas where further support is needed to ensure children can reach their full potential. The effectiveness of PBI on children’s thriving indicators will be synthesized. Our primary aim, however, is not to assess the current effectiveness of PBIs but to consolidate the existing body of evidence from various studies to understand the current evaluation quality. This synthesis will offer valuable insights into how these programs support children's development during this critical stage of life.  2 Method 2.1 Search protocol, extraction, and analysis This review followed a systematised process guided by (Johnson & Hennessy, 2019 ). A search of seven international databases including (CINAHL, Education Database, PsycInfo/APA PsycNet, Science Direct, Scopus, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science) was conducted in November 2021 using combined search strings including: 1. Child, children, young people, parent, family; AND Place-based/level, area-based/level, community-based/level, neighbourhood-based/level, collective impact; AND 4. Intervention*, initiative*, program*. Example of search strings could looking like: “place-based” OR “community-based or “area based” or neighbourhood-based” AND “intervention*” OR initiative* OR “program*” AND “child development” OR “child*” OR OR “parent*” of “family*” within title, abstract and keywords. The search string was adapted to the requirements of each database. An additional reference search and grey literature search on Google was also conducted to locate non-academic reports relevant to the topic of review.  2.2 Eligibility criteria and study selection To be included in the scope of this review thus, studies had to meet the following criteria: they must have been published in English between January 1, 2000, and November 1, 2021, and report on outcomes of initiatives aimed at advancing children's (age 0–12) development in areas including but not limited to: (1) Health and Well-being (2) Social and emotional well-being and (2) Cognitive development and academic achievement. Considering that parenting is one of the strongest protective factors for children development (Han et al., 2023 ), programs that aims that improving children development via parenting interventions will also be included. For inclusion in this review, initiatives need to address both “place” and “people”, meaning they were required to utilize place as the fundamental unit of implementation AND demonstrate a joined-up effort and thereby harnessing a collective effort to enhance outcomes for children or parents. Initiatives that merely use place as a geographical location for program delivery, without any effort to incorporating local stakeholders will be excluded. This review considered both academic and grey literature to encompass a comprehensive range of insights. Full details inclusion/exclusion criteria are outlined in Table 1  . Following PRISMA guidelines (see Fig. 1  ), all references identified in the database search were imported into Covidence (6,237) and automatically removed duplicates (99). Two reviewers (Authors 1 and 2), then screened abstracts (6,138) independently, resolving conflicts in discussions. Publications that could not be conclusively assessed based on the abstract were moved to full-text screening, along with those that met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers (Authors 1 and 2), then assessed full texts (2 2 1) for eligibility independently of each other, once again resolving conflicts during discussions. When publications were deemed ineligible, an exclusion reason was assigned. Reference and grey literature search yielded further 22 reports meeting inclusion criteria. During full text review, further exclusion criteria were imposed. For initiatives with multiple reports, the latest report that containing both evaluation information and discussions of implementation or facilitators/barriers were included. An extraction protocol applied by Authors 1 and 2 and 3 to include papers to capture paper’s attributes (i.e. name of initiative, year of publication, domain of child development targeted, scope of programs, evaluation methods…). These meta data was collected on Covidence. All full texts were then imported into NVivo12 for a thematic synthesis of the studies’ findings. A quality assessment it is recognized that a quality assessment is not a conventional component of a scoping review, we have chosen to incorporate this element into our study. This decision was made with the intention of gaining a deeper insight into the current state of the art regarding evaluation methodologies within the field. By assessing the rigor and strength of the evaluation approaches used in place-based interventions, we aim to identify not only what is being reported but also how comprehensively and robustly these reports are being constructed. Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT; Hong, 2018 ) were used for this purpose.   3 Results 3.1 Initiative characteristics In total, 22 published texts met the inclusion criteria, comprising 7 journal articles, 2 MA/PhD theses, and 12 non-academic publications/organizational reports, representing 22 place-based initiatives. Among these initiatives, 4 were founded in the United Kingdom, 5 in Australia, 9 in the United States, 1 in Canada, 2 in Ireland. All initiatives involve children between the ages of 0 and 12. Of these, 18 out of 22 initiatives focus on children aged 6 and under. Eight of the 22 initiatives include primary-school-aged children (ages 6 to 12), and three of these initiatives also involve older age groups (ages 12 to 18). This indicates a predominant focus on early childhood in the existing literature (see Table 2  ).   4 Research question 1: What type of services are being offered? The types of services provided across the initiatives were diverse, encompassing various areas of intervention. Among the 22 initiatives, 16 included school programs such as school readiness initiatives, after-school care, educational support, language and literacy programs, career readiness, and vocational education and training. 17 initiatives focused on parenting interventions, including parenting programs, parenting education, and parenting services aimed at improving children's well-being through enhanced parental care. Eight initiatives emphasized health promotion by offering services such as nutrition programs, speech pathology, health education, and child health services. Additionally, 18 initiatives implemented changes at the community and policy level, including housing improvements, the creation of safe playgrounds, and environmental changes (See Table 3  ). Remarkably, 20 out of the 22 initiatives provided more than one type of service, thereby enhancing the quality of care for children and young people across multiple levels—schools, families, and communities. Only two initiatives, Hishinuma et al. (2009)  and Porter et al. (2019) , focused on service changes in a single context. Nonetheless, both initiatives made significant efforts to involve various stakeholders in their programs. Various engagement methods were also employed to attract families and children to these programs, including local services engagement (Press et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2017 ), home visiting, phone messages, and maintaining continuous contact with participating families throughout the program duration (Knibbs et al., 2013; Renaisi, 2016 ).  5 Research questions 2: What is the intervention focuses and quality of evidence regarding effectiveness? Areas of intervention target included: Child physical health (7), Behavioural, social and Emotional well-being (10) and literacy, academic performance and cognitive skills (12). Spontaneously, 14 studies also touched on parental outcomes (parental well-being (7), parenting practices (11). Among included reports, ten studies employed a mixed-method approach, three studies used primarily qualitative methods (e.g., interview, focus group, documents analysis, case study); and 9 studies employed mainly quantitative methodology. Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 8407 including children, parents or families, and project staff. Two studies did not specify sample size (See Table 4  ). The assessment of risk of bias with the MMAT tool revealed significant variations between studies. In conclusion, 11 studies have a low risk of bias, 6 studies have a moderate risk of bias, and 5 studies contained high risk for bias (Also see Table 4 ). Overall, while the outcomes are mixed, there are more positive reports supporting the impact of PBIs on improving children's development than negative ones. The effects of these interventions are generally small, though some studies reported medium impacts on children's academic outcomes. Detailed outcomes of these reports are outlined below. 5.1 Children physical health Among seven studies focused on improving children's health outcomes, five demonstrated some positive effects, while two showed limited or negative results. For example, The Hui Mālama O Ke Kai (Hishinuma et al., 2009 ) after-school program for example showed that significant positive lifestyle changes in for children attending program in the first year but no improvements in the second year. The Ireland National Early Years Access Initiative (McKeown et al., 2014 ) also reported a small improvement in children's physical health at school entry after three years of implementation (d  = 0.18). The Children Healthy Living (Butel, 2018 ) intervention in the U.S-affiliated Pacific islands reduced children's screen time, with higher intervention doses correlating with greater reductions. Other programs that reported positive outcomes include the Healthy Eating Active Living Zone Initiative (Cheadle et al., 2018 ), which aimed to prevent obesity by engaging students in physical activities during school recess. This initiative led to a 17 %-19 % increase in moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and improved milk choices among children. Additionally, Play Streets (Porter et al., 2019 ) effectively encouraged physical activity by closing local streets to create safe play spaces for youth. The evaluation demonstrated an increased rate of physical activity among children and youth in Play Streets compared to other areas, although these outcomes were not accompanied by statistical analyses. In contrast, the Children's Community (Batty et al., 2018 ) showed limited health improvements across three intervention areas, with only a small reduction in obesity rates in two communities and an increase in one. The Community for Children initiative (Muir et al., 2010 ) suggested that parents in intervention regions reported worse child health compared to control sites, although no raw data was provided.  5.2 Children social emotional development With ten studies reporting on outcomes related to children's social and emotional well-being, seven demonstrated positive effects on enhancing children's social and emotional development while two found no significant effect. Examples of positive outcomes include the Go Goldfields Initiative (Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015 ), which saw statistically significant drops in the proportion of children classified as vulnerable in social competence and emotional maturity at school entry in the intervention region. The ABC Program also reported significant improvements in children’s social and emotional well-being across intervention sites (Hickey et al., 2018 ). The Strong Community for Children Initiative (McDonell et al., 2015 ) found a reduction in child injuries indicative of neglect, with a medium effect size (d  = 0.52), and a decrease in injuries resulting from maltreatment, with a small to medium effect size (d  = 0.32) but no significant difference in the rates of child injuries suggesting physical abuse and the rates of substantiated cases of physical abuse and neglect compared to control areas. Other positive outcomes were observed in initiatives such as Hui Mālama O Ke Kai (Hishinuma et al., 2009 ), which had a beneficial impact on children's self-esteem, healthy lifestyle choices, and knowledge of violence prevention strategies. The Ireland National Early Years Access Initiative (McKeown et al., 2014 ) also reported improvements in students' social competency (d  = 0.23) and emotional maturity (d  = 0.16) at school entry. Similar positive findings were noted by Melhuish et al. (2007)  for Sure Start, who reported significant improvements in children's social competency at 9 months, and by Muir et al. (2010)  for Community for Children who found enhancements in children's emotional and behavioral problems in a hard-to-reach subsample. Additionally, Press et al. (2016)  reported some success in preventing children from falling behind in their development, though no significant testing was reported for these outcomes. Two evaluations showed no improvement in children's social and emotional well-being was the Flying Start program (Knibbs et al., 2013 ) which found no improvements in children's and young people's development skills, confidence, and knowledge through their community services. Similarly, the Children Communities Program (Batty et al., 2018 ) saw increases in the proportion of children within the intervention area achieving a good level of development comparable with national level increases, but no significant improvement was attributable to the intervention.  5.3 Literacy, academic performance and cognitive skills Children's academic performance and cognitive skills are key focus areas for many PBIs, with 12 out of 22 initiatives targeting these aspects (see Table 4 ). Among these, seven studies specifically reported on children's academic outcomes. Results indicated that PBIs were effective in increasing school attendance without delay (Austin, 2010 ) and supporting school readiness (Austin, 2010; Hickey et al., 2018; Institute for Families in Society, 2019 ). Improvements in academic performance and literacy were also observed. For instance, significant gains in student knowledge and academic success were achieved through the Hui Malama O Ke Kai program (Hishinuma et al., 2009 ). The Children's Community intervention areas also showed comparable improvements in academic performance, school engagement, and state tests to those in matched control regions and national trends. After three years, one region exhibited a statistically significant improvement in students' academic performance (26 % vs. 11 %) (Batty et al., 2018 ). The National Literacy Trust Hub (Cappellini et al., 2020 ) reported significant increases in the percentage of children achieving expected competency in literacy in the first implemented region compared to matched regions and the national average. The Energy Express program (Butera et al., 2000 ) also demonstrated improvements in children's literacy though case studies. Cognitive development (language development, verbal capacity and cognitive performance) was reported in six studies (Cappellini et al., 2020; Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015; Knibbs et al., 2013; McKeown et al., 2014; Melhuish et al., 2007; Muir et al., 2010 ). Among them, McKeown et al. (2014) , reported medium to large improvements in children's language and cognitive skills at school entry (d  = 0.59) for the Ireland National Early Years Access Initiative’s intervention areas. Muir et al. (2010) , also reported significantly greater proficiency in vocabulary and verbal ability of children within the Community for Children than their control counterparts. Similarly, Melhuish et al. (2007)  reported improvements in Sure Start’s children's verbal and non-verbal capacity at 9 months and Cappellini et al. (2020)  also reported positive improvements in children's language development for those with National Literacy Trust Hub. However, their outcomes should be interpreted with caution as improvement was not observed long-term (Melhuish et al., 2007 ) and no statistical significance details were provided (Cappellini et al., 2020 ). Two studies found no significant improvements in children's language and cognitive development. The Go Goldfields Alliance (Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership, 2015 ) and The Flying Start initiative (Knibbs et al., 2013 ) both initiatives showed some improvements, such as a drop in the proportion of students needing speech pathology interventions at school entry from 60 % to 27 % in the Go Goldfields area and higher parental satisfaction with local health services in Flying Start areas. However, neither study found statistically significant improvements in children's language and cognitive development.  5.4 Parenting and parental well-being As quality of parenting have pervasive influence on the healthy development and wellbeing of children, many interventions also have changing parenting as targeted outcomes. Among fourteen studies that evaluated the impact of place-based intervention on parenting and parental wellbeing, eleven studies included parenting-related outcomes and ten found positive influences (e.g., Cappellini et al., 2020; Hornick et al., 2006; McDonell et al., 2015; Press et al., 2016; Renaisi, 2016 ). For example, immediately after participating in the Best Start Program (Hornick et al., 2006 ), parents reported significant increases in knowledge of child development and accuracy in perceiving the temperament of their children compared to the control group. One-year post-intervention, parents reported statistically significant increased confidence in parenting. For the Strong Community for Children initiative (McDonell et al., 2015 ), parents in the intervention region reported significantly greater rate of nurturing parenting (d  = 0.33), less disengaged parenting (d  = 0.37), less neglectful parenting (d  = 0.40), and decreased parental stress (d  = 0.10). However, changes in parenting self-efficacy (d  = 0.01) and physical and verbal assault (d  = 0.24) were not significant. Qualitative studies also provided insights to this topic. In the interviews of participants of the Stronger Families Alliance (Press et al., 2016 ), through participating in different community-based programs, parents reported increased knowledge of child language development and how to facilitate children’s literacy development at home. For the Parent 1st initiative (Renaisi, 2016 ), parents reported improvements post-intervention in their identified top antenatal concerns and postnatal concerns such as parenting skills. However, the Flying Start program (Knibbs et al., 2013 ) reported no significant differences post-intervention between the parents in the intervention regions and parents in the control regions in parenting self-efficacy. To support the parenting journey, seven studies reported outcomes related to parental wellbeing. Receiving social support and making a connection with others is a frequently mentioned outcome (Bess & Doykos, 2014; Hornick et al., 2006; Knibbs et al., 2013; Press et al., 2016; Renaisi, 2016; Taylor et al., 2017 ). Another commonly mentioned outcome is parental distress level or stress management ability (Hornick et al., 2006; Knibbs et al., 2013; McDonell et al., 2015 ). However, outcomes were often small in magnitude or non-significant. Significantly, Muir et al. (2010)  found that within their sample, parents who had low education actually reported worsen mental health over time.   6 Research question 3: What are the factors that may help or hinder the success of PBIs? The factors that may influence the success of PBIs were analyzed through thematic analysis. Following Pollock et al. (2022), a deductive thematic analysis approach was used to synthesize key findings from the literature. The mind map outlines the main themes and sub-themes identified. These categories and examples are further elaborated upon in the subsequent narrative discussion. 6.1 A well-planned implementation framework Most reports underscored the critical need for a robust implementation framework to ensure the success of PBIs. While the frameworks for PBIs varied, they shared several key characteristics. Primarily, the frameworks commonly highlight the necessity of having well-articulated and measurable outcomes. Such clarity in objectives not only fosters momentum and support but also clarifies roles and expectations for all stakeholders involved (Batty et al., 2018; Cheadle et al., 2018; Hornick et al., 2006; Muir et al., 2010 ). Another component that was consistently stressed across PBIs was a shared vision. It is crucial to gather unaligned services for the same purpose, define and agree on the challenge to be solved, identify desired outcomes, as well as establish a strategic framework for action and a timeline for success for that action (Austin, 2010; Batty et al., 2018; McDonell et al., 2015; McKeown et al., 2014; Press et al., 2016 ). The significance of a clear and coordinated plan (Austin, 2010; Batty et al., 2018; Butel, 2018; Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015; Hornick et al., 2006; Press et al., 2016 ) and strong communication between collaborators was also acknowledged (Batty et al., 2018; Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015; Hickey et al., 2018; Press et al., 2016 ). The other important parts of planning for projects, as highlighted by the included documents, is building trust among collaborating entities. Trust is the foundation of any successful collaboration, as it fosters open communication, reduces conflicts, and enhances cooperative problem-solving (Batty et al., 2018; Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015; Hickey et al., 2018 ). When trust is established, partners are more likely to share information, provide mutual support, and work together towards achieving shared objectives. Trust is one of the most highlighted subthemes across studies (Austin, 2010; Batty et al., 2018; Butel, 2018; Butera et al., 2000; Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015; Hishinuma et al., 2009; Hornick et al., 2006; Muir et al., 2010 ). Although less frequently reported, two additional factors—allowing time for modifications and strong leadership—were also identified as critical to the success of PBI initiatives. Allowing time for modifications is crucial because it acknowledges that implementation is an iterative process (Batty et al., 2018; Butel, 2018 ). Programs often require adjustments based on real-world challenges, feedback from stakeholders, and evolving needs of the target population. By building in time for modifications, PBIs can adapt more effectively to unforeseen issues and improve their strategies based on what is working or not. This flexibility ensures that the initiatives remain relevant and can continuously improve their impact. Strong leadership is equally essential, as it provides the vision, direction, and motivation needed to drive PBIs forward. Strong leadership was emphasized in five reports (Austin, 2010; Batty et al., 2018; Hickey et al., 2018; Hornick et al., 2006; Institute for Families in Society, 2019 ). Effective leaders can inspire and mobilize stakeholders, manage resources efficiently, and navigate the complexities of multi-agency collaborations. They play a critical role in maintaining the momentum of the initiatives, fostering a collaborative culture, and ensuring that all partners remain committed to the shared goals. Both of these factors complement the other critical elements such as clear objectives, shared vision, and trust among collaborators. They ensure that PBIs can not only be implemented successfully but also sustained and adapted over time to maximize their positive impact on children's development.  6.2 Local services buy-in Positive outcomes were more likely when stakeholders were open to new methods and approaches. Engagement with local services needs to start early in the design phase and continue throughout the implementation stages. This theme was emphasized in 12 out of 22 reports (Fig. 2  ). Relationships with local services could become barriers when stakeholders believed that existing operational methods were sufficient and saw no necessity for change. Resistance to new approaches often stemmed from a deep-seated confidence in traditional methods (Batty et al., 2018 ). Prior to program design, the implementation team thus needed to take time to understand existing services and how they operated. This understanding was vital to navigate resistance and find ways to integrate new practices without alienating stakeholders. This sub-theme was mentioned in five out of 22 studies (Austin, 2010; Batty et al., 2018; Hickey et al., 2018; Hishinuma et al., 2009; Melhuish et al., 2007; Press et al., 2016 ). When designing the intervention, it was then important for the team to find a balance between leveraging local assets and introducing innovation. This theme was recognized in four studies (Batty et al., 2018; Bess & Doykos, 2014; Butel, 2018; Press et al., 2016 ). Recognizing and utilizing the strengths and resources already present in the community while integrating new, evidence-based practices helped gain local buy-in and ensured that interventions were both practical and effective (Batty et al., 2018; Bess & Doykos, 2014; Butel, 2018; Press et al., 2016 ). This balance helped to ensure that new programs were seen as enhancements rather than replacements, fostering greater acceptance and cooperation. Another sub-theme that arose within this local service buy-in theme is building and nurturing relationships with local stakeholders, through engagement local staff. Ongoing engagement with local staff is important not only for implementation but also for the continued evaluation of the program. There are different ways through which PBIs can engage with local staff. First, PBIs can ensure that their staff are present at multiple local levels in the early stages to help involve stakeholders and to train local staff with the skills and knowledge necessary to implement new practices effectively (Hornick et al., 2006; Melhuish et al., 2007 ). When the project is underway, while project staff can gradually withdraw from services, regular check-ins and ongoing training should be provided, if possible, to maintain and deepen engagement for long-term, sustainable project implementation (Batty et al., 2018; Hickey et al., 2018; McKeown et al., 2014; Muir et al., 2010 ). Different models of engagement might also be needed in different contexts to address unique local challenges and dynamics (Batty et al., 2018 ). This adaptive approach ensured that interventions were tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of each community, increasing their chances of success. Despite substantial investment in these areas, however, it was also noted that uniform adaptation of the program across different communities was not always assured. There was often resistance to fully integrating new programs, as operational staff might revert to traditional, well-established practices to achieve outcomes. This tendency could diminish the potential for wider systemic change (Batty et al., 2018; Butel, 2018; Muir et al., 2010 ).  6.3 Community engagement The effectiveness of PBIs was recognized as being closely tied to community involvement, a theme reflected in codes extracted from 12 out of 22 studies (Fig. 2 ). Various strategies have been employed to engage children and their families effectively, with community involvement emphasized at different stages of implementation. For instance, the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy aimed to remove barriers to participation through offering a “soft” entry to the program. This involved carefully selecting familiar and non-threatening locations for families, such as community centers or local schools. Ensuring that the service location is accessible and welcoming (Muir et al., 2010 ). Another way to remove barriers is by simplifying the participation process. This can include offering additional benefits that address practical challenges faced by families, such as providing free childcare, meals, and giveaways during program sessions, similar to the Tied Together initiative. These incentives can significantly increase service uptake by making it more convenient and appealing for families to participate. By removing logistical obstacles, PBIs can ensure that more families benefit from the program’s offerings (Bess & Doykos, 2014 ). Establishing trusted and stable sources of local support was also identified as a crucial sub-theme of community engagement. Families are more likely to engage with programs when they feel supported by familiar and stable community resources that are there for the long term, rather than short-term initiatives. This can involve partnering with local organizations that already have established relationships with the target population (Bess & Doykos, 2014; Hickey et al., 2018 ). By leveraging these existing connections, PBIs can enhance their credibility and accessibility, making it easier for families to trust and utilize the services provided (Batty et al., 2018; Muir et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2017 ). Connecting with families through a strength-based approach is essential for building trust and fostering long-term engagement. This theme, addressed in 7 out of 11 reports on community engagement, suggests that PBIs should emphasize building on the strengths and capabilities of families rather than focusing on fixing weaknesses (Fig. 2 ). This approach views families as agents of change who can drive improvements in their own lives and communities. By recognizing and nurturing the existing strengths within families, PBIs can empower participants, fostering a sense of ownership and active participation in the program (Batty et al., 2018; Butel, 2018; Butera et al., 2000 ). This method not only enhances trust but also encourages families to take a proactive role in the process of change (Bess & Doykos, 2014; Hornick et al., 2006; Melhuish et al., 2007; Renaisi, 2016 ).  6.4 Structural support Despite careful involvement of local communities in the planning and design stages, the success of a program cannot be assured. Various factors, including the level of structural and policitcal support available for children and their families, can impede the effectiveness of program outcomes. This theme was reported in four studies (Fig. 2 ). Access to additional services and resources could significantly enhance the impact of a project. However, structural barriers in disadvantaged communities often present substantial challenges. For example, the Go Goldfield Alliance (Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015 ), which focused on promoting reading among young children, illustrated this point well. While the program effectively engaged children, the broader issue of low family literacy limited their educational progress. Furthermore, at the program’s conclusion, even if children achieved significant improvements and were ready for the labor market, the lack of local job or training opportunities prevented them from benefiting from these gains (Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015 ). Addressing these barriers necessitates long-term planning and significant interventions. It is crucial to continue efforts to mitigate the structural disadvantages faced by children, ensuring adequate funding and policy support for these initiatives. This includes investing in community infrastructure, enhancing educational resources, and creating job opportunities to support sustainable development (Batty et al., 2018; Institute for Families in Society, 2019; Porter et al., 2019 ). Only through a holistic approach that addresses both immediate needs and underlying structural issues can we ensure that the benefits of PBIs are fully realized and that children in disadvantaged communities can truly thrive.  6.5 A reliable outcome tracking system The success of PBIs also depends on their continual revision and adjustment to meet local demands. Achieving this requires a comprehensive and well-designed outcome tracking system. This theme was emphasized in 13 out of 22 studies, yet only seven reports indicated the presence of a long-term evaluation plan with a clear framework (Batty et al., 2018; Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015; Hornick et al., 2006; Institute for Families in Society, 2019; Knibbs et al., 2013; Melhuish et al., 2007; Muir et al., 2010; Renaisi, 2016 ). Even when a framework is in place, however, the findings are often overshadowed by significant challenges with evaluation activities. This oversight in evaluation may stem from several challenges. First, evaluation activities can be time-consuming and costly (Austin, 2010; Batty et al., 2018; Butera et al., 2000; Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015; Hickey et al., 2018; Press et al., 2016 ). PBIs, which target disadvantaged and hard-to-reach populations, often prioritize building partnerships and community engagement over evaluation. Consequently, by the time a program is ready for evaluation, the available funding is frequently depleted, preventing comprehensive and reliable assessments of the program's impact (McDonell et al., 2015 ). Second, tracking progress and outcomes at the local level presents significant challenges. Even when an evaluation framework is included in the plan, many local institutions lack the necessary capacities and processes to collect quality evidence (Batty et al., 2018; Hickey et al., 2018; McDonell et al., 2015 ). This shortfall can greatly hinder the effectiveness and accuracy of program evaluations. Moreover, conducting a comprehensive evaluation requires effective collaboration and communication among various partners, including government bodies, community services, and healthcare providers (Knibbs et al., 2013; McDonell et al., 2015 ). Another potential challenge that arises by the time evaluations are initiated is that many of the core personnel integral to the project may have moved on to other positions or left the organization. Local staff on the other hand do not have training and capacity to collect quality data (Batty et al., 2018 ). This turnover complicates efforts to coordinate and collect impactful data, significantly affecting the continuity and effectiveness of the evaluation process (McDonell et al., 2015 ). Additionally, there is a risk that self-reported achievements may be biased, potentially portraying changes as more comprehensive and sustainable than they actually are. This can lead to an overestimation of a program's effectiveness and mislead stakeholders about its true impact (Cheadle et al., 2018 ). Several recommendations have been suggested to address these issues include: (1) Allowing adequate time for evaluation activities (Austin, 2010; Batty et al., 2018; Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015; McDonell et al., 2015; Press et al., 2016 ). (2) Enhancing local service capacity to collect data (Batty et al., 2018; Hickey et al., 2018 ). (3) Developing shared measurement systems across stakeholders and (Institute for Families in Society, 2019; Knibbs et al., 2013; McDonell et al., 2015; Press et al., 2016 ). (4) Integrating multi-level evaluation plans for both short-term and long-term outcomes (Hornick et al., 2006; Knibbs et al., 2013; McKeown et al., 2014 ).   7 Discussion This scoping review aimed to provide a narrative synthesis of the current PBIs that support on children development, as well as factors that help or hinder their success. e examined the types of services offered by PBIs targeting children as the primary beneficiaries, the outcomes they measured, and the key implementation factors contributing to the success of these interventions. The review revealed that current PBIs, despite their diverse objectives, consistently emphasize an integrated approach. Most programs address issues across multiple community sectors rather than focusing on a single area, thereby supporting children's development and assisting parents comprehensively. Even those with limited resources managed to engage various stakeholders in the implementation process, enhancing the potential for successful outcomes. In summary, the findings underscore the importance of a collaborative, multi-sectoral approach in PBIs, highlighting that involving a broad range of stakeholders for achieving positive results. Across evaluations, it was also observed that most of current PBIs strongly focus on the early years with less focus on the later childhood period. Outcomes reported mixed findings, but positive changes seem to be observed at least in one or two domains of children outcomes by initiatives. Yet, the outcomes reports are questionable due to the lack of rigorous evaluation methods. Most of reports lack the specific details regarding how changes were detected. In this study, we meticulously reviewed each included work, applying a comprehensive appraisal framework to assess study quality. The quality assessment revealed that 5 out of 22 (22.7 %) studies exhibited a high risk of bias due to unclear methodologies and evaluation processes. Among the studies with moderate or low risk of bias, some, did attempt to apply rigorous methodologies. For example, five studies utilized comparable regions or state/national averages as controls (Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership, 2015; Hornick et al., 2006; Knibbs et al., 2013; McDonell et al., 2015; Muir et al., 2010 ). Out of the 19 quantitative or mixed-method studies, nine tested the statistical significance of the intervention effects (Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership, 2015; Hishinuma et al., 2009; Hornick et al., 2006; McDonell et al., 2015; Melhuish et al., 2007; Muir et al., 2010; Porter et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2017 ). However, the rest of studies utilized primarily descriptive evaluation methods lacking sophisticated and robust analyses necessary for establishing a comprehensive understanding of causality. Additionally, most studies reported outcomes with insufficient details regarding statistical procedures or did not include a control sample, complicating the accurate estimation of impact magnitudes. These findings align with recent review of place-based programs serving both the general population and children are available (Crew, 2020; Glover et al., 2021; Moore & Fry, 2011; Wilks et al., 2015 ). This issue is understandable, given that more than 50 % of the included reports are organizational reports rather than scientific publications, which may not require detailed statistical procedures to be reported. Furthermore, the complexity of PBIs, involving multiple sectors and various evaluation sizes, often makes it nearly impossible to establish control groups or gather quantitative data at the community level for robust testing of program's effectiveness and progress. This challenge is also indicative of the current implementations of place-based interventions, which often lack the capacity and a well-established evaluation framework. Additionally, determining the effect sizes was problematic, as most studies did not include a control group, making it difficult to measure true impacts accurately. In light of the findings on this review, there are several key learnings that can be drawn: First, it is crucial for PBIs to have well thought plan for evaluation . While the reasons for the modest effects that current programs have on children and families remain unclear, the observed low quality of research in this area suggested that these minimal or absent effects might not stem from the nature of the program outcomes themselves, but rather from the poor quality of research design. Consequently, policies, practices, and implementation activities based on such designs might be likely misleading. To ensure the validity and effectiveness of a program, a robust evaluation system must be integrated with the implementation process. Access to local-level data is crucial for the success of place-based evaluations. Investing resources in training local staff would not only facilitate the collection of quality data but also empower local community partners to continue assessing and evaluating their services independently in the future. Ideally, progress reports should be supported by secondary data, incorporating strategy-level evaluations through direct observation and environmental assessments, to provide a more comprehensive view of the program's impact (Batty et al., 2018; Bess & Doykos, 2014; Central Victorian Primary Care Partnership 2015; Children’s Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service 2020 ). Future evaluations should also seek to understand the mechanisms of change that contribute to project success or failure. Second, more effort needs to be spent on actively engaging children and families in all phases of the project. While a lmost all initiatives demonstrated effort to actively involved the voices of children and families in the programs, efforts are mostly spent at the implementation and evaluation. It remains unclear how these inputs are integrated into the actual design of services. The inadequate incorporation of end-user perspectives in program development represents a widespread issue, not only within PBIs but also across contemporary social services. This challenge is particularly acute in disadvantaged communities, where residents often feel disempowered and overlooked. For these less visible and less connected community members, special efforts may be necessary to ensure they can participate meaningfully and influence the services intended to benefit them. (Raderstrong & Boyea-Robinson, 2016; South, 2015 ). This implies that children and families should be actively and continuously consulted throughout all phases of the intervention, including its design, implementation, and evaluation. Consequently, programs might need to shift their focus away from solely delivering services to instead creating an environment that empowers children and families to achieve their own goals. This approach fosters a more collaborative and inclusive atmosphere, ensuring that the interventions are truly responsive to the needs of those they aim to serve (Grönroos & Voima, 2013; Heinonen et al., 2010 ).  Third, careful consideration of political and funding support is crucial for program sustainability . The sustained success of PBIs is dependent on establishing and maintaining a strong relationship with policymakers. Katz et al. (2022)  observed that the inconsistent functioning of PBIs can often be ascribed to changes in political administration and the gradual shift in policies over time. Therefore, the consistent application of policies is essential to preserve the integrity of program objectives across varying governmental terms. Research, including a meta -evaluation of UK place-based health initiatives, suggests such programs are most effective when bolstered by unwavering political support, reliable funding, and steadfast goals. While there have been instances of initiatives adeptly leveraging government funds to expand their reach, others have encountered obstacles stemming from political upheaval, jeopardizing the stability and long-term viability of these collaborations (O’Dwyer et al., 2007 ). To address such problems, one way is to ensure that budgets are properly planned with money coming from both government and non-profit sources. As a result, PBIs can have the support of policy makers while maintaining relative independence from the continual change of governments, priorities and funding (Clarke, 2017 ). Finally, future PBIs need prepared for the change of “place” concept in the digital era . PBIs − along with many existing public services (e.g., the police, public libraries, and healthcare facilities) are designed to facilitate face-to-face interactions. The event of COVID-19, however, challenges this deeply rooted approach to service delivery, calling upon service designers to develop new methods of interaction and engagement that will enable the business to survive in uncertain times (Xie et al., 2020 ). During the last three years, digitalizing service delivery has certainly become more common. During the pandemic, zoom-based services are mandatory. Human services have tremendously benefited from digital health interventions, including telemedicine, web-based strategies, email, mobile phones, mobile apps, text messaging, and monitoring sensors. (Lember et al., 2019; Van Doorn et al., 2017 ). A shift from face-to-face communication to online communication has a significant impact on PBIs. First of all, it challenges the idea of a place. 'Place' no longer indicates a physical location but rather the work environment within which people exist that combines physical and digital elements. Second, it challenged a traditional method of providing public services that relied on face-to-face interactions, allowing a new era where technology can be considered a vital part of PBIs. Combining online delivery with automated and smart services can drastically reduce healthcare costs and extend the reach of services/interventions outside of a particular geographical area. Additionally, having the ability to collect and analyze large amounts of data about users can improve the effectiveness of PBIs by allowing the project team to make timely and evidence-based decisions; reduce implementation errors (Noorbakhsh-Sabet et al., 2019 ). Technology can also be used to increase reach at the population level by tailoring the program to individual needs and preferences. This adaptability is arguably one of technology's greatest strengths. The progression of PBIs may thus be enhanced by technologies that offer not just scalability but also the capacity for customization, addressing specific local and personal needs essential to the program's success. Yet, it's important to view technological advancements not just as additional resources to be incorporated into a value proposition, but as means to innovatively synergize existing resources for greater efficacy (Maglio & Spohrer, 2013 ). It is important to understand that children and families may or may not be interested in or have access to the infrastructure required to engage with technologies devolved to them (e.g., knowledge, network, platform, devices, etc.) (Eriksson & Hellström, 2021 ). Many digitalized services today are designed under the assumption that their users have access to fast Internet, possess smart devices, and know how to use them. This assumption is not true for many disadvantaged communities (Lember et al., 2019; Townsend, 2013 ). As a result, the introduction of technology should be accompanied by infrastructure support, ensuring that services are available, and that children and families are able to access them. 7.1 Limitations This systematic review has several limitations. Its primary aim was to examine the services provided by multi-component, community based PBIs for children and families, encompassing a broad spectrum of outcomes. Due to this diversity, conducting a meta -analysis was unfeasible, resulting in a narrative synthesis without comparative analysis. Also, the inclusion criteria for this systematic review were limited to English-language articles that reported on initiatives comprehensively involving various community sectors in the intervention. This may account for the predominance of studies focused on communities within high-income countries, including the US, Canada, UK, and Australia. Subsequent reviews could broaden their scope to encompass non-English literature, or potentially focus to uncover insights onto PBIs in non-English speaking regions and, by extension, in lower-income countries with limited resources. While this review acknowledges and discusses the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PBIs, the evidence available at the time of completion this review was scant concerning the pandemic's actual effects on PBIs. The unprecedented nature of COVID-19 and its global ramifications suggested that its influence on community dynamics and intervention strategies could be significant. Consequently, future research should prioritize the examination of how PBIs have adapted to these challenges. Investigating the resilience and responsiveness of PBIs during the pandemic will be crucial in understanding the full scope of COVID-19′s influence on place-based program effectiveness and the well-being of the communities they serve.   8 Conclusions PBI programs seek to address complex problems by bringing together multiple stakeholders within the communities to build better coordinated and more effective services and service systems. In this review, we examine the effectiveness of current PBIs programs that address both “place” and “people” to support children and their families. So far, there is evidence pointing to the effectiveness of multi-component, community based PBIs approach on children's and families' health and well-being. The overall impact across PBIs however is unclear. Intervention effects if found are relatively small and data is limited to short-term outcomes only. It is not known to what extent the effectiveness of these programs is maintained for meaningful and long-term improvements that lead to positive life changes. In order to establish the effectiveness of these programs in promoting health, a more robust data collection method must be implemented. In addition, it is vital to start planning and thinking about PBIs in an era when a place is no longer constrained to a physical location. This entails recognizing that our conceptualization of place must evolve to reflect the changing dynamics of how communities interact and operate within both physical and digital realms.
