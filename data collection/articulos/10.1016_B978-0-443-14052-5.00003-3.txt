               The rate of urbanization has been on the upswing in most parts of the World, with debate on its effects both on the positive and negative sides. Regardless of the benefits that come with it, rapid and unmanaged urbanization has more negative effects on developing economies including persistent population increases, inadequate housing, and uncontrolled urban growth patterns. Such effects contribute greatly to homelessness which remains a reality among the majority of urban dwellers in developing countries. Since cities are important components in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring sustainable urbanization and housing for all becomes central in improving human living standards. Based on the current global focus, this chapter investigates the link between urbanization, poverty, and homelessness, in the face of SDGs, and within the context of Zambian cities. This chapter finds a strong link between urbanization, poverty, and homelessness which works negatively against the achievement of SDGs. It thus points to four key areas for reforms, namely: urban planning, land service delivery and housing, urban land administration, and incorporation of sustainable urban practices. This chapter was mainly based on a case study approach, literature review, and interviews with key informants.

(2013) , Kennedy (2015) , Satterthwaite and Mitlin (2013) , Susser (1996) , Timmer et al. (2019)  show a direct link between urbanization, poverty, and homelessness. The formulation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is partly a response to these global challenges. Specifically, SDGs 1 and 11, “No poverty” and “Sustainable Cities and Communities,” respectively, then become important global calls for action to deal with these challenges. Urbanization, as a trigger, can have both positive and negative consequences. For instance, urbanization provides greater opportunities for employment, social services, and modern facilities which are essential in improving living conditions and sustaining social progress (Cohen, 2006 ). However, unmanaged and rapid urbanization remains a global challenge, especially in developing countries, as it negatively affects social equity, public health, and the environment (Gu, 2019 ). Despite rapid urbanization and population growth, evidence shows a decline in new housing stock and inadequate urban housing infrastructure to support the increasing population. This has greatly contributed to homelessness, especially among the urban poor (Akinluyi & Adedokun, 2014 ; Bodo, 2019 ; Chiluba et al., 2021 ). Homelessness then becomes one of the major challenges to economic development and the welfare of citizens, as housing is universally acknowledged as one of the most basic human needs for life (Akinluyi & Adedokun, 2014 ). With the current global focus on SDGs, urbanization and cities play a greater  role in attainment of such goals (Chen et al., 2022 ; Kroll et al., 2019 ) and homelessness endangers the ultimate success of all the 17 SDGs (Casey & Stazen, 2021 ). Studies, though, show that the specific linkages have to be contextualized within different environments. This chapter thus investigates the link between urbanization, poverty, and homelessness in the Zambian context. It focuses on four major cities of Zambia (Lusaka, Kitwe, Ndola, and Livingstone). It further links the findings to strategies toward the achievement of SDGs asserting that the current conditions are a threat to the achievement of these goals. After this opening section, this chapter then highlights the rationale of the study, which is followed by the materials and methods used. The section on results and discussions is then given, followed by the limitations of the study. Sections on recommendations and conclusions are then given before ending with acknowledgments.  2 Limitations of the study This study was mainly limited to the data collection process and focused largely on literature review. Nonetheless, this chapter still provides insights into urbanization, poverty, and homelessness in major Zambian cities in lights of the SDGs.  3 Materials and methods This chapter was mainly based on a case study approach, literature review, and interviews with key informants. The understanding of urbanization, poverty, and homelessness in relation to SDGs was based on a combination of peer-reviewed published literature and expert knowledge. The Google Scholar search engine was used to filter published research in peer-reviewed journals or authoritative public reports from official organizations (such as United Nations). The review process involved searching the literature based on terms associated with “urbanization,” “homelessness,” “poverty,” and SDGs. The arguments and evidence found in the literature and reports, together with the expertise of planners in the specified cities, guided the discussion on the interaction among urbanization, homelessness, poverty, and SDGs. The findings are helpful in improving understanding of urbanization and homelessness, especially in relation to SDGs as well as strategies for sustainable urbanization and housing. This chapter then focused on Zambia as a case study.  4 Rationale of the study Sub-Saharan Africa, with an urban population estimated at 42%, is arguably one of the most urbanized regions in the world; with serious implications on the provision of housing and other urban services for the majority of urban dwellers (Bodo, 2019 ; Chigudu & Chavunduka, 2021 ; Herner et al., 2018 ). The result is that 56% of the urban population is said to be living in informal settlements which lack clean water and sanitation facilities for residents, consequently threatening the attainment of sustainable development goals in developing countries (Casey & Stazen, 2021 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Chiluba et al., 2021 ). Sustainable  urbanization and housing concerns influence the global direction toward sustainable development in terms of economic, social, resource, environmental, and ecological aspects and provide focused perspectives for implementing the SDGs (Chen et al., 2019 ; Chen et al., 2022 ). This calls for an urgent need to understand the interaction between urbanization, poverty, homelessness, and SDGs, hence the justification for this study. 4.1 Urbanization as a global phenomenon Urbanization is currently a global phenomenon affecting all nations. Among various definitions, urbanization is perceived as an increase in the global population proportion living in cities (Akinluyi & Adedokun, 2014 ; Bodo, 2019 ). It involves transforming human production and lives from rural to cities including population concentration, drastic landscape changes and nonagricultural activities which affect the social and natural environments (Chen et al., 2022 ; Tonne et al., 2021 ). Most literature has referred the continued rural–urban migration (mass movement of people from rural settlements to cities) and rate of natural increase (more births than deaths) to be major sources of population increase, especially with advanced technology and developmental projects. The majority of studies consider rural–urban migration to have been the greatest source of rapid urbanization between 1950s and 1970s, while natural increase has been the greatest source in the past 2 decades (Bodo, 2019 ). Individual and corporate efforts to reduce commuting time and transportation expenses while improving jobs, education, housing, marketplace, and competition opportunities in cities have been other natural causes of urbanization (Akinluyi & Adedokun, 2014 ; Chiluba et al., 2021 ). The current trajectory shows an unabating rise in the urban population. In most developed countries, urbanization contributes to improving economic conditions and living standards of people, especially when complemented by industrialization. Unfortunately, rapid urbanization in most developing countries has led to rapid population growth, resulting in observable adverse effects such as poverty, housing crisis, and inadequate land for development (Akinluyi & Adedokun, 2014 ; Bodo, 2019 ; Chiluba et al., 2021 ). Poverty is evidenced through lack of well-paying jobs and growth in informal employment opportunities. This has contributed to homelessness resulting in declining quality of life and increases in diseases, infant mortality, malnutrition, insecurity, and breakdown of family cohesiveness and community spirit (Bodo, 2019 ). Housing crisis is evidenced through inadequate housing which remains a global concern and has greatly contributed to homelessness which persists among the majority, poor urban dwellers. This has resulted in housing informality for millions and growth of informal settlements and acute service delivery challenges. Inadequate land is evidenced through growth of settlements in flood prone areas, consequently increasing the intensity and frequency of harmful flood events and environmental degradation (World Bank, 2022 ).  4.2 Demographic trends in the urbanization process Cities in developing countries, have usually served as sources of job opportunities (Bodo, 2019 ; World Bank, 2022 ) which has greatly contributed to rapid urban population growth as the majority of the people see opportunities in urban areas. For instance, the global urban population was 34% of the total in 1960 which increased to 43% by 1990. By 2014, this  percentage had grown to 54% globally (Bodo, 2019 ; UN-DESA, 2014 ). The World's population residing in cities is currently estimated at 55% and is anticipated to reach 60% by 2030 and 65% by 2050 (Bodo, 2019 ). Regardless of the scale and speed of urbanization globally, it is anticipated that about 90% of future growth would occur in developing countries across Asia and Africa (UN-ESC, 2019 ); with serious implications given the economic capacities of countries in these regions. Ensuring sustainable global prosperity will require greater understanding of the unsustainable conditions (including homelessness) resulting from the current urbanization conditions (Bodo, 2019 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Fu et al., 2019 ).  4.3 Homelessness as a human and global challenge Homelessness still remains a global challenge affecting all facets of mankind. It is one of the most acute forms of material deprivation as it makes people incapable of enjoying permanent accommodation (Casey & Stazen, 2021 ; Chiluba et al., 2021 ). Among various definitions by different jurisdictions, countries, and regions, homelessness is seen as “living in severely inadequate accommodation without security of tenure and access to basic services” (Casey & Stazen, 2021 , p. 67) and is categorized (Speak, 2004 ). It thus includes people living in buildings below the minimum standards, temporary accommodation, and on the streets. It can further be categorized as (Chiluba et al., 2021 ): primary  for those living on the streets; secondary  for those moving between temporary shelters and emergency accommodation; and tertiary  for those living in private boarding houses lacking private bathroom or security of tenure. The homeless mostly are poor and lack steady income which makes them incapable of acquiring and maintaining regular, safe, secure, and adequate housing. Despite having the universal basic human rights to adequate housing, inadequacy has been one of the greatest causes of homelessness in cities (Bodo, 2019 ). For instance, it is estimated that globally, the homeless people who require access to housing and basic infrastructure services from 25 years and above are about 50 million; those evicted forcefully are about 15 million; those within the European Union 4.1 million; those displaced annually due to climatic events are 22 million; those living in adequate housing conditions are 1.6 billion and those living in informal settlements are 883 million (Chiluba et al., 2021 ). These statistics reveal a growing problem globally, although more acutely in Sub-Saharan Africa. Homelessness implications include lacking some basic human rights such as health care, education, privacy (decent housing), clothing, employment, and social security (Casey & Stazen, 2021 ; Chiluba et al., 2021 ). The homeless mainly suffer from poor health (mortality), poverty (inability to earn basic income and other elements for survival), hunger, lacking access to education, clean water, sanitation, and connectedness. This also contributes to rising inequalities and inhibiting development of sustainable and inclusive cities (Akinluyi & Adedokun, 2014 ; Herner et al., 2018 ) which in turn greatly jeopardizes attainment of the SDGs (Chen et al., 2022 ). For sustainable development, governments should therefore ensure addressing homelessness in most SDG areas.  4.4 Urbanization, poverty, homelessness, and SDGs SDGs are a universal call to action with intensions of eliminating poverty, protecting the planet and attaining shared global peace and prosperity and providing liveable cities  (Chen et al., 2022 ; UN, 2018a, 2018b ). This chapter mainly focuses on SDG 11, which specifically concentrates on urban areas and settings and covers all dimensions of the other 16 SDGs (UN, 2018a, 2018b ). SDG 11 is an urban goal aimed at making cities safe, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable. This makes urbanization go beyond a demographic phenomenon, but also a transformative process for stimulating many global development aspects and a key for international development policy (UN, 2018a, 2018b ). Globally, cities play a key role in attaining all SDGs and that requires promoting sustainable social, economic, and ecological dimensions for guiding the international community toward future sustainable development (Chen et al., 2022 ; Fu et al., 2019 ). They are involved in promoting sustainable planning, innovation, local governance of infrastructure, resource management, and economies (Appio et al., 2019 ), which are key for global sustainable development (Chen et al., 2022 ; Scoones et al., 2020 ). Cities impact directly and indirectly on land and energy use, resource consumption and climate change as they are key in driving industrialization and economic growth and are recognized as innovation and investment hubs. Urban areas remain the strings connecting all SDGs as most of the SDG targets comprise an urban component. For instance, SDG 11.4 recognizes the connection between cities and culture as key in driving and enabling attainment of numerous city related SDG targets. This needs to be mainstreamed across numerous SDG indicators. Urbanization therefore becomes key in enabling rural–urban connections that provide for a balanced territorial development and addressing numerous persistent global challenges including homelessness, climate change, pollution, resilience, and environmental degradation (UN, 2018a, 2018b ; UN-ESC, 2019 ). Since homelessness is one of the crudest manifestations of poverty and inequality (UN-ESC, 2019 ), addressing it greatly contributes to eradicating poverty, ensuring healthy lives and sanitation for all and making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, and resilient. Paradoxically, homelessness is absent from SDGs which greatly jeopardizes the attainment of almost all the 17 Goals. Considering that what gets measured is what gets done, not mentioning homelessness in the SDGs would make the homeless to continually remain ignored, unattended to and left behind in pushing for progress (Casey & Stazen, 2021 ; UN, 2018a, 2018b ; UNDP, 2018 ). SDG 11 focusing on sustainable cities and communities has usually been considered to be vital for sustainable urbanization (Akuraju et al., 2020 ; Ghani et al., 2021 , pp. 1–28). Numerous studies (Anwar et al., 2022 ; He et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2022 ; Zhao et al., 2022 ) have confirmed that urbanization connotation and scope of action go beyond SDG11 and have interactions with all other SDGs (Chen et al., 2022 ; Fu et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, several studies have examined the interactions between specific areas and SDGs (Fu et al., 2019 ), including environmental, hygiene, energy systems (Parikh et al., 2021 ), food security (Giannetti et al., 2020 ), climate action, and ecological security (Maes et al., 2019 ). As a complex systemic process of urban-rural transformation, urbanization, involves various components including, humans, environment, technology, land, and management (Chen et al., 2022 ; Chua et al., 2019 ; Wang, 2020 ). A cursory glance at the current state of cities in Sub-Saharan Africa clearly show that the inspirations of SDG 11 are far from being met. As noted above, many lack basic infrastructural facilities, have high incidence of poverty, and are growing more uncoordinated and informally. Changing the current trajectory therefore requires a serious relook at how African governments are domesticating the provisions of SDG 11.    5 Urbanization, poverty, and homelessness in Zambia This chapter uses Zambia as a case study in order to contextualize the above discussion. It thus shows that Zambia has been grappling with the twin problems of urbanization and poverty resulting in challenges of homelessness for the majority in urban areas, such as in the cities of Lusaka, Kitwe, Ndola, and Livingstone. This homelessness is particularly evidenced in the rapid growth of unplanned settlements in the last 2 decades. In order to achieve SDGs 1 and 11, these trends need to be reversed. 5.1 Status of Zambian cities and population growth trends Zambian cities serve as key market locations and service hubs. They play diverse economic roles that add value in specific sectors and have been greatly impacting the economic landscape, fostering economic growth, structural transformation, and poverty reduction. For instance, cities contributed about 83% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2015. These economic activities are mainly concentrated in cities, with the Copperbelt Province contributing 30% of GDP, Lusaka Province 27%, and Southern Province 10% (World Bank, 2022 ). The key economic activities in the four cities include tourism (Livingstone), real estate and construction (Lusaka), and copper mining (Kitwe and Ndola). Cities thus assist in improving household welfare and lowering poverty by providing market access and service hubs for their neighboring towns. For instance, the level of consumption for Zambian households living beyond 2 hours' distance from the closest city (with a population size of 100,000) is 40% lower than those living less than 30 min away (World Bank, 2022 ). The level of welfare in highly dense areas is also 21% higher than that of less populated areas. For example, densely populated areas with better large markets connectivity have better access to core public services, lower poverty levels (World Bank, 2022 ), human capital, higher labor productivity, higher portion of employees in nonfarm and higher wage jobs (60% compared to 20% in least populated areas) contrary to those distant low-density and poorly connected areas (World Bank, 2022 ). Furthermore, cities have been drivers of Zambia's economic growth and consequently poverty reduction. For instance, there has been a significant drop in poverty levels in cities between 2010 and 2015, with the largest drop in Lusaka (by 7.1%), followed by other urban areas (4.6%) and a modest decrease in rural areas (by 1.6%) (World Bank, 2022 ). Clearly, cities are an important part of the country's economic survival; and so are its linkages to the surrounding rural districts. In terms of population, Zambia is among the most urbanized countries in Sub-Saharan African (Chiluba et al., 2021 ). Based on the observed and projected population, as well as spatial growth of cities, Zambia's future is anticipated to be urban. For instance, over the past 2 decades, Zambia's urban population has grown from 9.89 million in 2000 to the current estimate of 19.42 million (Data from: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators/ ). It is thus estimated that by 2030, nearly half (48%) of the Zambian population will live in cities; this is anticipated to increase to 60% by 2050 (UN-DESA, 2014 ; World Bank, 2022 ). The implication is that the challenges of poverty and homelessness have an upward trajectory, if no major actions are taken. This again speaks to the need for the Zambian government to relook at the implementation of SDGs in the urban areas, particularly number 11.   5.2 Urbanization and poverty Zambia, with a GNI per Capita of US$1,348World Economic Outlook database: April 2022 IMF Zambia—Country Data from: https://IMF.org, is classified as one of the poor countries in the World. Thus, despite rapid growth of cities, regional spatial disparities in poverty and population growth have remained evident across the country. Copperbelt and Lusaka regions have lowest poverty rates while Luapula and Western have highest rates (World Bank, 2022 ). It is therefore clear that urbanization and economic activities have not sufficiently translated into overall national economic development and poverty reduction. Thus, regardless of numerous anticipated benefits of urbanization, current evidence shows that if unmanaged, it can lead to a number of negative consequences such as increased poverty and homelessness. It is worth noting that the current status is that of increased urban population with no corresponding increase in gainful employment; with many finding their livelihoods in informal business activities. The results are poverty and homelessness. In other words, the urban poor start failing to pay for necessities including housing, health care, education, food, and childcare. The issues of underemployment and unemployment are argued to be central causes of homelessness in developing countries including Zambia (Chiluba et al., 2021 ; Herner et al., 2018 ). This in turn greatly negatively affects the attainment of SDGs (Chen et al., 2022 ).  5.3 Housing informality and service delivery challenges Seventy percent of Zambia's population is estimated to live in informal settlements and 90% of the labor force is employed in the informal sector (ILO, 2019 ). This makes housing informality and service delivery challenges important facets of homelessness. Despite the fact that Zambian cities are growing and attracting rural population, this growth has mainly been informal, which exacerbates vulnerability to disasters and hamper sustainable development (UN-DESA, 2014 ). Rapid, unmanaged, and underfinanced urbanization has resulted in housing crises in cities and consequently high levels of housing informality and severe service delivery challenges in that infrastructure growth is unable to meet the population growth and increased services demand. This is evident in Lusaka, Kitwe, Ndola, and Livingstone, with a similar trend in some smaller cities (World Bank, 2022 ). The challenges of inadequate investment in housing and infrastructure are clearly visible in the major cities of Zambia where land for development is often allocated without support services (Mushinge et al., 2022 ). In many instances, the construction of houses commences without full services on sites (Munshifwa et al., 2017 ). Thus, newly opened up development areas are often characterized with acute service delivery challenges resulting in lack of basic services including water, solid waste management, sewerage and electricity, as well as increased vulnerability and insecurity of tenure. In many such cases, construction is undertaken largely through individual initiatives which at times so not even meet the urban development standards, hence defeating the inspirations of creating “liveable communities” as envisaged under SDG 11. It is argued that lacking affordable, safe, and stable housing has been the greatest direct cause of homelessness countrywide. However, discrimination also inhibits access to housing, employment, and justice among other helpful services (UN-Habitat, 2020 ). This greatly negatively affects the attainment of the SDGs. Based on SDG11, addressing this requires promoting prosperous,  inclusive and resilient urban settlements, as indicated in the draft National Urbanization Policy (2021–30) and territorial development which is more balanced (World Bank, 2022 ).  5.4 Vulnerability to effects of climate change One of the concomitant effects of homelessness is increased vulnerability to the effects of climate change such as flooding. In other words, rapid urban growth has been spreading to unsafe areas. Over time, unplanned settlements have expanded into flood prone area, increasing the risk for settlers. For instance, Ref. Nchito (2007)  reported two settlements, Mutendere and Kalikiliki which at the time were separated by a stream and prone to flooding. In most cities, entire areas previously seen as marshlands and catchment areas for the stream are now by both formal and informal housing development. Following heavy rains during the current 2022/23 season (December to April), most media reports carried pictures of overflooded settlements, washed away bridges, and displacement of people. The result has been increased vulnerability to flood including increased prevalence of diarrheal diseases (Kabinga, 2016 ).   6 Government strategies for sustainable urbanization and housing The preceding sections show an immediate need for government to devise strategies to manage urbanization, which should include addressing homelessness. Regardless of the extension of social programs and numerous government strides aimed at addressing urbanization and associated homelessness, it still remains rampant in Zambia due to high poverty levels, inadequate housing, and discrimination (Herner et al., 2018 ; UN-Habitat, 2020 ). In line with the SDGs, the Zambian Government has outlined some urban sector priorities in the eighth National Development Plan which are aimed at addressing national housing issues including land policy and urban planning; decentralization and service delivery; climate change and disaster risk management; private sector development; job creation and microsmall and medium enterprises (MSMEs) (GRZ, 2022 ). These are planned to be achieved through the following three main urban policies which are aimed at providing a clear understanding of the role urbanization plays in inclusive, sustainable and resilient national growth and specify urban sector aspirations for the nation (World Bank, 2022 ), these include1. Draft National Urbanization Policy (2021–30) —aimed at promoting prosperous, inclusive, and resilient urban settlements. The draft policy recognizes the link between urbanization and its negative effects, hence the need for the development of liveable and “resilient” urban settlements.  2. National Lands Policy —visualizing a transparent land administration and management system for inclusive sustainable development by the year 2035. As noted earlier, the development of housing and related infrastructure is often in ecologically sensitive areas because of the land allocation systems. This policy therefore aims for a more transparent system which recognizes sustainability in urban development.  3. National Housing Policy (2020–24) —aimed at facilitating the provision of sustainable, decent, and affordable housing for all socioeconomic groups in Zambia. This chapter  also pointed to the serious challenges in the provision of decent housing, resulting in the rapid growth of informal settlement. This Housing Policy recognizes these challenges and propose some policy measures to deal with them.    These three examples provide direction on the thinking of government in dealing with urbanization, poverty, and housing. They also reveal intentions of incorporating sustainability aspects in policies with emphasis on prosperity, inclusivity, resilience, transparency, and decency; all important facets of “sustainable cities and communities.” It is, however, important to note that experience across Africa shows that formulation of policies is often not the problem but their implementation. This chapter thus asserts that it is a coordinated and multi-sectoral implementation approach which will help in reducing homelessness by improving the quality of life through greater opportunities for employment, social services modern facilities and provision of sustainable and inclusive housing infrastructure. However, rapid and unmanaged urbanization greatly contributes to homelessness mainly through its negative effects including poverty and housing crisis. On the other hand, high levels of homelessness might escalate poverty levels (Chiluba et al., 2021 ; Herner et al., 2018 ; UN-Habitat, 2020 ; World Bank, 2022 ; ZSA, 2020 ; ZSA et al., 2019 ). With regards to the interaction among urbanization, homelessness and SDGs, studies suggest that urbanization is one of the greatest contributors of homelessness, which in turn greatly affects the attainment of SDGs. Urbanization has been found to be greatly linked with all the 17 SDGs and about 151 (89%) of their targets respectively. Such relations include topics such as: poverty eradication, infrastructure, energy consumption, international cooperation and environmental protection based on SDGs 11 (sustainable cities and communities); 15 (life on land); and 12 (responsible consumption and production). Although there is no direct interaction between urbanization and SDGs 4 (Quality education) and 5 (Gender equality), homelessness affects all SDGs targets. This suggests that urbanization and its associated homelessness greatly contribute to and might worsen the achievement of SDGs targets which determine the sustainability of the actual development path of cities/regions respectively (Zhao et al., 2022 ). The stronger relational effects on SDGs suggest urbanization to be one of the greatest effective controls in attainment of SDGs (Chen et al., 2022 ) provides a useful framing of the interaction between urbanization and SDGs which are discussed under four dimensions, namely: public health and social welfare; economic growth and energy consumption; natural resource use and ecological/environmental impacts; and international cooperation for development. This chapter adopts this topography and extends it to include poverty and homelessness within the Zambian environment (see Fig. 3.1  ). This framework posits that there is a link between urbanization, poverty, homelessness, and the attainment of most SDGs, as discussed in the following subsections. 6.1 Public health and social welfare equality Zambia is reported to be one of the most urbanized countries at 43%. Rapid and unmanaged urbanization generates numerous problems including high urban poverty, inadequate housing, medical and public hygiene infrastructure which has greatly contributed to high homelessness levels among the urban poor (Chen et al., 2022 ). This has consequently led to growth of informal settlements which lack safe drinking water, public sanitation, and  face high poverty and environmental pollution levels thereby threatening public health in cities (Aliu et al., 2021 ). Such settlements in Zambian cities currently house about 70% of national urban population (World Bank, 2022 ); with challenges of poor health and unequal social facilities. Globally, informal settlements dwellers exceeded one billion in 2020 and about 85% of them were mostly in Central and South Asia (359 million), East and Southeast Asia (306 million), and Sub-Saharan Africa (230 million) (Sachs et al., 2022 ). In line with the SDGs, managed and sustainable urbanization, as well as effective governance, provides better opportunities for employment, income, resources and improved access to health and education facilities and investment in infrastructure including housing. This helps in reducing levels of homelessness (Chiluba et al., 2021 ; Herner et al., 2018 ) and improves public health and life expectancy of urban dwellers (Liu et al., 2017 ). Globally, apart from Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a negative correlation between urbanization and adult mortality.  6.2 Economic growth and energy consumption One of the clear indicators of unmanaged urbanization is the high rate of unemployment in urban areas. For instance, Zambia's unemployment level stands at 64% with most of the available jobs being of low-productivity and informal (World Bank, 2022 ). Globally, 6.2% of the population lacked employment in 2021 due to Covid-19 compared to 5.4% before the pandemic (Sachs et al., 2022 ). Pressing emphasis on sustainable urbanization and housing would help in realizing green economic development and a clean energy (Chen et al., 2022 ). Managed urbanization also accelerates economic development through increasing energy consumption scale and growth as well as addressing energy inefficiencies through dense spatial forms and population (Chen et al., 2022 ). SDGs also assert that managed urbanization helps in provision of clean and green energy, decent work as well as industrialization, innovation and adequate related infrastructure. However, unmanaged urbanization negatively affects energy consumption due to overcrowding especially in informal settlements (resulting from homelessness) and greater demand for energy. For instance, only about 21% of Lusaka households have access to electricity and 16% of households in other urban areas (World Bank, 2022 ) and over 700 million of the global population lacked access to electricity in 2020, out of which over three-quarters lived in Sub-Saharan Africa (Sachs et al., 2022 ).   6.3 Natural resource use and ecological/environmental impacts Unmanaged and rapid urbanization and its associated homelessness and unemployment has resulted in growth of informal settlements extending into unsafe, flood prone areas thereby increasing the intensity and frequency of harmful flood events which exacerbates the effects of climate change. Ref. Munshifwa et al. (2021)  show allocation of land in ecologically sensitive areas in the cities of Kitwe and Ndola. This results in environmental and ecological degradation and climate change, consequently increasing disaster risks, especially flood related (He et al., 2022 ; Liu et al., 2017 ). Urban development planning should emphasize sustainable urbanization which is inclusive of functional ecosystem services and biodiversity value for urban resilience (Chen et al., 2022 ).  6.4 International cooperation for development SDGs consider urbanization as a key developmental tool aligned with 2030 agenda. Hence, it supports international cooperation for development as evidenced in the past in squatter upgrading projects. Since urbanization-associated homelessness is one of the crudest manifestations of poverty and inequality (UN-ESC, 2019 ), international cooperation might help in bridging high inequalities and adaptive capacity among developing countries, like Zambia, consequently aiding attainment of SDGs (Zhao et al., 2022 ). It also helps in addressing specific urbanization barriers in attainment of SDGs, eliminating and mitigating urban adaptation risk factors and linking global and local perspectives. Sustainable urbanization and housing development requires international collaborative governance in reconciling environmental, social and needs for economic development issues (Chen et al., 2022 ).   7 Recommendations This chapter has shown that urbanization is one of greatest contributors of homelessness in cities. Furthermore, urbanization and its associated homelessness greatly affect the attainment of most of the SDGs. Transforming Zambian cities and attaining SDGs require focusing attention on sustainable urbanization and housing for improved public welfare through policy reforms and targeted investments. This entails prioritization and collaboration among various key government ministries as well as international cooperation (Chen et al., 2022 ; World Bank, 2022 ). This chapter therefore recommends four reform areas and their respective priority areas as follows:1. Urban planning:  Planning provides a framework within which urbanization and economic growth can be managed. For instance, the Urban and Regional Planning Act of 2015 stipulates that all Local Authorities should prepare Integrated Development Plans (IDPs), which are broad instruments for capturing issues related to social, economic, and environmental. The state of Zambian cities currently shows failure in this aspect.  2. Land service delivery and housing:  The rapid growth of informal settlements is a manifestation of failure of the formal system to provide services and housing for the growing urban population (Ephraim Kabunda Munshifwa, 2019 ). This is acknowledged  in both the National Land Policy and the National Housing Policy, however implementation of remedial measures is lacking.  3. Urban land administration:  Just like planning, an effective land administration system supports economic development in many ways, including by clearly defining property rights, increased land asset accumulation and improved real estate and land markets operation. Challenges with the computerized land management system at the Ministry of Lands has resulted in numerous problems on the land including corruption, illegal allocations, etc. (Mushinge et al., 2022 ).  4. Sustainable urban practices:  Integration of sustainable urban practices will greatly assist cities in the management of current challenges. For instance, this calls for the halting of allocations in ecologically sensitive areas and encouraging more nature-based solutions to the treats of climate change.     8 Conclusions This chapter was aimed at investigating urbanization, poverty, and homelessness in lights of the SDGs. The chapter focused on the major cities in Zambia (Lusaka, Kitwe, Ndola, and Livingstone). The study found a strong relationship between urbanization, poverty, and homelessness. It thus argued that sustainable urbanization improves economic conditions and living standards for urban dwellers, consequently reducing homelessness while unmanaged and rapid urbanization generates numerous problems including high poverty levels and inadequate housing which greatly contribute to homelessness and the concomitant effects of environmental degradation, poor health and safety standards, vulnerability to disasters, etc.   References Adetokunbo and Emeka, 2015 I.
