                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also called the 2030 Agenda, introduce a new development agenda focused on long-term articulated solutions. The agenda has adopted an inclusive and transversal project, which considers girls and women as essential to achieve sustainable development. Amongst their 17 goals, SDG 5 addresses gender equality and female empowerment. This paper emphasises SDG 5 and, more specifically, the 5.5 goal, which concerns female participation in political and leadership spheres. This research aims to indicate the female empowerment advances through the initial mapping of initiatives related to female representation in power spheres underway in South America. The methodology includes documentary and bibliographic research, supported by empirical data. The paper is structured into five sections: a historical review about development agendas, feminisms critical approaches, strategies to subvert gender inequalities in politics, other gender-sensitive public policies, and analysis of SDG 5 advances. The results point out gender is far away from parity, despite recent slight advances in South America. In addition, the increase of women in politics is seen as primordial to achieve gender equality.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also called the 2030 Agenda, introduce a new development agenda focused on long-term articulated solutions. The agenda has adopted an inclusive and transversal project, which considers girls and women as essential to achieve sustainable development. Amongst their 17 goals, SDG 5 addresses gender equality and female empowerment. This paper emphasises SDG 5 and, more specifically, the 5.5 goal, which concerns female participation in political and leadership spheres. This research aims to indicate the female empowerment advances through the initial mapping of initiatives related to female representation in power spheres underway in South America. The methodology includes documentary and bibliographic research, supported by empirical data. The paper is structured into five sections: a historical review about development agendas, feminisms critical approaches, strategies to subvert gender inequalities in politics, other gender-sensitive public policies, and analysis of SDG 5 advances. The results point out gender is far away from parity, despite recent slight advances in South America. In addition, the increase of women in politics is seen as primordial to achieve gender equality.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  South America  Political participation  Gender-sensitive public policies  Gender equality    Introduction The ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ was launched by United Nations (UN) in 2015, with the support of the 193 UN member States, multilateral and civil society organisations, in substitution to the ‘Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) (2000–2015). Inscribed in an Action Plan to ‘Change the World’, the new development Agenda brings together 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), unfolded into 169 goals. Amongst these goals, the paper focuses on SDG 5, which encompass gender equality and female empowerment, besides the elimination of all forms of discrimination, violence, and abusive practices against women and girls; the guarantee of sexual and reproductive rights; and full participation in political, economic, and public life. Specifically, we are concern about gender equality in politics based on goal 5.5 (SDG 5): “ensure the full and effective participation of women and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life” [1 ]. Through the adoption of an inclusive and transversal project for women and girls, Machado Filho [2 ] affirms that goal 5.5 has the purpose of ensure women's equal participation in decision-making processes and their access to power in male-dominated spheres. So, does the women's participation at all levels of politics increase the formulation and approval of gender-sensitive public policies in South American countries? To answer this question, the methodology is composed by bibliographical and documental research. Looking to mapping the enlargement of female representation in power spheres and the impact of their political participation in gender-sensitive public policies, the resources used were statistical databases, institutional documents, and reports from national, regional, and international organisations. The paper is structured into five sections. The first brings a historical review about the main characteristics of Latin American development agendas and examines the focuses used to ensure women's rights and gender equality. The second one explores the questions and explanations offered by feminisms critical approaches to the absence of women from public spaces and, therefore, from the political sphere, referring to the South American case. The third one covers the strategies used by feminists to subvert gender inequalities and enlarge women's political participation in South America, emphasising the adoption of gender quotas and parity as mechanisms to potentialise their participation. The fourth one links SDG 5 - and other international and regional tools - to the approval of public policies that increased the presence of women in national parliaments and, therefore, to the formulation of more gender-sensitive public policies. The fifth and last section analyses the practical effects of gender equality proposed by SDG 5 through women's political participation. Thereby, we will examine how issues relating to gender equality are introduced into the context of public policies and incorporated into development agendas.  Gender issues in development agendas The Sustainable Development Goals and the regional gender agenda pose major challenges so that, from the construction and consolidation of an inclusive State, public policies of equality that are characterised by innovation and quality are generated ([3 ]:249). For a long time, development agendas had associated women with the private sphere and included them in government policies based on the feminine attributes of motherhood and caring for others. In peripheral countries, this notion revalidates the colonial legacy and marginalises the heritage of native populations. Such limits prioritise care approaches of a stereotyped and patriarchal nature to associate women with development. The pressure to include women subjects in public policies produces a set of discourses and practices aimed at facing the daily problems of the female segment. From this perspective, we share the critique of decolonial debates from feminist and anti-racist points of view to monitor how aspects relevant to women have been integrated into development agendas until reaching the gender equality approach, advocated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In Latin American's case, we can trace this path from the mid-twentieth century. Women have become welfare approaches’ target because their reproductive role, which is the main reference of women's policies. They had reinforced women's role as mothers and wives, that is, they turned to areas such as education, health, nutrition, family planning, and home economics [4 ]. The diversity amongst women in terms of class, ethnic origin, age, sexual orientation, and other inequalities were not even considered. The result is that women are still conceived “as recipients of welfare programs and not as subjects of development and citizens with full rights” ([5 ]:21). From the second half of the twentieth century, the struggle for human rights and against the dictatorship in South American countries mobilised a significant part of the female segment and was led by it. In this framework, feminisms brought to light the questions and demands of the future agenda of gender public policies. Initially organised in small groups of reflection and, later, in numerous networks, collective organisations, or thematic, action, and identity groups, Latin American feminisms promoted expressive and innovative forms of articulation. In this tone, transnational dynamics were undertaken with the formation of a growing feminist calendar [5 ]. According to Valente [6 ], feminisms were not the only ones amongst the ‘new’ social movements to confront the historical logics of exclusion and subordination or to present proposals and demand citizen recognition. Feminisms also demanded specific rights and knew how to produce new ones. In the last decade of the twentieth century, all social movements were required to elaborate strategies to face the content of a State agenda guided by the modernisation logic of neoliberal economic. This period had generated simultaneously new opportunities and vulnerabilities [7 ]. This is particularly apparent in the technological domain, as noted by Di Vaio, Hassan, and Palladino [8 ]. They contend that there has been insufficient emphasis on gender equality. Additionally, technological innovation has the potential to intensify the marginalization and inequality faced by women, particularly in developing and underdeveloped countries. The authors advocate that technology should ideally contribute to nurturing the development of more democratic institutions, thereby establishing a protective environment for the rights of individual human beings. As Santos [4 ] clarifies, although the gender perspective acquires a certain expression in government programs, the conditions for equal treatment between women and men are still unfavourable. From an institutional perspective, external pressures related to gender equality have the potential to prompt governmental entities to adapt their decisions in an attempt to legitimise them [8 ]. Despite recent advancements in reshaping legal and social norms, they remain somewhat insufficient. However, this ongoing transformation stands as a means to encourage the active participation of women in sectors historically dominated by men, including the realm of political decision-making [9 ]. Yet, a noteworthy observation is the “tendency to technocratise the gender perspective, that is, to use the concept as a merely technical instrument” ([4 ]:83). Such an approach poses a significant challenge, potentially undermining the empowerment of women, given that the practical implementation of their equal rights often falls short. On the other hand, the 1990s concretised a development agenda in which social issues had assumed centrality with the support of State actors, international organisations, and feminist movements. The international commitment to equality has brought to light the reality of discrimination against women in different spheres of public and private life. Two perspectives on how to interpret inequalities between the sexes and to act on them came into dispute: the Women in Development and the Gender in Development approach. The first one was composed of a strict view of women, while the second one placed them as subjects of rights and brought out the imperative of projecting gender equality into all development agendas. This debate is widely dealt with by feminist literature, but it is important to make here a brief overview of the sequence of events in which the idea of prioritising the gender focus in the sustainable development plan took place. In summary, we can start with the First Conference of the International Year of Women (Mexico, 1975), through the institution of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, 1979) and the Second World Conference on Women (Copenhagen, 1980), until arriving at the Third World Conference to close the Decade for Women (1976–1985). The last one aimed at reviewing the diagnoses of UN State members on their achievements in the ‘Decade for Women: Equality, Development, and Peace’ (Nairobi, 1985) [10 ]. In addition, the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995) leveraged the lessons learned from the three previous events. The ideas of female empowerment and gender equality accompanied the constitution of political agendas for development. In parallel, women's issues are connected to these agendas. So, we can include the World Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), also called Rio 92, where women's rights were expanded and included in the design of development projects. In 2012, the edition of the World Conference on Sustainable Development, the so-called Rio+20, converged with the development proposals for the post-2015 based on the lessons brought with the implementation of the MDGs. In the sequence listed, Rio+20 had a double meaning. On the one hand, it established the conditions for promoting sustainability with the adaptation of a new development agenda. On the other hand, it qualified UN Women regarding the role of this body to promote the empowerment of women and gender equality [11 ]. The same event had established the basis for the articulation of the new global development policy. In summary, the international articulation designed since 1975 provides for the inclusion of gender subjects in two global agendas: the MDGs, and the SDGs. From the lessons learned from the MDGs, the 2030 Agenda innovates by combining universality and focalisation. In this context, the political commitment of each country, government, and their social actors is imperative to welcome political actions projected globally. In the South American context, the contribution revolves around the achievement of an agenda aimed at committing national States to generate gender equality projected by the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. In the Latin America and the Caribbean case, the formatting of the Regional Gender Agenda considers the best way to integrate local, national, and regional interests. This agenda is a product of agreements, declarations, and consensuses established by the States of the region and their commitments to act politically to guarantee and protect women's human rights, avoid discrimination against them, and face gender inequalities. This reflects an ongoing process, initiated with the elaboration of the Regional Action Plan for the Integration of Women in Economic and Social Development in Latin America (Havana, 1977), which brings together political will and women and feminists’ articulation, as well as the contribution of the UN. Therefore, it is important to ensure that gender equality and women's empowerment agendas - as well as the SDGs - are aligned to the regional commitments to avoid overlaps and duplication [12 ]. Because of this, the agreements signed at the regional and global levels must be complementary, and the actions to fulfil them must be articulated with the commitments defined in both agendas. Even so, the achievements of these commitments bump into a history of difficulties in seeking gender equality and women's autonomy, in physical, economic, and decision-making terms. Meanwhile, these limitations qualify feminist political theories and practices and offer a unique opportunity to leverage women and girls’ issues in the Regional Gender Agenda and the 2030 Agenda.  Resistances and feminist critical approaches The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development refers to common global needs: it is up to each region, country, and even locality to adapt to its Objectives, as well as the understanding that these are guidelines to the formulation of policies to improve the lives of the global population. In the South American case, the full implementation of 5.5 goal of SDG 5 permeates the understanding that the reality of the subcontinent is marked by a historical absence of women from public life since the colonisation. As denounced by Paredes and Guzmán [13 ], this phenomenon is one of the expressions of the patriarchal/colonial pact established between colonisers European men and colonised indigenous men. The indigenous women were the first to be affected by the modification of their traditions and stereotyping about their bodies and tasks. Sexual abuse and slavery were a reality of South American indigenous women's lives in the colonial period. Miscegenation with indigenous women was encouraged, promoting their role as reproductive and sexually active. So, staying at home was the rule - taking care of their children - instead of returning to the routine before colonisation, which involved participation in decision-making [14 ]. The reproduction of European patriarchal practices and traditions after America's colonisation highlights that the sexual division of labour was extended to indigenous women and, later, to the enslaved African women. The comprehension of the limits imposed on women by colonialism, capitalism, and patriarchy are reflected in the solutions offered to decrease inequalities and asymmetries between genders [15 ]. In this context, the existence of gender-sensitive public policies is a need to fight inequalities through the institutionalisation of women's rights. Nações Unidas [1 ] understands that gender equality is one of the elements required for development - being part of the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Situating the debate in the field of political gender equality, we argue that including women in public, economic, and political life is not enough to make progress on women's political condition. According to Araújo [[16 ]:207], “the theme of [political] participation is much broader than its dimension of representation”. Further, Lugones [17 ] warns that the legacies of the ‘modern-colonial gender system’ do not allow the existence of a full women's participation in public life, as claimed by goal 5.5 of the SDGs. The historical roots of female oppression in South America have not been solved with the advent of globalisation. Thus, women are still silenced, needing the State to act ‘in their favour’ - a State created and maintained by patriarchal pillars [18 ]. In Morgan's [19 ] evaluation, public policies to increase women's political participation still depend on a system controlled by men and based on masculine values. Gender-sensitive public policies are a tool that ‘modern’ State must adopt to try to repair the historical damage caused to women in two specific moments: the first one was during the colonisation and the second one after the State creation itself. In both cases, patriarchy - allied to capitalism and colonialism - had ignored half of the population and established gender relations. The idea of a colonial/patriarchal pact, which founded the ‘patriarchy of coloniality’, is reinforced precisely by a social/sexual contract. Pateman [[20 ]:2] warns the “[c]ontract is far from being opposed to patriarchy; contract is the means through which modern patriarchy is constituted”. Both the colonial/patriarchal pact and the social/sexual contract assume the existence of a sexual difference between men and women that must be considered when determining their roles - of subordination of the later ones - in society. The difference between them lies in the idea that the first one was informally established between European colonisers and the indigenous population, while the second one was formally institutionalised in the figure of the modern State. Stearns [21 ] argues that other institutions, such as the Church, were also relevant in changing the gender relations pattern in the subcontinent during colonisation, and as part of the secular State. The elimination of patriarchy, therefore, would not lead to the automatic elimination of other forms of oppression as it goes beyond gender issues: it is based on male hegemony and power relations. For Bidaseca [[15 ]:63], “[s]exism, racism and class exploitation constitute interrelated systems of domination that determine the female agency”. By the way, the believe in single oppression experienced by all women in the world is the main critic to western feminism (heterosexual, white, and bourgeois). There are significant differences amongst the first women called feminists and those who were on the margins of the knowledge produced by Global North academics. Still, that is not merely a geographical issue, as it is imbued with what Crenshaw [22 ] called ‘intersectionalities’. Even in the Global North after the 1980s, black/mestizas scholars as Davis [23 ], hooks [24 ], Collins [25 ] and Anzaldúa [26 ] point out inequalities present in North-American society between white and non-white women, highlight race, class, and other identities were essential categories to think other types of oppression suffered by women - and still do. Some practical effects of intersectionalities are that categorisations have power, and they can also have material and social consequences. For example, several types of research show that stereotypes - mostly sexual ones - related to black and immigrant women encourage violence against them. The awareness acquired by non-white women from Global North who disagreed with the western feminism's generalisation had reflected, maybe simultaneously, the identification process of other intersectionalities that were part of Global South women's reality. According to Gonzáles [27 ], the cultural formation of each location is different, so gender, race, and class relations in one country do not match what is established in other ones. Several complications can influence the formation process of culture, and colonialism is the most evident aspect in South America, but not the only one. It brought elements that shape social relations in the subcontinent to this day. Yet, the history of the region traditionally told does not have women - whether indigenous, black, or white - as active characters. Wet nurses, black mothers, housewives, mulattos, maids, cooks, prostitutes: that is what women are in South American history. The more decentralised academic movement was initiated by postcolonial authors as Spivak [28 ] and Mohanty [29 ]. The continued practice of stereotyping a ‘Third World woman’ was responsible for academic colonisation of Western white women towards ‘others’, taking away their agency, specifics, and freedom. If in the Global North the conquest of an academic spot took centuries, the knowledge production called scientific by Third World women is still questioned and sometimes it requires external validation. Advances on gender studies in South America come, in the first instance, from the debates amongst Quijano [30 ], Mignolo [31 ], and Grosfoguel [32 ]. Later, Lugones [17 ], Matos [33 ], Bidaseca [15 ], Segato [34 ], Paredes and Guzmán [13 ], for example, have problematised the writings of their pairs and explain the diversity of South American feminist thought. Despite some divergences in approach and intensity of criticism, one point of convergence is that the South American – indigenous and black - women did not accept the oppression generated by the colonial/patriarchal pact without offering resistance. Nowadays, South American women are still struggle against exclusion arising from the social/sexual contract. Furthermore, the notion of intersectionality used by decolonial feminists - or descolonial, in Lugones's [17 ] case - is imbued by the perception that the category of ‘woman’ is a fallacy and, therefore, deserves to be always rethought in the plural: women, feminisms, struggles. Thereby, the heterogeneity of the movement and the uniqueness of its demands are reinforced. The subversion of the roles assigned to women by the patriarchy of coloniality and, thus, the end of the patriarchy of modernity is the ultimate goal of these feminisms, which is reinforced on the political level. Finally, we turn our attention to the strategies used by women to subvert gender inequalities in politics.  Strategies of women's political participation Increasing women's political participation demanded institutional strategies such as the gender electoral quota system, a minimal percentage of women candidates to ensure female representativeness and a critical mass in politics. However, some countries did not have yet any type of quota, and amongst those with quota legislation, there are distinctions between measures and results. The difference lies in the social-economic and cultural specificities of each State, which have been shaping according to the gender modern-colonial system. In South America, the gender quota's first adoption was in 1991, by Argentina (Law 24,012). Still in the 1990s, Paraguay1  1 Legislation valid only for political parties’ primary elections.   (Law 834/1996), Bolivia (Law 1779/1997), Brazil (Law 9504/1997), Ecuador (1997), Peru (Law 26,859/1997), and Venezuela (in Spanish Ley Orgánica de Sufragio y Participación Política /1997) also adopted it. In the 21th century, it was the turn of Uruguay (Law 18,476/2009), Colombia (Law 1475/2011), and Chile (Law 20,840/2015). Only Suriname does not have gender quotas in the South American region, and Guyana has 30% seat reservation (Representation of People's Act/2000). The minimal percentage established initially by most of the countries’ legislation was 30%, except in Chile (40%), Paraguay (20%), and Brazil (20%) [35–45 ]. Another strategy is the parity law, which aimed to balance political participation between men and women, establishing 50% of candidates to each sex. Ecuador was a pioneer to update its legislation in 2000, establishing progressive addition of 5% each electoral process until parity - Electoral Law updated in 2009 reinforced it [40 ]. In 2004, Bolivia adopted Law 2771 establishing the mandatory 50% of female candidates at all levels of political representation. In 2010, the Law 26 established gender parity at all electoral levels, including political parties [46 ,47 ]. Venezuela (Resolution n° 080,721–658/2008), Argentina (Law 27,412/2017) and Peru2 There will be a progressive increase in the percentage of electoral quotas, which will go from 30% to 40% in the 2021 elections, 45% in 2026, and 50% in 2031.  2   (Law 30,996/2019) complete the South America countries list with electoral parity [48–50 ]. In Brazil, the Law Project 1984/2019 predicts candidates’ parity list by gender; if approved, it will change the current quota legislation of 30% [51 ]. Table 1   summarises this information, highlighting the quota adoption's year, the existence of mandatory and the minimum percentage, as well its updates, when it is the case. Beyond the existence or not of electoral gender quotas, parity or not, the effects of this mechanism related to the effectiveness of female presence in South American politics deserve attention. In Fig. 1   we note Bolivia is the country best represented by women: 46.2% in lower House and 55.6% in upper Chamber. These numbers put Bolivia as the South American country with the best indicators, and also in the eleventh place worldwide in female parliament participation. Despite positive data, Bolivia has decreased its numbers, since it already had occupied the third position in worldwide ranking after the 2014 elections (53.1% of women in lower House and 47.2% in upper Chamber at that time). Argentina also stands out with about 40% of female representation in each legislative house, a percentage similar to Ecuador. Brazil and Paraguay have the worst indicators amongst all countries in the region: both have 15% in the lower House, and Brazil has 12.4% in upper Chamber - even with the existence of the Brazilian gender quota of 30% since 2009 and the Paraguayan one of only 20% since 1996 [55 ]. Therefore, according to the information presented in Table 1  and Fig. 1 , just Bolivia is fulfilling the quotas established. The mere existence of a policy does not mean the guarantee of its implementation and, even less, of its possible practical effectiveness. In the Brazilian case, as in many others, the gender quota law does not produce effective results because of the lack of interest by the political establishment. Thus, Brazilian political parties have been filled the quota established percentage with ‘ghost’ female candidates, as a way to avoid competition for political protagonism. According to Calheiros, Brasil, and Ignácio [[56 ]:2], a ‘ghost’ candidate refers to the candidate “[…] without the intention of running, with targets that may be irregular, such as embezzle money from the electoral fund”. In the case of female applications, it is a way for political parties to fulfil the gender quota law without affecting the traditional political scenario. About complementary policies to the quota legislation, we could list the campaign financing and electoral advertising time. The way that both measurements are established impacts the increase of female applications and, therefore, the election of these women. According to Sacchet [[57 ]:161], “[…] the electoral system itself is a key variable to explain women's electoral performance”. Women tend to be benefited from the Proportional Representation (PR) system, position term, and supervision mechanisms for quota's fulfilment, besides strict application rules by political parties. The greater the application numbers from PR, the more women's chances of election improve significantly, given that in the majority or mixed systems the political parties tend to choose men candidates. The argument is that men have more political capital than women, which would guarantee campaign financing. In those cases, the strategy adopted by political parties is precisely to diversify the candidates’ profiles, to create more opportunities at the elections. Argentina, Guyana, Paraguay, and Uruguay have PR and closed electoral lists. Bolivia and Venezuela have mixed systems: the districts are single names, and PR is a closed list. The other South American countries have PR and open list [58 ]. The position term refers to electoral lists’ compositions, which is the mechanism that certified women will occupy compatible positions in the lists. For example, a 30% gender quota means that at least one woman must occupy one of the three first lists’ positions, and so on. The point is to subvert the logic of putting women at the end of the list, while men are on the top of it. Lastly, Sacchet [57 ] points out fiscalisation as an important aspect of the effectiveness of gender quotas. It is not enough the existence of such a policy if there is no budget nor inherent implementation mechanism. As we can see in Table 2  , South American States (except Venezuela) had adopted sanctions on political parties that did not fulfil the quotas legislation. In addition to informations on Table 2 , some countries have yet other tools to promote female applications and their election. Even without legal provision for funding campaigns for women, Argentina has funds of which at least 30% must be earmarked for activities related to training, promotion, and development of political skills for women inside political parties [59 ]. In Brazil, the Federal Supreme Court (in Portuguese Superior Tribunal Federal  – STF) had guaranteed at least 30% of free advertising time for women [62 ]. Another strategy is seat reservations, which entails a mandatory percentage of elected women [63 ]. Despite being the best way to guarantee elected women in parliaments, it is also the hardest one to be adopted because it is mandatory that women, and not men, take such seats. In South America, Guyana has had legislation ensuring ⅓ seat reservations for women in the lower House since 2000. Nowadays, 35.7% of the legislative seats are occupied by women [41 ,55 ]. In the last decades, the increase of women's participation in politics is undeniable but still incipient. In many cases, the change could be directly, but not exclusively, associated with the existence of gender quotas and other strategies to promote women's participation in politics. It is the correlation between the women's presence or absence in politics and the gender-sensitive public policies’ elaboration that will be explored in the next section.  Achievements in gender-sensitive public policies As Stromquist [64 ], we understand public policies are official declarations about how some public organism intends to deal and act about certain issues. In this paper, intention to act means to achieve gender equality. The gender-sensitive public policies related to violence against women present greater similarities between South American countries and most of them have been adopting such legislation since the 1990s (see Table 3  ). In 2017, Chile had included psychological violence as a crime against women and increased the punishment [65 ]. Ecuador includes physical and psychic protection and women's sexual freedom, and also adopted in 2018 the ‘Integral Organic Law for the Prevention and Eradication of Gender Violence against Women’ [66 ,67 ]. Paraguay's legislation initially was just about physical violence, but domestic violence against the familiar group and psychological violence were later recognised [68–70 ]. Uruguay predicts gender-based violence, and Venezuela recognises violence against women as a public health problem [71 ,72 ]. In Brazilian case, ‘Maria da Penha Law’ is internationally recognised by the creation of a mechanism to prevent, assist and protect women in situation of domestic violence. However, this legislation was not a product of women's presence in politics. Brazil was sentenced by the Organisations of American States (OAS) Inter-American Commission on Human Rights after a complaint by the victim - Maria da Penha Maia Fernandes, to whom the law was named - about Brazilian State omission and neglect related to violence against women [76 ,88 ]. On July 2021, the Law 14,188 was approved, including psychological violence against women as a crime, besides the creation of the program ‘Red Sign’ (in Portuguese Sinal Vermelho ), which provides the letter ‘X’ written on the hand will act as a denunciation signal of ongoing violence [89 ]. While Peru has more restrictive legislation about abortion (authorised only in cases of risk to the pregnant woman's life), the country had advanced the punishment to violence against women in private and public spheres. Peru also had adopted progressive electoral parity [83 ]. Another feminist demand, directly related to gender-based violence, is femicide, which refers to women murdered in the context of domestic violence and/or by the condition of being a woman (gender). Table 4   presents how recently is the criminalisation of femicide in South America, dating from 2010 onwards. Although some countries have achieved higher female political representation in this time, it is possible to connect such legislations to the feminist movements’ demands. As shown in Table 4 , just Guyana and Suriname did not predict femicide as a crime. In the Ecuadorian case, the legislation advances related to gender-based violence and femicide could be seen as an unfolding of electoral parity (2000) and the alternating electoral lists (2009), since the country has reached almost 40% of female political representation in the 2017′s elections. However, there was no effect yet over the abortion legislation - authorised only in cases of rape of women with intellectual disabilities [55 ]. The abortion legislation is one of the most controversial feminist agendas, encountering resistance in South American societies and politics. Suriname is the only country in the region that completely criminalises abortion. In contrast, according to Table 5  , Guyana, Uruguay, and recently Argentina have legalised abortion in all circumstances. The other countries have legislations that criminalise abortion, with some exceptions - in general, abortion is allowed in cases of rape and risk to the pregnant woman's life. Guyana was a pioneer in abortion legalisation, in 1995, even before the establishment of the eligible criteria of ⅓ of women in political parties’ lists. However, the country did fail to effectively promote access to safe abortion by the public health service [41 ]. In 2012, Uruguay was just the second South American country to legalise voluntary pregnancy interruption in all cases [109 ]. In 2018, a law project about pregnancy interruption, by the woman's will, until the 14th week of pregnancy was approved by the Argentinian Lower House, but it was rejected by the Upper Chamber, mainly by pressure from the church and conservative groups. The movement for abortion decriminalisation was led by Argentinian women, and it is also considered an offshoot of the women's increase in politics (from only 5% of the Lower House and the Upper Chamber's seats in the 1990s to 40% in 2019′s elections in both houses) [55 ]. The movement consistency resulted in the approval of the legalisation of abortion on December 30, 2020 by the Upper Chamber and the law enactment on January 14, 2021 by the president Alberto Fernández [104 ]. In Bolivia, an updated of the Penal Code had legalised abortions performed by teenagers at any stage of pregnancy, and abortions performed before 8 weeks of pregnancy by female students, or by the female who has children, elderly people, or people with disabilities under their care, or in extreme poverty situations [100 ]. Further, Bolivia leads the ranking of women's political participation in South America [55 ]. The increase of women in politics may have contributed to the enlargement of legal abortions situations, and may even advance debates on complete abortion decriminalisation. Chile allowed abortion since 1931, but Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship prohibited and criminalised any abortion case in 1989. In 2016, the proposal led by Michelle Bachelet's government (2014–2018), which attend a historical Chilean feminist demand, was approved after two years of Parliament's debates. In 2017, abortion was authorised in three cases: rape, the risk to the pregnant woman's life, and unfeasibility of the foetus [105 ]. In this specific case, the government's - under a woman's leadership - and the women parliamentarians’ support was essential. In mid-January 2021, inspired by the Argentinian movement, the Chilean Lower House had started to debate a project to decriminalise abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy. It is expected to be a long process, however, female parliamentarians point out the urgency that women have a voice in the fight for their sexual and reproductive rights [111 ]. In Colombia, legal abortion cases include risk to the woman's mental health, since a pregnancy against a woman's will is considered psychological suffering. Although Colombian legislation still criminalises abortion, this hiatus allows Colombian women to do the abortion by the public or private health system. In 2020, it was requested to the Constitutional Court the unconstitutionality declaration of the Penal Code's article 122, to legalise abortion [106,112 ]. The advance of such a theme may be a result of the Colombian women's participation increase in politics. Both Paraguay and Venezuela have the most restrictive legislation related to abortion in South America - it is only allowed in case of risk to the pregnant woman's life [70 ,110 ]. About women's political participation, Paraguay has low governmental incentives due to the non-mandatory nature of electoral gender quotas at the national level. Even with the adoption of parity quotas in 2008, the effects were not yet expressive in Venezuela [55 ]. In Brazil, abortion cases are predicted by the Law 2848 of 1940, and by STF's decision of 2012. However, it has been difficult to implement such legislation due to the growing opposition from conservative and religious movements [102 ,103 ]. The low female legislative representation has relation with the fact of abortion has been discussed in the sense to criminalise it in all cases. Indeed, at the end of 2020, the ‘Pregnant Woman Statute’ law project was presented with three main points: article 1 defends ‘unborn child life since conception’, influenced by the evangelical lobby; article 10 determines the parent's right - even if it is the rapist - to the exercise of paternity; and article 11 predicts financial aid to the pregnant woman who was raped. After negative repercussions, those points should be removed from the original text [113 ]. Before concluding, it was elaborated the relation between the international conferences on women, the South American countries’ national legislation on women, and the SDG 5.  SDG 5: gender equality through women's political participation The only cited legislation adopted before the entry into force of CEDAW in 1981 and the Third Conference on Women in 1985 were those relating to partial abortion in seven countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Most gender-sensitive public policies in South America were formulated from the 1990s onwards, already influenced by Rio 92 and the Beijing Platform of 1995. Total abortion in Guyana and partial abortion in Paraguay, as well as practically all laws of quotas and violence against women are in this wake. By establishing a chronology between the approval of these legislations, it is possible to relate the quotas to other gender policies. amongst the eleven countries that have either quotas or seat reservations for women in parliaments, in four of them this law predates the one related to violence against women. However, in Argentina, Paraguay, and Venezuela the difference is less than four years, that is, it is not the gender quotas that theoretically elected women who approve other gender-sensitive public policies. In Brazil, the quota law was approved nine years before the legislation on domestic violence. In five countries, the mandate is four years, in another five it is five years, and in one it is six years. Thus, the electoral cycle for the quota and seat reservation laws to take effect is relatively long when we think about how recent such formal recognition is. Sometimes the question is not how long it will take for the legislation to change women's daily life, however, if it will happen. The most emblematic example is the Femicide Law. Data from Cepalstat [114 ] on nine3  3 There is no data available on Chile, Guyana, and Suriname.   South American countries evidence that in all of them the femicide rate per 100,000 women increased for at least one period since 2014. In Argentina, where the Femicide Law was approved in 2012, the rate was 1 woman in 2014 and from 2015 to 2019 it was 1.1 women. The Bolivian4  4 No data available in 2014.   Law has not changed the fact that the country had the highest femicide rate in the region in 2019: 2.1; yet, in 2018 it reached 2.3, the highest since 2015 (1.8; in 2016 1.9, and 2017 2.0). Despite the 2015 Law, Brazil is the second country with higher femicide rate, and it is increasing every year since 2017, after a small decrease: 2016 1.6; 2017 1.5; 2018 1.7; and 2019 1.8. Since the Femicide Law approval in 2015, Colombian rates had raised from 0.2 in 2016 to 0.8 in 2017 and 0.9 in 2018 and 2019.5  5 Brazil and Colombia had no data available in 2014 and 2015.   In Ecuador, the Law was approved in 2014, a year in which the rate was 0.3. It has increased until 2017: 2015 0.7; 2016 0.8; and 2017 1.2; and decreased in 2018 to 0.7; nonetheless, it increased again to 0.8 in 2019. Paraguayan experience is similar to Ecuadorian. The Law dates from 2016, before that, in 2014 the femicide rate was 1.0 and in 2015 0.7. The rate had started increasing to 1.2 in 2016, 1.6 in 2017, 1.7 in 2018, and finally decreased to 1.0 in 2019. In Peru 0.6 women in 100,000 were victims of femicide in 2015, this rate was 0.7 from 2015 to 2017, 0.9 in 2018, and it decreased slightly to 0.8 in 2019. Uruguayan rates were 1.0, 1.5, and 1.2 in 2014, 2015, and 2016 respectively. In 2017, when the Femicide Law was approved in the country, the rate increased to 1.5 and keep in this direction in 2018, reaching 1.7; however, it decreased to 1.4 in 2019. Venezuela was amongst the South American countries with the lowest femicide rates: 0.5 in 2014, and 0.8 in 2015 and 2016.6  6 Due to the country situation, there is no data available after 2016.   With the example of Femicide Laws and their practical effects, we suggest that the gap between the legislation and the women's reality is still huge in the region. As mentioned, it was in the 1990s that there was a significant advance in the official recognition of women's rights in the region and the number of policies approved during this period reflects the international movements and networks created since the First Conference on Women. Of the sixty-four laws identified by this research, nineteen of them are from the 1990s, corresponding to almost 30% of the total. The first ten years of the new millennium were accompanied by the formulation of laws on violence against women in Brazil and Suriname, and updates on these in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The quota law in Uruguay and the seat reservation in Guyana are also a product of the first decade of the 2000s, as well as the updating of gender quotas in Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela. The advances were discrete, results of intense and long fights against the modern-colonial gender system, present in our lives until nowadays through the gender inequalities, asymmetries, and discrimination. In the second decade of the twenty-first century, about 34% of legislation was drafted, including eleven on femicide (except for Guyana and Suriname), one on total abortion in Uruguay, three updates on partial abortion in Bolivia, Brazil, and Chile, and two revisions laws on violence against women in Guyana and Peru. Colombia and Chile were the last countries to adopt gender quotas in elections, in 2011 and 2015, respectively. Three countries changed their legislation in this regard: Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru. The last law passed was of total abortion in Argentina, in 2021. In the list of the MDGs and the SDGs and already supported by the first generation of laws, these new public policies are based on a constant attempt to improve the life quality of South American women. The backlashes imposed by the pandemic and the battle in national parliaments against projects and proposals that intend to undermine the rights conquered were accentuated with the wave of elections for presidents, deputies, and nominations of ministers and conservative ministers. The situation described above had its effects on the advances of SDG 5. The last report on it shows that in 2019 Brazil, Paraguay and Peru had a critical delay in complying with SDG 5, while the other South American countries significantly delayed the pursuit of gender equality. Regarding the trend for the coming years, only Suriname and Venezuela will be stagnant, that is, maintain stability in their indicators or their progress will not be above 50% of the expected rate, thus, it is not possible to meet the SDG by 2030. All the other countries in the region fall into the moderate progress trend, in which although the level of progress is above 50% of expected, it is still not sufficient to meet the targets set out in the SDGs [115 ]. In most of South America, in 2020, significant challenges continued, however, in Ecuador, Suriname, and Uruguay, the situation improved to ‘challenges remain’. amongst the trends, only Argentina was classified as ‘on track’, on the way. A moderate increase in the indicators referring to SDG 5 [116 ] is expected from other States. The bases of the South American ‘modern’ States were designed mainly during the colonisation process, a moment in which the patriarchal/colonial pact was made. The social/sexual contract was the second step to result in the nation-State as we know it nowadays. The sexual division of labour that harms women and the unfair society to females are consequences of this long and excluder period that we are still living in. The apparent progress made by the legislation and the influence of international organisations and their agendas are hard to see in the rates and even less in women's daily lives. However, feminist movements had victories, including historical ones as the approval of total abortion in Argentina. We do not suggest that every backlash and resistance is because of the patriarchy (and capitalism and colonialism). Instead, we addressed the achievements despite the patriarchy (and capitalism and colonialism), seeking to understand the influences of international norms in the national legislations.  Conclusion The 2030 Agenda is based on three sustainability axes: environmental protection, economic development, and social inclusion. Central to these commitments is the understanding that sustainable development is also about women's empowerment and gender equality. The SDGs include gender subjects amongst its goals in a transversal and integral way, to reconcile the precepts of equality, development, and peace. Regarding the regional level, South America has high levels of inequality - a legacy from the colonisation and, especially, the patriarchal/colonial pact. At the same time, it has been the region that has advanced the most in terms of gender equality. According to the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), the current gender parity index is 69% worldwide, with emphasis on health and education areas, which reached 97% and 96%, respectively, while economic (58%) and political (25%) indexes point a long way towards the worldwide eradication of gender inequalities [117 ]. Gender inequality is higher in politics, once women were historically encouraged to stay at home, reinforcing the promotion of their roles as mothers, and not as decision-makers in the public arena. amongst South American recent political advances, we highlight the adoption of electoral gender quotas by all countries in the region - except for Guyana and Suriname. Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela had presented improvement after gender quotas adoption. In turn, Guyana is the only South American country that has adopted seat reservations for women. Based on that, we understand that the advances are yet far from what is desired and might even compromise the expected results of this type of strategy. Even so, South America has advanced regarding gender-sensitive public policies. At first, laws on domestic violence were adopted in all countries of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, such legislation is not related to the adoption of electoral gender quotas, nor the larger or minor presence of women in national parliaments. It stems from the 1994 Convention of Belém do Pará, when violence against girls and women was recognised as a serious violation of human rights. Recently, legislation on femicide was also approved in the region - except Guyana and Suriname. The greater rigour in punishing women's murders could be considered an update of domestic violence legislation initiated in the 1990s. In addition to society's and feminist movement's demands, more women in legislative seats might have had a subtle impact in this sphere, but we are aware it has no immediate effect to transform the ‘modern-colonial gender system’, nor could do this by itself. The legalisation of abortion is the most controversial issue: it faces the greatest resistance, and even backlashes. In South America, only Guyana, Uruguay, Argentina, Colombia and, recently, Chile had decriminalised the practice, while Suriname is the only one that maintains the total prohibition. Most of the South American countries authorise abortion in some specifically cases. This subject shows that having more or fewer women occupying legislative seats does not necessarily mean advancing in gender-sensitive public policies. Society and political spheres have been marked by the advance in moral and religious conservatism, and many women parliamentarians do not defend feminist agendas, on the contrary. Therefore, reinforces greater women participation in politics is a fundamental tool for promoting gender equality, even if this does not mean that elected women will necessarily adopt a favourable position to feminist agendas. Even so, the chances of women's interests being legislated by women increases, and this is a valid argument when we consider a predominantly male scenario. Female parliamentarians might propose gender-sensitive public policies: this approach is primordial to recognise women as subjects of rights with autonomy to go beyond the limits of the private sphere and increase their participation in public life. This enables women to break away from traditional gender roles, pervasive and sustained by patriarchal society. Unfortunately, this research indicates that the absence of public policies makes it difficult, if not unfeasible, for female participation in the public sphere, especially the political one. Despite the change in the gender relations structure and breaking the pattern of oppression being a slow process, it does not mean they should not be initiated and carried forward in all possible spheres simultaneously. Finally, the emphasis on women's political participation results in the political sphere being an essential one to the achievement of all the other goals of SDG 5. Through politics, legislation and public policies are formulated and implemented, which makes women's political presence so relevant to improve gender equality in our societies. This centrality stems from the fact that political arenas serve as crucibles wherein legislative frameworks and public policies, crucial instruments for societal transformation, are conceptualised and executed. Hence, the relevance of augmenting women's presence in politics cannot be overstated. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that despite antecedent efforts within South American legislative frameworks predating the formulation of these objectives, further strides are requisite to fully align with the aspirations encapsulated in SDG 5. The principal thrust of this paper is to elucidate the nuanced trajectory of progress within the region concerning the designated goals, concurrently acknowledging the persistent lacunae. By presenting a comprehensive overview of global initiatives, our aim is not only to empower civil society actors with actionable insights but also to furnish decision-makers with a holistic understanding of regional advancements. This approach facilitates the identification of areas overlooked by Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) and its associated spillover strategies. The practical and societal implications of existing policies present formidable challenges in terms of measurement, compounded by a deficit in accountability and responsibility. Despite the intrinsic relevance of a globally orientated policy framework such as SDG 5, we posit that its implementation across diverse and intricate realities is beset by considerable obstacles, rendering such initiatives more aspirational than readily tangible. While acknowledging that South American countries have made strides in achieving SDG 5 at the legislative level, the paper contends that the practical manifestations of these policies exhibit a more nuanced picture. The transformation in women's lives, attributed in part to the benevolence of key actors, is discernible at a practical level. However, at the structural level of South American States and societies, the perceptibility of these changes is less pronounced. The urgency to redress the lamentable instances of gender-based violence resulting in fatalities is unequivocal. Nevertheless, effecting substantial transformations at the structural level necessitates a temporal investment that exceeds immediate desires. In essence, this paper underscores the intricate interplay between legislative achievements, practical outcomes, and the protracted timeline inherent in effecting profound societal shifts.
