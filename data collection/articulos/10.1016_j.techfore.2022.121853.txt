                  Social media, based on information and communication technologies (ICTs), work as new channels to exchange information among stakeholders and play role in improving stakeholder engagement. Considering this aspect, we investigated the characteristics of social media posts that result in higher stakeholder engagement in the European context, and we determined which of the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) result in greater stakeholder engagement. We apply chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) method to categorize social media posts based on their engagement levels. We analyzed tweets that companies published in 2019 on Twitter that also publish sustainability reports on Global Reporting Initiative. The final sample is based on 3045 tweets from 173 firms of different industries and countries. We found that tweet characteristics such as content type (SDGs), use of hashtags, existence of link, number of characters, industry type and country of a firm significantly influence stakeholder engagement rates. The most significant SGDs are partnerships for the goals, climate action, reduced inequalities, life below water, life on land, and gender equality. This is the first study which considers the communication of SDGs by firms through social media to determine which SDGs are considered most relevant and promote higher stakeholder engagement.

Social media, based on information and communication technologies (ICTs), work as new channels to exchange information among stakeholders and play role in improving stakeholder engagement. Considering this aspect, we investigated the characteristics of social media posts that result in higher stakeholder engagement in the European context, and we determined which of the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) result in greater stakeholder engagement. We apply chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) method to categorize social media posts based on their engagement levels. We analyzed tweets that companies published in 2019 on Twitter that also publish sustainability reports on Global Reporting Initiative. The final sample is based on 3045 tweets from 173 firms of different industries and countries. We found that tweet characteristics such as content type (SDGs), use of hashtags, existence of link, number of characters, industry type and country of a firm significantly influence stakeholder engagement rates. The most significant SGDs are partnerships for the goals, climate action, reduced inequalities, life below water, life on land, and gender equality. This is the first study which considers the communication of SDGs by firms through social media to determine which SDGs are considered most relevant and promote higher stakeholder engagement.   Keywords Stakeholder engagement  SDGs  Social media  CHAID  European firms    1 Introduction The definition of stakeholders is well established in the literature as any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives (Freeman, 1984 ) or strategy (Nutt and Backoff, 1992 ). Their role has evolved together with the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR), assuming a new connotation in the business environment (Lim and Greenwood, 2017 ) known as “stakeholder engagement” (Buallay et al., 2020 ; Devin and Lane, 2014 ; Heath and Ni, 2010 ; Morsing and Schultz, 2006 ). Stakeholder engagement regards the involvement of stakeholders and is achieved by an effective communication strategy which encourages a two-way symmetric communication between organizations and stakeholders (Morsing and Schultz, 2006 ). This involvement generates mutual understanding in the relationship (Giacomarra et al., 2019 ; Lyon and Montgomery, 2013 ; Topal et al., 2020 ) and the satisfaction of a wider number of parties (Yuen et al., 2017 ). Social media could be a communication tool to succeed in building this relationship (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ). Social media enable a direct, two-way dialogue between the company and the stakeholders (Meixner et al., 2015 ; Schmeltz, 2012 ), as effectively seen through Twitter (Etter, 2013 ; Schultz et al., 2013 ). The stakeholder engagement on social media could be represented as the engagement rate on company's post (Cvijikj and Michahelles, 2013 ; Denktaş-Şakar and Sürücü, 2020 ), measured with a set of indicators such as content type. However, the effective implementation of social media found several difficulties in most strategic CSR communication plans (Zizka, 2017 ), as not all social media posts generate the same level of stakeholder engagement. The normative interventions of UN Agenda 2030 represent a great opportunity for organizations to effectively contribute to sustainable development (Taliento et al., 2019 ). The UN Agenda 2030 focuses on the definition of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that should be adopted to address the most relevant global challenges over the next years. Companies are aware of the SDGs' relevance for the future of their business, and they are starting to prioritize pursuing the goals linked with their activities (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2017 ). At the same time, the communication of their contribution to sustainability is a great opportunity to improve the stakeholders' perception of companies' value (Barchiesi and Fronzetti Colladon, 2021 ; Pillai et al., 2017 ), and increases the potentiality of stakeholder engagement (Dobele et al., 2014 ; Gomez-Carrasco and Michelon, 2017 ). Although the implementation of the SDGs in public and private enterprises has become relevant, it is still in an initial phase (Pizzi et al., 2020 ), as only few studies have attempted to investigate how companies generate value through including the SDGs into their internal processes and value chain (Mio et al., 2020 ). Previous literature has emphasized the importance of CSR and stakeholder engagement (Aguinis and Glavas, 2012 ; Crane and Glozer, 2016 ; Jeffery, 2009 ; Kesavan et al., 2013 ; Salazar, 2016 ; Wang et al., 2016 ; Belyaeva et al., 2020 ). It has focused on several industries, such as the hospitality industry (Aluri et al., 2015 ; de Grosbois, 2012 ; Holcomb et al., 2007 ; Jankovic and Krivacic, 2014 ), or on stakeholder groups, such as employees, customers or shareholders (Holcomb et al., 2007 ; Kim et al., 2015 ; Park and Levy, 2014 ) and has explored the roles of culture, innovativeness (Forcadell et al., 2021 ), technology (Walsh et al., 2020 ) and environmental performance (Kraus et al., 2020 ). Focusing on engagement model for organizations, only a few studies have examined it (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ), and there is a knowledge gap mainly at the operational, or tactical, level in terms of how to organize and present messages and dialogues in order to attain intended stakeholder engagement and how the SDGs are related to this (Zizka, 2017 ; Pizzi et al., 2020 ; Mio et al., 2020 ). Stakeholder engagement activity is crucial for the implementation of CSR strategies, the achievement of SDGs, the growth of corporate reputation and success. In order to make this activity possible and therefore maximize the contribution of stakeholders, this research aims to evaluate the role that social media can play by considering their characteristics and the different propensities to use them, as shown by the different categories of companies and their country settings (cross-country). Identifying and examining the social media posts, namely on Twitter, and the engagement rate, the research questions to address are: “What is the potential of social media to engage stakeholders and share SDG objectives? What are the characteristics that lead to higher stakeholder engagement in European companies?”. For the purposes of this study, we draw on the stakeholder theory. In this context, stakeholder engagement is deemed to help firms to find out which information and data should be part of their CSR report (Manetti, 2011 ), as well as which of the 17 SDGs are most important for firms to prioritize. Specifically, we also aim at understanding which (one or more) of the 17 SDGs lead to higher stakeholder engagement. According to our review of the literature, this is the first study that considers such a research question related to SDGs, and we try to address it by adopting the chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) method. Further, this study makes comparative analysis of eight industries among 19 European countries. The study applies CHAID method to categorize social media posts based on their engagement levels. The analysis is conducted on the tweets posted in 2019 by companies that draw up and publish a sustainability report on Global Reporting Initiative. The final sample is based on 3045 social media (Twitter) posts from 173 firms of different industries and countries. Based on CHAID analysis technique, we find that tweet characteristics, such as content type (communication of SDGs), use of hashtag, existence of link, and number of characters, as well as industry type and country of a firm, significantly influence stakeholder engagement rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which considers the communication of SDGs by the firms to determine which SDGs (among 17 UN SDGs) are more relevant and lead to higher stakeholder engagement for the business-to-consumer (B2C) firms. Our study extends previous research results by also considering industry and country specific variables in 19 European countries, with a potential impact for the firms as well as for a wide variety of stakeholders. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2  discusses the literature review, while Section 3  explains the research methodology. Data analysis and discussion are presented in Section 4 , whereas Section 5  discusses the conclusion.  2 Literature review 2.1 The theorization of the stakeholder engagement The strategic management theory can explain the motivation for companies to use social media. Using a stakeholder approach, Freeman (1984, p. 46)  defined stakeholder in an organization as “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objective”. On one side, this conceptualization underlines the role of stakeholders to guarantee the long-term success as well as the survival of organizations (Freeman and McVea, 2001 ). On the other side, it suggests organizations to take into account the expectations of those who have a stake in the business, such as shareholders, suppliers, authorities, employees, customers, and society, in the development of business strategies (Aguinis, 2011 ; Marais et al., 2020 ). A way to understand and address the stakeholders' needs and interests, taking advantages from their ability to impact outcomes of business firms, is to involve them in a relation (Veltri et al., 2020 ; Ike et al., 2019 ). This result is achievable through the stakeholder engagement practice. Several definitions of stakeholder engagement are available in the academic literature. Greenwood (2007)  defined the stakeholder engagement as the bundle of actions undertaken by companies to positively involve stakeholders in their activities. For O'Riordan and Fairbrass (2014) , the purpose of those activities is to generate dialogue opportunities between the company and its stakeholders, enabling firms to communicate, collaborate, and collect information from different stakeholders categories. A recent study explored how the need for gaining, maintaining, or repairing legitimacy shapes the mechanisms to engage stakeholders in companies' governance (Leardini et al., 2019 ). This study reported that formal mechanisms in which local stakeholders directly appoint board members play a significant role in repairing legitimacy. On the other hand, actual participation of stakeholders is required in gaining legitimacy, whereas formal mechanisms that balance the leadership representativeness and competencies are needed for maintaining legitimacy. The objective of engaging stakeholders is to develop loyal and long-term relationships with them, so that they can provide more resources to the companies (Kujala et al., 2022 ). Organizations need to establish an engagement level to reach, which will be achieved selecting stakeholders in relation to their impact on the sustainable performance of the company. According to Surucu-Balci et al. (2020, p. 2) , the stakeholder engagement process includes four categories: mapping stakeholders (i), aimed at identifying and segmenting firms' stakeholders. In this phase, stakeholders are categorized and selected based on their priority, which depends on their impact. Examining engagement models (ii), referred to the appropriateness of the engagement model elaborated to reach the engagement level previously set. Addressing stakeholders' concerns (iii), focused on determining the problems that each category of stakeholders experiences in order to assess the risk and opportunities that emerge from their problems. Planning actions (iv), regarding both the formulation of strategies to solve the problems that stakeholders experience, and the evaluation system, that collects and compares feedbacks with the strategies' objectives, to measure the effectiveness of the strategies in meeting stakeholders' needs. In the literature, only a few studies have focused on engagement models for the firms: in particular, we refer to the study by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) . Thus, there is a knowledge gap mainly at the operational, or tactical, level in terms of how to organize and present messages and dialogues in order to attain intended stakeholders' engagement and how the SDGs are related to this. In the digitalized world, for the engagement model, social media, based on information and communication technologies (ICTs), communicate information for the active and passive audience and work as engagement channels to improve stakeholders' engagement by complementing traditional channels (Mention et al., 2019 ), including sustainability reports, focus groups, meetings, interviews, television and newspaper articles.  2.2 Exploring the characteristics of stakeholder engagement The implementation of effective strategies able to engage stakeholders requires researchers to deeply analyze the role and characteristics of social media in enhancing relationship between organizations and stakeholders (Gamboa and Gonçalves, 2014 ). Several studies have demonstrated that social media, due to their ability to activate a two-way symmetrical communication can increase the level of engagement (Viglia et al., 2018 ), as well as challenge the way stakeholders are engaged (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ). Based on Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , we agreed on the set of determinants identified as relevant in influencing the stakeholder engagement rate (SER), such as: type of media, content type, timing, and length of message, as they greatly affect the number of likes, comments and re-shares of the posts. In the literature, few studies have focused on finding out the determinants in social media for higher stakeholder engagement. By analyzing the literature, we make propositions for social media posts according to which factors influence the stakeholders' engagement rate. 2.2.1 The role of post's fluency The first determinant analyzed in the engagement model proposed by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  is the post's fluency. This concept considers people cognitively busy, such as social media users, and “the subjective experience of ease with which people process information” (Alter and Oppenheimer, 2009 , p. 219). Specifically, referring to the social media context, users like posts that are fluent, in which information processing is easy (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ; McShane et al., 2019 ). Length of message and inclusion of hashtags in the social media post influence the fluency of the post. The aim of including a hashtag in the post is to improve stakeholder engagement. In previous studies, as described in Surucu-Balci et al. (2020, p. 4) , Pancer and Poole (2016)  argued that the inclusion of a hashtag may lead to increased effort to translate the symbols, due to lack of visual clarity. Those results were also supported by McShane et al.'s (2019) , whose analysis of Twitter posts found that hashtag use results in lower engagement (less likes and shares) of the posts. Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  also found that posts that are shorter and have no hashtag leads to higher engagement rates. Therefore, based on Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , we have developed the first proposition for the investigated industries on Twitter.Proposition 1 Across industries, the post's fluency significantly influences the SER.    2.2.2 The influence of post's content (communication of SDGs) The second determinant selected from the engagement model proposed by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  is the post's content. Firms share posts of a variety of content, including announcements and promotions of new services, special day celebrations, industry information, CSR, as well as communications about adopting and implementing UN SDGs (Osei-Frimpong and McLean, 2018 ). However, our point of interest is only the communication of SDGs in the social media posts. The posts based on different content can affect the engagement rate of users. It is argued that posts containing SDGs messages shared by chief executive officers (CEOs) result in greater social participation and SDGs engagement (Vaast et al., 2017 ). Arguably, it is essential to analyze stakeholders' perceptions and evaluate CSR reporting to explain their potential effects on CSR reputation (Hetze, 2016 ). In this context, Grover et al. (2019)  examined the impact of CSR messages focusing on SDGs on corporate reputation shared on Twitter based on the assumption that the CEOs are socially responsible to discuss all the concerns and issues raised by SDGs on social media. Thus, such discussion on social media enhances awareness about SDGs among followers and provides the opportunity for firm CEOs to adopt the relevant practices (Grover et al., 2019 ). The scholars adopting the framework of SDGs 2030 Agenda for the top shipping companies analyzed the strategic fit of the sustainability communications on Twitter both internally (core business) and externally (public) (Wang et al., 2021 ). They found that shipping firms demonstrate a diversification trend concerning sustainability communications. This diversification gradually extends from SDGs focus on the industry's core responsibilities to secondary responsibilities. On the contrary, the public's response demonstrates a convergence trend. This trend depicts that the public's interest has been increasingly diverting from SDGs related to the industry's secondary responsibilities to core ones (Wang et al., 2021 ). Moreover, it has become critical for most firms to determine what CSR activities need to undertake and how to communicate CSR-related messages to consumers due to increasing consumer skepticism (Moreno and Kang, 2020 ). Therefore, this study examined the role of content and delivery in CSR communications to alleviate consumer skepticism concerning CSR. The findings revealed that the skepticism significantly alleviates when there is a fit between the firm's core values and the CSR activities it communicates. Further, the results depicted that the delivery of CSR messages can be of more importance than the content itself in influencing skepticism. Hence, it is recommended that while communicating CSR messages, it is necessary for the practitioners to carefully consider the fit, tone, and authenticity of the message to reduce skepticism (Moreno and Kang, 2020 ). In a previous study, the authors examined Facebook posts and found that stakeholder engagement is significantly influenced by the content of social media posts (Denktaş-Şakar and Sürücü, 2020 ). In particular, the authors found that the level of engagement may change depending on whether the post contains information or entertainment (Khan et al., 2016 ). Therefore, based on Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , we propose the following proposition for the investigated industries on Twitter.Proposition 2 Across industries, the post's content type (communication of SDGs) significantly influences the SER.    2.2.3 The influence of post's vividness The third determinant investigated by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  in their engagement model is the post's vividness. The focus is on the media files (images, gifs, or videos) added to a post, which distinguish low, medium or high vividness level of a post (De Vries et al., 2012 ). As suggested by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020, p. 4) , low vividness is when the posts contain only sentences or links (text). Medium vividness is when the post contains a photo, while high vividness results when a video or a gif is included in the post. In the literature, there is conflicting evidence on the relation between media type, or vividness level, and the engagement rate. Authors found that engagement level is high when vividness is high (De Vries et al., 2012 ), that is when the tweets contain image or video (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ; McShane et al., 2019 ) or Facebook posts include images and videos (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ; Viglia et al., 2018 ). In a recent analysis, authors found two different results: in the first, Facebook posts that contain images result in higher engagement than the posts with text and video (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ; Denktaş-Şakar and Sürücü, 2020 ). Conversely, in the second, authors found that posts with videos or gifs lead to higher engagement rate than posts with images and texts (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ). We conclude that, despite the conflicting evidence, type of media or vividness influences the level of engagement. Thus, based on Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , we have developed the third proposition for the investigated industries on Twitter.Proposition 3 Across industries, the post's vividness level significantly influences the SER.    2.2.4 The role of a link in posts The fourth determinant drawn from the engagement model proposed by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  is the presence of a link in a post. The same authors highlight that in social media platforms, a user can add an external link to a webpage or other posts, where followers could get more detailed information about the posted topic. In the literature, researchers have conducted studies to examine how inclusion of a link in a post influences engagement rate. Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , by examining Twitter posts, saw that posts with external links have higher engagement rates, while Pancer and Poole (2016)  argued that including an external link in tweets leads to lower engagement levels. By considering these, we conclude that a relationship exists between external link inclusion and engagement level, despite the conflicting findings. Thus, based on Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , we have developed a fourth proposition for the investigated industries on Twitter.Proposition 4 Across industries, the existence of a link in posts significantly influences the SER.     2.3 Industry type of a firm Social media is used by range of companies from different industries. As earlier discussed, this platform is the least expensive platform for advertising and promoting a new service or for communicating any news which the company understands should be shared to users. In the literature, several studies have focused on firms of one particular industry to determine the stakeholder engagement level for social media posts. For instance, in the study by Denktaş-Şakar and Sürücü (2020) , the sample firms were from the top-30 third-party logistics firms. In another study, the authors used the sample of fashion retailers (Escobar-Rodríguez and Bonsón-Fernández, 2017 ). Khan et al. (2016)  used a sample of five different brands. In a study by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , the sample included container lines from business-to-business (B2B) companies. However, they argued that findings may change if the industry type changes. Manetti and Bellucci (2016)  also recommended assessing stakeholder engagement by investigating social media use of different sectors/types of organizations. Therefore, by considering these argument and recommendation, we have developed the fifth proposition.Proposition 5 SER is significantly influenced by the tweets from different industry types.    2.4 Country of a firm Firms use social media, which is a globalized digital platform that connects the world. However, we understand that, despite the use of social media by firms, the firm origin is important, as culture is country-based and, in each country's setting, users have different characteristics, which may affect stakeholder engagement differently. Kumar et al. (2019)  argued that there are differences in institutional frameworks at the national level, and therefore, the interpretation and operationalization of stakeholder management practices is different even with the global nature of CSR. The same concept applies to the SDGs, due to their global nature. Agudo-Valiente et al. (2015)  argued that country characteristics influence the perception of CSR activities. As argued by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , results may change if one considers different industry types. By considering these arguments, we propose that tweets of firms from different countries may lead to different levels of stakeholder engagement. In this study, the sample firms are from 19 European countries. Therefore, we have developed our sixth proposition.Proposition 6 SER is significantly influenced by the tweets from firms of different countries.     3 Research methodology We use chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) analysis for the data analysis. This technique employs several independent variables and only one dependent variable for the posts' classification. Here follows the explanations of the sampling procedure, data collection, variables used, as well as the CHAID analysis. 3.1 Sampling procedure and the data As highlighted in Surucu-Balci et al. (2020, p. 5) , Twitter has 330 million monthly users of its micro-blogging site, that generates each day around 0.5 billion tweets are posted, which equals 6000 tweets every second. Twitter features dual conversations among users and allows firms to get in touch and engage with a variety of stakeholders, and to run marketing and advertising campaigns. In this study, we focused on firms in European countries. We selected the sample for this study by considering those European companies that wrote and published a sustainability report on the Global Reporting Initiative platform for the year 2019. After examining the sustainability reports, we found that there are a total of 302 European firms from 21 European countries. Specifically, we targeted those companies that shared tweets quoting any of the 17 UN SDGs (see Table 1  ), meaning that each tweet contains at least one SDG, although a tweet may contain two or more, or even all SDGs. In earlier literature, most studies focused on collecting tweets manually (see Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ). However, studies also use advanced techniques to collect tweets (see Grover et al., 2019 ). Collecting tweets through a manual method is a time-consuming task, and, in this case, advanced techniques are more advantageous. However, we opted for hand-collection of tweets as we are using a content type variable (communication of SDGs). The reason is that we need to go through each tweet individually to identify which of the SGD/s is/are being communicated. Further, not every tweet contains SDG/s; therefore, we collected tweets manually for the time period between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. We completed the data collection procedure in June 2020. However, some of the firms that published a sustainability report on the Global Reporting Initiative platform were excluded from the sample due to the absence of a Twitter account or, in the case of an existing Twitter account, they had not posted any communication about the 17 SDGs. Therefore, our sample is restricted to 173 firms in 19 European countries (see Table 2  ) and from eight different industries (see Table 3  ), with the total of 3045 tweets focusing on at least one of the 17 SDGs. We provide the following sample tweet, which was tweeted by Barclays Bank on October 21, 2019, for the readers to better understand the communication of SDG/s in tweets.“Our #UnreasonableImpact Americas accelerator, in partnership with @Unreasonable, is currently taking place – bringing together 15 companies that are addressing the environmental challenges of today and creating the jobs of tomorrow. Meet the entrepreneurs: https://barc.ly/2W1zQQf ”    3.2 The coding process of data Data coding was done according to the coding protocol of Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , that adopted the model already used in De Vries et al. (2012)  and Luarn et al. (2015) . Two authors performed the coding procedure with regard to the communication of SDGs variable, as it is more like a content type variable, due to its complexity. Conversely, all the other variables were coded by a single author. The reason is that we gathered only posts that communicated any of the 17 SDGs. Both authors separately coded sample firms' tweets that were posted between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019 for the aforementioned variable. The authors compared their results after completing the coding, and in case of any dispute about the posts that are coded or when one of the authors considered no reference was made about an SDGs (blank cell), the authors re-examined the disputed posts in order to come to consensus. The next step of the coding protocol (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ) requested the calculation of the inter-coder reliability based on Perreault and Leigh's (1989)  method, posing the reliability of the coding test between 0.8 and 1.0. Our coding result was 0.98, which fulfills the criteria of coding reliability. In this research, as we already anticipated, we conducted the analysis based on one dependent variable and seven independent variables. We used tweet characteristics/parameters, which also have been considered and discussed in earlier studies (see Bonsón and Ratkai, 2013 ; Bonsón et al., 2016 ; Chae, 2015 ; Denktaş-Şakar and Sürücü, 2020 ; Dodson, 2016 ; Khan et al., 2016 ; McShane et al., 2019 ; Stieglitz et al., 2014 ; Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ; Viglia et al., 2018 ). 3.2.1 Independent variables Communication of SDGs is like a content type variable, and it consists of 17 categories (see Table 1 ). Tweets were coded based on each SDG category. For instance, if a tweet contained information regarding the first category of SDGs, which is “No Poverty”, then it was coded as 1, and so on. There were many tweets that contained at least two SDGs, in which case we coded them based on how many SDGs they had. Sometimes a tweet contained all the SDGs. Therefore, by considering this, the communication of SDGs variable is basically 17 variables. As we discussed earlier, we adopted an approach similar to Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  by considering this variable to be more like a content type. Therefore, similarly to the study of Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , fluency of messages was measured by using two variables, which are length of message, and hashtag usage. We considered the number of characters of a tweet to measure length of message variable, as each tweet can have a maximum of 280 characters. Like in Surucu-Balci et al. (2020, p. 5) , the length of message was the only continuous or metric independent variable. For hashtag usage, which is a categorical variable, we considered if the post contained or was without a hashtag and coded it as “yes” or “no” (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 , p. 5). According to Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , vividness level is based on three categories: low, medium and high. Vividness is low when a tweet has only text (for instance, a sentence or a link). If the tweet contains image(s), then vividness is medium, while vividness is high if the tweet contains a video or a gif. Existence of a link means that a tweet contains an external link, and it was coded “yes” if it had one and “no” if it did not (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 , p. 5). Country of a firm variable is based on 19 categories, as the firms in our sample were in 19 different European countries. We included country variable to make a comparative analysis among sample countries (Kumar et al., 2019 ). Industry of a firm contains eight categories, as the tweets were from the firms of eight different industries. We included industry variable in our analysis to find out which industry posts lead to higher stakeholder engagement, as suggested by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) .  3.2.2 Dependent variable Drawing on the study of Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , we considered the stakeholder engagement rate as the dependent variable in our analysis using the CHAID decision tree. Similarly to Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , we calculated the stakeholder engagement rate by adopting the formula developed by Bonsón and Ratkai (2013)  and Bonsón et al. (2016) , as this formula can be used for both Twitter and Facebook posts. The engagement rate was computed from the number of interactions, which are like or favorite, comment and re-tweet. Therefore, we gathered the sample posts along with their number of interactions and then made calculations as per the formula (see Table 4  ). This formula is based on popularity (likes), commitment (comments) and virality (re-tweets). To compute each post, we had to make two separate calculations. For popularity, we computed the average number of likes per tweet (P2) and average number of likes per 1000 followers (P3). For commitment, we computed the average number of comments per tweet (C2) and the average number of comments per 1000 followers (C3). For virality, we computed the average number of re-tweets per tweet (V2) and the average number of re-tweets per 1000 followers (V3). The calculation of P2 was made by dividing total likes with total tweets, and similar calculations for C2 (comments) and V2 (re-tweets) were performed. To calculate P3, P2 was divided by the total followers, and the obtained value was multiplied by 1000. The similar computation for C3 (comments) and V3 (re-tweets) was performed. The process of dividing average number of likes (P2), comments (C2) and re-tweets (V2) with total followers help to mitigate the possibility that the difference in total followers of the firms may influence the engagement level of tweets. At last, P3, C3 and V3 were summed up in order to get the stakeholder engagement rate.   3.3 The CHAID decision tree method We share the same methodology approach of the study of Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) . Therefore, we use CHAID, a decision tree technique for classifying data and making predictions. This method involves statistical analysis, while it presents easy to interpret visual results. Like in Surucu-Balci et al. (2020, p. 6) , through CHAID, the whole data set is split into homogenous and exhaustive subgroups based on the interaction between the response variable and predictor variables, and then it builds non-binary trees (Kass, 1980 ). Additionally, as highlighted by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020, p. 6) , Díaz-Pérez and Bethencourt-Cejas (2016)  discussed that, in CHAID analysis, there is no requirement to fulfill the assumption of normal distribution, as it is a non-parametric technique. Moreover, the CHAID technique can have only one criterion (response) variable and several predicting (explanatory) variables, while independent and dependent variables can be either nominal or metric (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 , p. 6; Waara et al., 2015 ). There are several steps performed by CHAID, and, in every step, the CHAID algorithm compares the independent variables to determine the most significant predictor to partition the dataset (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 , p. 6). At the first stage, the whole dataset is partitioned according to the most significant predictor and, after that, further splits are made to the partitioned data according to the successive most significant independent variable, which results in creating nodes; the process of forming nodes continues until no significant relationship (heterogeneous node) exists between the predictor and criterion variable (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 , p. 6; Díaz-Pérez and Bethencourt-Cejas, 2016 ). The CHAID algorithm uses chi-square statistics for the nominal dependent variable, while for the continuous or metric dependent variable, it uses F-tests to partition the dataset (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 , p. 6; Ozgulbas and Serhan Koyuncugil, 2006 ). Node splitting criteria is conventionally set at the 0.05 level of significance, while there are three categories of nodes in the CHAID analysis, which are root, parent and child nodes: the first node which appears on top is the root node and it is based on the whole sample; the partitioned nodes, if they are further split into subgroups, are called parent node; the group is a child node if no more split occurs (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 , p. 6). Although our sample is large, due to inclusion of the industry variable as an independent variable, we have adjusted the smaller parent/child node ratio as 60/30 to make the tree growth more aggressive (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 , p. 6; McCormick et al., 2017 ). This means that, in our analysis, 60 is the lowest possible number for a parent node, and similarly, 30 is the lowest possible number for a child node. The tree is adjusted to 5 to let the tree more aggressively represent that, when the tree splits into five layers, further splitting stops. CHAID analysis was conducted by using version 20 of SPSS. As Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  observed, the technique of CHAID decision tree is famous in other disciplines, such as travel (Xiong and Zhang, 2014 ), public transportation (Waara et al., 2015 ) and tourism (Díaz-Pérez and Bethencourt-Cejas, 2016 ), where studies were conducted with the purpose of segmenting, predicting and classifying. However, in the literature for social media studies, only the study by Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  has employed the CHAID technique in order to examine which type of post group leads to higher engagement.   4 Data analysis and discussion The results of descriptive statistics are presented in Table 5  . The results show that around 75 % of the posts shared comprise at least one hashtag. Regarding the existence of a link in the tweet, almost 54 % of the posts shared have an external link enabling stakeholders to get further information by clicking and visiting that link. The results in Table 6   illustrate that 70.8 % of the posts contain photos, representing medium vividness, while high vividness is represented by only 16.4 % of the posts that contain video and gifs. The posts that have low vividness and that have only sentences and/or links are 12.8 %. The results shown in Table 7   illustrate that the energy and resource extraction sector has more tweets (37 %), indicating that this sector is focusing more on communicating SDGs than other sectors, followed by the transportation (20.4 %) and resource transformation (15.2 %) sectors, respectively. Regarding country-wise descriptive statistics, as shown in Table 8  , German firms focus more on communication of SDGs, as they contribute around 22.4 % of our sample countries, followed by the France (16.2 %), United Kingdom (13.2 %), Spain (8.7 %), Italy (8.3 %) and Sweden (8 %), respectively. The descriptive statistics of SDGs, as shown in Table 9  , indicate that, in our sample, firms have posted 6363 tweets about SDGs. However, the total number of tweets in our sample is 3045. The reason for the disparity is that, as earlier discussed in Section 3  “Methodology”, each tweet contains at least one SDG, but some tweets may contain two or more, or even all, SDGs. Therefore, by performing content analysis on the tweets, we have found that firms have communicated SDGs 6363 times in the sample of 3045 tweets. Further, Table 9  illustrates that SDG 9, which is industry, innovation and infrastructure, is the most communicated SDG (19 %) of our sample firms and countries. The second most communicated SDG is responsible consumption and production (18.7 %), followed by the climate action (16.8 %). Affordable and clean energy is the fourth most communicated SDG (11.1 %) in our sample. The mean value of the number of characters for all tweets is 223 characters. We further perform one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for industry of a firm variable as shown in Table 10  . The results indicate that there are significant differences for the tweets between all the industry groups with respect to stakeholder engagement rate; fluency of the messages including both length of the messages and hashtag usage; existence of a link; vividness level; and content type. in case of stakeholder engagement rate, tweets shared by firms of apparel & textiles, consumption; resource transformation; and technology & communications industries have highest mean values, representing higher stakeholder engagement rates for these industries, respectively. Further, in case of length of messages, tweets from the firms of infrastructure; apparel & textiles, consumption; technology & communications; and resource transformation industries have highest mean values, indicating longer messages for these industries, respectively. Moreover, in case of hashtag usage, tweets from the firms of financials; and energy & resource extraction industries contain more hashtags. Further, in case of existence of a link, tweets from the firms of apparel & textiles, consumption; and energy & resource extraction industries contain more links. In case of vividness level, tweets from the firms of health care, hospitality & recreation; and technology & communications industries have high vividness less as the tweets contain text, photos as well as videos. Lastly, in case of content type (communication of SDGs), firms from energy & resource extraction; financials; apparel & textiles, consumption; technology & communications; and infrastructure industries have communicated most the SGD of industry, innovation and infrastructure in their tweets. On the other hand, tweets from the firms of resource transformation; and transportation industries have quoted most the SGD of decent work and economic growth. While tweets from health care, hospitality & recreation industry have quoted most the SDG of affordable and clean energy. 4.1 CHAID decision tree results As per the same methodological approach shared with the study of Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , our CHAID analysis provided the results that are shown in Figs. 1 to 4     . The decision tree that we obtained significantly formed 30 nodes, which are classified as 1 root, 12 parent nodes and 17 child nodes. Node 1, among the parent nodes, is the largest one with 1981 posts, whereas Node 25 is the smallest one with 120 posts. Among the child nodes, Node 21 is largest one with 771 posts, whereas Node 18 is the smallest one with 33 posts. We further provide the CHAID decision tree results in a table format, as shown in Table 11  . The reason is to provide a better understanding of the results. In Table 11 , we present all the components of the CHAID decision tree. Our results show that the average value of stakeholder engagement rate is 0.16 for the overall sample of 3045 tweets. We also observe that the independent variables, including SDGs, country, existence of a link, industry, use of hashtag, and number of characters, significantly partition the dataset. Moreover, while in the study of Surucu-Balci et al. (2020, p. 7)  the number of characters emerges as the first predictor, our CHAID results show that tweets about SDGs is the first significant predictor of the engagement level. As displayed in Fig. 1 , tweets about SDGs of partnerships for the goals; climate action; reduced inequalities; life below water; life on land; and gender equality (Node 2, with the mean value of 0.36) lead to greater stakeholder engagement in comparison to those about other SDGs, which are responsible consumption and production; affordable and clean energy; peace, justice and strong institutions; and clean water and sanitation (Node 1, mean = 0.14), and SDGs of sustainable cities and communities; industry, innovation and infrastructure; zero hunger; decent work and economic growth; quality education; and good health and well-being (Node 3, mean = 0.063). The posts in Nodes 1, 2 and 3 are separated into country, existence of a link and country, respectively. In Node 2, the posts are split into two by the existence of a link. The posts that have no link (Node 9), with the mean value of 0.59, result in greater stakeholder engagement compared with the posts that have a link (Node 8) (mean = 0.22). The posts with SDGs of responsible consumption and production; affordable and clean energy; peace, justice and strong institutions; and clean water and sanitation (Node 1) are split into four by country. Posts from firms in Luxembourg, Greece, Czech Republic and Hungary (Node 5) lead to higher engagement with stakeholders (mean = 0.58), followed by firms from Sweden, Denmark and Ireland (Node 7 with a mean value of 0.22), firms from Spain, Finland, Austria, Portugal and Belgium (Node 6 with a mean value of 0.16), and firms from Italy, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Netherlands (Node 4 with a mean value of 0.10), for communicating these SDGs. Fig. 2  illustrates that communication of SDGs significantly partitions Node 4. The SDGs of responsible consumption and production; decent work and economic growth; reduced inequalities; and peace, justice and strong institutions (Node 13) result in higher stakeholder engagement (average = 0.19) than the SDGs of sustainable cities and communities; affordable and clean energy; life on land; industry, innovation and infrastructure; quality education; gender equality; climate action; partnerships for the goals; good health and well-being; no poverty; clean water and sanitation; life below water; and zero hunger (Node 12 with a mean value of 0.09). The inclusion of a link in the post significantly splits Node 13. The posts that have no link (Node 23) lead to higher engagement level with a mean value of 0.30, and posts with a link (Node 22) have an average value of 0.11. Further, the use of hashtags significantly splits the Node 12 into two subgroups: Yes and No. The posts with a hashtag (Node 21) have a mean value of 0.10, whereas the posts with no hashtag (Node 20) have a mean value of 0.06. The country variable significantly partitions Node 20, as shown in Fig. 3 . Posts from firms in Italy, Germany, France and Netherlands (Node 26) have a mean value of 0.09, while posts from firms in the United Kingdom (Node 27) have a mean value of 0.02. The industry variable, as illustrated in Fig. 2 , significantly splits Node 6. Posts from the industries including apparel & textiles consumption; financials; and transportation (Node 15) have significantly higher engagement levels (mean = 0.41), while posts from energy & resource extraction; health care, hospitality & recreation; infrastructure; resource transformation; and technology & communications industries (Node 14) have a mean value of 0.12. Further, the use of hashtags significantly partitions Node 7. The posts with no hashtag (Node 16) have an engagement mean of 0.38, whereas posts with a hashtag (Node 17) have a mean value of 0.12. On the contrary, the tweets which communicate SDGs of sustainable cities and communities; industry, innovation and infrastructure; zero hunger; decent work and economic growth; quality education; and good health and well-being (Node 3) are split into two by country, as shown in Fig. 4 . Tweets from firms in United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Finland, Greece, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Netherlands (Node 11) have significantly higher engagement levels (mean = 0.09), whereas posts from the firms in Italy, France and Ireland (Node 10) have a mean value of (0.02). The communication of SDGs significantly splits Node 10. The communication of SDGs in posts including sustainable cities and communities; decent work and economic growth; and good health and well-being (Node 18) lead to higher stakeholder engagement (mean = 0.04) in comparison to those posts that communicate SDGs of industry, innovation and infrastructure; zero hunger; and quality education (Node 19), with a mean value of 0.01. Node 19 is split into two by the industry variable. Posts from firms in energy & resource extraction; apparel & textiles, consumption; health care, hospitality & recreation; infrastructure; resource transformation; and technology & communications industries (Node 24) have higher engagement levels (mean = 0.03), while posts from transportation firms (Node 25) have a mean value of 0.006. The number of characters significantly splits Node 25. Posts with 174 or fewer characters (Node 28) result in higher stakeholder engagement (mean = 0.01) than the posts that have >174 characters (Node 29), with a mean value of 0.004. The results represent that, as shown in Table 12  , Node 9, among all the subgroups, engages the most, where the posts communicate SDGs of partnerships for the goals; climate action; reduced inequalities; life below water; life on land; and gender equality, and have no external link. Node 5 is the second most engaging subgroup of posts that communicate SDGs of responsible consumption and production; affordable and clean energy; peace, justice and strong institutions; and clean water and sanitation, and they are shared by firms in Luxembourg, Greece, Czech Republic and Hungary. Further, the third most engaging subgroup is Node 15, which bears a resemblance to the Node 5 with respect to communication of SDGs. However, the difference occurs in post sharing, as posts in this subgroup are shared in Spain, Finland, Austria, Portugal and Belgium. Further, it also consists of posts that are shared by the firms of apparel & textiles, consumption; financials; and transportation industries. The fourth subgroup that leads to more engagement is Node 16, which also resembles the Node 5 in terms of communication of SDGs. However, the difference arises for the posts by country, as the posts in this subgroup are shared by firms in Sweden, Denmark and Ireland. Moreover, the posts use no hashtag in this subgroup. On the other hand, Node 29 is the least engaging subgroup, which contains posts that communicate SDGs of sustainable cities and communities; industry, innovation and infrastructure; zero hunger; decent work and economic growth; quality education; and good health and well-being, and are shared by firms in Italy, France and Ireland, specifically communicating SDGs of industry, innovation and infrastructure; zero hunger; and quality education. They are shared by the firms of transportation industry, and have >174 characters. The second least engaging subgroup is Node 28, which resembles Node 29, although, it differs in terms of the number of characters, as in this subgroup, posts have 174 or fewer characters.  4.2 Discussion Based on the findings, this study provides evidence that by using social media, the favorable outcome of stakeholder engagement for firms is influenced by different characteristics of the posts that are shared. We find that all the predictor (independent) variables that we used in our analysis significantly split the entire sample with respect to the stakeholder engagement rate, except the vividness level. Based on the results of our analysis, all the propositions that we developed in the literature review are approved, except Proposition 3 , which is related to vividness level. According to our analysis, we find no evidence of significance for the relationship between vividness level and stakeholder engagement rate. The fluency of message (length of message, and hashtag usage) has a significant impact on the stakeholder engagement rate supporting our Proposition 1 . Specifically, we find that shorter tweets and tweets with no hashtag lead to higher engagement. These results are in line with the recommendation of Dodson (2016) , who suggested the message or tweet should be shorter in order to have higher stakeholder engagement. Further, these results support the findings of McShane et al. (2019) , Pancer and Poole (2016)  and Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  that higher engagement rate is achieved by communicating more fluent messages. Tweets with no hashtag lead to a higher engagement rate, and these tweets are shared by firms of Sweden, Denmark and Ireland, which supports that inclusion of hashtags makes text difficult and thus, results in lower engagement level (McShane et al., 2019 ; Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, we also find that tweets that contain hashtags (Node 21) have higher engagement rates than posts with no hashtags that are shared by firms in Italy, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Netherlands. However, we also note that this difference is minor. Actually, the aim of including hashtags is to attract audience and users' attention at wider levels so that users may search tweets with specific hashtags. This increases the visibility of social media posts, but the increase in engagement rate is not guaranteed (Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ). The content type of posts based on communication of SGDs significantly affects the stakeholder engagement rate supporting our Proposition 2 . Particularly, the SDGs of partnerships for the goals; climate action; reduced inequalities; life below water; life on land; and gender equality result in higher stakeholder engagement rates than any other SDGs. This group of SDGs that relates to environmental and social issues engage stakeholders the most. The second most significant group of SDGs that lead to higher engagement rates that is based on the SDGs of responsible consumption and production; affordable and clean energy; peace, justice and strong institutions; and clean water and sanitation. The third group of SDGs that leads to the lower engagement rates includes SDGs of sustainable cities and communities; industry, innovation and infrastructure; zero hunger; decent work and economic growth; quality education; and good health and well-being. These results are in line with the findings of Denktaş-Şakar and Sürücü (2020)  and Khan et al. (2016) , reporting that content type of social media posts significantly impact stakeholder engagement. These results further support the argument that SDGs messages on social media lead to higher social participation and SDGs engagement (Vaast et al., 2017 ). Further, these findings support the argument that it is the CEOs' responsibility to discuss all the concerns and issues raised by SDGs on social media as such discussion results in improved awareness about SDGs among followers (Grover et al., 2019 ). Moreover, our results support the argument that practitioners must consider the CSR messages' fit, tone, and genuineness while communicating them to decrease consumer skepticism (Moreno and Kang, 2020 ). The existence of a link has a significant influence on the stakeholder engagement rate supporting our Proposition 4 . Indeed, the posts without the link result in greater levels of stakeholder engagement. These results support the findings of Pancer and Poole (2016)  that inclusion of links in tweets lead to lower engagement levels. Our CHAID analysis provides evidence that the industry type and country of a firm also significantly influence stakeholder engagement rates supporting our Propositions 5 and 6 , respectively. Among the 19 European countries, Luxembourg, Greece, Czech Republic and Hungary successfully engage stakeholders for the SDGs of responsible consumption and production; affordable and clean energy; peace, justice and strong institutions; and clean water and sanitation. Further, based on this group of SDGs, firms from apparel & textiles, consumption; financials; and transportation industries belonging to Spain, Finland, Austria, Portugal, and Belgium engage stakeholders more. Therefore, concerning the industry type of a firm, these results support the argument of Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  that industry types may have different stakeholder engagement as the sample firms in our study are from eight various industries. Further, for the country of a firm, our findings support the argument that country characteristics influence the perception of CSR activities (Kumar et al., 2019 ). In our analysis, we find that vividness level has no significant influence on the stakeholder engagement rate not supporting our Proposition 3 . The reason is that, as we discuss in Section 2 , the literature review, that there is conflicting evidence on the relationship between media type, or vividness level, and the engagement rate, as studies have found different results in their relationship (McShane et al., 2019 ; Denktaş-Şakar and Sürücü, 2020 ; Surucu-Balci et al., 2020 ).   5 Conclusion This study considered social media, namely Twitter, to determine which characteristics of social media messages that firms post could result in higher stakeholder engagement in the European context. Specifically, we determined which (or which group) of the 17 SDGs lead to higher stakeholder engagement among different industries across 19 European countries. By gathering a total of 3045 tweets from 173 firms that communicated any of the 17 SDGs in their message, we used CHAID analysis to analyze the data. Based on the CHAID analysis, we found that tweets' characteristics, such as content type (communication of SDGs), use of hashtag, existence of link, and number of characters, as well as industry type and country of a firm, significantly influence stakeholder engagement rates. This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, following the pioneer study of Surucu-Balci et al. (2020) , we used a social media channel to assess firms' stakeholder engagement, thus further contributing to the effectiveness and the efficiency of stakeholder engagement debate. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which considers the firms' communication of SDGs to determine which SDGs are considered most important and lead to higher stakeholder engagement. Third, our study extends the analysis of Surucu-Balci et al. (2020)  and addresses its call to consider different industries and countries. In fact, in this study, we focus on eight different industries, which are energy & resource extraction; apparel & textiles, consumption; financials; transportation; health care, hospitality & recreation; infrastructure; resource transformation; and technology & communications. We also targeted our sample firms from 19 European countries. This broader analysis could have substantial impact for the firms as well as for a wide variety of stakeholders. Lastly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which employs decision tree methodology for the business-to-consumer (B2C) firms to classify social media posts in order to identify which group of posts results in a higher engagement rate. This study offers several practical implications for practitioners and firm stakeholders. First, concerning SDGs, out of 17 SDGs, six are the most engaging ones, including the partnerships for the goals; climate action; reduced inequalities; life below water; life on land; and gender equality. Generally, these SDGs are more related to environmental and social concerns (de Haan et al., 2014 ) and this is in line with the pressure the world is facing to use resources more sustainably. This evidence suggests that stakeholders are more concerned about these issues, and firms need to pay more attention to such concerns for sustainable development and meet stakeholders' expectations. If a firm adopts any of these six SDGs based on their operations and the practitioners communicate them on social media, it will probably successfully engage stakeholders. SDGs' objective is to achieve a sustainable world based on the UN 2030 Agenda considering economic, environmental, and social issues. However, it is very unlikely that a single firm could focus on all the SDGs at the same time. In this case, all the industrial actors need to focus on the SDGs based on their business activity and operations. Specifically, we provide the most critical SDGs that firms across industries and countries should focus on to engage stakeholders and ultimately contribute to sustainable development. Next, for tweets characteristics, we recommend practitioners communicate more fluent messages by keeping them short and without hashtags in tweets or social media posts, resulting in higher engagement. We further suggest practitioners avoid including external links in the tweets, as stakeholders will engage more if posts do not contain an external link. Moreover, practitioners also need to consider that industry, and country characteristics play a vital role in engaging stakeholders. As in some countries, stakeholders are concerned about specific issues, while in other countries, the focus of stakeholders is on other issues. However, the agenda of SDGs is not limited only to specific countries but the whole world. Therefore, each SDG is important, and practitioners need to focus on those issues which are more relevant in their respective countries and industry. It will help resolve the relevant economic, environmental, and social issues and successfully engage stakeholders. As this study presents a broader analysis, these results can be generalized to all European countries as well as to other continents. However, we have focused only on Twitter posts. Therefore, future studies may focus on other social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. Lastly, this study only considered the European context, while further research could be addressed by considering other continents as well as making comparative analysis across continents.
