The high seas deserve particular attention since they suffer from a number of regulatory shortcomings due to the basic structures set out under international law. Against this backdrop, developing and agreeing on a focussed Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) specifically for the Ocean and Coasts could prove to be an essential element to provide guidance and a framework for regional implementation agreements.   Keywords High seas  Areas beyond national jurisdiction  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Sustainability    The high seas — the largest part of the ocean׳s waters — are a global common where access to ocean resources and functions for all people, regardless of nationality and geographical location is largely unrestricted. Thus, their health and functioning should be a core interest of the international community, together with the coastal and ocean waters under national jurisdiction. Ocean currents connect the high seas with all coastal environments and societies worldwide. The oceans host the world׳s largest connected ecosystem, providing humans with essential life supporting functions and amenities. Beyond regulating our climate, the oceans are also expected to provide an increasing amount of energy, food and materials to societies worldwide in the coming years. Accordingly, environmental sustainability for the ocean is of universal concern. This calls for a corresponding global forum for the formulation of sustainable development targets, supported by indices, ocean policies and monitoring mechanisms to measure their success. However, governance of the high seas suffers from a number of regulatory shortcomings due to the basic structures set out under international law. Certain legal principles like the freedom of the high seas and the focus on flag-state jurisdiction seem to obstruct new and more effective legal approaches to safeguarding sustainability. Moreover, while the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) builds an overarching legal framework, specific questions concerning the management of marine resources, the protection of marine species and the regulation of certain activities on the high seas (such as shipping) are addressed by a patchwork of more specific international conventions and policy instruments1  1 Example 1972 Helsinki Convention, 1992 OSPAR Convention, 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, 1973 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOS Convention), 1972 London Dumping Convention and Protocol (1996), 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and Protocol (1978), 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, IMO Maritime Conventions, 1992 EU Habitats Directive, 2008 EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, 2009 EU Birds Directive.   at the global and regional levels. Against this background, the development of and commitment to a focused Sustainable Development Goal  (SDG ) for the ocean and coasts could trigger greater international cooperation towards an agreed and more coherent governance framework for improved compliance and management practices that can be implemented at the national level. Regional and flag state actions are desirable, as these can help to field-test different approaches and are able to take region-specific issues into account. However, because of ocean connectivity, they are most effective when embedded in a global framework of goals and targets. There is growing recognition that the current international law of the sea should be reformed in light of implementation issues and alleged gaps arising from new challenges not foreseen as UNCLOS was negotiated. The prevention of overfishing, questions related to climate change, specific regulation of activities in polar waters, and enforcement competences by States other than the flag-State are just a few issues where UNCLOS has proved in need of further substantiation. Notwithstanding its weaknesses, UNCLOS nonetheless deserves credit for its comprehensiveness and integrative character despite having been negotiated such a long time ago. It is unlikely that the international community will undertake another endeavor of this scale, at least in the present decade. Moreover, any attempt to negotiate and agree upon a new “constitution for the ocean” may pose a risk to the current stability of the system as re-opening the discussion would also involve a re-examination of regulations that currently function well and are not necessarily in need of reform. Therefore, an emphasis on the interpretation and potential extension of the current international law of the sea in conjunction with the legal frameworks for climate change, international shipping, and the conservation of biological diversity, as well as the design and implementation of adequate sized marine protected areas, appears to be a crucial element in sustainable ocean development and governance. Piecemeal national and regional approaches and policies can neither effectively address the difficulties the ocean faces in a coherent manner nor monitor global progress toward sustainable ocean governance. Given that it is the only international organization with universal membership, the United Nations (UN) is well positioned to take the lead in supporting ocean sustainability. The idea to shape the post-2015 development agenda using a set of SDGs has emerged from the recent UN Conference on Sustainable Development (known as the “Rio+20 Conference”), where member states agreed to launch a process to define such goals. These goals are expected to be based on Agenda  21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation  and to build on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The ocean received significant attention in the 2012 Rio+20 declaration: “The Future We Want”,2  2 The Future We Want: Outcome document adopted at Rio+20 http://www.uncsd2012.org/content/documents/727The%20Future%20We%20Want%2019%20June%201230pm.pdf .   demonstrating increased awareness of ocean issues in the global dialog. The establishment of a specific and focused SDG Ocean and Coasts, although legally non-binding, would give new impetus to international cooperation, underpinning the negotiations required to protect the marine environment and promote the sustainable use of marine resources in a way that meet the needs of present and future generations. The implementation of an SDG Ocean and Coasts would encourage the development of new legally binding instruments, as well as the modification and extension of existing legal instruments. Moreover, an SDG Ocean and Coasts  would provide a foundation for monitoring the implementation of current and future international targets for all maritime zones, including areas beyond national jurisdiction (i.e. the high seas and the deep seabed beyond the continental shelves) and gauging compliance with internationally-agreed obligations. Finally, the implementation of an SDG Ocean and Coasts  would allow the integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and therefore overcome the deficits of sector-specific goals or approaches which have characterized ocean governance until now. In contrast, the MDGs have devoted little explicit attention to the ocean. They have also been criticized for placing only limited emphasis on the economic and ecological dimensions of sustainable development, thereby neglecting the importance of sound natural resource management for poverty alleviation. For further comparison, existing management approaches in the fisheries sector, for example, pay too little attention to the social dimension of natural resource management, critical to issues relating to food supply, food security, human welfare and social justice, in general. Consequently, integrating the three dimensions of sustainability is an essential element in understanding, developing, managing, and sustaining blue wealth and simultaneously accomplishing three of the MDGs: 1 (eradicate extreme poverty and hunger), 7 (ensure environmental sustainability), and 8 (develop a global partnership for development). Certainly, the number of SDGs must be limited because every specific SDG comes at the cost of lowering attention to other goals. For that reason, the goals set out in the SDGs should not only be essential for sustainable development but also achievable. While many other global challenges and relevant areas can be addressed using a combination of specific approaches, the challenge of sustaining blue wealth requires by definition a global framework within which local solutions can be effectively implemented. The global framework must therefore include harmonization mechanisms to ensure that the sum of activities collectively represent a holistic approach. Most countries have based parts of their economic and social development on healthy and productive coasts and the ocean. For many countries, this blue wealth is already of crucial importance now and will become even more so looking towards the future. Significant gains in terms of wealth and poverty alleviation can be expected from ocean sustainability strategies seeking to protect marine biodiversity and secure equitable access to ocean resources while wisely managing their utilization, and reducing marine pollution. To be effective, an SDG Ocean and Coasts  must be specific with respect to goals, targets, indicators and instruments. Visbeck et al. [1]  have suggested the following goal: “Secure blue wealth by ensuring a healthy and productive marine environment with all basic provisioning , support , regulation , and cultural services. Provide equitable access to ocean resources , and ensure that neither pollution nor the harvesting and extraction of animate and inanimate resources impair the basic functions of the ecosystem. Facilitate the development of sustainable and resilient coastal communities. Harmonize national and regional maritime policies , and encourage cooperation in coastal and global marine spatial planning ”. They also provide a list of overarching targets:(1) Ensure the basic life-sustaining and regulating functions of the ocean (oxygen production, key processes in the climate system and in the hydrological cycle).  (2) Ensure a healthy and productive marine environment to sustain all provisioning and non-provisioning (i.e. supporting and regulating) services of ocean and coasts.  (3) Use mitigation and adaptation strategies, innovation, and sustainable development to build resilient coastal communities by sharing benefits and responsibilities.  (4) Engage in integrated, multi-level, transparent, and effective ocean governance.    Each of these targets is accompanied by several specific recommendations. In reference to ocean governance, Visbeck et al. [1]  recommend:(a) the development of a globally consistent framework for marine spatial planning within exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and in areas beyond national jurisdiction, including links to coastal planning and management;  (b) the improvement and harmonization of legal frameworks for ocean and coasts, taking into account current and future uses and a balancing of interests; and  (c) the harmonization of ocean and coastal governance regimes.    However, progress towards these targets, in particular, and towards sustainable ocean development, in general, must be defined, monitored, and assessed. The ocean health index recently proposed by Halpern et al. [2]  could be a first step in this direction, providing the basis for the development of more consistent, comprehensive and complete sets of indicators which should be part of the overall SDG process [3] . However, advances in ocean governance to improve ocean sustainability need to be initiated, developed and implemented at the national and regional levels. When compared to the challenges of protecting the environment and securing ecosystem services in the terrestrial environment, it must be underlined that the global connectivity of the ocean requires more international coordination in order for regional approaches to be effective. We therefore argue strongly for a two-pronged approach to sustainability challenges in the oceans: advancing a single (legal) international framework on sustainable development for the ocean and coasts within which regional implementation agreements are embedded and encouraged.
