               Water remains fundamental to international welfare, whether it be in developing or developed countries. Progress in sustainably providing water benefits can be measured in economic terms in the role of water in meeting Goal 8 of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This relates to the “promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth for productive work and decent employment for all.” The latter part of SDG 8 has an equality component, meaning it also requires a simultaneous achievement of SDG 10: “reduce inequalities between and within countries.” This chapter discusses how this can achieved in economic terms when the role of water in the ecology is considered in concert with the need to fairly distribute water benefits. It concludes that applying the principles of ecological economics, fairness, distributive, and procedural justice through an institutional economic framework will create a template for progress on both SDGs.

For example, ancient Egyptian societies were founded upon the channeling of the Nile for transport, irrigation, building, military, and symbolic purposes. The river and its management remains a central focus for the national governments in this region, as water distribution and the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) dam on the Blue Nile upstream of Egypt by the Ethiopian government remains a contentious issue (Smith, 2021 ). The harnessing of water resources and the construction of dams during the 19th and 20th centuries in now developed Western countries provided the foundation for irrigated agriculture, the development of cities, industry, and the provision of transport. Water has been fundamental to economic growth (Mukherjee & Dash, 2024 ). Water resources development has remained the key for growth to the current day, whether it be the development of mega dam projects in China, or proposals for new dams or groundwater development projects to underpin irrigation in regional Australia. The relationship between water supply and the economy varies according to local availability and the developmental needs of the particular nation. How water resources are managed depends on the political economy and water relevant cultures of each country and the sharing arrangements required within multinational water basins, among other things. For countries with well-developed water resources, attention over the last 50 or more years has turned to the consequences of this development. Issues, such as water quality, environmental degradation, need for demand management, and reallocation, and the challenges mounted by climate change, have preoccupied water planners. Wider issues relating to water-dependent quality of life have become the focus of attention. Water reform has been driven by the goals of sustainability and water use efficiency. In many cases, markets have been relied upon to achieve efficiency (Crase et al., 2020 ). For developing countries, some of the water-based environmental issues are the same as those for developed countries. But there are issues with sanitation and drinking water quality that require urgent attention among other concerns (Filho et al., 2022 ). These issues go beyond surface water quality. Importantly, groundwater quality, Sustainable  Development Goal (SDG 6), is intricately associated with the health and well-being of the population of a nation. For example, water quality deterioration in the upstream of a river may hamper the economic growth associated with water use in the downstream. In other instances, for example, an increase in groundwater salinity may affect agricultural activities wherever groundwater is used for irrigation. Thus SDG 8 and SDG 6 are highly interrelated. Nevertheless, despite new emphases on sustainable management, the development of water resources infrastructure remains a universally high priority at all scales from the micro to the mega. Fortunately, the management lessons learned from developed countries and constantly developing water supply and water treatment technologies may avoid some of the problems from earlier experience. This is not to say that all of the wisdom for improved water management is held by engineers and technologists. In many developed countries, it is beginning to be recognized that historical practices and social customs can continue to contribute substantially to improving the sustainability of water resources management and the breadth of benefits that can be obtained by them. Furthermore, particularly at the catchment level, there are resilient, culturally appropriate, and community-based institutions that have for centuries sustainably managed their water resources. The principles underpinning such institutions have been identified by Ostrom (2015) . To this point, these institutional principles have been seen to be applicable mostly at a small scale and in developing countries. But these need to be applied more widely in developed countries, especially in areas that have encountered ecological damage and pollution, and which will require the removal of some dams to provide a solution. Sustainability challenges will need to be underpinned by the evolution of more flexible institutions. To do this, a wider conceptualization of the economics of water will be required.  Water and the Sustainable Development Goals Water resources and their management should contribute strongly to the United Nations (UN) SDG 8 “Promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth for productive employment and decent work for all.” The final phrase “for all” predicates the fact that the water economy has a fairness component in that the economic outcome needs to be distributed as evenly as possible. Thus the goal has not only an improved economic outcome but also an equality-based distributive goal as described in SDG 10 “reduce inequality within and among countries.” Costanza et al. (2016)  have used this observation to illustrate the fact that gross domestic product (GDP), the traditional economic indicator of a country’s wealth is too restrictive. Several countries have moved to indices that include “quality of life” and “life satisfaction,” which consider a range of other considerations such as health, safety, and a clean and nurturing environment. This approach is compatible with current discussions that successful water management should, as far as possible, meet the human “hierarchy of needs” (White, 2020 ). In short, it may be better to regard sustainable well-being (SW) as the total benefit that includes these variables as well as GDP in meeting the SDGs. Costanza et al. (2016)  developed a comprehensive systems-based model to assist in the development of such an approach. From a pragmatic measurement viewpoint, Kubiszewski et al. (2021)  observed that the SDGs consisted of 17 goals, 169 targets, and 232 indicators that included 650 development goals if all subdivisions were included. They argue that there is a need to undergo a data reduction process in terms of identifying the best set of indicators that could predict both economics and quality of life indices which, combined, comprise lifestyle satisfaction (LS). LS is regarded as a primary indicator of SW. Their work identified 11 specific  indicators that could provide the bulk of explanation for overall LS. The only statistically significant water-related indicator was that of “provision of basic water services by location.” This indicator is related to developing countries only. At the higher composite  level of indicators used for assessing LS within the SDG framework (e.g., air, pollution of overall Sustainable Development, traffic deaths, manufacturing, and unemployment), water-related issues are also not predictive of overall LS. Interestingly, when GDP was added to the list of predictors of LS, its influence was not statistically significant. This type of analysis does not mean that water management does not have a high importance either for GDP, SW, or sustainable livelihoods (SL). The characteristics of water mean that it is a fundamental contributor to human existence through its innate relationship to everything else (i.e., it is a covariate for them all). From this viewpoint, it is not surprising that water’s value cannot be expressed by GDP alone. But in that case, how can water be viewed in the economic context when SW and SL are considered? The answer is probably that one economic formulation does not fit all circumstances. As shown by Kubiszewski et al. (2021 ), there are clusters of countries that because of level of development, type of manufacturing, biophysical conditions, and cultural backgrounds need to be considered together as discrete groups in the light of these differences.   Putting the market in context One of the central components of acknowledging the significance of economics in water management is the promotion of water use efficiency. This has been particularly the case in developed countries. That is water is allocated to its most valuable use and this is reflected in the price paid per gigalitre. This has resulted in the creation of water markets in irrigated agriculture and water-dependent industries, and a move toward pay-for-use tariffs in cities. Less attention has been paid to the property rights accompanying the instigation of markets. Initially, the setting up of markets tended to be seen as relatively simple. The steps involve separating water from land management, providing a private water right and allocation to the water user, and allowing them to be traded between interested parties. Thus water becomes a “normal” commodity with a value reflected in its price. But as already noted, water has a number of characteristics that have shown such an approach to be too simplistic. Water trading in itself can provide accountability if conducted well (this is hard to monitor and do effectively), but it is only one tool in achieving SDGs, SW, or LS, and markets need to be planned accordingly (Wheeler et al., 2017 ). Physically water moves by itself in the landscape, it is a renewable resource, which has different management characteristics depending on its source (e.g., surface water versus groundwater). Water is not necessarily “consumed” to create a benefit (Crase and O’Keefe, 2011 ). Furthermore, it has to be shared so has an ethical component to its management. Finally, water is an integral driver of our ecosystems. In short, water has to be managed as part of an interactive system upon which human survival depends. In summary, water has an economic role within context , such as a rural catchment. But the design and operation of the market are inevitably constrained by a number of political economic factors. These include existing uses, historically founded inequalities in terms of water access and power, and the culture associated with the nature of water-based property rights. Similar arguments can be seen between contexts . For example, there can never be equivalent markets for metropolitan versus rural agricultural production within countries. Cities almost always can outspend regional or rural communities, which therefore are unlikely to be competitive in an open market (Grafton et al., 2020 ). The conceptualization of markets between countries  is even more difficult. Ethical rather than efficiency arguments prevail in regard to international water sharing. Outcomes as for other property rights–based negotiations depend on relative power as well as fairness considerations (Kahneman et al., 2000 ). Economic consequences are, however, important inputs to deriving agreements. How to account and interpret the import and export of virtual water in terms of international markets for water-reliant primary and secondary industrial products, when considering international sharing, is also a developing issue (Biro, 2012 ). The difficulties in designing markets do not lessen the value of economic analysis in water planning. Standard economic analyses, for example, can use a production function approach, in which the contribution of alternative water management policies and practices to the value of irrigated produce can be converted to dollar amounts (Foster & Brozovic, 2018 ). Thus the potential economic consequences of alternative allocation and land use policies relating to water can be calculated using these estimates for optimization processes (Mukherjee, 2021 ).  Accounting for the water cycle For economic analyses to be effective in supporting sustainability, we must consider their role within the overall water cycle. This needs to consider, for example, the possible effects of climate change on issues such as flooding and dam management, and the ongoing role of water in ecosystem functioning. Economic efficiency has often been assumed to be delivered by water markets. To date, it is fair to say that the coordination of markets and their rules in the sustainability sphere has not been great. While it is possible to imagine a separate market for each phase of the water cycle, this is unlikely to result in optimality and can easily have unintended consequences if not coordinated for multiple goals. A means of incorporating economic analyses and their associated market mechanisms within a system amenable to fairness (SDG 10)-based allocation rules within social systems is required. Some fairness or equity issues are obvious. For example, water access needs to be sufficient in quantity and quality for the basic human needs such as health. But good management also requires attention to the wider benefits relating to fairness and justice within the water cycle. In addition, apart from human justice, there is also a necessity to include the effects of water use and management in a wider existential sense. Perhaps the most obvious of these is the inclusion of the effect of water management on the sustainability of the environment and its associated ecosystems. Retention of water by dams, increased runoff from  urban surfaces, changes in water quality through industry, and over allocation of surface and groundwater can lead to negative ecological externalities that need to be accounted for. This accounting has involved attempts to incorporate nonmarket variables in a dollar metric so that they are amenable to techniques such as a broad approach to nonmarket values has been to identify potentially affected “Ecosystem Services” reliant on water and to attempt to put a monetary value on them (Cheng & Li, 2020 ). There have been two common approaches to quantifying nonmarket values: revealed preference and stated preference. Revealed preference techniques relate to the role of water in consumer choice. Techniques such as Hedonic Valuation (how much extra is paid to purchase a house with a lake view) or Travel Costs (how much are people expending to travel to partake in water-based recreation). Stated preferences basically ask how much people are willing to pay for a particular water policy outcome. Contingent valuation or choice modeling are common techniques in this area, and understandably have provoked much conceptual and methodological discussion (Gunawardena et al., 2020 ). This line of approach has aroused a vigorous debate as to whether such water cycle services can be reduced to a single dimension, particularly a dollar value (Dore & Burton, 2003 ). Some would prefer to deal with such things by regulation, standards, or legal recognition. This has occurred, for example, in Aotearoa/New Zealand where the Whanganui River has been given legal status in its own right and thus can be represented in court when there are public disputes relating to river management. Formulation of regulations, institutional rules, and the development of standards tend to revert back to the political economy rather than traditional economic analysis or market transactions. Generally, this means that the cultural and spiritual aspects of water benefits can be formally recognized in public discourse. Even market transactions are based on property rights that are also derived within the political economy. Many of the key determinants of the outcomes of negotiations in this sphere are based on what is seen by the relevant society as “fair” or “equitable.” Hence SDG 8 and SDG 10 are inextricably linked. In short, water cycle economics need to be embedded within social systems.  Including economics within societal systems One way to assess the economic values is to incorporate them into the wider societal system addressing SW and LS issues. This tends to lead to system-based approaches that can incorporate traditional economic analyses (Biro, 2012; Cheng & Li, 2020; Clayton & Opotow, 2003; Costanza et al., 2016 ). Costanza et al.’s (2016)  “Full World” model of the whole system provides a comprehensive example. Within that model, one increasingly used concept is that of SL. Reddy and Syme (2015)  used the SL approach the human capital model to study the effects of scale on integrated groundwater management in Andhra Pradesh, India. In this study, SLs were said to include five interacting capitals. These were used to predict resilience measured as the number of drought years that the landholder was able to survive. The capitals included Physical capital  (e.g., number of stock), Natural Capital  (e.g., land area, irrigation water availability), Social Capital  (e.g., caste membership, community group membership), Human Capital  (e.g., level of education, family employment, health status), and Financial Capital , (e.g., crop income, farm and nonfarm labor incomes, income from government programs). Two approaches were taken to estimate Sustainable Livelihoods and the interactions between the capitals. The first was a standard probit analysis using the five capitals to account for the variation in SL. The second approach applied Bayesian network methodology to establish the relationship among the capitals, overall SL, and resilience. This approach was able to examine “what if” scenarios for changes in each capital and for differing policies for watershed development. The influence of financial capital (e.g., current income, crop yields) on resilience could be measured via relationships with other capitals. This provides a very useful assessment of where and to what degree traditional economic thought fits in at the local or regional level and how it can be included with social and physical systems in development of water and land use policy. This approach is primarily within developing countries used at this stage, but there is no reason that it cannot be applied to developed western nations. Bayesian networks are not the only, or always preferred, modes of integrated assessment of water policy. There are other tools such as systems dynamics, agent-based modeling, or even cognitive mapping (Zare et al., 2017 ), that can be applied depending on circumstance. Issues such as physical and social scale, for example, will require modification in the approach taken. The important thing is to choose models that can also accommodate economic analysis to SDG 10 issues relevant to the situation. But if the relationship of SDG 8 with the fairness and equity issues of SDG 10 is not included as part of the economic assessment, it will be deficient. So how can these concepts be incorporated? In general, there have been two approaches to this problem. The first is of modeling the distribution of benefits, usually money, and assessing whether policies can be derived that at least in theory, will provide better fair or equitable solutions. The second approach is to focus on the decision-making process itself in a dynamic sense and to  assess fairness in the broad realms of human social behavior. The next two sections provide some examples of distributional modeling approaches and the definitions used by fairness and equity-based water planners.  Modeling fairness, equity, and equality from a distributional perspective Modelers can provide insights into how fairness, equity, and equality can be considered in decision-making. All approaches cannot be covered in this summary, but the description of a few exemplars can provide guidance as to how these issues have been approached (Wang et al., 2007 ). In general, models have been fundamentally based on various assumptions of water sharing goals. For operations researchers, system analysts and game theory researchers “fair” allocations (often equated with equity or equality) are derived as multiple objective optimization problems, often using formulations such as minimax (or maximin) criteria. That is a minimax solution minimizes the largest performance function among all users or activities in trying to allocate resources more fairly (equitably) for the most poorly endowed users (Luss, 1999 ). This requires consideration about what criteria should be used to demonstrate sharing. This may relate to quantity of water, quality of water, or income. Similarly, economically oriented research on water distribution may invoke concepts such as the Gini Coefficient. This formulation is based on the principle of equality in that, for example, as population grows the amount of water available for each consumer would be the same (Li et al., 2022 ). If that occurs then perfect “fairness” has been obtained. Any deviation to that assumption represents a deviation from this fairness principle. Thus water allocation systems can be given a coefficient calculated from one (perfect fairness) to zero. No relationship between population size and how water is allocated would represent a lack of fairness. Different systems can be compared for fairness by the relative size of the coefficient, and this can guide policymakers. There are other indicators of the benefits associated with water use such as calculations in terms of generated income or the feasible availability of water resources (Ozturk, 2020 ). The Theil index is also an example of a general equilibrium model in which in essence the deviation from equality of water access (and income) represents relative fairness (Kumar et al., 2018 ). These indices can be compared and contrasted for a more nuanced view of what is fair (Deng et al., 2022 ). An alternative approach is provided by the idea of Pareto optimality. Pareto optimality is the state at which resources in a given system are optimized in a way that one dimension cannot improve without a second worsening. Mapping optimality enables decisions between the distribution of uses to meet multiple criteria (Null et al., 2021 ). In more recent modeling adopting variations on Costanza et al. (2016)  “whole of world” approach, integrated modeling has been adopted in optimization’s analyses where the goals of differing levels of institution (local, regional) can be included (Tu et al., 2022 ). This is important as the different levels of institutions can quite often inadvertently conflict both in policy and implementation terms, causing unforeseen effects on sustainability and fairness of outcomes.  Working definitions of fairness, justice, and equity The applications of models using these fairness formulations are constrained somewhat when planners interact with politicians, the relevant government institutions, and the communities affected by the decision. The main advantage of applying such modeling is in an ex ante sense avoiding unforeseen social consequences or in an ex post sense by monitoring what water planning has achieved in justice terms. There is a need, therefore, to provide guidelines as to how justice can be best achieved in practical terms. This is unlikely to be an optimality decision, rather one that satisfices (Schwartz et al., 2022 ) most parties. The definitions of the key justice–related general concepts of practical relevance for water sharing, especially, when considering community-based decision making, are shown below. The definitions offered are generic and need to be understood within the framework of relevant philosophical, ethical, institutional, and political factors of the overall decision-making system (Ducrot & Boublanque, 2017 ). For example, trust in water management institutions allows for earlier and more robust judgments of fairness even when there is uncertainty associated with data underpinning decision-making (Hamm et al., 2013 ). Water justice considerations can also be a significant part of water management at village community level (see Fig. 17.1  ). Definitions of relevance to applied decision-making for water distribution problems include the following:Equality : Everyone has the same opportunity to participate effectively in processes to access water or profit from that water.   Equity : This has two weighted components Equality  and Proportionality  (people who invest either money or effort into the water resource receive a higher proportion than those who do not).  Procedural justice : All affected parties are treated impartially and with the ability to have influence in the process (Thorpe, 2018 ). These processes exhibit the characteristics of Equality  within the decision-making system by providing sufficient voice and equal access to process (Clayton & Opotow, 2003 ).  Distributive justice : All parties receive the appropriate quantity of water as perceived by the stakeholders in the water system. Procedurally just  decision-making systems deliver water allocations deliver that demonstrate greater perceived distributive justice (Howard, 2010 ).  Fairness : A summary heuristic that reflects a judgment by participants that the overall decision is Fair Enough  given the particular circumstances surrounding the decision (Gross, 2008; Ducrot & Boublanque, 2017 ). Trust  in the decision-makers also affects this judgment (Hamm et al., 2013; Zhen et al., 2019 ).    Creating the discussion that allows “fair enough” solutions can only be derived through processes that are perceived to be procedurally just. It is well established that procedures that are agreed to be fair will result in greater general acceptance of their outcome (Tyler & Blader, 2000 ). This is particularly the case when water is allocated. Procedural justice is also important when allocation decisions are arrived at via community-based participative processes. While many assume that participative processes increase transaction costs (Dinar et al., 2019 ), well-run processes based on procedural justice theory are likely to create less chronic conflict and thus potentially save time (this issue will be returned to in the discussion of institutional economics below). Through these processes, it is likely that more issues of significance to society can be covered than if these are decided on behalf of the community by professional planner. Fortunately, the basic components of procedurally just processes are relatively well established in many areas of decision-making. Sometimes these components have different labels depending on the disciplinary or sociocultural background of the water planners involved (Grillos et al., 2022 ). While there are no universally agreed lists of criteria for procedurally just decision-making, there are many that are widely agreed. Professional groups such as the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2 ) have been refining these criteria in practice for some time (IAP2, 2023 ). Above all, it is important that participants in the process agree with the criteria upon which each decision is made.  Conclusion: combining economic and justice perspectives to meet Sustainable Development Goals 8 and 10 From the perspective of both SDG 8 and SDG 10 the simple calculation of how much water-related uses add to the overall GDP will not, in the long run, prove to be adequate in regard to long-term water sustainability. This has been increasingly shown to be the case in national reporting of wealth. In the end it is LS that should govern policy. In this case it may be better to adopt the principles of Ecological Economics. According to Daly (1992) , these have the goals of efficient allocation, fair distribution, and sustainable scale . These goals need to be met by, including the dynamics  of decision-making, based broadly on procedural justice and the fairness heuristic. That is the achievement of either SDG 8 or SDG 10 will be dependent on the quality of the decision-making process. While this has been acknowledged by many and is reflected in the long-lasting institutions shown in Spain and elsewhere, modern water reform has tended to focus on efficiency of use. This is understandable given the all—important nexus between food security and water management. The issue of efficient allocation, although described in economic output terms, is embedded in the property rights that are agreed as fair. The concepts of efficiency and fairness need to be aligned if transaction costs are to be minimized and a sustainable resource use scale reached. This can only be attained by the development of appropriate institutions at appropriate levels. The scale problem can be addressed by economic modeling of resource use with equity constraints that cover macro, meso, and micro levels of management (Tu et al., 2022 ). Institutional analyses have also provided different formulations of appropriate scale-related governance. For example, Pahl-Wostl et al. (2021)  described the four core scale-related governance challenges as they relate to the food–water nexus. These are scalar fit, scalar strategy, institutional interplay, and finally the uncertainty associated with these processes in environmental management. Analysis along these lines, combined with multiscale optimization resource modeling, will lead to a greater certainty in regard to transaction costs. Developments in institutional economics (e.g., see Saleth & Dinar, 2004 ; Crase & Ghandi, 2009 ) can complement these discussions. In focusing on efficiency and moderating transaction costs, institutional economic approaches can contribute significantly to meeting the efficiency requirements of SDG 8. This gives specific cognizance of the need to include the concept of transaction costs and provides rational criteria against which institutions and their functioning can be improved. The acknowledgment of the need to consider the interactions among different levels of institutions is significant. Institutional behavior is an important as part of the “economics of water.” This is an often neglected aspect to studies of justice in which the relevant ethical arguments related to water management can be reframed according to decision-making level (Patrick, 2014 ), much in the same way as the issues facing hydrological modeling change according to the scope of the modeling exercise. A good example of applying this institutional economic approach is provided for the Indo-Gangetic Plains and participatory water institutions by Gandhi and Johnson (2020) . Finally, the justice-related literature shows that in most cases optimization will be impossible in practical terms and that distribution issues will be resolved on a satisficing basis (Syme et al., 1999 ). In agreeing trade-offs, economic returns will inevitably be considered. Procedurally, just decision-making in this case will assist in arriving at decisions that are regarded as “fair enough” by the affected society in distribution terms. It must be noted at this point that the minimization of transaction costs should not justify hasty decision-making that does not provide resilient institutional arrangements. Subsequent conflict through lack of procedural justice can exacerbate transaction costs many more times the efficiencies apparently made at the beginning. Nevertheless, understanding and incorporating economic principles will help create and sustain the wide range of benefits that water can provide for humanity. Broadening our economic vista will create much more water literate communities, which in itself aid in meeting both SDG 8 and SDG 10 goals.   References Biro, 2012 A.
