                  Over the past seven years, the advancement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is gaining increasing attention in the African context. Consistent with this effort, the present study aims to review the existing literature systematically to document contribution and methodological gaps. Specifically, the review systematically explores, through bibliometric literature and systematic method reviews, authors, countries, cited papers, journals, author's keywords, topic dendrogram, and methodological choices of papers associated with Africa SDGs scholars. The R Studio software is used to analyze 200 papers on SDGs, authored by 606 scholars and published in 102 peer-reviewed leading sources between 2015 and 2022. The results reveal that SDGs literature in Africa is an imminent study area, and there are two main strands of literature advancing SDGs in Africa: (1) business growth, entrepreneurship, and poverty reduction, and (2) renewable energy, tourism, and ICT. Key findings from the analysis of the papers are discussed, and implications for future research directions consisting of research questions, research methods and designs, and SDGs research are provided.

Handling Editor: Govindan Kannan Over the past seven years, the advancement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is gaining increasing attention in the African context. Consistent with this effort, the present study aims to review the existing literature systematically to document contribution and methodological gaps. Specifically, the review systematically explores, through bibliometric literature and systematic method reviews, authors, countries, cited papers, journals, author's keywords, topic dendrogram, and methodological choices of papers associated with Africa SDGs scholars. The R Studio software  is used to analyze 200 papers on SDGs, authored by 606 scholars and published in 102 peer-reviewed leading sources between 2015 and 2022. The results reveal that SDGs literature in Africa is an imminent study area, and there are two main strands of literature advancing SDGs in Africa: (1) business growth, entrepreneurship, and poverty reduction, and (2) renewable energy, tourism, and ICT. Key findings from the analysis of the papers are discussed, and implications for future research directions consisting of research questions, research methods and designs, and SDGs research are provided.

The 17 SDGs established in 2015 by the UN member states aimed to advance better life globally by 2030 (Adams et al., 2020 ; Abhayawansa et al., 2021 ). The SDGs follow the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), representing the first effort to create policies to advance emerging nations' development (Pizzi et al., 2020 ). On the contrary, the MDGs lead to poor outcomes due to disparity among countries ((Pizzi et al., 2020 ). Thus, introducing the SDGs needs ex-ante estimation to develop innovative strategies to achieve its purpose (Abhayawansa et al., 2021 ; Kühnen et al., 2019 ). Scholarly papers or viewpoints (research and innovation) are the strategies that can help provide reliable implications or strategies for achieving the SDGs (Mio et al., 2020 ). Innovative studies or scholarly papers depend mainly on the methods employed to conduct the research (Soaita et al., 2020 ). Weak methodological choices can lead to biased research outcomes that affect credibility, compromising reliable strategies for attaining the SDGs. Therefore, scholars (Pizzi et al., 2020 ; Mio et al., 2020 ) are calling for more systematic reviews to develop innovative research strategies and advance the SDGs. Moreover, these SDGs have gained attention and endorsement among stakeholders, especially firms worldwide, such as the business, management, and accounting bodies that train high-quality individuals and develop policies that initiate this global aim (Bebbington and Unerman, 2020 ; Gomes et al., 2020 ; Hörisch, 2021 ). Business, management, and accounting bodies are inevitable partners in achieving the SDGs (Ordonez-Ponce et al., 2021 ). Surprisingly, the need to assess and understand the SDGs using appropriate methods remains unaddressed (Schaltegger et al., 2018 ). Most extant literature focuses on developed countries, neglecting developing countries with different economic, cultural, and governance systems (Rosati and Faria, 2019 ). Moreover, the concept of sustainable development is nascent and remains complex for developing countries, given their economic situation. Hence, there again is the need to conduct reviews focusing on developing nations to develop precise SDGs strategies. The recent UN 2021 report asserts that developing countries have not achieved about a quarter of the SDGs. What can be the cause of this? Extant literature has not delved into why African countries cannot achieve most SDGs. Zheng et al. (2021)  argue that this unaddressed issue can be adapted from developed countries and the inability to review in-depth trends of SDGs focusing on only developing countries. Also, recent studies that have empirically conducted systematic literature on the SDGs focus on the relationship between business and SDGs (Mio et al., 2020 ), management and SDGs (Pizzi et al., 2020 ), accounting and SDGs (Bebbington and Unerman, 2020 ), policy integration and SDGs (Bornemann and Weiland, 2021 ), and financial performance and SDGs (Muhmad and Muhamad, 2021 ). These recent studies combine advanced and developing countries' documents, causing extreme difficulties in understanding SDG trends across continents. A developing continent like Africa has complexity and diversity of cultures, ethnic compositions, currencies and geographies variations, and varied political and economic institutional typologies that undergird political transformation and economic development processes. Thus, there is a need to conduct other reviews focusing on Africa to understand better the trends, gaps, and future directions toward achieving the SDGs. Thus, this study provides a state-of-the-art systematic review through bibliometric, thematic, and methodological procedures to identify evolving trends, research themes, methodological choices, and gaps in advancing SDGs from the perspective of Africa. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to conduct bibliometric and detailed systematic methodological reviews to identify methodological choices and gaps in the SDGs literature in the context of Africa. The significance of this paper is threefold. First, the systematic literature review (SLR) within SDGs studies focusing on Africa is relatively rare, especially in the growing SDG scholarships using different methods. To exemplify, the study uses fine-tuning 200 African scholarly SDGs papers authored by 606 scholars, published in 102 peer-reviewed sources in the past eight years (2015–2022). This paper demonstrates one technique of creating a sense of the increasing scholarship on SDGs and contributes to a critical SLR to inform scholarly debates, professional practice, and policy decision-making. Again, the study fills the methodological gap by revealing new methods gaps, choices, and assumptions on SDG studies. Second, the paper systematizes scientific knowledge created over the business, management, and accounting research debates to develop new inquiries, research questions, research themes, or trends using bibliometric and SLR analysis and documents from Africa. The paper, thus, advances previous studies combining two approaches (bibliometric and SLR) using R Studio software  to review new insights on SDGs in Africa. Finally, business, management, and accounting researchers can use the findings to fill neglected gaps in the literature and methodological choices in advancing the SDGs in Africa. The results are vital for those leading SDGs initiatives, research, and innovation to modify and strengthen methodological strategies and options for the achievement of the 17 goals in Africa. The paper follows the following structure: Section 2  presents the method. Sections 3 and 4  report the results of the bibliometric analysis and systematic review analysis results, respectively. Section 5  provides the future research agenda, and Section 6  concludes.  2 Methods and data completion 2.1 Research approach The study employs bibliometric and SLR to map the best practices to achieve the study's objectives using in-depth content and topics techniques (systematic qualitative review) and quantitative bibliometric tools (Pizzi et al., 2020 ; Appiah et al., 2015 ). We followed Mio et al.'s(2020) stages to collect data for the bibliometric analysis. The first stage is the study's introduction (see Section 1 ), highlighting the purpose and objectives, and the second stage conducts the review process and identifies, selects, evaluates, and synthesizes valid thematic issues. The final stage reports and discusses descriptive results and the thematic areas of the study.  2.2 Data Data for the bibliometric analysis is collected by a search of key terms related to SDGs in Scopus. Scopus is one of the largest recognized databases for conducting bibliometrics and systematic reviews (Pizzi et al., 2020 ). The study uses the following search Boolean string to generate the first set of data (or papers): "sustainable development goal*" OR "SDG*" OR "Global Agenda" OR "sustainable development agenda" OR "2030 Agenda" OR "UN Global goal*." The study performed a search string on September 30, 2022, and retrieved a total of 78,450 papers, focusing on the paper's title, abstract, and keywords.  2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria For the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study follows the below five steps to ascertain the final data or sample for the analysis.Step 1 The search string focuses on papers from September 2015 to September 2022 because 2015 is the year the United Nations General Assembly inaugurated SDGs. The study uses Appiah et al.' s (2022) search approach to retrieve data from Scopus, Google Scholar, and international outlets databases to have broader access to quality papers relating to Africa. Step 1 limited the initial search to 37,584 documents.  Step 2 Again, the study focuses on finding the methodological choices and gaps in SDGs research focusing on business, management, or accounting perspectives. Thus, this limits the search to business, management, and accounting studies written in English, thereby reducing the papers to 3,128.  Step 3 Similar to studies such as Sivarajah et al. (2017)  and Mio et al. (2020) , the search for the papers or documents for the study excludes conferences, books, book series or chapters, trade publications, editorials, reviews, and forthcoming articles to enhance quality control. However, SDG studies in Africa published through alternative outlets such as working papers by international institutions, chapters in edited works, and peer-reviewed conference papers focusing on Africa were included. Again, this search reduces the documents to 1,636.  Step 4 Papers that do not consider African perspectives are also excluded. As stated earlier, this study investigates method choices, approaches, or statistics in Africa to ascertain gaps in methodological options that can be used to advance or achieve the SDGs by 2030. Hence, the search in the Scopus database is limited to publications that use African data, and this exclusion criterion reduces the number of papers to 211.1  1 The final search in Scopus uses this string to get the 140 documents.

Step 5 In ensuring essential substantive suitability, the first author reads the 211 papers to select final documents that align with the study's objectives or research perspectives and remove duplications. Mio et al. (2020)  and Sivarajah et al. (2017)  use this inclusive approach to determine final papers. This leads to the final sample of 200 papers for analysis.     2.4 Sample analysis The study uses the Biblioshiny in R Studio software  to report bibliometric descriptive statistics such as the top prolific authors, contributing sources, most productive countries, top-cited papers, and evolving keywords in the underlying field. Also, the study performs traditional detailed content analysis of the 200 papers to identify unexplored research gaps and methodological choices or strategies to guide future studies.   3 Bibliometric analysis 3.1 Sample statistics Table 1   shows the sample comprises 200 papers from 2015 to 2022, spread across 102 sources, with 730 author's keywords, 686 author's appearances, 3.869 average citations per year per paper, and an average of 9.685 citations per paper. Also, 606 authors have published papers advancing SDGs in Africa, where 30 (4.95%) are sole authors, and 576 (95.05%) are multi-authored. This information indicates a high collaboration or team publications (about 3.23) among African researchers researching SDGs. Of the 200 papers, no paper was published in 2015 and 2016, with five papers published in 2017, followed by eight papers in 2018, 24 in 2019, 43 in 2020, and 60 papers each for 2021 and 2022. The increasing trends (annual growth rate) of SDGs studies stands at 0.6438, indicating that studies on SDGs using data from Africa increase by 64% annually, implying an astronomical growth. Moreover, a three-field plot is conducted to show the summary content of the sample, indicating the literature streams used for the study. Fig. 1   shows the result with ten items for keywords, sources, and authors in the middle, right and left fields, respectively. From the author's (AU) field, Simplice A. Asongu is the most outstanding author who explored keywords such as sustainable development focusing on sub-Saharan Africa or developing countries. Most of his works neglected keywords investigating the indicators of sustainable development goals (SDGs), creating valuable gaps in the literature that need to be examined in future studies. In the middle field, extant literature can be classified under six major keywords (DE): SDGs, sustainable development, sustainability, tourism, sub-Saharan Africa, and developing countries. Finally, on the sources (SO), the Journal of Cleaner Production  is the major producer contributing significantly by publishing papers advocating the SDGs. Most studies in the Journal of Cleaner Production  center on sustainability and sustainable development, and only a few are pertinent to the SDGs.  3.2 Top contributing authors Table 2   shows that Simplice A. Asongu, from the University of South Africa , is the most productive author with ten papers. Most of his papers that advance the SDGs or sustainable development in Africa center on inclusive human development, education, information technology, renewable energy consumption, taxation, governance, and inclusive finance. Philip K. Adom (from Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration ), Kaitano Dube (Vaal University of Technology, South Africa ), Vanessa GB Gowreesunkar (University of Africa, Nigeria ), Regis Musavengane (University of Johannesburg, South Africa ), and Godwell Nhamo (Vaal University of Technology, South Africa ) have published four studies mainly on exploring how tourism, aviation industry energy efficiency, national well-being, climate change contribute to SDGs in Africa. Other productive co-authors conducting related SDGs literature include David Chikodzi (Institute for Corporate Citizenship, South Africa ), Colin Michael Hall (University of Johannesburg, South Africa ), Romanus Osabohien (Covenant University, Nigeria ), and Samuel Adams (Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, Ghana).   3.3 Top contributing journals Table 3   provides the top productive journals regarding the papers published per year in the SDGs in Africa. Journal of Cleaner Production  is the topmost journal contributing SDGs research in Africa with 21 research papers, followed by the African Journal of Business and Economic Research  with seven papers, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications  with seven papers, and Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes  with seven papers. Business Strategy and Development, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, and Technological Forecasting and Social Change followed with five papers; and African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure, Cities, and International Journal of Public Administration had four papers.  Journal of Cleaner Production  is one of the consistent journals contributing to sustainability, sustainable development, or SDGs. The data also shows that journals such as Business Strategy and Development , Journal of Sustainable Tourism , Technological Forecasting, and Social Change , African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure , Cities , and International Journal of Public Administration , indicate the emergent and progressing literature in the field in Africa. Out of the top 10 contributing journals, only 2 have publishers from Africa (African Journal of Business and Economic Research, and African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure ).  3.4 Most productive countries Table 4   shows the statistics of the top 10 productive countries based on the total papers of corresponding authors. South Africa tops the most contributing corresponding author's countries with 34 papers and 258 citations, followed by Nigeria with 28 papers and 245 citations, Ghana with 14 papers and 146 citations, Egypt with nine papers and 84 citations, Kenya with four papers and nine citations, and Uganda with two papers and one citation. Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, and Algeria had one paper with citations of 12, 11, 2, and 1, respectively. East African countries dominate the list; however, their totals of 9 papers and 35 citations are less than the northern region, with ten papers and 85 citations, as well as the dominant region. Central Africa regions have no countries among the top 10 productive countries advancing SDGs literature in Africa, indicating the need for collaborative research across African regions to advance SDGs literature.  3.5 Top cited-papers Table 5   provides the most cited-research papers advancing SDGs in Africa. With 318 total citations, the paper titled "On big data, artificial intelligence, and smart cities, authored by Allam and Dhunny (2019) , is the topmost cited article advancing sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). "Enhancing ICT for inclusive human development in Sub-Saharan Africa, authored by Asongu and Le Roux (2017) , follows with 155 total citations. Of the ten top-cited research papers, five are published in the Journal of Cleaner Production,  indicating their immense contribution towards achieving sustainable development in Africa. 80% of SDG literature among the top-cited papers focuses on achieving affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) in Africa.  3.6 Author's keywords The author's keywords analysis helps to investigate the prevailing research trends to identify gaps or stimulate research areas for discussion. Table 6   provides the top 10 keywords used by business scholars advancing SDGs in Africa. The top ranking is based on the following: sustainable development goals, sustainable development, Nigeria, Africa, and developing countries.  However, important keywords such as sub-Saharan Africa , tourism, sustainability, and governance  are other pertinent trends business scholars are focusing on to contribute to SDGs literature in Africa. Fig. 2   (TreeMap) depicts the potential 20 keywords advancing the SDGs in Africa. Excluding the above keywords in Table 6 , other contributing keywords used by African business scholars to explore SDGs include South Africa, Ghana, entrepreneurship, poverty, renewable energy, ICT, gender, institutional theory, economic growth, and others .  3.7 SDGs thematic analysis The study conducts a cluster or thematic analysis to identify relevant research ideas and coupling themes to enable further debate or a deeper understanding of SDGs in Africa. The study finds two main strands or clusters of studies from the topic dendrogram diagram (see Fig. 3  ). We conducted a deeper analysis of the classified strands to create valuable research gaps in the literature that need to be investigated in future studies. 3.7.1 Blue strand: economic growth, entrepreneurship, and poverty reduction The first strand centers on economic growth, and its subdivisions focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. The first strand indicates that most business studies advocating for achieving the SDGs in Africa focus on innovation and entrepreneurship. For instance, Awijen et al. (2022)  advocate that achieving SDG 7 depends on ICT and technology usage innovation. Quagrainie et al. (2021)  also argue that achieving SDG 1 (no poverty) in Africa depends on the advancement of entrepreneurship. For instance, Quagrainie et al. (2021)  investigated how micro-entrepreneur activities reduce poverty (SDG 1) and found that the performance of micro-women entrepreneurship depends on economic resources and earning incomes that contribute to the advancement of SDG 1. Also, Dhahri et al. (2021)  explore how the activities of entrepreneurs contribute to the achievement of the SDGs and found that early-stage entrepreneurship advances environmental (SDGs 6, 13, 14, and 15) and economic (SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12) dimensions. They further found that opportunity entrepreneurship granger causes social sustainability (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10), as well as environmental and economic sustainability. Entrepreneurship drives poverty reduction, economic growth, and employment, and over 90 percent of businesses in Africa are small businesses (Adeola et al., 2021 ; Gyimah et al., 2020 ; Gyimah and Lussier, 2021 ). Therefore, it has become imperative that contemporary researchers call for more research to ascertain the success of entrepreneurs because their sustainability advances the SDGs (Gyimah and Adeola, 2021 ).  3.7.2 Red strand: contributions of renewable energy, tourism, and ICT The second strand centers on governance that has other sub-divisions. One sub-division has keywords such as Ghana, institutional theory, Nigeria, and poverty, indicating that SDGs studies advocate that achieving the SDGs depends on the social products of firms and institutional practices (see Erin et al., 2022 ). Another sub-division focuses on Africa, gender, and SDGs. For instance, Asongu and Odhiambo (2020)  add to SDGs literature by mitigating how inclusive gender education can enhance gender economic inclusion in Africa. The last sub-division of the second main strand centers on how renewable energy, tourism, and ICT contribute to sustainable development or sustainability in developing countries or sub-Saharan Africa. Regarding renewable energy, Asongu and Odhiambo (2022)  examine how governance affects environmental SDGs focusing on renewable energy. They found that institutional and political governance systems adversely affect the achievement of environmental SDGs in sub-Saharan Africa and argue that governments in sub-Saharan Africa should ensure corruption-free and the rule of law (institutional governance), voice and accountability, and no violence in order to achieve environmental SDGs before 2030. Regarding tourism studies and SDGs, Folarin and Adeniyi (2020)  and Soaita et al. (2020)  outline how tourism contributes to the SDGs using African cases. They argue that tourism alleviates poverty (SDG 1) by creating sustainable employment and wealth, accelerates responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), climate action (SDG 13), peace and justice (SDG 16), and can strengthen partnerships among stakeholders across the continent (SDG 17). Notwithstanding these significant tourism contributions, countries in Africa have no unified tourism implementation strategies for sustainable tourism industry in the pre-and-post era of the global covid-19 pandemic that negatively affects the tourism industry. Contemporary scholars are advocating the need to have sustainable tourism implementation strategies through inclusive tourism governance (Siakwah et al., 2020 ), agritourism (Ghidouche et al., 2021 ), women empowerment (Abou-Shouk et al., 2021 ; McCall and Mearns, 2021 ), and tourism education (Agboeze and Nwankwo, 2018 ). For ICTs and SDGs, Vyas-Doorgapersad (2022)  used extant literature and the opinions of researchers to demonstrate how ICT contributes to SDGs in Africa. The study reports that ICT usage and its effect on SDGs is not constantly high and suggests that there should be technological advancement at the individual, unit, institutional, and government or policy levels to implement and achieve the SDGs. These findings suggest a gap in the literature, and future studies need to explore how the role of technological advancement at these levels can help the SDGs in Africa. Asongu and Le Roux (2017)  further suggest an enhancement of ICT for inclusive human development to achieve the SDGs in Africa. They argue that the penetration of the internet, telephone, or mobile phone can increase human development in Africa towards Adams et al., 2020 . N'dri et al. (2021)  and Asongu et al. (2018)  argue that the penetration of ICTs can have detrimental effects on environmental SDGs 6, 13, 14, and 15.    4 Methodological choices The study identified methodological choices in SDGs literature by applying a traditional in-depth content analysis of the papers to identify unexplored methods to guide future studies (Appiah et al., 2022 ). We focused on the main methodological themes used to conduct research, such as research design, sample and sampling techniques, data sources and instruments, and analytical tools. 4.1 Research design Results in Table 7   indicate most SDGs business studies in Africa employ a qualitative approach (n = 97, 48.5%) to conduct research, followed by a quantitative approach (n = 62, 31%) and a mixed-method approach (n = 41, 20.5%). Based on the stated approaches, most SDG business-related studies explore (n = 99, 49.5) to find answers to research questions that have not been studied in-depth. The exploratory SDGs research commonly uses content analysis or interviews to ascertain contributing determinants of SDGs in Africa (see Allam and Dhunny, 2019 ; Dube et al., 2021 ; Siakwah et al., 2020 ; Cottafava et al., 2022 ; Erin et al., 2022 ; Vyas-Doorgapersad, 2022 ). Moreover, 56 studies (28%) used explanatory to explain and understand problems, phenomena, or situations in Africa toward achieving the Adams et al., 2020 . Also, 38 studies (19%) systematically used descriptive research to describe SDGs problems in Africa; however, only a few studies (n = 7, 3.5%) used two or more explanatory, descriptive, or exploratory research to conduct the SDGs studies in Africa. In terms of the time dimension, longitudinal and other studies, including panel, cohort, and time-series studies, record the highest number of papers (n = 111, 55.5%), and the remaining sample used cross-sectional method (n = 89, 45.5%), where Africa scholars collect information from a sample drawn from a population at one point in time to conduct the SDGs research. These results indicate that most African research is cross-sectional and panel-longitudinal studies to examine problems, phenomena, or situations that contribute to or advance the SDGs' achievement. For the research strategy, most studies do not focus on action research (n = 2, 1%) and ethnography (0%) to conduct the research. The content analysis indicates that none of the sample papers employed methods that centered on knowing the global phenomenon of the SDGs from the perspective of its cultural dimensions or social relations. However, 37 studies (18.5%) have used grounded theory by trying to develop a framework or theory to advance the SDGs literature in Africa. Most SDGs research works or papers use a survey strategy (n = 53, 26.5%) to question individuals and then describe their responses for discussion relating to the SDGs. Case studies papers also record 18 papers (9%) where scholars used one or more micro-level perspectives to explore a problem, phenomenon, or critical situation in achieving the SDGs. Lastly, 41 papers (20.5%) have used historical or archival datasets to research SDGs in Africa (see Awijen et al., 2022 ; Erin et al., 2022 ; Siakwah et al., 2020 ; Vyas-Doorgapersad, 2022 ).  4.2 Sample The result shows that most African SDGs studies use non-probability sampling techniques (n = 107, 53.5%) to select samples for data analysis. Business-related studies advancing SDGs usually select convenience (50%), judgemental and self-selection (35%), or quota (15%) sampling due to unavailable data from African regions. For probability sampling (n = 93, 46.5%), authors tend to use simple random (40%), stratified (25%), cluster (20%), systematic, and multi-stage (15%) probability sampling techniques to conduct SDGs studies in Africa. The sample size is an essential feature of research that make inferences about a population from a sample. We used the number of countries to represent the sample size used by scholars in conducting SDG business-related studies in Africa. Papers that were used between one to ten African countries are 156, representing 78%. Papers with a sample size from 11 to 20 record five papers representing 2.5%. Sample sizes range from 21 to 30, 31 to 40, and above 40 countries consisting of ten (11.5%), 23 (11.5%), and 6 (3%) papers, respectively. These results suggest that most SDG studies use few samples within ten countries to examine or explore a problem, situation, or phenomenon contributing to or advancing SDGs in Africa.  4.3 Data sources and instruments Table 7  also includes sources of data and collection instruments used to collect data for SDGs studies in Africa. The result shows that 87 papers representing 43.5%, used hand-collected or primary (raw) data. These studies used a questionnaire (n = 68, 34%) and interview (n = 29, 14.5%) to collect the raw data. However, most SDGs studies in Africa use the secondary or archival source (n = 103) to retrieve existing data to advance the SDGs. Specifically, 60 papers (30%) from African business scholars used data from World Bank and other international databases to conduct SDGs research. Also, 35 papers (17.5%) used policy or internal institutional documents or reports to conduct the research, and 18 (9%) used extant literature to identify SDG research gaps.  4.4 Analytical methods 4.4.1 Qualitative, content, and thematic analysis The content analysis employs descriptive methods to code data and discusses quantitative computations of the codes. Equally, the thematic analysis offers a purely qualitative, comprehensive, and distinct interpretation of data. Based on an extensive review of the sample, 99 papers representing 49.5% used purely qualitative analysis, content and/or thematic analysis to explore existing literature, policy documents, firm's reports, and stakeholders' views to advance SDGs research in Africa. Contemporary scholars such as Allam and Dhunny (2019) , Dube et al. (2021) , Siakwah et al. (2020) , Cottafava et al. (2022) , Erin et al. (2022) , and Vyas-Doorgapersad (2022)  used existing literature and policy documents to identify unexplored research themes and gaps that need to fill to help countries in Africa achieve the SDGs on or before 2030.  4.4.2 Univariate and bivariate analysis Most quantitative studies report univariate or bivariate correlations to explain the relationship, trends, behavior, averages, percentages, and collinearity of variables. Typically, univariate analyses such as frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, pie charts, and bar charts are reported for descriptive or exploratory analysis with no stochastic assumptions. Of the 200 papers, 11 papers (5.5%) employed only correlation, univariate, or bivariates such as correlation cross-tabulation, t -test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon test, and Kruskal-Wallis to estimate the significant drivers contributing to SDGs in Africa.  4.4.3 Regression Regression is the commonest method used in social sciences studies to examine the nexus among variables (Maravelakis, 2019 ). Most studies (n = 47, 38.5%) use multivariate regression to determine the strength (positive or negative) relationship between variables using a cross-sectional dataset. The result shows that 18 studies used ordinary least squares (OLS) in their analysis, and 13 papers used logistic regression, where 4, 5, and 4 articles employed binary, probit, and tobit regression, respectively. Twelve articles also used the generalized method of moment (GMM) and principal component analysis, with four papers to analyze the data for discussion. Other studies also used longitudinal panel or time series data to advance African SDG research. Forty papers of the sample have used this approach in advancing the SDGs in Africa. Eighteen articles use the autoregressive models, and each of the autoregressive moving average models, autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, panel smooth transition models, and clustering models consist of five papers advancing SDGs business-related research in Africa. However, of the sample, two papers employed the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models to advance SDGs in Africa.  4.4.4 Data mining and machine learning algorithms Data mining is a highly effective approach to analyzing big data or artificial intelligence phenomena (Maravelakis, 2019 ). The data collection techniques find dataset patterns, and data mining helps find meaningful relationships among related variables in a large dataset to answer the research question(s). So far, only three papers have used this approach to understand or predict critical patterns or solutions toward achieving the SDGs.    5 Discussion and future research agenda 5.1 Research questions: future directions The review identifies that the increasing number of SDG studies in Africa focuses on entrepreneurship, economic growth, poverty alleviation, tourism, renewable energy, information technology, and sustainability. We note a gap in the literature, and inspired by the extant studies; we proposed 15 specific research directions to advance SDGs. We follow Appiah et al. (2022)  using four-stage procedures to develop a further study agenda using bibliometrics, methodological choices, and content analysis. The first stage is that we perused and reviewed the top-cited papers (refer to Table 5 ) advancing the SDGs research. In the second stage, we reviewed the 20 most contributing authors trending topic dendrogram (Fig. 3 ). In the third stage, we examined the remaining papers in the sample to prevent citation bias. For the final stage, we exempted research questions that scholars have already addressed and changed potential further studies agenda into research questions (RQs). The four-stage procedures lead to 15 future RQs outlined in Table 8  . To better understand the outcome of SDGs, we encourage researchers to investigate the challenges averting the achievement of the 17 SDGs. Additionally, We do not advise just replicating prior studies and examining variations among nations; we recommend that future research benefit from the distinct institutional factors in Africa, such as culture, governance, legislation, and policy mechanisms that connect the advancement of the SDGs. Future studies should explore sustainable business practices and institutional roles advancing the SDGs. Future studies need to expand education for sustainable development that specifically showcase how innovation, sustainable business practices, and technological advancements (such as blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, social media, and robotics) contribute to the SDGs in Africa and beyond.  5.2 Research methods and designs: future direction The study also identifies a methodological gap where recent studies do not use data mining and machine learning algorithms to enhance SDGs research in Africa. Thus, future studies should employ data mining, machine learning algorithms, or predictive models to provide in-depth insights, interactive, and comprehensive contributions of the SDGs targets and indicators estimation for each African country. Moreover, most SDGs studies in Africa used ordinary least squares (OLS), logistic regression, generalized method of moments (GMM), principal component analysis (PCA), autoregressive models, clustering models, and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models to advance SDG studies in Africa. Future studies can also consider predictive regression models such as structural equation models (SEM), multinomial logistic regression, structural breaking models, threshold analysis, lasso, ridge, or Bayesian linear regression to advance the intertwined relationships among the 17 SDGs in Africa. Also, we encourage scholars to employ non-linear regression, such as polynomial and quantile models, to analyze non-monotonic relationships. Few studies in our review used action or case studies, narrative, ethnography, grounded theory, and phenomenology (see Table 7 ). Future studies should consider these designs to unveil the black box of antecedents contributing to the Adams et al., 2020 . Another important issue is the use of large sample size or quantification, which is a key element to theory building (Bob-Milliar, 2022 ). Africa has complex and diverse cultures, ethnic compositions, currencies and geographies variations, and varied political and economic institutional typologies that limit quantification. Africanists scholars should focus on heterodox research methodologies to resolve Africa's complexity and diversity in SDGs research. Indeed, the integral complexity in Africa limiting quantification can be resolved through innovative heterodox research methodologies or interdisciplinary research methods to improve quantitative and qualitative indicators and motivate more SDGs research.  5.3 SDGs research: future directions Returning to Table 5  (top-cited papers), the in-depth content analysis conducted, we observed that most of the studies targeted SDGs 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 8 (decent work and economic growth). Few studies are advancing other SDGs, especially SDGs 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 4 (quality education), and 5 (gender equality), which are pressing needs in Africa. Thus, there is an urgent call to action for business scholars in Africa to address the five critical areas of importance (people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership) by 2030 to accumulate holistic and complete details of the antecedents advancing the SDGs in Africa. Further, we call on UN agencies and policymakers to create a unified SDG framework for Africans to help government, policymakers, firms, and other stakeholders advance the SDGs by 2030. Future studies must address the critical drivers advancing each of the 17 SDGs in Africa and emphasize each goal.   6 Conclusion and implications Since the establishment of the 17 SDGs in 2015, there have been growing studies by business, management, and accounting scholars advancing the SDGs in Africa. Surprisingly, most of these study concept areas are investigated from policymaking instead of a scholarly perspective. Henceforth, there are possible future challenges in research on the SDGs analysis focusing on academic perspective to come out with clear-cut implications towards achieving the SDGs in Africa. For this purpose, we conducted a comprehensive review to map out business-related literature advancing the SDGs in Africa. We employ a bibliometric, thematic, and methodological systematic review of 200 papers, authored by 606 scholars published in 102 peer-reviewed sources in the past eight years (2015–2022), relating to cutting-edge SDG studies in Africa. Using the R Studio software , our bibliometric analysis unveils the top prolific authors, top contributing sources, most productive countries, top-cited papers, and evolving keywords in advancing SDGs literature streams in Africa. Also, a topic dendrogram is performed to identify major thematic patterns in the underlying contributing SDGs literature in Africa for theory and practice. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to conduct a traditional detailed content analysis to identify methodological choices and gaps in SDGs literature. Further, our study is the first to conduct bibliometric and SLR of more than 200 SDGs papers focusing on Africa. The bibliometric analysis shows that SDGs literature in Africa is an imminent study area that contributes to greater prospects for the future scope of studies due to the sudden upsurge in publications. Also notwithstanding, our results indicate that the most productive authors and countries are from South Africa, Nigeria, and Ghana, indicating that there is scant substantial input in SDGs literature. Thus, there is an urgent need for scholars from these and other African nations to contribute to the underlying stream of literature. Thematic analysis using the topic dendrogram leads to two main strands of literature; (1) business growth, entrepreneurship, and poverty reduction, and (2) renewable energy, tourism, and ICT. Based on the detailed content analysis on these strands of papers, we have proposed 15 research questions for future studies as outlined in the study. Additionally, the content methodology review suggests the use of other quantitative analytical tools or models such as data mining and machine learning algorithms, polynomial regressions, SEM, multinomial logistic regression, structural breaking models, threshold analysis, lasso regression, ridge regression, Bayesian linear, and non-linear regression models to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complexity of the SDGs targets and indicators estimation for African regions. Neglected qualitative methods such as discourse analysis, narrative analysis, or ethnography strategies should be used to research SDGs to understand Africa's diverse cultures, ethnic compositions, currencies, geographies variations, political and institutional typologies. Our theoretical implication concerns the need to further explore the contributions of business, management, or accounting toward the SDGs. Although our analysis reveals the existence of two primary streams of studies, business, management, or accounting scholars have not yet fully examined the scientific debate on the subject. Currently, there is no unified framework connecting the business sector and SDGs. Our results confirm the proposition of Pizzi et al. (2020) , arguing that the complexity of business and the SDGs cause difficulty in developing a framework connecting business activities and the SDGs. However, our findings show that an increasing number of academics have started to build a scholarly discussion over specific themes, such as entrepreneurship, renewable energy, and technology. Thus, business, management, or accounting researchers could begin to find theoretical models that connect the SDGs. The current paper is valuable to local and global organizations, policymakers, government, and scholars dealing with business-related issues' towards the SDGs. Notably, this paper helps scholars with unexplored business research areas and methodological choices that contribute to sustainability, sustainable development, or the SDGs. Also, local and global organizations or agencies understand the business impact of the SDGs in the African context that can assist in policy directions and the development of innovative strategies. This review also offers the practice community insights into how business research contributes to the SDGs. Thus, our bibliometric and systematic review provides an opportunity for practitioners, applied scholars, and stakeholders leading the SDGs initiatives to understand the business research trends in sustainable development in Africa.
