                  A large volume of food waste is produced while processing raw materials from the agro-food sector, including shells, skins, pulp, stems, seeds, etc. Disposing of these discarded materials in landfills or incinerators, which have detrimental environmental impacts, is expensive. However, despite this, food by-products may contain nutritional compounds that have a distinct market potential because they are abundant, inexpensive, and readily available. This review article discusses the effect of food waste on the environment and sustainability, with a particular focus on achieving the multiple goals of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) agenda 2030. A detailed process of food waste valorization has been described, starting from the recovery of functional compounds, including polyphenols, essential oils, pigments, bioactive compounds, and carotenoids from food by-products, extraction strategies, characterization, and finally, utilization of extracted compounds in the Food sector, pharmaceutical sector, food packaging and Cosmetic sector which ultimately increase in the global food market and fulfilling different goals from Sdgs agenda 2030.

On the other hand, scientific evidence supports the strong relationships between economic performances, the actions of individual actors in the food supply chain (FSC) (such as consumers, producers, etc.), and the formation of losses and waste. Valorization of food waste would have a direct impact on environmental sustainability because it would reduce the amount of trash that has to be disposed of, and Waste materials would be converted into new renewable resources that could be utilized in manufacturing processes without decreasing other primary resources (Plazzotta &amp; Manzocco, 2019). The scientific literature needs to consider the economic assessment of food loss and waste as well as food byproducts and waste (FBPW). This is because scientific research focuses more on the measurement, prevention, reduction and environmental implications of food loss and waste. Fig. 3 represents the link between food waste valorization and SDGs. Each SDGs has a specific color and these 7 SDGs are directly linked with agro-waste valorization. Zero hunger (SDGS 2) enhances food security and contributes to a more sustainable and efficient food system. Goal 7 helps produce renewable energy sources such as biogas, bioethanol, and biomass pellets. Decent work and economic growth help in the stimulation of economic growth by establishing industries for biomass conversion and the production of biobased products. Sdg9 has an impact on the development and implementation of innovative technologies for biomass conversion and waste management. Responsible production and consumption (sdgs12) help in the recovery of valuable resources and transform them into valuable products. The climate action has a direct impact on the reduction of methane emissions and the prevention of the release of carbon dioxide, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and combatting climate change. Life on land has an impact on sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation by reducing the need for land expansion, deforestation, and habitat destruction (I\u00F1iguez-Moreno et al., 2023).  item S2212-4292(24)01624-9 S2212429224016249 1-s2.0-S2212429224016249 10.1016/j.fbio.2024.105194 282084 2024-10-13T07:56:15.16339Z 2024-12-01 2024-12-31 1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-main.pdf https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/MAIN/application/pdf/bb66016fa40a0504fe67839395260cae/main.pdf main.pdf pdf true 3900336 MAIN 12 1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-main_1.png https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/PREVIEW/image/png/f8977b9264bb060e3f156c5c006e079a/main_1.png main_1.png png 58495 849 656 IMAGE-WEB-PDF 1    1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr1.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr1/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/80761c44d91a4ce5b320e323724818be/gr1.jpg gr1 gr1.jpg jpg 95534 242 535 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr4.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr4/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/cfc8c96091a5bf3c452d118fa6843ea6/gr4.jpg gr4 gr4.jpg jpg 147420 491 535 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr5.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr5/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/e7d3525670b950e297764be6cd53961b/gr5.jpg gr5 gr5.jpg jpg 132281 482 535 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr2.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr2/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/0d6143ca9097bf933de8c9e5792f2a2c/gr2.jpg gr2 gr2.jpg jpg 140295 294 691 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr3.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr3/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/00ddca44e947aace22d23c19ffbcf312/gr3.jpg gr3 gr3.jpg jpg 127650 425 691 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr1.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr1/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/07b86ed60f1cae111ed82b3ba3cd6b5c/gr1.sml gr1 gr1.sml sml 75529 99 219 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr4.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr4/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/04daa5677662bd50761e4bb123f6f481/gr4.sml gr4 gr4.sml sml 81188 163 178 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr5.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr5/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/a269ffe0737a022175b276941dd8805c/gr5.sml gr5 gr5.sml sml 77838 164 182 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr2.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr2/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/8a330d0459fa30da49907c13ccf0a845/gr2.sml gr2 gr2.sml sml 75294 93 219 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr3.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/gr3/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/b9e5a431c3d316a5457f5e2e4fb217d8/gr3.sml gr3 gr3.sml sml 77707 135 219 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr1_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/f1cba687acb30b9649847075b47ba118/gr1_lrg.jpg gr1 gr1_lrg.jpg jpg 278885 1072 2370 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr4_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/0e4f9214d8b5f755f74223a58f2987eb/gr4_lrg.jpg gr4 gr4_lrg.jpg jpg 642030 2176 2370 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr5_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/c053d6af1258ab1aa3692cdbff84c791/gr5_lrg.jpg gr5 gr5_lrg.jpg jpg 599083 2134 2370 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr2_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/e429ebc1e404482548fda019afe92aeb/gr2_lrg.jpg gr2 gr2_lrg.jpg jpg 645820 1303 3059 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S2212429224016249-gr3_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S2212429224016249/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/a30baa91ad25e97e603b8dd9dc5be210/gr3_lrg.jpg gr3 gr3_lrg.jpg jpg 645361 1881 3059 IMAGE-HIGH-RES     FBIO 105194 105194 S2212-4292(24)01624-9 10.1016/j.fbio.2024.105194 Elsevier Ltd  Fig. 1 Percentage of Food Loss for different Food products.

A large volume of food waste is produced while processing raw materials from the agro-food sector, including shells, skins, pulp, stems, seeds, etc. Disposing of these discarded materials in landfills or incinerators, which have detrimental environmental impacts, is expensive. However, despite this, food by-products may contain nutritional compounds that have a distinct market potential because they are abundant, inexpensive, and readily available. This review article discusses the effect of food waste on the environment and sustainability, with a particular focus on achieving the multiple goals of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) agenda 2030. A detailed process of food waste valorization has been described, starting from the recovery of functional compounds, including polyphenols, essential oils, pigments, bioactive compounds, and carotenoids from food by-products, extraction strategies, characterization, and finally, utilization of extracted compounds in the Food sector, pharmaceutical sector, food packaging and Cosmetic sector which ultimately increase in the global food market and fulfilling different goals from Sdgs agenda 2030.   Keywords Food waste  Food by-products  Valorization  Circular economy  Environmental sustainability   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction Globally the food supply is a constant apprehension and a significant scientific demand due to the increasing population, food production, and, mainly, the growing amount of waste generated. Establishing sustainable food systems is imperative to guarantee a worldwide supply of food that adheres to food safety regulations and reduces the generation of waste. This approach stimulates the exploration of alternate food sources while avoiding the depletion of the agricultural sector. One suggested approach is to utilize by-products obtained from industrial processes with valuable food component applications (Barral-Martinez et al., 2021 ). It is estimated that almost 59 million tons of food waste is produced annually in Europe in 2020 (De Jong et al., 2023 ). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that a significant proportion of food products is wasted, and the amount of loss varies depending upon the nature of the product (Fig. 1  ) (FAO., 2019). Fruit and vegetable losses are significant in developing nations at the agricultural stage, but they are mostly characterized by the processing stage, which accounts for 25% of losses (Ahmad et al., 2023 ). A substantial volume of waste is produced while processing raw materials in the Agro-food sector, including stem, Pulp, skins, shells, and seeds, among other byproducts. Disposing of these discarded materials in landfills or incinerators, which have detrimental environmental impacts, is expensive. However, despite this, Agri-waste products may include nutritious substances that have a distinct market potential because they are abundant, inexpensive, and readily available (Mármol et al., 2021 ). Food waste and food by-products, typically considered to have little value, possess significant potential for synthesizing valuable compounds. Valorizing these materials not only entails the extraction of additional nutrients or bioactive components but also mitigates the environmental consequences linked with the disposal of these so-called "waste" materials (Socas-Rodríguez et al., 2021 ) (Table 2 ). The agri-food industry has developed new procedures in the previous few decades due to societal demands and the demands of various legislative agencies. These processes enable the reclamation of food waste, and their by-products produced during food items' collection, preparation and storage. This was done to maintain the food chain sustainability (Putnik et al., 2018 ). Various food waste management techniques are included in food waste valorization. These techniques aim to convert food waste into valuable byproducts that can be utilized in the food business or other industrial sectors. Such solutions offer the benefits of using a source that is always accessible and inexpensive, such as food waste, to produce derivatives that have the potential to have a high market value (Plazzotta & Manzocco, 2019 ). A well-defined plan is necessary to value by-products successfully. Immediately following the manufacturing of the by-product and continuing until it is being used, the transformation or extraction of the active fractions and the handling of the active fractions are all critical aspects of managing the by-product. A thorough understanding of the interactions is crucial between substances (or fractions) and foodstuffs before the extracted fractions are added to foods. Because the extracted substance could be used in the food industry, selecting the appropriate extraction method and solvent is paramount. It is also essential to carefully assess the various operations that are involved in the situation (Caponio et al., 2022 ). The objective of this review article is to combine recent research that can facilitate the acquisition of novel insights for the utilization of the by-products generated by the food sector into functional foods, food packaging, the pharmaceutical industry, and the cosmetic industry.  2 Searching methodology A significant amount of time was spent throughout the selection process making extensive use of the Google Scholar search tool, Jane.biosemantics, Science Direct, and PubMed, all of which have access to a huge number of databases. It was possible to locate a variety of articles by employing a number of different keywords (food waste, by-products, green extraction techniques, sustainable development goals, circular economy, etc. These articles were then finalized according to the eligibility requirements (functional compounds utilization from food waste and their bioactivity) and screened using the filters provided by science direct and Google Scholar. Starting in 2012 and continuing until 2024, the most recent 11–12 years of research have been utilized.  3 Valorization and sustainability Valorization of food waste has the ability to promote sustainability in all of its dimensions. It would be possible to boost economic sustainability in two ways: by lowering the costs of managing waste and developing new value-added goods from a source that is both inexpensive and constantly available and by providing businesses with the opportunity to cultivate an environmentally friendly image. Valorization of food waste has the potential to improve social sustainability as well. This is because it would result in a rise in the production of food and would maximize the utilization of resources that are used as food to feed a consistently growing global population. Fig. 2   is the representation of some of the processing methods, products, and potential uses of the valorization procedures that are regularly utilized. This figure illustrates the possible sources of FW, valorization technologies, and value-added goods generated from food waste, as well as their uses in many fields. These products and technologies have the potential to play a significant role in determining the sustainability of the food waste valorization processes. In addition, the product yields are determined by the valorization procedures (stage 1 and/or stage 2), pretreatments, and the different types of FW produced (Roy et al., 2023 ). In most cases, a high moisture content is present in food waste that results in beneficial effects during specific conversion processes. Processes that fall under this category include Hydrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), anaerobic digestion (AD), and fermentation etc. On the other hand, there are instances in which food waste needs size reduction or pretreatment (via the utilization of ultrasound, microwaves, pulsed electric fields, and other comparable techniques) to improve the conversion process and extract a greater quantity of products with added value (Fritsch et al., 2017 ). Following the Directive 2008/98/EC on waste, a byproduct is defined as a substance that is produced as a result of a manufacturing process and has the ability to be used further following conventional industrial processing, except for any adverse consequences on human health or the environment. On the other hand, scientific evidence supports the strong relationships between economic performances, the actions of individual actors in the food supply chain (FSC ) (such as consumers, producers, etc.), and the formation of losses and waste. Valorization of food waste would have a direct impact on environmental sustainability because it would reduce the amount of trash that has to be disposed of, and Waste materials would be converted into new renewable resources that could be utilized in manufacturing processes without decreasing other primary resources (Plazzotta & Manzocco, 2019 ). The scientific literature needs to consider the economic assessment of food loss and waste as well as food byproducts and waste (FBPW). This is because scientific research focuses more on the measurement, prevention, reduction and environmental implications of food loss and waste. Fig. 3   represents the link between food waste valorization and SDGs. Each SDGs has a specific color and these 7 SDGs are directly linked with agro-waste valorization. Zero hunger (SDGS 2) enhances food security and contributes to a more sustainable and efficient food system. Goal 7 helps produce renewable energy sources such as biogas, bioethanol, and biomass pellets. Decent work and economic growth help in the stimulation of economic growth by establishing industries for biomass conversion and the production of biobased products. Sdg9 has an impact on the development and implementation of innovative technologies for biomass conversion and waste management. Responsible production and consumption (sdgs12) help in the recovery of valuable resources and transform them into valuable products. The climate action has a direct impact on the reduction of methane emissions and the prevention of the release of carbon dioxide, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and combatting climate change. Life on land has an impact on sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation by reducing the need for land expansion, deforestation, and habitat destruction (Iñiguez-Moreno et al., 2023 ). To achieve the ultimate goal of a circular economy and sustainable development goals, using agro-industrial wastes as the primary raw material for manufacturing bioproducts is an ideal choice.  4 Functional compounds extracted from agricultural waste The waste products from agriculture and food production are significant sources of bioactive substances, (including phenolic compounds, bioactive peptides, carotenoids, and dietary fibers), secondary metabolites (like terpenes, polyphenols, and alkaloids), minerals, amino acids, and vitamins, etc. (Tsegaye et al., 2021 ). Besides the fact that they are utilized as additives for functionalizing materials intended for use in the food, cosmetic, or biomedical industries, these compounds can also be utilized as dietary supplements (Panzella et al., 2020 ). Fig. 4   illustrates the numerous types of substances which can be derived from food by-products. These compounds have the potential to be utilized as a functional substance for producing a variety of the production of food products, as well as a substance in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. 4.1 Essential oils When it comes to extracting essential oils (EOs), the most common sources are fruits and vegetables. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States has determined that EOs satisfy the criteria for "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS). These oils consist of various chemical substances that determine their characteristics and efficacy as bioactive agents (Khalil et al., 2018 ). Typically, EOs contain monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids, aldehydes, esters, ketones, acids, and alcohols, all of which contribute to their exceptional medicinal, antioxidant, and antimicrobial qualities (Visakh et al., 2022 ). The antibacterial and antioxidant capabilities of EOs generated from fruit waste are mainly attributed to the bioactive chemicals they contain. This elucidates the increasing inclination towards employing EOs as bioactive agents in coatings (Passafiume et al., 2020 ). The ability of EOs to disrupt the activities of mitochondria and cell membranes in fungi and bacteria is a hypothesis that has been put up (Passafiume et al., 2020 ). Further, they interfere with the processes of ion transport and interact with membrane proteins as well as a variety of components found within the cell. Those Enzymes that are associated with essential activities like the creation of energy, the replication of DNA, and the synthesis of cell walls can be inhibited by some EOs (Angane et al., 2022 ). The Extraction of EOs from fragrant plants through the procedure of steam distillation. This procedure involves distilling these plants' flowers, roots, leaves, and fruit peels. EOs have numerous applications and characteristics and are widely utilized across several industries. Recent studies have emphasized the increasing global demand for (EOs) as consumers become more conscious of "green" products. In response, synthetic active compounds are being substituted with organic substances in food products and cosmetics (Truzzi et al., 2022 ). Both the pulp of the fruit and the seeds of the Baobab africano tree (Adansonia digitata  L.) contain a variety of phenolic substances that have been shown to have beneficial effects on health. The extracts exhibited a significant phytochemical diversity and possessed beneficial bioactivities, such as antioxidant and antimicrobial capabilities. There was also a strong link found between phenolic components and the antioxidant qualities that were related with the extracts, as was discovered by the study (Thompson et al., 2024 ). The soxhlet extraction method, using n-hexane as the solvent, was utilized to extract the seed oil from Citrus maxima seeds, which resulted in a yield of 36.04 percent by weight of oil production. The antimicrobial impact of CM-SO and CM-FAME produced from Citrus maxima was investigated as one of the primary goals of the research. It was discovered that these compounds have a significant potential for use in crop and forestry biorefineries for the generation of biodiesel (Sarkar et al., 2022 ). Some essential oils, particularly oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids, can be found in the seeds of grapes, which are another source of EOs. For example (Kovalcik et al., 2020 ) successfully used n-hexane and enzymatic hydrolysis for EOs extracted from the seeds of grapes, which resulted in the production of 4.2 g of oil for every 100 g of seeds. The D-limonene EO, a valuable product, was successfully extracted from lemon peel wastes using steam explosion treatment. This method has the potential to significantly increase yields, producing 4 L of D-limonene for every one thousand kilograms of fresh lemon citrus peel wastes. Moreover, findings have identified citrus leaves as a promising source of EOs, offering a potential solution for waste management in the industry (Chi et al., 2020 ). The Hydro-distillation processing method was used to extract and assess coconut waste oils' composition and functional characteristics. These compounds mainly consist of sesquiterpenes (Umaru et al., 2023 ).  4.2 Pigments Anthocyanins, betalains, carotenoids, and chlorophylls are often utilized as natural food pigments. These pigments are readily available in waste from agri-food and serve as a valuable reservoir for bioactive chemicals (Benucci et al., 2022 ). Additionally, flaxseed oil was utilized in conjunction with ultrasonication in order to successfully extract carotenoids from the pomace of carrots. The findings indicated that the yields for carotenoids were 82.66 μg/g, while the yield for β-carotene was 78.37 μg/g (Tiwari et al., 2019 ). The Soy oil and sunflower oil were utilized as environmentally friendly solvents at the time of carotenoid extraction using ultrasound from pomegranate peels. It was found that the number of carotenoids that were recovered from the pomegranate peels was 0.6134 mg/100 g of dried peels in sunflower oil and 0.6715 mg/100 g of dried peels in soy oil by weight, respectively (Goula et al., 2017 ). A novel technique for extracting polyphenols and pigments from onion waste was introduced, utilizing a green extraction approach (the eco-friendly solvents, such as water and glycerol were used). The primary polyphenols discovered were quercetin and its derivatives, with the cyanidin 3-O-glucoside being the primary pigment. Additionally, the cyanidin 3-O-glucoside isolated from onion leaves demonstrated its stability as a natural colorant in a yogurt matrix (Mourtzinos et al., 2018 ). Pigments were extracted from orange peels utilizing Monascus purpureus  and Penicillium purpurogenum  fungal strains. This process was accomplished by submerged fermentation and solid-state fermentation alike. The findings of this experiment represent that the yields of yellow pigment were 9 absorbance units (AU/g) of dry fermented substrate, orange pigment was 0.95 (AU/mL), and red pigment was 0.58 (AU/mL) (Kantifedaki et al., 2018 ). The research was performed for the physicochemical characteristics of biofilms made from poly (vinyl alcohol) that were improved using environmentally friendly polyols and extracts containing high levels of carotenoid components. Tomato seeds and peels were utilized as substrates for the pigment synthesis of beta-carotene through the implementation of ultrasound extraction methodology. Natural food pigments which are produced from the by-products of agricultural and industrial sectors were offered as a potential option for packaging applications in the bioplastic industry. This method suggested the substitution of natural pigments with synthetic colors (Mitrea et al., 2020 ). The use of natural pigments is becoming increasingly widespread in several industries, including the fields of the food industry, pharmacology, textile and printing industries, as well as the dairy and seafood industries. In the present day, it is not uncommon to see that all of the primary categories of natural pigments are being utilized in at least one sector of the food industry (Di Salvo et al., 2023 ). Microbiological pigments are currently being investigated as a potential replacement for manufactured chemical pigments as a source of coloring agents that are readily available. Compared to the methods that chemists use to scale up manufacturing, the synthesis of pigments by microorganisms can be significantly boosted through the use of genetic engineering. When it comes to the creation of natural pigments and dyes on an industrial scale, microbes bring greater versatility and productivity to the table. The fermentation process has been improved through the use of genetic engineering, and additional research on non-toxic microbial pigments has the potential to transform the economics of microbial pigments (Sen et al., 2019).  4.3 Bioactive compounds Agricultural waste is a vital source of functional substances, which includes bioactive peptides, phenolic compounds, Dietary Fibers and carotenoids (Gong et al., 2021 ). These compounds hold promise for a range of applications, particularly in the fields of cosmetics, biomedicine, and the food industry, where they can be utilized as dietary supplements, and as an additive for functionalizing materials (Panzella et al., 2020 ). 4.3.1 Phenolic compounds The existence of phenolic substances in sources that are easily accessible and inexpensive, such as wastes from the processing of agricultural and food products, has resulted in an increased interest in the recovery and further utilization of these substances over the course of the last ten years. Phenolic compounds are broadly distributed throughout the kingdom of Plantae. Indeed, most of these substances benefit human health (for example, in preventing cancer and cardiovascular diseases). These properties can be mainly attributed to the powerful antioxidant and scavenging activity that they possess against oxidative radicals. These radicals are generated during the conditions of oxidative stress and are responsible for the start of a number of diseases that are characterized by inflammation and degeneration. In addition to their applications as dietary components or as an additive in Functional foods (FFs). Similarly, organic phenolic substances have also proven to be increasingly appealing from a technological standpoint, and this is because they have the potential to be utilized in the different fields of materials science (Panzella et al., 2020 ). These compounds mainly arise from the treatment of lignin through hydrothermal and/or autohydrolysis processes. They are also derived from agricultural and food byproducts like Straw from wheat, distiller's grain, wheat bran, and byproducts from the industrial production of soluble coffee using spent coffee grounds. Additionally, they can be obtained from sawdust and other waste materials generated by the wood industry. These sources have been extensively studied as sustainable and environmentally friendly sources of phenolic substances, which possess antioxidant and antimicrobial characteristics. Consequently, they possess potential uses in different industries (Conde & Mussatto, 2016 ; Fermoso et al., 2018 ; Laddomada et al., 2015 ; Meullemiestre et al., 2016 ; Panzella et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). Worldwide, annual food waste production from grapes accounts for approximately 9 million tons, accounting for roughly 20% by weight of total grapes utilized for the production of wine (Mourtzinos & Goula, 2019 ). Regarding the phenolic makeup, it has been observed that the typical lignin content ranges from 17% to 24% by weight (Teixeira et al., 2014 ). Proanthocyanidins, commonly referred to as condensed tannins are a significant group of polyphenols found in the pomace. They are accompanied by other small phenolic compounds that possess various health benefits, including protection against heart disease, neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory effects, prevention of cancer, and antimicrobial properties. The most prevalent compounds in this group include phenolic acids (including protocatechuic, caffeic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, gallic and syringic acids), flavonoids and hydroxytyrosol, particularly derivatives of catechin and epicatechin, as well as anthocyanins. These substances are frequently extracted and employed as coloring agents in the food industry (Fermoso et al., 2018 ). In addition, the olive oil business produces a significant quantity of by-products, that are especially abundant in Hydroxytyrosol, secoiridoids, and lignin. Hydroxytyrosol is one of the main bioactive phenolic substances that can be found in nature, and it possesses qualities that are both anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet (Goula et al., 2016 ).  4.3.2 Bioactive peptides Bioactive peptides (BPs) consist of protein fragments that offer benefits to the body's systems and human health in general. Most of the BPs have a molecular mass between 0.4 and 2 kDa, ranging from 2 (dipeptides) - 20 amino acid residues. In certain sporadic instances, there have also been reports of longer peptides. Lunasin, for instance, is a peptide derived from soy and consists of 43 amino acids. It has been shown to have anti-cancer and hypocholesterolemic characteristics (Ulug et al., 2021 ). Certain chronic diseases can be prevented or treated with the help of the bioactive peptides that are derived from the food. These peptides have a substantial capability for the advancement of FFs or nutritional supplements (Chakrabarti et al., 2014 ). Table 1    represents different peptide sequences from various food by-products, along with the bioactivity associated with each specific sequence. Free amino acids as well as short-chain peptides including di- and tripeptides, make up the majority of bioactive peptides that are utilized in food formulations. These peptides usually do not comprise those peptides that contain more than 12 subunits of amino acid. Since they are less hypertonic than free amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides have better bioavailability than the same amount of free amino acids. Because of this, the osmotic pressure differential is reduced, which makes it easier for short-chain peptides to be absorbed into the cells. Additionally, several amino acids, including glutamine, tyrosine, as well as cysteine, are not able to be absorbed directly in their free form because of their restriction to soluble in water or low chemical stability (Görgüç et al., 2020 ). 4.3.2.1 In vivo, in vitro and in-silico effects of bioactive peptides In addition to the information that is currently known regarding the influence of Coffee Silver skin extracts on the treatment of diabetes and its adverse effects, the in-silico discovery of ACE inhibitors, antioxidants, and DPP IV inhibitor peptides is encouraging. It may offer new information to their existing body of knowledge. The effect of the biopeptide precursors found in coffee skin (CS) on diabetic patients, on the other hand, should be proven through the synthesis of synthetic peptides. Additionally, the release of the efficient bioactive peptides following in-vitro digestion of the extracts should be further verified (Nolasco et al., 2022 ). Memory molecular pathway in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is altered by bioactive peptides isolated from soy hydrolysates. These peptides imitate the memory loss and neuronal degradation that are caused by hypertension. Both the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with 5 mg/kg (oral administration) and the bioactive peptide VHVV with 10 mg/kg (oral administration) were administered to the SHR animal model for a period of twenty-four weeks throughout the treatment process. The purpose of the study was to examine the levels of molecular expression of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), survival markers phospho-protein kinase B (P-AKT) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) during a treatment period of twenty-four weeks for SHR. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) staining western blotting and immunohistochemical studies were used to show that SHR rats had diminished neuronal degeneration and long-term memory. Those rats that were treated with the bioactive peptide VHVV showed an increase in the production of proteins related to long-term memory and neuronal survival. The administration of the bioactive peptide VHVV orally in rats that were spontaneously hypertensive resulted in the activation of CREB-mediated downstream proteins. These proteins have the potential to minimize hypertension-induced long-term memory loss and to maintain neuronal survival(Ju et al., 2019 ). The study showed that a diet containing soybean protein hydrolysate (SPH) can prevent age-related cognitive loss in a mouse model with senility by increasing the amount of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The objective of the research was to discover new bioactive peptides in SPH that can enhance the demonstration of BDNF. The primary astrocytes of the mouse were treated with SPH, along with its cationic chromatographic fraction. A substantial augmentation in the amount of BDNF was detected in the therapy involving the cationic portion of SPH. Within the group of artificially created peptides, the dipeptide glycine−arginine (GR) demonstrated an increase in BDNF expression when tested in a laboratory setting. Additionally, LC-TOF-MS analysis confirmed the availability of GR in the SPH. Moreover, when administered in living organisms, it resulted in an increase in the number of neurons in both the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex, as well as an increase in the amount of BDNF that was expressed in the cerebral cortex. The results suggest that GR may enhance the process of neurogenesis by augmenting the amounts of BDNF (Shimizu et al., 2018 ). The process involved the use of bromelain to hydrolyze defatted mung bean meal, resulting in the formation of MPH. Membrane ultrafiltration subsequently separated this MPH into many peptide fractions such as (<1 kDa, 1–5 kDa, 5–10 kDa, and >10 kDa). As an inhibitor of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the 1 kDa compound showed the most activity. Five peptides (LPRL, YADLVE, LRLESF, HLNVVHEN, and PGSGCAGTDL) that were found in the fraction weighing less than 1 kDa were examined for their ability to lower blood pressure, in comparison to MPH. The findings indicated that LRLESF had the most inhibitory activity against ACE, with an IC50 value of 5.4 μM, whereas LPRL displayed the lowest inhibitory activity, with an IC50 value of 1912 μM. YADLVE had the highest level of renin inhibition at 97%, whilst LRLESF showed the lowest level at approximately 30%. When orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats, there was a significant decrease in blood pressure, with a maximum reduction of −36 mmHg, compared to −15 mmHg for MPH. YADLVE had the strongest and longest-lasting impact after 24 h, whereas PGSGCAGTDL had the weakest effect (Sonklin et al., 2020 ). Within the context of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the research aimed to investigate the hypotensive effect of amaranth protein and peptide supplements. Both in vivo and ex vivo research were conducted to investigate the mechanism of action of these peptides. A further investigation was conducted to see how the integrity of the antihypertensive peptides was affected by the protection against gastrointestinal digestion (GID) that was provided by an O: W emulsion. A drop in blood pressure (SBP) was observed in each examined sample. The animals that were administered emulsion (GE) and emulsion compounded with peptide (GE + VIKP) exhibited the most notable decrease in their systolic blood pressure (SBP) (42 ± 2 mmHg and 35 ± 2 mmHg, respectively). According to the findings that were given, it appears that following GID, a wide range of peptides that possessed biological activity were either released or showed resistance to this process. By acting on plasma ACE, plasma renin, and the vascular system, these peptides contribute to the regulation of the SBP. This is accomplished by their actions. According to these findings, the incorporation of amaranth protein and peptides into the formulation of functional foods for hypertensive persons receives support (Suárez et al., 2020 ).   4.3.3 Carotenoids Carotenoids possess a diverse array of health-enhancing effects. For instance, they bolster the immune system and facilitate the process of wound healing while shielding against the detrimental effects of UV radiation. As a result, they find use in the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries as well as animal feed. Fruits and vegetables are the main origins of carotenoids, present in both their consumable and non-consumable components. Hence, retrieving beneficial compounds from the FW of fruit and vegetable processing can significantly diminish Food Loss (Kultys & Kurek, 2022 ). Despite synthetic colorants' superior stability and a wider range of color combinations, there is increasing consumer apprehension regarding their potential impact on human health (Oplatowska-Stachowiak & Elliott, 2017 ). It has been reported that the consumption of these substances is linked to adverse health impacts in children, including hyperactivity, irritability, sleep issues, attention problems, and violent behavior (Masone & Chanforan, 2015 ). Because of this, the food industry faces a lot of criticism to get rid of the synthetic colorants that are regularly used in food and replace them with natural substances (Náthia-Neves & Meireles, 2018 ). Three distinct kinds of oils—linseed, peanut and sunflower—were utilized in the process of extracting carotenoids from the mango pulp. The extraction process was facilitated by microwaves. A preliminary enzymatic treatment with pectinase and cellulase was performed on a sample that was under investigation. The collected findings indicate that the procedure is inefficient when using the specified parameters: 100 W power and durations of 2, 4, 6, and 8 min. Because mango pulp has a low value of polar groups, the method may not be as efficient as it may be, resulting in decreased penetration of microwaves into the food structure. Furthermore, the investigation revealed a temperature rise caused by microwave penetration, which could also reduce the carotenoid content of the examined raw material (Baria et al., 2019 ). The carotenoids present in tomato peel were analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to determine their suitability. As naturally derived color additives in sunflower oil and spaghetti. The tomato peel had a carotenoid content of 720 mg/100g. The peel contained various carotenoids, including phytoene (3.15%), cis-ζ-carotene (0.61%), β-carotene (2.11%), phytofluene (2.31%), cis-lycopene (1.71%), γ-carotene (0.52%), lutein (1.51%), cis-ζ-carotene (0.61%), and ζ-carotene (0.56%). The greatest concentration of lycopene was measured at 87.52% (Waqas et al., 2017 ). The Rancimat test and the diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay were utilized in order to assess the antioxidant capacity of carotenoids that were isolated from tomato peel. Carotenoids were added to sunflower oil and spaghetti at 50–200 mg/kg concentrations. Sunflower oil, which contains carotenoids in the range of 50–200 mg/kg, exhibited more antioxidant activity than sunflower oil with 200 mg/kg of Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (Waqas et al., 2017 ).    5 Applications of bioactive compounds extracted from agriculture waste Bioactive substances possess bioactive qualities in the human body unaccompanied by providing nutritional advantages and belong to the category of secondary metabolites in plants. These substances can produce toxicological and pharmacological consequences in humans and other animals (Pai et al., 2022 ). Developing novel substances for medical treatment is a challenging and time-consuming endeavor (Sinha & Häder, 2021 ). This development has facilitated significant progress in the application of a wide range of bioactive substances that are naturally occurring, as well as areas such as ethnopharmacology, which focuses on the organized investigation and exploration of traditional medicinal sources (Süntar, 2020 ). The dried roots of S. baicalensis Georgi  are used to extract the flavone known as baicalein. Because of its antioxidant and anti-cancer capabilities, it has gained a lot of attention, and it has been utilized to cure various gastrointestinal conditions, including Liver fibrosis and gastric ulcers (Xie et al., 2019 ). It has been discovered that Anthemis cotula  L., or stinking chamomile, extracts may be useful for the cure of skin hyperpigmentation and Alzheimer disease (Sut et al., 2019 ). Bioactive compounds have a significant value for the food industry. Bioactive peptides have been displayed to be of great assistance in formulating a wide variety of functional diets focused on health. In food preparation, such peptides are utilized for providing sweetness, color stability, thickness, anti-caking properties, enhancing flavor, and emulsification. Furthermore, they are utilized to manage acidity. In addition, BPs have the capability to enhance the overall quality of food by affecting the final product's ability to retain water and oil, maintain its colloidal stability, control its viscosity, and produce foam (Faustino et al., 2019 ). With the addition of protein concentrates from rice bran into beef products, the emulsion stability and rheological properties of the beef products were drastically improved. This is because there is a higher concentration of bioactive peptides (Zaky et al., 2022 ). In response to growing customer's urge for healthy food, the industry and scientific community have begun developing novel ingredients for use in food and beverages. The food sector has been significantly impacted by the recent pandemic, particularly regarding food safety and security. As a result, the development of sustainable and contemporary food systems has become increasingly crucial (Galanakis et al., 2021 ). Consequently, incorporating bioactive components (polyphenols, Vitamins, Peptides and lipids) into consumers' diets can potentially be an essential factor in either the prevention of COVID-19 disease or the recovery from its symptoms (Galanakis et al., 2020 ). An evaluation was conducted by (Cedola et al., 2020 ; Simonato et al., 2019 ) to determine the impact of incorporating Olive mill effluent and olive paste, either separately or in combination, into bread and pasta. The findings indicated that adding OMWW to bread and pasta led to a slight enhancement in chemical properties without affecting the sensory characteristics. On the other hand, olive paste significantly increased phenolic contents and antioxidant activity, although its bitter and spicy taste negatively impacted sensory acceptability. The combined use of two byproducts in fortifying bread and spaghetti resulted in an elevated overall quality index, with bread exhibiting a higher index than spaghetti. Pastries and sauces are two examples of foods that benefit from the development of foam, which can enhance their tactile and sensory characteristics (Xiong et al., 2018 ). The study revealed that there was a prominent distinction between the foaming capability of the quinoa seed protein concentrate and protein concentrate cake from soybeans (Elsohaimy et al., 2015 ). Meat that had been minced was preserved with the help of the peptide TSKYR. This peptide, obtained through enzymatic hydrolysis with pepsin from bovine hemoglobin, demonstrated the same level of effectiveness as Butylene hydroxytoluene (0.7 mg MDA/kg of meat) in reducing lipid oxidation during storage (Przybylski et al., 2016 ). Multiple researchers have proposed the utilization of liposomes to encapsulate antimicrobial and antihypertensive peptides (Alvarado et al., 2019 ). This approach was designed to address different challenges associated with directly applying these peptides in food. By encapsulating them in liposomes, the structural integrity and functioning of the peptides can be preserved inside food matrices (McClements, 2018 ). The cosmetics sector has demonstrated significant curiosity for bioactive peptides because of their capability to improve skin health and enhance physical appearance (Fig. 5  ). Such tiny fragments of protein possess many biological properties, like antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-aging, and anti-inflammatory activity, which make them well-suited for use as components in cosmetic compositions. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies, along with clinical trials, provided evidence that BPs can improve the appearance of the skin. This improvement can be achieved both through topical application and oral administration. The benefits include skin whitening, moisturizing and reducing the signs of aging. These effects are achieved through various intracellular mechanisms (Ngoc et al., 2023 ). The silkworm species Bombyx mori is the starting point for the production of the silk fibroin peptide. The effectiveness of this peptide in inhibiting inflammation is mostly attributed to the fact that it enhances the anti-inflammatory function of tTAT-superoxide dismutase. It has been observed that superoxide dismutase may efficiently permeate skin cells and tissues and exhibit antioxidant properties in a mouse model with inflammation (Cermeño et al., 2022 ). Acetyl hexapeptide-3 (Argireline®) is one of the commonly used neurotransmitter-inhibitor peptides that has been commercialized. It possesses advanced qualities that improve the appearance of wrinkles and moisturize the skin. This particular peptide, which is analogous to botulinum toxin and has the ability to impersonate the SNAP-25 protein at its N-terminal end and compete with other peptides for a position within the SNARE complex. As a consequence, the formation of the SNARE complex is destabilized, and the release of acetylcholine is inhibited, which ultimately leads to a reduction in muscular contraction (Schagen, 2017 ). Propionic acid is extensively utilized as a preserving agent and as a food additive. Presently, most of the propionic acid synthesis occurs via the costly petrochemical method. Therefore, it is necessary to create economical approaches for propionic acid manufacturing (Sindhu et al., 2019 ). An approach to the manufacture of propionic acid by the utilization of apple pomace was devised by (Piwowarek et al., 2016 ). After an incubation period of 120 h, apple pomace was the only source of carbon that was utilized by the wild strain of Propionibacterium freudenreichii  T82, which can generate 1.711 g/L of propionic acid. Alternative packaging materials have been the subject of research and development as a result of the growing environmental consciousness among consumers all over the world. It has been demonstrated that numerous biomaterials that are produced from bioresources have the potential to be used as packaging. Waste from agricultural production is a significant source of biopolymers and bioactive chemicals. A significant contribution to sustainable development is made by the extraction and purification of these materials for use as alternative packaging (Varghese et al., 2023 ). The majority of the waste generated from natural sources is composed of carbon atoms, which have the potential to be utilized as a source of carbon material. For example, there is wood that can be used for thick carbon electrodes, and soybean protein isolates can be used as a source of porous carbon sheets (Feng et al., 2022 ; Yan et al., 2022 ). The application of amorphous carbon powder into food packaging possesses bactericidal properties as a result of its high oxidoreductive potential. This leads to the damage of cell membranes during lipid peroxidation and the intensification of oxidative stress in microbes, which have the potential to be utilized in active packaging applications (Mitura et al., 2021 ). PHBV-based sustainable food packaging films were made with three distinct types of wheat straw fibers mixed into them. When it comes to the packing of respiring fruits, it has been discovered that increasing the fiber size results in a drop in tensile strength while simultaneously increasing the water vapor transmission rate (Berthet et al., 2015 ). The incorporation of agri-food waste into the diet of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor ) promotes sustainable insect production, thereby reducing the economic and environmental problems associated with waste disposal (Kotsou et al., 2024 ). Agri-food waste is abundant in proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and vitamins, as well as other bioactive compounds. All of these nutrients are essential for the growth and development of insects. In an effort to further optimize the circular economy while improving the nutritional content of the insects, waste extracted from Albedo orange peel was utilized as a feed additive for T. molitor  larvae. For this purpose, bran, which is often utilized as a source of nutrition for T. molitor  larvae, was enriched with the waste from albedo orange peels at a weight-to-weight ratio of up to 25 percent (Kotsou et al., 2023 ).  6 Challenges and future perspective Food proteins can undergo changes that may lead to the production of toxic and allergenic peptides. These changes can occur because of the sensitivity of amino acids to environmental conditions and hydrolysis. Additionally, the interaction of peptides with the food matrix while processing and storage can form unwanted compounds like nitrosamines, acrylamide, and biogenic amines. It is still uncertain whether other bioactive compounds in food, such as secondary metabolites, can impact the safety of BPs. Furthermore, BPs are only recognized as helpful when consumed in standard amounts. Consuming them in higher doses over a prolonged period, especially for individuals who are sensitive or allergic, may lead to serious adverse effects. When evaluating oral products, it is crucial to thoroughly assess their specified characteristics and the bioavailability features of their active ingredients. This includes considering both their physiological effects and their capacity to maintain their structural stability during digestion, transport, and absorption in the intestines. When taken orally, these peptides are broken down in the digestive system by the enzymes found in the lining of the stomach and, small intestine, as well as the acidity of the stomach (Udenigwe & Fogliano, 2017 ). Despite the existing knowledge regarding the structure and action of peptides, further investigation is necessary to establish a stronger connection between these two elements. Additional research is required to examine the stability of peptide activity and its regulatory mechanisms, as well as to isolate bioactive peptides and assess their potential bioactivity. Furthermore, it is necessary to organize pre-clinical and clinical investigations to ascertain the optimal amounts of these substances for promoting good health. These studies should also examine the relationship between dosage and response, the extent to which these substances can be absorbed by the body, pharmacokinetics and whether they can be ingested with food. A good reason to be optimistic about the potential applications of essential oils and pigments in the fields of agriculture, cosmetics, and health care is due to the natural antibacterial and therapeutic qualities that they possess. One of the obstacles, however, is overcoming the fluctuation in composition that is caused by environmental influences. Other challenges include sustainable sourcing, quality control, stability, regulatory hurdles, and stability. Because of their antioxidant and antibacterial qualities, phenolics have the potential to be useful in a variety of industries, including the pharmaceutical industry, the food industry, and the bio-based materials industry. Possible areas of attention for future study include the improvement of extraction techniques, the enhancement of bioavailability, and the expansion of sustainable sources. One of the hurdles, however, is assuring their stability and effectiveness in a variety of applications. Other challenges include scalability, environmental issues around synthetic production, and maintaining their effectiveness.  7 Conclusion The processing of food raw materials results in the generation of a significant amount of food waste, and the disposal of these discarded products in landfills or incinerators, both of which have negative effects on the environment, presents a significant financial burden. However, despite this, food by-products may include nutritional substances that are beneficial to one's health and have a particular market potential due to the fact that they are abundant, inexpensive, and easily accessible. The process of food waste valorization has been described in detail. The process begins with the recovery of functional compounds from food by-products, such as polyphenols, essential oils, pigments, bioactive compounds, and carotenoids. Moving on to extraction strategies, characterization, and finally, the utilization of extracted compounds in the food industry, pharmaceutical industry, food packaging industry, and cosmetic industry, which ultimately leads to an increase in the global food market and fulfills various goals from the sustainable development goals (SDGs) agenda 2030. However, some possible areas of attention for future study include the improvement of extraction techniques, the enhancement of bioavailability, sustainable sourcing, quality control, stability, regulatory hurdles, and stability and the expansion of sustainable sources. One of the hurdles, however, is assuring their stability and effectiveness in a variety of applications. Other challenges include scalability, environmental issues around synthetic production, and maintaining their effectiveness.
