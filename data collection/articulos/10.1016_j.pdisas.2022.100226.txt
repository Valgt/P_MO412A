                  Humans, always, have tamed nature to meets their needs and demands. The contemporary cities are a consequence of that. The agglomeratic nature of these cities have enabled them to thrive over the surrounding rural areas. This process of urbanization has always come at a price. As cities have progressed to be larger and more complex growth engines, they have become vulnerable and susceptible to disasters, with climate change further exacerbating the status quo.
                  Resilience is a system's innate ability to resist a drastic change in its surrounding, and to bounce back after experiencing a period of stress. Studying resilience helps to understand the vulnerability of these urban centres and enable them to increase their capacity to bounce back. While sustainability is seen as the goal to achieve, resilience is the capability to strengthen the pathway to sustainability.
                  Master plans for cities have helped streamline the process of development by understanding the convoluted interrelationship between the various aspects of the cities and provide balanced solutions to meet the goals of development. A Resilience Master Plan affirms to improve the Resilience of the City while also ensuring the city meets the targets of sustainable development, in a systematic manner.
                  Genesis of modern civilization in India began when Vasco da Gama landed on the shores near Kozhikode City, Kerala. Kozhikode plays a significant role in the development of the entire region. In the recent times, the city has been vulnerable to disasters of various kinds, including Floods and Epidemics.
                  The study delves into the concept of Resilience and Resilience Master Plan, appraise the existing Master Plan of Kozhikode, assimilate the Resilience of Kozhikode City, and suggest methods to help increase of the Resilience of the city, while achieving the goals of development in a sustainable manner.

Humans, always, have tamed nature to meets their needs and demands. The contemporary cities are a consequence of that. The agglomeratic nature of these cities have enabled them to thrive over the surrounding rural areas. This process of urbanization has always come at a price. As cities have progressed to be larger and more complex growth engines, they have become vulnerable and susceptible to disasters, with climate change further exacerbating the status quo. Resilience is a system's innate ability to resist a drastic change in its surrounding, and to bounce back after experiencing a period of stress. Studying resilience helps to understand the vulnerability of these urban centres and enable them to increase their capacity to bounce back. While sustainability is seen as the goal to achieve, resilience is the capability to strengthen the pathway to sustainability. Master plans for cities have helped streamline the process of development by understanding the convoluted interrelationship between the various aspects of the cities and provide balanced solutions to meet the goals of development. A Resilience Master Plan affirms to improve the Resilience of the City while also ensuring the city meets the targets of sustainable development, in a systematic manner. Genesis of modern civilization in India began when Vasco da Gama landed on the shores near Kozhikode City, Kerala. Kozhikode plays a significant role in the development of the entire region. In the recent times, the city has been vulnerable to disasters of various kinds, including Floods and Epidemics. The study delves into the concept of Resilience and Resilience Master Plan, appraise the existing Master Plan of Kozhikode, assimilate the Resilience of Kozhikode City, and suggest methods to help increase of the Resilience of the city, while achieving the goals of development in a sustainable manner.   Keywords Urban resilience  Resilience master plan  Disaster risk reduction  Disaster preparedness & mitigation  Sustainable development    1 Introduction Resilience is the ability of a system to withstand any disturbance and return to the original state. The concept of Resilience in ecological systems was identified by Canadian Ecologist C S Holling to better understand persistence of natural systems, which have been constantly affected by human activities in the recent centuries [9 ]. Applying resilience to cities helps understand how to make them stronger to any perturbation and reduce expenditure to rebuild them again, while also reducing the impact on its citizens. Resilience is greatly affected by the city's governance and their infrastructure [18 ]. 1.1 Need for resilience About 70% of the world is expected to live in cities by 2050, from about 14% in the beginning of the 20th century. While the concentration in urban areas is what propels its growth, it comes with a significant caveat. With climate change, these cities are more stressed than ever, with the poorer sections being more vulnerable. The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) estimates that disasters cost cities US$314 billion annually. Resilient cities are the need of the hour to combat poverty and climate change [26 ]. By 2030, it has been projected that about 325 million people are expected to live in 49 countries, exposed to natural hazards and climate extremes in South Asian and Sub-Saharan Africa [22 ]. Recent frameworks like Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 11) and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 have prioritized Resiliency and Disaster Risk Reduction.  1.2 Location of project The area under consideration is Kozhikode Municipal Corporation, referred to as Kozhikode City (See Fig. 1 ). Kozhikode city, also known as Calicut, is in the northern region of the State of Kerala. It is a city of regional significance, and the third largest city in Kerala, and the district headquarters of Kozhikode District. The city, in the recent years has started to feel the effects of climate change. The city has also faced massive disasters lately, including floods and epidemics, and has one of the most comprehensive Master Plans of the state which makes it ideal for this study .  1.3 Project parameters The aim of the study is to make Kozhikode city a resilient city, providing a safe and liveable environment, by formulating a Resilience Master Plan. The objective of this study includes to understand the concept of Urban Resilience and its aspects, to appraise the Master Plan of Kozhikode city in relation to Resilience, to be cognizant of the various Government frameworks and guidelines which embolden Resilience, to study the various sectors of the city to understand its current scenario and its resilience, to assess the resilience of the city, and finally, reformulate a Master Plan for Kozhikode City with focus on Resilience to achieve Sustainable development (See Fig. 2 ) . The study is limited to examination of resilience using various dimensions and its indicators, and the area of study is limited to the Kozhikode Corporation area, and various kinds of disasters that are possible within the study area.   2 Introduction to urban resilience This section is an introduction to Resilience and Urban resilience and about their various aspects. 2.1 Introduction to resilient systems Resilient systems have the following qualities that makes them resilient. Reflectiveness is the inherent property of the system to accept the changes that are occurring in today's world. Robustness is the system's ability to withstand the stresses. Redundancy is the ability of the system to use spare resources in case of an emergency. Flexibility is the system's ability to adapt easily to any change or transformations. Resourcefulness means the ability of the inhabitants to meet their goals and target with the available resources. Inclusiveness means the inclusion of all in the decision-making processes. Integrity refers to the alignment of the decision makers and the needs to the system [27 ]. Resilient systems can be classified from an individual who is knowledgeable and skilled, to a household, to that of a Community, Local government, National Level, Regional Level, or Global Level. Resilient communities share some common traits which they developed over time. These communities are knowledgeable, healthy and can meet its basic needs, are socially cohesive, have economic opportunities, developed well-maintained and accessible infrastructures and services, can manage its natural assets, and are well connected [27 ].  2.2 Urban resilience Urban systems are complex conglomeration of various ecological, social, and technical components. In the recent years, with rapid globalisation globally, the number of interactions between these urban centres and hinterlands have increased dramatically, with the exchange of materials, water, energy, capital, making them highly interdependent, and thus making their demarcation problematic as some of these mechanism extent beyond the city limit [5 ,16 ]. Urban resilience refers to the ability of an urban system and all its constituent socio-ecological and socio-technical networks across temporal and spatial scales to maintain or rapidly return to desired functions in the face of a disturbance, to adapt to change, and to quickly transform systems that limit current or future adaptive capacity [16 ]. This definition indicates that Urban Resilience is dynamic in nature and that there are multiple ways to achieve the same. Cities which do not plan, or are unable to recover, will accumulate the negative stresses will eventually crumble and fail its people. To assimilate urban resilience of a place, it is important to define the various dimensions which are to be explored. Ideally, these dimensions must be ascertained contextually. But to ensure that all aspects have been considered, the following dimensions, namely, Materials and Environmental Resources, Society and Well-Being, Economy, Built Environment and Infrastructure, Governance, and Institutions, must be considered [2 ]. Resilient systems can attain one of following states of equilibrium. First is Single state equilibrium, in which the system returns to the original state after perturbations have passed. Next is Multiple-State Equilibrium in which the system has multiple stable states and during a disturbance, it switches from one stable state to another. The third is Dynamic non-equilibrium, in which the system does not have a stable state and is constantly evolving, which has challenged the traditional idea of resilience in the recent years and moved the concept of resilience from bouncing back [8 ]. To reach a resilient state, the system can take one of these pathways. Persistence corresponds to the system's ability to maintain status quo without changing itself, after the disturbance, which is what the earlier definitions of resilience attributed to. Transition is more of a slow shift to a resilient state while Transformation is much more of a rapid shift. When a system is in a robustly undesirable state, efforts to build resilience might seek to change its structures, purposefully and fundamentally [3 ,15 ]. Adaptability defines the nature of disturbances that the system will face. Specified Resilience is the type of disturbance for which the system is planned to be resilient, which makes it less flexible in nature and vulnerable to unexpected threats. General Resilience is broader and more adaptable in nature, and better in dealing with unforeseen threats [4 ]. Time is an essential factor when it comes to resilience, with the cities, which have a short time to reach a resilient state, being more resilient in nature. Most Research acknowledges the importance of rapid recovery post-disturbance. Temporal emphasis is often contingent on whether the focus is on rapid-onset disasters or more gradual climactic change [16 ].  2.3 Measuring urban resilience – resilience index Being resilient ensures that cities are less vulnerable to disasters and can help improve the quality of life in these cities. While measurement of a complex phenomenon like resilience directly is difficult, by understanding various dimension of the city it is possible to gauge its resilience. Resilience Index is designed to create a resilience baseline and enables cities to measure and monitor the multiple factors that contribute to their resilience. Its primary purpose is to diagnose strengths and weaknesses and measure relative performance over time. Measuring resilience is one of the important processes towards understanding the current and potential future risk of cities to guide the development of suitable policies and strategies related to climate and disaster resilience. Resilience has two qualities: inherent (functions well during non-crisis periods); and adaptive (flexibility in response during disasters) and can be applied to infrastructure, institutions, organizations, social systems, or economic systems [4 ]. 2.3.1 Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) was developed about climate change in Kyoto University. This index utilises 5 Dimensions and their indicators to understand the resilience of an urban area (See Fig. 3 ). CDRI also assess the urban resiliency in nine Asian countries including Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Philippines, India, and Japan . This framework utilises a questionnaire-based approach, with focus on 5 Dimensions - Physical, Social, Economic, Institutional, and Natural, each with 5 indicators each with its set of parameters. In short, by accessing theses different parameters, it can help paint a picture regarding the resilience of the city in consideration. The respondents, the municipalities, are asked to pick a score of 1 to 5, to grade the various parameters of that dimension. Mean Index or Average Weighted Mean Index (AWMI) for each dimension is calculated by using Weighted Mean Index (WMI) method, which is the score for that dimension of the city. The scores obtained are represented graphically in a spider diagram [20 ].   2.4 Urban sustainability and urban resilience Urban Resilience and Urban Sustainability are terms that have been used interchangeably in the past. Cities inherently are considered as complex and resilient systems. As these cities grow, more money is put to the development and expansion of infrastructure. This is projected to about $95 trillion in the coming decade, and the difference between Sustainability and Resilience is essential in ensuring this growth is beneficial to masses [21 ]. Sustainable cities strive to improve resource efficiency, which ignores one of the chief qualities of resilient system, redundancy [1 ,21 ]. They do complement each other; wherein, sustainability represents the normative goal for society while resilience is a non-normative property of a system [7 ]. Fig. 4   shows the Relationship between Sustainability and Resilience while Fig. 5   Shows the interlinkages. While a city can take various ways like Business as Usual which has the least chance of sustainability, to ways which have more high efficiency, balance of both, or more resilience. Fig. 5  also shows resilience as the capacity to strengthen or adhere to a specific pathway, while sustainability is the target [1 ]. Short term efforts on sustainability can bring in undesired resilience, and planning should ensure that desired resilience is harnessed, which can help achieve the goals of sustainability. Also, various scales of resilience must also be considered to ensure Resilience over a larger area [1 ].  2.5 International frameworks highlighting resilience As the impact of climate change has been increasing every year, various international frameworks have been emphasizing on Resilience and Disaster Risk Reduction. 2.5.1 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were born at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. The objective was to produce a set of universal goals that meet the urgent environmental, political, and economic challenges facing our world. Goal 11 aims at making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, by which the international community recognized urbanization and city growth as a transformative force for development [24 ].  2.5.2 The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 was adopted at the Third UN World Conference in Sendai, Japan, on March 18, 2015. The Sendai Framework is the successor instrument to the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005–2015. The Sendai Framework sets four specific priorities for action - Understanding disaster risk, strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk, investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience, enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response, and to “Build Back Better” in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction [25 ].   2.6 Government guidelines The following are the various guidelines by the Government, National and State, that highlights disaster management and resilience in India. 2.6.1 National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) The National Disaster Management Plan was prepared by the National Disaster Management Authority, which oversees disaster management all over India, with the objective to establish mechanisms to help coordinate and eliminate any ambiguity during the various stage of disaster management at all levels of the government, namely from national to local government. This plan stresses on Disaster Preparedness, capacity Building, and Resilience [17 ].  2.6.2 Rebuild Kerala Development Programme Rebuild Kerala Initiative was formulated by the state Government of Kerala, after the floods of 2018, with the intention to build back better and to make the state more resilient. Major aspects of this initiative include focus on sustainable development, inclusivity, and capacity building initiatives, among others, in the state of Kerala [19 ].    3 Master plan & resilience master plan Master Plan and Resilience Master Plan are both long term planning documents that provides a conceptual blueprint for future growth and development. While a traditional Master Plan aims to achieve development in balanced and controlled manner, a Resilience Master Plan aims to make the cities more resilient, while also ensuring sustainable development. A Resilience Master Plan is essential in preparing a large urban area from various effects of climate change, which has increased the intensity of various disasters striking these cities. It reduces impact of these disasters in these urban areas and helps to avoid large sums of expenditure in rebuilding theses cities, while helping achieve the goal of sustainable development. In a Resilience Master Plan, the various aspects of the city are analysed from the point of view of vulnerability.  4 Appraisal - master plan for Kozhikode city 2035 The Master Plan for Kozhikode City 2035 was sanctioned in 2017 by the Government of Kerala for implementation in the city. This plan was formulated by the Regional Town Planning Office, Kozhikode. For the study, Master Plan was appraised with regards to Resilience. This should help understand the efforts for the local stakeholders in ensuring the improvement of the city's Resilience. 4.1 Introduction The Master Plan area includes the present Kozhikode Corporation – Old Kozhikode Corporation, Elathur, Beyore, and Cheruvannur-Nallalom areas, and the surrounding suburban areas of Feroke, Kadalundi, Ramanattukara, and Olavanna (See Fig. 6  ).  4.2 Development vision The thrust of the Master Plan is primarily on the economic and sustainable development with emphasizes on the conservation of heritage values and traditional occupations which have driven the city for centuries.  4.3 Development goals The main attention of the Master Plan is to transform the city of Kozhikode into a Sustainable city with a strong regional significance and a strong economic base, with an emphasis for development of social welfare systems as well as transit services, all while conserving the environmentally sensitive areas of the region. While these initiatives emphasize on in the development of the city as well as the individual sectors, they do not address aspects like robustness, redundancy and flexibility of these sectors while failing to address on other aspects like disasters and their mitigation which are vital in making cities resilient.  4.4 Appraisal of Kozhikode master plan 2035 The projected population of the Master Plan area for 2021 and 2031 are 853,971 and 878,266, respectively, considering natural growth of the population. Considering the state's urban patterns and physiography, and other aspects like migration, the population is expected to grow to 1.3 million [23 ]. Some proposals for the residential aspects include setting up a high-density residential areas in the core to reduce urban sprawl, slum improvement schemes, and creation of fishing village among others. While creating high-density mixed-use cores improves the efficiency of the city, providing housing for the vulnerable will help boost resilience of the people. The proposals to improve roads, walkability, and focus on Mass Rapid Transport will boost the resilience of this sector by increasing the robustness and redundancy of the sector making it more adaptable in nature. The plan proposes to promote reduce-reuse-recycle strategy as well as to create awareness, promote and enforce mandatory decentralized solid waste management and a garbage treatment plant along with sewerage treatment plant with supportive masters plans for the same. While decentralization can help establish a more flexible system, a lack of a centralized plan to combine these two aspects along with no disaster preparedness can lead to the failure of the system. Fisheries and Agriculture and are major Primary Sectors in the city. While there are proposals to improve the quality of these sectors, these proposals fail to express redundant measures for the people in Primary sectors, which are largely dependent on volatile natural factors. The proposals to aid transition of the industries and economic sectors from traditional to modern age while also making it a prominent trading centre, make it reflective and robust in nature. But other issues like redundancies of the industries and flexibility of the market in an event of catastrophe and the lack of integration aren't addressed, making it less resilient. The development concept for tourism sector is to establish World class tourism infrastructure in the planning area. These proposals while enhancing its robustness by improving its infrastructure, fails to address the redundancy and flexible nature of this sector by not bolstering the livelihood aspects by ensuring the masses have an alternative livelihood. The proposals also stress the need to conserve and protect both natural and cultural heritages and integrate them with the various aspects of the city. Various sectors have an integrated goal of sustainable development. The other sectors like those of water supply, social development, education and health amenities, recreational amenities and other recreational amenities primarily focus on making it robust and inclusive, and meeting future needs. While sustainability has been a prime focus of Master Plan for Kozhikode City 2035, the plan fails to consider the impact of past disasters on the various aspects of the city and how to tackle them, especially climate change, which is essential in boosting the resilience of the city.   5 Framework for resilience master plan – Kozhikode This section establishes a framework to reformulate a Resilience Master Plan for Kozhikode city. 5.1 Goal To transform Kozhikode to a resilient city in all aspects, adaptive to recover from disasters of any kind, while ensuring sustainable development with a strong and flexible economic base supported by a robust infrastructure network guided by an inclusive and efficient government and institutions.  5.2 Concept The idea is to formulate a new policy to combine developmental and conventional aspects of Master Plan with resilient nature of that of a Disaster Management plan. This ensures a more efficient manner to manage the growth of the city in a sustainable manner while ensuring that the city is resilient to the various hazards that it is prone to.  5.3 Guiding principles The framework is to follow the following Principles and Guidelines to as to meet the goals. These are - National Disaster Management Plan 2019, Rebuild Kerala Development Programme, Master Plan for Kozhikode Urban Area 2035, Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI), Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and Sustainable Development Goals.  5.4 Structure To reformulate the Resilience Master Plan for Kozhikode city, the first step is to understand the present scenario of the city with regards to resilience, then establish a baseline resilience for the city through analysis, and then create a resilience master plan for Kozhikode.   6 Resilience study of Kozhikode city This purpose of this study is to understand the present scenario of the various aspects of the city with regards to resilience. The city is located mostly in the coastal and midlands region of the state, with the Arabian sea on the west and highest points located in the east (See Fig. 7 ). The Lagoons and backwaters around the city, receives the drainage from rivers and tidal waters. The soil in the city is ideal for cultivation of spices and coconut [23 ].  The city also has tropical monsoon climate with a hot and a wet season, with the wettest season between June and September. The average Rainfall is 3266 mm and average temperature around 28C.The city is also home to many rivers like Chaliyar river, Kallayi river, Kora River, Poonoor river and Iravanjhi river, and Canolly Canal. Kottoli Urban Wetlands spread over 200 acres, is in the heart of the city [10 ]. 6.1 Disaster profile of Kozhikode The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) of Kozhikode, which oversees disaster management for the district of Kozhikode, identifies the 4 types of disasters that are plausible in the district - Naturally triggered/Weather related, Geological, Biological, Anthropogenically/Technologically triggered. The tables below shows a snapshot of the various disasters that struck the district between 2010 and 2014 [13 ]. (Refer Table 1  ). The city of Kozhikode is prone to disasters like Flooding, Drought, Storm Surge, Lightening, Epidemics, Coastal Erosion, among others (Refer Table 2  ).  6.2 Physical aspects The existing land use of an area gives the spatial representation of the activities of an area. Commercial land uses are concentrated in the city core while industrial uses are in the Periphery. The major land use is Residential in nature, with 67.63% and Water and dry agriculture following it with 6.5% and 6.4%, respectively [23 ]. The highly dense core area of the city along the coast is vulnerable to disasters like flooding and epidemics, and this is an important regional commercial centre. The city is a major transit hub of the state, and well accessible by all methods. About 457,585 vehicles were registered until 2019. (Primary Survey - Regional Transportation Office, March 2020) About 4% of fatal and grievous accidents in the state happens in the city [11 ]. About 103kms of road and a bridge were damaged in floods of 2018 [10 ]. While the city is robust with regards to connectivity, the lack of alternative like Mass Transit Systems and good water ways limits redundancy. The limited road geometry is stressed by increase in vehicles. Rivers Chaliyar and Punoorpuzha are the major sources of surface water. The city also relies on ground water as well, using shallow tube wells and open wells. The city has 4 treatment plants with a total capacity of 144MLD, and a storage capacity of 10.8ML. Many wells of the city are bacteriologically polluted and have faecal contamination [23 ]. The supply system is not robust, and city lacks an integrated and an alternative supply system. There is a need to enhance the system by countering contamination. The storm water drains are drained into the rivers and sea through canals like Canolly canal, which have shrunk due to rapid urbanization. The city also lacks a centralized sewage system and are dependent on methods like septic tanks. Solid waste collection is sparse and limited. The lack of effective storm water drains and collection leads to flooding. The improper waste collection and disposal further exacerbates pollution leads to decline of public health. The city is only reliant on conventional power sources like thermal sources, with primary use being domestic purpose [23 ]. The electricity supply despite being 100% available to all, is not efficient and stable enough. The supply network is also prone to disaster related failures. The lack of alternative energy sources reduces the resilience of the city. The estimated damages in the district to the infrastructure sector was about Rs.111 million due to the floods of 2018 [10 ]. The city is the regional hub of social infrastructure, with renowned educational and health institutions in and around the city, both government and private. The city is also home to several recreational facilities like Mananchira Square. While Educational and Recreational amenities are distributed well, they must be more robust in quality. While the health facilities are world class, the recent epidemics have stressed the need for capacity building exercises.  6.3 Social aspects Kozhikode City is the third most populous city in Kerala, behind the cities of Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi. The city has a population of 608,255 with 131,145 household, and a household size of 4.55. The growth rate of the city is around 1.05% with sex ratio of 1093. The literacy rate of the city is 96.53%. The net density is 5312 Persons/Sqkm while the gross density is 5120 Persons/Sqkm, with most of the density being concentrated in the core of the city towards the coast. Most of the city's population, about 97.76%, are employed in secondary and tertiary industries, with cultivators and agricultural labourers accounting just 1% of the work force. The female work participation rate of the city is just 11.48% [6 ]. During the floods of 2018, about 34 people died, mostly due to landslide, in the district. With declining growth rate, due to migration, and aging population, there is a need for integrated solutions to fix this. The reflective nature of the city has enabled it to transition its workforce to modern one, while not being robust in nature. Housing in the city is extremely robust. The damages to the household due the floods were about Rs.60 million in the district [10 ]. The city is adapting to suit the changing needs. There is a need to improve the quality of living in the city generally by improving sanitations and the surroundings, with some vulnerable communities living along the coast. The city has about 38% poverty, along with significant minority communities, and an aging population. The city lacks the necessary infrastructure to support the special groups like Persons with Disability. By boosting the infrastructure for these minority communities, the resilience is further increased.  6.4 Economic aspects There has been a shift in industries from traditional to new age industries, with the transition just beginning. The city has commercial areas of regional importance like SM Street located in the core. Beypore Port, a historic port, has a significant role in the marine products industry of the region. Tourism is another important industry, with the city having some important spots like Kozhikode and Kappad beach in proximity and acting as a transit point for scenic places like Wayanad. Agriculture with its high production cost and low price is in decline in the area, which has significant homestead cultivation. It is a similar scenario with the fisheries sector which is in decline [23 ]. The agriculture sector faced a loss of about Rs. 31,937,220 in the floods of 2018, with losses of about 250 livestock. Fisheries lost about 8 boats and 9 aquaculture farms in the same [10 ]. Tourism too was significantly affected in the floods. With the Commercial and industrial activities robust but concentrated in some areas they are highly vulnerable. Another primary issue is the lack of alternative occupation for the Primary sector, which are weather dependent.  6.5 Institutional aspects The city had an allocated budget of about Rs. 4 billion in 2016–2017 [14 ] and the district faced damages of about Rs. 1.6 billion in the floods of 2018 [10 ]. While the governance has been successful to tackle recent disasters, increasing the city's resilience will lower the expenditure to rebuild. Kozhikode DDMA headed by the District Collector, formulates the District Disaster Management Plan (DDMP), which helps in identifying various vulnerabilities and threats and methods to tackle them at the district level, and not at a city level. A city level plan with details like graphical representation at a community level will help in making the city more resilient and adept at dealing with disasters. There is also lack of climate change adaptation policies.  6.6 Natural aspects About 22kms of coastline lies within the city and has various ecological sensitive areas like wetlands and backwaters. The city has various cultural and heritage sites as well. Both are threatened with the rising urbanization. Wetlands have been reclaimed for this purpose. Local laws need to be enforced to help conserve these elements, which can help boost the resilience by reducing the impact of disasters and by creating strong social bonds through the conservation of the heritage sites.   7 Resilience analysis of Kozhikode city Based on the study, the resilience of the City of Kozhikode is assimilated below. 7.1 Resilience index for Kozhikode City In this analysis, using the CDRI framework's Dimensions, Indicators and Sub indicators, the Resilience of Kozhikode city is measured based on the interviews and surveys with the experts and stakeholders who manage the city. CDRI is selected as it has been found to be suitable for Indian coastal cities. The methodology of the study involved taking a survey of managerial people various the city, by asking them to rate various dimensions and their indicators of the city. The score for each dimension is derived using the Average Weighted Mean Index (AWMI) method, whose average will give us the final Resilience Index Score for the city. The scores helps to establish how resilient the city is, and the areas which needs to focused to help improve the city's resilience. The Fig. 8  below shows the final scores for the various dimensions.   7.2 Quality of resilience analysis The qualities of the aspects of the city are compared with that of the intrinsic makings that define a resilient system. This helps in understanding how various sectors meet the qualities of resilience (Refer Table 3  ).  7.3 SWOC analysis In this analysis the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Challenges with regards to the resilience of Kozhikode City are considered (See Fig. 9  ).  7.4 Vulnerability map The map (See Fig. 10 ) combines the Population Density, the vulnerable areas, and the topography of the city. The flood and coastal erosion vulnerability indicated is based on Flood Susceptibility Zones by Kerala State Disaster Management Authority and National Centre for Earth Science Studies.    8 Resilience master plan for Kozhikode city These are the proposals that have been suggested to improve the resilience of the city. 8.1 Vision A sustainable, resilient, and liveable city, with the robust infrastructure driven forward by a flexible economy and led by an inclusive and efficient governance system prepared to face hazards of any nature.  8.2 Mission The primary aim is to create a city resilient in nature which achieves the development goals in a sustainable manner, motivated by flexible and adaptive economy and supported by a strong and robust economy while creating a system of governance that is inclusive and efficient in nature.  8.3 Concept The proposals of the Resilient Master Plan include two main divisions, namely Disaster Resilience Plan and Building Resilience.  8.4 Disaster resilience plan This plan categorises each of the administrative wards of the city into High, Moderate, and Low vulnerability zones, identifies the relief and medical centres, and the evacuation routes to these centres and away from the city in the aftermath of a disaster.  8.5 Building resilience This part of the proposal deals with improving the resilience in other aspects of the city.  8.6 Financing and scope Funds necessary for implementing the various proposals will be raised from multiple sources like State Budget with assistance from multilateral agencies, Central government natural disaster assistance, Crowdfunding, State institutions like KIIFB, HUDCO and other loans. These proposed proposals will run in tandem with those that are proposed in the Master Plan of Kozhikode 2035.  8.7 Disaster resilience plan This aspect of the proposals aims to identify the most and least vulnerable areas of the city and improve its disaster preparedness. Fig. 11   above combines the three aspects of this plan - Vulnerability Zone Map, Disaster Relief Centres, Disaster Evacuation Routes. The Vulnerability Zone Map divides the city into different zones, namely High, Moderate, and Low Vulnerability Zones, based on population density and Disaster vulnerability. The disaster relief camp shows the various disaster relief and medical centres identified, while the Evacuation routes show the main routes of evacuation from the city and to the nearest relief camps. Based on the nature of vulnerability, a detailed plan is to be developed for all the administrative wards to make them resilient.  8.8 Building resilience Building Resilience aims to help improve the resilience of the city by focusing on the various aspects of the city. Fig. 12   shows the various proposals, in addition to the ones that are already proposed in Master Plan for Kozhikode City 2035, that are essential to boost the resilience of the city. These proposals are divided into 4 primary aspects to meet a specific objective. Robust Infrastructure network to ensure that they can withstand the effects of ever worsening climate change, Flexible Economy to help ensure that the people have a sustained livelihood despite the occurrence of various catastrophes, Inclusivity & Governance to help improve and ensure social cohesion and efficiency, and Sustainability to reduce the impact of development on the surrounding environment.   9 Conclusion Understanding Resilience is an effective mechanism to ensure that cities can achieve the goal of sustainability while also combating the various vulnerabilities and challenges it will face along the way. Resilience is the means to strengthen the possibility of achieving sustainable development, with the Resilience Master Plan serving as the means to systematically achieve that. While the Master Plan of Kozhikode 2035 addresses various issues with regards to sustainability, the Master Plan fails to acknowledge the disasters which have struck the city or the impact they have had on the various facets of the city, or on how to deal with them. The rising threat of various disasters like Floods, Coastal Erosion, and Epidemics, with the severity of these increasing in recent times, have necessitated for such a plan. Thus, by increasing the resilience of the city by implementing these proposals, Kozhikode city can boost its resilience and actualize the goal of development in a sustainable manner in the long term.
