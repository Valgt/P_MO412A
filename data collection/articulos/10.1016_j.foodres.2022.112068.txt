                  In recent years, the rapid increase in the global population, the challenges associated with climate change, and the emergence of new pandemics have all become major threats to food security worldwide. Consequently, innovative solutions are urgently needed to address the current challenges and enhance food sustainability. Green technologies have gained significant attention for many food applications, while the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) are reshaping different production and consumption sectors, such as food and agriculture. In this review, a general overview of green and Industry 4.0 technologies from a food perspective will be provided. Connections between green food technologies (e.g., green preservation, processing, extraction, and analysis) and Industry 4.0 enablers (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet of Things) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be identified and explained. Green and Industry 4.0 technologies are both rapidly becoming a valuable part of meeting the SDGs. These technologies demonstrate high potential to foster ecological and digital transitions of food systems, delivering societal, economic, and environmental outcomes. A range of green technologies has already provided innovative solutions for major food system transformations, while the application of digital technologies and other Industry 4.0 technological innovations is still limited in the food sector. It is therefore expected that more green and digital solutions will be adopted in the coming years, harnessing their full potential to achieve a healthier, smarter, more sustainable and more resilient food future.

Graphical abstract       In recent years, the rapid increase in the global population, the challenges associated with climate change, and the emergence of new pandemics have all become major threats to food security worldwide. Consequently, innovative solutions are urgently needed to address the current challenges and enhance food sustainability. Green technologies have gained significant attention for many food applications, while the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) are reshaping different production and consumption sectors, such as food and agriculture. In this review, a general overview of green and Industry 4.0 technologies from a food perspective will be provided. Connections between green food technologies (e.g., green preservation, processing, extraction, and analysis) and Industry 4.0 enablers (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet of Things) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be identified and explained. Green and Industry 4.0 technologies are both rapidly becoming a valuable part of meeting the SDGs. These technologies demonstrate high potential to foster ecological and digital transitions of food systems, delivering societal, economic, and environmental outcomes. A range of green technologies has already provided innovative solutions for major food system transformations, while the application of digital technologies and other Industry 4.0 technological innovations is still limited in the food sector. It is therefore expected that more green and digital solutions will be adopted in the coming years, harnessing their full potential to achieve a healthier, smarter, more sustainable and more resilient food future.

Rapid population growth also poses a serious challenge about the need to increase food production without compromising the environment, food quality, and human health (Fasolin et al., 2019; Garcia-oliveira et al., 2022 ). Current food systems are unsustainable and contribute significantly to climate change in addition to generating huge amounts of waste (Caldeira et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022 ). Thus, a shift towards greater food sustainability is urgently needed to contribute to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs were introduced by the United Nations in 2015 with the expectation of being attained by 2030. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted efforts to meet that timetable (Bisoffi et al., 2021; Hamed et al., 2022 ). Therefore, innovative solutions and major transformations are immediately required to ensure adequate sustenance needs of present and future generations (García-Oliveira et al., 2022 ). At least 11 of the 17 SDGs established in 2015 by the United Nations (UN) are deeply intertwined with the food system and call for a redefinition of both its structure and governance to achieve or, more realistically, approach at least the first two SDGs: “No poverty” and “Zero hunger”. There are strong links between SDGs and manufacturing practices in agriculture and the food industry. For example, green food processing (such as emerging extraction techniques) can be used to valorise agricultural by-products and other bio-residuals to recover valuable compounds without using chemical solvents or reagents (Fig. 1  ). The extracted edible ingredients (e.g., oils and proteins) can then be used in the food, cosmetics, and biofuels (Picart-Palmade et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2022 ). Many studies have shown that the fourth industrial revolution (also called Industry 4.0) has the potential to provide innovative approaches to address global challenges, such as food traceability (Hassoun, Abdullah, et al., 2022 ) and food quality (Hassoun et al., 2023 ). There is currently no universally accepted definition of Industry 4.0 (Ali et al., 2021; Romanello & Veglio, 2022 ). However, in the agri-food sector, Industry 4.0 encompasses digital innovations and other advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), 3D printing, blockchain, smart sensors, robotics, cloud computing, and digital twins (Hassoun, Aït-kaddour, et al., 2022 ; Hassoun, Harastani, et al., 2022 ; Hassoun, Siddiqui, et al., 2022 ; Hassoun et al., 2023 ). Several reviews have recently been published with a focus on the significant relationship between Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainable development. For example, the role of Industry 4.0 technologies in enabling lean manufacturing practices and sustainable organizational performance was investigated by Kamble et al. (2020) . The impact of digital technologies on the achievement of the SDGs was studied through a cross-case analysis of companies that are active in the Italian agri-food sector (Secundo et al., 2022 ). García-Oliveira and co-authors highlighted many problems that are impacting the achievement of the green revolution and sustainable food systems, and they suggested solutions based on innovative technologies to alleviate these challenges (Garcia-oliveira et al., 2022; García-Oliveira et al., 2022 ). The connection between agri-food 4.0 and sustainability has been highlighted with regard to the role of big data in improving the valorisation of agricultural wastes and by-products (Belaud et al., 2019 ). Recent advances in the field of IoT applications for achieving sustainability in the agricultural sector were also recently reviewed (Maroli et al., 2021 ). Beier et al. (2021)  argued that sustainability aspects must be an integral part of Industry 4.0 implementation in order to support sustainable development. However, thus far, no review has comprehensively examined the impact of green technologies and Industry 4.0 innovations in the food and agriculture sectors. Therefore, the objective of this manuscript is to explore the role of Industry 4.0 and green technologies in accelerating the global transition towards sustainable food systems.  2 Methodology This review evaluated peer-reviewed publications, grey literature, relevant networking websites and conference proceedings regarding the application of green technologies and Industry 4.0 enablers in the context of food sustainability. The objective was to highlight the potential of these advanced technologies as key elements for more sustainable food systems. The following search criteria were applied to the Scopus databases: Search 1. TITLE-ABS-KEY (Fourth industrial revolution) OR (Industry 4.0) AND (Sustainable food) OR (Food sustainability). Search 2. TITLE-ABS-KEY (Green technologies) AND (Sustainable food) OR (Food sustainability). According to data obtained using the Scopus dataset (Fig. 2  ), the number of publications and citations on the use of Industry 4.0 in the context of sustainable food or food sustainability has increased significantly over the last decade, especially in the last two years. Among the different Industry 4.0 technologies, the application of blockchain to ensure food safety, increase food traceability, and prevent fraud has been highlighted in various publications (Friedman & Ormiston, 2022; Ren et al., 2022 ). The use of IoT to maintain safety standards, limit food waste, manage unpredictable variations, and track and monitor the quality of products in the food industry has been reported (Bigliardi et al., 2022 ). The disruptive contribution of big data, AI, and IoT in shaping the future of agri-food systems was highlighted in a recent comprehensive overview (Misra et al., 2022 ). Another overview illustrated the multiple opportunities offered by 3D food printing to increase food supply chain sustainability (Baiano, 2020 ).  3 Sustainable development Goals from food system perspectives The circular bioeconomy approach should be promoted along with making more efforts to find the right balance between environmental sustainability and socio-economic sustainability, and between the exploitation of natural resources and food systems, to achieve most of the UN goals by 2030. Moreover, it will be impossible to feed more than 8.5 billion people while safeguarding natural resources and the planet (Willett et al., 2019 ) if, for example, food waste is not reduced (about 1/3 of the food produced is lost or wasted) and its impact on climate and biodiversity is not diminished. Moreover, if developed countries do not promote a circular economy as a driving force for a fair, responsible and sustainable use of natural resources, it will be very difficult to ensure equity, rights and healthy food for all in the coming decades (Fanzo et al., 2021 ). Otherwise, there is the danger that the current problems, especially food inequality, would be aggravated rather than solved. In light of the considerations above, we have used 20 select scientific papers and relevant grey literature to gain insight into what can be improved in the complex maze of the “food system” (in which people, natural resources, customs and habits, environment, culture and the economy, etc., interact) so as to meet, at least in part, some of the UN SDGs. In this regard, Fig. 3   provides an overview of the main keywords (forming 3 clusters) resulting from a Scopus search for “Sustainable Development Goals” and “Food System”. In this section, we will discuss various issues and challenges for the terrestrial food system and the role of the seafood sector in meeting the UN SDGs. Even though land-based animal-sourced foods (i.e., red and white meat, dairy products, eggs and other secondary meat products) are widely reputed to have negative effects on human health, it is estimated that the average demand for these foods in the next 30 years will increase from 1.4 to 2.0 billion tonnes (Henchion et al., 2021 ). This increase would be unsustainable and in absolute contrast with SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 6 (Clean water and sanitation), 12 (Responsible consumption and production), 13 (Climate action) and 15 (Life on land). Moreover, the 2019 EAT-Lancet report called on all countries, especially those with a high average consumption of animal-sourced products, to reverse course and promote the consumption of plant-based foods (Willett et al., 2019 ). The increase in plant-based foods must take into consideration the protection of biodiversity of the biological value of thousands of edible plant species and varieties that are at risk of extinction, and must not simply involve an unlimited increase in the production of the few higher-yielding varieties. Furthermore, it must also be attentive to soil microbiota, insects and vertebrates, which are an enormous biodiversity asset and play an important regulatory role in the Earth and food system and cannot be overlooked when safeguarding terrestrial biomes (Willett et al., 2019 ). Given these caveats and recommendations, countries across all continents are promoting nationwide food-based dietary guidelines to move toward more sustainable and healthy plant-based diets. These guidelines call for specific measures to reduce red meat and dairy product consumption, thereby reducing the intensive farming of animals. They also raise the issue of greenhouse gases (GHGs), in particular methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide, of which 21–37 % comes from the food system supply chain, including crop and livestock production and food processing (Clark et al., 2020; Fanzo et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, about 8 % of these emissions have been attributed to food loss and waste, which amount to about 1.3 billion tons per year according to the latest available estimates (Read et al., 2020 ). Other ways to disincentivize the intensive consumption of terrestrial animal-sourced foods in developed countries include implementing special food education campaigns to encourage healthy, sustainable diets or increasing the price of animal-sourced foods to reduce the demand on these products (Springmann et al., 2017 ). At the same time, more applied research is needed in the field of food packaging, particularly to incentivize all players in the food supply chain (from producer to consumer) to use biopolymer-based materials rather than long-lasting synthetic plastic containers. Despite all indicators showing a reduction in fish stocks due to overfishing (Pauly & Zeller, 2017 ), the latest estimates indicate that global marine fishery catches range between 80 and 100 million tons/year, including about 10 million tons of discarded species. The largest share of these aquatic resources is destined for human consumption and is now the primary source of animal protein for over 3 billion people, providing micronutrients for the poorest (FAO, 2020 ). Some 10 million tons of fish and shellfish that are discarded in the sea each year (about 40 % from trawl fisheries) due to their low commercial value (FAO, 2020; Sampantamit et al., 2020 ) could contribute significantly to the achievement of at least 4 of the SDGs (“No Poverty”, “Zero hunger”, “Life below water” and “Responsible consumption and production”). For example, this huge irresponsibly discarded biomass could be used in the production of nutritious biomolecules (omega-3: EPA, DHA; micronutrients, proteins and other bioactive compounds) for formulating low-cost, high energy Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) to combat adolescent malnutrition (Varghese & Srivastav, 2022 ). In addition, following the principles of a circular economy referred to earlier, what remains after the extraction of high health biomolecules for RUTF could be employed usefully in the production cycle of new sustainable packaging biomaterials (Hassoun, Siddiqui, et al., 2022 ) or for pharmaceutical, medicinal, environmental, agricultural and biotechnology applications (Singh et al., 2022 ). It is also important to note that an increased consumption of seafood products, particularly low-trophic aquatic foods, such as small pelagic fish, shellfish, seaweeds, jellyfish, etc., would lower the environmental impact of the production of terrestrial animal-source foods (Hilborn et al., 2018 ). In this regard, some low-trophic aquatic products, such as seaweed represent an important source of primary livelihood in low-income countries and are an excellent source of fiber and micronutrients, besides being the only non-animal source of vitamin B12 (FAO, 2018 ). Lastly, seaweed is just as important for its capacity to sequester carbon and fertilizers, thus improving water quality and contributing to ocean restoration, as well as providing raw materials to produce biodegradable packaging materials as an alternative to plastics (Ahern et al., 2021; FAO, 2018, 2020; Morais et al., 2020 ). In recent years, aquaculture has developed rapidly due to the growing demand for aquatic foods and the decrease in wild catch resources. It has increased from an average annual production of 60 million tons in the period 2006–2015 to over 82 million tons in 2018 (FAO, 2020 ), and this trend is growing continuously. Aquaculture is an excellent way to compensate for a deficit in animal protein and micronutrients, especially in countries where these are lacking (SDGs 1, 2 and 3), but this production activity is also associated with a wide range of environmental drawbacks that contradict the SDGs 6, 12, 13 and 14. Among these drawbacks, Ahmed et al. (2019)  pointed out, the intensive use of land and freshwater resources, as in the case of rice fields and mangroves transformed respectively into fish and shrimp farms, which are therefore subtracted from agricultural activity and the environment. To this list of drawbacks the authors also added the high use of hormones, antibiotics and fertilizers, biotic depletion (especially of the wild population), the explosion of parasites, and the increase in GHG emissions. In light of the above considerations, and without prejudice to the fundamental role of aquaculture as a source of animal proteins, investing in integrated agriculture-farming, such as “rice with fish” or “mangrove with shrimps” (Ahmed et al., 2019; Thilsted et al., 2016 ), investing in the farming of non-fed seafood products, such as bivalves, seaweed and sea cucumbers or in aquaponics, can mitigate the impact of fed aquaculture species on the environment and help progress towards a more sustainable food systems in the near future.  4 Overview of the Industry 4.0 technologies Industry 4.0 is rapidly changing several industrial sectors and providing food supply chains with more powerful computing networks, due to the massive arrival of new generations of AI, IoT, big data analytics, blockchain technology, robotics, and the latest acceleration in the communication technologies, such as the 5G (Alcácer & Cruz-Machado, 2019; Liu et al., 2021 ). Sensors, machines, systems, animals, crops, devices, factories, farms, and people inside these chains are constantly generating data that can be used to boost sustainable development (Marvin et al., 2022; Ramirez-Asis et al., 2022 ). 4.1 Artificial intelligence Understanding the complexity of the food system, including the interrelationships with other domains such as economy, environment and society is key to the development of methodologies needed in order to achieve a more sustainable food system, producing sufficient, safe and healthy foods. Given the complexity of the current food supply chain, a systems approach is essential, to take into account all factors having a direct and/ or indirect impact on every stage of the food supply chain. Examples demonstrating how such a systems approach can be implemented using AI have recently been shown for food safety and food fraud (Bouzembrak et al., 2019; Marvin et al., 2016, 2020; Marvin & Bouzembrak, 2020 ). In these studies, expert elicitation in combination with Bayesian Networks showed superior results giving models with high prediction accuracy (often > 90 %). In regard to transparency and traceability along the food supply chain, AI aids in keeping a watch on the entire food supply chain in production process optimization, inventory management, price prediction, costs estimation, and logistics management (Camaréna, 2020; Hebbar, 2020 ). AI integrates data collected from several data sources, such as cameras, sensors, and internet connectivity to add value to the production system. It supports in the delivery of food through smart logistics such as the tracking of crops and vegetables, which reduces the vegetable waste (Meshram et al., 2021; Sharma et al., 2021 ). AI saves time and increases efficiency and accuracy of several tasks (especially repetitive tasks) in the manufacturing and agricultural industries. For example, AI-based apps can determine which potatoes are best suited for chips and which are better suited for French fries with high accuracy and precision (Misra et al., 2022; Ramirez-Asis et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, recently it was argued that AI could help solve more complex problems in livestock farming (Fuentes et al., 2022 ) and the food industry (Kler et al., 2022 ).  4.2 Big data technology Sensors, intelligent machines, cameras, and actors operating along the food supply chain are constantly producing data. With growing computer power and advances in computer technologies, this data could be processed faster, more thoroughly, and more in-depth than ever before. However, handling the big data generated along the food supply chain is still challenging and time-consuming, and requires a large computational infrastructure. Although cloud computing technologies have been emerged as a solution in other sectors, their use in the food chain remains in its infancy (Jin et al., 2020; Rejeb et al., 2022 ). In the food chain, several research challenges, such as scalability, availability, data integrity, data transformation, data governance, privacy and legal issues have not yet been fully addressed. Cloud computing technology might accelerate the implementation of the “lab to sample approach” in which food safety data is generated on-site (e.g., portable devices and sensors), transferred to a central cloud-based data e-infrastructure, processed and analyzed online. The results are directly sent back to the operator allowing on-site decisions on compliance with food safety legislation. This approach will reduce the costs and enhance the efficiency of food safety control since only suspected samples will be taken to the laboratory, where they will be analyzed by highly skilled laboratory personnel employing sophisticated equipment. In case IoT can be applied, a potential food safety risk will be detected early allowing quick actions to mitigate the risks (Jin et al., 2020; Kler et al., 2022; Marvin et al., 2022 ).  4.3 Internet of things & smart sensors The food supply chain could be considered as an ideal candidate for the deployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled. IoT provides a wealth of solutions to gather data from any stage of the food supply chain using sophisticated sensors and devices such as temperature, quality, machine maintenance, sales, orders, and information on transportation, storage, and environment in real-time during the whole lifecycle of the food product (Bouzembrak et al., 2019; Marvin et al., 2022 ). The application of IoT in the food sector enables numerous traceability opportunities, such as tracking the location of products, production, and delivery schedules, ingredient sources, handling, and usage history. IoT sensors also allow tracking of temperatures at critical food safety points within cold food supply chains. The potential of several spectroscopic techniques operating in the ultraviolet, visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR) or mid-infrared (MIR) regions has been widely investigated, with the VIS-NIR regions being the most used analysis for food products. Currently, some of these techniques are moving from the lab to application fields, and even to consumers due to the rapid development of to smartphone applications, to manage different issues, such as determination of chemical composition, colour, and other physical properties, microplastic detection, microbial spoilage, authenticity issues, as well as process monitoring (Chen et al., 2021; Neeba et al., 2021 ). Moreover, smart sensors based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) have received enormous interests in the food sector for its properties to generate automatically, rapidly, and in one shot spatial and spectral information without the need for solvents or highly trained staff. Therefore, HSI can be considered as a promising building block for the Industry 4.0 (Echegaray et al., 2022 ; Hassoun, Aït-kaddour, et al., 2022 ).  4.4 Internet of things & blockchain Blockchain is one of the Industry 4.0 components that is closely related to the concepts of sustainability and traceability. Blockchain technology is often used in combination with IoT to guarantee the traceability of products throughout the supply chain. This makes it possible to monitor the preservation of the organoleptic properties of food throughout the whole process 'from Farm-to-Fork', ensuring food safety. Bai et al. (2020)  reported that blockchain is the most economically sustainable Industry 4.0 technology, and could, along with the other Industry 4.0 elements, dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. Traceability meets the sustainability requirements of the agriculture and food sector which is currently strongly characterized by food waste. Food waste has become among the trendy topics in recent years, both in industry and scientific research community. Reducing food waste guarantees the fulfilment of a triple objective of sustainability - environmental, economic, and social – hence the special attention given to food waste recovery pathways using blockchain (Bigliardi et al., 2022; Tsolakis et al., 2021 ). In addition to ensuring traceability and reducing food waste, blockchain has significant potential in many other applications, such as increasing consumer awareness to make better informed purchasing decisions and achieving fair pricing through the whole value chain (Kamilaris et al., 2019 ).  4.5 Robotics & smart machines Automation and use of robots are among the main features of the Industry 4.0 paradigm. Agricultural automation and robotics refer to the process of applying robots, automatic control, and AI techniques at all levels of agricultural production. Likewise, advanced automation solutions and autonomous robots are being developed in smart factories in the food industry (Liu et al., 2022; Marvin et al., 2022; Ramirez-Asis et al., 2022 ). Smart machines can complete several tasks in agriculture, such as cultivation, sowing, transplanting, fertilization, spraying, feeding, irrigation, picking, and harvesting. In addition, intelligent machinery can collect information on soil, water quality, crops, and aquatic products, providing technical support for the implementation of precision agriculture (Xu et al., 2022 ). Many operations in food manufacturing industry and post-harvest supply chains (such as quality control and sorting, picking and packing, shipping, and distributing) can be automated using various types of robots (Bader & Rahimifard, 2020; Chauhan et al., 2022 ).  4.6 Digital twins All of the technologies mentioned above have increased the potential of digital twins, which are virtual models based on simulation and can be used to understand the performance parameters, ameliorate processes, improve value-added activities, and enhance sustainable manufacturing operations (Kamble et al., 2022 ). Digital twins can improve productivity and sustainability in smart farming (Verdouw et al., 2021 ), tailor supply chains, and predict postharvest food quality to maximize shelf life and reduce food losses (Defraeye et al., 2021 ). Digital twins can provide many other advantages, such as lesser incidences of inter-product variability, reduced use of resources, energy savings, optimized production planning, improved logistics, and higher transparency, among others. However, the use of digital twins is still limited due to the need for a multidisciplinary approach and specific modelling and programming (Verboven et al., 2020 ).   5 Connections between Industry 4.0 technologies and the sustainable development goals Recent research shows that Industry 4.0 technological innovations could contribute significantly towards promoting food sustainability and enabling more sustainable food production and consumption patterns (Bai et al., 2020 ; Hassoun, Bekhit, et al., 2022 ). Industry 4.0 technologies have the potential to accelerate the integration of smart technologies in food manufacturing (smart factories) and in agriculture and production systems (smart/precision agriculture and farming). Many recent publications have highlighted the significant role of Industry 4.0 innovations in reducing and valorising food waste (Jagadiswaran et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021 ), enhancing food quality (Hassoun et al., 2023 ), improving food traceability (Hassoun, Abdullah, et al., 2022 ), and participating in the development of healthier and more sustainable food products (Hassoun, Harastani, et al., 2022 ). The main Industry 4.0 technologies used to achieve smart food factories and farming, to enhance food quality, safety, and traceability, to reduce food waste and energy consumption, and to develop new and healthier foods are shown in Fig. 4  . 5.1 Role of Industry 4.0 technologies in smart food factories and smart farming systems The most significant embodiment of Industry 4.0 in the food industry is smart factories, while the adaption of digital and other advanced technologies for applications in agriculture and livestock has lead to the emergence of precision agriculture and smart farming concepts. Smart factories and smart farming are characterized by a high level of automation and digitalization and they are strongly linked to the use of AI, cloud computing, IoT, robots, and smart sensors (Echegaray et al., 2022; Kumar et al., 2021; Oliveira et al., 2021 ). In smart farming, Industry 4.0 technologies, such as blockchain and big data, can improve the efficiency of water and other inputs, increase yields, and decrease environmental costs, thus enhance sustainability and resilience across both plant cultivation and animal production on farms (Musa & Basir, 2021 ). The use of IoT-equipped and AI-enabled next generation smart agriculture can be efficient in predicting agricultural performance based on present and past conditions, achieving many benefits, such as minimized crop diseases and pest infestation (Kittichotsatsawat et al., 2021; Qazi et al., 2022 ). Recently, it was reported that a better control of agricultural practices can be achieved by integrating advanced technologies (especially blockchain, big data, IoT, Information and Communication Technology, Cloud Computing, and Cyber-Physical System) in the context of smart farming (Surendra Yadav et al., 2022 ). Another recent publication showed that the application of such advanced technologies in smart farming could enhance sustainability and enable more effective farm methods (Javaid et al., 2022 ). Precision livestock farming monitors animals and their environment using remote sensing, computer vision, AI, and other digital technologies to maintain productivity and profitability, improve animal health, and decrease the environmental footprint (Bao & Xie, 2022; Fuentes et al., 2022 ). Smart factories involve the use of complex and precise technologies to improve performance, quality, controllability, management, and transparency of manufacturing processes, and to decrease downtime, waste, defect, and risk across production processes (Ghobakhloo, 2020; Shi et al., 2020 ). AI, big data, IoT, smart sensors, and robots are significant enablers of smart factories, leading to greater flexibility, sustainable manufacturing processes and optimization of food supply chains, food logistics, delivery, and food safety (Ramirez-Asis et al., 2022 ). For example, advanced robots and drones are nowadays equipped with smart sensors and can cooperate with humans to perform many tasks in the production field, such as crop production (such as seeding, planting, weeding, picking, handling, and harvesting) or during the later stage of the food manufacturing chain, e.g., packaging, cutting, slicing, and packaging (Botta et al., 2022; Hesti et al., 2021 ).  5.2 Potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to decrease food waste and energy consumption Several Industry 4.0 technologies can contribute to reducing food waste and energy consumption, and improve resources management. IoT and digital twins can contribute to addressing the problem of food waste (Onwude et al., 2020 ). For example, an automated real-time system based on IoT to monitor the amount and determine the cause of potato waste within potato supply chains was developed (Jagtap et al., 2019 ). The system used image processing and load cell technologies to successfully measure food waste leading to a better under-standing of the main causes of waste generation. In a recent study, the use of IoT in smart farming of black soldier fly was investigated to mitigate food waste (Cheng et al., 2022 ). The results showed that the implementation of sensors/devices, software, and mobile application could help to monitor this farming remotely. IoT can also help to optimize the resource efficiency of food manufacturing, such as energy and water, providing a high level of visibility, transparency, awareness, flexibility and the ability to collect and process a large amount of data in real-time (Jagtap, Garcia-Garcia, et al., 2021 ; Jagtap & Rahimifard, 2019 ). Blockchain has the potential to prevent food waste, encouraging consumers to calculate the ecological footprint of their food and redistributing the surplus (Kayikci et al., 2022 ). 3D printing is another promising Industry 4.0 element that could provide innovative alternatives to valorise a variety of food waste and by-products, such as grape pomace and broken wheat (Jagadiswaran et al., 2021 ).  5.3 Potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to enhance food quality and traceability, and prevent food fraud Optimization of food quality can reduce food waste and foster food sustainability. A wide range of analytical methods and smart technologies has recently emerged in the era of Industry 4.0, having a significant role to play in sustainable social, environmental, and economic development. These emerging technologies have accelerated digitalization and automation in agriculture and the food industry, enabling rapid, online and in-site monitoring and intelligent food quality control (Hassoun et al., 2023 ). For example, significant research efforts and advances in material sciences and nanotechnology have resulted in miniaturized portable, affordable, and easy-to-use devices, based on spectroscopy that are able to determine the food quality precisely and non-destructively (McClements, 2020; McVey et al., 2021 ). Four Industry 4.0 components, including blockchain, IoT, AI, and big data were recently identified as the main enablers of Food Traceability 4.0, i.e., tracing food in the era of Industry 4.0 with techniques and technologies that reflect this new revolution (Hassoun, Abdullah, et al., 2022 ). Many studies have reported that blockchain is a promising technology to improve traceability and resilience, prevent food fraud, reduce the carbon footprint of food production, and ensure the safety and authenticity of food all along the food chain (Creydt & Fischer, 2019; Kamilaris et al., 2019 ). The benefits of blockchain can be strengthened when applied in combination with other advanced technologies, such as IoT (Feng et al., 2020 ; Hassoun, Abdullah, et al., 2022 ). IoT- based solutions have the potential to strengthen food safety and food traceability throughout the food supply chain from farm to fork, thus reducing food-borne-related illnesses (Jagtap & Rahimifard, 2019 ). AI can help in detecting food fraud and prevent adulteration, increasing automation and digitalization, and achieving sustainable food systems in agriculture and the food industry (Marvin et al., 2022; Sinha et al., 2021 ). Big data can provide a large amount of effective information that enhances traceability and the visibility of key business processes, and improve decision-making (Jin et al., 2020; Misra et al., 2022; Rejeb et al., 2022 ).  5.4 Potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to produce new and healthier food products In recent years, growing consumer concerns for environmental and health issues have led to an increased interest in sustainable and healthy diets and accelerated the emergence of new food trends, such as functional foods, superfoods, and personalized foods (García-Oliveira et al., 2022 ; Hassoun, Bekhit, et al., 2022 ; Hassoun, Cropotova, et al., 2022 ; Hassoun, Harastani, et al., 2022). Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious perils for the achievement of the SDGs, highlighting the importance of resilience of the whole food system (Bisoffi et al., 2021; Weersink et al., 2021 ). Many Industry 4.0 elements have been suggested to address some of these challenges. For example, 3D printing and other smart food manufacturing systems could help to achieve sustainable food supply chains through monitoring food quality, increasing food variety, and reducing food waste, although various barriers are still facing the implementation of such technology (Verma et al., 2022 ). Moreover, many innovative strategies, empowered by numerous opportunities offered by emerging technologies, have been investigated to address major food sustainability challenges, such as food insecurity and food waste. For instance, increasing evidence shows that a range of bioactive compounds could be extracted from novel sources, such as micro and macro algae, insects, and food waste and by-products, and can be incorporated into food matrices for fortification purposes and enhancement of functional properties (Fasolin et al., 2019; García-Oliveira et al., 2022; Garcia-Perez et al., 2021 ).   6 Overview of the green revolution and emerging green technologies The Green Revolution started on 1960 promoted by the Nobel Prize Norman Borlaug with the aim of achieving self-sufficiency in food grains. The mission statement of the GR was to increase food production to fulfil world population food demands but not at the expense of the environment (Llewellyn, 2018 ). From that date, the GR has been diversified and applied to different fields, including the food sector (Djurfeldt, 2018 ). In parallel, food technologies for preservation, processing, extraction, and analysis have evolved from those conventional procedures to more innovative and environmentally friendly processes by reducing fossil energy use and hazardous solvents whereas avoiding water loss and residues generation (Fig. 5  ). Therefore, the design of green and sustainable processes is still a hot topic in the food industry (Chemat et al., 2017 ). 6.1 Green preservation technologies Food products are susceptible to microorganisms’ spoilage and enzymes, resultant in loss of organoleptic and nutritional qualities. Food preservation is aimed at controlling and preventing internal undesired enzymatic reactions and food-borne diseases to maintain microbiological safety and prolong product’s shelf-life (Chemat et al., 2017; Kerry & Tyuftin, 2017; Zhao et al., 2021 ). Traditionally, food preservation was performed using thermal treatments (freezing and pasteurization) as well as other conventional techniques, such as drying, smoking or salting (Wang, 2018 ). However, these techniques usually show some disadvantages, such as low efficiency, high cost, or inconvenience, which call for new trends that include advanced techniques for freezing and pasteurization assisted by high pressures, electricity, magnetism, ultrasounds or microwaves as environment-friendly alternatives (Bhagat & Chakraborty, 2022; Inanoglu et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2018 ). On the other hand, since mid-20th century, the packaging sector has mostly used plastic to replace other materials, such as glass or paper. Nowadays, the packaging sector is responsible for the 40 % of produced plastics and the food industry is the main end-user of such materials. In this context, bioplastics (bio-based and biodegradable materials) have emerged as a suitable alternative to replace or minimize the use of conventional plastics. Edible films and coatings are being increasingly studied due to various advantages over synthetic materials used for food packaging, including retarded food degradation, shelf-life extension, lack of toxicity and environmental friendliness (Abdel-Naeem et al., 2021 ; Hassoun, Siddiqui, et al., 2022 ; Maciel et al., 2020 ). At the same time, research trends are focused on the development of greener alternative techniques such as nonthermal plasma (NTP), cold plasma (CP) technology, or nanotechnology (Bajpai et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2022 ). These technologies can be applied in combination with bio based or biodegradable food packaging systems, being biocompatible, safe, and significantly lower carbon footprint (Romani et al., 2020; Roy & Rhim, 2022 ). Moreover, the use of natural preservatives is also increasing due to consumers’ concern about synthetic additives and the search for natural strategies to extend the shelf-life of food products (Baptista et al., 2020; Wang, 2018 ).  6.2 Green processing technologies: Thermal and nonthermal procedures The current technological advances emerged in the age of Industry 4.0 have enabled a transformation of food production systems to meet new food production requirements, including less energy consumption and waste generation, improved food quality and safety, and more diversity and convenience to consumers (Chemat et al., 2017; Lorenzo et al., 2021 ). These transformations are in line with the SDGs established by the UN. The emergence of green technologies for food processing is based on thermal (ohmic heating (OH) and radio frequency (RF)) and nonthermal techniques (pulsed electric field (PEF), cold plasma (CP) or high-pressure processing (HPP), among others (Hassoun, Siddiqui, et al., 2022 ). Among thermal techniques, OH has shown to be an inexpensive and environmentally friendly technique based on the production of heat as a result of the exerted electrical resistance of the food product against the passing flow of electric current (Chen et al., 2010; Lafarga et al., 2021 ). OH has been applied to the processing and preserving of fruits and derived products, preserving their physicochemical and antioxidant properties (Alcántara-Zavala & de Dios Figueroa-Cárdenas, 2022; Barrón-García et al., 2022 ). RF uses electromagnetic waves to generate heat and shows some advantages over microwave heating due to its high energy efficiency, higher uniformity because of its deeper penetration depth, zero chemical residue and reduced environmental pollution (Jiao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022 ). For example, RF has been applied combined with oven cooking and to improve colour and texture and show lower weight loss and acrylamide content in sweet potatoes (Jiao et al., 2022 ). PEF and CP are related to high voltage pulsed technologies, and both employ similar food treatments experimental setup, whereas HPP involves the application of elevated pressure for a short time (Arshad, Abdul-Malek, Roobab, Munir, et al., 2021 ; Balasubramaniam, 2021 ). PEF has been used to produce lower-fat and healthier fried foods (Zhang et al., 2022 ) and can be used in combination with other techniques such as freezing to inactivate microorganisms and maintain physicochemical properties (Kang et al., 2022; Rios-Corripio et al., 2022 ). CP has been mostly used as a decontamination for food processing surfaces, in addition to its potential in food preservation (Katsigiannis et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022 ). Overall, nonthermal techniques enable avoiding structure alterations and adverse effects of heat on food products; however, more research is still necessary (Barbhuiya et al., 2021 ).  6.3 Green extraction technologies By the end of 20th century, Green Chemistry appeared as a new alternative for extraction, processing and analytical processes, characterized by the reduction or elimination of specific solvents, to intensify the cost-effective production while being more respectful to the environment and human health (Ferreira et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2022 ). Kjeldahl, Maceration, or Soxhlet were traditionally used because of their high extraction yields but they had high requirements of energy and solvents. Innovative techniques aim to minimize the use of solvents, time and energy costs, and maintain extraction yields in an ecofriendly way (Chemat et al., 2012 ). Microwave, supercritical fluids, ultrasound, steam current distillation, PEF, HHP, accelerated solvent, enzyme, rapid soli-liquid and OH assisted extractions are examples of these innovative techniques (Arun et al., 2020; Saberian et al., 2018 ). Moreover, using these techniques helps to minimize the use of conventional solvents or replace them by alternative green ones (Rodríguez García & Raghavan, 2021 ). Recently, ionic liquids (ILs), deep eutectic solvents (DESs), supercritical fluids (SPFs), thermomorphic and fluorous solvents have been highlighted to expand the capabilities of conventional solvents because of their easy preparation, biodegradability properties, and low toxicity (Freitas et al., 2021; Gullón et al., 2020; Hessel et al., 2022 ). Noteworthy, agro-food industries have become aware of the huge amount of waste generated along the production chain and suggested several strategies to alleviate this issue and meet the principles of circular economy (Baiano, 2014 ). Many initiatives have been undertaken to extract and recover bioactive compounds from food waste and by-products, being inexpensive, abundant and easy handling sources of these naturally occurring bioactive substances (Coman et al., 2020; Fierascu et al., 2019 ). However, the main limitations for the food industry are the heterogeneity of matrices, perishability, elevated microbial load, seasonality, and the feasibility of the processes. Therefore, optimization of extraction and recovery of bioactive compounds is still a very active research area towards the extraction of these compounds and the formulation of value-added products (Caldeira et al., 2020; Cristóbal et al., 2018; Freitas et al., 2021 ).  6.4 Green analytical techniques Green Chemistry have contributed to establish effective analytical approaches in the field of food safety and quality assessment (Ballesteros-Vivas et al., 2021; Kaur et al., 2021 ). High resolution chromatographic techniques (HRCT) and mass spectrometry (MS) methods have been developed for the high throughput non-targeted analysis of foods (Domínguez et al., 2020 ), with gas chromatography (GC–MS) and liquid chromatography (LC-MS) being the most common methods due to their high sensitivity, selectivity, and reliability (Kaur et al., 2021 ). However, Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) principles are directed towards the shift of these techniques to green solvents, especially ILs, DESs, and supramolecular solvents (Agrawal et al., 2022; Kaur et al., 2021 ). For example, ILs have been applied in HPLC and GC because of their ability to improve the resolution and separation efficiency in food and beverages samples (Fiorentini et al., 2022 ). Moreover, ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) is a recent subdiscipline of MS characterized of its low-power consumption in terms of energy and a dramatic reduction in the use of solvents, gas, and wastage (Molina-Díaz et al., 2019 ). For example, desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) and direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS) have been applied in food science to rapid characterize the phenolic profile in tea extract and to monitor the excessive supplement of flavourings in infant formula, respectively (Minglei et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2021 ). Moreover, the potential of spectroscopic techniques operating in the near infrared (NIR) or mid-infrared (MIR) regions has been widely investigated individually or coupled to hyperspectral image (HSI) and Raman spectroscopy (Hassoun, Siddiqui, et al., 2022 ; Pallone et al., 2018 ). These techniques are classified as GAC due to their high speed, low cost, non-destructive character, minimal sample preparation, and no generation of toxic waste, and safe and easy use for the operator (Pallone et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the development of portable instrumentation, such as HSI sensors or nanoparticles based sensors, for real-time applications has been accelerated with promises to revolutionize analytical methods in the food industry (Ballesteros-Vivas et al., 2021; Bülbül et al., 2015; Geelen et al., 2015 ). These portable systems could minimize sampling and transport thus avoiding pollution and associated risks while becoming more accessible worldwide contributing to reach SDGs (Ballesteros-Vivas et al., 2021 ).   7 Connections between green technologies and the sustainable development Goals Despite the significant efforts of actors in agriculture and food industry sectors in response to UN’s 2030 SDGs program, the conventional food processing presents some lacks in terms of energy efficiency and waste management (Aoude et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2015 ). In this sense, green technologies such HPP, PEF, and US constitute a useful alternative in food processing to reach food safety and security sustainable goals, as well as environmental and economic sustainability objectives (Knorr et al., 2011; Picart-Palmade et al., 2019 ). Concerning the principal contributions towards sustainability, these technologies showed promising results in spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms’ inactivation, as well as in promoting or inhibiting enzymes activities, being effective to inactivate enzymes responsible of food deterioration without a considerable impact on the productś quality (Barba, Parniakov, et al., 2015 ). Over the last years, these green technologies have also been proposed as useful tools to remove and mitigate food contaminants, such as pesticides and mycotoxins (Gavahian et al., 2020 ). Other interesting application of these technologies in environmental and economic sustainability, consist of the recovery of valuable compounds from food waste and by-products. Moreover, these technologies constitute an efficient and cost-effective alternative in the industry to be applied in processes such as freezing and drying, as can be seen in Fig. 6   (Barba, Terefe, et al., 2015 ). 7.1 Green technologies and food safety and security Food contamination by pathogenic spore-forming and spoilage microorganisms is one of the major concerns in the food industry. Traditional thermal processing allows pasteurization with a 5–6 log reduction in pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, but food quality can be negatively impacted. Microorganisḿ sensitivity to green technologies differs according to different factors, such as the size and shape of the cell and its external layers morphology (Barba et al., 2017 ; Yamamoto et al., 2021 ). Generally, resistance decreases as follows: spores > fungi (moulds) > yeasts > gram-positive bacteria > gram-negative bacteria (Zinoviadou et al., 2015 ). However, the effect of these technologies on virus inactivation has been less studied (Pexara & Govaris, 2020 ). Several studies have shown that green technologies are effective on the inactivation of different foodborne pathogens such as L. monocytogenes , Salmonella spp ., E. coli , S. aureus  and B. subtilis,  among other microorganisms, especially when these technologies are combined between them or with other methods (Liu et al., 2017; Sagong et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2021 ). The protein denaturation, the compromise of cells functions, the production of membrane pores, the cell membrane break, the formation of free radicals, the leakage of intracellular compounds and the entry of the extracellular substances are some of the mechanisms related with the antimicrobial potential of green technologies (Podolak et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020 ). In food contaminants removal, the effectiveness of green technologies depends on several other parameters, such as processing conditions, the type of pesticide/mycotoxin and the composition of food matrix. Although green technologies can give good results in pesticides and mycotoxins degradation, their mechanisms of action have not been cleared yet. Some authors attributed it to a physical transportation of toxins, whereas other suggested that these technologies facilitate the reaction of toxins with reactive groups originated during the treatment or present in food (Gavahian et al., 2020 ). The information available in literature reported variable reduction percentages, that sometimes reached near to 100 % for mycotoxins such as patulin, aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone, and pesticides, such as chlorpyrifos, dimethoate and diazinon (Avsaroglu et al., 2015; Iizuka et al., 2013; Kalagatur et al., 2018; Pallarés et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2012 ). Spoilage enzymes such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and pectin methyl esterase, are common in plant tissue, and contribute to color changes inducing enzymatic browning (Ali et al., 2020 ). In this sense, green technologies have demonstrated to be efficient stopping enzymatic browning without compromising the quality of plant products (Bleoanca et al., 2018; López-Gámez et al., 2020; Terefe et al., 2009 ). Green technologies cause low impact on nutritional and sensory properties and have shown promising results in several food industry processes. In this context, green technology can constitute and interesting alternative to processes such as drying in the food industry. The modification of the microstructures induced by green technologies can facilitate the water diffusion from cell membranes leading to rapid moisture transfer, improving drying kinetics with a minimal impact on final product quality and antioxidant thermolabile compounds such as anthocyanins, vitamin C, among others (Zhang et al., 2020 ).  7.2 Green technologies and environmental sustainability Green technologies generate environmental benefits by improving the energy efficiency of the process and reducing the use of non-renewable resources (Barba et al., 2016 ). Green technologies, such as green processing, have promising potential to reduce environmental pollution, address climate change, and create successful clean label food products (Nabi et al., 2021; Venugopal, 2022 ). During the food supply chain, a large amount of food is wasted or lost. This constitutes an environmental problem and makes necessary the investigation in food biowaste valorisation. The application of green technologies presents opportunities to reduce and valorise food waste and by-products and decrease their environmental impact. Green technologies constitute a good alternative to efficiently extraction of valuable compounds from food waste and by-products, overcoming the disadvantages of conventional extraction methods. These emerging technologies reduce the usage of extraction solvents or implement the use of generally recognized as safe solvents (GRAS), save time, energy, and cost compared to traditional extraction processes (Arshadi et al., 2016; Barba et al., 2016; Kumari et al., 2018 ). In this sense, several studies have evidenced that green technologies constitute a suitable tool in the recovery of valuable compounds, such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, essential oils, pigments, proteins, flavour compounds, enzymes, and dietary fibers from food wastes and by-products (Al Khawli et al., 2021; Andreou et al., 2020; Hassoun et al., 2021; Ninčević Grassino et al., 2020; Ozogul et al., 2021 ). In addition to reducing and valorising food waste and by-products, minimizing the carbon footprint is another important area for sustainable food development since the current food production systems (agriculture and food industry sectors) are responsible for a significant amount of GHG emissions (Crippa et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022 ). Traditional technologies, such as thermal food processing treatments, require high fossil energy inputs, which emits large amounts of gases, while green technologies, such as non-thermal treatments, are characterized by lower energy requirement, thus a reduced environmental footprint (Arshad, Abdul-Malek, Roobab, Munir, et al., 2021 ; Clairand et al., 2020; Venugopal, 2022 ). A recent review focusing on food waste-related emissions highlighted the importance of reducing carbon footprint along the food value chain to support the transition to a sustainable and circular food supply chain (Al-Obadi et al., 2021 ). Another recent study presented several strategies that can be implemented to improve the energy efficiency and decarbonize the food processing sector (Clairand et al., 2020 ).  7.3 Green technologies and economic sustainability Green technologies can help to achieve the economic sustainability and accelerate the implementation of the concept of circular bioeconomy, through the increased efficiency in energy consumption, the profit made as a result of the decreased time and cost of food production, and the valorisation of food waste and by-products, among others (Arshad, Abdul-Malek, Roobab, Munir, et al., 2021 ; Venugopal, 2022 ). The main contribution of green technologies towards economic sustainability can be attributed to their ability to safe energy as most of these technologies are considered energy-efficient. For example, it was reported that the pre-treatment of food by one of the green processing technologies (e.g., PEF) can significantly reduce the energy requirement for further processing (Arshad, Abdul-Malek, Roobab, Munir, et al., 2021 ; Arshad, Abdul-Malek, Roobab, Qureshi, et al., 2021 ). The use of green technologies for the valorisation of food waste to produce energy or biofertilizers has gained more and more interests in recent years. It was argued that the production of biofuels and biofertilizer from food waste is economically viable and can improve both environmental and economic sustainability (Ma & Liu, 2019 ). The benefit gained through the recovery of bioactive compounds and other valuable components from food waste and by-products using green technologies has been highlighted in my publications (Arshad, Abdul-Malek, Roobab, Munir, et al., 2021 ).   8 Conclusions The global economic, social, and environmental challenges have recently become more acute than ever before, especially during and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling for innovative approaches to enhancing food sustainability and accelerating the achievement of SDGs in agriculture and the food industry. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the up-to-date research progress on green and Industry 4.0 technologies is provided to explore the role of these recent innovations and advanced technological development in accelerating the global transition towards sustainable food systems. The reviewed studies showed an increased interest in the application of green technologies, including green preservation (e.g., high pressure-assisted freezing and pasteurization, ultrasounds, and microwaves), extraction (e.g., microwave, supercritical fluids, ultrasound, PEF, and HHP), processing (e.g., OH, RF, PEF, CP, and HPP), and green analytical (e.g., DESI-MS, DART-MS, NIR, MIR, and HSI) techniques and approaches. Growing research shows the high potential of such technologies to enhance food safety and security and foster both economic and environmental sustainability. Indeed, compared to conventional techniques, most of these emerging technologies require less energy and could improve yield and reduce pollution, ensuring more sustainable use of resources. Despite the demonstrated strong connections between green technologies and the SDGs, many of these technologies have only been tested at the laboratory scale and still need to be scaled up for industrial implementation. Currently, there are considerable research activities in progress regarding harnessing the potential of Industry 4.0 technologies for more automation and digitalization, and sustainable agriculture and food industries. Many studies have shown that different advanced technologies, such as AI, IoT, big data, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and digital twins, can impact intensively SDGs achievement and speed up the transition towards sustainable food systems. These technologies could provide a range of opportunities to implement the concept of smart factories and smart farms, increase food quality, safety, and traceability, reduce food waste and energy consumption, and develop novel and healthier food products, thus supporting food sustainability goals. However, the findings of this review provide evidence that the adoption of these technologies in the agriculture and food industry is still at an early stage due to a number of challenges. Lack of digital infrastructure, technical skills, and the investment required for the implementation of new technologies, in addition to privacy and security issues related to data are among the common obstacles of most Industry 4.0 technologies. Therefore, more research should be expected on digitalization and green transition to build more sustainable green digital food future.
