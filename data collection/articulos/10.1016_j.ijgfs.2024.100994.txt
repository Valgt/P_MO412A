                  This study probed into the indicators that chefs should possess for developing culinary innovation when practicing sustainable development goals (SDGs). The interview outline in this study was designed based on five SDG indicators, including SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (good health and well-being), SDG4 (quality education), SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG17 (partnerships for the goals). The interview results were categorized according to seven constructs for culinary innovation. A modified Delphi method was employed to develop the indicators for culinary innovation and evaluate their importance. After an evaluation by 20 experts, a total of seven main indicators comprising 78 item indicators were generated, including the indicators for product (ten items), culture (ten items), management (16 items), service (eight items), aesthetics (six items), creativity (ten items), and technique (18 items). The product indicator was the most important, followed by the creativity and technique indicators.

The SDGs, a collection of 17 interlinked objectives for sustainable development, demonstrate the United Nations’ awareness that actions in one area will simultaneously affect other areas. This underscores the necessity of striking a balance across social, economic, and environmental sectors when it comes to global development in order to achieve sustainability. Since the formulation of the SDGs in 2015, numerous industries have worked relentlessly toward realizing these goals, expecting to achieve substantial progress by 2030 (Ali et al., 2020 ). However, human activities have caused substantial harm to environmental systems and health. This has made the achievement of a sustainable food system a pressing challenge of paramount importance, which has drawn attention from various stakeholders (Jamal and Budke, 2020 ). Food waste is a global concern. Numerous studies have explored issues related to food waste and proposed relevant strategies (Principato et al., 2018 ). As estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the value of the food lost or wasted every year in the global food supply chain reaches approximately USD 940 billion. Meanwhile, the FAO has discovered that reducing food loss and waste can help prevent global economic losses and relieve global economic burdens, particularly for vulnerable groups (Craig, 2015 ). Research statistics show that more than 820 million people worldwide are plagued by hunger; however, global food waste surpasses 1.3 billion tons every year (Barricman, 2011 ). In Taiwan alone, 2.2 million tons of food is wasted every year (TPFBA, 2020 ), with only 33% recycled for use and the rest disposed of as waste (DEPTCG, 2018 ). Due to factors such as easier access to food, rapid development, and the increasingly booming economy, food waste and surpluses have surged, and the situation is steadily worsening (Huang et al., 2020 ). These problems are mainly attributed to various processes in the market, restaurants, hotels, and households. For example, ingredients and products often spoil or expire before being prepared into dishes, leading to their disposal as food waste (Bell and Ulhas, 2020 ). However, food issues in the environmental dimension are not solely caused by spoilage, and there is a need to address this urgent and complex problem (Vasylieva and James Jr, 2021 ). Driven by the ongoing trend toward sustainable development in recent decades, discussions and innovation surrounding sustainable development in the food service industry have gained substantial momentum (Gössling and Hall, 2022 ). Major practical methods related to sustainability are linked to the chef’s creativity (Huang and Hall, 2023 ), underscoring the necessity to develop a sustainable menu. Additionally, the critical factors that could affect consumers’ decisions lie in the chef’s competence and concept of sustainability (Babakhani et al., 2019 ). Therefore, since the adoption of the 17 SDGs by the United Nations in 2015, a number of culinary innovation competitions have been held that adhere to scoring standards based on food-conserving and low-carbon cooking methods, the utilization of local and seasonal ingredients, and the incorporation of elements such as the SDGs into the innovation process. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the sustainable development of the culinary arts. However, creativity is a complex process that spans ideation to the introduction of new products (Horng et al., 2009 ), and it is considered a problem-solving process. In the process of culinary creativity, one can consider avoiding food waste and aim to achieve sustainability goals from the source to the final product. Therefore, this study aimed to combine sustainability and culinary innovation to develop indicators for culinary innovation from the perspective of sustainability, and then reflect upon the effects of sustainable development on culinary innovation from the perspective of social practice.  2 Literature review 2.1 Correlation between SDGs and hospitality The fundamental concept of environmental sustainability involves protecting nature so that future generations can enjoy an environment that is as good as or even better than the existing one (Redjeki et al., 2020 ). However, there is a symbiotic relationship between human survival and environmental health. This means humans depend on the resources provided by the environment to sustain life, including fresh air, clean water, and safe spaces. Therefore, environmental sustainability is a solution to all environmental issues and a means of saving and enhancing the future. More importantly, human beings should protect nature through eco-friendly lifestyles (Cetindamar and Kilitcioglu, 2013 ). Studies in recent years have suggested that supply chain management plays a pivotal role in enhancing environmental sustainability. In other words, efficient supply chain management procedures contribute to both the improvement and maintenance of environmental sustainability. Thus, using environmentally friendly materials and ingredients to preserve the quality of raw and supplied materials can substantially support environmental sustainability. Additionally, the continuation of disposal models for surplus food is another critical factor that affects the maintenance of environmental sustainability. Untari and Satria (2024)  indicated that three factors play a key role in maintaining environmental sustainability, including proper ingredient usage, preparation methods, and disposal models for surplus food. Driven by globalization, urbanization, and cutting-edge technologies, modern cuisine has become a blend of tradition and innovation. The farm-to-table movement and practices in sustainable development reflect people’s emphasis on food production and the factors that affect consumer decisions (Rajan, 2023 ). As the global environmental crisis becomes increasingly urgent, the food service industry, acting as a major contributor to the environment, has emerged as a crucial area for sustainable development reform. Currently, most sustainability-related studies focus on how to adapt and adjust practices to seek a more sustainable solution (Najmi et al., 2023 ). The relationship between food and cuisine has become increasingly complex and involves multiple facets. More specifically, food is more than sustenance; it has become a reflection of culture, history, and social development in the contemporary era (Rajan, 2023 ). In contrast, the key aspects of culinary activities include empowering the local community and other dimensions concerning stakeholders, knowledge preservation and dissemination, cultural heritage protection, identity enhancement, and internationalization. This means culinary activities are no longer merely economic activities (Hribar et al., 2021 ). In this regard, the dominant role of culinary activities in leisure and social well-being is substantiated (Getz et al., 2015 ). Therefore, ecological culinary products can reflect the ecological state of the environment where they are created (Agyabeng-Mensah et al., 2021 ). Effective supply chain management contributes to the production of top-notch products, with the ultimate goal of fostering and preserving environmental sustainability, which is a critical factor to be reckoned with (Untari and Satria, 2024 ). In the process of comparing the extent of global food waste and the number of people who continue to suffer from hunger, the need for sustainable culinary systems and reducing the associated food waste becomes particularly apparent. Food waste constitutes 17% of global food production, and in 2020, 9.9% of the world’s population faced hunger (FAO, 2021 ). Simply increasing food production to feed the global population without encouraging more sustainable consumption will only exacerbate the harm to the environment (Hall, 2020 ). Suhairom et al. (2019)  held that technical competence is a significant factor in the sustainable development of an individual’s career. In cultural terms, a chef’s ability to master the cuisine preparation, ingredients, and presentation can contribute to the delivery of enhanced culinary value. With the global rise of food tourism, chefs must be able to offer a diverse array of culinary products that can represent international cultures. Sustainable culinary systems are the foundation of sustainable food tourism. However, despite the continual growth in the literature about sustainable culinary systems, there is a lack of studies oriented toward practice (Grèzes-Bürcher and Grèzes, 2023 ). Nevertheless, as indicated by Kaura et al. (2022) , traditional and modern chefs’ thinking has a significant influence on dietary trends and culinary innovation. Current studies are mainly geared toward changing culinary education, with the hope of cultivating a group of new-generation chefs capable of implementing environmentally sustainable menus through teaching programs and advocacy. In parallel, these studies promote the cultivation of sustainable chefs and cooking. Sustainable diets serve as a pivotal factor in driving the world toward sustainability. Therefore, this study adopted a report from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs in 2021 on the integration of five SDGs into today’s culinary innovations as the initial focus, including SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (good health and well-being), SDG4 (quality education), SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG17 (partnerships for the goals).  2.2 Sustainable culinary arts The crisis caused by global warming has posed challenges such as climate change and food shortages to people worldwide. Among these challenges, food loss and waste are among the primary threats to food security (FAO, 2013 ) and are obstacles to the sustainability of the global food systems. Additionally, climate change, biodiversity, and pollution have exacerbated food insecurity. According to the Food Waste Index Report issued by the United Nations Environment Programme, 17% of the total food available to consumers in 2019 ended up disposed of as waste. Furthermore, this report highlighted that roughly 30% of agricultural land globally is dedicated to producing food that is ultimately lost or wasted, and that 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions result from unconsumed food (Annunziata et al., 2022 ). Food loss and waste stemming from surplus food occur in each process of the supply chain, adversely impacting environmental, social, and economic development, and persistently damaging the planet (Rodrigues et al., 2021 ). The amount of food waste depends on crop production choices, models, distribution channel structures, consumer purchases, and dietary habits (Gustavsson et al., 2011 ). Wang et al. (2018)  highlighted that one of the primary causes of food waste is the discarding of vegetables and fruit during the production process due to an unattractive appearance or non-compliant specifications. Meanwhile, the appearance defects of ingredients in the kitchen often lead them to be discarded as waste, which signifies that these defective ingredients cannot be sold in the retail process. Chefs and surplus food closely correlate (Ko and Lu, 2021 ). Wang et al. (2018)  held that chefs with an awareness of environmental sustainability, surplus food, and green food play a pivotal role in improving and addressing dietary issues, reducing food waste, and contributing to avoiding food waste and creating food value. The FAO (2013)  emphasized that a mere 25% reduction in food waste is sufficient to feed the global population. Food waste is closely related to people’s dietary habits and behaviors. Routine business transactions, interactions, and household practices all cause food to end up in kitchen waste bins (Plessz, 2016 ). This underscores the necessity to define food waste in order to effectively manage food waste. The issue of food waste has long been a significant but neglected concern (Cicatiello et al., 2017 ). The FAO (2022)  pointed out that the overall operation of the current food system has been proven unsustainable. Therefore, a thorough reform that is aimed at developing a sustainable food system is imperative. The ultimate goal is to ensure that economic, social, and environmental foundations will not jeopardize the food security and nutritional foundation of future generations (FAO, 2021 ).  2.3 Culinary innovation The culinary arts are a discipline under gastronomy that involves the development of both modern and ancient culinary techniques to preserve the nutritional value and appearance of food and contribute to a better culinary culture. They are combined with fine arts, music, philosophy, science, and etiquette (Santich, 2004 ). Additionally, the culinary arts are a discipline integrated with food science, food preparation knowledge, culinary techniques, food culture, and aesthetic arts (Hu and Liu, 2012 ). Hu (2010)  suggested that the essence of the culinary arts should go beyond food to consider the cultural connotations, aesthetics, and ideas and services conveyed by culinary practices. In other words, a chef’s innovation is akin to an artist’s creativity, which requires the removal of all constraints to unleash creativity. Therefore, creative chefs are like artists who are capable of processing ingredients in a special way. They beautify ingredients and add a touch of vibrancy to dishes, thereby imbuing them with unique meaning (Hu and Liu, 2012 ). Innovation is a combination of complex elements (Runco, 1996 ). Relevant studies have suggested that creative culinary artists are usually imaginative, curious, sensitive, passionate, confident, and enthusiastic about the arts. They are open to new ideas and able to take reasonable risks, and they are also achievement-oriented and persistent (Horng and Lee, 2006 ). During creative culinary practice, it is necessary to consider the characteristics and nature of the products in order to develop novel, practicable, and harmonious dishes. Furthermore, dish presentation should focus on basic skills, professional preparation, flavor, seasonings, attractive appearances, ingredient processing, and ideas (Horng et al., 2009 ). Hu (2010)  identified seven constructs in a study on the core competitiveness model for the development of culinary innovation, including product, culture, management, service, aesthetics, creativity, and technique. Since the United Nations’ 17 SDGs were placed under the global spotlight, numerous businesses, raw material suppliers, and educational institutes have organized culinary competitions around the theme of sustainability. In Asia, the 17 SDGs have been gradually incorporated into the scoring criteria of culinary competitions, in the hope of promoting the concepts and novel techniques related to sustainable culinary arts through competitions. In summary, the culinary arts and creativity closely correlate. It is necessary to cultivate creative culinary professionals with professional skills that can facilitate the development of differentiated and novel products, thereby contributing to the achievement of the vision outlined in the SDGs for the environment. Based on the arguments of scholars and an assessment of the research content, this study adopted the seven constructs that affect creativity as identified by Hu (2010)  in the study on the core competitiveness model for the development of culinary innovation, including product, culture, management, service, aesthetics, creativity, and technique, and integrated them with the SDGs for exploration and analysis. Due to the growing significance of sustainability in the food and beverage industry, the integration of culinary creativity has become a critical aspect of hospitality innovation. Achieving sustainable practices necessitates collaboration among industry, government, and academia. Therefore, this study will employ the modified Delphi method to develop indicators based on expert perspectives.   3 Methodology Based on the United Nations’ SDGs and relevant domestic and overseas literature, this study developed an interview outline to delve into culinary innovation-related connotations from the perspective of the SDGs. Due to the preliminary of research on the professional competencies of chefs combining SDGs and culinary creativity, this study will begin with interviews and the modified Delphi method. Then, an expert interview was conducted, and the literature data were sorted out and compared to distill the initial indicators. In the process, a modified Delphi method was adopted, which involved questionnaire surveys and anonymous discussions among experts and scholars to reach a consensus on the indicators for culinary innovation from the perspective of the SDGs and on the ranking of these indicators in terms of their importance. The modified Delphi method primarily involves initially structuring the indicators and obtaining anonymous feedback on the questionnaire items from the experts. Generally, after 2–3 rounds of expert questionnaire feedback, consistency of information can be achieved. This method’s advantage is that it can focus on the research topic to facilitate consensus Gustafson et al. (1973) . 3.1 Instrument First, an expert interview was conducted with five culinary professionals who had more than ten years of working experience in the food service industry as well as culinary teaching experience. These interviewees all have industry culinary experience and relevant sustainability competition experience. After expert interviews, the preliminary indicators of culinary creativity ability focused on sustainable development goals were classified using the seven dimensions of culinary creativity by Hu (2010) , and then analyzed using the modified Delphi method. The selection of experts for this study primarily involved experts from the industry and academia who have participated in culinary competitions related to food waste prevention and sustainability issues. Concerning the Delphi method survey, the expert panel was composed of 20 experts and scholars from the food service industry, government agencies, and educational institutes (Table 1  ). These members included three experts from government official, three culinary program instructors from vocational high schools, five culinary program instructors from colleges, and nine culinary managerial chefs from restaurants, including hotels, independent restaurants, restaurant chains, and catering company. Three rounds of Delphi surveys were conducted to reach a consensus within the expert panel, and in each round, revisions and improvements were made based on the suggestions proposed by the experts and scholars until an agreement was reached.  3.2 Questionnaire design The interview outline used in this study was designed based on relevant scales and theoretical studies on culinary innovation from domestic and overseas literature and in combination with literature on five of the SDGs, including SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (good health and well-being), SDG4 (quality education), SDG12 (responsible consumption and production), and SDG17 (partnerships for the goals). Based on the core competitiveness model for the development of culinary innovation proposed by Hu (2010) , the content of the expert interviews was distilled into seven constructs concerning creativity, including the product construct, the culture construct, the management construct, the service construct, the aesthetics construct, the creativity construct, and the technique construct. The product construct, the example of a questionnaire is as “the culinary professional’s ability to design products with different effects, different styles, and uniqueness according to the needs”. The culture construct, as example questionnaire is “the culinary professional’s ability to adeptly apply historical and local knowledge to culinary innovation according to diverse cultures”. The management construct, as example questionnaire is “the environmental skills and strategies that culinary professionals should possess”. The service construct, as example questionnaire is “communication between culinary professionals and customers in order to create new added value”. The aesthetics construct, as example questionnaire is “the culinary professional’s aesthetic capability of reshaping the market trend”. The creativity construct, as example questionnaire is “the culinary professional’s ability to address various problems”. Finally, the technique construct, as example questionnaire is “required the culinary professionals to gain knowledge of basic physical and chemical theories”. The interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview method, and the content was subsequently synthesized (Mouly, 1978 ). The interview process was fully recorded, and transcripts were coded verbatim. Content analysis of the recordings was conducted to identify meaningful keywords, which were then synthesized and categorized into these seven major dimensions. The questionnaire was scored on a five-point Likert scale to rate the importance of each item, with 1 representing very unimportant and 5 meaning very important. A total of 20 experts were invited to participate in three rounds of surveys, and each round involved revisions and improvements based on the opinions of the experts until a consensus was reached.  3.3 Data analysis With respect to the data collected, the modified Delphi method was employed to test the consistency among the experts’ opinions, and SPSS version 25 was used to analyze the relevant data. The modified Delphi questionnaire used in this study was implemented to check the consistency of opinions among the experts (Faherty, 1979 ), and the questionnaire was evaluated using the quartile deviation, mean, and standard deviation as the criteria, in order to gain a detailed understanding of the results. Murry Jr and Hammons (1995)  suggested that when the mean is greater than or equal to 4.0, the item meets the importance standard set by the expert panel and should be retained. All factors in this study were ranked in terms of their importance according to the mean. A higher mean indicated greater importance. Next, a quartile deviation analysis was conducted to evaluate the consistency of the opinions on the item among the members of the Delphi panel. According to Holden and Wedman (1993) , the quartile deviation should range between 0.60 and 1.00. If the quartile deviation is greater than 1, it indicates the failure of the experts to reach a consensus over the indicator. The stability was evaluated by referencing the opinions of Holden and Wedman (1993) , who suggested that if all the respondents reached a consensus over 85% of the question items, it could be regarded as reaching the stability standard, and the investigation could stop. Finally, descriptive statistics were used to analyze the preliminary data collected, including the sample size, frequency distribution table, percentage, mean, and standard deviation.   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Results of the third modified Delphi method The extraction process involved two stages: initially, through interviews to confirm preliminary indicators (including 7 main indicators and 81 items). Subsequently, after three rounds of expert modified Delphi surveys involving additions and deletions of questions. After three rounds of modified Delphi surveys, the results of the statistical analysis contributed to the identification of the items for the main and item indicators for culinary innovation from the perspective of sustainable development. All tables present the statistical analysis results derived from the third round of the Delphi questionnaire survey concerning the main (Table 2  ) and item indicators (Tables 3–9        ) related to the exploration of culinary innovation competence from the perspective of sustainable development. According to the two tables, the mean values of the main and item indicators all exceeded 4.00. Additionally, the quartile deviations for all indicator items were below or equal to 1.00, indicating that none of them met the deletion criteria (a mean less than 4.00 and a quartile deviation greater than or equal to 2). Therefore, all indicators were retained. After the analysis, ten items were under the product construct, ten items were under the culture construct, 16 items were under the management construct, eight items were under the service construct, six items were under the aesthetic construct, ten items were under the creativity construct, and 18 items were under the technique construct. In total, there were seven main indicators and 78 secondary indicators.  4.2 Analysis and discussion of the importance of the indicators With respect to the importance of the main indicators (see Table 2 ), the product construct came first among the seven main indicators in terms of importance, while the culture construct was ranked low. A product is the final outcome of a chef’s creativity. In the product construct, the item indicator A4 (design products that meet the market demand) was deemed the most important ability that culinary professionals should possess during creation that is oriented toward sustainable development. According tou Chang and Chiu (2008) , market demand is a key factor in today’s business environment. Studies have also suggested that innovative green products represent potential business opportunities and that green practice and competition constitute a win-win situation (Porter and Linder, 1995 ). Other business systems have many successful cases of driving the development of green products to meet market demand and thus propelling the market toward sustainable development (Lin et al., 2013 ). Among the cultural indicators, two item indicators, B1 (understand local ingredients) and B4 (understand the local food culture), were considered two crucial abilities that culinary professionals should possess. Hall (2020)  suggested that incorporating vegetarian options or increasing the number of vegetarian dishes on the menu will not lead to a sustained food revolution in the food service industry. This is particularly true when the ingredients of these dishes are imported or sourced from newly developed lands, which is often at the expense of local farmers’ interests. Therefore, an effective way to maintain environmental sustainability (Hall, 2020 ) lies in thoroughly understanding the supply chain for the ingredients of dishes served to consumers and their origins (Hall and Gössling, 2016 ). In terms of management skills, C1 (design proper dishes with consideration for ingredient costs) was considered the most important item indicator in the management construct. According to Andreyeva et al. (2010) , the price of a dish influences consumers’ decisions to choose healthy or unhealthy options. Studies have also indicated that the price fluctuations of dishes could affect the dietary choices of high-risk individuals (Powell and Chaloupka, 2009 ), thereby becoming a force that affects public health (Jha et al., 2006 ). Additionally, C5 (enhance ingredient usage to reduce wastage) was another crucial topic in sustainable management. Service is a function can create added value through the communication between chefs and customers. In the service construct, D6 (master consumer psychology by knowing what the customers want and the cuisine they desire) was considered the most important ability that culinary professionals should possess. Studies on green consumption should define environmentally responsible consumption behavior more clearly in conceptual terms. Mastering consumer demands and actively promoting green consumption are also seen as responsibilities for industries and businesses (Hutton and Ahtola, 1991 ; Kempton, 1991 ; Bell, 1994 ; Niva and Timonen, 2001 ). Aesthetics is a trend where a chef’s aesthetic ability is driven by the demand in the new market. In this construct, E1 (have the ability to design products that are both visually attractive and irresistible to consumers) and E5 (be proficient in food design, including the appearance, taste, and presentation) were two key item indicators. The appearance of a product not only serves to attract consumers but also is the key to retaining them (Wang and Lu, 2022 ). Over the past few decades, there has been a growing global concern among customers for sustainable products (Rahmi et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, the appearance and design of products with green concepts has become the orientation of today’s consumer demand and a significant reason why consumers prioritize such purchases (Alamsyah et al., 2018 ). F6 (develop new types of dishes using locally abundant products) was deemed the most important item indicator in the creativity construct. With the rising awareness of producing green entrepreneurial products and the promotion of sustainable development globally (Alamsyah et al., 2018 ), the development of dishes that will contribute to alleviating the burden on the Earth has become a mainstream trend (Hall, 2019 ). Technique refers to a chef’s ability to understand the chemical and physical properties of food, ingredients, or culinary science. Technical knowledge can be used to streamline energy usage, save time, and improve productivity. In the technique construct, the following six item indicators were considered the most important: G4 (cook properly to avoid unnecessary waste); G8 (have the ability to assess the freshness of ingredients); G10 (understand the properties of different ingredients for effective processing and extended freshness); G13 (place a high value on food safety and hygiene); G14 (master different culinary techniques and skills); and G15 (design dishes based on the unique characteristics of ingredients). According to Rodgers (2009) , techniques are seen as the contributors, creators, protectors, and enhancers of consumer experiences in the culinary context. Innovative culinary techniques can streamline operations, boost revenue, minimize costs, and fortify competitive advantages (Hu, 2010 ). Therefore, techniques play an indispensable role in promoting innovation reform. Belasco (2008)  suggested that delicious food is based on “a set of principles for incorporating flavor into basic food, preparation techniques, and consumption rules.” The infrastructure that brings food from farm to table, coupled with the chef’s culinary innovation, translates into diverse and unique dishes. To comprehend the components of food, it is necessary to understand the ingredients used, their sources, and how they are used to prepare all dishes. Furthermore, how each dish is presented, including the desired flavors and recommended consumption ways, should be covered. These components, alongside hospitality considerations such as how to welcome guests to take a seat for a meal, are crucial to the food service industry (Hall et al., 2003 ; Long, 2004 ). However, in a world plagued by food insecurity and obesity, insects, including pollinators such as bees, have seen a drastic decline, while rainforests are being deforested to produce palm oil or graze more cattle and wild fishery resources are being depleted and collapsing. Global warming also poses a survival threat to numerous communities and species. In such a context, consumers’ desired diets have become a critical issue that affects the food service industry in achieving sustainable development (Ambelu et al., 2018 ). Alonso, Kok, and O’Brien (2018)  aptly highlighted that the food service and hospitality industries have yet to fully commit to sustainable practices. Therefore, in the pursuit of the United Nations’ SDGs, efforts should start with reducing the impact of these industries on global environmental changes. According to the above analysis, the cultivation of sustainable chefs and the development of new sustainable diets (Kaura et al., 2022 ) through culinary innovation are identified as a truly just and safe relationship between the food service industry and gastronomy (Lingham et al., 2023 ).   5 Conclusion and recommendations 5.1 Conclusion This study used interviews and a modified Delphi method to establish seven main indicators comprising 78 item indicators. A total of seven ability constructs were identified, including the constructs of product (10 items), culture (10 items), management (16 items), service (10 items), aesthetics (6 items), creativity 10 items), and technique (18 items). These main indicators for sustainable culinary innovation were ranked in terms of importance as product, technique, creativity, management, aesthetics, culture, and services, with culture and services having the same ranking. This study also ranked the most important item indicators under each main indicator. The most important indicator for the product construct was designing products that meet the market demand, while that for the culture construct was understanding local ingredients. The most important indicator for the management construct was designing proper dishes with consideration for ingredient costs, while that for the service construct was mastering consumer psychology. The most important indicator for the aesthetics construct was having the ability to design products that are both visually attractive and irresistible to consumers, while that for the creativity construct was developing new types of dishes using locally abundant products. Finally, the most important indicators for the technique construct were cooking properly to avoid unnecessary waste, having the ability to assess the freshness of ingredients, understanding the properties of different ingredients for effective processing and extended freshness, placing a high value on food safety and hygiene, mastering different culinary techniques and skills, and designing dishes based on the unique characteristics of the ingredients.  5.2 Recommendations 5.2.1 Recommendations for culinary professionals This study highlighted the important abilities for culinary innovation from the perspective of sustainable development. These abilities were ranked in the order of product, technique, creativity, management, aesthetics, culture, and service, with culture and service having the same ranking. The technique, management, and culture constructs mainly emphasize culinary professionals’ understanding of sustainable development and whether they are equipped with correct concepts and sufficient knowledge regarding ingredients. The effective application of these insights to the planning for innovative sustainable products, as well as the mastery of abilities in products, creativity, aesthetics, and service, could help to develop products that meet both market and customer demands and contribute to the practical promotion of sustainable development in the hospitality industry. Professional skills can be accumulated by adhering to the following directions: (1) Chefs should gain a profound understanding of local food cultures and use wholesome and natural ingredients, as well as minimize ingredient waste generated in the preparation process, present dishes that embody the concept of zero food waste for consumers to practice in their daily lives, and break free from creative constraints. (2) Chefs should step out of the kitchen and step into the source to ensure the story, safety, and nutritional value of the ingredients. They should gain an intimate knowledge of ingredients, including their origins, in order to develop dishes based on the properties of the ingredients. By getting out of the kitchen and sharing the stories behind the ingredients, chefs can forge connections with customers and convey the concept of sustainability to a broader audience. (3) Chefs should consider operational costs and menu pricing through shortening the food mileage and reducing carbon emissions. Culinary professionals should recognize that food mileage is a significant factor in assessing the environmental impact of food production. In order to significantly lessen the environmental impact of human diets, chefs should prioritize using seasonal, local, and environmentally friendly agricultural ingredients.  5.2.2 Recommendations for businesses in the food service industry Today’s consumers are more concerned about global issues than ever. Nowadays, their focus goes beyond food quality; they place a high value on whether businesses in the food service industry share similar philosophies in business operations (Yang, 2019). Businesses should consider the following recommendations: (1) Businesses should prioritize sustainable business opportunities and recognize the shift in consumption patterns. Consumers highly favor sustainable products. Brands that stay abreast of the latest trends in supply and innovation concerning sustainable products will seize a competitive advantage in the market. Sustainable food service not only lies in the ingredients used but also involves the environment and services, ranging from restaurant decor and culinary methods to ingredient selection. This means sustainability can be implemented in various aspects. (2)Businesses should stablish and promote sustainable management policies and cultivate sustainable enterprises. The most prominent hallmark of sustainable development lies in its universality, which means it should be widely understood. This goes beyond corporate social responsibility (CSR) and even includes environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, with the ultimate goal of achieving the SDGs. Businesses should internalize the SDGs into their daily cultures or business processes. In order to make their activities more competitive, businesses can opt for projects concerning products or campaigns of which the recognition can be enhanced, which can have a profound effect on employees and consumers. Therefore, businesses should stay updated on global changes in sustainable development and support government policies. They should also offer the latest information on sustainability and carry out employee training and discussions, as these efforts will contribute to the emergence of more creative ideas on sustainability in the future.  5.2.3 Recommendations for the government Governments should formulate and promote policies that drive all restaurants in Taiwan toward the same goal of sustainable development, which is an interconnected goal that requires collective efforts for success. To this end, the government can organize culinary competitions related to sustainable innovation and promote policies on relevant events. Governments should encourage cooperation between local restaurants and local farmers. The carbon footprint of a simple product is affected by a myriad of factors. For example, there is a sharp difference in carbon emissions between local and imported ingredients (Ariel, 2020 ). Therefore, through the Food and Agricultural Education Act promoted by the government, coupled with programs for cooperation between businesses and farmers, the government can foster a positive relationship between both sides. By uniting as one, it is possible to decelerate global energy consumption and achieve authentic sustainable development.   5.3 Implications for management practices and social implications 5.3.1 Implications for management practices This study explored the development of professional competence indicators for sustainable culinary innovation. It not only can support businesses in different systems in the food service industry on their journey toward global SDGs but also guide employees (both in managerial and non-managerial roles) to engage in the development of new sustainable culinary products and analyze existing products for sustainable improvements. The goal is to deepen the understanding of sustainable development in Taiwan’s food service industry, thereby propelling the industry toward green development. The development of indicators for sustainable culinary innovation could enhance the review of creative culinary professionals and facilitate the promotion of sustainable development policies within companies.  5.3.2 Social implications In order to promote sustainable development in Taiwan’s hospitality industry, relevant policies on advocating sustainability have been developed. However, apart from them, detailed implications for the integration of sustainability into culinary innovation have not been explicitly outlined. This study delved into the development of indicators for culinary innovation from the perspective of sustainable development, with the goal of encouraging relevant food service sectors in Taiwan to consider sustainability issues when engaging in culinary innovation. In educational terms, this study also promoted relevant creative culinary ideas with a focus on sustainability, thereby contributing to global (and Taiwan’s) sustainable development. The ultimate goal is to enhance the sustainability of our planet through joint efforts.   5.4 Future research and limitations This study explored the preliminary development of indicators for sustainable culinary innovation. Future studies may use these indicators to design a questionnaire and administer it among kitchen staff to assess the implementation of sustainable development by food service sectors in different systems in Taiwan. Targeted improvements can then be made after the assessment to address deficiencies in the chef’s professional competence or relevant measures provided by the businesses. This study focused only on the development of indicators for sustainable culinary innovation in the food service industry. Future studies are recommended to conduct detailed explorations into segmented industries, such as Chinese cuisine, Western cuisine, and baked goods, as well as businesses in different systems, such as hotels, restaurants, and group meals. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the contributions and shortcomings of the current food service industry in sustainable development and allow businesses to make more friendly improvements, thereby achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development together. The indicator items in this study were answered and modified mainly based on the subjective opinions and perceptions of the research team. Therefore, personal factors may have caused bias in the results. The scholars participating in this study were professionals from relevant industries, and they may have been influenced by the companies they were working for and their positions, leading to subjectivity in their recommendations for certain items. This study primarily explores sustainable innovation from the perspective of experts. Future research could involve a larger sample of kitchen staffs to validate reliability and validity, aiming to develop a more comprehensive questionnaire. This could serve as an assessment tool for evaluating the professional competencies of kitchen staffs.   Implications for gastronomy in this study ● Implications for management practices    This study explored the development of professional competence indicators for sustainable culinary innovation. It not only can support businesses in different systems in the food service industry on their journey toward global SDGs but also guide employees (both in managerial and non-managerial roles) to engage in the development of new sustainable culinary products and analyze existing products for sustainable improvements. The goal is to deepen the understanding of sustainable development in Taiwan’s food service industry, thereby propelling the industry toward green development. The development of indicators for sustainable culinary innovation could enhance the review of creative culinary professionals and facilitate the promotion of sustainable development policies within companies.● 5.3.2 Social implications    In order to promote sustainable development in Taiwan’s hospitality industry, relevant policies on advocating sustainability have been developed.
