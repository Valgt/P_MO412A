Therefore, global efforts should focus on achieving these. Herein, we discuss the contribution of electrobiotechnology to the realization of the SDGs.   Keywords sustainable development goals  electrobiotechnology  microbial fuel cell  microbial electrosynthesis  electrobioremediation    The United Nations SDGs to realize a sustainable future The SDGs (https://sdgs.un.org/goals ), set up by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, are a blueprint for today’s environmental, social, and economic challenges. The implementation requires a collaboration between different actors in government, industry, civil society, and science. Some SDGs are more, some less directly linked to R&D projects in biotechnology. However, most SDGs can only be achieved through novel, sustainable processes in industry, the municipal sector, and domestic households. This article highlights electrobiotechnology processes and focuses on their contribution to the SDGs.  Electrobiotechnology combining electrical efficiency and biological selectivity The main objective of electrobiotechnology is to combine the strengths of electrochemistry and biotechnology to develop efficient processes. Therefore, the high selectivity and stability of biocatalysts (microorganisms or enzymes) are combined with the high energy efficiency of electrochemical reaction steps. Either integration of the reactions into one reactor or separation into two steps can be advantageous. The importance of electrochemical processes has come to the fore because of the need for increased electricity supply as well as power grid and electrical energy storage expansion due to increased green energy production. Electrobiotechnological processes may replace existing chemical ones or lead to new processes or products. Their main applications are the purification of water or soil and the generation of electrical energy as well as the production of chemicals. Furthermore, the possibility to utilize CO2  for the production of carbon-based materials or the fixation of nitrogen are also beneficial applications of electrobiotechnology. In order to meet the SDGs, it is elementary that energy and substrates come from renewable and sustainable sources.  Electrobiotechnological processes and their contribution to the SDGs Electrobiotechnology contributes mainly to the SDGs referring to environmental and technical issues and less to social and economic ones (Figure 1  ). The relevance of electrobiotechnological processes to SDG 9 (Industry, innovation, and infrastructure) is almost universal since electrobiotechnology is a part of the bioeconomy and enables innovative industrial production processes and contributes to infrastructural aspects (e.g., generation of electrical energy, water treatment). SDG 2 (Zero hunger): electrobiotechnological production of a bio-based fertilizer The Haber-Bosch process for artificial nitrogen fixation is the most common way for today’s production of ammonia. In this process, atmospheric N2  and H2  are converted to NH3  by using a metal catalyst at high temperatures and pressures. Ammonia is a chemical mainly used for production of urea, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium phosphate. These substances are used as fertilizers and contribute to the nutrition of a large part of the world's population. The naturally occurring enzyme, nitrogenase, catalyzes the similar reduction of nitrogen to ammonia at ambient pressure and temperature and thus is highly energy efficient. The Minteer group developed an electroenzymatic ammonia-producing system with a nitrogenase immobilized within a specifically designed neutral-red-modified redox polymer [1 ]. Certainly, the productivity of the Haber-Bosch and the electroenzymatic process are currently not comparable. Nevertheless, in case of success, such an electrobiotechnological process might contribute to achieve SDG 2 (Zero hunger) by providing a sustainable, bio-based fertilizer. Furthermore, the electrobiotechnological process development for ammonia production could have a strong impact on SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and 13 (Climate action) by replacing high energy-consuming procedures like the Haber-Bosch process. Coupled bioelectrochemical processes are also capable of producing single cell proteins from air [2 ] and contributing to SDGs 2, 12, and 13.  SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) plus SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy): electrobiotechnology in wastewater treatment Water is the basis of life on our planet and thus a precious commodity. Maintaining good water quality is therefore not only important for our health and well-being but also for the life on earth and below water. To achieve clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), wastewater as well as drinking water must be treated, particularly with increasing water scarcity. Here, electrobiotechnology might contribute to a circular water economy. Thereby, research focuses on the development of a sustainable and energy efficient process [3 ]. The degradation of wastewater components, in particular carbon [4 ,5 ], nitrate [5 ], as well as removal of antibiotic resistance genes [6 ], can be improved through bioelectrochemical systems. This organic waste still has a high energy content. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are bioelectrochemical systems that use this energy to generate electricity. This process is enabled by the ability of microbes to oxidize organic matter and emit electrons directly to an electrode. MFCs are used in sewage treatment plants on a technical scale [7 ]. An MFC was coupled with a biofilter in a pilot-scale application for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery [4 ]. Such an efficient energy and carbon recovery contributes to a responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) as well as to an additional, affordable, and clean energy source (SDG 7). Through the purification ability, the process also contributes to the clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) goal and to the good health and well-being (SDG 3) goal because potential pathogens (e.g., fecal coliforms) are also removed [4 ].  SDG 13 (Climate action): electrobiotechnological production based on CO2  CO2  is a greenhouse gas, which is accumulating in the atmosphere and is a frequent byproduct of industrial processes. Minimizing the amount of CO2  produced by any process is hence an SDG. To reduce or avoid CO2  emissions released for energy generation by the combustion of fossil fuels, renewable energy sources can be used. Nevertheless, for some processes, such as biogas generation or lime production (necessary for concrete manufacturing), CO2  is an unavoidable byproduct. Here, conversion of the emitted CO2  with a bioelectrochemical system might be a sustainable alternative. CO2  has been converted directly or via an intermediate to different industrial relevant chemicals, such as methane [8 ], acetate [9 ], polymer bricks [10 ], or bioplastic [polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)] [11 ]. In the majority of these processes, high energy and carbon efficiencies are the main features. Recently, the coupling of an anodic electrochemical synthesis of the fuel additive n-octane and a microbial conversion of the cathodically produced coproducts hydrogen and CO2  to isopropanol was developed with Faradaic efficiencies up to 80% [12 ]. Stöckl et al.  presented a two-step process for the production of bioplastic, first converting CO2  electrochemically to formate and then in a second step using microorganisms to produce PHB [11 ]. The advantage of this drop-in synthesis is that after the electrosynthesis no downstream processing is necessary [11 ]. Since CO2  is stored chemically in PHB, this process contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (SDG 13, Climate action). Haas et al . developed a similar industrial system, where CO2  and H2 O were reduced electrochemically to syngas, which was converted to butanol and hexanol through fermentation [13 ].  SDG 14 (Life below water) plus SDG 15 (Life on land): electrobioremediation of soils and water The pollution of land, water, and air is a major concern confronted by the SDGs. Regarding the life on land (SDG 15), a major challenge is persistent substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). In addition, these substances often also threaten good health and well-being (SDG 3) and must therefore be degraded before reusing contaminated land. Li et al . showed a 70% decrease of PAH over 182 days with electrobioremediation in a 160 l pilot-scale plant [14 ]. This is 30–45% more than using bioremediation alone [14 ]. For remediation, electrodes with 1 m distance to each other are built up on the contaminated area and a supply of water and nutrients is established, as well as a system to prevent further contamination. This kind of process can also be used for groundwater treatment, as shown by Ceballos-Escalera et al . [15 ]. In this case an electrobioremediation system was used for nitrate and arsenite removal from groundwater. This coupled reaction allows reduction of nitrate to nitrogen at the cathode and oxidation of arsenite with an efficiency of more than 95% [15 ].   Concluding remarks and future perspectives The potential contribution of electrobiotechnology to the SDGs was shown by different studies. Nevertheless, up-to-date technology has not been used at an industrial scale since there is still R&D necessary (e.g., scale-up, integration in existing production plants, optimization of the biocatalysts). The most important challenges are the long-term stability and the scalability of electrobiotechnological systems. Overcoming these challenges opens the way for electrobiotechnology to help achieve a prosperous and sustainable future.
