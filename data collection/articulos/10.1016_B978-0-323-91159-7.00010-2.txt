               Since biofuels are thought to be environmentally beneficial there has been a lot of interest in their study in the contemporary world. They are being seen as viable alternatives to fossil fuels. With regard to climate change and energy security, they play a critical role in advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As one of the most sophisticated alternative energy sources, biofuels are expected to play a significant role in achieving the UNSDGs. Biofuels generated from biomass, such as biogas, bioethanol, and biodiesel are increasingly becoming part of the contemporary energy mix in response to depleting fossil fuel supplies, fluctuating costs, and the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The use of biofuels in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been examined in this article.

Keywords Biofuels  Sustainable development  Goals  Energy sustainability  Energy policy  Environmental policy  Biodiesel  Bioethanol  Biomass   1 Introduction As the world's population continues to climb and people embrace higher living standards, the energy demand is rising at an unprecedented rate. Between 2019 and 2030, energy consumption was predicted to rise by 12% in models established before the COVID-19 crisis. Transportation, one of the most energy-intensive industries accounts for 92% of all oil consumption. Because of the extensive usage of fossil fuels carbon dioxide emissions becomes a major contributor to climate change, a worry for environment and human health (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2019; Eurostat, 2019 ; Perera, 2018 ). More than three-quarters of transportation fuel demand in 2018 was met by biofuels (93%), while the remaining was met by renewable power (6%). As a result of their significant potential to ameliorate climate change, biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol have been regarded attractive alternatives to fossil fuels for sustainable development (Demirbas, 2008 ; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2008 ). When it comes to cutting emissions of greenhouse gases to 80%–95% by 2050, environmental policies such as those outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement and the European Green Deal believe biofuels to be an essential part of the solution. The usage of biofuels in transportation is predicted to reach 17% globally by 2050 (IEA, 2019 ), with several nations, including the United States, Brazil, the European Union, and China, launching biofuel initiatives to lessen their reliance on fossil fuels (International Energy Agency, 2013 ). Bioethanol is the most widely used biofuel, accounting for 82% of all biofuel generated worldwide. America and Brazil produced ∼ 59.7 and 34.4 billion liters of it per year, respectively, in 2020 and 2019 (Barros et al., 2019 ; United States, 2010 ). After ethanol, the most extensively manufactured alternative fuel in the world is biodiesel, which is made by trans esterifying vegetable oils or animal fats. Additionally, biodiesel may also be produced from algae (a third-generation biofuel) (Zhang, 2016 ). With their high-octane number and high heat of vaporization (Erdiwansyah et al., 2019 ), biodiesel and bioethanol are both viable as gasoline mix additives or as pure fuels. In addition to renewable diesel (RD), another significant biofuel is HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil), often known as “second-generation biodiesel” or “green diesel” (No, 2014 ). This biofuel may be made from renewable feedstock including triglycerides and fatty acids by hydrotreating, gasification, and pyrolysis (Kalnes et al., 2007 ; Knothe, 2010 ; Singh et al., 2015 ; Zhang, 2016 ). Similar to biodiesel, it may be used as an additive or as a pure fuel in conventional engines. Other additional advantages of biofuels include reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By providing a more environmentally friendly transportation option, it can increase fuel supply diversity for the transportation industry. It can help diversify cropland and enhance local agriculture. It can also promote biofuel feedstocks based on their location and resources. If present combustion engines and gasoline stations are not ready to accept biofuels, biofuels can serve as an intermediate option until they are. Even though electricity is the fastest-growing source of vehicle fuel (energy), it is expected to account for less than 2% of transportation fuel consumption in the United States in 2050. It is critical to the EU's renewable energy mix to have a steady supply of bioenergy. The European Union has set itself the ambitious objective to increase the percentage of renewable sources in final energy consumption to 20% by 2020. In 2010, bioenergy was the source of around 7.5% of energy utilized in the EU. According to the European Environment Agency (EEA), emissions from renewable sources were expected to account for about half of total EU Member State electricity generation by 2020. Contrary to popular belief, biofuels have several drawbacks, chief among them being a threat to the availability of land and water resources. Furthermore, biofuels may be manufactured in a variety of ways, each resulting in a different environmental effect and a different level of engine performance. Multicriteria decision-making techniques (MCDM) are needed to identify the most convenient biofuels in terms of economic, environmental, and social sustainability (Zurano-Cervelló et al., 2019 ). Many studies have confirmed the effectiveness of these approaches in overcoming different environmental, social, economic, and technological challenges associated with energy planning (Kumar et al., 2017 ).  2 Biofuel in the energy sector The flexibility provided by bioenergy can help offset the growth of intermittent renewable resources like wind and solar. Biomass offers the fuel for efficient heating systems, furnaces, and cookstoves in the building industry. Liquid and gaseous biofuels, as well as electrification and improved vehicle economy, can all aid in reducing transportation's reliance on fossil fuels. At this point in time, the only viable alternative to fossil fuels for aircraft, sea transportation, and large freight transport is biofuels. With the use of liquid biofuels, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions while retaining the majority of our present vehicle fleet. There are several ways to make biofuels today, each with its own set of pros and cons in terms of ultimate cost and influence on the environment.  3 Sustainable biofuel expansion There is a tendency in the national media to focus on the narrower issues of energy prices, energy security, and climate change at the expense of the more fundamental concern of long-term sustainability, which means protecting life support systems, fostering economic growth, and improving societal well-being in the process of developing and using biofuels. Understanding how biofuel production and usage affect water, soil, animal habitat, biodiversity, climate change, and air quality as well as rural people's economic well-being are all critical considerations. Biofuels production and potentials, as well as feedstock sources, technology, funding, and international commerce, are all examined in this article. We will also discuss about what this means for food production, the environment, and the availability of land. Based on this, international collaboration, legislation, certification frameworks, and sustainability requirements for land use and mitigation of environmental consequences caused by biofuel production are all necessary if biofuel usage is to continue. Finally, the land use impact of substituting traditional animal feed with co-products of biofuel production is examined. 3.1 Biofuel and food nexus Over the next 40 years, agricultural productivity will have to expand by ∼ 60% because of the growing population (FAO, 2011 ). Loss of biodiversity with long-term implications is also becoming clear. 25% of agricultural land has already been degraded. Demand for food, feed, and fiber is expected to rise, putting a further strain on limited land and water resources, both of which may be threatened by climate change. Increasing crop demand as a source of energy feedstock might have a significant influence on food prices. Higher oil costs will lead to increased nonenergy demands on bioresources as well, since biomass may substitute the petrochemicals. Global energy supplies have nearly quadrupled in the previous 35 years, but renewables’ share of that growth has remained constant at roughly 13% (IEA Bioenergy, 2009 ). The global need for energy and the environmental damage caused by fossil fuel consumption is rising and it will be extremely difficult to minimize greenhouse gas emissions if we continue to rely on fossil fuels. As of now, bioenergy accounts for around 10% of world's energy supply and accounts around 80% of total renewable energy. Solar, wind, and biofuels (the so-called “new” renewables) have grown rapidly from a low starting point. Although they make up just a small portion of the world's renewable energy supply, they are steadily increasing in importance. The hunt for alternatives to fossil fuels, particularly those used in transportation, has been a key driving force behind the development of bioenergy. Historically, human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation sent huge quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. For bioethanol, most of the currently available biofuels use starch or sugary crops, while the rest come from oilseeds (for biodiesel). As a result of this, new research has focused on the utilization of lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as perennial grasses and short-rotation woody crops for bioenergy production (Crutzen, Heimlich, et al., 2008 ; Crutzen, Mosier, & Smith, 2008 ; Melillo et al., 2009 ; Schmer et al., 2008 ).  3.2 Bioenergy and biomass Biomass's technological potential is predicted in the literature to reach as high as 1500 EJ/year by 2050 (Smeets, Faaij, Lewandowski, & Turkenburg, 2007 ). Estimates of worldwide primary bioenergy potentials accessible around 2050 reported in the last 5 years span from 30 to 1300 EJ/year (Haberl et al., 2013 ). According to a study by Dornburg et al. (2010)  biomass has an energy yield of 0–1500 EJ, which is within the range of previous estimates. According to the study, the range in 2050 will be 200–500 EJ/year when water restrictions, biodiversity preservation, and food demand are all taken into account. Recently, the IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy (IPPC, 2012 ) indicated a large range of 50–500 EJ/year. The Global Energy Assessment (GEA, 2012 ) is also significant, with a 2050 potential of 160–270 EJ. The large range is attributable to the fact that different methods and assumptions about crop yields and available acreage have led to such disparate results. Batidzirai et al. (2012)  offered a fairly detailed summary of bioenergy potentials, especially analyzing the different forms of potential. The discrepancies in bioenergy resource assessment estimates are attributable to the large diversity of techniques, methodology, assumptions and datasets. The total annual aboveground net primary production on the Earth's terrestrial surface is estimated to be about 30–35 Gt carbon of biomass growth with a gross energy value of 1100–1260 EJ/year, assuming an average carbon content of 50% and 18 GJ/t average heating value, which can be compared with the current world primary energy supply of about 550 EJ/year (Haberl et al., 2007 ; Saugier et al., 2001 ). All harvested biomass utilized for food, fodder, fiber and forest products, when represented in equivalent heat content, amounts to 219 EJ/year. The worldwide harvest of key crops (cereals, oil crops, sugar crops, roots, tubers, and pulses) translates to around 60 EJ/year. In order to create that biomass, people impact or even destroy around an additional 70 EJ/year of biomass in the form of plant parts not collected and biomass burned in anthropogenic forest fires. The annual output of industrial Roundwood in the world is between 15 and 20 EJ (Erb et al., 2007 ; Haberl et al., 2007; Krausmann, 2001 ) and because of this, about 800–900 EJ/year of biomass is still left in the aboveground compartment of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. In order to fulfill their biomass requirement, people influence nearly three-quarters of the Earth′s ice-free land area with major repercussions for ecosystems and biodiversity (Erb et al., 2007 ). However, most biomass supply models that take into consideration sustainability restrictions, imply an annual potential of between 200 and 500 EJ/year. In alternative energy scenarios, bioenergy usage is estimated to be in the range of 150–400 EJ in the year 2100 (Edenhofer et al., 2010 ). Large-scale bioenergy production and concomitant extra need for irrigation may further aggravate current demands on water supplies (Fingerman et al., 2010 ). In tropical and subtropical developing nations, deforestation happens to owe to land clearance for additional crop- and pasture land but due to the usage of biomass for traditional heat and energy generation the release of forest carbon for bioenergy production has negative consequences since forests constitute substantial carbon storage (Gumpenberger et al., 2010 ). But deforestation not only eliminates a carbon sink but is also recognized as the biggest danger to terrestrial biodiversity as forests are the most ecologically diverse terrestrial ecosystems (Hassan et al., 2005 ). Naturalists thus advocate for the preservation of forests as a means of mitigating climate change (Barlow et al., 2007 ; Laurance, 2007 ). For the first time, the worldwide dynamic vegetation and water balance model has been integrated into the international land use and water use model as well as the global energy-economic-climate model (Popp et al., 2011 ). In the scenario without forest conservation, bioenergy demand climbs up to roughly 300 EJ in 2095 with a demand of about 100 EJ in 2055. Biomass from specialized bioenergy crops is expected to supply 25% of the entire world's demand for primary energy carriers in this scenario. However, forest exclusion for the goal of biodiversity protection and climate change mitigation affects the availability of cost-efficient biomass for energy generation. If forests are preserved to their original state, bioenergy production will drop to 70 EJ in 2055 and 270 EJ in 2095 (Popp et al., 2011 ).  3.3 Bioenergy and sustainability Recent years have seen a lot of discussion over the long-term viability of bioenergy. For the first time, metrics for long-term sustainability have been developed, with an emphasis on the direct consequences of bioenergy product manufacturing chains. But bioenergy may create major indirect consequences in other production systems too (Ros et al., 2010 ). It has been 2 years since the indirect land-use change (ILUC) impact has been widely explored in the literature (Crutzen, Heimlich, et al., 2008 ; Crutzen, Mosier, & Smith, 2008 ), and it is still being discussed (Fargione et al., 2008 ). However, extra crop yield can also be accomplished via improvements in land management (e.g., intensification). In many situations, ILUC emissions are measured as average yearly values over periods of 20–50 years (EU Directive for direct emissions). Over the course of time, typical emission levels range from 300 to 1600 t CO2  equivalent/ha for the conversion of forest into agricultural land and from 75 to 364 t CO2  equivalent/ha for grassland or savannah (Crutzen, Heimlich, et al., 2008 ; Crutzen, Mosier, & Smith, 2008 ; Fargione et al., 2008 ; Van Minnen, 2008 ). Fritsche (2009)  gave an average value of 5 t CO2  equivalent/ha per year. This number might be greater in areas where forest conversion is more common. As a byproduct of producing ethanol or any other bioenergy product, scientists may estimate how much land has been transformed using computer models. This has to be matched by the carbon reductions from biofuel usage, in many situations varying between 2 and 20 t/ha per year (Eickhout et al., 2008 ). The decrease in crude oil prices that might result from mandatory bioenergy production could lead to a rise in crude oil and overall energy consumption. This effect is fairly unknown but might reach as much as 50% of possible gains (Barker et al., 2009 ). Other analyses showed that the reduction in direct emissions resulted in an additional indirect emission of around 30%. So, these indirect emissions are in the range of 10%–40% of the emissions of the substituted fossil fuels (Ros et al., 2010 ). Inclusive multistakeholder procedures can identify places most suitable for bioenergy production (such as for agroecological zoning) as well as optimal arrangements for boosting beneficial production and development while avoiding or reducing probable negative impacts. As an illustration, contract farming offers small-scale farmers the chance to expand their land usage and generate new sources of revenue by selling a portion of their crops for bioenergy. Sustainable intensification and landscape design—increasing output per unit of land while maintaining or improving ecosystems’ health and productive capacity—can make land available for more production while boosting ecosystem services. So damaged land and ecosystems can be rehabilitated. Biomass demand for energy may be fulfilled by integrating innovative biomass production technologies into agriculture and forestry landscapes, by utilizing crop rotations, flexible crops (which may be used for many purposes), intercropping, and agroforestry practices (such as use of nitrogen-fixing energy crops to increase yields of surrounding food crops). The same land area may be used to generate a variety of bio-based goods, including food, feed, bioenergy feedstocks, and many more. Excess fertilization can cause soil erosion, compaction, salinization, and eutrophication of nearby bodies of water, but it can also improve biodiversity and reduce the negative effects on the terrestrial ecosystem. As food production increases to meet the needs of an expanding population, more organic wastes are generated in the fields. The remainder of animal bedding and nutrition (including residues now burnt in the field, with severe air pollution and climate change impacts), together with all processing residues, may be removed for bioenergy generation. Similarly, as wood output in forests rises to satisfy increased demand for conventional forest products such as lumber, pulp and paper, there is substantial potential to utilize process and manufacturing leftovers. It is also possible to use large amounts of forest wood for bioenergy that are now unused for industrial purposes (such as the wood of poor quality and wood resulting from natural disturbance). Forests will be healthier and more productive if sustainable forest management practices are followed.  3.4 Biofuels and sustainable development goals SDGs, such as ensuring food security, improving land use, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, may all be met using bioenergy as a significant and constructive means of attaining these objectives while also helping to meet the Paris Climate Change Agreement.• SDG-13: take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.  • SDG-7: ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.  • SDG-2: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.  • SDG-15: protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.    The Paris Agreement reiterates the “need to encourage universal access to sustainable energy” while asking for “action to maintain and expand … sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases” and for “reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.” In order to facilitate the spread of bioenergy in support of SDG implementation, rules and measures promoting best practices must be put in place. These should reflect the variance in circumstances between continents, provide biodiversity protections, and promote different ecological services in landscapes. This involves coordinated land management and engagement of individual farmers, landowners, policy-makers, and other local and national stakeholders. Trade-offs and synergies need to be discussed with key stakeholders who can give important information on the present land use and social, economic, and practical preconditions for ongoing as well as suggested new land uses. Knowledge and management expertise in the use of biomass for energy should be shared across areas to encourage best practices. This would permit the establishment of locally customized management recommendations. Several approaches can assist enhanced yields and encourage multifunctional land uses, providing sufficient food and animal feed for a growing population, as well as biomass for bioenergy and other useful biobased goods. Agricultural extension services may encourage acceptance of contemporary farming techniques and the development of excellent management practices at a local level, including agroforestry strategies for cultivating a combination of high-yielding food and fuel crops in varied soils and climates. Secure land tenure can provide financial incentives to farmers to manage their land for good harvests while preserving soil productivity. Transporting agricultural and forest leftovers may be made more cost-effective through the dissemination of logistics methods. Other measures can help improve the use of agricultural and forestry waste and leftovers. Guidelines to promote suitable residue extraction rates in various settings are the examples of encouraging sustainable residue usage through incentive programmes that support sustainable residue use. Soft loans for machinery can further encourage the scaling up of bioenergy systems that utilize leftovers and garbage as feedstock. It is also possible to produce biomass on degraded or marginal land, reducing competition for better-quality land and restoring soil productivity. A combination of financial incentives and information distribution about appropriate production techniques and past experience from prior programmes should be used to encourage the usage of such land while safeguarding vulnerable communities. Food chain losses could be reduced by promoting good harvesting techniques, investing in storage and refrigeration facilities, developing transportation infrastructure to safely deliver food to markets, discounting imperfect food items to encourage their sale, modifying labels to avoid the discard of food prematurely, and educating consumers to better match food purchases to their needs. Sustainable methods for producing food, feed, biofuel, and other necessities in the next decades can be found in a variety of guidance documents aimed at policymakers and industry practitioners alike.   4 Bioenergy integration in the bioeconomy It is important to note that the bioeconomy includes a wide range of other activities in addition to the production of bioenergy. These activities include the production of foodstuffs and agricultural fibers and goods such as biomaterials, bio-based chemicals, and medications. Bioeconomy policies may include increased efforts to map global soils, systematic monitoring of contributions to SDGs, development of skills and knowledge for bio-based materials in manufacturing and consumer products, demonstration projects of biorefineries combining the production of energy and higher value materials, and research on new food systems, sustainable aquaculture and artificial photosynthesis. Aside from general renewable energy objectives, regulations and financial incentives may also be included. The attitude toward biomass production for food, bioenergy, and other reasons should shift from a single end-user orientation to integrated production systems that provide high resource use efficiency and encourage sustainable production and usage. Such systems’ output should be handled with great care in order to avoid waste and increase efficiency while ensuring a sound resource base for future generations. The term “bioenergy” refers to a type of energy that may be generated from renewable natural resources and thereby take the place of fossil fuels. Energy crops, forest and crop leftovers, agro-industry wastes and byproducts, paper mill wastes, moist organic waste, and the organic part of municipal solid wastes are only a few of the many biological resources that may be exploited to create bioenergy. Macroalgae, seaweeds, and aquatic plants are also regarded as extremely interesting future biological resources (OECD/IEA, 2017 ). Regardless of the resource, bioenergy may be utilized as a sustainable source of power-producing heat, gas, and fuel to create heat, electricity, cogeneration and transportation fuels. More recently, biomass may also be utilized for the manufacture of biomaterials and bioproducts. The IEA's projections show, how critical it is to increase the use of bioenergy. According to IEA, bioenergy will offer roughly 17% of the ultimate energy requirement by 2060. A 20% reduction in total GHG emissions can be achieved by using bioenergy (OECD/IEA, 2017 ; Scarlat et al., 2015 ). These outstanding results must be reached in a sustainable fashion assisting to decarbonize the energy systems. Modern bioenergy is obtained by mature technologies currently available in the biomethane market from wastes and residues, heating networks, agricultural residues to generate electricity, and different transportation fuels, while other technologies, mostly related to transportation fuels are close to market (biomass gasification, pyrolysis and ethanol from lignocellulosic feedstock) and require additional support. We are still in the early stages of conceptualizing the bioeconomy. According to the OECD, bioeconomy refers to the collection of economic activities connected to the discovery, development, production, and use of biological products and processes. According to the same source, BE might deliver considerable future advantages relating to improvements in people's health, agriculture, and industrial productivity gains while boosting environmental sustainability (OECD International Futures Project, 2009 ). Other writers, such as McCormick and Kautto, define bioeconomy as an economic system based on the use of renewable biological resources for the production of raw materials, chemicals, and energy (McCormick & Kautto, 2013 ). According to the European Commission, BE refers to a system of economics based on the efficient and sustainable production of food, feed, fiber, biobased products, and bioenergy from renewable resources inland fisheries, and aquaculture, as well as public goods associated with these ecosystems (European Commission, 2012 ). It was later changed in 2014 to specify that efficient and sustainable primary production and processing fulfill industry demand, consumer expectations and solve environmental concerns including climate change (Van de Pas, 2015 ). According to some authors, the BE uses a variety of renewable biomass (trees, shrubs, crops and plantations, as well as algae and aquatic plants) in its production processes, resulting in a variety of outputs (thermal energy, liquid fuels, chemicals, bioproducts, food and fodder, cosmetics, and medicines; Adamowicz, 2017 ). More lately, BE has gone from being viewed as a promise to being an actual reality that will play a remarkable role when it comes to attaining global sustainability (Maciejczak, 2017 ). On the same line, the revised Bioeconomy Strategy and Action Plan broaden the definition of the BE, which must make connections with other industrial sectors (construction, engineering, manufacturing, information and communication technology, and urban planning) to make human activity more environmental friendly, more circular, more bio-based, more nature-inspired, more inclusive, and more competitive, and ultimately more sustainable (Rauschen & Esch, 2017 ). 4.1 Biofuel and future trends Over the next several years, the notion of BE will undoubtedly continue to change until a more specific and agreed definition is found. A new idea of economics that takes into consideration the environmental factors and recovery timeframes of “bio” raw materials, residues, and wastes must be pushed. For this aim, sustainable evaluations of bioenergy must address the three sustainability pillars: social, environmental, and economic, so that their conclusions might bias decision-makers toward those chains that are mostly good for the environment, society, and the economy. In this context, the sustainable use of bioenergy must improve the social, environmental, and economic advantages achieved from the better use of renewable resources in such growing BE. Significant reductions in GHG emissions (compared with fossil fuels) and support for the Sustainable Development Goals are two of the most important roles that bioenergy and BE are predicted to play. In order to reach GHG emission reduction objectives and limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius this century, the Paris Agreement calls for the replacement of renewable energy sources for fossil fuels as one of the mitigating strategies against climate change. For these objectives to be fulfilled, the participation of all parties, the essential support to poor countries, the proper finance funding, and a new technological framework development are required (Assembly, 2015 ). One cannot assume or generalize about the influence of bioenergy on the three pillars of sustainability. Bioenergy development may have both good and bad effects depending on how, where, when the biomass is generated, harvested, transported, and processed. To shed some light on this topic and given the relevance of sustainability in the present and future debate on bioenergy, various research projects have been carried out by the scientific community.   5 Opportunities and challenges of the biofuel sustainability transition Regional energy availability is often improved and fossil fuel dependence is reduced through the use of bioenergy. It may vitalize the forestry and agriculture industries and enable expanded use of renewable resources as feedstocks for a range of industrial operations. It can help us in achieving our social and environmental goals, besides the mitigation of global climate change. The cost of fossil fuels might stay competitive with carbon-free sources for decades given the predicted technical breakthroughs in discovering and extracting them. If we are to minimize climate concerns in a timely way, the speed of the adoption of clean-energy technology at a widely deployed commercial scale needs to be expedited. Although the implementation of any innovation will depend on its benefits relative to incumbent technology, inertia, as well as actual and perceived financial risks, always favor the status quo. Government policies are needed to encourage creativity and innovation and align market forces in order to expedite the implementation of commercially feasible clean-energy alternatives. With increases over the previous 30 years in the number of extreme weather events, such as temperature extremes, floods, wildfires, droughts and storms, the overall loss trend is beginning to reach $150 billion per year. There is emerging evidence that these shifts are associated with climate change. Although the complete costs of mitigating or adapting to these changes involve major uncertainties, competent risk management does not equate uncertainty with inactivity. Policies are needed that begin to integrate the actual cost of various sources of energy more directly into their market prices. Several of the difficulties and possibilities facing science, engineering, and policy are discussed in this Perspective. Our capacity to identify and exploit fossil fuels continues to improve, and economically recoverable resources throughout the world are expected to keep pace with the expanding demand for decades. We didn’t end the Stone Age because we ran out of stones; rather, we moved on to more effective alternatives. Clean energy and energy efficiency provide us with the same chance. The cost of renewable energy is fast becoming competitive with other forms of electricity. With more participation of the scientific, financial and public-policy sectors, as well as the general public, we can speed the transition to inexpensive, accessible and sustainable energy that will boost economic development, enhance energy security and lessen the dangers of climate change. On the other hand, to borrow from the IEA's World Energy Outlook, “If we don’t alter direction soon, we’ll wind up where we’re heading.” Bioenergy, on the other hand, may have negative consequences if it is not properly developed and applied. Problems like food security and land-use change from bioenergy expansion may raise carbon emissions or harm biodiversity, and obstacles in establishing economic competitiveness and providing high quality and cheap energy services. Specific bioenergy alternatives (such as biofuels derived from edible vs nonedible feedstocks) are not good or bad per se; sustainability implications are context-specific and rely on the location and management of feedstock production systems. Fortunately, sufficient knowledge and ability are available to control bioenergy growth so as to exploit potential and avoid risks of negative repercussions.   References Adamowicz, 2017 M.
