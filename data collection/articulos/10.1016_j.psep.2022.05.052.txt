                  Refused derived fuel (RDF) is one of the products of the MSWs that is effectively used as an energy source, especially in the cement industry. This work discusses the role of the RDF in the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the circular economy. Moreover, the barriers that challenge the widespread of the RDF are indicated. The RDF positively contributes to the most SDGs. However, the main contribution would be in SDG l: no poverty, SDG 3: good health and well-being, SDG 6: SDG 6: clean water and sanitation, SDG 7: affordable and clean Energy, SDG 8 decent work and economic growth, SDG 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12: responsible consumption and production, SDG 14: life below water and SDG 15: life on land. While in the main contribution of the circular economy comes from its ability to reuse municipal solid wastes, industrial solid waste, non-recyclable plastics, waste tires, biomass, paper/card, waste oils, and waste textiles. In addition, RDF will reduce the CO2 by up to 2155.3 106 Kt CO2/year and recover heat content from 2 to 5.5 Gcal/t. Moreover, the RDF will save up to 15% of the fuel that equals 4.92 tons/h. Such fuel reduction will save 486 USD/h in petcoke costs, with 2.27 tons/h of CO2 being emitted into the atmosphere at a net saving of 389 USD/h. The results guide academic researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders worldwide to evaluate solid wastes as alternative fuels concerning their overall sustainability and cheapness. Moreover, this work introduces some future research directions to involve solid wastes in circular economy and SDGs. Furthermore, a set of indicators are proposed to guide the stakeholder to increase the RDF contribution to SDGs and lower the possible trade-off.

Box 27272 Sharjah United Arab Emirates       Refused derived fuel (RDF) is one of the products of the MSWs that is effectively used as an energy source, especially in the cement industry. This work discusses the role of the RDF in the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the circular economy. Moreover, the barriers that challenge the widespread of the RDF are indicated. The RDF positively contributes to the most SDGs. However, the main contribution would be in SDG l: no poverty, SDG 3: good health and well-being, SDG 6: SDG 6: clean water and sanitation, SDG 7: affordable and clean Energy, SDG 8 decent work and economic growth, SDG 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure, SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12: responsible consumption and production, SDG 14: life below water and SDG 15: life on land. While in the main contribution of the circular economy comes from its ability to reuse municipal solid wastes, industrial solid waste, non-recyclable plastics, waste tires, biomass, paper/card, waste oils, and waste textiles. In addition, RDF will reduce the CO2  by up to 2155.3 106  Kt CO2 /year and recover heat content from 2 to 5.5 Gcal/t. Moreover, the RDF will save up to 15% of the fuel that equals 4.92 tons/h. Such fuel reduction will save 486 USD/h in petcoke costs, with 2.27 tons/h of CO2  being emitted into the atmosphere at a net saving of 389 USD/h. The results guide academic researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders worldwide to evaluate solid wastes as alternative fuels concerning their overall sustainability and cheapness. Moreover, this work introduces some future research directions to involve solid wastes in circular economy and SDGs. Furthermore, a set of indicators are proposed to guide the stakeholder to increase the RDF contribution to SDGs and lower the possible trade-off.   Keywords Refused derived fuel (RDF)  Municipal solid waste (MSW)  Circular economy  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Cement industry  Barriers    1 Introduction The big challenge for developing countries is introducing viable commercial sustainable usage of wastes. It’s a rule of thumb for emerging economies that the key to success in waste management systems is to aggregate waste into meaningful volumes and then develop an organized supply chain. The future of initial processing of the alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR) in small businesses scale could be applied with investing in shredding plastics and gathering it to be recycled (de Lorena Diniz Chaves et al., 2021; Tóth et al., 2020 ). A strong motivation to generate energy from waste is the Waste Framework Directive – Directive, 2008 /98/EC (Directive, 2008 ), highlighting the importance of recovery instead of disposal. Life Cycle Assessment is a significant methodology for assessing energy from wastes (Al-Muhtaseb et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022a ). It facilitates evaluation of the environmental impacts of materials during its life-cycle in addition to its management. LCA helps in the analyses whether recovery, reuse, reduction, or disposal is the best scenario for specific waste management (Huang et al., 2022b; Pokhrel et al., 2020 ). With continuous international developing in the fuel management, including dealing wisely with domestic production of fuels, as well as replacement of traditional fossil fuels with another of lower cost. Still, fuel importing is stressing load on any country’s reserve of foreign currencies. Countries are obligated to put in charge the cheapest fuel production process, which is the municipal solid wastes (MSW), as an alternative fuel (AF), including the refuse-derived fuels (RDF) (Grabowski and Smoliński, 2021 ). Governments in the developed countries and the management of international cement production companies are leading the utilization of RDF formed from MSW management. Applications of the AFs exhibited promising results for thermal substitution rates (TSR). But even with the current centralization of gathering, sorting, and processing the wastes, there is still a limitation in the international management system with much potential for saving the cost losses and maximizing the environmental gains. The sustainability of AFs implementation in clinker pyro-processing results from the developed technology and the diversity of the domestic AFRs. Moreover, process investigation is essential to find the most suitable RDF for a specific plant, according to the cost, availability of the fuel, continuity, heat content, physical and chemical properties, and finally, the impact on the quality of the clinker and cement. It is estimated that co-processing of 25,000 tons of AF instead of 7000 tons will increase the =TSR from 5% in 2020 to 20% in 2030 to produce one million tonnes of cement (Saha and Karstensen, 2019 ).  Fig. 1  shows the TSR % of utilization of alternative fuels in various countries worldwide where the highest contributor is Austria followed by Norway. The AFs are any non-fossil-based fuels that can replace part of the raw material needed for cement manufacturing, whether it is used for thermal energy or material recovery (Ghenai et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2021 ). These AFs are derived from plentiful waste materials worldwide; recently, co-processing of solid wastes in cement kilns has received increasing interest. Co-processing in the cement manufacturing process is considered an environmentally viable application of recovery selection, more preferred than landfilling and incineration, as entitled in the “Basel Convention” (United Nations Environment Program, 2014 ). Typically, wastes are entered in material recycling facilities (MRFs) where materials are already available for recycling. For example, some plastic bottles are separated for reuse, and the residual from wastes can be incinerated directly (Mohamed et al., 2017 ) or used as RDF. These include different technologies which offer recovering energy or generating electricity. The future target for the cement industry is to manufacture environmentally friendly cement (Mistri et al., 2021; Shehata et al., 2021 ). The commercial businesses implementing the AFs in cement manufacturing started in the middle of 1980 s, with a high acceleration of TSR up to 100% at the preheater calciner (Schneider et al., 2011 ). Cement manufacturing is one of the most suitable applications for that AFs could be applied in different handling designs (Kääntee et al., 2004 ). Waste minimization and reduction is a preferable scenario for waste management, followed by reusing and recycling. However, some waste materials can’t be reused due to their characteristics. Subsequently, the optimum scenario is to recycle it as AFs. Moreover, developing AFs from wastes achieves energy recovery via thermochemical conversion maximizing the overall benefits from the wastes (Elkhalifa et al., 2019; Iyamu et al., 2020; Naqvi et al., 2018 ). However, the transition of a country from a specific management system to a more advanced/efficient one depends on several factors like technological advancement, policies and legislative laws, environmental and socio-economic issues (Okot-Okumu and Nyenje, 2011 ) in addition to people's awareness and acceptance, governmental motivation, financial sustainability, and infrastructure.  Fig. 2  represents the waste generated worldwide. It is expected that this huge amount will be in continuous increase due to urbanization and industrialization. According to the World Bank, higher than one-third of waste generated in high-income countries is efficiently managed through composting and recycling. In contrast, 48% and 26% of waste generated in low-income countries are collected from cities and rural areas, respectively, and only 4% is recycled. Overall, 5.5% of global waste is composted, and 13.5% is recycled (World Bank, 2018 ). During the last three decades, many cement plants have been converted from oil-based heating to coal-based firing, and the new plants were equipped with the needed arrangements (Myint, 2011 ). In collaboration with their governments, some of the cement manufacturers agreed to import coal as a fuel for the cement industry to substitute diesel and natural gas entirely. Although coal has no available resources in some countries, it represents the most low-cost fuel. Coal and pet coke have been chosen as alternatives for diesel, heavy fuel oil, and natural gas due to their varied sources and markets (International Finance Corporation, 2016 ). However, the proposed switch to coal has faced several problems, including its potentially adverse environmental and health impacts, the procurement management conversion to import a fossil fuel with large quantities, and the lack of the infrastructure needed to support this switch. The bibliometric analysis and R-package were used to extract   Figs. 3 and 4 . The Bibliometrics analysis employs advanced quantitative analyses and numerical approaches to evaluate scientific output in a given field (Yao et al., 2018 ). Based on the literature reviews, the RDF was always linked to waste management, recycling, and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction (Fig. 3 ). Moreover, the literature reviews relived that the total number of papers related to the RDF has grown significantly during the last ten years, as shown in Fig. 4 . This can be linked to the increasing action of climate change impact and the importance of waste reduction and recycling. Although several studies discussed waste management and its impact on the economy and the environment, there is a lack of work concerning the contribution of alternative fuels (AFs) to the circular economy and sustainable development goals. Therefore, this work aims to highlight the potential role of solid waste management in circular economy, environmental sustainability, and sustainable development goals (SDGs). Giving a particular emphasis on the role of the RDF. This highlights the challenges facing solid waste opportunities worldwide. Also, this study gives a comprehensive analysis encompassing all recent studies on outcomes of wastes management in economical and environmental performance. Finally, set of indicators (guidelines or key performance indicators (KPIs)) were offered to increase the contribution of the RDF into the SDGs. 1.1 Alternative fuels in cement plants The cement manufacturing simply started with mining for the raw materials, which are basically limestone and clay, from the quarries as big-sized pieces. Then, size reduction through crushers, make them in piles separately, or in the mixed form under the control of quality monitoring devices like Gama rays continuous inspection, to stack the raw materials in piles for primary homogenizing followed by transferring these raw materials through mills for grinding, to be stored in silos for blending process. After mixing, the raw materials become the kiln feed, which flows to pre-calcination in the preheater, then to pyro processing in kiln to produce “clinker”, representing the major heat and energy consumption product. In the end, clinker is ground with gypsum in cement mills to produce cement (Kääntee et al., 2004 ). A total of 6.1 million tons of other wastes were incorporated as fuels in cement kilns in Europe. To increase energy efficiency and save fossil fuel, the burning conditions should be optimized, the wastes should have adequate heating values, and the kilns should be designed to burn wastes (Scalet, 2013 ). Fuel is fed basically into two main points in the cement manufacturing process ( Fig. 5 ). The first point at the preheating system, which is currently in modern designs, included the major fuel, and the second point at the end of the kiln. The AF could be introduced at any of the two points, as the modern technologies updated the kiln burners from a single channel for one fuel to multi-channel burners, which have the facility of introducing many types of fuels. Nowadays, AF has its channel at the kiln burners. Besides, it is introduced to the preheating system in separated nozzles. Its insertion point to the system is very sensitive and critical not to affect the preheating system's thermal profile or the gas flow speed or volume. Finally, it is introduced mainly to save fossil fuels by replacing them partially. Competitiveness is still in progress to reach the alternatives of fossil fuels to the optimum percentage.  1.2 Criteria of AFs to be used in cement plants Essential criteria must be met to select definite waste to be applied as AFs for a cement plant. For example, their suitability for the cement plants, abundance and continuity of wastes stream to the plant, the relative availability of data for the cement producers, proximity to cement plants, and environmental and health impacts (International Finance Corporation, 2016 ). To assess the suitability of waste material to be considered an alternative fuel, testing is required for several key parameters. The basic tests routinely undertaken for waste fuels are energy measurement (moisture content, chemical measurements (Hewlett and Liska, 2019 ) (proximate and ultimate analysis, heavy metals, halides, ash content, biomass content) and physical tests (bulk density, particle size, and distribution and waste characterization by manual sorting) (Parrodi et al., 2019 ). The energetic characteristic of MSWs has been investigated using wastes from different countries, e.g., Malaysia (Abdulyekeen et al., 2021 ), Greece (Komilis et al., 2012 ), Sri Lanka (Menikpura and Basnayake, 2009 ), India (Malav et al., 2020 ), etc. Considering a material to be a fuel requires basic criteria like its physical state, percentage of heavy metals and circulating elements (sodium, chloride, potassium, and sulfur), the content of volatiles, calorific value, physical properties (scrap size, density, homogeneity), grinding properties, ash composition and content, moisture content and generated emissions (Rahman et al., 2015 ). In addition, AFs used in cement production plants must be used in specific quantities and proportions that agree with the raw materials to achieve the desired balance of material composition in the cement kiln. Also, alternative fuels should be introduced to adequate zones of the kiln. For example, materials that contain a lot of volatile matter should be fed only into the high-temperature zone. Materials that have mercury must be avoided (Scalet, 2013 ). Although the heating value of the tires-derived fuel is higher than that of bituminous coal (Rahman et al., 2015 ), and it is limited to be introduced directly to the kiln owing to the presence of a large quantity of Zinc in the remaining ash, which can change the clinker composition (Usón et al., 2013 ). The AFs composition must be known first to decide its effectiveness to be used in a cement plant. Plants’ choice is usually based on price, availability (Rahman et al., 2015 ), in addition to compatibility with the process and plant design. Composition's most important parameters are; moisture and volatile matter (VM) percentage (Kääntee et al., 2004 ). Environmentally, the European Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Bureau (EIPPCB) have identified many advantages specific to the kiln system, which would help in the destruction of organic pollutants as a result of high temperatures as well as sufficient retention time. This typically resulted in the same –or lesser- amount or dioxins and furans, volatile organic compounds and emissions of the heavy metal (WBCSD) - Cement Sustainability Initiative.  1.3 Challenges and barriers towards AFs Although of the several advantages of the AFs, the usage of the AFs still faces several challenges. The improper disposal of waste materials hinders the vital use of alternative fuels and investment. Additionally, increasing amounts of MSW, strict environmental laws/regulations, increasing disposal and treatment costs, safety, public health, and environmental impact of MSW should be assessed (Reza et al., 2013 ). In the case of implementation of AF in the cement sector, still, the alternative fuel contributes partially to the total fuel supplied to the cement kiln. This is attributed to the non-uniform size and composition of the RDF. As a result, it has heterogonous chemical and physical properties. These properties influence the flame intensity, shape, and stability, and thus affecting the heat transfer to the clinker (VDZ, 2018 ). Various studies discussed the implementation of AF in cement plants. For example; Computational fluid dynamics simulations were implemented for a rotary kiln in a cement plant; the fuel was a mixture of pulverized coal and RDF. The characteristics of the thermal conversion and the aerodynamics of the RDF particles were described by advanced models. The results show that the partial substitution of the lignite by RDF lowered gas and clinker temperatures in the sintering zone, affecting the clinker characteristics (Pieper et al., 2020 ).  Table 1  summarized main challenges and barriers in general with particular references to the potential application of solid wastes, agricultural waste, sewage sludge, and tire-based fuel worldwide.   2 Circular economy (CE) (SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production) Conceptualization of circular economy (CE), whether it is a new or refurbished concept, aims to offer an alternative to the current linear economic system. CE is formed on the natural cycle, which appraises a fully stabilized operation. No waste is involved in the CE; instead, there is a new derivation of assets if wastes are adequately treated and reappraised (Gardetti, 2019; O'Grady et al., 2021 ). For circular cities, decision-makers need close monitoring of material cycles with a database of the production and treatment of wastes (Zeller et al., 2019 ). Today, the emergence of the circular economy is paid with the acceleration of how goods and services are produced and consumed, including definite conformity in the procedures simulating that in nature with innovative, creative, applicable, and clear ideas (Gardetti, 2019 ). Continuous efforts were elaborated, seeking for a more sustainable economy, including action plans developed by the European Commission into strategic packages. The 2018 package targets recycling 70% of municipal waste by 2030 (European Commission 2018). Case studies of CE were investigated. For instance, Corral et al. (Corral et al., 2018 ) performed it in Camisea Gas Project in Peru. The authors discussed how this project mitigates risks to the surrounding environment and improves the local economy in Peru. Unlike, linear consumption which is closed to the limits, CE guarantees economic improvement, job opportunities, releasing/reducing pressure on resources and thinking outside the box. In Denmark, there are some successful implemented circular business models. One of these models is initiated by Aalborg University and Shilder and Brown. They replaced conventional cotton with organic cotton. Gabriel Co. developed another model where they produced dyed fabrics without heavy metals from reused PET resulting in integration into new resource cycle at disposal (The Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). However, reusing waste materials as higher-value products would bring financial benefits via increasing materia value. This is owning to that the upgrading processes of the reused material would increase the value of the renewable energy investments. Subsequently, CE would act as an aid for energy transition (Kiviranta et al., 2020 ). The big challenges facing developing and developed countries are introducing viable commercial sustainable usages of wastes with beneficial targets and managing solid wastes smartly. China has represented a model of circular economy success, with the achievement of up to 63 megatons of oil equivalent (mtoe); (17%). Also, USA persisted a replacement up to 72 mtoe, that representing 20% (BP’s Economics team, 2016 ). Currently, cement plants have a diversity of available fuels, with positive potentials for circular-based fuels. AFs include many different types; the most popular materials to be used in cement kilns are: waste oils, shredded residues, waste plastics, waste tires, and sewage sludge. Slaughterhouse wastes offered a new source to AFs in recent years. Considering historical prices of fuels, it was found that the fossils were much economically efficient for usage in cement kilns in the past decade. Nowadays, after correction of prices to cope with those of the international market free, its prices being close to the global market ( Fig. 6 ). It has also led to coping with the global tendency towards circular businesses using alternatives while working on improving their mechanisms with regard to their collecting, processing, and burning into different applications. 2.1 Recovered materials from RDF Using AFs in the cement industry maximizes the recovery of the non-combustible constituents of the wastes and reduces non-renewable fossil fuels (coal and petcoke). Moreover, slag or the ash of the AF after combustion compensates for the raw materials of cement; subsequently, they conserve natural resources (Environmental Protection Agency, 2008 ). On the other hand, the presence of the ash of the alternative fuel could improve the compressive strength and acceleration of the hydration reactions of the final product. This is attributed to the similarity of this ash with the compositions of the raw materials. For example, rubber and plastic wastes include the same oxides of the Portland cement (Hashem et al., 2019 ). Alternative fuels include waste tires, biomass, plastics, paper/card, waste oils, waste, waste textiles, and others. Some of these materials have useful minerals, and others have considerable heating values (Georgiopoulou and Lyberatos, 2018 ). For example, although sewage sludge has a low heating value, its ash yield valuable minerals for the clinker matrix (Holcim, 2006 ).  Fig. 7 a and b shows the main materials that could be recovered from RDF. Fig. (7 c) shows the compositions of the ash residue resulting from RDF combustion consists of typical industrial solid wastes (electronic packing wastes and automotive stamping gaskets), anaerobic digestion sludge and industrial desiccant residue (Li et al., 2021 ). The main oxides and heavy metals in the combusted residue were MgO, SiO2 , CaO and Al2 O3 , and Cd, Pb, Cr, Ti, Cu, Ni, and Sr, respectively. However, the compounds detected were non-toxic or low-toxic (Hameed et al., 2021 ). Compared to pure coal-fired power plant (Wang et al., 2018 ), the heavy metals detected in the combustion residue were mostly lower than its average value. It meets the requirements of the emission standard of pollution control on the municipal waste incineration (GB 18485–2014) (Wang et al., 2020 ) as well as standard for air pollutants for thermal power plants (GB13223–2011) (Wang et al., 2019 ). Although numerous studies reported the formation of different heavy metals such as Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Pb, S, Sb, Se, Sn, V, Zn and their oxides in the residue of RDF after burning (Han et al., 2021; Hernandez-Atonal et al., 2007; Tripathi and Rao, 2022 ), there is no significant studies focus on the utilization of such metals in indudstrial or large scale production except for cement industry. This attributed to the variation in composition of characteristics of RDF (Dhir et al., 2018 ).  2.2 Recovered energy from RDF The use of alternative fuels maximizes the recovery of energy (Environmental Protection Agency, 2008 ). Life Cycle Assessment for the production of RDF and using it in cement kilns instead of conventional fossil fuel demonstrated environmental benefits such as reduction in acidification, GHG emissions, eutrophication, summer smog, landfill costs and carcinogenic risk potential. However, the importance of controlling air emissions when using RDF in cement production to ensure this benefit was highlighted (Silva et al., 2021 ). The Life Cycle Assessment methodology was also used to assess the environmental impacts of using alternative fuels (RDF, tire-derived fuel, biological sludge or a mixture of them) in partial replacement of traditional fuels (coal and petcoke) in the cement industry. It was concluded that the optimum scenario depends on RDF, while the least preferable one depends on biological sludge (Georgiopoulou and Lyberatos, 2018 ). Gasification technique has been applied to generate gaseous fuel from municipal solid waste.  Fig. (8)  illustrates a pilot plant gasifier that has been investigated for processing 7.1 tonnes/day of municipal RDF yielding 16.9 tonnes/day of syngas with a lower heating value of 4.6 MJ kg−1  (Ferreira et al., 2021 ). However, the RDF can be co-gasified with biochar and biomass to achieve synergistic effects and obtain a better gaseous fuel quality than conventional gasification (Rahma et al., 2021 ). Torrefaction, another technique, also can further improve fuel properties and valorize RDF (Stępień et al., 2019 ).   3 Alternative fuels and sustainable development goals The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 Goals ( Fig. 9 ) that almost all nations have adopted. The SDGs work as enablers that ensure that the world will achieve sustainable development. Determining the contribution of any industry will allow decision-makers and policymakers to overcome any possible trade-off impact with the SDGs. The analysis will also maximize the benefits of the related industry. CE holds promising benefits to assist in achieving the environmental and economic goals. According to the European cement industry, the partial replacement of fossil fuels with alternative fuels could significantly contribute to sustainable development via the reduction of greenhouse gases. Considering that the production of 1 ton of cement generates 0.83 tons of CO2 , this amount is derived from decarbonization, coal combustion, and electricity production in coal-based power plants. The utilization of wastes as AFs in the cement industry agrees with the general principles of waste management and the sustainable development goals set by the European Union and with the international policies on waste management, climate change, and energy efficiency (Cembureau, 2009 ). Also, it contributes to achieving the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development (2002) and the Millennium Development Goals (Georgiopoulou and Lyberatos, 2018 ).  Fig. 10  shows a map of the current situation of waste management worldwide. It can be seen that only a few countries in Europe have achieved the SDGs related to waste management efficiently while other countries faced some challenges, and the major challenge is the missing information. There is a lack of information such as the actual amount of generated wastes, their types, characteristics, points of discharges, the social, environmental impacts, local challenges in each country, legislative laws, stakeholders and government, public acceptance, and awareness, etc.  Table 2  shows the most related SDGs Targets based on the comprehensive research the RDF would contribute positively to most of the SDGs, directly or indirectly. 3.1 Sustainable development indicators A total of 54 of, in  Table 3 , the indicators proposed based on the above study and previous work (Ahmad et al., 2018; Bae and Smardon, 2011; Obaideen et al., 2022; Olabi et al., 2022; Ordonez-Ponce and Khare, 2021; Rigamonti et al., 2012 ). The indicators would help the interested party enhance the RDF's contribution toward the achievement of SDGs and CE. In addition, decrease the possible trade-off with the SDGs, improve data management, enhance the sustainability performance, lower the social impact, increase the stakeholder engagement, reduce the risk, and lower cost. The AFs are contributing in the sustainable development through the following goals:  3.2 SDG 1: No poverty Table   SDG 1: No poverty 1. Total duty paid.  2. The number of workers.  3. Average employees’ wage.  4. Number training programs per employee,  5. Paying decent prices to all suppliers, in particular micro, small and medium enterprises.  6. Lowering utility costs, such as water and electricity, for the low-income community.          A considerable percentage of the population of many developing countries is located under the poverty line. Unemployment was increased up and concentrated among the youth and women. The population growth rate pressurizes infrastructure and services in the developing country. These parameters create a big motivation and emphasize the requirement of generating economic growth to respond to the needs of the population and their expectations of improvements in wellbeing. Although the average retail prices of fossil fuels have substantial differences among countries, the richer countries have higher prices than the poorer ones, which are usually the countries producing and exporting the oil. The differences in prices across the world result from different taxes and subsidies for fuels. All countries have the same access to the same international markets prices for the various fuels, and then each country decides to impose taxes or subsidies. The Energy Intensive Industries (EII) consume a massive amount of fuels. For example, in the cement industry, energy is the biggest item in the production cost, typically represents a minimum of 30: 40% of the total cost. Following is a typical economic theme for a cost breakdown for a cement plant, with about 37.5 Euro/ ton clinker; Fuels 46.62%, fixed production cost 21.98%, Raw materials 18.25%, Electricity 12.14%, and Consumables 1.00%. Reducing the budget allocated for energy in the cement industry will guarantee the plants' sustainability, gain more profits and subsequently create more jobs, and increase the income of employees, technicians, and workers (El-Salamony et al., 2020 ).  3.3 SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing Table   SDG 3: Good health and well-being 1. Dust control measures.  2. Control the hazard.  3. Total healthcare benefits given to the employees.          Significant diseases like Cholera, typhoid, diarrhoea, and guinea worm were related to poor sanitation. Degradation of organic waste generates leachates that seepage into groundwater system and causes pollution; subsequently, a serious health problem could occur when the infected groundwater is consumed. Also, transmission of pathogenic diseases could happen by waste picker. Iyamu et al. (Iyamu et al., 2020 ) stated that hazardous materials such as polychlorinated biphenyls, asbestos fiber and others that identified in municipal solid waste caused chemical burns, nausea, paralysis and premature births to the workers that handled the waste materials carelessly in addition to the generation of methane gas (greenhouse gas) due to the degradation of the organic waste. Conversion of these wastes which is forecasted to reach 2.6 billion metric tonnes in 2030 into AFs will avoid all these problems and diseases (Yang et al., 2021b ). Recently, discrimination between landfill sites residential areas is difficult owning to increasingly growth of population. In addition to the improper management of MSW, dumping and open burning of MSW are strongly related to the human health (Pujara et al., 2019 ). Hence the potential of transforming these huge amounts of wastes into RDF will provide a healthy and clean environment and will generate a significant contribution to SDG 3 for human wellbeing. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic results in increasingly amount of wastes especially plastic one. The potential of transforming this kind of bio-medical waste into RDF has significant benefits such as controlling the risk of COVID-19 and other diseases spreading and reducing the load on landfilling of hazardous waste. Another advantage of utilizing biomedical waste to develop RDF is that unlike biomass, upon thermal processing of RDF particle recorded a unique swelling behavior ranged from 5.6 up to 10.3% due to the melting of plastic content in such wastes (Tripathi and Rao, 2022 ).  3.4 SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation Table   SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation 1. Water pollution and water reduction, wastewater management, and circular water strategies.  2. Nonportable water depletion.  3. The total reduction in water depletion.  4. Decrease the water footprint.          The most significant environmental impact of landfilling is the contamination of the groundwater by the generated leachate. Utilizing the wastes as AFs will reduce the amount of landfilled wastes and reduce any leakage of landfilling leachate that may contaminate groundwater. Everyone cubic meter of this leachate generates pollutants up to 152,000 g of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 11,600 g of suspended solids, 2500 g of organic nitrogen, 11,375 of Cl- , 225,000 g of hardness (CaCO3 ), 7200 g of Ca, 15,000 g of Mg, 3770 g of potassium, 8000 g of Na, 42,000 g of Fe, 1000 g of Zn and many other (Jaafarzadeh et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2005; Sormunen et al., 2008 ). Other problems like oxygen depletion and fish kills may occur if surface run-off contacts the landfilling cells (Scott et al., 2005 ). However, minimizing wastes discharged in landfills will reduce the volume of the leachate as possible and protect the groundwater from all of these contaminants.  3.5 SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy Table   SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy 1. Perform an energy balance study.  2. Degree of energy distribution.          The production of energy from wastes yields clean energy and minimizes the negative impacts on the environment. For example, ethanol generated from MSW can strongly minimize GHG emissions compared to traditional gasoline up to 84% (following EU RED calculation methodology), and by 156–231% reduction (according to the US EISA methodology) (Meng et al., 2021 ). To convert solid wastes to fuel, pre-treatment is necessary. The pre-treatment process includes drying, crushing, homogenization, and mixing with other fuels, including RDF (Frey et al., 2003 ). The combustion method depends on the waste particle size where a high combustion rate is achieved in the case of small size. The calorific value, another important parameter, depends on the moisture content. An example of the average composition of municipal waste is listed in  Table 4 . Besides law and legislation, these values define the treatment method of the waste. For example, waste that contains high moisture content shouldn’t be incinerated without pretreatment methods. RDF is the most economical one among various types of alternative fuels due to its high heating value (Papanikola et al., 2019 ). RDF could be wasted from different industries such as pulp, paper, cardboard, plastics, packaging, textile, etc. Generally, industrial and domestic wastes which represent AFs could be classified into two major groups (Zieri and Ismail, 2018 ): (1) liquid AFs that include; waste oil, solvents, animal fat, sewage sludge, and the like; and (2) solid AFs that include; pet coke, tires (chipped or complete), animal & bone meal, dried sewage sludge, scrap wood. AFs include many different types; the most popular materials to be used in cement kilns are; waste oils, shredded residues, waste plastics, waste tires, and sewage sludge. As a Liquid AFs example is solvents wastes. It could include alcohol (like methanol, ethanol, isopropanol), ketone (like acetone), or ester (like xylol, benzol, or toluol). Solvent wastes station includes pumps with filters and pipelines to burners in a clinker production line. The station base is better prepared with a leak-proof concrete surface with a collecting sump to avoid any unsafe hazardous. However, there are two main thermal processes; gasification and pyrolysis. The gasification temperature strongly affects the yield, quality, and energy content of the produced syngas. Compared to pyrolysis, gasification yielded 2.8 times increase at 1173 K and a 3.3 times increase in CO yield at 1073 K (Policella et al., 2019 ). On the other hand, hydrogen and energy yields are better with gasification than pyrolysis (Ahmed and Gupta, 2009 ). Tires wastes as a solid AFs example could be chipped to about 25 cm, or fed to pyro-processing in preheater as it is in complete, depending on kiln size and dosing system (Gray, 2004; Tsupari et al., 2013 ). Their heat content is in range of 6.5 Gcal/ t; it may contain water depending on the environment (Feraldi et al., 2013; Gray, 2004; Toktarova et al., 2020 ). Its contents mainly are carbon and steel. Conveying system terminal must include air locking system as in material injection point to the kiln or preheating system. The air locking is of high importance as it could result in failure of thermal profile and production capacities due to draft malfunctioning. Refuse-derived fuel is another solid AFs example, heat content range is varied from 2 to 5.5 Gcal/ t, could be classified into 3 groups: high calorific value (CV) up to 5.5 Gcal/ t, medium CV up to 3.8 Gcal/ t and low CV up to 2 Gcal/ t (International Finance Corporation, 2016; Nithikul, 2007; Syguła et al., 2021 ). RDF is characteristic with relatively high moisture than many other waste fuels; it could be up to 15%. Also, its chlorine content is relatively high, and could be up to 2% (International Finance Corporation, 2016; Nithikul, 2007; Syguła et al., 2021 ). Their chips size in range of 2.5–3.5 cm for optimized combustion in the main burner, and could be up to 15 cm while usage in calciner of preheating system (International Finance Corporation, 2016; Nithikul, 2007; Syguła et al., 2021 ). It can be concluded that utilizing various wastes as AFs will maximize the value of these wastes and generate affordable clean energy.  3.6 SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth Table   SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth 1. The total investment give to the clean technology research and development.  2. The proportion of housing offered to temporary employees.  3. Total jobs created.          With the growing in population which raised the energy demand, and the improvement in heavy industries worldwide, the situation was turned deeply to fuel shortage. The energy costs account from 30% to 40% of cement plant operating costs. Since AFs cost is cheaper than the fossil fuels, as it is not included quarrying, but go directly to stages of collect, process and transport, therefore the total fuel cost will be reduced. Thus, the fluctuating cost of fossil fuels, the high energy consumption and the negative environmental impacts have encouraged the substitution of fossil fuels with alternative ones in the cement production plants. Fuels from wastes such as industrial waste, scrap tires, RDF, waste oil, biomass, solvents, plastics, paper, and municipal solid waste, meat and bone meal have been investigated as alternative fuels (El-Salamony et al., 2020 ). The sustainability of AFR applications in the cement industry is expected with available potential benefits in the economic, social and technological sides, which increased the awareness and interest for the cement operators, waste operators, governmental partners, and other stakeholders (International Finance Corporation, 2016 ).  3.7 SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure Table   SDG 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure 1. Conducted social, economic, and environmental impact assessments.  2. Implement circular business concept.  3. Tracking and reporting climate impact.  4. The total value-added.          Initially, cement plants did not turn to the updated technology of maximizing the value and the power efficiency produced from the fuel in its multiple forms. Among these missed technologies are for example; the waste heat recovery (WHR) from the pyro-process stacks and the AFs usages in the cement industry. However, business wise were the motivation of the cement companies to not invest in WHR field, or in the AFs; the high initial cost, long-term payback, and low profit of these projects were the reasons to neglect it. AFs offer cost reduction by lowering the cost of wastes management, at the public governmental sector. The Co-processing (using AFRs aside to traditional fuels) in cement manufacturing process is considered an environmentally viable application of recovery selection, more preferred than landfilling and incineration, it saves landfill locations, especially with potentials for valuable investment. On the other hand, usage of AFs still face significant financial challenges; the waste materials are largely being disposed of in inefficient economically ways. As well as being a bottle of neck in magnifying the vital usage of fuels alternatives, and investment. The knowledge of processing and operating such systems, included trouble shooting still represent strong challenges to its typical applications. On the challenges side, AFs could be not suitable for some sort of cement types, as a result of its content of undesirable elements for color degrading of end product, such as iron element for the white cement, finally lead to exclude white cement plants from AFRs usage. Hopefully the non-polluted biomass wastes are almost the only choice for these plants. To find a suitable developed solution, gathering in work different stakeholders; from cement producers, to regulating authorities, waste producers, neighbours, employees, NGOs and the other stakeholders (El-Salamony et al., 2020 ).  3.8 SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities Table   SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities 1. Resource’s sustainability strategies.  2. Participation in microgrids.  3. Total generated waste.          There are changing institutional dynamics which could positively impact the AFRs business development in order to improve the waste management worldwide, charged with institutional mandates settings, developing adequate legislation, determine municipal and national responsibilities, transform waste from burden to an investment and an economic opportunity, support waste management providers with guidelines and capacity-building, coding-setting for composting facilities and new landfills, enlarge opportunities of investment in the sector, and determine-aids for needed budgets and methods of funding. On the other side of challenges, smart management of the resources of fuels beside minimizing subsidies for industrial section are the common challenges toward healthy economic (Griffin et al., 2016 ). There are three key aspects in smart waste management: process efficiency, development and marketing. Still, the waste international management handling processes could be traditional and not smart enough. The challenge still to what extent of the green, CO2  emission, cycling, and smart degrees regarding the application used, all accompanied by energy and information flow (Xu et al., 2015 ). Waste management in modern societies is facing challenge of focusing on the regulatory requirements governing the disposal of the wastes as its rule of thumb for emerging economies. At the end, planning of waste management systems should be put in consider during the design of new cities or communities. Recycling of the wastes inside the location that these wastes were generated will provide a green and modern lifestyle. This is attributed to that transferring of wastes for long distance could affect negatively the environment, in case of leakage, or improper storage.  3.9 SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production (circular economy) Table   SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production 1. Track down all types of short-term and long-term contamination.  2. Total resources and materials required.  3. Total waste treated.          One the main enabler to achieve the SDG 12 is the circular economy. Whereby circular economy practices all about decoupling economic activity from resource use and associated environmental and social impacts, which is heart of the of this goal (Agostini et al., 2021; Rodriguez-Anton et al., 2019 ). The main target of the circular economy is to return materials/energy to the nature after a useful cycle and this is the main difference between linear and circular economy. For example, the impact of biofuel production in Brazil to improve the national economy yields reduction in the amazon rain forest, a rise in sea level, and a reduction in spaces of the habitable land area (Ferrante and Fearnside, 2020 ). In this linear model, solid wastes are only dumbed or landfill causing pollution where the economic system is conflict with the parent system and results only economic growth in contrast to circular economy, where wastes are utilized to improve the economy and protect the ecosystem via releasing back to biosphere helping to biodiversity and biomass growth which supports ecosystem. The implementation of circular economy in the fuel sectors is great because around 75% of the energy production is based on non-renewable sources (Korhonen et al., 2018 ), which means that alternative fuels will make a big difference in the economy and environment. The goal is to achieve the highest natural resources values. In this vision, CE is multidisplinary sustainable management system. To achieve the main goals of CE, different organization should collaborate to facilitate the planning, design and management in addition to the evaluation of the results. Although many investigations on the thermochemical conversion and commercial of biofuels have been carried out, they still at an early stage. Process optimization on the industrial level is still required. Enhancing the calorific values of the alternative fuels is important to ensure scaling up; reduction of the cost of thermochemical conversion should be acceptable and reasonable. To ensure sustainability criteria, the focus in future should be in combining economic aspects with ecological and social sustainability. The environmental profile of electricity production from RDF was assessed by comparing two different plants for RDF production and combustion (Longo et al., 2020 ). The first one produce RDF in a direct flow treatment plant and the other one is produce the RDF in a unique flow treatment plant and a co-generator was used to produce the electricity. Comparing the plants, it is impossible to confirm the option that yields the lowest impacts.  Fig. 11  presents an overview of the life cycle assessment of the RDF. However, cogeneration process and the avoided burdens due to the valorization of ferrous metals and dry fractions during RDF production can minimize most of the environmental impacts. Although the electricity from RDF caused negative environmental impact, it performs better than electricity generated from the grid or photovoltaic source for resource depletion, an effect category of increasing significance in the framework of circular economy. The role of the RDF in circular economy have been elaborated in details in the Section 3 . A Cement plant in Georgia, U.S.A, with TSR over 93% as an average on monthly basis, with 100% depending on AFs for 24 hrs, with biomass energy consumption with almost 90,000 ton, includes penult shell and wood sawdust in combination with tires as an effective specific fuel mix (International Finance Corporation, 2016 ). In 2014, the clean development mechanism (CDM) project of another plant in Egypt was approved from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change a project included emissions reduction through partial substitution of fossil fuels with renewable plantation biomass and biomass residues.  Fig. (12)  demonstrates the role of the RDF within the circular economy based on several reported studies (Hemidat et al., 2019; Kristanto and Rachmansyah, 2020; Yang et al., 2021a ). HEIDELBERG Cement international group reported in its sustainability programme 2020 targeting of using 30% AFs. It’s well on track with its improvements that reported at yearly SD reports. Best example is plant in Kunda, Estonia, that was able to reach with TSR more than 45% in 2015. The highest TSR for the whole group in 2015 was achieved at Lengfurt plant in Germany, where 90% of the coal were replaced with AFs (No and Fasanvej, 2015 ). Major of the cement key players are owned by international groups like LafargeHolcim, Heidelberg cement group, CEMEX, VICAT, TITAN and Cementir Holding. These international companies have their business and environmental agenda and worldwide commitments of TSR targets with wide-ranging experience in the use of AFs. Some cement plants have reached with AFs to 100% TSR of their conventional fuel stream with sound production accompanied by the quality in standards (International Finance Corporation, 2016 ).  3.10 SDG 13: Climate action Table   SDG 13: Climate action 1. Reporting and tracking all types of pollution.  2. Rate of supply chain emissions.  3. The percentage of projects located in areas with emission reduction potential.  4. The proportion of energies employed.  5. Total of research directed toward climate change.          The processes of climate and ecosystem change at high risk, as the global warming is induced mainly by CO2  emissions. It would require that cumulative CO2  emissions should remain < 3650 Gt CO2  (1000 GtC), but over half this value has already been generated by the year 2011. The implementation of AFs instead of fossil ones is highly recommended to minimize these emissions and reducing fossil fuel dependency. Cement manufacturing process has been a cause for concern because it creates severe pollution as measured by CO2 , NOx  and SOx  emissions, cement industry, also it accounts for 5% of the world’s CO2  emissions. The basic cause is the use of limestone as a raw material and fossil fuel coal as a fuel, which together contribute about 0.8 tons of CO2  emissions per ton of clinker (Deolalkar et al., 2015 ). The worldwide content of the fossil fuels are in decreasing, by extracting and burning it in open cycle, as its burning products are not recycled. Thus the AFs would be beneficial from the ecological point of view. The cement industry’ modernized rotary kilns have an ecological sound condition like the high temperature, gas stream’ high speed and the long particle-storage period, which guarantee usages of AFs would be ecologically safe (Mokrzycki et al., 2003 ) and environmentally sustained. Green cement plant is designed to take care with three fundamentals; maximum production, AFs facilities and WHR facilities. AFs is offering effective solution for the rounded municipalities and industrial companies’ wastes, and reducing landfilled or dumped wastes, as it will be processed and being used in such energy generation. Using wastes for energy supply reduces pollution resulted from disposal of waste and lowering the GHGs emissions through reduction combustion of the fossil fuels, especially the coal, as a major viable fossil fuel currently been used in developing countries. Green cement plant is a given term for the cement plant that was designed to take care about the aspects of saving the environment, included natural resources and GHGs emissions. The international experiences of typical applications are available. It’s important to note that several cement operators in developing countries belong to international conglomerates. Therefore, a lot of them are already participated with wide targets in AFR substitution, as well as GHGs emission reduction plans. Their commitments are coming spontaneously from belonging to World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD)’s Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) (Xu et al., 2015 ). Numerous investigations have been on focus on researching innovative and green technologies and improving the existing technologies to realize better RDF quality and minimizing or/and control its emissions. It was found that some countries that replaced coal by refuse-derived fuel, recorded reduction in CO2  emission by 40% and minimization the amount MSW that being sent to landfill by more than 50% (Yang et al., 2021b ). Also RDF burning has negative impacts on acidification (SO2 , NOx emitted from combustion of fuel and HCl and HF emitted as a consequence of electricity production), formation of photochemical ozone (NOx, CH4 , and non-CH4  volatile organic compounds), and global warming (CO2  and CH4  emissions), however, its impacts is much lower than traditional fuel (Grzesik and Malinowski, 2016 ). In a step toward achieving zero-waste cities, RDF has been developed from municipal and industrial wastes resulting in decreasing in the emissions of NO and SO2  by 26% and 63% (Li et al., 2021 ).  3.11 SDG 14: Life below Water Table   SDG 14: Life below water 1. Tracking and reporting all water-related pollution.  2. Measuring the marine ecotoxicity.          Dumping waste generate leachates which negatively impact the groundwater, subsequently yield high-risk health hazards to consumers of bore water. Also, the continuous piling of the components of electronic waste on roadsides and off-storage sites results in contamination of natural water bodies when flooded by rainfall (Olabode and Lawrence, 2014 ).  3.12 SDG 15: Life on land Table   SDG 15: Life on land 1. Quantifying biodiversity the impact.  2. Effective methane yield.  3. Conducts an extensive life cycle assessment to measure all the environment impact.          Usage of wastes as fuel sources eliminate the cost and land needed for disposal or landfilling. In addition to minimize the problems of secondary pollution in case of uncontrolled disposal, including soil contamination by heavy metals and pathogens since there will be no need for transportation for long distance to be landfilled. Public acceptance plays an important role in waste management, where transformation of waste into fuel will minimize bad odor and insects of dumps, bioaerosol emissions of composting process (Cheng and Hu, 2010 ). The heavy metals that potentially generated from household dust, body-care products, inks, paints and pesticides could accumulate in the untreated solid waste, which can potentially change the chemical composition of soil and consequently, destruct the plant life and cause secondary pollution (Li’ao et al., 2009 ).  3.13 SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals Table   SDG 17: Partnerships to achieve the goal 1. SDGs’ integration in business policies.  2. Cooperation with the various organizations.          The new reality of removing domestic fuel subsidies applied on the industrial sector (Griffin et al., 2016 ), especially the high intensive like cement manufacturing, has provoked strong interest for the cement producers in usage of AFs than the fossils to lower the production cost. The factors of sustainability could be entitled in following: Diversifying of AFs; competitiveness and attractiveness become two hot new items for cement producers. That will be investigated among the AFs, depend on the suitability, and maximum benefits could be winning. Plentiful resources for wastes, which fulfill the cement industrial requirements such as; RDF from MSW, dried sewage sludge from waste water treatment plants, agricultural wastes, and tired derived fuels from scrap tires. It may also be advisable - but need more research and data mining to find out the viability and availability of business opportunities for other AFs, including but not limited to; industrial wastes, spent oils, spent solvents and polluted soil (International Finance Corporation, 2016 ). International interests about the AFs not only depend on the environmental issues, but surely on the financial gains. For example, Holcim group significantly widen the cement production to 120%, but with only limited increasing in the energy consumption, that was up to 45% only. Hence, since it was started to make AFs in charge in its businesses, the company’s expansion rests on only using 25% of the conventional fuel (International Finance Corporation, 2016 ). Sustainability of AFR applications in cement industry is expected with available potential benefits in the economic, social and technological sides, which increased the awareness and interest for the cement operators, waste operators, governmental partners and all aside to other stakeholders (International Finance Corporation, 2016 ). International trend of encouraging; the International Financial Corporation – International organization headquartered in Washington D.C., US, with 184 member countries, and is a member of the World Bank has launched a detailed report about wastes viability as an option for “cement producers” as an “AFs”(Biermann et al., 2019; Li’ao et al., 2009 ). Paris agreement launched at 2015, in which 200 countries and plenty of executive persons committed to reducing carbon emissions (Griggs et al., 2013 ). Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (United Nations Environment Programme, 1989 ), launched at 1989 and came into force in 1992, with 181 international parties as of 2014, and 14 centers. The convention obliges its parties that such wastes are managed and disposed in an environmentally sound manner and to be closed as possible to their place of generation, as well as to be prevented or minimized the generation.   4 Conclusion and outlook Cement is one of the basics of building materials and its products worldwide in continuously increasing with international credited ranking. It’s not only that fuel is considered one of the major cost items for cement manufacturing but also wastes are highly considered big expenditures item for governmental authorities. Fuel substitution with MSW as AFs will back with economic benefits on the private sector and governmental organizations. And it would be an infinite generation resource of fuels, with friendly environmental treatment for the potential environmental hazards of wastes. This work elaborates on the role of the RDF in the achievement of the SDGs and the RDF contribution to the circular economy. Analysis shows that the RDF contributes to most of the SDGs, either directly or indirectly. The significant contribution came from its ability in providing a green source of energy and reducing materials waste. In the circular economy, the major contribution of RDF came from its ability in reusing waste materials. Furthermore, a total of 54 indicators were proposed to direct the stakeholder to enhance the RDF contribution into the SDGs and reduce the possible the trade-off. Furthermore, the work suggested a set of indictors that could be utilized by different stakeholder to enhance the contribution of the RDF into the SDGs. Based on the previously mentioned collected data, it’s clear that the AFs are more preferable than fossil fuels with much more efficient environmental, financial, technical and management approaches. This could lead eventually to achieve the SDGs and play a significant role in moving toward the circular economy. However, better communication is still recommended to a link between producers and users of AFs and with the most modern technology of shredding, sensing, and transporting to save effort, time and money. Further studies are still required to assess the database of different types of municipal wastes which may help to refine and develop the processes of gathering, sorting, and processing of wastes. It would be much more likely to consider those living in developing countries by offering and motivating them with the financial possible gains.
