                  World Natural Heritage sites are globally significant natural and cultural landscapes, serve as crucial benchmarks of human efforts in conservation and contribute to broader sustainable development agendas. This study aims to investigate the multifaceted relationship between World Natural Heritage conservation and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) regarding public perception. We focus on the Guilin Karst region and explore the viewpoints of 520 local residents living around the Guilin World Natural Heritage site. The findings demonstrate that most residents deeply understand and care about preserving heritage, express their satisfaction with it, and are willing to increase taxes to support heritage conservation. Additionally, they perceive the multifaceted influence of natural heritage site conservation on the SDGs. Living closer to the Guilin Karst region has a stronger impact on long-term residents’ conservation and sustainability perception. Incorporating the viewpoints of the local community into World Natural Heritage conservation and sustainable development, the study fosters a more inclusive and participatory approach towards managing and safeguarding our shared natural heritage.

This study aims to investigate the multifaceted relationship between World Natural Heritage conservation and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) regarding public perception. We focus on the Guilin Karst region and explore the viewpoints of 520 local residents living around the Guilin World Natural Heritage site. The findings demonstrate that most residents deeply understand and care about preserving heritage, express their satisfaction with it, and are willing to increase taxes to support heritage conservation. Additionally, they perceive the multifaceted influence of natural heritage site conservation on the SDGs. Living closer to the Guilin Karst region has a stronger impact on long-term residents’ conservation and sustainability perception. Incorporating the viewpoints of the local community into World Natural Heritage conservation and sustainable development, the study fosters a more inclusive and participatory approach towards managing and safeguarding our shared natural heritage.

World Heritage conservation plays a crucial role in achieving sustainable development goals, such as poverty reduction, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion. Local sustainable development also contributes to the long-term conservation and management of heritage resources. In November 2015, State Parties to the World Heritage Convention approved a resolution adopting a policy that integrated sustainable development into World Heritage conservation (Liljeblad and Oo, 2020 ). The sustainability of heritage involves the sustainability of the heritage itself and its contributions to the sustainable development of the local population. This also reflects the institutionalization of sustainability in the domain of heritage conservation (Min et al., 2011 ). Since the 2000s, many international organizations such as UNESCO and IUCN have promoted the sustainable management of natural heritage sites through guidelines and best practices (Andreu-Boussut et al., 2016 ). In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by 193 United Nation member states, heritage conservation was clearly described in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11.4: “strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage” (UN, 2015 ). In many countries, natural heritage conservation was included their legal and administrative systems (He et al., 2023a ; Ravbar and Šebela, 2015 ). The natural heritage conservation may directly contribute to enriching the living environment for present and future generations. It also serves as a significant asset for economic development by attracting investment and ensuring the provision of green, local, and stable employment opportunities. This enables it to continue benefiting humanity. In the developing countries, heritage can thus be utilized, making tourism a primary source of income (Xiao et al., 2018 ). Heritage conservation have the potential to make positive contributions to sustainable development (Hribar et al., 2015 ). Numerous UNESCO World Heritage sites have integrated heritage conservation into sustainable development, such as the Baroque Churches of the Philippines, the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces of China, and the Medina of Fez in Morocco (Labadi et al., 2020; Labadi et al., 2021 ). The relationship between heritage conservation and sustainable development exhibits a multifaceted and sometimes even contradictory interaction (Labadi, 2017 ). The renown of World Heritage sites has propelled the rapid growth of the local tourism industry (Chen et al., 2023 ) and caused negative effects on the environments of these sites(Hosseini et al., 2021 ). Karst regions, which constitute approximately 10%–15% of the terrestrial land area, accommodate approximately 16.5% of the global population (Goldscheider et al., 2020 ) and have exceptional economic, social, ecological, scientific and educational functions (Ravbar and Šebela, 2015 ). As of January 2022, a total of 76 karst landscapes have been inscribed as World Heritage sites, totaling 841,422 km2  (Gunn, 2022 ; He et al., 2023b ). Among them, the Guilin Karst was listed as a WHS in 2014 due to its unique landscape. Additionally, it has attracted many domestic and foreign tourists. The number of tourists surged from 38.71 million visitors to 138.33 million by the end of 2019 (Guilin Bureau of Statistics, 2015 ; Guilin Bureau of Statistics, 2020 ). This rapid surge in tourism yielded a dual effect. On the one hand, it drove economic prosperity within local communities and spurred infrastructural enhancements (Nian et al., 2022 ; Wang, 2016 ). On the other hand, due to its vulnerability, the Guilin Karst ecological integrity faces severe threats (He et al., 2021 ; Viles, 2003 ) such as karst rocky desertification, soil erosion, landscape degradation, environmental pollution, and loss of biodiversity (Gunn, 2004 ; Liu et al., 1987 ; Monro et al., 2018 ; Valjavec et al., 2018 ; Wen et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). Heritage as attraction of sustainability, its adaptive management presents the biggest challenges facing nature conservation and local development. The sustainability of heritage and the sustainable development of local communities need be coordinated, which require the collaborative efforts and coordination of multiple stakeholders (Jang and Mennis, 2021 ; Roque et al., 2024 ). The local residents serving as human capital are crucial for the sustainable conservation and management of heritage (Su et al., 2018 ; Bajec and Kranjc, 2022 ). Their knowledge and experience may be a significant asset in the community-environment-development nexus (Aas et al., 2005 ). In many developing countries, however, this role of resident remains underappreciated (He et al., 2023a,b ). Consequently, there is limited research examining the multifaceted relationship between heritage conservation from the perspective of residents and sustainable development. Such research processes often involve knowledge deemed unscientific or subjective. Yet, life adheres to numerous subjective standards and values, justifying their consideration when exploring heritage issues in reality (Fuller et al., 2015 ). Therefore, this study focuses on the renowned Guilin Karst World Natural Heritage site, located in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. The research analyzed and explored the multifaceted relationship between the conservation of Guilin's World Heritage site and the SDGs through residents' perception. Public participation in local conservation activities and their access to conservation-related decision-making were not our concern. And the primary method used is questionnaires. The specific objectives of this study are 1) to investigate local residents' perception towards the conservation of natural heritage sites, 2) to assess the multifaceted relationship between heritage conservation and sustainable development, and 3) to analyze key factors that influence residents' perception of this multifaceted relationship. The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows. Section 2  describes the methodology, focusing on study area, analytical framework, the design of the research questions and survey. Section 3  presents the results. Section 4  and Section 5  present the discussion and the conclusion.  2 Methodology 2.1 Study area Guilin (109°36′50″-111°29′30″E, 24°15′23″-26°23′30″N) is located in the northeastern region of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, and has a subtropical monsoon climate (Fig. 1  ). At the end of 2022, the total population of Guilin was 4.95 million, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of 243.5 billion CNY (about 33.3 billion US$) (Guilin Bureau of Statistics, 2023 ). The number of international and domestic tourists was 107 million and total tourism consumption was 127.8 billion RMB (17.5 billion US$), which shows the importance of tourism to the local economy. The Guilin Karst covers a total area of 253.84 km2  with an additional buffer zone covering 446.8 km2 . This karst landscape comprises the Li River Canyon Peaks Area and the Grapevine Peaks Area. Notably, at the 38th General Assembly held on June 23, 2014, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee announced that Guilin in Guangxi, Huanjiang in Guangxi, Jinfo Mountain in Chongqing, and Shiping in Guizhou were inscribed as extensions of the Southern China Karst during the second phase of the World Heritage List.  2.2 Data collection and analysis The data were collected by expert interview and questionnaire survey. Three experts in local institute and universities were interviewed to identify SDGs relevant to and needing implementation in the karst regions. A survey was conducted through our initially designed questionnaire. Two stages' pre-test of the draft questionnaire was implemented through face-to-face interviews with five experts and twelve local residents in September and October 2021. The questionnaire finally consisted of three sections. The first section gathered information about the respondents' personal characteristics, including gender, age, education level, and other relevant information. The second section focused on the residents’ perception towards the conservation of natural heritage sites and whether they are negative or positive. The third section emphasized the multifaceted relationship between heritage conservation and SDGs. In this section, participants were asked to assess the impact, contribution, challenges, and potential for the realization of SDGs through the conservation of natural heritage sites. With the exception of the first section, a Likert scale methodology was employed in the remaining sections. The score ranged from 1 to 5, which is interpreted from the lowest level (1) to the highest level (5). The detailed information of the questionnaire can be found in the supplementary materials (Appendix A ). The survey was conducted online between November and December 2021. The samples encompassed the population in core and buffer zones of WHSs, including regions such as Xing'an County, Lingchuan County, Xingping and Yangdi in Yangshuo County, Caoping Township in Yanshan District and the city center of Guilin. Considering familiarity with local situations and the degree of social and demographic heterogeneity of this population, the sample was representative. By a professional survey platform, the questionnaires were randomly distributed to residents aged 15 years or older to ensure questionnaire response accuracy. To ensure the quality of questionnaire data, it is typically necessary to exclude incomplete questionnaires, as well as individuals whose responses are identical or have been completed within a short time frame. A total of 610 questionnaires were distributed, and 520 valid questionnaires were collected after excluding invalid responses. The validity rate was 85%. The respondent IDs, personal information, and question scores were recorded in an Excel file. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 27 software. Descriptive statistical analysis, Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA), and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the survey data. Differences among samples in terms of the percentage, mean, and standard deviation (SD) were analyzed through the descriptive statistical analysis. The Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA and one-way ANOVA were applied to determine the statistically significant differences between three or more groups. We set the level of statistical significance at P  < 0.05 (95% confidence interval).  2.3 Analytical framework World Heritage offers local stakeholders employment opportunities, attracts investment, and fosters economic development. Consequently, stakeholders may commit to maintaining the integrity of heritage sites. Moreover, the integrity of these sites can further enhance local development. This creates a community-environment-development nexus. While some heritage sites have integrated protection into their sustainable development agendas, the influence, contributions, challenges, and possibilities of heritage protection in achieving sustainable development goals remain largely unknown. Some scholars demonstrate that residents' awareness of heritage value plays a crucial role in their sense of responsibility towards its protection (Fang et al., 2021 ; Liljeblad and Oo, 2020 ). So, how do residents, as key stakeholders, perceive heritage protection? What are their views on the influence, contributions, challenges, and possibilities of heritage protection in achieving sustainable development goals? How do respondents’ demographic characteristics influence their perception? A specific analytical framework was developed to answer the above questions by investigating the residents of the Guilin Karst heritage site (Fig. 2  ). Here, influence refers to the role of heritage conservation in achieving local SDGs. Contributions denote the tangible and intangible benefits that heritage preservation brings to these goals. Challenges represent the obstacles or difficulties encountered to achieve sustainable development goals by heritage preservation. Possibilities indicate the potential opportunities that heritage preservation offers for promoting the realization of these goals. In such a framework, it is important to stress that public perceptions do not directly explain the achievement of SDGs. However, this human-centered approach may lead to a better understanding of the community-environment-development nexus and enhance local communities’ adaptive management of heritage sites (Hribar et al., 2015 ). The findings can indirectly infer that heritage conservation plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable development. They also offer valuable evidence to assist decision-makers in crafting more effective and inclusive policies for heritage protection. Additionally, it may facilitate a deeper understanding among heritage managers regarding the involvement of residents in heritage preservation, thereby ensuring the sustainable development of heritage sites and contributing to the attainment of local sustainable development goals.   3 Results 3.1 Demographic characteristics of respondents The demographic characteristics analysis (Table 1  ) of the 520 respondents revealed that 260 individuals (50%) were male and 260 individuals (50%) were female, which closely aligned with the gender distribution in the survey region (51.7% male and 48.3% female) (Guilin Bureau of Statistics, 2022 ). The majority of respondents fell into the age groups of 21–30 years and 31–40 years, accounting for 222 individuals (42.7%) and 230 individuals (44.2%), respectively. Nearly half of the respondents (45%) had resided near the heritage site area for over 20 years. In terms of education, 5.2% were middle school graduates, 91 (17.5%) were high school graduates, 379 (72.0%) had completed college or university, and 23 (3.9%) were master's graduates. Furthermore, 47.1% of the respondents had a monthly income ranging from 6000 to 9999 CNY (821–1369 US$). Over 41.3% of the respondents were employed in the business sector, 20.2% were self-employed, and 7.7% were farmers or fishermen. Other respondents came from government agencies, research institutes, universities, and nongovernmental organizations.  3.2 Local residents’ perception towards Guilin Karst conservation This study primarily investigated the respondents’ 1) level of knowledge about the natural heritage site, 2) level of concern about Guilin Karst conservation, 3) satisfaction with heritage conservation and 4) support for heritage site conservation as stakeholders. The results (Fig. 3  ) indicated that local residents had a clear understanding of heritage conservation and held a positive perception towards it. The majority of local respondents had a high (42.1%) or very high (22.5%) understanding of the basic information about the World Heritage site, and only a small proportion of the respondents (3.8% and 0.6%) had limited or no knowledge about it. Over half of the residents (77.5%) were actively concerned about the conservation of the Guilin Karst. Additionally, most residents were satisfied (44%) or very satisfied (32.5%) with the protection of the Guilin Karst. In terms of taking action to support the conservation of WHS  resources, 49.2% of respondents were moderately proactive and 30% were highly proactive.  3.3 Multifaceted relationship between WHS conservation and SDGs Through field investigations and local expert interviews, the research identified 23 specific objectives pertaining to the 13 SDGs in the context of the Guilin Karst. The participants were asked about the multifaceted relationship between World Natural Heritage conservation (WNHC) and local SDGs. Each target in each goal was given a score based on the public assessment (Fig. 4  ). The participants rated these SDG preselected targets in response to the following questions: Q1 “How do you rate the influence of WNHC on achieving the local SDGs?“, Q2 “How do you rate the contribution of WNHC to local SDGs?“, Q3 “How do you rate the challenge in WNHC to achieve local SDGs”, and Q4 “How do you rate the possibility in WNHC to achieve the local SDGs?” Regarding the influence of karst landscape conservation on local SDGs (Fig. 4a ), 85.77%–90.38% of the respondents marked scores between 3 and 5, with the lowest percentage at 85.77% (SDG 1.4) and the highest at 90.38% (SDG 15.1 and SDG 15.3). Approximately 23.1%–28.3% of respondents rated specific targets with a score of 5, 33.5%–44.2% gave a score of 4, and 19.40%–28.1% gave a score of 3. Regarding the contribution of karst landscape conservation to local SDGs (Fig. 4b ), the majority of respondents gave scores between 3 and 5, with the lowest percentage at 84.42% (SDG 1.4) and the highest at 91.92% (SDG 12.2). Overall, approximately 21.5%–29.4% of respondents rated specific targets with a score of 5, 33.5%–43.3% gave a score of 4, and 19.40%–27.50% gave a score of 3. During the survey, the importance of challenges was ranked (Fig. 4c ). The results showed that 83.65%–90.19% of respondents chose scores between 3 and 5. Among them, SDG 1.4 had the lowest ranking, while SDG 6.6 had the highest ranking. Approximately 21.54%–27.88% of respondents selected a score of 5, 35.77%–42.50% chose a score of 4, and 21.15%–27.69% selected a score of 3. Additionally, rankings were provided for the possibility of achieving the SDGs (Fig. 4d ). The results showed that 82.50%–90.19% of respondents chose scores between 3 and 5. SDG 1.4 had the lowest ranking, while SDG 6.3 and SDG 2.A had the highest rankings. Approximately 21.54%–26.35% of respondents selected a score of 5, 35.96%–44.23% chose a score of 4, and 19.62%–27.5% selected a score of 3. The impact of the WNHC on local SDGs was assessed (Table 2  ), with average scores ranging from 3.68 to 3.83 (out of 5) and standard deviations ranging from 0.967 to 1.158. The residents rated SDG15.5 ″Reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity” highest (M = 3.83), followed by SDG15.1 ″Ensure the sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services” (M = 3.81). The lowest score was given to SDG4.7 ″Acquire the knowledge and skills to promote sustainable development” (M = 3.68). Regarding the contribution of the WNHC to local SDGs, the average scores ranged from 3.65 to 3.86 (out of 5), with standard deviations ranging from 0.950 to 1.130. The residents gave the highest rating to SDG12.2 ″Achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources” (M = 3.83), while the lowest score was given to SDG3.9 ″Reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and pollution” (M = 3.68). Additionally, the challenges faced by the WNHC in achieving local SDGs were assessed, with average scores ranging from 3.64 to 3.84 and standard deviations ranging from 0.997 to 1.118. The highest rating was given to SDG6.6 ″Protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountain, wetland, forest” (M = 3.84). The lowest average score (M = 3.64) was for SDG1.4 ″Equal rights to access … inheritance, natural resources”. In terms of the potential for the WNHC to contribute to achieving local sustainable development goals, the average scores ranged from 3.66 to 3.79 (out of 5), with standard deviations ranging from 0.977 to 1.129. The residents rated SDG6.3 ″Improve water quality” highest. The lowest score was given to SDG4.7 ″Acquire the knowledge and skills to promote sustainable development” (M = 3.66).  3.4 Key factors that affect the residents’ perception The Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA and one-way ANOVA were conducted to analyze the differences between seven demographic indicators. This analysis was performed in relation to the multifaceted relationships between karst conservation and 23 specific targets of sustainable development among the 13 categories. The results revealed (Fig. 5 ) that there were no significant differences among respondents' gender in terms of the influence, contribution, and possibility of achieving local SDGs. However, the analysis revealed significant differences between males and females in facing challenges related to achieving local SDGs for SDG11.4 (P  < 0.05) and SDG15.3 (P  < 0.05). Furthermore, the key factors that influenced various aspects of achieving local SDGs showed remarkably consistent results. The primary influencing factors were the distance of respondents' residence from the heritage site and the length of their residency in the area. This result indicated that respondents’ geographical location and the length of residency significantly influenced their perception of attaining the sustainable development goals. Age was thought to be another key factor in facing challenges related to achieving local SDGs. In summary, the analysis revealed significant disparities in the influence, contribution, possibilities, and challenges related to local SDGs based on the respondents' residence, duration of local residence, and age. Specifically, concerning the influence aspect, significant disparities were observed based on the respondents' residence for 18 out of the 23 targets (P  < 0.01). Only 3 targets showed no significant differences. The duration of local residence demonstrated a substantial influence on 15 out of the 23 targets (P  < 0.01). Additionally, 6 targets exhibited significant differences (P  < 0.05). Only 2 targets showed no significant differences. Regarding the contributions towards achieving local SDGs, substantial differences were observed based on the respondents' residence for 17 out of the 23 targets (P  < 0.01). Only 3 targets showed no significant differences. Similarly, the duration of local residence displayed a significant impact on 17 targets (P  < 0.01), 3 targets exhibited significant differences (P  < 0.05), and 3 targets showed no significant differences. Concerning the possibility aspect, there were highly significant differences (P  < 0.01) in 20 out of 23 targets for the respondents' residence, with 3 targets showing significant differences (P  < 0.05). Similarly, the respondents' length of residency showed highly significant differences (P  < 0.01) in 13 out of 23 targets, with 5 targets showing significant differences (P  < 0.05) and only 5 targets showing no significant differences. Regarding the challenges in achieving local SDGs, the respondents’ residences exhibited highly significant differences (P  < 0.01) in 18 targets, and 4 targets showed substantial differences. Only SDG13 showed no significant differences. The length of residency exhibited highly significant differences (P  < 0.01) in 20 out of 23 targets. Additionally, a significant difference (P  < 0.05) was observed with SDG11.A. No significant differences were found with SDG6.6 and SDG13. Furthermore, age was a significant variable in challenges related to achieving SDGs. Highly significant differences (P  < 0.01) were observed for 18 targets. Significant differences (P  < 0.05) were observed for 7 targets.   4 Discussion 4.1 Public perception on WHS conservation Among the surveyed residents, more than 60% demonstrated a clear awareness of the Guilin Karst heritage, and two-thirds were concerned about it. Additionally, nearly 80% of interviewees actively participated in and supported heritage conservation efforts (Fig. 3 ). This result provides a solid basis for the conservation of World Heritage properties. Living in karst natural heritage areas has both advantages and disadvantages for local residents (Nestorová et al., 2020 ). For example, there is potential to involve tourism based on the natural and cultural value of the heritage, which can stimulate local economic growth (Chen et al., 2023 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). However, as heritage tourism grows, the threats to these areas also increase (He et al., 2023a,b ). Human presence alters karst landscapes, leading to landscape degradation. Unlike other heritage sites, karst landscapes take a very long time to recover once damaged (Cao et al., 2015 ). Residents' awareness and actions in heritage protection can effectively support the sustainable development of these sites. Recent research increasingly focuses on the role of destination residents, as they have broader interaction with the heritage and a greater impact on the environment (Fang et al., 2021 ). Residents' recognition of the heritage value is crucial in fostering a sense of responsibility for its protection. In some developing countries, however, local residents are not given sufficient attention. For instance, in the management of Sri Ksetra's World Heritage Site, Pyu, local residents have been marginalized. They have not received the attention and support they deserve, contrary to the objectives of the World Heritage Committee, which aims to promote local community involvement and support for sustainable conservation (Liljeblad and Oo, 2020 ).  4.2 World heritage conservation and sustainable development The relationships between heritage conservation and sustainable development are multifaceted (Fig. 4 ). Among the surveyed residents, there were perception that karst heritage preservation had an influence on and contributed to sustainable development, particularly for SDG15.1 and SDG15.3. They also acknowledged that attaining sustainable development was not without challenges. The achievement of SDG6.6 in karst heritage sites poses greater challenges due to the unique geological environment of karst regions as well as issues of balancing interests and resource allocation among different stakeholders (Wang et al., 2019 ), which makes achieving ecological goals related to water restoration difficult. This conclusion is consistent with the reality on the ground (Qin et al., 2020 ). Despite facing challenges, the surveyed residents believed in the feasibility of achieving SDG6.3, improving water quality. However, the proactive engagement of residents is pivotal in achieving the sustainable development goals. Karst heritage management requires collaboration across various sectors, such as international organizations and local governments, businesses, experts, and local communities, to achieve sustainable development in the environmental, economic, and cultural dimensions (Labadi et al., 2021 ). Nonetheless, many karst heritage sites grapple with unclear managerial roles across sectors and minimal stakeholder engagement, hindering the implementation of interdisciplinary methods. In China, government-led top-down decision-making processes are more prevalent for karst heritage landscape preservation (He et al., 2023a ). Looking ahead, the aim is to form a virtuous the community-environment-development nexus. We should not only gauge the effectiveness of karst landscape conservation but also ensure that conservation strategies address cross-community and cross-departmental needs, thus advancing the achievement of sustainable development goals.  4.3 The importance of demographic factors in achieving local SDGs This research, set against the backdrop of Guilin karst landscapes, acknowledges the intimate connection between residents and their environment. The duration of residents' habitation and their proximity to these unique landscapes are factors that intricately shape their understanding and positive evaluations of the interaction between karst heritage and sustainable development (Fig. 5  ). This connection permeates cultural and historical dimensions. Based on demographic characteristics such as residence, duration of local residence, and age, the significant disparities exist in the influence, contributions, possibilities, and challenges related to local SDGs. This underscores the critical importance of adjusting strategies tailored to specific population dynamics for effectively implementing SDGs. Long-term residents may possess deeper local knowledge and a stronger sense of conservation, enabling them to achieve more sustainable outcomes (Hribar et al., 2015 ). Conversely, new residents may bring fresh perception and innovative approaches but may require targeted integration strategies to fully participate in local SDGs. Age-related differences suggest that younger and older populations may have varying priorities and capacities for participation, highlighting the need for age-inclusive policies. Understanding these demographic nuances allows for the formulation of more equitable and effective policies, bridging gaps and leveraging the unique strengths of communities to promote inclusive participation in sustainable development. This demographic-focused approach enhances the resilience and adaptability of local communities to achieve SDGs (Giliberto and Labadi, 2022 ). However, caution must be exercised when considering the applicability of our research results to other regions and cultural backgrounds. While the principles of heritage conservation and sustainable development are universal, the interaction between these principles and local environments and cultural values may exhibit subtle differences. Various geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic conditions may influence the degree to which residents form emotional connections with their environment and engage in conservation efforts.   5 Conclusion Using methodologies encompassing questionnaire surveys, interviews, and data analysis, this study examined the multifaceted interplay between heritage conservation, sustainable development goals, and public perception at the Guilin Karst World Natural Heritage Site. By integrating the perception of local residents, the research endeavored to forge a more inclusive and participatory path towards the management and conservation of our shared natural heritage. The primary data collection method relied on questionnaire surveys, but due to limitations in platforms and resources, only a limited number of residents were surveyed successfully. Furthermore , while local residents are key stakeholders, the sustainable development of the Guilin Karst World Heritage necessitates the involvement and support of diverse actors, including government bodies, tourists, and other pertinent stakeholders. In future research, it would be beneficial to include a more extensive sample of residents to improve the study's representation. Additionally, a broader spectrum of stakeholders should be involved and potentially integrated into a comprehensive framework, such as the community-environment-development nexus. This integration could eventually evolve into marketable products or services. However, it's essential to recognize that this is a long-term endeavor. Moreover, given the inter-connection of natural, social, and economic factors, it's advisable to employ diverse data collection methods and interdisciplinary expertise. This approach will enable a more robust and scientifically rigorous analysis, fostering a balanced approach to the conservation and sustainable management of World Natural Heritage sites.
