               The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a plan of action for people, planet, and prosperity. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are interlinked, interconnected, and complex in nature; therefore, they are considered as a nexus model and a whole-of-society approach is required to ensure the successful implementation of the SDGs. The commitment of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) toward sustainable development, technology, and innovation is at the heart of the vision for the future of the country and for the planet. The UAE, through the World Governments Summit, has incepted the Global Councils on SDGs to drive global implementation of the SDGs. The councils, chaired by interdisciplinary global leaders, drive the implementation of the SDGs through a nexus model approach. This chapter focuses on one council addressing health and well-being, namely Katsina Eye Care Program, and one council utilizing geospatial information systems (GIS) to enhance implementation across all SDGs. Acknowledging the importance of the cross-cutting issue of youth in the SDGs, the chapter further presents the SDG Young Leaders Program initiated by the UAE, including the program launch and integration of youth representatives in the Global Councils.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are interlinked, interconnected, and complex in nature; therefore, they are considered as a nexus model and a whole-of-society approach is required to ensure the successful implementation of the SDGs. The commitment of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) toward sustainable development, technology, and innovation is at the heart of the vision for the future of the country and for the planet. The UAE, through the World Governments Summit, has incepted the Global Councils on SDGs to drive global implementation of the SDGs. The councils, chaired by interdisciplinary global leaders, drive the implementation of the SDGs through a nexus model approach. This chapter focuses on one council addressing health and well-being, namely Katsina Eye Care Program , and one council utilizing geospatial information systems (GIS) to enhance implementation across all SDGs. Acknowledging the importance of the cross-cutting issue of youth in the SDGs, the chapter further presents the SDG Young Leaders Program initiated by the UAE, including the program launch and integration of youth representatives in the Global Councils.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals  SDGs  SDG nexus model  SDG implementation  United Arab Emirates and the SDGs  Global Councils on SDGs  Innovation  Technology innovation  Youth and the SDGs   Introduction A nexus is defined as a connection or series of connections linking two or more ideas, elements, groups, or things as the central and most important intersection, point, or place. The Nexus Model of the Sustainable Development Goals highlights the intersection of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This model has been adopted in the “SDGs in Action” initiative of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre, 2022a ). “SDGs in Action” takes place within the official agenda of the World Governments Summit. The summit is the world's leading platform to shape the future of government. This chapter demonstrates the value of this nexus model and shows how this approach serves as a paradigm of how health innovations in the post-COVID-19 recovery period and beyond can address several sustainable development goals and be creative to introduce innovation and technology into their plan. Two examples are described in this context. The Katsina Eye Care program in Nigeria, which merges SDG 3 (good health and well-being) with SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 4 (quality education), and SDG 5 (gender equality), was formally presented at the launch of the second term of the UAE's “SDGs in Action” campaign. In another example, a Geospatial Information Systems intervention represents the nexus on education SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) at the heart, with impact and relevance to all other SDGs. Leveraging the series of connections and aligned with the UAE's commitment to youth development, the UAE initiated the SDG Young Leaders Program designed to empower youth through knowledge transfer opportunities to building capacity of future sustainable leaders. The program, launched in January 2022 during Expo 2020—Dubai's Global Goals Week, integrated youth representatives into the Global Councils on SDGs initiative. In March 2022, during the World Governments Summit coinciding with the final week of Expo 2020, the program hosted an event themed “WGS Youth for SDGs: Compassion, Passion, and Action for a Better Tomorrow.” The event featured internationally renowned personalities, including the first Minister of Youth, the Director-General of the Nuclear Energy Agency, and an international psychologist Dr. Judy Kuriansky, coauthor of this chapter and volume, who interacted with youth from the audience, as described in this chapter.  Background In September 2015, 193 United Nations (UN) Member States and world leaders gathered in New York at the UN General Assembly to endorse the set of new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a blueprint for the next 15 years. The scope and ambition of the SDGs individually and as a collective plan are greater than anything that the international community has ever attempted before, and rightly so. The SDGs aim to transform our world and to “leave no one behind,” while ensuring the future of all peoples and the planet. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) activated the SDGs with a first-of-its-kind and dedicated event at the World Governments Summit Organization, called “SDGs in Action.” The stages of this campaign are shown in Fig. 1  . The inaugural “SDGs in Action” event in February 2016 focused on “The Role of Monitoring, Reporting and Financing the implementation of the SDGs. ” The follow-up event, held the next year at the World Governments Summit (WGS) in February 2017, discussed “The Role of Science, Technology and Innovation in achieving the SDGs. ” The 2018 theme of the “SDGs in Action” focused on “Partnerships Supporting Innovation for our Common Future, ” in order to break down silos and find innovative means to progress the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The outcome of the event saw the inception of the Global Councils on SDGs  2018–20, with a singular SDG approach at the core of the council's work programs. Of note, in 2019, several of the innovations which were deemed to have the most potential for advancing the SDGs, including the “Health in Your Hands” platform (presented in another chapter in this volume (Kuriansky, 2024 )), were presented at the United Nations at the Science, Technology and Innovation Forum, sponsored by the Mission of the UAE to the United Nations. The Global Councils on Sustainable Development Goals (Global Councils on SDGs, 2021 ) is a unique interdisciplinary network of decision makers from governments, international organizations, academia, and the private sector coming together to share innovative practices and discuss the creative implementation of the 17 SDGs at the national and global level. The initiative was launched as a cross collaborative project between the UAE Prime Minister's Office (PMO), the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre (FCSC), and the World Governments Summit Organization. The mission of the Global Councils is as follows:(a) Identify factors, which are inhibiting progress toward their particular SDG  (b) Find solutions to issues identified and develop a plan for the implementation of successful policies, programs, technologies, and/or innovative service delivery mechanisms to resolve the issues  (c) Build a framework for knowledge sharing among multiple stakeholders, within and between countries, that will catalyze the council's vision of sustainability well into the future.    The 2019 edition of the “SDGs in Action” focused on “Leadership for Achieving the Goals ” that featured a combination of plenary sessions and Global Councils’ breakout sessions. It aimed to foster partnerships and cooperation among council members in their respective fields to support the implementation of specific goals. In 2020, amid the novel Coronavirus when travel was restricted, the “SDGs in Action” event took to the virtual world and hosted the councils to celebrate success stories from the inaugural term, under the theme “SDGs Global Councils: Preparing for the Decade of Action. ” The meeting brought together presenters some of whom have since configured into initial nexus models (described later in this chapter). For example, the Finance Advisory Board, chaired by Marie Aimee Boury, managing director of Impact-Based Finance of Société Generale, speaking on the panel about “The Way Forward... How Do We Get There?” is at the time of this writing working with SDG 3 on Health, which was presented by Dr. Judy Kuriansky, who spoke on the panel about “Realizing Human Potential for All,” as well as other councils. Panelists on that panel are shown in Fig. 2  . The event concluded with a Call to Action for the global community to nominate themselves to support and accelerate the implementation of the SDGs through the councils, which has been transformed to form a nexus model approach, especially as the SDGs are interlinked and complex in nature. Two examples of this interlinkage are shown later in this chapter. Under the theme “Galvanizing the Global Acceleration of the SDGs ” and on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly 2021, the second cohort of the Global Councils on SDGs met to have general introductions and to set expectations to further progress the implementation of the global goals. The 2021–23 councils are set to drive impact toward the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. While continuing chairpersons of the term 2018–20 will focus on their respective singular SDGs, the nexus model approach has been introduced to encourage new council chairpersons to adopt innovative projects, whitepapers, or initiatives that interlink the SDGs and to rebuild sustainably in a post-COVID-19 world.  The SDG in Action meeting in 2022 in Dubai At the 2022 SDGs in Action, held in Dubai in-person, January 15–17, initiative was presented in its next phase in a special 3-day session. This was held during the Global Goals thematic week coinciding with Expo 2020—Dubai, themed “Decade of Action: Accelerate SDG Implementation. ” The 17 Global Councils on SDGs 2021–23 officially launched the work programs. This was done in the presence of multiple ministers of the UAE and the United Nations deputy secretary-general, Amina J. Mohammed. Eight of the councils embarked on dedicated work programs to ensure the nexus model remains at the core of the second cohort, while the remainder of councils acknowledged the importance of cross council collaboration and impact across multiple SDGs in their respective work programs. The WGS SDGs in Action, held March 29–30 under the theme “Scaling New Heights for the Future of Humanity,” continued its legacy to serve as platform to establish partnerships for the goals. The focus of the councils incorporated the nexus model, ensuring an impact-driven approach that will support the Global Councils to address different global goals in a single project, whitepaper, or initiative. Each council's nexus model must have a “focus” goal and include a combination of additional goals. Fig. 3   shows the session “Change Agents Showing Endless Possibilities” with Dr. Mohammad Pate, the cochair of the second term of the GC SDG3 (Health), Julio Frenk, professor of the Practice of Public Health Leadership at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (presenting on behalf also of his cochair Dr. Zsuzsanna Jakab, deputy-general of the World Health Organization), with Marie Aimee Boury, chair of the Finance Advisory Board, whose Global Councils are collaborating.  The SDGs in Action meeting in 2023 in Dubai The SDGs in Action at World Governments Summit 2023 held February 12–15 activated and scaled actions toward the Decade of Action with a theme “Redesigning the Future of Our World: 2030 Principles and beyond.” The 2023 version addressed fundamental challenges to implement the global goals and reshaped our common for generations to come. The Global Councils on SDGs commenced with tailored workshops to support and drive impact toward the SDGs and reported their midterm progress and aspirations to conclude work programs in February 2024.  Background of the nexus model The following are some principles of the nexus model.(a) Some situations cannot be addressed through single sector actions taken in isolation.  (b) A coherent and integrated nexus approach can help identify synergies and trade-offs, leading to better outcomes for current and future generations.  (c) The 17 SDGs, adopted by UN member states in September 2015, affect practically all aspects of public policy.  (d) Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (PCSD) assists in understanding the interlinkages between economic, social, and environmental policies when related to access, availability, and sustainability of our planet's natural resources.  (e) The nexus approach will enable the councils to identify linkages, overcome trade-offs, and ensure synergies are utilized.    One council (Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre, 2022b ) launched a nexus model that drives impact toward SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), while several councils introduced work programs interlinking multiple other SDGs.  Examples of the nexus models in action The nexus model interlinkage is shown in Fig. 4   for two of the examples described in the text, with one set of lines (in the color red) showing the connection between the SDGs for one example, and the other set (in the color green) showing the interconnection of the SDGs for the other example.  The nexus model of SDGs 1, 3, 4, and 5 Dr. Manal Taryam, chief executive officer, and board member Noor Dubai Foundation, serves as chairperson to the council targeting SDG 3 with a nexus model to SDGs 1 (End Poverty), 4 (Quality Education), and 5 (Gender Equality), through cataract and refractive error services, as part of the Katsina Eye Care Program  in Nigeria. Cataract and refractive error are the two major causes of blindness and visual impairment globally responsible for vision loss in over 2.2 billion people in the world. The interrelationship of these SDGs is shown in Fig. 4  (in red color). The concept of the Katsina Eye Care Program aims at improving the quality of life and the socioeconomic status of the people of the Katsina state in Nigeria and will contribute to reducing blindness and visual impairment in the state by at least 30%–40%. The objectives of the project include:(a) Raise the effective cataract surgical coverage in Katsina state by at least 50%, taking into consideration gender equality, within 4 years.  (b) Improve refractive error services among schoolchildren in parts of Katsina state by at least 50%, with an increase in effective refractive error coverage among the students screened in selected schools within 2 years.    The program has identified milestones aligned with the nexus approach and includes:(a) Conducting 11,000 cataract surgeries in the state in 4 years.  (b) Ensuring more than 80% of operated cases achieve good surgical outcomes.  (c) Ensuring gender equality in the cataract surgery delivery such that at least 50% of recipients are women.  (d) Conducting eye screening of 160,000 elementary school pupils across 160 elementary schools in the state.  (e) Conducting eye screening of 3000 teachers in the 160 schools.  (f) Providing refractive error corrections to at least 1500 pupils and 1500 teachers.    In 2022 the council reported progress in Noor Dubai Foundation's annual report (Noor-Dubai, n.d. ). A total of 17,519 screenings took place, complemented with 9273 surgeries. The Katsina Eye Care Program further trained 267 people and provided 250 primary health centers with basic eye screening equipment that benefited 7.5 million people indirectly. In addition, Noor Dubai launched the Katsina School Eye Health Program in 2022 with the main objective of improving access to eye care services to school students and teachers. A total of 161,524 students and 1800 teachers were screened while 88 teachers and ophthalmic nurses were trained. The program actively drives psychological, social, and academic development of children that will have positive long-term impact on society. The council's expected outcomes address health/medical, social, educational, and economic aspects of life in their respective communities. The council will address multiple aspects including economic (increased employment, productivity, and income), social (reduced extreme poverty and hunger, increased independence, self-esteem and gender equality, and improved social networks), health (improved quality of life measured in DALYs averted and QALYs gained, reduced mortality rates), and education (achieving universal primary education, increased school attendance and academic achievements, and improved teaching by teachers).  Nexus model of SDGs 4 and 17, with relevance to all SDGs Clint Brown, director at Esri, serves as chairperson of the Geospatial Information Systems Education Council that focuses on SDGs 4 (quality education) and 17 (partnerships for the goals), with relevance to the additional 15 global goals. The council, driven on Esri technology, learned from experiences and is implementing an SDG framework worldwide to promote GIS as an effective tool to address the implementation and report on the progress made toward the 2030 Agenda. The council provides lessons and tutorials for understanding and progressing the SDGs and encourages the global community to adopt technology to accelerate the implementation of the global goals. Resources that are available include websites like SDG Data Alliance (SDG Data Alliance, n.d. ), the UAE's SDGs Data Hub (UAE SDGS Data Hub, n.d. ), and the SDG Geospatial Learning Lab (SDG Geospatial Library, n.d. ). The council, with Esri, has achieved key milestones including the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals Solution in November 2022, facilitating government sharing of SDG progress and community engagement. In February 2023, the council released “Storytelling for a Sustainable World” that offers a collection of all SDG stories complemented by data, sample stories, and learning resources. In addition, the SDG Learning Lab was launched in January 2023 and delivers tutorials and lessons for SDG achievement under the name SDG Geospatial Learning Lab. The latter includes unique tutorials and content relevant to each of the 17 global goals, including 14 tutorials and 15 content-related materials on SDG 3 (good health and well-being). The SDG 3 workflows and tutorials utilize problem-solving exercises and hands-on learning experiences through GIS applications, including policy mapping to improve newborn health, monitoring malaria pandemics, and supporting midwives worldwide. As an outcome, the council has reported in the Global Councils on SDGs midterm progress report (Publications (SDGs), n.d. ) February 2023 edition that the SDG Geospatial Learning Lab, in February 2023, published a total of 320 tutorials and related content.a  a The text mentioned before serves as summaries of the two respective Global Councils on SDGs contribution to the Global Councils on SDGs midterm report, published by the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre in February 2023. Full details can be found in the mentioned report, available on the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre official website.   The FCSC, in its capacity as Secretariat to the UAE National Committee on SDGs and the Global Councils on SDGs, invites everyone to follow the progress of the Global Councils on SDGs through the UAE SDG Data Hub (UAE SDGS Data Hub, n.d. ) (https://sdgsuae-fcsa.opendata.arcgis.com/ ) and actively engages in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In reaction to the “SDGS in Action” campaign, the UAE Minister of State for International Cooperation, Her Excellency Reem bint Ebrahim Al Hashimy, president of the Global Councils on SDGs, has said: Today [16 September 2021] , we welcome 17 distinguished Councils who will embark on the second term of the Global Councils on SDGs. The term will divert from a singular SDG approach to a nexus approach. Giving the complexity and interlinkages of the SDGs, the Councils will galvanize and accelerate the implementation of the goals through innovative partnerships, inspiring projects, and informative white papers that will advance our understanding of one another as well as the challenges we face as a society today. (World Government Summit, 2021 )   During the official launch of the Global Councils on SDGs 2021/2023, Al Hashimy said:The launch of the second cohort of the Global Councils on SDGs during the Expo 2020 – Dubai's Global Goals thematic week, is a reconfirmation of the UAE's commitment to strengthen its role in enhancing the welfare of societies and inclusive sustainable development. The UAE government is driven to support the global implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and reiterated its commitment to complement the Decade of Action. (Emirates News Agency, 2022 )   During the official launch of the second term of the Global Goals at Expo 2020—Dubai, referred to earlier and described in more detail later, the United Nations deputy secretary-general, Amina J. Mohammed, said:Global partnerships are the pathway to achieve global sustainability. The Global Councils for SDGs is a prime example of bringing together decision makers and thought-leaders across multiple disciplines and geographies to tackle, head on, some of the world's most pressing issues, bringing together, world governments, private sector, academia and societies, to deliver decisive action aimed to build a sustainable future that leaves no one behind. (Emirates News Agency, 2022 )    The cross-cutting issue of youth as part of the SDGS in Action initiative Consistent with the guidelines of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, several issues are considered cross-cutting, meaning a topic identified as important that affects most or all aspects of development and therefore should be integrated and mainstreamed throughout all the goals, and also the stages of development from policy to implementation and evaluation. Youth is one of these topics. Thus the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre, in its capacity as the secretariat of the UAE National Committee on SDGs, has been keen on empowering and enabling youth in the UAE and actively involving them in the UAE journey toward the implementation of the SDGs. The FCSC in partnership with the Federal Youth Authority, UAE CSR Fund, and the UAE Government Leadership Program launched the SDG Young Leaders Program in January 2022 to provide youth with the knowledge, experience, and skills necessary to participate effectively in supporting and leading national and international initiative and programs to achieve the SDGs and become the leaders of the future. The dedicated platform for youth dialogue engages the youth of the UAE in the Decade of Action for the SDGs. The program includes three different tracks for a new journey toward inclusive youth development:(1) SDGs Youth Council, where the youth members will be working closely with the Secretariat of the UAE National Committee on SDGs on developing initiatives and projects that encourage UAE youth involvement in the SDGs and develop SDG-related studies, initiatives, and policy proposals to support the objectives of the UAE National Committee on SDGs.  (2) Youth Media Council for SDGs, this group aims to educate, captivate, and accelerate youth's involvement in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and highlight the power of media and how youth approach media.  (3) Global Councils on SDGs Youth Representatives, the 2021/23 Councils will each have a youth member to ensure capacity development for future global decision makers.    In fulfillment of these goals, the SDG Young Leaders held a launch event meant to inspire our young leaders with heart-to-heart dialogue with global figures to inspire young leaders in their journey to fulfill the SDGs. The program was held on the margins of the WGS 2022, on the topic of “WGS Youth for SDGs: Passion, Action and Compassion for a Better Tomorrow.” This program, held at the Youth Pavilion at Expo 2020—Dubai, was organized by the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre. Members of the panel and organizers, as well as student attendees, are shown in Fig. 5  . The session was moderated by His Excellency Abdulla Nasser Lootah, Deputy Minister of Cabinet Affairs for Competitiveness and Knowledge Exchange, vice president of the Global Councils on SDGs and vice chairman of the UAE National Committee on SDGs, who gracefully and with great dynamism introduced the topic about passion, action, and compassion, embodying these qualities, setting the stage for the speakers. Opening remarks were made by Mr. William Magwood, noted physicist and director-general of the Nuclear Energy Agency, who described how energy and education is important for youth, highlighted the power of youth in creating change, and encouraged youth to have a sense of urgency and passion. Ferid Belhaj, vice president of the World Bank in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, who was previously in charge of the banks’ programs in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran, described the Arab region as raising up with its youth, calling youth of the MENA region “The Bright Spot” as he sees the future as a brighter tomorrow with the power of the youth as the real energy, hope, and drivers of change. But it is the responsibility of the leaders in the region to give youth knowledge and hope. Featured speaker, noted international psychologist Dr. Judy Kuriansky, gave a highly interactive and passionate presentation, entitled a “Heart-to-heart action plan for youth.” In this dialogue, she described the positive climate for mental health and well-being, and involvement of youth at the United Nations and globally, reflected in the inspiring approach of “Positive thinking and family & community cohesion” and thematically related books by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, as well as reflected in the happiness theme incorporated in the UAE government policy and plans. An important point, shown in Fig. 6   in her engaging slide presentation, is that mental health is being recognized as a priority by global leaders and critical to achieve inclusive and sustainable development—especially given the emotional issues triggered in populations worldwide trying to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Pictured are the World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and United Nations Secretary-General His Excellency António Guterres, and also United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Her Excellency Amina J. Mohammed who have all spoken out passionately and definitively about the importance of mental health. Dr. Judy, as she is fondly called, also presented concrete actions that youth can take to advance the SDGs, within her philosophy of being brave, creative, resilient, and going for your dreams, which inspired youth who were present to give personal examples. In the interactive part of the dialogue, she went into the audience and engaged individuals in selected activities she uses worldwide to promote resilience, much to the assemblage's enjoyment. Several youth volunteered how they appreciated her unique action-oriented end engaging presentation style (unique in contrast to more usual one-way lectures) and how memorable her messages of empowerment were, and how even she had “changed their lives.” As shown in Fig. 7  , Omar Aldhuhoori, member of the SDG Young Leaders Program, shared the importance to him of her message in the Dream Ball activity about identifying and acknowledging your dream—that he said he would remember for the rest of his life. Following the activity she does worldwide for self-fulfillment, Dr. Judy asked him to announce his dream—to have a happy family and to make a difference in the world—to the group, and for them to repeat it back to him—“Omar, you have a happy family and are making a difference on the world”—so he can feel its strength and power, first, as if it is true in the here and now (not the future) and second, that others are “witnessing” and affirming it as real. The joy and love were palpable in the room. Closing Remarks were given by Her Excellency Shamma bint Suhail Faris Al Mazrui, UAE Minister of State for Youth. She spoke about the power of passion and mentioned three important points to harness passion: (1) shedding skin, removing the dead cells preventing growth and being open to transformation and change and unleashing one's full capacity of learning; (2) recognizing the metaphor of music, seeing yourself as an orchestra playing a piece of music in harmony, from the inside, and moving from thinking to expressing; and (3) having courage, to act with harmony and choose motion over being static, and to be self-inspired to take action, in the same way as the UAE is a self-inspired nation that seeks to inspire others. Members of the SDG Young Leaders Program engaged with Dr. Judy Kuriansky after the event to share thoughts and lessons learned, and express appreciation for the lively and memorable presentation.

FCSC is actively involved in raising awareness on the culture of competitiveness and the importance of providing quality and accurate data and statistical information at the national level.  Background: World Governments Summit Organization The World Governments Summit Organization is a global, neutral, nonprofit organization dedicated to shaping the future of governments. The WGS is the largest global platform dedicated to exploring the future of governments driven by technological advances and evolving citizen expectations and highlights future trends in government services, leadership, and innovation. The summit brings together over 4000 leaders, policy makers, academics, and key representatives from international organizations from over 190 countries, thereby creating an exciting opportunity to exchange innovations and experiences and build strong networks for collaboration. Following the adoption of the SDGs in 2015 and as part of the UAE's commitment to their implementation, the World Governments Summit in its fourth edition in 2016 introduced a special track to focus on the SDGs and their implementation. The inaugural “SDGs in Action” at the World Governments Summit event focused on the role of monitoring and reporting and financing in implementing the SDGs, which later became the platform to launch the Global Councils on SDGs. Subsequent sessions were held at the WGS.  Expo 2020—Dubai On 27 November 2013, fireworks painted the sky from the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, as thousands of people across the UAE celebrated the bid to host Expo 2020—Dubai, the first World Expo in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region. The Expo, held from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 (delayed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), under the theme “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future,” consisted of a large area of land with pavilions hosted by countries, partners, and organizations, constructed with their own design and content message featuring one of the three subthemes: opportunity, mobility, or sustainability. The exhibits presented visitors with a vast opportunity to experience displays and interactive demonstrations, films, foods, shows, and goods that inspire, empower, and drive positive environmental, social, and economic change about global issues, and as a totality, to feel the unity of the world that is so needed right now. After the Expo 2020 closed on March 31, 2022, the physical site is being transformed into District 2020, a model global community for the future, and home to world-class innovation, educational, cultural, and entertainment facilities. District 2020 has been designed to support the future of work and living and to facilitate connection and collaboration, serving as home to new ideas and innovations in an inclusive and diverse community thriving in a balanced and sustainable way of life.  The way forward The FCSC and the WGS remain committed to support the Global Councils on SDGs, with its interdisciplinary network of chairpersons, vice chairs, youth, and members, to continue its journey to support the global implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Decade of Action. The individual councils’ work programs focus on innovative projects that follow the nexus model and accelerate the SDGs, and also that are currently, and for the future, working together in the spirit of SDG 17 about partnerships, to accelerate global prosperity for the people and the planet. The Youth Leaders Program continues to expand to represent the importance of the youth role in achievement of the SDGs and in sync with the Global Councils, with a youth member on each council.
