                  Sustainable Development Goal 7 and Goal 13 are important for evaluating carbon emission reduction capacity in urban agglomerations. Exploring the spatial correlation network structures of carbon emission reduction capacity can help synergize carbon reduction actions between cities. Existing research regarding the urban agglomerations to address carbon emission reduction goals has neglected both coordination with Sustainable Development Goals and the impact of spatial correlation network structures. Based on Sustainable Development Goals, an evaluation system of carbon emission reduction capacity is constructed. The characteristics of spatial correlation network structure for carbon emission reduction capacity are described using the social network analysis method. Its driving factors are described using the quadratic assignment procedure method. The Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration in China is used for validation. The spatial distribution of carbon emission reduction capacity in urban agglomerations is significantly unbalanced, and the spatial correlation network structure follows a stable core-edge pattern. Factors such as differences in technological level, economic level affect the formation of the spatial correlation, but the differences in urbanization level have no significant impact. Countermeasures are proposed to provide a scientific basis for the collaborative management of carbon emission reduction in urban agglomerations.

Fig 10   Table 1 Basis for the construction of the indicator system and its role in the carbon emission reduction capacity.  Table 1     Dimension Rationale for construction The role in the carbon emission reduction capacity Reference   Economic growth SDG13.4 Economic growth provides strong financial security for carbon emission reduction and increases the level of investment. Liang et al. (2024)   Technology and carbon sinks SDG7.4, SDG13.1 Technological advances promote clean energy research and technology. A high level of carbon sinks facilitates carbon storage and fixation or reduces the cost of carbon emission reduction through carbon sink trading. Liu et al. (2024)   Energy consumption and carbon emissions SDG7.2, SDG7.3 Energy intensity reflects the efficiency of comprehensive energy utilization. A reduction in energy intensity is conducive to carbon reduction. Zheng et al. (2023)   Industrial development SDG7.1, SDG7.5 The proportion of secondary and tertiary industries reflects the degree of dependence on industry for economic growth and the provision of modern energy services to promote carbon reduction. Zhang et al. (2022)   Social development SDG13.2, SDG13.3, SDG13.5 Early warning of climate hazards is publicized, regional planning and management capacity is improved. The social development provides a good basis for carbon reduction. Tan et al.

Xi'an University of Technology 58 Yanxiang Road Xi'an City Shaanxi Province China       Sustainable Development Goal 7 and Goal 13 are important for evaluating carbon emission reduction capacity in urban agglomerations. Exploring the spatial correlation network structures of carbon emission reduction capacity can help synergize carbon reduction actions between cities. Existing research regarding the urban agglomerations to address carbon emission reduction goals has neglected both coordination with Sustainable Development Goals and the impact of spatial correlation network structures. Based on Sustainable Development Goals, an evaluation system of carbon emission reduction capacity is constructed. The characteristics of spatial correlation network structure for carbon emission reduction capacity are described using the social network analysis method. Its driving factors are described using the quadratic assignment procedure method. The Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration in China is used for validation. The spatial distribution of carbon emission reduction capacity in urban agglomerations is significantly unbalanced, and the spatial correlation network structure follows a stable core-edge pattern. Factors such as differences in technological level, economic level affect the formation of the spatial correlation, but the differences in urbanization level have no significant impact. Countermeasures are proposed to provide a scientific basis for the collaborative management of carbon emission reduction in urban agglomerations.

Carbon emission reduction actions are closely related to the realization of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) “Affordable and clean energy ” and Sustainable Development Goal13 (SDG 13) “Climate action ” (Adom et al., 2021 ; Oloruntobi et al., 2024 ). Furthermore, the realization of SDG 7 directly impacts the outcome of SDG 13 (Madurai Elavarasan et al., 2023 ). Carbon emissions are accelerating global warming, and cities have a significant impact (Rosenzweig et al., 2010 ). Chinese urban carbon emissions account for approximately 80 % of the global total (Yue et al., 2023 ). Internationally, in low-income large cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai in India, Cairo in Egypt, and Islamabad in Pakistan (Judith & Ayyoob, 2022 ), irrational urban and industrial layouts and overreliance on fossil energy have hindered carbon emission reduction and their abilities to realize the SDGs. To fulfil its international commitment to “peak carbon and carbon neutrality ”, it is implementing a strategy of using urban agglomerations (UAs) to resolve excessive carbon emissions in China. The UAs are spatial organization forms that are dependent on certain natural environmental conditions within a specific geographic unit. They comprise cities with different functional positions, spatial structures, population sizes, economic output, etc. Moreover, these cities are linked by modern means of transport and accessible, comprehensive transportation and information networks. The UAs are becoming an important mainstay of synergistic carbon mitigation governance (Zhou et al., 2022 ). Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration (GPUA) of China, with its coal-based energy consumption and complex industrial structure covering numerous high-energy-consuming industries, such as chemicals, iron and steel, and building materials. It is a typical case pressured by the need to both reduce carbon emissions and realize the SDGs. The development of UAs is fundamentally influenced by the structure of spatial correlations (Zhu et al., 2021 ). Central cities have obvious advantages due to the agglomeration of population, economy and other factors, which can enhance the competitiveness and development of neighbouring cities while promoting the efficient use of production factors (Wang et al., 2022b ; Yang et al., 2022 ). However, the spatial spillover effect of carbon emissions makes it possible for carbon mitigation actions to trigger free-riding behaviour . That is, cities can enjoy the benefits of carbon mitigation actions without paying the associated costs (Chen et al., 2019 ; Liu & Liu, 2019 ). The reason for these situations is that, cities which actively implement carbon reduction actions bear more associated costs, but neighbouring cities also benefit. The asymmetry of the costs and benefits on carbon governance among cities gives some cities an incentive to rely on the carbon reduction actions of other cities. At the same time, the siphon effect of central cities on neighbouring cities further exacerbates the imbalance of development within UAs. Exploring the spatial correlation network structure that determines the carbon emission reduction capacity (CERC) of UAs and its driving factors can help determine useful countermeasures for synergistic carbon emission reduction actions among cities. However, existing research has neglected not only ways in which to realize the SDGs in harmony with the carbon emission reduction targets of UAs, but also the impacts of spatial correlation network structures on the sustainable development of UAs. The objectives of this study are to establish the linkage between the CERC of UAs and SDGs, and to analyse the characteristics of the spatial correlation network structure of UAs. It is explored countermeasures that can enhance the CERC of UAs from the spatial correlation perspective according to the social network analysis (SNA) method, and validated this approach by using the GPUA as a case study. The academic contribution and significance of this study lies in the following. First, based on SDG 7 and SDG 13, and their subgoals, carbon emission reduction and environmental pollution reduction are incorporated into synergistic governance. An evaluation system of SDGs-oriented CERC is constructed, which expands the research horizons of carbon emission reduction in UAs. Second, the spatial correlation network structure of the CERC in UAs is not only a pure geographical proximity relationship, but also a typical core-edge pattern. Moreover, the differences in technological level have a significant effect on the spatial correlation network structure, which provides a scientific basis for UAs to realize the synergistic management of carbon emission reduction.  2 Literature review The fundamental analysis of CERC have involved measuring carbon emissions by using the input-output analysis method, the life cycle assessment method and the emission inventory method of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Miao et al., 2023 ). Additionally, the factors that cause changes of carbon emission level, including economic growth (Li & Jiang, 2020 ; Wang et al., 2023 ), industrial structure, energy intensity and population size (Liang et al., 2023 ; Zhao et al., 2023 ), have been explored. Further studies have shown that improving technology, accelerating the development of the tertiary sector, and promoting recycling and renewable energy are conducive to reducing carbon emissions. However, a single carbon emission indicator focuses on only the absolute value of emissions and does not account for other multidimensional factors related to the CERC. The construction of evaluation system can explore the differences in the CERC of different regions and provide a solid scientific basis for formulating differentiated carbon emission reduction countermeasures. Most of the existing CERC evaluation systems include energy consumption and carbon emissions, carbon sinks, industrial development, economic growth, technological capacity, and social development (Di et al., 2022 ; Tan et al., 2017 ; Wang et al., 2021a ). However, these factors are not reflected in the SDGs for improving the sustainability of socioeconomic and environment. In the context of increasingly prominent global issues such as climate change, the link between the SDGs and the CERC must be considered. Therefore, the establishment of the CERC evaluation system from a perspective of SDGs has certain academic value and practical significance. Cities are becoming increasingly interconnected, and no longer exist in isolation (Chang et al., 2022 ; Hu et al., 2023 ). Existing research has explored the spatial relevance and spatial agglomeration characteristics of carbon emission reduction in UAs (Huo et al., 2022 ), as well as spatial spillover effects and influencing factors (He & Hultman, 2021 ; Wang et al., 2016 ) through spatial autocorrelation (Yuan et al., 2022 ), geographically weighted regression (Han et al., 2023 ; Wang et al., 2019 ), and spatial Durbin model (Liu et al., 2020 ; Zhou et al., 2023 ). Carbon emission reduction measures, such as environmental taxes, cap-and-trade, subsidies for nonfiscal energy sources, and financial support (Song et al., 2023 ), have been proposed. However, the results are based on geographic proximity (Yang & Liu, 2020 ). Thus, they make it difficult to effectively reflect the spatial correlation of carbon emissions in UAs. The SNA method which integrates geographic, economic, and technological factors to reflect remote connections and complex network relationships between nodes. It has been widely used in studies regarding population mobility, carbon emission reduction, economy and trade, tourism economy, total factor productivity, and regional development. Existing research has identified spatial distance, population size differences and economic level differences as the main factors affecting the spatial correlation of carbon emissions (Liu et al., 2023 ; Tao et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2020 ). Moreover, the spatial correlation of carbon emissions in UAs can be used to determine complementary roles between cities (Jiang & Lyu, 2021 ), accelerate the construction of the carbon trading market, and promote synergistic carbon emission reduction (Sun et al., 2020 ). Recent research has begun to focused on the synergistic and trade-off roles of urban buildings in climate change mitigation and SDGs realization (Sebastian et al., 2024 ). However, they overlook the importance of the spatial correlation network structure that determines the CERC to help UAs in advancing carbon governance and realize the SDGs. In this study, GPUA is used as a case to explore the characteristics of the CERC of UAs from an SDGs perspective. The modified gravity model and SNA method are adopted to analyse the spatial correlation network characteristics of the CERC and its driving factors. Finally, countermeasures for differentiated carbon emission reduction in line with SDG 7 and SDG 13 are proposed to provide a scientific basis for UAs to realize the SDGs.  3 Methods and data 3.1 Study design Based on constructing an evaluation system for the CERC, the study determined the weights of the indicators using the entropy weight method. It has identified the characteristics of the spatial correlation network structure of the CERC of UAs using the modified gravitational model and the SNA method, and explored the factors affecting the structure using the QAP method (Fig. 1  ).  3.2 Methods 3.2.1 Construction of carbon emission reduction capacity indicator system This study focused on SDG 7 and SDG 13, and their subgoals. It combined the synergistic effect between carbon emission reduction and environmental pollution reduction (Chen et al., 2023 ; Jiang et al., 2023 ), constructed an evaluation system of the CERC, and explained the basis for the construction of the indicator system and its role in the CERC (Table 1   and Fig. 2  ). The specific process of indicator selection is as follows. In the first round, 5 primary indicators include economic growth, technology and carbon sink, energy consumption and carbon emissions, industrial development, and social development and 27 secondary indicators were selected, with reference to existing research. The second round of indicator selection was conducted based on the “Outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan and Vision 2035 ″, “Outline of the Plan for Ecological Protection and High-Quality Development of the Yellow River Basin ”, “Implementation Program for Reducing Pollution and Carbon Synergies ”, and “14th Five-Year Plan for the Construction of the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration ” issued by the Chinese government and local governments. According to the “Implementation Program for Reducing Pollution and Carbon Synergies ” and existing research (Azizalrahman & Hasyimi, 2018 ), the environmental pollution dimension was included in the evaluation system. Seven indicators of air pollution, water pollution and solid waste, which are closely related to the synergistic management of carbon reduction, were selected and added. Four indicators, including the turnover of the technology market, the contribution rate of high-technology industries, the share of foreign investment in GDP, and the share of import and export trade in GDP, were eliminated, because their raw data was difficult to obtain from statistical bulletins, yearbooks, and official websites. Finally, a CERC evaluation system consisting of 6 primary indicators and 30 secondary indicators was established (Table 2  ).  3.2.2 Measurement of carbon emission reduction capacity The entropy method determines indicator weights based on the relative degree of change in each indicator to the system as a whole. This approach circumvents the subjectivity of assigning weights to the indicators and avoids the possible problem of multicollinearity between the indicators. The specific calculation steps are as follows. First, the raw data were standardized. To unify the unit and outline of the evaluation indicators, the original data were processed without dimension. The calculation formula is as follows. Positive indicator:(1) z i k   = x i k   − min { x i k   }   max { x i k   }  − min { x i k   }    ( i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n ; k = 1 , 2 , . . . , m )       Negative indicator:(2) z i k   = max { x i k   }  − x i k    max { x i k   }  − min { x i k   }    ( i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n ; k = 1 , 2 , . . . , m )       Where i  represents the city and k  represents the indicator. Zik   is the standardized value of city i  in indicator k  in the range of [0,1]. max{xik  } and min{xik  } are the largest and smallest values of the evaluation indicators, respectively. Second, the weights of the indicators were calculated. The calculation formulas are as follows.(3) p ik  = z ik  ∑ i = 1  n  z ik            (4) e k  = − 1 ln ( n )   ∑ i = 1  n  p i k   ln p i k       (5) g k  = 1 − e k      (6) w k  = g k  ∑ k = 1  m  g k            (7) C i  = ∑ k = 1  m  w k  × P i k         Where pik   is the proportion of indicator k  data of city i. ek   is the entropy value of indicator k , with a range of [0,1]. gk   is the coefficient of variation of indicator k. wk   is the weight value of the indicator k  obtained after normalization. Ci   is the CERC of city i . The larger its value is, the greater the CERC of city i .  3.2.3 Modified gravity model The modified gravity model has been widely applied in studies and analyses to measure the strength of interregional connections under spatial interactions (Wang et al., 2022a ). Yu et al. (2022)  comprehensively considered the effects of geographical proximity, economic factors and demographic factors on the spatial distribution of carbon emissions, and combined geographical distance and economic distance to modify the traditional gravity model. On this basis, the modified gravity model is used to measure the linkage degree in the interaction of carbon abatement capacity between cities. The formula is as follows.(8) F ij  = ∂ ij  R i  G i  C i   3  ×  R j  G j  C j   3   D ij  2   , ∂ ij  = C i  C i  + C j    , D ij  2  = ( d ij  p i  − p j    )   2          Where j  represents the city. Fij   is the gravitational force of CERC between city i  and city j . Ri  , Gi  , Ci   and Rj  , Gj  , Cj   represent resident population, GDP, and CERC of city i  and j,  respectively. Dij   and dij   represent the gravitational model distance and geographic separation between city i  and city j,  respectively. pi   and pj   represent the per capita GDP of city i  and city j,  respectively. αij   is the contribution of city i  to the correlation of CERC between city i  and city j . The modified gravity model calculates the spatial correlation gravity matrix of CERC and selects the median mean value of the gravity value as the threshold. If the gravity value is greater than the threshold, the value is taken as 1, indicating that there is a correlation relationship between the two cities. If the gravity value is less than the threshold, the value is taken as 0, indicating that there is no correlation between the two cities.  3.2.4 Social network analysis The SNA method has been widely used in studies on regional carbon emission reduction (Qiu & Ye, 2018 ). The SNA method was used to analyse the overall network characteristics and individual network characteristics of spatial correlation network structure (Table 3  ). The overall network characteristics are characterized by network density, network connectedness, network efficiency, and network hierarchy. Network density measures the closeness of intercity connections. The greater its value is, the closer the network connections are. Network connectedness and network efficiency reflect the stability of the network. The greater their values are, the greater the network stability. Network hierarchy measures the dominance and control position of each city in the network. The higher the value is, the stronger the dominance and control role between cities. Degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality were used to describe individual network characteristics and locate the position and importance of the node city in the network. Degree centrality measures the position of the city in the network. The higher its value is, the more influence the city has on other cities. Betweenness centrality measures the degree to which a city is free from the influence of other cities. The higher its value is, the more likely the city is to be centered in the network. Closeness centrality measures the control or influence over other intercity relationships of a city. The higher the value is, the stronger the influence of city on the flow of information or the transfer of resources in the network.  3.2.5 Quadratic assignment procedure The QAP analysis is performed by comparing the lattice values between the nodes in a matrix, which requires that the matrix for regression is a binary matrix and a square matrix with the same nodes. In this study, 11 cities were used as matrix nodes to construct an 11 ×   11 square matrix. The Ucinet software was used to transform the matrix into a binary value matrix, which meets this applicable condition. Referring to the results (Dong & Li, 2022 ), the independent variables included the spatial adjacency (A ), differences in economic level (E ), differences in technological level (T ), differences in energy intensity (F ), differences in industrial structure (P ), differences in urbanization level (U ), and differences in waste disposal level (W ) (Table 4  ), while the dependent variable was the spatial correlation network of the CERC 0–1 matrix (Net). Thus, the QAP regression model was established. The model is set as follows.(9) N e t = f ( A , E , T , F , P , U , W  )       The average values for the corresponding indicators were chosen between 2010 and 2021. A difference matrix for the QAP correlation and regression analysis was constructed using the absolute differences of cities from one another. To remove the impact of the disparity in the magnitudes of the driving factors on the regression outcomes, the data were standardized for polar deviation. The formula is the same as Eqs. (1) and (2) .   3.3 Data sources Relevant data sources are listed in Table 5  . Notably, publicly available data on emissions of some pollutants in Yuncheng and Linfen and energy consumption in Tianshui, Pingliang and Qingyang could not be obtained due to the different statistical calibres of the cities. In order to complement the data, the ratio of municipal industrial nitrogen oxide emissions to provincial industrial nitrogen oxide emissions was taken as the ratio of municipal industrial wastewater emissions to provincial municipal industrial wastewater emissions. The proportions of urban total energy consumption, industrial solid emissions, and industrial sulphur dioxide emissions in the province were the proportions of the urban value added of the secondary industry. The missing data were converted by using the relevant year-on-year provincial data for each city. Missing data for individual years were calculated based on the average annual growth rate of available data.  3.4 Case description The GPUA is located in the centre of Northwest China and is an important pivot point of the Asia-Europe Continental Bridge (Fig. 3  ). It covers a land area of 107,100 km2 , including Xi'an, Tongchuan, Baoji, Xianyang, Weinan, Shangluo, Qingyang, Tianshui, Pingliang, Linfen, and Yuncheng. For statistical reasons, the study area does not include the Yangling Agricultural High-Tech Industrial Demonstration Zone. In 2022, the GDP of the GPUA was 38.64 billion USD, and the population was 43.33 million residents. The urban agglomeration has rich natural and mineral resources, many resource-oriented cities, and a heavy industrial structure. The energy structure that is primarily based on fossil fuels and is challenging to modify rapidly. Xi'an, Tongchuan, Baoji, Xianyang, Weinan, Linfen and Yuncheng are the primary locations for coordinated air pollution prevention and control. The water quality of some sections of the Weihe and Fenhe River Basins is severely polluted, and groundwater overexploitation is prominent. The achievement of SDG 7 and SDG 13 and the reduction in carbon emissions are challenging for such UAs. Xi'an, as the only national central city in the GPUA, has formed a siphon effect from the agglomeration of population, economy, culture and other factors, but has not played a radiation-driven role for other cities. Furthermore, an imbalance in development has made achieving synergy in carbon emission reduction more difficult. The key to solving this problem is to assess the CERC of cities in multiple dimensions and to improve synergistic governance level of UAs from a perspective of spatial linkages.   4 Results 4.1 Spatial and temporal evolution of carbon emission reduction capacity Fig. 4   shows that the CERC of the GPUA increased from 1.73 in 2010 to 2.89 in 2021, representing a gradual increase of 67.05 %. Due to space limitations, the years 2010, 2014, 2017, and 2021 were selected as representative years to present the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics (Fig. 5  ). In 2010, only Xi'an had a CERC greater than 0.20, while the remaining cities had a CERC lower than 0.16, which is relatively low. In 2014, Baoji and Xianyang had CERC in the range of 0.18–0.20, followed by Xi'an. Those of Shangluo and Linfen slightly decreased, while those of other cities improved. In 2017, Baoji was the second-largest city after Xi'an, with a CERC greater than 0.20, while the CERC of other cities also improved to between 0.16 and 0.20. In 2021, the number of cities with CERC greater than 0.20 increased to seven, which is more than half of the number of cities in the GPUA. However, the CERC of Pingliang was only 0.17, much smaller than that of Xi'an, which was 0.41 in 2010. The obvious differences in the CERC between the central city and neighbouring cities, and the lack of radiation drive by the central city to neighbouring cities cause the spatial distribution to be significantly imbalanced. This situation indicates that the improvement in collaborative governance capacity and the establishment of a carbon emission reduction synergistic mechanism are key for promoting the carbon governance of UAs. Figs. 6 and 7    show that, first, cities with higher CERC had greater contributions from the social development dimension, the technology and carbon sink dimension, and the economic growth dimension. These cities were more likely to provide sound infrastructure, advanced technological support for CERC mitigation, greater sequestration capacity and strong financial security for carbon emission reduction, thus contributing to the realization of SDG7.5 “Expand and upgrade energy services for developing countries ”, SDG7.4 “Promote access to research, technology and investments in clean energy ”, SDG13.1 “Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate related disasters ”, and SDG13.4 “Implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ”. Cities with a developed industrial structure favoured SDG7.1 “Universal access to modern energy ” and SDG7.5 “Expand and upgrade energy services for developing countries ”. Second, cities with a low CERC had greater contributions to the energy consumption, carbon emission dimensions, and the environmental pollution dimension. Cities with high levels of energy consumption and carbon emissions were industrially developed and heavily reliant on fossil energy, leading to significant carbon emissions, which is detrimental to realizing SDG7.2 “Increase global percentage of renewable energy ” and SDG7.3“Double the improvement in energy efficiency ”. Environmental pollution emissions and carbon emissions originate from fossil energy consumption, industrial production, transportation, residential life and other activities, resulting in a low CERC in cities with high environmental pollution emissions. Such situations are not conducive to realizing synergies between pollution reduction and carbon reduction. Third, the average contribution of environmental pollution to the CERC score of cities was 15.26 %. The contributions to the scores of Qingyang, Shangluo, and Pingliang were 20.54 %, 19.56 %, and 19.26 %, respectively. It formulated the Shaanxi Province Pollution Reduction and Carbon Synergy Implementation Plan  to address high levels of environmental pollutants and carbon emissions. This proposal increased the centralized treatment rate of industrial wastewater, domestic wastewater and solid wastes in cities with serious pollutant emissions, proposed the use of cleaner energy sources in place of fossil fuels and reduced the cost of managing environmental pollution.  4.2 Spatial correlation characteristics on carbon emission reduction capacity 4.2.1 Overall network characteristics The modified gravity model was used to establish the gravity matrix of the CERC. The spatial correlation network structure of the CERC in 2010, 2014, 2017, and 2021 was mapped by running the “Netdraw ” plug in a visualization tool in Ucinet software (Fig. 8  ). The results showed that the CERC of the GPUA had a significant spatial correlation and is becoming increasingly close. The spatial correlation network structure showed a complex pattern of multiple flows and threads. The characteristics of the central city were remarkable, indicating that the spatial correlation structure of CERC was not merely a simple geographical proximity relationship, but rather a typical core-edge pattern. The number of network relationships increased from 26 in 2010 to 71 in 2021 (Fig. 9  ), the network density increased from 0.24 to 0.65. The network hierarchies decreased from 0.91 in 2010 to 0.40 in 2021, reflecting the increasing relevance and stability of the network and the strengthening of CERC interactions between cities. The network correlations were continuously 1, indicating a significant spatial correlation between the cities. The network efficiencies were continuously 0, indicating that the network was not dependent on a single or few nodes. This situation resulted from the implementation of the Development Plan for the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration , which led to a steady increase in the carrying capacity of the urban ecosystem, the effectiveness of air pollution control in the Fenwei Plain, and a marked improvement in the quality of the ecological environment of the Qinling Mountains. Enhancement of the network correlation of the spatial structure of CERC in UAs has promoted synergistic development among cities, which has facilitated the realization of SDG13.2 “Integrate climate change measures into policies and planning ”, SDG13.3 “Build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change ”, and SDG13.5 “Promote mechanisms to raise capacity for planning and management ”.  4.2.2 Individual network characteristics The results of Table 6   show that the mean value of the degree centrality of the spatial correlation network gradually increased from 2010 to 2021, indicating that the cities are becoming increasingly closely connected with each other. The degree centralities of Xi'an, Baoji, and Xianyang exceeded the average value of GPUA. Thus, they were essential components of the spatial correlation network, whereas Linfen was located on the network's edge of spatial correlation. This situation occurred because cities with higher CERC had comparative advantages in economic level, location and technological level. Additionally, these factors demonstrated good mobility between cities (Li et al., 2022 ). Xi'an, Xianyang and neighbouring cities were synergistically linked, the value range of betweenness centrality decreased overall, and each city tended to be balanced. The betweenness centrality of Xi'an, which consistently exceeded the average betweenness centrality of the GPUA, was a key node in the network and thus played a moderating and controlling role. Tongchuan, Linfen and Qingyang had lower betweenness centrality and weaker influence due to their relatively scarce resources. Closeness centrality was more balanced overall, with the mean value decreasing from 17.45 in 2010 to 13.45 in 2021. Weinan, Shangluo, Yuncheng, Linfen, Tianshui, Pingliang, and Qingyang, whose closeness centrality was consistently higher than the average value, had insufficient CERC, but a strong willingness to cooperate with other cities to reduce carbon emissions. This trait significantly strengthened their linkages with other cities, enabling them to serve as central actors in the network. The closeness centrality of Xi'an was always been the lowest, indicating that Xi'an had a high CERC, was not significantly influenced by other cities, and was a marginal actor. The resulting exacerbation of the spatial nonequilibrium of the CERC of UAs reflected the importance and role of carbon mitigation synergies from the side.   4.3 Driving factors of the spatial correlation on carbon emission reduction capacity The correlation test of the QAP model was conducted using Ucinet software. The results obtained after 5,000 random replacement calculations (Table 7  ) showed that the significance level test was passed by the correlation coefficients of the spatial correlation between seven variables and the CERC. Moreover, differences in economic level, technological level, industrial structure, urbanization level, waste disposal level and spatial adjacency were favourably associated with the development of spatial correlation, while energy intensity had a negative correlation. Using Ucinet software to randomize the data 5,000 times, the adjusted R2  was 0.591, indicating that the selected driving factors explained 59.1 % of the spatial correlation (Table 8  ). The results showed that, first, the spatial adjacency was considerably positive at the 5 % level, suggesting that the spatial correlation network structure was more significant for cities located close to one another. This situation was due to the strong resource agglomeration effect between geographically neighbouring cities, which reduced the cost and difficulty of the spatial transfer of low-carbon factors and facilitated agreements on joint environmental prevention and management. Second, the differences in economic level were significantly positive at the 1 % level, indicating that differences in economic level contributed significantly to spatial correlations. Thus, cities with high economic levels can realize carbon trading with cities with low economic levels under environmental constraints. Third, the differences in technological level and the differences in industrial structure were significantly positive at the 10 % level, indicating that the variability of technological level and industrial structure among cities promoted spatial correlation to some extent. Technological exchanges were more frequent between cities with large differences in technological level, while differences in industrial structure affected the structure of urban energy consumption, which in turn impacted spatial correlations. Fourth, differences in energy intensity and waste disposal level were significantly negative at the 10 % level, suggesting that differences in energy intensity and waste disposal level between cities were to some extent detrimental to the formation of spatial correlations. Because energy consumption and waste emissions have negative externalities, spatial spillovers from cities with lower levels were not readily accepted by cities with higher levels. Lastly, the regression coefficients of differences in urbanization level did not pass the significance test, indicating that the differences in urbanization level did not have a significant effect on the spatial correlation of CERC. The potential policy implication is that regulating differences between cities in terms of economic level, technological level, industrial structure, and waste disposal level can improve the spatial correlation network structure of CERC in UAs.   5 Discussion The nonequilibrium characteristics of the spatial distribution of the CERC in UAs have attracted great attention (Wang et al., 2024 ). Geographic factors (Nabernegg et al., 2019 ), resource endowments (Minunno et al., 2020 ), and differences of economic level and industrial structures (Suárez-Eiroa et al., 2021 ) have shaped the energy structure and industrial layout of different cities, which are difficult to adjust in a short time period, resulting in the nonequilibrium of the CERC in UAs (Geng et al., 2019 ). At the same time, the synergistic effect of reducing environmental pollution and carbon emissions is attracting increased attention (Wu et al., 2024 ). However, the stability of the core-edge structure of UAs does not reflect in the radiation and driving effect of the central city on the neighbouring cities. The coordinated carbon emission reduction actions of UAs have not been agreed upon. Existing research has shown that the construction of and improvements in transportation and communication networks, the implementation of corresponding carbon emission reduction policies, and the gradual improvement in the carbon trading market system are all conducive to synergistic carbon emission reduction in UAs (Cai et al., 2022 ). However, due to the negative externality of carbon emissions and the shortcomings of the carbon compensation mechanism, there is an asymmetry between the cost and benefit of governance among cities. Furthermore, some cities lack the motivation to reduce carbon emissions (Zheng & Ye, 2022 ). Notably, the density and layout of cities within UAs, as well as urban functions, are beginning to influence the regional implementation of carbon mitigation actions through energy management and scheduling strategies. These developments enable spatial interconnections and synergistic optimization, including energy systems and ecological conditions, to provide an important analytical perspective for enhancing the climate resilience of UAs (Perera et al., 2021 ). In response to the transboundary flow of carbon emissions from UAs in the short term, it is clear that restructuring the energy mix is more advantageous than restructuring the spatial mix, especially since electricity-exporting cities will face air pollution and water scarcity problems that access these electricity resources (Liu et al., 2022 ). However, in the long run, free-riding behaviour  has weakened the overall carbon emission reduction effect and exacerbated the imbalance of the CERC of UAs, which has severely impeded the realization of the SDGs (Molinos-Senante et al., 2022 ). Constructing a synergistic pathway of carbon emission reduction for UAs from a spatial correlation perspective is the key to realizing the SDGs. The analysis results of factors driving the spatial correlation of CERC capacity show that differences in economic level, technological level, energy intensity, industrial structure and spatial adjacency significantly affect the spatial correlation of CERC. The finding provides a scientific basis for UAs to achieve SDG 7 by optimizing the energy structure and increasing the share of clean energy (Madurai Elavarasan et al., 2022 ). To achieve SDG 13 by integrating the characteristics of the spatial correlation network structure of UAs into the planning of emission reduction frameworks and to explore effective policies to mitigate climate change (Zhou et al., 2024 ). Unlike the results of existing research, those of this study indicate that domestic waste disposal level can reflect the strength of urban environmental protection to a certain extent. Furthermore, they show that waste emissions, such as carbon emissions, have negative externalities and that large differences in waste disposal level between cities are not conducive to the formation of spatial correlations. These correlations have not been considered in existing research. Moreover, in existing research, urbanization level has a significant driving effect on carbon emissions (Wang et al., 2021b ). However, the effect of differences in urbanization level is not significant in the study. The reason is that the influence of the urbanization level on spatial correlation is a complex and long-term issue involving many factors. With the accelerating development of urbanization, it is difficult to measure urbanization level by considering only the population factor (Zhang et al., 2023 ). There are several limitations of this study. First, the construction of the CERC indicator system is linked with SDG 7 and SDG 13. However, not all SDGs and their subgoals are covered. Furthermore, a detailed discussion of the correlation between the indicators is lacking, adding a correlation analysis would enhance the persuasive power. Second, in the process of data acquisition, some data was missing. Thus, the use of municipal data related to the year-on-year provincial data conversion is not precise enough. Lastly, due to the limitations of the number of cities and the simple structure of monocentric UAs, the spatial correlation characterization included only overall network analysis and individual network analysis. It did not classify the city types through spatial clustering analysis, thus limiting the universality of the results for different UAs. Suggestions for future research directions are offered. First, a detailed discussion of the correlation between indicators should be provided. The more accurate data should be obtained in light of the actual situation of the study area, emphasized the guiding role of the SDGs and improving the universality of the indicator system. Second, city types are classified through spatial clustering analysis. The countermeasures for different city types are proposed to improve the applicability of the research results. Third, the impact of differences in urbanization level on spatial linkages is explored from various perspectives such as land, economy and society to provide more spatial transmission paths for synergistic enhancement of CERC. Lastly, it will discuss the issue of cost-benefit imbalances between regions that result from free-riding behaviour  and the more complex issue of intergenerational distribution of rights and obligations. It explores fairer and more effective paths to carbon emission reduction.  6 Conclusion and countermeasures The CERC of the GPUA from 2010 to 2021 is assessed and the characteristics of the spatial correlation network structure of the CERC and its driving factors are explored. The main points are as follows. Firstly, the CERC of GPUA gradually increased from 1.726 in 2010 to 2.063 in 2021, with a growth rate of 19.52 %. The contributions of the social development, technology and carbon sinks, and economic growth dimensions are high in cities with high CERC. The energy consumption, carbon emissions, and environmental pollution dimensions of cities with low CERC strongly contribute to the CERC. The mean contribution of the environmental pollution dimension to the CERC score reaches 15.26 %. The CERC of UAs is characterized by nonequilibrium. The CERC of the cities close to the central city improves faster, indicating the potential for synergistic carbon governance of the CERC of UAs. It expanded the horizons of UAs in realizing the goal of carbon emission reduction. Secondly, the CERC of cities within UAs has significant spatial correlation and are becoming increasingly close. The spatial correlation network structure has progressed beyond mere geographical proximity and has formed a core-edge pattern. The overall and individual network characteristics indicate a growing network relevance and a gradual increase in stability. The number of network relationships increased from 26 in 2010 to 71 in 2021. Network density increased from 0.24 to 0.65. The network efficiency decreased from 0.91 in 2010 to 0.40 in 2021. The central city plays a regulating and controlling role in the network. The central actor cities are highly willing to cooperate with other cities in carbon emission reduction, indicating that improving the spatial network relevance of the CERC will be conducive to realizing the synergistic governance of carbon emission reduction among cities. Lastly, spatial adjacency and the differences in economic level, technological level, energy intensity, industrial structure, and waste treatment level significantly affect the spatial correlation network structure of CERC, while the effect of differences in urbanization level is not significant. The explanatory power of these driving factors on the spatial correlation of the CERC is 59.1 %. The finding provides a scientific basis for determining the focus point for improving the CERC from a spatial correlation perspective. Thus, carbon reduction countermeasures are proposed for policymakers, urban planners, and other stakeholders based on the SDG 7 and SDG 13 subgoals (Fig. 10  ). Firstly, industrial subsidies, tax exemptions and other policies should be used to promote and support the research and application of low-carbon technologies in low-carbon cities and to improve cross-regional cooperation and exchanges in the low-carbon technology industry. The climate-resilient city pilots and climate finance pilots should be supported through environmental tax regulation. According to the characteristics of the spatial correlation network structure between cities, the construction of high-speed railroads and urban light railways should be accelerated to improve the transportation structure of UAs. The “one-hour commuting circle ” can be constructed between the central city and the main urban areas of neighbouring cities to realize the colocation of public services. Local governments by way of legislation should be required to regularly publicize reports on the progress of carbon governance and promote an incentive system for carbon emission reduction based on carbon footprint measurements. Furthermore, they should construct carbon trading systems to facilitate the realization of SDG7.4, SDG7.5, SDG13.1 and SDG13.4. Secondly, planning for important urban ecological functional zones and ecological corridors, strengthening public governance of urban forests and greening, and increasing green spaces such as green corridors, urban parks, public open spaces and habitats for wild species in urban renewal should be undertaken. The construction of eco-functional zones and the development of eco-industries in cities benefiting from carbon offsetting should be promoted. The accounting system for carbon sinks should be improved, urban green credit products and services should be innovated. The credit operations for ecological products, green products. The carbon trading should be carried out to promote the realization of SDG13.1, SDG7.1, and SDG7.5. Lastly, according to the city characteristics of the industrial structure and local resource endowment, the utilization of renewable and green energy should increase. The efficiency of energy utilization should improve to facilitate the realization of SDG7.2 and SDG7.3. The scholars, the entrepreneurs, the public and other stakeholders should be encouraged to participate in urban planning hearings, public participation in urban planning and construction should be enhanced. The coordinated mechanism for multiparty monitoring of urban carbon governance should be formed. The capture of environmental information, such as carbon emissions, should be encouraged through new media methods and the use of environmental public interest litigation. Such actions can promote specialized solutions to specific issues and thus contribute to the realization of SDG13.2, SDG13.3 and SDG13.5.
