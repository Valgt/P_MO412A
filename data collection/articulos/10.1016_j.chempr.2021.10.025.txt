Solving the wicked problems posed the UN sustainable development goals requires systematic solutions. It is through the power and potential of green chemistry that these synergistic and reinforcing solutions can be developed.    Main text According to Rittel and Webber (1973), a wicked problem is a one relevant to society that is difficult or impossible to solve due to incomplete or contradictory knowledge, the number of people and opinions involved, the large economic burden, and the interconnected nature of these problems with other  problems (e.g., embedded in a system).1   Wicked problems are the converse of hard but ordinary problems, which are tractable in a finite time period by applying standard techniques. Not only do conventional processes and reductionist thinking fail to tackle wicked problems, but they could exacerbate situations by generating undesirable and unintended consequences.2   This description can certainly fit many, if not all, of the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs)3   because their complexity is almost as daunting as their human consequence. Although there have been previous discussions in this journal4   as well as in other venues about the important role that chemistry can play in addressing the SDGs,5  , 6   it is worth exploring how the entire chemical enterprise can be engaged to maximize its positive impact by exploiting the very complexity and “wickedness” of the SDGs. Cascading non-linear problems There are simple problems that can be solved in a finite time period by applying standard techniques (e.g., clearing a clogged drain). These non-wicked problems are wonderfully uninteresting and sadly do not reflect the challenges posed by the SDGs. The issues of poverty, health, water, climate, and the others are systems problems that require systems thinking to address them. These systemic problems are difficult to predict in that they are non-linear, have feedback mechanisms, are adaptive, and have emergent behavior.7   Problems of this type—“cascading non-linear problems”—can originate from specific, discreet actions that can bring about not just a single adverse outcome, but rather many adverse outcomes, and from each of those resultant adverse outcomes some number of additional adverse outcomes are created, and so on. This phenomenon is perhaps best illustrated by one of the greatest challenges of our time: climate change. One can view the main driver of climate change as the burning of fossil fuels that propelled the industrial revolution and continues to this day. This, the burning of fossil fuels, can be considered a specific, discreet action or event for the purposes of this discussion (Figure 1  ). The consequence of burning fossil fuels is obviously the increased levels of CO2  in the atmosphere, the addition of other pollutants and particulates in the air, and the increased concentrations of CO2  our oceans and other water bodies. These adverse outcomes yield greater global average temperatures, lower air quality, and ocean and lake acidification. From these factors emerge changes in habitat, increased regional droughts, increased frequency and intensity of storms, sea level rise, and so on. The consequences then cascade to crop failures, wildfires, coastal flooding, spread of disease vectors, millions of respiratory deaths each year, environmental refugees, immigration stresses, political conflict, supply chain disruption, economic losses, species extinction, and much more. When taken together, these interconnected systemic crises are unfathomably complex despite their common singular origin. Although this example of climate change is perhaps the most easily illustrated of the cascading non-linear problems, the same exercise can be done with virtually any of the major challenges in the SDGs (e.g., water, food, poverty). Further, there are clearly intersections between the complex system of one SDG and the complex system of another. Is this complexity inherently tragic, or is it our lack of systems thinking that contributes to our seeming inability to gain traction in addressing these problems? Rather, it could be that exploiting the complexity and interactions within and between these systems could be one of the most powerful tool in developing solutions to these wicked problems.  Cascading non-linear solutions One can certainly argue that there is nothing inherent about non-linear cascades that requires them to be negative, tragic, or catastrophic. This construct is simply a description of how discreet actions or events can drive emergent behavior and multiply outcomes regardless of whether they are desirable or undesirable. With the above example of climate change, we have seen that in the absence of thoughtful systems design, extremely adverse consequences can result. So the question becomes, is it possible to create cascading non-linear solutions through thoughtful systems thinking and design? For the purposes of this journal, the most relevant specific question is, how can chemistry be used to create cascading non-linear solutions that are most relevant to addressing one or more of the UN SDGs?  Green chemistry for the creation of cascading non-linear solutions The field of green chemistry is celebrating its 30th  anniversary,8   and its recent legacy has been marked by breakthroughs and innovations that have been recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee.9  , 10   With all of the achievements, both scientific and commercial, there is an opportunity, perhaps even an obligation, to reflect on whether there is potential to be even more strategic about how green chemistry tools, approaches, advances, and practitioners can be engaged in solving society’s greatest challenges. To accomplish this task, it is useful to view the challenges within their systems context and ask a series of questions:1. Where in the system are the main drivers or enablers of the most egregious or pressing negative consequences?  2. Can these drivers and enablers of negative consequence be mitigated or adapted to break the undesirable cascade of adverse outcomes?  3. Can new drivers and/or enablers be initiated that will result in a cascade of intentional and desirable outcomes?    Although the questions are simple, the answers are likely to be extremely difficult to identify and implement given the complexity of the challenges and the ability to foresee and avoid unintended consequences. However, utilizing systems thinking and systems design has been shown to be effective in developing cascading non-linear solutions to wicked problems,11   such as the SDGs.12   Coupling these strategies with the power and potential of green chemistry has significant potential to increase the design, development, and implementation of cascading non-linear solutions for maximal impact and effectiveness.13   So what would this look like? In the area of climate change, we can crosswalk some of the potential research areas (some currently being pursued and others that are under- or unexplored) with an understanding of their impact of shifting from cascading negative consequences to positive outcomes. For example:Because it is known that the burning of fossil fuels is a driver of climate change, the green chemistry efforts that are developing alternative energy sources (e.g., advanced photovoltaics,14   next generation biofuels,15   advanced material design for wind turbines,16   etc.) are aligned with eliminating that driver from the system. In contrast, research focused on making petroleum refineries more efficient enables greater profitability and supports the further production and exploitation of fossil resources. From a systems perspective, although efficiency is often viewed as a positive, if it strengthens or enhances pathways toward the negative consequences of climate change, it would be considered part of the cascading non-linear problem.17    The development of energy storage systems is necessary infrastructure for the full realization of renewable energy needed to move away from fossil fuels. One vibrant area of chemical research is the development of “green” hydrogen through the catalytic oxidation of water via wind- or solar-generated electricity.18  , 19   Because renewable energy storage is an enabling node in the system that displaces fossil resources, it is an important target in breaking the negative cascade.  Carbon dioxide capture, sequestration, and utilization is an extremely active area of green chemistry research and is an example of not displacing the driver of the cascading non-linear problem but rather breaking one of the links in the cascading chain that results in negative consequences. By not preventing carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere or hydrosphere, many of the negative consequences can be obviated. The systems questions then become whether this modification in the system has removed all of the negative consequences or just some of them, or whether this change has resulted in cascading positive consequences.    The closer the interventions are to the origins of the problem (in the case of climate change, it would be the very paradigm of burning of fossil fuels), the more fundamental and positive the change will be in seeing cascading benefits.11   Although it is also true that interventions that are far removed from the drivers will unlikely have cascading positive effects, the excellent research in developing hurricane resistant roofing materials, more efficient air conditioners to deal with future heat waves, or more effective anti-viral medicines for dealing with increased animal borne disease vectors are tremendously important in combatting the growing number of human crises that need to be addressed urgently and in the immediate term for the benefit of humanity. However, it must be recognized through systems thinking and design that these efforts are not preventing the disease but merely treating its tragic symptoms.  Green chemistry as part of the larger system Albert Einstein once said that “the right to search for the truth implies also a duty; one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be the truth.”20   One of the truths that I have recognized and must not conceal over the course of thirty years as a green chemist is that scientific understanding, discovery, invention, and innovation are all essential and necessary to meeting our sustainable development goals and yet are profoundly insufficient. With all of the achievements of green chemistry over the past three decades that are directly applicable to sustainable energy, agriculture, infrastructure, climate change, health and well-being, water quality and quantity, and so much more, there is still the need to bring these inventions to the scale and with the urgency that is required to meet the humanitarian needs contained in the UN SDGs. In order for that to be achieved, scientists and engineers will need to work with partners across the academy, government, industry, non-governmental organizations, and civil society. In 2019, there was the celebration of the 150th  anniversary of the Periodic Table of the Elements. As a commemoration and in tribute, there was introduced “The Periodic Table of Green and Sustainable Chemistry.”21   This table elucidated not merely the role of green chemistry and engineering in addressing the “Humanitarian Elements” as outlined by the SDGs but also the other elements that are needed including new economic models, policies, conceptual frameworks, metrics, and tools. (Figure 2  ). Only through the bonding of these elements to form new metaphorical molecules that represent new collaborations, new collaborative institutions and organizations, new business models and investment schemes, and new methods of measuring and communicating the importance and impact of science and technology will we be able to take the breakthroughs of green chemistry and engineering and address the complex systems problems that are at the heart of the SDGs. Rather than trying to treat each tragic symptom of an unsustainable world, green chemistry and green engineering in partnership with the other “elements” can create cascading non-linear solutions to some of our greatest challenges.
