                  This work combines a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize a methanol synthesis plant for multiple objectives. The proposed method begins by developing and validating the model for the methanol synthesis involving the recycling of unreacted gas stream into the methanol reactor feed. The data generated using this model is used to develop a GRNN-based surrogate model to expedite the evaluation of fitness values for the optimization algorithm. The objective functions considered for simultaneous optimization are minimizing the total energy cost per unit of energy input (TEC), maximizing overall resource utilization (R), and minimizing CO2-gram equivalent emissions per unit of energy input (EPEI). Pareto optimal solutions are obtained for three bi-and one tri-objective optimization case studies using the GRNN-assisted multi-objective optimization (GRNNAMOO) method. The developed GRNNAMOO approach reduces the computational time from multiple days to a few seconds for all case study scenarios. For the tri-objective optimization case, the operating point selected using multi-criteria decision-making achieves 84.37% of R, 10.45 $/GJ of TEC, and an EPEI value of 81.34 gCO2eq/MJ. These results represent 7.05% higher R, 0.34 $/GJ lower TEC, and 0.82 gCO2eq/MJ lower EPEI than the Aspen plus simulation results. Further, the carbon footprint values obtained are significantly lower than 110 gCO2eq/MJ reported for modern methanol plants for nearly the same R and TEC values. The proposed approach aligns with the United Nations' sustainability development goals by lowering energy costs and promoting sustainable energy through improved environmental sustainability in methanol production plants.

This work combines a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize a methanol synthesis plant for multiple objectives. The proposed method begins by developing and validating the model for the methanol synthesis involving the recycling of unreacted gas stream into the methanol reactor feed. The data generated using this model is used to develop a GRNN-based surrogate model to expedite the evaluation of fitness values for the optimization algorithm. The objective functions considered for simultaneous optimization are minimizing the total energy cost per unit of energy input (TEC), maximizing overall resource utilization (R), and minimizing CO2 -gram equivalent emissions per unit of energy input (EPEI). Pareto optimal solutions are obtained for three bi-and one tri-objective optimization case studies using the GRNN-assisted multi-objective optimization (GRNNAMOO) method. The developed GRNNAMOO approach reduces the computational time from multiple days to a few seconds for all case study scenarios. For the tri-objective optimization case, the operating point selected using multi-criteria decision-making achieves 84.37% of R, 10.45 $/GJ of TEC, and an EPEI value of 81.34 gCO2 eq/MJ. These results represent 7.05% higher R, 0.34 $/GJ lower TEC, and 0.82 gCO2 eq/MJ lower EPEI than the Aspen plus simulation results. Further, the carbon footprint values obtained are significantly lower than 110 gCO2 eq/MJ reported for modern methanol plants for nearly the same R and TEC values. The proposed approach aligns with the United Nations' sustainability development goals by lowering energy costs and promoting sustainable energy through improved environmental sustainability in methanol production plants.   Graphical Abstract       Keywords Modeling  Neural-network  Optimization  Methanol-synthesis  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction Methanol is a colorless, volatile, light, and flammable liquid, represented by the chemical formula CH3 OH. In 1994, Nobel Prize winner George A. Olah introduced the concept of the methanol economy (Edlund, 2011 ). Currently, the global demand for methanol stands at approximately 70 million tons per year, with a steady growth rate of 6â8% annually, and it is projected to exceed 90 million tons per year soon (âMethanol Market, Latest Global Industry Size Forecast Report,â 2023 ).  The demand for methanol consumption is primarily driven by the production of formaldehyde accounting for 30%, followed by the production of MTBE at 12%, the production of fuels at 12%, and the production of acetic acid at 10% in mass units. Furthermore, approximately 6% of methanol is used to produce DME (Rafiee, 2020 ). Methanol is widely regarded as a cleaner fuel mainly because of its significantly reduced emissions and lower environmental impact when compared to traditional fossil fuels (Dalena et al., 2018 ). When combusted, methanol produces fewer greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, significant contributors to climate change. Additionally, it generates lower levels of harmful pollutants and particulate matter, which are responsible for smog formation and respiratory issues. Its versatility as a fuel also allows it to be used in various applications such as heating, cooking, powering vehicles, and generating electricity. As a result, the adoption of methanol as an energy source has the potential to significantly reduce carbon footprint and foster a transition towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy future. The accumulation of greenhouse gases by excessive use of fossil fuels, particularly carbon emissions is resulting in global warming. This is leading to climate change which in turn results in increased respiration and cardiovascular diseases along with other calamities. To prevent a rise in global surface temperatures exceeding 2 Â°C by 2050, it is imperative to reduce CO2  levels by a minimum of 50% (Wilberforce et al., 2021 ). In response, the international community has rallied behind the Paris Climate Agreement, aiming to restrict global warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, necessitating urgent and substantial reductions in GHG emissions (Falkner, 2016; RennÃ©, 2022 ). During the summit meeting, the United Nations (UN) introduced the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) after extensive consultations involving a wide range of stakeholders, including international businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), policymakers, and civil society. Methanol can play a crucial role in achieving some of these SDGs (Swain and Karimu, 2020 ). It can provide affordable energy access (SDG 7). Further, being a clean energy carrier, it has the potential to displace fossil fuels, making it a crucial contributor to climate action and environmental sustainability (SDG 13). Modeling, simulation, and optimization are essential for achieving the SDGs in chemical processes (Martinez-Hernandez et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2018 ) including methanol synthesis plant (Aly et al., 2022; Li et al., 2020 ). These approaches support the UN's efforts to enhance energy efficiency, reduce emissions, conserve resources, and improve sustainability of the industrial operations. However, conventional modeling, simulation, and optimization approaches often require large computational efforts and time which render them ineffective in real applications. Also, these have limitations in handling uncertainties (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2021). Contrastingly, recent studies have shown that the use of machine learning (ML) based surrogate models trained using simulation or actual plant data for prediction or optimization can effectively alleviate this problem (Wu et al., 2021 ). One of such commonly used machine learning models is artificial neural networks (ANN) which is used extensively for prediction and optimization of process applications. Kancherla et al. (2021)  used ANNs to predict the performance of an air separation unit based on data generated by the Aspen Plus simulation. The optimization with ANN surrogate was found to be more accurate and faster than that without ANN. Wolday and Ramteke (2023)  utilized genetic algorithms (GA) and neural networks to optimize the methanol distillation process to minimize capital and operational costs. The study efficiently employed ANN for multi-objective optimization (MOO) to obtain optimal Pareto optimal solutions in significantly reduced computation time. Ashraf and Dua (2023)  used ANN and SVM models to optimize the post-combustion carbon capture process. Through extensive hyperparameter tuning, they identified the optimal conditions for capturing CO2  from flue gas, a crucial advancement in the pursuit of carbon neutrality. Inapakurthi and Mitra (2023)  utilized different machine-learning models for faster multi-objective surrogate optimization in energy-intensive processes, reducing computation time by approximately 79.32% while maintaining prediction accuracy. Mahadeva et al. (2022)  used ANN to model and analyze desalination plant performance, achieving 99.4% R2  and 0.003 MSE for accurate predictions. Nadda et al. (2023)  highlighted the superior spatial learning capabilities of deep neural networks (DNN) in predicting fluidized bed hydrodynamics, reducing computational requirements without compromising accuracy. These studies on surrogate modeling are reviewed extensively in the literature (Saini et al., 2023; Subraveti et al., 2019; Al Ani et al., 2023 ). Motivated by the above studies, a novel approach of generalized regression neural network (GRNN) based MOO is proposed in this work for the methanol synthesis process. In this approach, GRNN is used for developing the surrogate model of the process primarily due to the following advantages over ANN (Xue et al., 2022). It can map strong nonlinear behavior and requires relatively lower adjusting parameters. It is computationally less complex and can have a faster learning speed which is a key requirement in industrial applications. Also, it is robust in converging to the global minima which is significantly important in forecasting applications (MartÃ­nez et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023 ). Since the real industrial data is not available currently, an Aspen Plus simulator data is used to train the GRNN model. However, if the real industrial data becomes available then this can be used directly or in combination with simulation data to develop an effective surrogate model. The trained model is then used for multi-objective optimization. An elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used for MOO primarily due to its ability to solve non-linear, multi-solution, and multi-objective optimization formulations effectively for industrial process applications (Ramteke et al., 2021 ). The coupling of GRNN with NSGA-II for MOO is referred to as GRNNAMOO. The developed algorithm is used for simultaneously minimizing the total energy cost per unit of energy input, maximizing the overall resource utilization, and minimizing CO2 -gram equivalent emissions per unit of energy input for the methanol synthesis process. Satisfying these objectives leads to methanol production more cheaply and cleanly and thus contributes towards achieving SDG7, SDG12, and SDG13, respectively. Furthermore, the Aspen Plus methanol synthesis model has been enhanced by incorporating a recycle stream effluent, as illustrated in  Fig. 1 , within the FL2 block flash separator, to conserve feed resources. This recycling approach offers numerous benefits, including improved process efficiency, resource conservation, cost-effectiveness, and reduced environmental impact by minimizing waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions. This modification offers a promising opportunity to address the SDGs. In summary, the modification of recycling unreacted effluent gas outputs in methanol synthesis holds the potential to address the reduction of total energy cost per unit of energy input (TEC), improve overall resource utilization (R), and minimize CO2 -gram equivalent emissions per unit of energy input (EPEI). The key novelties of this work are as follows:â¢ An Aspen Plus model for methanol and DME production with recycling  of unreacted gases is developed.  â¢ The developed model is used for training the GRNN surrogate to improve the reliability of the application.  â¢ The GRNN-based surrogate model is used for MOO to minimize TEC, maximize R, and minimize EPEI, simultaneously.    The remaining work is arranged as follows. The methanol production process is described in Section 2 . The multi-objective optimization formulation of the process is described in Section 3 . Results and discussion are described in Section 4  followed by the conclusions in Section 5 .  2 Methanol synthesis process Using Aspen Plus 12.0 software modeling and simulation of syngas conversion into methanol is effectively achieved under various operating conditions. It utilizes Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong equations of state for thermodynamic calculation in simulating the methanol reaction and separation processes. The impact of changes in composition, temperature, and pressure of syngas on the rate of formation of methanol is included through reaction kinetics, which is crucial for process optimization. The essential kinetic reactions involved in methanol synthesis are given below.(1) CO + 2 H  2   â CH  3   OH , â H  298  O   = â 90.55 kJ  mol        (2) CO  2   + 3 H  2   â CH  3   OH + H  2   O , â H  298  O   = â 49.43 kJ  mol        (3) CO  2   + H  2   â CO + H  2   O , â H  298  O   = 41.12 kJ  mol        (4) 2 CH  3   OH â CH  3   O CH  3   + H  2   O , â H  298  O   = 256.600 kJ  mol         The base model of this methanol synthesis plant was simulated and validated using the findings from (Scott and Adams, 2018 ), as detailed in our own published paper (Wolday et al., 2023 ). To build upon this work, we conducted an extension of the study, employing a machine learning-supported MOO approach. This involved modifying the base model by introducing a recycling system for unreacted gases separated at flash unit FL2, as depicted in Fig. 1 . This recycled stream contains mixtures of unreacted synthesis gas components, including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and traces of methane, and is flared if not recycled. Recycling these unreacted gases within the methanol synthesis process is important for several reasons. Firstly, it minimizes wastage and mitigates environmental impact by maximizing resource utilization. Secondly, it boosts process efficiency, ensuring optimal conversion rates that amplify methanol production. Lastly, reusing unreacted gases reduces costs by decreasing extra raw materials and energy utilities. This contributes to the economic sustainability and resource management of the plant. Moreover, the modification of the recycle stream (Fig. 1 ) redirects it to the methanol feed reactor, resulting in a total flow rate of 584.708âkg/hr. The component flow rates of H2 O, N2 , CO2 , H2 , and CO within this stream are 2.495âkg/hr, 2.942âkg/hr, 776.531âkg/hr, 103.598âkg/hr, and 60.556âkg/hr, respectively. After the reactant conversion in the MeOH Reactor to valuable products, the splitter2 block splits the distillate product stream from the FC2 column into two separate streams. The first stream of 659.947âkg/hr of methanol is used for DME production, whereas the remaining stream of 990.407âkg/hr exchanges heat and then mixed with 2247.923âkg/hr of methanol from the FL2 block stream in mixer4 block. This process yields a final product of 12697.285âkg/hr of methanol at the top (stream: Methanol), along with 6.977âkg/hr of H2 O and 329.847âkg/hr of DME (stream:21â1). Furthermore, all CO, CO2  gas emissions, water vapors, and trace hydrogen are recycled, resulting in zero values of the effluents in all the final products. Additionally, the results indicate a remarkable purity of 99.945% of methanol with 00.0975% H2 O. On the other hand, the bottom waste stream (stream: to wastewater treatment) exhibits nearly 0.953% wastewater product with a 0.047 mass fraction of methanol and negligible mass fraction of DME. The results demonstrate successful reactor performance and noteworthy process separation efficiency achieved through the Aspen Plus process simulator. Additionally, the output stream results demonstrating the improved methanol and DME production rate achieved through this recycling approach are presented in Tables S1 and S2 of the supplementary material.  3 Multi-objective optimization problem formulation To operate the methanol synthesis process most optimally, three meaningful objectives are formulated. The first objective is the minimization of the total energy cost per unit of energy input (TEC). This objective ensures methanol production with the cheapest energy options available. TEC is defined as follows:(5) TEC USD  MJ      = ( â  ( C  i    Ã E  i   ) )      where i  is the equipment name such as heat exchangers, distillation columns, and compressors block in the plant, E  i     is the corresponding amount of energy consumed, and C  i     is the associated cost factor. Similarly, the second objective focuses on maximizing the overall resource utilization (R). It seeks to maximize resource efficiency by reducing both raw material consumption and waste generation. According to a comprehensive guide on capacity utilization in manufacturing industries (âCapacity Utilization: A Complete Guide,â 2023 ), a utilization range of 85â100% is generally considered suitable for most industries and economic processes. This range signifies efficient resource utilization. While some industries can operate at 70â80% utilization and occasionally reach 100%, sustaining maximum utilization at all times is unrealistic. Hence, an existing utilization rate of 85% is regarded as excellent value. This rate is particularly ideal in most chemical industries. To achieve this target, an overall resource utilization (R) is formulated as follows:(6) R ( % ) = MEOHFINAL  ( Syngas  Feed  Materials ) â ( Waste  Generation )      Ã 100      In this equation, R represents the overall resource utilization, encompassing raw material consumption and waste generation. Since this work is focused on methanol production, only methanol is considered for calculating the resource utilization. MEOHFINAL in kg/hr represents the desired output process stream, while syngas feed materials (FEEDIN) in kg/hr and waste generation in kg/hr are the input and output streams, respectively, in the methanol synthesis plant depicted in Fig. 1 . The objective is to maximize the overall value derived from raw material consumption and waste generation, thereby fostering sustainable practices and effective resource management. Finally, the third objective involves minimizing CO2 -gram equivalent emissions per unit of energy input (EPEI). The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the carbon footprint of the methanol plant. This objective is formulated using CO2 -gram equivalent emissions denoted as E and energy input as Q (MJ). The calculation of E considers all greenhouse gases collectively referred to as GHG, and it relies on the associated greenhouse gas emissions factors (EF) for each gas emitted during the methanol production process. Thus, the mathematical expression for determining the CO2  gram equivalent emissions (E) per unit of energy input (Q) can be expressed as follows:(7) E = EFCO  2   Ã CO  2   + EFGHG Ã GHG       where EFCO  2     is the emissions factor for CO2  (in gCO2 eq/MJ), CO  2     is the amount of CO2  emissions (in grams) from process streams, EFGHG   is the emissions factor for other greenhouse gases (in gCO2 eq/MJ), and GHG   is the amount of other (i.e., N2 , CH4 , H2 O vapor, etc.) greenhouse gas emissions (in grams) from process streams. The specific values of 5.595âg/MJ and 0.85 (dimensionless) are used for the emissions factors EFCO  2     and EFGHG   as per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)-Rule-E9â5711. In addition, the heat duty inputs for the process equipment are formulated as follows:(8) Q MJ    =  â n = 1   R  n          where R  n     corresponds to the energy inputs rate associated with unit process equipment, n , in (MJ). Those energy inputs are obtained from the Aspen plus model. Therefore, the objective of minimizing CO2  gram Equivalent Emissions per unit of energy input (EPEI  ) can be achieved by combining Eqs. (7) and (8) . Minimizing the EPEI   is expressed as minimizing the ratio E / Q    as follows:(9) EPEI ( gCO 2 eq / MJ ) = E  Q            Based on the sensitivity analysis using Aspen Plus, six decision variables that significantly influence the objective functions are identified for multi-objective optimization. These are given as follows:1) RT (Â°C): Reactor Temperature in MeOHReactor block  2) RP (bar): Reactor Pressure in MeOHReactor block  3) RR1 (Mol): Reflux ratio in the FC2 block,  4) PFC (bar): Pressure in FC1 column,  5) FFI (kg/hr): Inlet Feed flow in Syngas stream,  6) RGR (kg/hr): Recycle gas rate refers to the rate at which unreacted gases are recycled back into the reactor.    Further, the purity of methanol is constrained to be greater than 98.5% as per Methanol Institute (MI) purity standards and the methanol and DME recoveries are constrained at 95%. These values are selected based on common industrial practices. Further, the bounds on decision variables are selected based on standard operating ranges used in industrial operations (Ateka et al., 2017; Kiss et al., 2016; Marcos et al., 2022; Smitshuysen et al., 2020; Tidona et al., 2013 ). The complete multi-objective optimization problem formulation is given as follows: Objective functions:1) Minimization of Total Energy Cost: minTEC       2) Maximize Overall Resource Utilization: maxR       3) Minimize CO2 -gram Equivalent Emissions per Unit of Energy Input: minEPEI         Decision variable bounds:1) 200 â¤ RT â¤ 400  2) 10 â¤ RP â¤ 100  3) 4 â¤ RR1 â¤ 10  4) 10 â¤ PFC â¤ 25  5) 10580 â¤ FFI â¤ 25000  6) 100 â¤ RGR â¤ 500    Constraints:1) Methanol purity: x_MeOHP â¥ 0.985,  2) Methanol Recovery: x_MeOHR â¥ 0.95,  3) DME purity: x_DMEP â¥ 0.95.    Four distinct cases are studied with different combinations of objectives for optimizing the methanol synthesis process. Case 1 is a two-objective optimization problem in which TEC is minimized and R is maximized, simultaneously. Case 2 is a two-objective optimization problem in which both TEC and EPEI are minimized simultaneously. Case 3 is a two-objective optimization problem in which R is maximized and EPEI is minimized, simultaneously. However, Case 4 is a three-objective optimization problem where TEC is minimized, R is maximized, and EPEI is minimized, simultaneously. In all four cases, a common set of decision variables, constraints, and bounds are used as given above.  4 GRNN assisted multi-objective optimization algorithm In this study, the GRNN surrogate model is coupled with the NSGA-II algorithm to optimize the methanol synthesis process. The primary goal is to improve computing efficiency by employing surrogate models to approximate computationally expensive simulations. This approach allows for swift evaluations, enhancing the NSGA-II algorithm's performance in MOO. The development of the GRNN surrogate (i.e., data generation, data pre-processing, model training, model evaluation) is explained next. 4.1 Development of GRNN surrogate The GRNN surrogate is developed using the Aspen Plus simulation data. For this purpose, a dataset of 100 samples is generated from the developed Aspen Plus simulation model. The Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method, a stratified Monte Carlo (MC) technique, was employed to generate the dataset. Using this method, samples of correlated decision variables and objective functions are generated with a Gaussian distribution. The LHS process involves selecting a sample size N from the decision variable space. Each variable's range is divided into N non-overlapping intervals, determined by equal probability sizes of 1 / N   . The resulting data encompasses the lower and upper bounds of both decision variables and objective functions. The corresponding output values from this process are then directed to the pre-processing stage. The pre-processing steps precede the actual model training. The MinMaxScaler is applied to normalize input data within a 0â1 range, ensuring uniform numerical scales and mitigating the influence of large-magnitude outliers. For normalization, the minimum and maximum values present in the dataset are used. Subsequently, the dataset undergoes a strategic division into training (70%), and test (30%) sets, comprising a total of 100 sample points. This approach fosters model learning from a diverse dataset and facilitates practical parameter tuning through validation. The testing set is an independent assessment, guarding against overfitting by evaluating the model on unseen data. This comprehensive pre-training process enhances the model's stability, robustness, and generalization capabilities. Next, the GRNN model is trained with a specific emphasis on adjusting weights and bias components of connections between neurons. Weights signify connection strengths, determining the impact of input signals, while bias components allow for fine-tuning of activation thresholds. The training process is initiated by inputting the preprocessed training data to optimize the model's ability to capture intricate patterns within the dataset. Choosing a suitable kernel function within the GRNN is critical, as it governs how the model perceives and learns the underlying data patterns. This careful selection contributes significantly to the GRNN's capacity to accurately represent the data. The radial basis function (RBF) kernel is utilized for this model training. RBF kernel is defined as K Z  i   , Z  j        , which measures the similarity between input vectors Z  i     and Z  j    .(10) K Z  i   , Z  j      = exp â Î³ Z  i   â Z  j      2            where Î³   (gamma) is a hyperparameter that controls the influence of each data point and Z  i   â Z  j      2     represents the squared Euclidean distance between input vectors Z  i     and Z  j     and is a scaling parameter that controls the width of the kernel. In GRNN, four feed-forward layers are used as shown in  Fig. 2 . The first, second, third, and fourth layers are used for input, pattern, summation, and output, respectively. The input vector, Z  i   = z  1 , i   , z  2 , i   , â¯ , z  n , i      T     comprising n  inputs (i.e., decision variables) for each sample (i  ) in the input layer. Each sample corresponds to a node in the Pattern layer. Thus, k  samples lead to k  nodes. Further, m  is the number of output variables Y  i   = o  1 , i   , o  2 , i   , â¯ , o  m , i      T      obtained as corresponding objective functions from the output layer. The overall network architecture of GRNN for test sample Z = z  1   , z  2   , â¯ , z  n      T      with output O = o  1   , o  2   , â¯ , o  m      T     is illustrated in Fig. 2  and the calculations are performed in different layers as follows:(11) P  i   = e  Z  i   â Z  j      2    2 Ï  2         ; i = 1 , 2 , â¯ , k      (12) S  A   = â i = 1  k   P  i         (13) S  WJ   = â i = 1  k   w  ij   P  i    ; j = 1 , 2 , â¯ , m      (14) o  j   = S  WJ    S  A           where Z  i     is the i  th     sample input to the pattern layer, P  i     is the output from i  th     node of the pattern layer, Ï   is the bandwidth factor used for smoothing. S  A     and S  WJ     represent the arithmetic and the weighted sums of inputs calculated at the first and remaining nodes of the summation layer. w  ij     is the weight of the connection between node i   in the pattern layer and node j   in the summation layer, and o  j     is the output of node j   of the output layer (Yang et al., 2023 ). The GRNN comprises an input layer for receiving input data, an output layer for regression output, and hidden layers that facilitate the learning process between the input and output layers. During the learning process, the GRNN determines the best weights of the input features at all nodes of the hidden and output layers to minimize prediction errors when the model is applied to test data. The model's performance is then assessed using two statistical metrics, with the error being measured through desired metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2 ). R2 , ranging from 0 to 1, offers insights into the model's accuracy in representing the data, while MSE quantifies the error in its predictions. Ultimately, higher R2  and lower MSE values indicate a higher accuracy of the GRNN model training throughout these steps. This leads to more precise predictions between the actual and predicted objective functions under the selected decision variable considerations. The trained model is tested on the test set. The evaluation phase validates the model's generalization capabilities, ensuring its effectiveness beyond the training set. A 5-fold cross-validation is used for testing the model.  4.2 Coupling GRNN with NSGA-II The flowchart explaining the coupling of GRNN with NSGA-II and Aspen Plus simulation is shown in  Fig. 3 . The developed GRNN surrogate is used for calculating the objective function values corresponding to the decision variable values generated by NSGA-II. Initially, a random population of decision variable sets is generated by NSGA-II. The corresponding objective function values are obtained using a GRNN surrogate. Based on the objective function values the initial solutions are ranked using a non-dominated ranking procedure. The population of these initial solutions then undergoes the tournament selection to produce a mating pool population. These solutions then undergo the genetic operation of crossover and mutation to produce the offspring solutions. These offspring solutions are then ranked together with the initial population to select the best solutions in the elitism operation. These elitist solutions are then used as starting solutions in the next generation and the cycle continues for the predefined maximum number of generations. After a maximum number of generations are performed, the elitist solutions obtained are the Pareto optimal solutions. The parameters included are a population size of 100, a crossover probability of 0.9, a mutation rate of 0.5, and a maximum number of generations equal to 200. These parameter values were selected based on relevant literature reviews conducted by (Sharma and Rangaiah, 2013; Singh et al., 2021 ). Further, the Pareto optimal solutions obtained are analyzed using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) which is a crucial technique for handling complex decisions with multiple objectives. Among its effective methods, TOPSIS (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution) stands out to rank the most suitable solutions based on diverse criteria. In this study, TOPSIS is utilized for tri-objective optimization, facilitating the ranking of Pareto solution alternatives from various options according to various criteria. The process involves normalization and weighted summation of the objectives, determining an ideal solution, Euclidean distance calculations, calculating closeness, ranking based on their closeness to the ideal solution, and selecting the best alternative solution. The final decision is based on the preference for maximization or minimization of the criteria that select the best compromise solutions, as indicated in Fig. 3 .   5 Results and discussion The developed approach is used for optimizing four optimization cases described above. First, the GRNN training results are described followed by multi-objective optimization results. 5.1 Results of GRNN-based model training GRNN-based models have gained widespread popularity in diverse fields due to their ability to mimic the human brain's learning process. The model training process involves generating 100 data points using Aspen Plus simulation, which comprises decision variables and objective functions. Subsequently, this dataset is divided into two subsets: 70% for training, and 30% for testing. The GRNN model is trained using 5-fold cross-validation, assessing its ability to perform well on the given data. The comparative analysis of actual and predicted results can be found in  Fig. 4 (a-f). It can be observed that the GRNN model has been successfully trained to predict the actual values of objective functions. Moreover, the GRNN model has demonstrated favorable performance regarding R2  and MSE for all objectives, suggesting high accuracy and plausibility. The R2  values ranged from 98.451% to 99.95%, indicating a reliable performance of the model. The MSE values varied from 8.35 Ã 10  â 4     to 0.075278, indicating low error rates. The low MSE indicated that the model's predictions are close to the actual values, signifying the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on unseen data. Moreover, the high R2  score confirmed that the model captured a significant portion of the variance in the dependent variable, demonstrating its effectiveness in explaining the underlying relationships between the input and output data. Fig. 4 (a-f) visualizes actual and predicted values, demonstrating model performance, while  Table 1  supports reliability with MSE and R2  metrics. The training results for different case studies, such as Case 1 involving R and TEC (a and b), Case 2 involving EPEI and TEC (c and d), and Case 3 involving R and EPEI (e and f), are illustrated for both actual and predicted model outcomes. Further, model training is performed for each case study as these involve different objectives. These results demonstrate a strong correlation between the actual and predicted values for the specified objectives in each case study, with most data points aligning along a linear trend. The correlation is reinforced by higher R2  and lower MSE values, highlighting the GRNN model's excellence in accurately capturing the specified objectives in each case study. It is worth noting that the model's performance on testing data is paramount, as the primary aim is to make precise predictions on unseen data. These performance metrics are also presented in Table 1 . In summary, the successful training of the GRNN model is crucial for MOO using the MATLAB NSGA-II algorithm, as it provides accurate predictions for outcomes and is a reliable surrogate during computationally expensive optimizations. NSGA-II requires multiple iterations to find optimal solutions, making it computationally demanding. However, integrating an efficient surrogate model like GRNN significantly reduces the computational burden and accelerates optimization.  5.2 Results of GRNN-assisted multi-objective optimization In this section, the outcomes of the GRNN-based optimization for different cases studied are compared with results obtained from the simulated model-based (SMB) approach. The SMB approach performs multi-objective optimization directly on the Aspen Plus simulation model. This involves implementing thermodynamic models (i.e., Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong models) in each unit operation while obtaining the objective function results and therefore incurs higher computational efforts. However, GRNN-assisted MOO results are obtained by using the GRNN surrogate model trained on a dataset obtained from the Aspen Plus simulator. Such surrogate model-based MOO leads to savings in computing costs and time significantly which is extremely crucial in real operation. Consequently, a set of Pareto optimal solutions is obtained as visually depicted in  Fig. 5 (a-d). These results show the trade-off characteristics of the objectives and provide valuable insights for making the process more sustainable. The detailed analysis of the obtained results for different case studies is described next. Case 1 investigates maximizing R and minimizing TEC for sustainable methanol production. It employs a MOO approach to enhance resource utilization and reduce energy costs. The results of this investigation were displayed in Fig. 5 (a), presenting the Pareto optimal front that showcased the trade-off between R and TEC objective functions. Moreover, in Fig. 5 (a), a comparison is made between the computed results from the simulated model-based (SMB) approach using Aspen Plus software and those obtained through the Generalized Regression Neural network-assisted multi-objective optimization (GRNNAMOO) approach. The (R, TEC) values for SMB range from (72.86%, 3.911 $/GJ) to (85.22%, 4.915 $/GJ), while the GRNNAMOO approach yields results spanning from (70.12%, 3.658 $/GJ) to (85.41%, 4.99 $/GJ). Notably, the SMB and GRNNAMOO results exhibit a close alignment, which signifies the successful capture of pertinent data by the GRNN surrogate model during training and its practical application in MOO. Furthermore, the capacity utilization guide (Capacity Utilization: A Complete Guide, 2023 ) sets standards and guidelines for overall resource utilization (R) as a crucial metric within modern industrial frameworks. The guide reveals that most industries operate at R (%) of approximately 70â80%. However, an excellent value for R (%) is 85%. This research study demonstrates that the SMB and GRNNAMOO align faithfully with this guide, with R (%) values approaching 85.22% and 85.41%, respectively. These achieved results are due to recycling unreacted effluents back into the initial methanol feed reactor (Fig. 1 ). This is crucial in saving resource utilization through the recycling process and reduces the environmental impact that aligns with SDG12, emphasizing responsible consumption and production within a circular economy framework. Furthermore, these MOO results show a reduction in TEC compared to those obtained by Carolina and BarraÃ±on (Carolina and BarraÃ±on, 2006 ) who conducted biofuel cost analyses based on international standards. Their research indicated a TEC range of 4â12 $/GJ for methanol production under specific operating conditions, including temperatures between 200 and 350âÂ°C, pressure ranging from 50 to 100âbar, and energy input set at 400âMW for the TEC objective. This study adopted the same operating conditions for comparison purposes. However, our results demonstrate more favorable outcomes than the lower 4 $/GJ range value. Specifically, the SMB achieved a TEC value of 3.911 $/GJ, representing a reduction of 2.225%. Moreover, the GRNNAMOO attained a TEC value of 3.658 $/GJ, showcasing an even more significant reduction of 8.55%, surpassing the findings of (Carolina and BarraÃ±on, 2006 ) study. This notable improvement highlights the achievement of affordable energy usage in methanol production, aligning with SDG7. Further, the variations of decision variables of Pareto optimal solutions (shown in Fig. 5 (a)) with corresponding objective function values are shown in Fig. S1  of the supplementary material. As (R, TEC) values for GRNNAMOO vary from (70.12%, 3.658 $/GJ) to (85.41%, 4.99 $/GJ), the (RT, RP, RR1, PFC, FFI, RGR) values vary from (253.3 Â°C, 22.31âbar, 9.584 molar, 18.03âbar, 23790âkg/hr, 286.4âkg/hr) to (257.8Â°C, 29.06âbar, 9.996 molar, 19.7âbar, 23980âkg/hr, 287.2âkg/hr). These results show that RT, RP, and RR1 have a major influence on the variations of optimal values of R and TEC. This is quite natural as the decrease in RT, RP and RR1 decreases the heat duty and thus reduces the TEC whereas an increase in these improves material consumption and thus improves the R. Case 2 focuses on exploring the potential of achieving environmental sustainability and cost-efficiency in a methanol synthesis plant. This is pursued by minimizing EPEI and TEC. As depicted in Fig. 5 (b), the Pareto optimal front highlights the optimized trade-off between the EPEI and TEC to provide insights into the possibility of striking a balance between environmental impact and energy costs incurred. It is evident that as the TEC decreases, the EPEI increases, indicating the trade-off between emission increment and energy cost decrements that occur in the methanol production process. The SMB outcomes for the objective values (EPEI, TEC) ranged between (86.46 gCO2 eq/MJ, 10.91 $/GJ) and (89.42 gCO2 eq/MJ, 10.57 $/GJ). Similarly, the GRNNAMOO results vary from (86.03 gCO2 eq/MJ, 11.05 $/GJ) to (90.2 gCO2 eq/MJ, 10.55 $/GJ). The results of both the SMB and GRNNAMOO are in good agreement, suggesting that the GRNN surrogate model successfully captures the introduced data from the developed model. Furthermore, these results are compared with reported results in the literature (Hamelinck and Bunse, 2022; Methanol Institute, 2022 ). According to the Methanol Institute guide, modern methanol plants have an estimated carbon footprint of approximately 110 gCO2 eq/MJ. However, our study demonstrates better results with an SMB value of 89.42 gCO2 eq/MJ and GRNNAMOO results of 90.2 gCO2 eq/MJ. This indicates a significant reduction of 18% in CO2  emissions in this work, according to the GRNNAMOO result under 200â350âÂ°C temperature, 50â100âbar pressure, and the same operating conditions as those reported in the literature. Consequently, the focus on minimizing the EPEI objective leads to achieving SDG13, which aims to reduce emissions within the methanol model and meet climate action targets. Moreover, when comparing the TEC results with the study conducted by (Carolina and BarraÃ±on, 2006 ), TEC values of 11.05 $/GJ which fall within the range of 4â12 $/GJ at 400âMW energy input, which is crucial for ensuring the energy affordability according to the SDG7 in the methanol production plant as discussed in detail in Case 1. Further, the variations of decision variables of Pareto optimal solutions for Case 2 (shown in Fig. 5 (b)) with corresponding objective function values are shown in Fig. S2  of the supplementary material. As (EPEI, TEC) values for GRNNAMOO vary from (86.03 gCO2 eq/MJ, 11.05 $/GJ) to (90.2 gCO2 eq/MJ, 10.55 $/GJ), the (RT, RP, RR1, PFC, FFI, RGR) values vary from (263.2 Â°C, 29.69âbar, 9.996 molar, 10.1âbar, 20190âkg/hr, 178âkg/hr) to (255.7 Â°C, 22.42âbar, 7.617 molar, 10.0âbar, 19480âkg/hr, 135.2âkg/hr). These results show that RT, RP, RR1, and RGR have a major influence on the variations of optimal values of EPEI and TEC. This is quite natural as the decrease in RT, RP, and RR1 primarily decreases the TEC whereas the increase in RGR increases the carbon emissions and thus leads to higher values of EPEI. Case 3 study focuses on the minimization of EPEI and the maximization of R objectives which results in emission reduction, energy savings, and resource conservation. The Pareto front results of EPEI and R, as depicted in Fig. 5 (c), aimed to maximize the R (%) and minimize the EPEI (gCO2 eq/MJ) objectives, simultaneously. These objective values (R, EPEI) obtained from the SMB fell within the range of (79.63%, 57.74 gCO2 eq/MJ) to (87.15%, 63.41 gCO2eq/MJ). Similarly, the results from the GRNNAMOO spanned from (77.4%, 57.68 gCO2 eq/MJ) to (87.32%, 65.49 gCO2 eq/MJ). This indicates that the results of SMB and GRNNAMOO are closely matching. According to the Capacity Utilization guide (Capacity Utilization: A Complete Guide, 2023 ), an excellent benchmark for utilization rate is 85%. In this study, the R (%) has shown a notable improvement of 2.657% for the GRNNAMOO result. On the other hand, studies by (Hamelinck and Bunse, 2022; Methanol Institute, 2022 ) reported that the emission value in a modern methanol production plant is 110 gCO2 eq/MJ. In this work, the EPEI has been remarkably reduced by 40.464% compared to this value based on the results obtained from the GRNNAMOO approach. Consequently, the R (%) values show an enhanced utilization of resources, aligning with the principles of a circular economy. Furthermore, the EPEI (gCO2 eq/MJ) objective effectively reduces CO2  gas emissions, contributing to climate action as emphasized in SDG13. Ultimately, the concurrent pursuit of both objectives harmoniously contributes to the overarching goal of fostering sustainable development compared to the studies reported in the literature. Further, the variations of decision variables of Pareto optimal solutions (shown in Fig. 5 (c)) with corresponding objective function values are shown in Fig. S3  of the supplementary material. As (R, EPEI) values for GRNNAMOO vary from (77.4%, 57.68 gCO2 eq/MJ) to (87.27%, 65.37 gCO2 eq/MJ), the (RT, RP, RR1, PFC, FFI, RGR) values vary from (275.4 Â°C, 64.82âbar, 9.999 molar, 17.16âbar, 21460âkg/hr, 153.9âkg/hr) to (279.9 Â°C, 81.77âbar, 9.996 molar, 14.28âbar, 22010âkg/hr, 237.9âkg/hr). These results show that RT, RP, PFC, and RGR have a major influence on the variations of optimal values of R and EPEI. This is quite natural as the decrease in RT, RP, and RGR and increases in PFC reduce the separation efficiency and thus increase the waste production which reduces the R. However, the decrease in heat duty reduces carbon emissions and thus lowers the EPEI. Case 4 focuses on optimizing tri-objective formulation to reduce EPEI and TEC while maximizing R. It employs the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique, TOPSIS, to rank optimal solution results. The achieved Pareto front solutions enhance efficient resource utilization, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and enable cost-effective energy consumption. These results, displayed in Fig. 5 (d), highlight the results in light-blue color for the SMB ideal point result (R, TEC, EPEI) at (77.32, 10.79, 82.16) respectively, and in normal blue color for the GRNNAMOO result (R, TEC, EPEI) at (84.37, 10.45, 81.34) respectively. Thus, optimizing these three objectives simultaneously offers practical advantages in industrial applications since most industrial problems often have more than two objectives. Accordingly, both the SMB and GRNNAMOO methods demonstrate good agreement results. The optimal R value obtained using GRNNAMOO is slightly higher than that obtained using SMB. This could be attributed to the attainment of a better-optimized solution or could be due to approximate calculations enabled by the surrogate model compared to the actual Aspen Plus model. Additionally, the obtained outcomes from GRNNAMOO reveal interesting insights. The value of 84.37% for R suggests improvements in overall resource utilizations, the value of 10.45 $/GJ for TEC indicates energy affordability targets, and the value of 81.34 gCO2 eq/MJ for EPEI suggests reductions of CO2  emissions compared to the benchmark literature studies discussed in Cases 1, 2, and 3. The comparison of corner solutions of Pareto optimal fronts obtained in Cases 1 â 3, the best operating solution obtained using TOPSIS for Case 4, and the base solution is given in  Table 2 . The base solution corresponds to the benchmark data sourced from the literature. The comparison illustrates that the best value of TEC is obtained for Case 1 corner point A. However, it corresponds to a significantly lower value of R (= 70.12%). Similarly, the best value of R is obtained for Case 3 corner point F. Also, it corresponds to a significantly lower value of EPEI (= 65.49 gCO2eq/MJ). Further, the best value of EPEI is obtained for Case 3 corner point E but it corresponds to a significantly lower value of R (= 77.4%). Compared to these individual corner points, the obtained operating solution for Case 4 gives reasonably good values for all three objectives (TEC = 10.45 $/GJ, R = 84.37%, EPEI = 81.34 gCO2eq/MJ) and illustrates the importance of optimizing all objectives simultaneously. Further, these values are significantly better than the base values which signify the need for multi-objective optimization of industrial processes. Also, the values of decision variables obtained for solutions shown in Table 2  are under the ranges used in real industrial operations (Ateka et al., 2017; Kiss et al., 2016; Lefebvre et al., 2019; Marcos et al., 2022; Smitshuysen et al., 2020; Tidona et al., 2013 ). For some corner solutions, RR1 is approaching the upper limit. However, it is not advisable to operate the plant outside the range of 4 â¤ RR1 â¤ 10 as this range is selected based on the usual operating practices. Moreover, GRNNAMOO offers a substantial computational advantage. It results in a significant reduction in optimization time, with the process completed within a fraction of a minute for all case studies, i.e., Case 1 takes 12.684âseconds, Case 2 takes 10.875âseconds, Case 3 takes 9.5278âseconds, and Case 4 takes 16.8167âseconds on Intel Â®Coreâ¢ i7â10700âK CPUÂ® 3.80âGHz Windows PC with 32.0âGB RAM computer. In comparison with this, a similar study on the distillation process performed in our previous research (Wolday et al., 2023 ) using ANN coupled with NSGA-II resulted in computation times of â¼ 4000 and â¼ 5000âminutes for two- and three-objective optimizations, respectively. This illustrates the computational efficiency of the developed approach.   6 Conclusions In this study, the methanol synthesis plant is modeled using Aspen Plus 12.0. A GRNN model is trained and selected for surrogate modeling of the process. The GRNNAMOO achieves optimal results for TEC, R, and EPEI objective functions. These findings contribute significantly to sustainable development goals such as SDG7, SDG12, and SDG13 in methanol production. The key conclusions drawn from the obtained results are given below.â¢ The model dataset training achieved satisfactory results, measured by MSE and R2  evaluation metrics. The utilization of a GRNN surrogate model effectively assisted the optimization process. This approach significantly reduces computing time and facilitates optimal Pareto front solutions' attainment.  â¢ In all cases, there are trade-offs between the two objectives as shown in Fig. 5 . In the case 1 scenario, the Pareto optimal front shown in Fig. 5 (a) represents R's maximization and TEC's minimization. The GRNNAMOO results reveal that the optimal points for R and TEC are 85.41% and 4.99 $/GJ (Point B), respectively, contributing to the circular economy aspect of SDG12. Similarly, the Pareto optimal solutions shown in Fig. 5 (b) for Case 2 illustrate that the EPEI and TEC values obtained using GRNNAMOO are 90.2 gCO2 eq/MJ and 10.55 $/GJ (Point D), respectively, which is crucial for ensuring energy affordability in the methanol production plant, aligned with SDG7. Additionally, the Pareto optimal solutions shown in Fig. 5 (c) for Case 3 illustrate that R and EPEI values using GRNNAMOO are 87.32% and 65.49 gCO2 eq/MJ (Point F), respectively, contributing to climate action as emphasized in SDG13. The synergy between both objectives ultimately supports the overarching goal of sustainable development.  â¢ Additionally, in the Case 4 study, the TOPSIS method is employed to rank the optimal solution shown in Fig. 5 (d) for the three-objective optimization problem. The best operating solution (Point H shown by normal blue color) selected from the set of GRNNAMOO solutions using TOPSIS is (R = 84.37, TEC = 10.45, EPEI = 81.34). Simultaneously optimizing such multiple objectives offers practical advantages in industrial applications since most industrial problems involve more than two objectives.
