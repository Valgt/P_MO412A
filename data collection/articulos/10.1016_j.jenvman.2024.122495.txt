                  Sustainable development goals and rising sustainability concerns push stakeholders and society to demand organizations adopt innovative practices that can contribute to business sustainability. This study aims to provide a systematic review through comprehensive bibliometric analysis of almost 1st quarter of the 21st century. The main focus is on how green human resource management practices promote and have a relationship with environmental performance, which is a significant part of sustainability. The authors systematically reviewed 242 top-tier articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases by following the “preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses” methodology. A significant relationship began in 2015 and gained popularity after COVID-19. The studies suggest that management should embrace the most demanding green human resource management practices, such as green competence building, motivation enhancement, and employee involvement, for better environmental performance. So, organizations can help acquire and retain committed and eco-friendly employees whose ecological values and objectives are compatible with the organization. The study also provides insight into the role of green human resource management practices in fostering eco-friendly behaviour of employees that, in turn, influence environmental performance. Most authors used the theory of ability-motivation-opportunity, a supporting mechanism for how organizations protect the environment through adopting green human resource management practices. In the future, corporate environmental responsibility, environmental regulations intensity, pro-environmental behaviour, and green work-life balance are suggested mechanisms to enhance environmental performance through green human resource management practices.

Sustainable development goals and rising sustainability concerns push stakeholders and society to demand organizations adopt innovative practices that can contribute to business sustainability. This study aims to provide a systematic review through comprehensive bibliometric analysis of almost 1st quarter of the 21st century. The main focus is on how green human resource management practices promote and have a relationship with environmental performance, which is a significant part of sustainability. The authors systematically reviewed 242 top-tier articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases by following the “preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses” methodology. A significant relationship began in 2015 and gained popularity after COVID-19. The studies suggest that management should embrace the most demanding green human resource management practices, such as green competence building, motivation enhancement, and employee involvement, for better environmental performance. So, organizations can help acquire and retain committed and eco-friendly employees whose ecological values and objectives are compatible with the organization. The study also provides insight into the role of green human resource management practices in fostering eco-friendly behaviour of employees that, in turn, influence environmental performance. Most authors used the theory of ability-motivation-opportunity, a supporting mechanism for how organizations protect the environment through adopting green human resource management practices. In the future, corporate environmental responsibility, environmental regulations intensity, pro-environmental behaviour, and green work-life balance are suggested mechanisms to enhance environmental performance through green human resource management practices.

This report was discussed under the United Nations (UN) Conference on Environment and Development in 1989 and remained successful in spreading the idea of SD globally. Later, these efforts became part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, comprising 17 SDGs covering economic, social, and environmental aspects (Lyulyov et al., 2024 ). So, to attain the 2030 SDGs, countries integrate them into national policies, exerting pressure on organizations to embrace environmental, social, and ethical responsibilities. As a result, organizations have started to adopt innovative practices, promoting the link between business operations and environmental sustainability. However, climate change, economic fluctuations, conflicts, and events like COVID-19 have hindered progress toward achieving the SDGs (Nhamo and Chapungu, 2024 ). The world has spent half of its journey towards the SGDs 2030 deadline since its emergence; still, goals are not yet accomplished. Despite these obstacles, organizations can still work hard to achieve goals. Therefore, urgent actions are required to save the planet for us and future generations. Society wants businesses to be ethically, socially, and environmentally responsible (Dong et al., 2024 ). Due to rising sustainability concerns, stakeholders demand organizations adopt innovative and sustainable practices that can contribute to business sustainability (Sun et al., 2024 ). As all activities are under and after human consent in any organization, the role of the human resources department is vital. Furthermore, green human resource management (GHRM) practices are essential for environmental performance (EP) because they serve as a key mechanism and provide a pathway through which organizations can align their operations with the principles of sustainability, which could lead toward the global sustainability agenda (Saeed et al., 2022 ; Shakil et al., 2024 ). It cultivates pro-environmental behaviour, environmental commitment, green innovation, green creativity, and environmental performance (Peng et al., 2024 ). According to Raza and Khan (2022) , different departments of businesses are progressively implementing the philosophy of “go green”. So, by integrating green human resource management practices (GHRMP), organizations can foster a culture of environmental responsibility among employees as, GHRMP affects employees' attitudes, behaviour, commitment, and performance toward sustainability (Ansari et al., 2021 ). Kim (2022)  also argued that proper green policies and implementing and promoting eco-friendly behaviour among employees may increase organizations' commitment towards sustainability, eventually leading to less resource consumption, decreased carbon emissions, and an overall improvement in environmental performance and management. To be green is a new shift for organizations, primarily due to national policies that require a commitment from both management and employees (Wu et al., 2022 ). It occurs through GHRM-influenced activities and promotes green behaviour among employees (DuBois and Dubois, 2012 ). It is argued that employees who appreciate green practices and care about the environment try to enhance environmental performance (Umrani et al., 2020 ). An ecological commitment stems from an intrinsic desire to protect or improve the environment (Kim, 2022 ). In the same perspective, Afsar et al. (2020)  argued that higher emotional commitment is linked to better environmental performance at workplace, including recycling, energy efficiency, turning off extra lights, and general concern for the environment. In short, when workers are dedicated to the organization, they work hard to achieve their goals (Serenko, 2024 ). Though all sectors pollute the environment, however, the manufacturing sector is the major contributor (Qian et al., 2022 ; Raza and Khan, 2022 ). Different toxic waste and hazardous chemicals, which are by-products of manufacturing operations as well as other industrial activities, have severely damaged ecosystems and human health (Pham et al., 2020 ; Wang, 2020 ). Many manufacturing industries rely on different natural resources, and their daily activities severely damage the environment's fragile equilibrium (Chaudhary, 2020 ). So, industries are actively looking for alternate methods or such methods that can result in less damage to the ecosystem by incorporating environmental and social considerations into the fundamental fabric of their business models and operations (Cabral and Jabbour, 2020 ). GHRM emerges as a strategic solution that empowers industries to achieve their sustainability goals (Wang et al., 2023 ). In short, to build an ecologically conscious and engaged workforce, GHRM strategies can be implemented across the employee lifecycle, such as during hiring, training and development, performance appraisal, and incentive policies. Eventually, this promotes a responsibility culture regarding environmental concerns throughout the company, resulting in lower resource consumption, less waste generation, and increased ecological performance of workers and organizations. This Bibliometric review comprehends Green HRM practices and their relationship to environmental performance which will provide detailed insights regarding publications, past/future trends, and prominent authors, that ultimately will help new prospective authors of those fields so that if anyone has intentions, then they can take benefit from the history and even can request to do a work through collaboration with senior authors of that fields. It also provide insights into the limitations of previous authors and future work recommendations by providing a more comprehensive, rigorous, and updated literature synthesis on a particular relationship between GHRMP and EP, especially with a specific focus on relevant business, management, social science, and business psychology contexts. Keen scholars can gain dynamic perspectives on these popular themes and issues. These insights will allow forthcoming researchers to more appropriately update their current knowledge and methodology (Beloskar et al., 2024 ), which are the critical criteria for publishing the study in a reputable journal (Teixeira and Carvalho, 2024 ). This study makes several significant contributions to the existing literature on Green Human Resource Management (GHRM) and Environmental Performance (EP). Firstly, conducting a comprehensive bibliometric analysis offers a thorough and up-to-date overview of the research landscape, highlighting the most influential studies, authors, and regions involved in this field. Secondly, the study uncovers intellectual structures and collaboration networks that have shaped the development of GHRM and EP research, providing valuable insights for future research directions. Thirdly, by synthesizing previous findings and identifying gaps in the literature, this study not only reinforces the importance of GHRM practices in driving environmental sustainability but also proposes areas where further exploration is needed. Finally, the findings serve as a guide for both scholars and practitioners, enabling them to build upon established knowledge while exploring new avenues for enhancing environmental performance through strategic human resource practices. This study's contributions are crucial for advancing our understanding of how GHRM can be leveraged to meet global sustainability goals and for guiding future research efforts in this vital area.  2 Theoretical underpinning and literature review The recent development has provided evidence and support to the idea that specific GHRM practices are significantly correlated with the environmental performance of organizations. Environmental performance is the commitment expected by organizations to guard the environment (Paillé et al., 2014 ). A lot of literature is present which shows the relationship of GHRMP with different fields such as green supply chain management (Maskuroh et al., 2023 ), finance (O'Donohue and Torugsa, 2016 ), Marketing (Aftab and Veneziani, 2024 ), innovation (Shah and Soomro, 2023 ), sustainability (Ziyadeh et al., 2024 ), environmental management (Rana and Arya, 2024 ), and environmental performance (Jnaneswar, 2024 ). Accordingly, GHRM has different dimensions for improving environmental performance (Aftab et al., 2023 ; Anwar et al., 2020 ). Based on the well-established Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) theory, which was proposed by Appelbaum (2000) , it is argued that GHRM practices contribute to an organization's environmental performance by increasing the extent to which employees can do according to their competencies, wants to do according to their motivation, and can do according to opportunities they got (Vázquez-Brust et al., 2023 ); details are shown in Fig. 1  . According to Renwick et al. (2013)  and Aftab et al. (2023) , the first dimension of GHRMP is “green competence building practices” (GCBP), which fulfils the first criterion of AMO theory, called ability. Based on their abilities, employees get recruited and selected by the organization, and green training and green development programs help to raise employees' ability regarding environmental knowledge and competencies (Teixeira et al., 2012 ). The second dimension is “green motivation enhancing practices” (GMEP), which fulfils the second criterion of AMO theory, called “Motivation”. GMEP includes performance evaluations and rewards that encourage workers to align their activities with the environmental objectives of the firm (Harvey et al., 2013 ). So, motivations from positive vibes like rewards and motivations from negative vibes like performance evaluations play vital roles in enhancing employee performance. The third dimension is “green employee involvement practices” (GEIP), which fulfils the third criterion of AMO theory: opportunity. GEIP includes empowering staff members to participate in environmental management decisions and offering solutions for environmental problems (DuBois and Dubois, 2012 ). Although AMO theory has been mainly adopted at the individual level, Jiang et al. (2013)  have recently argued that it also holds both conceptually and empirically at the organizational level (Jiang et al., 2013 ; Pinzone et al., 2016 ). GHRM practices, when well implemented, can improve environmental performance (Masud et al., 2023 ; Pham et al., 2019 ; Singh et al., 2020 ). Implementing GHRM practices is also essential because organizations face increased pressure from key stakeholders, such as customers and investors, to engage in eco-friendly management practices and produce environment-friendly products and services (Sun et al., 2024 ). The literature suggests that organizations should hire employees based on their environmental values, beliefs, and knowledge (Renwick et al., 2013 ). This way will enable the human resource management department to actively engage in green HR practices from the moment employees join the organization. Eventually, green practices will enhance efficiency, value creation, and cost control (Kim et al., 2019 ). Extensive academic research about the correlation between an organisation's green HRM strategies and overall success is evident. For example, Gilal et al. (2019)  found that green HRM practices in higher education institutes help to improve environmental performance. Similarly, (Pham et al. (2019)  proposed that GHRM practices such as green training, green performance management, and green employee participation increase employees' desire to participate in the organization's green initiatives. According to previous research, organizational citizenship behavior also positively impacts environmental performance. Workers' pro-environmental behaviours, such as waste reduction, assist an organization in accomplishing its environmental goals and increasing ecological sustainability (Gilal et al., 2019 ). These studies underlined the need for future studies with a better research design (Khan and Muktar, 2024 ; Nisar et al., 2024 ). The literature on GHRM practices and environmental performance has diverse dynamics and relationships with other essential elements and areas of business management and the industry. Extensive literature review with future research directions in a table format has been given in the appendix. However, it is worth noting that a considerable and growing body of scholarly work has focused on appreciating the characteristics of GHRM practices and their effects on environmental performance outcomes (Khan and Muktar, 2024 ; Pham et al., 2019 ; Singh et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it is worth investigating the evolution of HRM departments toward green HRM practices and their relationship with environmental performance, particularly in the literature from the twenty-first century to the present. This investigation will deepen our understanding of these pertinent emerging concepts in business, management, and accounting.  3 Methodology 3.1 Article selection process and PRISMA Flow Chart For this bibliometric analysis, the authors conducted a comprehensive search using the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus database, which involved different stages. The bibliometric analysis comprised 242 high-quality published articles in the WOS and Scopus databases between 2000 and Feb 2024. Authors use advanced search queries to find articles related to GHRM Practices and Environmental Performance (research queries are shown in the appendix). The search query utilized different keywords (such as “GHRM Practices”, “Green Human Resource Practices”, “Environmental Performance”, etc.). The initial search returned 1257 records from both databases, which were then filtered and narrowed down by following the methodology of “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)” proposed by Page et al. (2021) . So, put different substitute keywords regarding “green human resource management practices” and “environmental performance” in various combinations using different Boolean Operators (AND, OR, NOT). When searched the abstract, 105 and 1152 documents were retrieved from Scopus and WOS databases, respectively. These results were more general. To develop a specific solution, we narrowed it down by applying the time frame of 2000 to 24-Feb-2024, and then the results were Scopus  = 105/WOS  = 903  articles. Early access articles are preferred for literature reviews because they offer original and authentic peer-reviewed results. So, after filtering it according to document type, the authors found Scopus  = 94/WOS  = 854  articles. As the authors' primary concern was to target the Business, Management, Social Science, and Psychology fields due to topic need and selected keywords relationship as well as relevance, the authors applied the filter of the subject area and found Scopus  = 91/WOS  = 232  articles. Lastly, most research is published in English because English-speaking readers represent a larger population than others. As the authors have planned to write this manuscripts in English to reach a wider audience and enhance the visibility of their work, they applied English as a filter and found Scopus  = 91/WOS  = 230  articles. In short, selecting the published peer-reviewed articles was carefully done by seeing the need and relevance to the research topic. Finally, 242 documents were selected for the bibliometric analysis. Fig. 2   (PRISMA Flow Chart) provides the whole procedure step by step. A PRISMA chart was developed with the help of ShinyApp, an online utility provided by Haddaway et al. (2022), and then edited to give more details.  3.2 Bibliometric analysis Bibliometric analysis is a well-established, developing, and successful approach for managing and interpreting massive quantities of data in business research (Otitolaiye and Abd Aziz, 2024 ; Saeed et al., 2023 ). As targeted, both databases have different interfaces and properties, so we downloaded the two separate files with complete records and combined them using R Package's command named “mergeDbSources” and analysed that data file through software named VOSviewer for bibliometric analysis according to the guidelines (Orduña-Malea and Costas, 2021 ). This bibliometric analysis included identifying top-cited articles, top authors, top countries producing the most documents and citations, and top journals to reveal the vital occurrence of keywords and collaboration among authors and countries through co-authorship and co-occurrence analysis. In the end, the authors use the method of “Rake” used for “keywords extraction” through Python by following the instructions of Rose et al. (2010)  to get the most prominent and most recommended future directions so that this study not only provides bibliometric profile but provide directions for prospect researchers as well.   4 Results and discussion 4.1 GHRM practices and environmental performance bibliometric profile 4.1.1 Publication activity Fig. 3   represents a bar chart for the number of published documents per year from 2000 to February 2024 concerning the GHRM practices and EP. According to our targeted filters from 2000 to 2015, different publications were retrieved, but after applying different filter criteria such as “document type, subject area, and language”, the publications till 2015 were filtered out. Still, it does not mean that no publication was done on the studied relationship during this year. So, authors keep it the same as the truth and show the publication's actual record. It is evident that since 2016, scholars have given more attention, and the number of publications was enhanced, such as four publications in 2016, three in 2017, and so on during the following years. In 2023, a peak number of publications was recorded, with 81 published documents. The publication trend indicates a significant surge in published documents, with 241 publications. This rising trend proposes a growing interest in the field represented by GHRM practices and their relationship with EP-related publications.  4.1.2 Top articles Table 1   illustrates the top 10 highly cited research articles about GHRM Practices and EP. According to the bibliometric analysis, the period from 2000 to Feb-2024 was the most prominent for GHRM practices and EP research, with a highly cited article titled " Green Innovation and Environmental Performance: The Role of Green Transformational Leadership and Green Human Resource Management” by Singh et al. (2020) , with total 779 citations. This article was published in the journal “Technological Forecasting and Social Change” and continues to be widely popular among research scholars to get guidance—Table 1  also shares information for second, third, and so on in sequence by citations.  4.1.3 Top journals Table 2   and Fig. 4  a share the top 15 journals with the highest publications, discussing GHRM practices, their relationship with EP, and their citations and publishers. According to the table, "Sustainability", “Journal of Cleaner Production”, and “Environmental Science and Pollution Research” rank as the most productive journals in this domain, while the Journal of Cleaner Production” emerges as the most influential in terms of citations, as can be seen in Fig. 4  b.  4.1.4 Top authors Table 3   and Fig. 5   show the authors' article contributions to the GHRM Practices and EP relationship based on the number of published documents. Nisar, Qasim Ali has the highest number of publications on GHRM Practices and EP relationship (n = 9), affiliated with “The Superior College Lahore, Pakistan”. Additionally, Chaudhary and Richa have (n = 4) documents and the remaining authors in Fig. 5  have fewer than four documents.  4.1.5 Top countries Fig. 6   showcases the country's most prolific in researching GHRM Practices and EP. Some countries are deemed to be more “active” than others in this area, and as a result, they have contributed significantly to advancing research in the field. When it comes to producing research papers, China (n = 59) is the most prominent country, followed by Pakistan (n = 56), Malaysia (n = 52), and so on.   4.2 GHRM practices and EP's intellectual structure 4.2.1 Co-Authorships Authors’ Map According to Ponomariov and Boardman (2016) , co-authorships reveal the collaborative relationships and social interactions that form the intellectual framework of a field. A co-authorship analysis was performed by examining the articles of authors who have written most of the documents on the relationship between GHRM practices and EP. To create a “Co-Authorships Authors’ Map”, we keep a minimum threshold level of one document in the scholar profile as eligibility, meaning the network of authors who have published a minimum of one co-author or have similar articles were selected in this map. A total of 738 scholars were eligible for this profile, but the most connectivity was found in 59 scholars, as shown in Fig. 7  .  4.2.2 Co-occurrence of keywords According to Yuan et al. (2022) , the co-occurrence of words within a particular field indicates the interconnection of keywords and their role in shaping the intellectual framework of that field. In this study, 92 keywords with the most significant link strength met the minimum threshold of 5 occurrences from the 971 keywords for co-occurrence mapping in VOSviewer. Those 92 co-occurred keywords fell into seven clusters with 55 items, making a total of 783 links, and their overall strength was 3667. The finding of the analysis “co-occurrence of keywords” is presented in Table 4  , which shows that “Green HRM Practices” was the most frequently occurring keyword with 217 occurrences and a total link strength of 1027 links. Meanwhile, HRM was second in the list of most occurring keywords, with 126 occurrences and a total link strength of 709 links. The third most occurring keyword was “Environmental Performance,” with 113 occurrences and a total link strength of 561 links. Visual presentation can be seen in Fig. 8  , where according to the occurrence of keywords with their link presented, the most occurring keywords have more visibility and links.  4.2.3 Leading countries and international collaboration The co-authorship map of countries highlights the prominent contributors in a particular field on a global scale. In this study, 59 countries with the most significant link strength met the minimum threshold of one document published with co-authorship status, mapped in VOSviewer, and presented in Fig. 9  . Of those 59, only 48 were strongly connected, which falls in eleven clusters with 144 links, and their overall strength was 257. The finding analysis reveals that China stands out at the top significantly with 59 documents (with total link strength, n = 186), Pakistan at second number with 56 papers (having total link strength, n = 166), and Malaysia remains at the top third with 52 documents (having total link strength, n = 178). Other countries have also made significant contributions in producing papers, more citations, and greater link strength in the GHRM practices and EP research (see Fig. 9  and Table 5  ).   4.3 Analysis summary and research trends The study strongly emphasizes Green HRM Practices, especially their relationship with Environmental Performance. Based on a thorough bibliometric examination, the authors noticed that GHRM practices are among the most significant sources of enhancing an organization's EP. Studies in different fields such as green supply chain management (Maskuroh et al., 2023 ), finance (O'Donohue and Torugsa, 2016 ), marketing (Aftab and Veneziani, 2024 ), innovation (Shah and Soomro, 2023 ), sustainability (Ziyadeh et al., 2024 ), environmental management (Rana and Arya, 2024 ), and environmental performance (Jnaneswar, 2024 ) are supporting the argument that GHRM practices have a strong influence on EP in different types of organizations. Organizations such as healthcare (Khan and Muktar, 2024 ), tourism (Rehan et al., 2024 ), education (Anwar et al., 2020 ), and manufacturing (Jnaneswar, 2024 ) are just some examples. Furthermore, multiple scholarly studies such as Khan and Muktar (2024) , Aftab et al. (2023) , and Farooq et al. (2022)  have found a significant link between distinct types of GHRM practices and EP such as “Green Competence Building Practices(GCBP)", “Green Motivation Enhancing practices (GMEP)", and “Green Employee Involvement practices (GEIP)". Nisar, Qasim Ali is the most productive author (see Table 3 ) who published nine articles in high-quality journals. His research also concluded that GHRM practices are a significant factor in enhancing environmental performance in organizations. Singh et al. (2020)  published an article that remains the most influential because it gained the highest citations (n = 779). It also concluded that employees who get support through green activities in the human resource department always have positive pro-environmental behavior, ultimately enhancing the organizational environmental performance. In terms of publications three most prominent journals were “Sustainability” (n = 27), “Journal of Cleaner Production” (n = 20), and “Environmental Science and Pollution Research” (n = 13) but in terms of total citations “Journal of Cleaner Production” (n = 2283), “Technological Forecasting and Social Change (n = 779)”, and “Business Strategy and The Environment” (n = 608), were remain prominent which published articles on the relationship of GHRM Practices and EP. According to Fig. 8 , the results share that seven different clusters provide ongoing research trends. Cluster 1 is about “climate, GHRMP, and SD”. This cluster's research themes are focused on how GHRMP helps to SD and green competitive advantage, notably in the manufacturing sector and green supply chain management. HRM practices are increasingly being aligned with climate-related goals and resource management in order to enhance environmental sustainability. Cluster 2 is about green innovation, leadership, and SMEs. This cluster highlights research trends regarding the role of leadership, particularly transformational and green leadership, in driving green innovation and environmental management within SMEs. The development of green skills that optimize resource allocation is gaining attention, particularly natural resource management being a particular focus. Cluster 3 is majorly focused on AMO theory, green creativity, and the hospitality industry. This cluster's research is increasingly focused on the application of the AMO (ability-motivation-opportunity) paradigm to improve green innovation and EP, particularly in the hotel industry. There is also a rising interest in how culture and servant leadership may inspire happiness and creativity in environmentally conscious activities. Cluster 4 is all about corporate social responsibility, firm performance, and supply chain management. Research trends in this cluster trends involve the integration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) with green intellectual capital and HRM practices to improve firm performance, particularly in the hotel industry. The interplay between competitive advantage, employee environmental engagement, and supply chain management is also a key focus. Cluster 5 trends are pro-environmental behavior, motivation, and job satisfaction. Studies in this cluster recommended keeping the emphasis on motivation by examining the relationship of pro-environmental behavior with job satisfaction and their impact on sustainability in the workplace. Employee citizenship behavior is acknowledged as an important feature in enhancing environmental responsibility within organizations, especially in the hospitality sector. Cluster 6 highlights the importance of green commitment, training, and development, particularly in the healthcare industry, where these practices are leading sustainability efforts. To enhance environmental performance (EP) in healthcare, future research should focus on cultivating a committed workforce through effective training and development initiatives. Cluster 7 highlights the connection between green human resource management (HRM) practices and both financial and organizational success. Recent studies indicate that environmental initiatives can directly contribute to improved financial performance, organizational success and overall organizational sustainability.   5 Conclusion and implications The current study provides a comprehensive overview of GHRM practices and EP from 2001 to Feb-2024. It highlights the significance of GHRM practices for enhancing environmental performance in business, management, social science, and organizational psychology. Researchers continue to explore the complex relationship between GHRM practices and EP. Recognizing and encouraging GHRM practices in organizations is increasing day by day. The findings of this bibliometric analysis relationship come up with two significant findings: one is about GHRM practices, and the second is about a prominent Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) framework on which basis this GHRM practices and EP model works. According to Khan and Muktar (2024)  and Aftab et al. (2023) , GHRM practices like “Green Competence Building Practices (GCBP)" provide employees with the necessary information and expertise to actively participate in environmental as well as sustainable activities, thereby minimizing resource usage & waste. Aftab et al. (2023)  and Ansari et al. (2021)  argued that “Green Motivation Enhancing Practices (GMEP)" encourage a sense of ecological accountability among staff, nurturing a culture of sustainability at the workplace. Moreover, Farooq et al. (2022)  and Jerónimo et al. (2020)  also argued that “Green Employee Involvement Practices (GEIP)" guarantee that staff actively engage in environmentally friendly projects, encouraging collaborative endeavours toward environmental objectives. The second significant finding during the analysis of GHRM practices and EP relationship is about the use of the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) framework on which foundations this relationship works effectively and efficiently (Aftab et al., 2023 ; Gupta and Jangra, 2024 ; Iftikar et al., 2022 ). Integrating GHRM practices into different organizational activities enhances energy efficiency, minimizes waste, and encourages the implementation of environmentally friendly methodologies. When GHRM practices harmonise with environmental ideals, they establish a mutually beneficial connection that improves the total EP, guaranteeing long-term sustainability. First and foremost, implementation is integration of GHRM Practices that organizations should incorporate GHRM practices, such as GCBP, GMEP, and GEIP, to significantly improve the EP. Then the adoption across different sectors is also among main implementations because various industries, including healthcare, tourism, education, and manufacturing, can benefit from implementing GHRM practices to align with sustainability goals and improve their impact on environment. Utilization of the AMO Framework is also a big point to effectively integrate GHRM practices, which helps in building employee competence, enhancing motivation, and providing opportunities for involvement in environmental initiatives. Focus on employee engagement through fostering a culture of sustainability through GHRM practices, organizations can encourage employees to adopt pro-environmental behaviors, leading to improved resource efficiency and reduced waste. 5.1 Limitations While this paper provides a comprehensive and updated overview of the research on GHRM practices and EP, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations. First, in this study, we adopted a bibliometric and systematic approach, giving us comprehensive information but somehow limited to the objective overview. Second, this paper is limited to the data retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases, and only bibliometric analysis has been performed. However, more research is needed to generalize findings, especially when uncovering contextual elements that may explain potential variances. Limitations always come up with suggestions, so this study provides future directions. In the future, researchers can perform bibliometric analysis by taking the keywords strategic HRM and pro-environmental behaviour of employees. The study context was not specific, so future research can be focused on different regions line, Gulf countries, “Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)” countries, countries that are part of the China-Pakistan-Economic Corridor (CPEC)” European countries, United States of America, War zone countries, and Next eleven (N11) countries. Multi-level and mixed studies can also be conducted by taking pre- and post-data related to COVID-19 and reflecting adverse effects on the relationship between GHRM practices and EP in case of any crisis. Region comparisons can also be conducted better to understand the insights of GHRM practices and EP. .  5.2 Future research directions Abo-Murad and Abdullah (2019)  provide the future direction regarding exploring retention strategies such as rewards and appraisals concerning the relationship between GHRM practices and EP. Tulsi and JI, 2020  proposed that corporate environmental responsibility (CER) is becoming more of a concern nowadays because GHRM practice can only be part of a department, and it will enhance EP if the whole organization adopts CER as a policy. Anwar et al. (2020)  suggest some moderators, such as organizational citizenship behaviour towards the environment, to test the relationships between GHRM practices and EP. Amrutha and Geetha (2020)  argue that employees are the main stakeholders of any organization, so within the relationship between GHRM practices and EP, the moderating effect of employee green behaviour should be checked. Ruiz et al. (2024)  proposed that cooperative and entrepreneurial archetypes necessitate the best and most well-defined GHRM practices oriented toward strategic environmental goals. Nisar et al. (2021)  suggest to check the impact of green self-efficacy as a moderating variable. Bazrkar and Moshiripour (2021)  suggested exploring green commitment and lifestyle as mediating variables in future studies. Shakil et al. (2024)  suggested exploring some moderators like green performance evaluation or green recruiting and selection, green work-life balance, management support, and resource perspective. Raza and Khan (2022)  did their study on the same discussed relationship in the hospitality industry. They provided many significant future directions, such as arguing that two other types of employee commitment force an employee to act like a green employee: normative and continuous commitment. They suggest checking both effects collectively and comparing them between GHRM and EP variables. They suggest influencing variable s to check this relationship, such as religious values, employees' personality traits, and government support. They also provide valuable future recommendations about comparisons between two or more developed and developing countries. Liu et al. (2022)  suggest exploring the individual GHRM practice's roles in developing greener employee attitudes to elevate sustainable consumption behaviour in regular and professional life. Aftab et al. (2023)  and Deshpande and Srivastava (2023)  provide future direction to check the intervening effect of green work-life balance, green training, and green emotional intelligence in the context of GHRM practices and EP. Aftab et al. (2023)  suggest additional influencing elements, such as corporate culture, managerial support, and employee attitude, between the complex nexus of GHRM practices and EP. Shaukat et al. (2023)  also provided their insights in favour of employees by arguing that green employee empowerment is an essential factor to know as an intervening variable between the relationship of GHRM practices and EP. Ogiemwonyi et al. (2023)  suggest exploring the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation with any leadership influence such as green transformational leadership. Rana and Arya (2024)  also suggest that future research should explore task-related behavior, green commitment, and organizational identification as intervening variables. Moreover, the extensive literature review with future research directions in a table format has been given in the appendix.

Xie, J et al., 2023 Green HRM practices for encouraging pro-environmental behavior among employees This study explores the impact of Green HRM practices on pro-environmental behavior with job satisfaction as a mediator. Findings suggest that Green HRM enhances pro-environmental behavior, with job satisfaction partially mediating this relationship, except for green recruitment and selection. Future research could explore the moderating effects of organizational culture, leadership, and employee demographics on the relationship between GHRM and pro-environmental behavior, as well as examine the long-term consequences of these practices for organizational sustainability.  Gyensare, MA et al., 2023 Green HRM practices, employee well-being, and sustainable work behavior The study examines how Green HRM practices affect employee well-being via green behavior, with resource commitment as a moderator. Findings highlight that Green HRM positively impacts well-being through green behavior, strengthened by resource commitment. Future research could explore the cross-cultural applicability of the findings, as well as the potential for developing a comprehensive framework for integrating GHRM, employee well-being, and sustainable work behavior within organizational strategies.  Niazi, UI et al., 2023 Green HRM, green innovation and environmental performance The study investigates the roles of Green HRM, green innovation, and transformational leadership in environmental performance, mediated by green CSR. Results show a significant impact of green innovation on performance, with green CSR as a mediator. Future research could explore the long-term impacts of GHRM on organizational performance and employee well-being, as well as the potential for developing a comprehensive framework for integrating GHRM, green innovation, leadership styles, and environmental performance into organizational strategy.  Khan, RU et al., 2023 Green HRM, organizational identification and sustainable development This study explores Green HRM's impact on sustainable performance via organizational identification, based on social identity theory. Findings indicate that organizational identification mediates the Green HRM-sustainable performance relationship. Future research could explore the cross-cultural applicability of the findings, as well as the potential for developing a comprehensive framework for integrating GHRM, organizational identification, and sustainable development into organizational strategy. Additionally, longitudinal studies could examine the long-term consequences of these practices for employee well-being and organizational performance.  Naz, S et al., 2023 Green HRM, psychological green climate, and pro-environmental behaviors The study examines the impact of Green HRM and corporate environmental strategy on environmental performance through psychological green climate and pro-environmental behaviors, with environmental knowledge as a moderator. Findings highlight the need for integrating corporate strategy with Green HRM. Future studies could explore the moderating effects of organizational culture, leadership, and employee demographics on the relationship between GHRM, psychological green climate, and pro-environmental behaviors. Additionally, longitudinal studies could examine the long-term consequences of these practices for organizational performance and societal impact. Furthermore, research could delve deeper into the specific GHRM practices that most effectively contribute to a positive psychological green climate and the subsequent impact on different types of pro-environmental behaviors.  Hadi H.K. et al., 2023 Green HRM: The Link Between Environmental and Employee Performance This study explores the relationship between Green HRM practices and environmental performance, moderated by green work climate perceptions. Results show positive effects of Green HRM on both environmental and employee performance, with climate perceptions as a moderator. Future research might explore the long-term impacts of GHRM on organizational reputation and financial performance, as well as the potential for developing a comprehensive framework for integrating GHRM into overall business strategy. Additionally, cross-cultural studies could be conducted to examine the generalizability of the findings in different contexts.  Islam, MA et al., 2023 Green HRM Practices and Millennial Employees' Turnover Intentions in Tourism Industry The study investigates Green HRM's influence on millennial turnover intentions in Malaysia's tourism sector, with work environment as a moderator. Only green involvement and rewards reduce turnover intentions, with no significant moderating effect of work environment. Future studies could explore the mediating roles of perceived organizational support, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment in the relationship between GHRM practices and millennial employees' turnover intentions. Additionally, cross-cultural comparisons could be conducted to examine the generalizability of the findings to different tourism contexts.  Elshaer, IA et al., 2023 Green HRM and Brand Citizenship Behavior in the Hotel Industry The research explores how Green HRM practices influence brand citizenship behavior (BCB) through organizational pride and moderated by individual green values in the hotel industry. Results indicate positive effects of Green HRM on BCB, mediated by organizational pride. Future research could examine the potential for developing a comprehensive framework for integrating GHRM, brand citizenship, and customer satisfaction into hotel management strategies. Additionally, longitudinal studies could examine the long-term consequences of these practices for organizational reputation and financial performance.  Lou X.; Zhang F., 2023 Green HRM and Corporate Environmental Performance: A Moderated Mediation Model The study investigates the impact of Green HRM on corporate environmental performance, mediated by environmental passion and responsibility, and moderated by supervisor support. Findings suggest significant positive impacts. Future research could extend this model by examining the dynamic interplay between GHRM, CEP, and other relevant variables over time. Additionally, cross-cultural studies could be conducted to assess the generalizability of the findings in different organizational contexts. Furthermore, exploring the long-term consequences of GHRM on organizational performance and societal impact would provide valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers.  Veerasamy, U et al., 2023 Green HRM and Employee Green Behavior: Participation and Involvement, and Training and Development The study examines the effect of Green HRM on employee green behavior, moderated by green training and participation. Results show positive impacts of recruitment, institutional initiatives, and performance management on green behavior. Future research could explore the moderating effects of organizational culture, leadership, and job characteristics on the relationship between GHRM practices and employee green behavior. Additionally, longitudinal studies could examine the long-term consequences of these practices for organizational sustainability and employee well-being.  Hameed, R.; Rehman, N.; Tufail, S.; Kiziloglu, M. (2023) Green human resource management and environmental knowledge: A moderated mediation model to endorse green CSR This study finds that Green Human Resource Management (GHRM) positively impacts green Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through pro-environmental behavior and climate, although resistance to change can hinder these efforts. Future research should explore overcoming barriers to GHRM adoption and further examine the role of environmental knowledge.  Wang et al. (2023)  Green human resource management and job pursuit intention: mediating role of corporate social responsibility and organizational reputation The research shows that GHRM practices increase job pursuit intentions through organizational reputation and CSR among students in Bangladesh. Future studies should investigate GHRM's role in attracting talent in other emerging economies and its long-term impact on organizational performance.  Hadi, S.; Mutiani; Abbas, E.W.; Jumriani; Ilhami, M.R. (2023) Green Human Resource Management for Tourism Sustainability This study emphasizes the importance of GHRM in Indonesia's tourism sector, particularly the need for tailored practices that prioritize opportunity over ability. Future research should focus on developing context-specific GHRM strategies for sustainable tourism in developing countries.  Rehan, M.; Abbass, K.; Hussain, Y.; Usman, M.; Makhdum, MSA. (2023) Green human resource management in Pakistan tourism industry: Moderating role of environmental knowledge and individual green values The study finds that GHRM significantly improves environmental performance through employee empowerment and green behavior, with environmental knowledge enhancing these effects. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of GHRM on organizational performance and tourist satisfaction, as well as the potential for developing tailored GHRM interventions for different segments of the Pakistani tourism industry. Additionally, comparative studies with other developing countries could be conducted to identify best practices and challenges in implementing GHRM initiatives.  Iqbal, R.; Shahzad, K.; Chaudhary, R. (2023) Green human resource management practices as a strategic choice for enhancing employees' environmental outcomes GHRM practices enhance employees' environmental commitment and organizational citizenship behavior through harmonious environmental passion. Future studies should further investigate the affective mechanisms underlying GHRM's impact on green employee behaviors.  Ahmad, J.; Al Mamun, A.; Reza, MNH.; Makhbul, ZKM.; Ali, KAM. (2023) Green human resource management, competitive advantages, and green ambidexterity GHRM practices lead to green competitive advantage and ambidexterity, with firm size moderating these effects. Future research could explore the role of digital technologies and innovation in mediating the relationship between GHRM and green ambidexterity, as well as the impact of different national cultural contexts on these relationships. Additionally, longitudinal studies could examine the long-term consequences of these practices for organizational performance and societal impact.          References Abo-Murad and Abdullah, 2019 M.
