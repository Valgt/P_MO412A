The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) is facing several hurdles, e.g., lack of data, insufficient research methods, and uneven development, in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 [1] . Aside from global issues, such as food crises, climate change, and reverse globalization, there are also many challenges in governance, capacity, and a lack of comprehensive engagement of stakeholders that all interplay to limit informed policies that could ensure sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated these limitations, either diverting attention or slowing progress towards these goals. Furthermore, monitoring progress towards the SDGs is difficult due to unavailable or inaccessible data, as many developing countries lack basic health, social, and economic data [2] . The United Nations therefore actively advocates for investment in data and promotes the adoption of science and technology to facilitate implementation of the 2030 Agenda around the world. The rapid development of science and technology has already led to social changes, and the issues of development opportunities and risks of new divides are now becoming the focus of discussion. The United Nations Technology Facilitation Mechanism, therefore, aims to improve international engagement through multistakeholder collaboration and cooperation to advise policy and share knowledge, information, experiences, and practices. “The ‘Space2030’ Agenda: space as a driver of sustainable development” [3] , a resolution adopted in 2021 by the United Nations General Assembly, recognizes “space tools” to be highly relevant in accomplishing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Earth observation data from satellites provide spatial attributes relevant to understanding essential issues of the Earth ecosystem, which are immensely critical for solving sustainability challenges [4]  and additionally provide new opportunities to facilitate data-driven policy and decision-making support [5] . To better fulfill the growing data needs and to improve global data coverage for SDG applications, the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), developed and operated by the International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals (CBAS), was launched on 5 November 2021. The satellite is specifically dedicated to collecting data related to the SDGs [6] . Data from SDGSAT-1 will not only support scientific applications but will also serve the UN Member States by filling in data gaps and creating a reliable stream of information relevant to achieving the SDGs. SDGSAT-1 is equipped with three advanced sensors: a thermal infrared spectrometer, glimmer imager, and multispectral imager. The technical specifications of SDGSAT-1 is shown in Table 1  . Aiming to precisely depict traces of anthropic activity, SDGSAT-1 can acquire multitype, high-precision data through its three sensors to maximize usage for a variety of SDG applications, especially SDG indicators representing human-nature interactions. The thermal infrared spectrometer has the ability to detect temperature differences with an accuracy of NEDT (noise equivalent differential temperature) less than 0.041 K @ 300 K at a spatial resolution of 30 m, in contrast with 0.047 K @ 300 K at a spatial resolution of 100 m for Landsat, and 0.05 K @ 300 K at a spatial resolution of 1000 m for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It is useful for detecting surface parameters, such as thermal radiation intensity, temperature field distribution, water temperature, and heat sources. Therefore, it has great advantages in the observation of glacial variations, ecosystem changes, and port activity. The glimmer imager adopted an innovative design employing color bands in addition to a panchromatic band, a feature applied for the first time in spaceborne nighttime light sensors. The spatial resolution of the color bands is 40 m, and that of the panchromatic band is 10 m (vs 130 m for Luojia-1 and 750 m for VIIRS onboard the Suomi NPP satellite). The glimmer imager can pick up low-light data used in detecting nighttime urban population, human activity, spatial estimation of social and economic development, power consumption assessment, as well as snow and ice during polar nights. The multispectral imager specializes in monitoring coastal and land environments, urban area function identification, artificial construction, and the intensity and concentration of human activity due to its ability to detect land cover change. It is equipped with two deep blue bands designed to identify water composition in a variety of water bodies, such as offshore ocean water and lakes, as well as a red edge band to monitor vegetation growth on land. SDGSAT-1 has a swath width of 300 km for its three sensors (vs 185 km for Landsat) to ensure more efficient global data collection. The multi-mode capacity of SDGSAT-1 allows the synergetic operation of its three sensors 24 h a day, with the multispectral imager collecting data in daylight, the glimmer imager working at night, and the thermal infrared spectrometer operating day and night, simultaneously with or independent of the other sensors. The simultaneous operation of two sensors makes it possible to observe the same ground object at the same time under the same circumstances, improving consistency of information on subjects from different sensors and enabling a more comprehensive analysis. Although the multispectral and glimmer imagers cannot operate at the same time, they provide the opportunity to utilize the spectral response difference from objects on the ground to characterize their changes between day and night. The SDGSAT-1 sensors work together to provide multiple types of data for various SDG indicators at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and the data is valuable in conducting research on population (SDG 1), agriculture (SDG 2), well-being estimation (SDG 3) [7] , economic livelihoods (SDG 4), water quality (SDG 6), informal settlements (SDG 11), climate-related hazards and natural disasters (SDG 13), and coastal environments and terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 14, 15). The data acquired by SDGSAT-1 are available free-of-charge to the scientific community around the world via the SDGSAT-1 Open Science Program (https://www.sdgsat.ac.cn ) launched in September 2022. Fig. 1 a–c is chromatic glimmer (10-m image merged from panchromatic and color data), multispectral, and thermal infrared images, respectively, taken over Beijing by the three sensors onboard SDGSAT-1. The glimmer image (Fig. 1  a) shows a dazzling scene at night, including the distribution of light sources, the illumination intensity, and color of lights, which can all be utilized to map the urban road network, the division of functional areas, and the distribution of human settlements and activity. The glimmer data can also be used to estimate and distinguish the levels of economic development, which can be inferred from the color and distribution of the light source. In the multispectral image (Fig. 1 b), the overall layout and distribution of the city, the characteristics of ground features and surface coverage, and the urban road network and transportation infrastructure are clearly visible. The thermal infrared image (Fig. 1 c) is capable of mapping thermal energy distribution, concentration of urban residential areas, and active heat source areas, and is helpful in understanding socioeconomic activity and environmental circumstances. The sub-images in Fig. 1 a–c show the details of the Bird Nest, Water Cube, and their surroundings, demonstrating the capabilities of SDGSAT-1 to thoroughly detect the same object on Earth’s surface via its three advanced sensors simultaneously. Fig. 1 d–f is color composites of night-light images of Paris, Dubai, and Hong Kong, respectively. Using these images, the layout of the cities can be clearly identified in contrast to the surrounding rivers, coastal areas, and vegetation. Fig. 1 g, h is images captured by the multispectral imager over the Yellow River Estuary and Lake Taihu in China, respectively. With the ability to capture information with two deep blue bands, the multispectral imager can accurately reflect characteristics of water that are important for studying SDG 14. The image of the Yellow River Estuary shows the state of gradual mixing and blending of the river and sea water, and the topography of the seabed and direction of the sea water can also be identified from the trends of the river water after flowing into the sea. The image of Lake Taihu shows that water in the northern part and bays appears much clearer than the cloudy major waterbody of the lake, which suggests that sediment accumulated at the lake surface due to heavy winds at the time the image was captured. The cyanobacterial blooms are detected in the north-central, southern, and east-central parts of the lake. The urbanization layout and vegetation around the lake are also clearly visible. Fig. 1 c, i is images captured by the thermal infrared spectrometer over Beijing and the Aksu region in China, respectively. The image of Aksu, unlike the more urbanized Beijing, better presents the thermal characteristics of several natural features, supporting its utility for research related to SDG 13, SDG 15, and other indicators. Fig. 1 j–l is false color images of Lake Poyang in China collected by the multispectral imager of SDGSAT-1 in November 2021, April 2022, and September 2022. The series of imagery records the water body changes of the lake. As shown in Fig. 1 j, the lake was in a low-water period. With the arrival of the flood season in the Yangtze River Basin, the coverage of water bodies (the area in blue colors in Fig. 1 k) increased tremendously, and the lake was in a high-water period. Hit by severe heat waves in the summer of 2022, the lake suffered from an extreme drought, where a major part of the lake dried up and the bottom of the lake was exposed, identified as the white area in Fig. 1 l. Fig. 1 m–o is images near Maly Taymyr Island, Russia, close to the Arctic, captured by thermal infrared sensors onboard MODIS, Landsat 9, and SDGSAT-1 on 27 April 2022 with an interval of only several hours. The three images show the same temperature distribution patterns in this area, while more accurate information of the water bodies, sea ice, and sea ice leads, such as temperature variation and shape details, are gradually recognized by Landsat 9 and SDGSAT-1 compared to MODIS. With the highest spatial and radiometric resolutions among them, SDGSAT-1 shows much better performance in detecting the thermal radiation intensity and detailed texture of the environment. In June 2022, during the High-level Dialogue on Global Development, China acknowledged the global challenges for sustainable development and urged joint efforts to build an international consensus on development, while reiterating its commitment to support the 2030 Agenda (https://en.cppcc.gov.cn/2022-06/27/c_784447.htm ). China also announced its plan to initiate a Sustainable Development Satellite Constellation Program to collect and share SDG data and information with all countries to support their efforts (https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022–06-25/Chair-s-statement-at-the-High-level-Dialogue-on-Global-Development-1b8ZW9ekqmA/index.html ), which was one of the 32 deliverables of the event. CBAS will be at the forefront of the effort to develop the SDG satellite constellation with the motivation to contribute our efforts to “Enhance space-derived economic benefits and strengthen the role of the space sector as a major driver of sustainable development”, which is the first overarching objective of the Space2030 Agenda. CBAS’ efforts are directed toward addressing the growing demand for spatial information, improving capacity for Earth observation as a digital solution for SDGs, and providing new knowledge and data for research and development. Building upon SDGSAT-1, the SDG satellite constellation is expected to:(1) Mitigate global data gaps on SDGs. According to the United Nations Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDG indicators (IAEG-SDGs), more than 41% of indicators are in Tier II or Tier III, which means the data to support these indicators are not regularly available [8] . The planned SDG satellite constellation is expected to collect a stable stream of global data to fill in the data gaps [9] . These reliable data will also enable the development of an automated process to generate timely and economical information in support of achieving SDGs.  (2) Facilitate and incentivize data analytics and technology companies to provide data-driven business strategies and solutions for businesses on SDG-related challenges for those operating in developing countries, thereby providing an important foundation for access to frontier technologies.  (3) Empower cloud-based data analysis systems to strengthen science-technology-policy frameworks within local governance structures in developing countries, which may lack the financial resources to develop indigenous data analysis systems [10] . Based on this data, public digital SDG products could help bridge the global digital information divide [11] . Promoting these mechanisms will also help improve information outreach to enhance public participation and support the realization of SDGs.  (4) Provide spatiotemporal attributes for global processes and systems that can prove to be valuable in data interoperability with other sources of big data to enable a more comprehensive evaluation of complex processes [12] .  (5) Provide valuable data about Earth systems for environment-related SDGs, helping to improve their geographic coverage and provide internationally comparable country-level datasets [13,14] . This will be particularly useful for SDG indicators that require an understanding of the Earth system, such as carbon, water, and energy cycling in terrestrial ecosystems [15] .    As the world moves further off track in meeting the SDGs, data is being widely recognized as a strategic asset to facilitate progress and understand challenges. Unfortunately, the lack of qualified and timely datasets and methodologies hinders optimistic expectations. Within this context and considering the growing relevance and reliability of Earth observation data from satellites within science and research, CBAS launched SDGSAT-1 to develop high-resolution, multi-scale global public data to support policy and decision support systems for sustainable development. To accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, new SDG satellites are being planned to launch into orbit to construct a satellite constellation, which will help provide a continuous stream of data on the Earth system and human-environment interactions to enable multi-scale data support to policymakers and fill in data gaps.
