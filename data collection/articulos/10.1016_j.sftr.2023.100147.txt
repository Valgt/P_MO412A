                  This study examines the perceptions of students about SDG localization in Zimbabwean universities. The study uses a mixed methods research design. The results reveal that students perceive the SDGs as significant in university curricula. Only 39 % confirm satisfactory or high coverage of SDGs content in their curricula. SDGs familiarity varies per discipline. Various challenges inhibit the localization of SDGs in universities. Lack of resources is the key factor. The study concludes that universities in Zimbabwe have not yet localized the SDGs to an 'acceptable or better' level. The study highlights the possibility of improving the pace of SDGs localization.

This study examines the perceptions of students about SDG localization in Zimbabwean universities. The study uses a mixed methods research design. The results reveal that students perceive the SDGs as significant in university curricula. Only 39 % confirm satisfactory or high coverage of SDGs content in their curricula. SDGs familiarity varies per discipline. Various challenges inhibit the localization of SDGs in universities. Lack of resources is the key factor. The study concludes that universities in Zimbabwe have not yet localized the SDGs to an 'acceptable or better' level. The study highlights the possibility of improving the pace of SDGs localization.

To put the Brutland report into action, eight quantifiable Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were established in September 2000, with targets for 2015 [2] . The evaluation of MDGs in 2015 culminated in the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which has an extensive plan of action based on three axes: people, the planet and prosperity [3 ,4 ]. The SDGs present a set of priority actions for addressing social, economic, and environmental challenges. To achieve the SDGs, an inclusive approach must be adopted that allows the participation of all stakeholders, including government institutions, individuals, and nongovernmental actors, among others, needs to be adopted [5 ,6 ]. To this end, institutions of higher learning institutions are key in this process as they contribute significantly to the capacitation of human resources responsible for SDG action. Through their fundamental functions, universities have a moral responsibility to develop future citizens and develop a more sustainable and engaged world [7] . Future leaders and professionals from all walks of life must have the knowledge and tools to solve sustainability predicaments. It is the responsibility of higher education systems to provide technical and theoretical knowledge, as well as motivation and encouragement, to achieve this. In addition to increasing their academic knowledge and technical skills, universities are obliged to develop student behaviours toward a more sustainable society. The need for knowledge about SDGs and the capacity to implement activities of sustainable development (pro-SD) among students cannot be overemphasized. In Southern Africa, universities have been actively involved in programs aligned with the SDGs, including the participation of university professors on global platforms in the development of the goals [8] . Some universities have even established portfolios that focus on sustainability issues [9] . Others have SDGs portals that are frequently updated to show progress in the localisation of SDGs [8] . Resultantly, there was a 40 % increase in the world ranking of African universities world ranking on SDGs in 2021 [10] . In view of the proliferation of sustainability challenges on the African continent, it is imperative that local universities, in addition to their current SDG initiatives, promote critical reflective thinking of students on complex issues of sustainable development. In this regard, several universities are working to integrate SDGs into their institutions, including their undergraduate and postgraduate curricula [6 ,11 ,12 ]. However, the current state of knowledge and familiarity with SDGs among university students remains veiled in obscurity [13] . Since attaining the UN SDGs is crucial and urgent, more academics are studying them from the point of view of higher education [14 ,15 ]. In the sphere of higher education, students are the primary stakeholders and their opinions count. However, to our knowledge, there is a dearth of empirical research that expressly examines the current state of the implementation of the SDGs in Zimbabwe from a student perspective. Consequently, the voice of the key stakeholder is silent, perpetuating policy and strategy gaps that may potentially stifle the localization of the SDGs. This study aims to contribute to the resolution of this problem by investigating the status quo of implementation of the SDGs from the student's perspective. Despite the increase in SDG activities in African universities over time, it remains unclear whether university students’ knowledge of SDGs and their ability to implement pro-SD actions are satisfactory to drive the sustainable development agenda [9] . To that extend, [9]  observed that students in open and distance learning institutions are not directly involved in university projects that advance the localization of SDGs. In other conventional universities, there is no evidence of significant active student participation in SDG-related interventions. The absence of empirical studies on the perception of Southern African university students of SDGs creates a void in understanding the current situation with respect to the role of universities in the preparation of future generations to actively address sustainability issues. This creates scope for the assessment of the knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes toward SDGs in African universities. Zimbabwe is one of the countries that has experienced economic setbacks for decades, which has put its capacity to advance systems that contribute to the achievement of the SDGs under strain. Consequently, universities have faced constraints in advancing the 2030 development agenda [16] . Lack of financial resources has been cited as a key factor. As a result, the country's universities did not feature in the world rankings for SDGs, as they have not fully aligned their activities with SDGs [17] . This has potential implications for students’ understanding of SDGs. As it stands, the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of Zimbabwean university students towards the SDGs remain sketchy. This poses challenges on the policy and strategic pathway as the nation tries to enhance the capacity of universities to contribute to the global development agenda. Therefore, the present study seeks to examine the percipience of the SDGs among university students, with the view of understanding the current extent of localization in institutions of higher learning institutions. The study sets out 3 hypotheses as follows: (1) University students in Zimbabwe perceive the implementation of SDGs in their institutions as satisfactory or better; (2) Student awareness of SDGs is significantly correlated with the familiarization of university teachers with SDGs; (3) University students perceive the localization of SDGs to be affected by several barriers beyond the control of their teachers. The study assumes that teacher scholarly output on the SDGs and field-weighted impact of citations are proxy indicators for teacher familiarity with the SDGs. The next section reviews the literature to put the purpose and hypotheses of the investigation in context in line with existing findings from previous studies. This will be followed by a section which presents the methodological framework used in the study. The final section will focus on the results and discussion, followed by conclusions of the study.  2 Review of the literature 2.1 Sustainable development goals and HEIs: An overview The concept of sustainable development has been evolving ever since and has the power to influence institutions and social norms aimed at striking a balance between the social, economic, and environmental aspects of development [2 ,4 ] . Since the 1980s, this theme has come a long way and with the introduction of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, it became extremely well-known [3] . The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by world leaders representing 193 nations at the UN General Assembly (UNGA), lays out a global framework to guide humankind toward a sustainable course [18 ,19 ]. It considers a set of 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 indicators and offers an action plan for people, prosperity, and the promotion of peace through the formation of partnerships between various sectors and nations [3] . Among the entities tasked with carrying out this Agenda, the UN guidelines note that several actors are leading players in this process, well-known for their roles as governments, corporations, academic institutions, and civil society in the context of the SDGs. For all parties involved, the higher education ecosystem plays an important role. Numerous studies [20–23]  emphasize how crucial this industry is in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Higher Education institutions (HEIs) are strategic in terms of education, research, outreach and management for sustainable development [24 ,25 ]. In addition, they have a duty to educate the public about their responsibilities and equip future professionals with the knowledge and abilities needed to address the issues of sustainable development's issues [26 ,27 ]. In view of the certitude that the entire world is collaborating to achieve the SDGs, universities have an unprecedented opportunity to teach and conduct research on specific SDGs while pursuing their "third mission" of collaborating with society and external stakeholders. However, many higher education institutions in Africa are still lagging behind [13 ,28 ]. The multi-stakeholder approach, which is considered instrumental in the achievement of the SDGs, provides the platform for universities and other higher learning institutions to contribute significantly through capacity building. Specifically, their role in the implementation of the SDGs is based on their teaching and learning activities at all levels, including adult education, student clubs, associations, online learning, undergraduate teaching, executive courses, professional training, and graduate training [29] . Higher Education institutions (HEIs) receive direct and indirect benefits for participating in the localisation of SDGs [3 ,25 ,30 ]. Most of the benefits are aligned with the impact that their activities will have on society, both at local and global level [28] . For example, a healthy society, a sustainable environment, partnerships, a habitable climate, among others, will reciprocate with benefits for institutions and their stakeholders. In addition to the benefits foreseen in the implementation of the SDGs, universities have a moral responsibility to ensure that there is adequate human resource capacity to pursue specific SDGs in their total implementation and impact within their localities. University students at all levels have a pivotal role in the whole matrix, as they are the trainees whose capacity must be built to ensure that they are qualified and adequately skilled to implement the SDGs aligned with their various fields of specialisation. However, more work needs to be done to understand how the most important stakeholders of universities, students, especially in developing countries such as Zimbabwe, perceive the teaching, implementation and monitoring of the SDGs within their institutions of higher learning [30] . Despite the deluge of challenges related to the localisation of the SDGs in HEIs and the lack of a clear understanding of the status quo of the localisation status quo [16] , acknowledge that there has been substantial progress with regard to initiatives for the integration of sustainable development into university systems. A number of scholars [31–33] , have observed that there is a general positive move towards a holistic and systemic approach by universities with regards to the integration of SDGs in their DNAs. However, some developing countries such as Zimbabwe [14 ,15 ], claim that there is still a huge vacuum with regard to the localisation of SDGs in the higher education system. However, the claim that there is a lack of SDG localisation in higher education in developing countries is unsubstantiated due to the lack of empirical investigation of the status quo of implementation. Worse still, little research has been done from the perspective of students, who are the key stakeholders in the education system. In view of this gap, this study interrogates the status quo from a student's perspective.  2.2 Knowledge of the students and attitude towards the SDGs Understanding student knowledge and attitude towards the SDGs is the sine qua non  in determining the status quo at institutions of higher learning institutions. Several studies have already focused on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of university students with regard to SDGs. Al-Naqbi and Alshannag assessed knowledge, attitudes and behaviour (KAB) of university students in the United Arab Emirates, including secondary teachers preservice towards Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and the environment. These studies had teachers, pre-service or in-service, as their respondents. This excluded the perceptions of the students. Olsson et al. assessed the sustainability consciousness of grade six and nine students in Sweden. Michalos et al. examined the KAB of grade 10 students in Manitoba. Ekantini and Wilujeng investigated the scientific literacy of students relevant to environmental SD in Indonesia. Amran et al. analysed attitudes and environmental awareness of high school students in Indonesia. The general findings of these studies indicate that several countries and learning institutions are employing a diversity of approaches to inculcate the knowledge of the SDGs in their students, a sign of enormous efforts towards the localisation of the SDGs. The studies indicated above focused on students at their basic level of education. The need to focus on university students, who have a more focused career trajectory cannot be overemphasized. In addition to this need, little has been done with regard to African universities in general and Zimbabwean institutions, in particular [34] . Furthermore, investigating the status quo on implementation of the SDGs from the perspective of students in the Zimbabwean context would contribute to the existing body of knowledge that, in turn, would facilitate relevant intercultural and cross-cultural research studies, among others. The next section focuses on the materials and methods applied to generate and analyze the data for this publication.   3 Materials and methods 3.1 Study area The study was carried out in Zimbabwe, a landlocked country in southern Africa with a population size of about 15.2 million people [35] . The country sits on top of an expansive high inland plateau that descends to the Zambezi valley, where Zambia's border is, and the Limpopo valley, where South Africa's border is, in opposite directions. The country shares borders with Botswana (813 km), Mozambique (1231 km), South Africa (225 km), and Zambia (797 km), and at its farthest western point, it almost touches Namibia. More details on the universities included in the study are presented in Fig. 1  . The universities indicated include the following: Great Zimbabwe University (GZU), Midlands State University (MSU), Lupane State University (LSU), Chinhoyi State University (CUT), Zioga Ezekiel Guti University (ZEGU) and the National University of Science and Technology (NUST). The implementation of the SDGs in the country is mainly supported by the United Nations  (UN) through the Zimbabwe United Nations Development Assistance Framework (ZUNDAF). The framework encompasses six result areas, namely: Gender equality, Poverty reduction, Value addition, Food and Nutrition, Public administration and governance, and Social services and protection. The UN provides routine monitoring and reporting on the progress made toward the SDGs at the national and subnational levels, as well as to the Zimbabwean government. It also facilitates national and local consultations and advocacy campaigns on mainstreaming and implementing the SDGs in partnership with stakeholders from different sectors.  3.2 Research design The study used the triangulation, convergence model of the mixed methods research approach. The design (Fig. 2  ) employs various, but complementary data collection and analysis methods on the same topic to gain a comprehensive understanding of the research problem [36] . In line with the procedure demonstrated in Fig. 3  , questionnaires were used to collect data from university students (n  = 1199). The data collection tool was elaborated based on questions from numerous authenticated and peer reviewed surveys. It had 33 questions categorised into 4 sections as follows: Section A: Demographic information; Section B: SDGs Awareness; Section C: SDGs Activities; and Section D: Opportunities, Priorities and Gaps Please see Appendix 1 for the questionnaire. The Cronbach's alpha was calculated to assess the internal consistency and validity of each construct in the questionnaire. This alpha is computed as follows:α = ( K K − 1   )  ( S y − ∑ s i   2  2  S y 2   )      Where α = Cronbach alpha  K = Number of items  S2  = Variance between items    For knowledge and perceptions regarding Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) among higher education students in Zimbabwe, the Cronbach's alpha values were found to be 0.77 and 0.81 respectively. The desirable α was 0.7. The constructs in this context were considered consistent and reliable. The survey was administered on the QuestionPro platform using a pre-loaded questionnaire on mobile devices. In some cases, an electronic link to the survey was shared with potential respondents to allow them to participate using their own mobile devices. Each survey took an average of 12 min to complete. In addition to questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews (n  = 31) were used to collect qualitative data from deans, department heads, student representatives, and other senior university staff members. See Appendix 2 for the interview guide. Other key informants in the study included authorities from the Zimbabwe Council of Higher and Tertiary Education (ZIMCHE) (n  = 1), Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development (MHESTD) (n  = 1) and vice chancellors of universities (n  = 6). On average, each interview lasted 45 min. The questions used to understand the student's perceptions of the SDGs include the following:• How would you describe the level of self-driven participation of students in activities related to SDGs at your university?  • How would you describe the aptitude and attitude of the students towards the content related to the SDGs of the curricula?  • Please describe the level of interest in the content of the SDGs and related activities among students in different disciplines.    Both questionnaire and interview-based data sets were supplemented with secondary and archival data sources, including management plans, science bulletins, and annual reports.   4 Identification and screening of participating institutions Zimbabwe has different types of higher education institutions, including universities, vocational training centres, government agencies, technical colleges, teacher colleges, and technical industrial centres, among others. This study screened the institutions to focus on the institutions that offer degree programs. Fig. 3  shows the screening process that was adopted. As shown in Fig. 3 , there are three main phases that were followed in the screening process, i.e., the identification of institutions through the parent ministry (Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, and Technology Development), the selection using 3-stage inclusion / exclusion criteria, and finally the final set of institutions to be included in the study. 4.1 Sampling A combination of convenience and census approaches was adopted as the main sampling strategies for the selection of study participants. We conveniently sought access to classes in session where the study was introduced and the link to the survey was shared with all those willing to participate. A census approach was used where all students in conveniently selected classes were given the opportunity to participate. Student social media platforms, such as WhatsApp groups, were also used to reach students. The SDGs Ambassadors helped facilitate access to the survey link by students. Table 1   shows the number of participants per institution.  4.2 Data analysis The analysis procedure included data preparation, where coded data was transferred from QuestionPro to excel format and categorised according to the categories of the respondents, mainly the name of the university and the discipline. Incomplete response profiles were removed. The data preparation process was followed by the calculation of descriptive statistics, including the percentages of response classes for all questions. When quantitative responses were necessary, XL Stats was used to compute the Kruskal Wallis test, analysing variations within each discipline. The Pareto analysis was used to determine the most significant barriers to the localisation of SDGs. The Pareto principle states that 80 % of problems can be traced back to 20 % of the causes [37] . It is a method for gathering the information needed to set priorities. It statistically separates a small number of input variables that have the greatest influence on an outcome [38] . Modern Pareto analysis applications are used to determine which issues cause the most problems within various departments, organizations, or sectors of a business [39] . In this study, it is adopted to determine the barriers that cause most of the localisation challenges of the SDGs. The process involved the classification of barriers and the plotting of a custom combo chart to determine the barriers that contribute 80 % of the challenges, according to the views of the students. The study used regression analysis to determine the relationship between teachers’ familiarity with SDGs and SDGs content coverage in the curricula they teach. The assumption was that teachers’ familiarity with SDGS will influence inclusion of SDGs content in the modules they prepare and teach. Consequently, students will gain SDGs knowledge and familiarity from the prepared content. Teachers’ familiarity was computed based on SDGs scholarly output and field weighted citation impact of outputs for each SDG. The data was obtained from Scival, a research analytic tool for measuring metrics extracted from the Scopus dataset. It is an Elsevier product which offers quick, easy access to the SDGs research performance of over 8500 research institutions and 220 nations worldwide [40] . SDGs content coverage was measured based on scoring of students’ perceptions on SDGs content coverage.   5 Conceptual framework The study is based on the conceptual framework shown in Fig. 4  . University teachers’ efforts to study and publish scholarly work on SDGs determine the field-weighted citation impact and their level of awareness and familiarization with SDGs. However, certain conditions enhance or become a barrier to teachers’ efforts to acquire SDGs knowledge through scholarly work. For example, access to library facilities, access to funds for research projects, and attendance of SDGs workshops can work to enhance scholarly outputs. The lack of access to these will also become a barrier to the localization of SDGs. The teaching and practical exercises conducted by university teachers transfer the knowledge to the students, enhancing their awareness and familiarization with the SDGs. However, there are barriers and enhancers of the knowledge acquisition process as well. Examples include students’ lack of access to SDGs materials for further reading, lack of access to library facilities, teachers unfamiliar with SDGs and lack of resources for practical work, among others. The awareness and familiarization of students resulting from the learning and practice process (including the influence of barriers and enhancers) will determine the general perception of students about the status quo of the SDGs localization at the institution. Hence, analysing student perceptions has the potential to provide a complete picture of SDGs localization in universities. The next section presents the results of the study and discussion.  6 Results and discussions The completion rate of the student survey was considerably high, with up to 63.13 % of those approached completing it. Other sustainability knowledge studies have experienced low participation and completion rate of around 20 % although they targeted bigger populations [41] . Studies that achieved 50 % of student participation are among those considered to have achieved high respondent participation [6] . Thus, the response rate in this study is highly acceptable. The high response rate, compared to other studies, could have been due to the participation of institutional-based ambassadors for SDGs who helped to mobilize students to participate. This strategy was adopted earlier by [6]  who involved teachers in promoting survey participation during lectures. Most of the respondents were between 18 and 24 years old (70.25 %). About 23.29 % were between 25 and 34 years old, while 4.67 % were between 35 and 44 years old. The remaining 1.9 % was over 45 years old. Age is considered an important factor in assessing sustainability knowledge, as generational differences can explain preferences and concerns [41] . Regarding gender, 56.27 % of the respondents were women, while 43.17 % were men. The remaining 0.56 % did not wish to disclose their gender. Ten disciplines across the six participating universities were represented in the survey, with Social Sciences (33.8 %) and Earth, Environmental, and Natural Sciences (16.24 %) having the highest number of respondents. The study could not control the number of participants per discipline given the inherent discipline-based disparities in admissions from universities in Zimbabwe. These demographic data can be important determinants of perceptions and knowledge of the SDGs. Therefore, in some cases, the results of this study are interpreted within the framework of the academic provenance and status of the respondents. 6.1 Importance of knowledge of SDGs in HEIs The study examined the perceptions of higher education students in Zimbabwe regarding the importance of SDG knowledge among students, academic staff, and non-teaching members of the university community. The results indicate that 27.96 % of university students in Zimbabwe strongly feel that knowledge of the SDGs is important for university students. Most of them (about 42.57 %) agree with the notion that university students really need education on SDGs. About 11.20 % of the students indicated that they are not sure about the importance of SDG knowledge among university students, as they could neither agree nor disagree. Another segment of the respondents (16.48 %) strongly feels that it is not important for university students to have knowledge about SDGs. A paltry 1.79 % agree with the notion. Regarding university teaching staff, the majority of study participants (more than 74 %) are of the view that teaching staff must have knowledge about the SDGs. About 30.1 % of them have a strong view regarding this notion, while about 44 % simply agree with the notion. Some of the students (10.51 %) could neither agree nor disagree, while 13.49 % strongly feel that SDG knowledge is of no use among teaching staff. A small percentage (1.8 %) simply disagrees with the view that the knowledge of the SDGs can be useful among university teaching staff. Fig. 4  presents the number of respondents according to their perceptions of the importance of understanding SDGs among university students and teaching staff. As shown in Fig. 5  , most students feel that the knowledge of SDGs is significant within higher learning institutions among both students and staff members. A greater number agree with this notion, whilst others strongly feel about it. About 100 respondents have shown indifference regarding the importance of SDGs knowledge, while more than 120 respondents strongly feel that neither teaching staff nor students require knowledge about SDGs. The recognition of the importance of the SDGs is a proxy indicator of the awareness of university students about the SDGs. They would not indicate the importance of a concept or concepts they are not aware of. This implies that at some point most of the students had exposure to SDG information. Although this study did not investigate the source of the SDGs information, the observation of an increase in SDGs information with the level of study points to the fact that most of the awareness was obtained through learning and other related activities. However, the wide-spread existence of SDGs information in social media outlets, UN websites, magazines, and other sources might have given exposure to some of the university students, not necessarily that the exposure is solely attributed to their curricula. Previous studies among university students in Spain [6] , and Japan [42]  have also shown that university students obtain information about the SDGs through social networks and other sources in addition to learning through their curricula. However, several studies across different universities [12 ,32 ,43 ,44 ] have indicated the university curricula are the main source of information on the SDGs among university students. There is a possibility that the few students that strongly disagree, disagree, and remained neutral might not have had a chance of exposure to adequate SDGs information, a situation that could have been driven by other factors including the socio-economic background. This is in line with [31]  who found that demographic factors influence exposure and perceptions towards sustainable development concepts. This study notes that the acknowledgement of the importance of SDGs in their learning by students, as well as by university teaching and non-teaching staff, shows a positive attitude towards SDGs. They believe that SDGs have an important role to play in the human development matrix. The positive attitude towards the SDGs provides a fertile ground for the development of SDG-focused modules or SDGs aligned module content.  6.2 Content of the SDGs in academic programmes The study investigated students’ perceptions about the content of the SDGs in their current programmes. The lead question was 'How would you evaluate the coverage of the following SDGs in your programme?'  Their current programmes were evaluated based on content coverage for the 17 SDGs. The results represent a mixture of opinions. Utilizing a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1=very poor, 2=poor, 3=neutral, 4=good, 5=very good) and summing up all responses across the 17 SDGs, the highest number of responses (n  = 5293; 18.39 %) leaned towards neutrality. Conversely, the lowest number (n  = 1363; 8.83 %) strongly disagreed with the idea that the current curricula adequately cover the SDGs. About 3, 956 (25.63 %) responses indicated agreement with the notion, while 1986 (12.87 %) show that they strongly agree with this view. The remaining 18.39% (n  = 2838) disagreed with the notion. Table 2   shows further details on the perceptions of the respondents about the inclusion of each of the 17 SDGs content in their curricula. As shown in Table 2 , a Kruskal-Wallis test was calculated to test whether the responses categories (1,2,3,4,5) have an effect on overall perception for each of the 17 SDGs according to different disciplines assessed in this study. The test revealed that there is a significant difference (p <0.05) between the response categories for all SDGs for most disciplines. However, for SDG 12, all disciplines, except education, do not have significant differences (p > 0.05). For SDGs 16 and 17, the disciplines of humanities, medical and health sciences, and veterinary science also do not have a significant difference (p >0.05). Although there are some instances where some disciplines show no significant differences in terms of response categories, most disciplines show a significant difference. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was also used to determine whether there are significant differences in the classes by looking at all SDGs. The calculated p -value (0.0001) is lower than the significance alpha (0.050), showing that there is a significant difference. It is clear from these results that students perceive content coverage differently, with most of them (35 %) indicating that they are not sure (neutral). There is also quite a significant number of respondents indicating that they agree (26 %) and others strongly agree (13 %). Some respondents feel that the curriculum does not have an SDG content (18.5 % disagree and 8 % strongly disagree). Differences in opinion could be influenced by factors such as the type of discipline, different levels of exposure among teaching staff, and sociodemographic factors, among others. Our overall evaluation indicates that the content on SDGs is generally not satisfactory as approximately 61 % of the respondents disagree, strongly disagree, or are neutral. Only 39 % agree or strongly agree. This is evidence that Zimbabwean universities must increase their focus on aligning the content of curricula with the global development agenda. It emerges that SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 5 (gender equality) have fewer than 20 % of the respondents who believe that the coverage in current curricula is poor and/or very poor. SDG 6 (Safe drinking water and sanitation) has slightly more than 20 % of respondents claiming the same. In terms of content taught in university programs, the three SDGs (4, 5, and 6) dominate the other SDGs. About 18.4 % of the respondents indicated that the content of SDG 5 in the curricula was very good. The same is true for SDGs 4 and 6, which have a higher percentage of respondents who said their content was very good. With a high acceptability score, SDG 13 (climate action) appears to be popular as well. Approximately 15.68 % of the respondents said that the content on climate action is very good. SDGs 2 (zero hunger), SDG 8 (effective work and economic growth), and SDG 14 (life below water) are the least covered in the curricula. For example, SDG 14 has close to 40 % of the respondents claiming that its coverage in curricula content is poor and/or very poor. Only 7.2 % consider the content to be very good. However, a significant percentage of university students (34.93 %) believe that its coverage in the curricula can be classified as neutral. SDG 2 has about 34.47 % of the respondents indicating that the coverage is poor and/or very poor, while only 7.85 % opined that the content coverage for this SDG is very good. About 34.95 % of the respondents are of the view that the content of SDG 8 in their curriculum is poor and/or very poor while only 10.8% claim that the content is very good. The university curricula are an important source of SDGs information, if universities lack in this aspect, future development will be affected as these students are the leaders and decision makers in the near future. Studies done in China [44] , Spain [6] , and Japan [42]  indicate university curricula are the main source of knowledge and skills related to the SDGs among university students. Therefore, there is an urgent need to place an emphasis on teaching SDGs in universities. It is possible that the variation in opinion regarding content coverage among university students could be influenced by other factors, including the discipline of study. This observation provided scope to examine the discipline-specific familiarisation and implementation of specific SDGs. The next section looks at the familiarization and implementation of the SDGs in Zimbabwean universities.  6.3 Familiarisation with and implementation of the SDGs Based on all responses across disciplines, a mean SDGs familiarisation score was computed for all disciplines. A total of 10 disciplines were included in the analysis. For each SDG, the discipline with the highest familiarization score was determined. Table 3   presents the familiarisation score for each discipline across all SDGs. As shown in Table 3 , the Earth, Environmental and Natural Sciences discipline has the highest familiarisation with the SDGs in the Zimbabwean universities under study, leading all disciplines in 8 SDGs, namely SDG3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life below Water) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Education is the second highest discipline in terms of the number of SDGs in which the discipline is leading in familiarisation. The discipline is leading in 4 SDGs, namely SDG2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG 17 (Partnerships). Social sciences and law disciplines come third, each leading in two SDGs. The discipline of Social Sciences is leading in familiarization with SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). The law discipline, on the other hand, is leading in familiarisation with SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Humanities and arts are leading in SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). On the flip side, the disciplines of Engineering and Veterinary Science have the lowest familiarisation scores, each being the least familiar discipline in 5 SDGs. The Medical and Health Science discipline has the lowest familiarisation score in 4 SDGs, while Law and Agriculture have 2 and 1, respectively. The discipline of commerce remained neutral, with neither the highest nor lowest familiarisation score in any SDGs. To understand the overall performance of each discipline, looking at all SDGs, the overall knowledge and implementation scores were calculated and plotted as a spider web, as shown in Fig. 6  . Fig. 6  shows that in general education is the discipline with the highest knowledge and implementation score of the SDGs (46.24). It is closely followed by the Earth, Environmental and Natural Sciences discipline (46.15). Social sciences are third with a score of 43.21 out of 100 possible. The other disciplines (Law, Veterinary Science, Medical and Health Sciences, Commerce, Humanities and Arts, Agriculture, and Engineering) had an overall score less than 40. Considering that the possible score is 100, the results indicate that knowledge of the SDGs in local universities in Zimbabwe remains below average, reinforcing our earlier observation that the content of the curricula is not satisfactory. The differences in familiarisation and implementation of SDGs across disciplines as observed in this study confirm the findings by [21]  who also noted that there are discipline-specific preferences of certain SDGs over others. The dominance of the Earth, Environmental and Natural Sciences (EENS) discipline on the number of SDGs where student familiarisation and implementation are high could be stemming from its multidisciplinary nature. Degree programmes such as Geography and Environmental Science that fall under the EENS discipline have both human development and physical environment content that address a number of the SDGs. Therefore, university students studying these programs tend to have a greater exposure to the content of the SDGs as they focus on contemporary environmental issues, most of which are aligned with the SDGs. The discipline of education also performs well in the familiarization of students with the SDGs due to its coverage of a diversity of subjects. The different modules in this discipline focus on several different aspects, for example, economic, social, cultural, and environmental issues that span the 17 SDGs. The specialised disciplines such as Veterinary Science, Medical and Health Science, Agriculture, Law and Engineering tend to have a few students claiming that they have familiarised themselves with specific SDGs. However, this study observes that most of the scores shown in Fig. 8  are below 50 % of the possible score, implying that familiarization with the content of the SDGs needs to be improved in all disciplines if universities hope to contribute significantly in the localisation of the SDGs in the sectors of the economy.  6.4 Knowledge of the SDGs, level of study and familiarization of teachers The study examined the relationship between the familiarization of teachers with the SDGs and the perception of students of the content coverage of the curricula. SDGs scholarly outputs and the field weighted citation impact (FWCI) were used as proxy indicators for familiarisation based on the assumption that university teachers publish in areas they are familiar with and the impact of their outputs is an indication of knowledge levels. The results show that there is a disconnect between the familiarity of teachers and the coverage of the content of the SDGs in the curriculum, from the student's perspective (Fig. 7  ). As shown in Fig. 7  there is no strong relationship (r2 = 0.053) between FWCI and SDGs coverage in the curricula. Furthermore, there is no strong relationship between the academic output of the SDGs and the coverage of the SDGs content in curricula. This depicts a disconnection between the teacher's research and the teaching focus. The mean SDGs content score for all levels was calculated to determine whether the level of study is an important determinant of SDGs knowledge. The results indicate that as the level of study increases, the content of the SDGs increases. The number of years spent at university is significantly correlated (r2  = 0.886) with the SDGs knowledge score. Furthermore, the number of years spent can significantly predict the SDGs knowledge score (r2  = 0.7847). Fig. 8   shows the relationship between the level of study and the amount of content of the SDGs the student has been exposed to. As shown in Fig. 8 , at level 2 of academic studies, the average content score is about 2.77. The score increases with time until level 3 where in most programs, the students go for work related learning. At this level, there is a decrease in the SDGs content until they are in their fourth year of study. The average score for those who proceed to the fifth year is above 2.90. These results imply an accumulation of knowledge about the SDGs as one progresses on the education ladder. It also shows that modules at a higher level are probably designed to prepare the student to address some of the practical challenges faced in the world. Thus, the focus on some of the SDGs and related targets becomes important toward the completion of studies. This may not be a deliberate effort by universities to localise SDGs, but such a curricula structure helps in the localisation of SDGs.  6.5 Perceived barriers to the localization of the SDGs Based on the results of the survey, there are several perceived barriers to the localisation of SDGs in Zimbabwe's institutions of higher learninginstitutions. A total of 13 interconnected barriers were identified. It is a daunting task to try and address 13 barriers in order to improve the localisation of SDGs in higher education institutions. A Pareto analysis was used to identify the barriers that are most important. The analysis focuses on the most significant barriers that influence 80 % of the problems, while paying less attention to the numerous barriers that influence 20 % of the challenges. Fig. 9   shows that, of the 13 identified barriers, seven are critical and once addressed, the challenges associated with the dissemination of knowledge of the SDGs in universities will be significantly reduced. Fig. 9  shows 7 barriers (indicated as the few vital ones) perceived as the most pressing challenges that inhibit the localisation of the SDGs in higher education institutions in Zimbabwe. These barriers include lack of funding, poor government strategy and policies, insufficient SDG materials, poor links between universities and industry, lack of good practice cases on SDGs, insufficiently trained staff, and inadequate library facilities. According to survey data, these barriers inflict 80 % of the overall impact on the teaching and implementation of the SDGs in universities. In addition to the 7 significant barriers, the results indicate that there are other 6 barriers, namely lack of management support, uninterested and demotivated staff, lack of prioritisation of the SDGs by universities, absence of key performance indicators related to the SDGs, perceptions regarding extra work associated with the SDGs and nature of the university curricula. These factors contribute 20 % of the impact on the localisation of the SDGs. Although they are useful, they are not significant because even if they are addressed, the situation with regard to localisation of SDGs will not improve significantly. Therefore, efforts must be directed toward addressing the first seven barriers that constitute 80 % of the impact on implementation of the SDGs. The observation, by this study, of a lack of funding as the key barrier to the location of the SDGs localisation confirms findings by [14]  which indicate that the Zimbabwean economic situation does not allow universities to allocate resources to the implementation of sustainable development concepts in the current curricula. [32]  also reiterated the inability of Zimbabwean universities to prioritize SDG localisation in the absence of the necessary financial resources. In a study conducted at the university of South Africa, [33]  also identified lack of resources as one of the key barriers to the localisation of the SDGs. Most of the barriers observed in this study have root causes linked to lack of resources.   7 Conclusions This study examined student perceptions of the localization of SDGs in six Zimbabwean universities. It presents three hypotheses: (1) University students in Zimbabwe perceive implementation of the SDGs in their institutions as satisfactory or better; (2) Student awareness of the SDGs is significantly correlated with the familiarization of university teachers with the SDGs; (3) University students perceive the location of the SDGs to be affected by several barriers beyond the control of their teachers. The results show that a significant number of students understand the importance of SDGs knowledge. However, the coverage of the SDG content is generally not satisfactory. There are discipline-specific variations in the level of content of the SDGs as well as familiarisation and implementation. Science disciplines such as engineering, veterinary science, medical and health sciences and agriculture have less familiarization compared to humanities, education social sciences, and earth, environmental and natural sciences. It emerged that the scholarly outputs of teachers on the SDGs and the impact of research do not significantly influence the content of the SDGs in the curriculum, an indication of a disconnect between the focus of research and the specialization of teaching. Several challenges as barriers to the localization of SDGs in universities were highlighted. The main challenges include lack of resources, inappropriate government policy, insufficiently trained staff, lack of SDGs materials, poor university-industry links, and lack of good practice cases for SDGs. The need for new programs and curricula adjustments to increase the pace of implementation of the SDGs cannot be overemphasized. While the need to deepen SDGs knowledge is clear, it should be borne in mind that sustainability knowledge does not automatically convert into sustainability behaviour. More studies are needed to investigate the relationship between the knowledge of SDGs and sustainability behaviour to determine the impact of SDGs localisation efforts in universities. The results of this study should stimulate policy makers to reflect on the role of higher education in the framework of sustainable development. Strong higher education systems support the localization of the SDGs and students’ awareness, familiarization and implementation of the SDGs are the proxy indicators for localization or lack thereof. This study has made it clear that, to a greater extent, our future leaders are not well exposed to the global development agenda, a situation that puts the future of the nation in a precarious position. There is need to implement some content adjustments. Another option is to introduce a compulsory cross-disciplinary module on the SDGs to ensure that disciplines where the streamlining of the SDGs is not necessary may also benefit from the campus-wide module on the SDGs. The results have indicated a disconnect between the impact of the research on the SDGs of teachers and the knowledge and familiarization of the SDGs of students. We propose the introduction of a teacher assessment criterion that takes into account the alignment of research outputs with the modules taught, as well as the knowledge and familiarisation of students with SDGs. Although our study has contributed to understanding the status quo on SDGs localisation in Zimbabwean universities, it is limited because it focuses only on students. The element of biased reporting cannot be ruled out. Future studies should aim to provide a wholistic picture which considers the perceptions of all stakeholders in the higher education sector, including university management, teachers, students, and other organisations that work closely with these institutions.
