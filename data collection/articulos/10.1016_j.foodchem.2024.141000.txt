                  Food waste, accounting for about one-third of the total global food resources wasted each year, is a substantial challenge to global sustainability, contributing to adverse environmental impacts. The utilization of food waste as a valuable source for bioactive extraction can be facilitated through the application of DES (Deep Eutectic Solvents). Acknowledging the significant need to tackle this issue, the United Nations integrated food waste management into its Sustainable Development Goals, hence, the present review explores the role of DES in bioactive compounds extraction from food waste. Various extraction processes using the DES system are thoroughly studied and the application of bioactive components as antioxidants, antimicrobials, flavourings, nutraceuticals, functional ingredients, additives, and preservatives is investigated. Most importantly, regulatory considerations and safety aspects of DES in food applications are discussed in-depth along with consumer perception and acceptance of DES in the food sector. The key hypothesis of the review is to evaluate emerging DES systems for their efficiency in bioactive extraction technologies and various food applications. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of utilizing DES for synthesizing valuable food waste-derived bioactive components, offering a sustainable approach to waste management and the development of high-value products.

Food waste, accounting for about one-third of the total global food resources wasted each year, is a substantial challenge to global sustainability, contributing to adverse environmental impacts. The utilization of food waste as a valuable source for bioactive extraction can be facilitated through the application of DES (Deep Eutectic Solvents). Acknowledging the significant need to tackle this issue, the United Nations integrated food waste management into its Sustainable Development Goals, hence, the present review explores the role of DES in bioactive compounds extraction from food waste. Various extraction processes using the DES system are thoroughly studied and the application of bioactive components as antioxidants, antimicrobials, flavourings, nutraceuticals, functional ingredients, additives, and preservatives is investigated. Most importantly, regulatory considerations and safety aspects of DES in food applications are discussed in-depth along with consumer perception and acceptance of DES in the food sector.

Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions, a serious consequence of food waste mismanagement, account for 8–10 % of global emissions. Notably, this food loss and waste constitute approximately 40 % of the total food produced worldwide annually, equating to economic losses estimated at around $2.6 trillion (Lukose & Singh, 2024 ). Moreover, the United Nations has recognized the urgency of addressing food waste by incorporating it into three Sustainable Development Goals: sustainable cities and communities, sustainable consumption and production patterns, and climate action (Sravani et al., 2024 ). Additionally, food waste, primarily generated in urban environments, is a type of biomass commonly mishandled, leading to health and environmental issues. Unlike general biomass, food waste exhibits seasonal and regional properties. To achieve global environmental sustainability, a transition from the linear paradigm of food consumption and production to a circular one is imperative. This involves valorizing unavoidable residues from farming and the food industry (Piadeh et al., 2024 ; Singh et al., 2024 ). Moreover, sustainable valorization of food waste is crucial for reducing its environmental and economic burdens and advancing toward a circular economy. Biochemical and thermochemical approaches are commonly employed to convert food waste into value-added products like bioenergy and solid carbonaceous materials. However, biochemical methods face challenges such as slow conversion rates and reliance on microorganisms, necessitating precise control and additional treatments for efficient conversion (Shahzad et al., 2024 ; Tsai & Tsai, 2024 ). Addressing these challenges is essential for effectively tackling food waste and achieving sustainable development goals. DES, characterized by its simple synthesis from readily available and inexpensive raw materials, offers several advantages over traditional extraction methods in the field of food waste valorization, particularly in the extraction of bioactive compounds (Molnar et al., 2024 ). Moreover, DES, composed of eutectic mixtures with lower melting points compared to their components, exhibits low toxicity, wide solubility ranges, and affordability, making them appealing substitutes for conventional solvents (Taweekayujan et al., 2023 ; Viñas-Ospino et al., 2023 ). However, it was developed as an alternative to environmentally benign ionic liquids (ILs) to address various limitations, such as difficulty in large-scale production, non-biodegradable, and hazardous nature. Thus, the huge advantage of DESs over ILs is their non-toxicity, sustainability, and requirement of inexpensive compounds for synthesis that are easily accessible. Although ILs and DESs possess similarities in terms of physical characteristics and functionalities, as depicted in Fig. 1   (A), they are considered two distinct groups of substances from an analytical chemistry perspective (Kumar et al., 2024 ; Płotka-Wasylka et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, DES operates at lower temperatures and pressures compared to conventional extraction techniques, thereby reducing energy consumption, and preventing thermal degradation of compounds, through van der Waals forces, facilitated by hydrogen bond formation between the solvent and the compounds, thus enabling their separation from the food waste matrix (Moni Bottu et al., 2022 ; Ni et al., 2024 ). Additionally, the efficiency of polyphenol extraction using DESs is influenced by several factors, including the composition and concentration of the DES, pH, temperature, and processing time (Santos-Martín et al., 2023 ). Therefore, optimization of these extraction parameters is crucial for maximizing the yield and purity of extracted polyphenols (Fu et al., 2021 ; Airouyuwa et al., 2024 ). In this review, the potential of emerging DES for food waste valorization in alignment with sustainable development goals has been discussed. Specifically, the application of DESs in extracting bioactive compounds from food waste and utilizing them in various food applications has been explored. By highlighting the benefits of DESs, including low toxicity, wide solubility ranges, and affordability, their potential as sustainable alternatives to traditional extraction methods has been showcased. Moreover, their effectiveness in achieving higher purities and yields of bioactive compounds to reduce food waste and promote circular economy principles has been studied. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing research and emerging trends, this review provides insights into the role of DES in advancing sustainable food waste management practices and achieving broader sustainability objectives.  2 Fundamentals of DES 2.1 Characteristics and composition of DES DES is a novel category of ionic solvent systems formed from eutectic mixtures of Bronsted or Lewis alkalis and acids, encompassing a wide range of combinations, remaining liquid at room temperature (González-Campos et al., 2024 ). They consist of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) like quaternary ammonium salts, metal chlorides, carboxylates, and hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) such as alcohols, carboxylic acids, or amines, in a fixed stoichiometric ratio (Fajar et al., 2024 ; Mero et al., 2023 ). Additionally, the components of HBAs and HBDs in natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) are metabolites-derived from living cells including choline derivatives, sugars, alcohols, urea, amino acids, and organic acids (Płotka-Wasylka et al., 2020 ). Moreover, choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents (ChCl-DESs) are the most extensively investigated type of DESs for the extraction of bioactive compounds from natural sources, owing to their high solubility and selectivity in bioactive extraction. Consequently, the physicochemical properties of ChCl-DESs, including polarity and viscosity, can be optimized to meet the requirements of extraction equipment and align with the physicochemical characteristics of the target compounds (Alam et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). The natural compounds interact through various mechanisms, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions, and dipole-dipole interactions (Prabhune & Dey, 2023 ). These combinations result in DESs with remarkable thermal and chemical stability, making them highly suitable for diverse applications. Despite the potential use of expensive components in some cases, the reusability of DESs can offset overall preparation and purification costs (Abdelrahman et al., 2023 ; Bezerra et al., 2024 ). DES is categorized into type I, which is composed of organic salt and metal, type II, comprising organic salt and metal salt hydrate, type III, involving organic salt and HBD, and type IV, consisting of HBD and aluminium/zinc chloride (Khalid et al., 2024 ), where type III have gained significant importance due to their effectiveness as extraction solvents, particularly in bioactive compounds, as highlighted in a recent review by (Gullón et al., 2020 ). Additionally, natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) are classified as type I consisting of base and acid, type II involving sugar and polyalcohol or sugar, type III comprising polyalcohol or sugar and organic acid, type IV comprising of polyalcohol or sugar and organic base, and type V containing amino acids and organic acids or sugar (Hikmawanti et al., 2021 ; Satija et al., 2024 ). However, given the diverse range of potential NADES combinations for extracting bioactive compounds, several criteria must be considered to select the most efficient and suitable extraction strategy, including optimizing the extraction method and ensuring the effective recovery of the desired bioactive compounds from NADESs.  2.2 Properties and applications of DES in the food industry Conventional solvents, widely used in extraction methods, face limitations due to contamination and biological hazards, making them unsuitable for food industries, as their high toxicity levels pose risks for human consumption, further limiting their applicability (Airouyuwa et al., 2024 ). Whereas DES presents a promising alternative for the food processing industry. Unlike conventional solvents, DES is non-toxic and environmentally friendly, making it a safer option for food processing sectors, as depicted in Fig. 1  (B). Additionally, DES demonstrates efficacy in large-scale processes, further enhancing its appeal for industrial use. The development of efficient and novel techniques for preparing DES is crucial. Emerging techniques such as microwave, pulsed electric field, and sonication technology are being explored for DES synthesis (Huang et al., 2024 ). Various key attributes such as surface tension polarity, ionic conductivity, viscosity, density, and melting point, need careful evaluation throughout the development process (Kalogiouri et al., 2024 ). Understanding the correlation between the properties of DES and their composition is essential for modifying their characteristics for specific food applications. However, it is imperative to consider the additional effects of DES on processes, including potential side effects, and catalytic and inhibition impacts.  2.3 Extraction methods using DES 2.3.1 Liquid phase microextraction (LPME) LPME, a widely utilized technique for the extraction of bioactive compounds, encompasses a small volume of extracting solvent (the acceptor phase) which is typically introduced directly into the aqueous sample containing analytes (the donor phase) or into its headspace (Aktaş & Kurek, 2024 ). Subsequently, the extracting solvent is collected for further analysis. Additionally, this process allows for efficient extraction of target compounds while minimizing sample volume requirements (Lee et al., 2023 ; Mansour et al., 2024 ). Additionally, these techniques often incorporate different forms of kinetic energy, such as ultrasound-assisted microextraction (UAME) or microwave-assisted microextraction (MAME), to enhance extraction efficiency, increase enrichment factors, and concurrently reduce extraction time, as shown in Fig. 2  . Moreover, DES has emerged as a preferred solvent over conventional solvents for several reasons, as discussed earlier (Aktaş & Kurek, 2024 ). Notably, the efficiency of extraction relies on the partition coefficient, the type, and volume of both the extracting and dispersive solvents, sample volume, properties of the analyte, agitation, ionic strength, extraction time, and temperature (Balaraman et al., 2020 ; Kizil et al., 2024 ). Moreover, these factors interact dynamically to influence the extraction process, necessitating careful optimization for each specific application. Recently, Bezerra et al. (2024)  obtained chlorogenic acid (1786 mg CGA/l) from sunflower meal using a NADES composed of lactic acid and glucose at a 5:1 M ratio, processed at 30 min. In another study, (Balaraman et al., 2022 ) obtained bromelain with 87 % yield through NADES with moderate density (tetrabutyl ammonium chloride: imidazole: glycerol/sodium sulfate). Additionally, 95.10 % to 98.75 % ginkgolic acid was recovered from Ginkgo biloba  leaves through liquid-liquid microextraction pretreatment method based on hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (HDES). Furthermore, the HDES contained L-menthol as a hydrogen bond acceptor and cyclohexanol as a hydrogen bond donor at 1:1 mol/mol (Dong et al., 2023 ).  2.3.2 Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) DLLME, a modified version of LLME was created to enhance the rate of recovery in LLME (Mansour et al., 2024 ). It enhances the contact surface area between the extractant and the sample, thereby significantly improving the extraction kinetics. Subsequently, the sample undergoes centrifugation to separate the extractant and disrupt the emulsion (Kalogiouri et al., 2024 ). Moreover, dispersion can be achieved by a disperser solvent or external mechanical forces such as vortex agitation, manual shaking, magnetic stirring, microwave irradiation, and ultrasonic power (Faraji, 2024 ; Mansour et al., 2024 ; Shoshtari-Yeganeh et al., 2024 ). In a recent study, Kizil et al. (2024)  extracted chlorophyll (E140) from seaweeds and leafy green plant wastes at a 100 % recovery rate, via DES-based DLLPME, where DES contained choline chloride and urea at a 1:1 M ratio. The yield was also influenced by increasing microwave heating to 50 °C for 6 min, furthermore, the sample was also subjected to an ultrasonic bath for 5 min (Table 1  ). Additionally, (Mastellone et al., 2022 ) extracted 27.46 μg g− 1  cannabinoid A, 245.77 μg g− 1  varinic acid A, 21.26 μg g− 1  varinic acid B, 43.29 μg g− 1  varinic acid B from fiber type Cannabis  sp. through DES-based DLLPME consisting of 500 μL of methanol/water (70:30, v /v). Furthermore, methyl jasmonate with a recovery rate of 80.60–107.03 % was separated from tea (Camellia sinensis  L.) by air-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction (AALLME) with enantioselective gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Luo et al., 2023 ).  2.3.3 UAME UAME technique utilizes ultrasonic energy, typically at a frequency of 40 kHz, with ultrasonic probes offering higher energy input per volume than water baths, ensuring precise control over sonication parameters for accurate results (Mansour et al., 2024 ). It involves lower DES volumes (usually <500 μL) and a reduced extraction period (< 15  min) compared to conventional LPME. The efficiency relies on factors like ultrasonic conditions (temperature, sonication time), sample characteristics (matrix, particle size), and extracting solvent type and volume. Compared to conventional dispersive liquid-LPME (DLLPME), UAME eliminates the need for a dispersive solvent, promoting better contact between the sample and the extracting solvent. DES-based UAME is mainly used for extracting organic compounds from liquid samples, although exploration into inorganic analyte or solid sample extraction has occurred (Kaoui et al., 2023 ). In a recent study, (Cerdá-Bernad et al., 2023 ) extracted 95.66 mg GAE/gdw  total phenols and 9.56 mg CE/gdw  flavonoids from saffron floral by-products with 90 % NADESs for 20 min of treatment and UAE at 180 W. Notably, NADESs was synthesized with L-proline and glycerol at 1:2 M ratio at 65 °C for 3 h. Moreover, Yu et al. (2024) , extracted 20.2 mg/ml lycopene and 6.38 mg/ml total phenols from tomato processing by-products with ChCl/lactic acid-based DES (1:2 mol/mol, 80 °C, 60 min) through UAE at 750 W at 30 °C for 2 h (Table 1 ). The combination of choline chloride (ChCl) and lactic acid created a balanced hydrogen bonding network, and this was further facilitated by ultrasonic treatment. Consequently, the extraction efficiency was enhanced through improved mass transfer rates and the disruption of cell walls in the tomato by-products, which led to the effective release of lycopene into the DES. Additionally, carotenoid (46.01 μg/g) was obtained from orange by-products through DES-based UAE containing octanoic acid and proline at 4:1 M ratio at 65 °C for 120 W (Viñas-Ospino et al., 2023 ).  2.3.4 MAME MAME involves the utilization of non-ionizing electromagnetic irradiation, ranging from 0.3 to 300 GHz, to heat both the samples and solvent through the dipole moments of molecules, thereby accelerating extraction kinetics (Airouyuwa et al., 2024 ). Additionally, MAE can be conducted in open vessels at atmospheric pressure (focused MAE) or in closed vessels under pressure (pressurized MAE). Pressurized MAE is commonly preferred in food analysis due to its capacity to obtain enhanced extraction yields. Moreover, the efficiency of extraction depends on factors such as the solvent ratio and type, pressure, temperature, extraction time, radiation power, particle size (ideally between 0.1 and 2 mm), and sample composition (moisture content) (Tapia-Quirós et al., 2024 ). In a recent study, (Wu et al., 2024 ) extracted 26.52 mg/100 mg uronic acid and 8.62 mg GAE/100 mg bound polyphenols from thinned unripe kiwi fruits with DES, containing choline chloride and ethylene glycol at 1: 3 mol/mol. Moreover, the yield of uronic acid and total polyphenols were estimated up to 30.50 mg/100 mg and 6.64 GAE/100 mg on the DES-based MAE (640 W) extraction, which was much higher than the conventional (hot water-based) extraction (Wu et al., 2024 ). However, heteropolysaccharides (48.8 mg/ml) were procured from date pomace through DES-assisted MAE, where DES comprised of choline chloride and carboxylic acid at 1:1 M ratio at 80 °C for 15 min at 600 W (Bamigbade et al., 2024 ). In summary, DES-based extraction methods like LPME, DLLPME, MAE, and UAE offer efficient recovery of bioactive compounds from diverse sources. DESs and NADESs demonstrate versatility in extracting compounds such as chlorophyll, phenols, flavonoids, and lycopene. Integrating DES with non-conventional techniques like UAME and MAE enhances yields, reduces extraction times, and minimizes solvent usage, marking a sustainable approach to food waste valorization.   2.4 Bioactive extraction from different food waste Recovering bioactive compounds from different food waste aims at utilizing non-edible by-products and residues from agri-food production to extract valuable bioactive compounds and phytonutrients, thereby enhancing sustainability and reducing waste in the food industry (Roselli et al., 2024 ). Food waste can be broadly classified into the following categories. Additionally, food loss at the production stage includes losses during agricultural activities, such as harvesting, handling, and storage before the products reach the market (Junaid & Gokce, 2024 ; Marimuthu et al., 2024 ). Furthermore, food loss at post-harvest handling and storage encompasses losses occurring after harvest but before the product reaches the consumer, resulting from inadequate storage facilities lacking proper refrigeration or controlled-atmosphere storage, inefficient transportation with poor handling and improper temperature control, and grading and sorting processes where products not meeting standards are discarded despite being edible (Aier et al., 2024 ; Bisht & Singh, 2024 ; Manzoor et al., 2024 ). Moreover, food waste at the processing and distribution stage involves losses during processing, packaging, and distribution (Marimuthu et al., 2024 ). Finally, food waste at the consumption stage pertains to waste by consumers at home or in restaurants. Thus, the extraction of bioactive compounds from these non-edible parts represents a health-promoting and sustainable approach in the field of valorization (Amador-Cervera et al., 2024 ). Fruits and vegetable waste include polyphenols, tannins, flavonoids, flavanols, vitamins (A and E), essential minerals, fatty acids, volatiles, anthocyanins, and pigments (Maimulyanti et al., 2023 ; Marinaccio et al., 2024 ; Rajha et al., 2019 ). Additionally, animal-derived bioactive, such as peptides is notably found in whey and colostrum from the dairy industry. Furthermore, the marine sector highlights bioactive extraction from shellfish, fish processing, and seaweed. The extraction of bioactive compounds from food waste is a health-promoting and sustainable approach in the field of valorization (Benvenutti et al., 2022 ; Dikmetas et al., 2024 ). However, the sustainability of extraction technologies is critical for health, environmental, and economic considerations (More et al., 2022 ). In a recent work, 5.80 mg/g dm theobromine, 2.08 mg/g dry mass  caffeine, 0.92 mg/g dry mass  catechin, and 0.91 mg/g dry mass  epicatechins were extracted through NADESs containing choline chloride and lactic acid (1:2 mol/mol) from cocoa bean shell (Table 1 ) (Benítez-Correa et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, 32.58 mg GAE/g dry-weight  total phenolic compounds and 15.29 mg RE/g dry-weight  total flavonoids were extracted from Toona sinensis  seeds extracted through NADESs, consisting of choline chloride and oxalic acid at 2:1 mol/mol. Moreover, another bioactive compound named anthocyanin (11.40 mg cyanidin-3-glucose eq/g) and 41.56 mg GAE eq/g total polyphenols were obtained from blueberry pomace resources, with the aid of DES containing choline chloride and 1,4-butanediol (1:3 mol/mol) at 63 °C (Zhang et al., 2023 ). In another recent study, 8.29 g GAE/ 100 g phenolic compounds were extracted from dry avocado (Pers e a a mericana  Mill.) peels with DESs consisting of choline chloride and lactic acid (1:2 mol/mol) along with MAE (200 W, 15 min) (Table 1 ) (Della Posta et al., 2023 ). In conclusion, the extraction of bioactive compounds from food waste presents a promising solution for valorization, highlighting the wealth of beneficial compounds present in by-products of food industries. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of various extraction methods, such as NADESs and DESs, in obtaining various bioactive compounds from potential food wastes. These findings highlight the potential of bioactive extraction not only in enhancing the nutritional value of food waste but also in promoting sustainability by reutilizing food waste resources.   3 Applications of bioactives extracted using DES in the food industry 3.1 Antioxidants and antimicrobials DES-extracted antioxidants hold immense potential to replace synthetic preservatives and extend shelf life while potentially offering additional health benefits (Lanjekar et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2023 ). However, accurately measuring their antioxidant capacity is crucial. Two common assays, the ABTS+ (2,2′-azinobis (3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) tests provide valuable insights into the free radical scavenging abilities of the bioactive compounds (Gullón et al., 2019 ). In a recent research, 68.98 μ/g astaxanthin (ASX) was extracted from shrimp wastes through NADESs (choline chloride and lactic acid at 1:2 M ratio) based UAE (60 % ultrasound amplitude) extraction. Thus, ASX-incorporated chitosan-based biodegradable film exhibited higher radicle scavenging activity with 50 % ABTS+  and 35 % DPPH radical scavenging activity, whereas the control film revealed 40 % ABTS+  and 27 % DPPH radical scavenging property (Table 2  ) (Chandra Roy et al., 2021 ). More recently, lycopene extracted from tomato processing by-products was incorporated into chitosan film, which was used to observe the storage quality of strawberries. The polymeric film (E2-Ch/ LA-CS) containing 20 mg/ml lycopene exhibited 40 % DPPH scavenging activity and 50 % ABTS scavenging activity, whereas another polymeric film (E1-Ch/ LA-CS) containing 15.7 mg/ml lycopene exhibited 27 % DPPH scavenging activity and 48 % ABTS scavenging activity. Hence, the shelf life of the fruits was observed to be increased by 15 days, due to the higher scavenging rate of free radicals by E2-Ch/ LA-CS polymeric film (Yu et al., 2024 ). Moreover, 162.2 mg /g dry residue protein was obtained from sardine processing waste streams through DES consisting of betaine: propylene glycol (1:3) at 80 °C/ 18 h, exhibiting an enhanced peroxyl radical scavenging potential (2800 μmol Trolox equivalents /l) due to the aldehyde adduction and metal chelation activity of the peptides (Rodrigues et al., 2021 ). One promising approach lies in the antimicrobial applications of bioactives extracted from food waste using DES. However, evaluating their efficacy requires determining both the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC). MIC signifies the lowest concentration at which visible bacterial growth is inhibited, while MBC represents the concentration required for a 99.9 % reduction in viable bacterial counts. Bioactives perform antimicrobial activity through various means, including disrupting cell walls through hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions, chelating essential metal ions, or altering the permeability or pH of the bacterial cell (Lou & Chen, 2023 ; Pusty et al., 2024 ). In a recent study, a positive pattern in the inhibition zone was observed, with an increasing concentration of brewery spent grain hydrolysates (BSGH) ranging from 25 to 100 mg/mL against Salmonella enterica  and Escherichia coli . BSGF also contained protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, catechin, ferulic acid, and naringin, which effectively contributed to the antimicrobial activity (Fig. 3  ) (Roy et al., 2024 ). In another research study while extracting bioactive protein, as already discussed earlier, (Rodrigues et al., 2021 ) observed MBC values ranging from 500 to over 500 μl/ml and MIC values ranging from 250 to 500 μl/ml for Staphylococcus aureus  and Escherichia coli.  However, the water extract did not exhibit the capacity to inhibit the visible growth of both E. coli  and S. aureus  (MIC >500 μl/ml). Furthermore, (Gaharwar et al., 2023 ) observed the highest antibacterial activity of apple pomace extract with choline chloride and glycerol (1:3 mol/mol) against Staphylococcus aureus  and Listeria monocytogenesis,  with inhibition zones of 12.2 mm and 14.9 mm, respectively. This observation is attributed to its high content of polyphenols, namely rutin, phlorizin, syringic acid, chlorogenic acid, para-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, epicatechin, and catechin. Overall, the synergistic integration of DES-mediated bioactive extraction with their subsequent exploitation in food applications presents a compelling approach for both food waste management and food safety concerns. Thus, these bioactive compounds hold the potential to significantly align with the growing demand for sustainable solutions within the food industry.  3.2 Flavour compounds The food and beverage industry heavily relies on flavoring agents to enhance product appeal (Singh et al., 2024 ). However, traditional methods often involve synthetic ingredients or resource-intensive extraction processes. DES-assisted bioactive compounds encompass a wide range of naturally occurring flavours and aroma compounds. DES with high polarity effectively extracts water-soluble flavour precursors like anthocyanin from fruit peels. Conversely, DES with less polarity specifically extracts essential oils rich in esters and terpenes, commonly found in the citrus rinds which is a major fruit processing by-product (Molnar et al., 2024 ). With controlled optimization of extraction parameters, various desired flavour compounds can be obtained. In a recent work, a DES comprising choline chloride and glycerol (1:2 mol/mol) was utilized for the extraction of 72.78 mg GAE/g dry mass polyphenols from peppermint (Mentha piperita  L.) at 70 °C for 180 min. Moreover, the chromatographic analysis of the optimally produced extract indicated that the polyphenolic profile was primarily characterized by the presence of eriocitrin (36.60 mg g−1  dm), with significant amounts of luteolin 7-O-rutinoside (8.67 mg g−1  dm), luteolin 7-O-glucuronide (5.07 mg g−1  dm) and rosmarinic acid (5.08 mg g−1  dm) also detected (Fig. 4  ) (Athanasiadis et al., 2023 ). Whereas, in another study, 2.092 g/100 g dry mass of naringin was obtained from grapefruit peel using a DES consisting of ethanol and water (50 % v /v) assisted with high-voltage electric discharges at 218 kJ/kg, which can be further utilized for citrus-flavoured beverages. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis demonstrated that the use of aqueous glycerol and lactic acid: glucose enhanced the extraction of naringin by a factor of three compared to water, with their effectiveness being approximately equivalent to that of ethanol (El Kantar et al., 2019 ). Moreover, 0.25 μg/g fresh weight pelargonidin-3-glucoside, 27.94 μg/g fresh weight quercetin-3-glucoside, 47.69 μg/g fresh weight ellagic acid was extracted from strawberry waste through a DES-based on betaine and levulinic acid (1:2). Whereas 21.21 μg/g fresh weight pelargonidin-3-glucoside, 8.88 μg/g fresh weight quercetin-3-glucoside, 128.89 μg/g fresh weight ellagic acid through DES comprising choline chloride, glycolic acid and oxalic acid with a molar ratio of 1:1.7:0.3 (Vázquez-González et al., 2020 ). The obtained phenolics can be further utilized as a flavoring agent in formulating various food and beverage products. Overall, exploring the potential of bioactives from food waste presents a sustainable and functional alternative for flavoring applications. Utilizing food waste as a source of flavoring agents contributes to a more sustainable food production cycle and reduces the environmental impact of the food and beverage industry. Despite their promising potential, the utilization of bioactives in the food flavoring industry remains largely unexplored.  3.3 Nutraceuticals and functional ingredients In addition to serving as a sustainable alternative for the extraction of bioactive compounds, DES/NADES presents an opportunity for the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals utilizing all-natural colorants and preservatives (Hurkul et al., 2024 ). Bioactive compounds, recognized for their health-related benefits, are further known to reduce the risk of developing various diseases, including cancer, cataracts, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease among others (Direito et al., 2024 ; Yu et al., 2024 ). These beneficial effects are primarily attributed to its antioxidant and radical scavenging activities, which prolong or inhibit the oxidation of DNA, lipids, and protein by donating electrons without undergoing destabilization (Wu et al., 2024 ). Consequently, this process reduces oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants, which is implicated in chronic diseases and aging. Moreover, bioactive compounds prevent DNA from oxidative damage that can induce mutations and carcinogenesis, preventing cell membrane lipids from peroxidation, and avoiding oxidative modifications of proteins, thereby preserving their functionality (Muscolo et al., 2024 ; Mustafa, 2024 ). These antioxidants further enhance cellular defence mechanisms by upregulating endogenous antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase superoxide, dismutase, and catalase, thereby enhancing the body's natural defence system. Additionally, they modulate cell signalling pathways that regulate inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular repair processes; for instance, they activate the Nrf2 pathway, which governs the expression of antioxidant proteins (Hong et al., 2024 ; Pant et al., 2024 ). Through these comprehensive mechanisms, bioactive compounds effectively mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation, thereby reducing the risk of various associated diseases. In a recent study, collagen was extracted from codfish skin at a concentration of 2.2 % using DES composed of urea and propanoic acid in a 1:2 mol/mol ratio. This collagen exhibited antihypertensive properties with a 39.3 % ACE inhibition. Additionally, a chitosan capsule containing collagen hydrolysate demonstrated promising potential as a sustainable source of health products, with 58 % of its content being released in the intestine (Fig. 5 A ) (Silva et al., 2024 ). In another recent study, 13.3 g of protein were recovered from pomegranate seeds through valorization using choline chloride and acetic acid-based DESs in a 1:2 mol/mol ratio, where high-intensity focused ultrasound probe at 30 % amplitude for 5 min facilitated the process. Subsequently, 54 % of the proteins were hydrolyzed with pancreatin and pepsin, leading to the release of antioxidant peptides (Guzmán-Lorite et al., 2022 ). Notably, in another research work, anthocyanin was obtained using DES consisting of choline chloride and propylene glycol in a 1:2 mol/mol ratio, in combination with pressurized liquid extraction from Brazilian berry by-products. The extracted anthocyanin exhibited inhibitory activity against α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and lipase, with values of 6.36 mg/ml, 5.34 mg/ml, and 171.88 mg/ml, respectively, highlighting the considerable potential of this natural bioactive colorant for applications in nutraceuticals, food, and pharmaceutical formulations (Benvenutti et al., 2022 ). In conclusion, the utilization of DES in extracting bioactive from food waste offers a sustainable pathway for enhancing the functionality of nutraceuticals and functional ingredients. The diverse range of bioactive compounds obtained exhibits their potential to promote digestive health and address specific enzymatic processes. Despite its potential, limited studies have been conducted on the application of extracts from food waste materials as nutraceuticals and functional foods, thus further studies are required.  3.4 Food additives and preservatives DESs and NADESs extracted with bioactives hold immense potential as natural alternatives to synthetic food additives and preservatives (Sportiello et al., 2023 ). They function as scavengers, neutralizing free radicals that contribute to fat oxidation and protein degradation. This not only extends shelf life but also preserves the sensory qualities of food for longer. Additionally, bioactives possess antimicrobial activity, hindering the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other spoilage-causing microorganisms. These bioactives disrupt microbial cell membranes and interfere with their metabolism, preventing foodborne illness and ensuring the safety of food for consumption. Furthermore, certain bioactives can inhibit food spoilage enzymes, slowing down the breakdown of starches and fats, thereby preserving the texture and overall quality of food products (Bermúdez-Oria et al., 2023 ; Turan et al., 2024 ). In a recent research, 36.47 % pectin was extracted from grapefruit (Citrus paradisi ) peels with DES containing betaine and citric acid at 85 °C for 120 min. It was further utilized to formulate soybean oil-in-water-based emulsion, where 94.09 % emulsifying activity and 92.31 % emulsifying stability were observed with a 1.50 % pectin concentration, thus indicating its suitability in the food industry (Lin et al., 2024 ). In another study, 23.22 % tea saponins were extracted from Camellia oleifera  with a ternary DES composed of L-proline, glycerol, and sucrose at a 4:10:1 M ratio, aided by ultrasound treatment at 100 W for 30 min at 60 °C. The total antioxidant capacity of the tea saponin extract was estimated to be 30.24 %, thus indicating its potential application as a natural food additive (Tang et al., 2021 ). Moreover, broccoli leaves phenolics extracted through NADES composed of choline chloride and 1,2-propylene glycol (1:2 mol/mol) exhibited 50 % higher antioxidant activity than ethanol-based NADES, further indicating its potential as a natural food additive (Table 2 ) (Cao et al., 2023 ). Overall, the utilization of natural extracts, including those derived from various food waste sources, demonstrates their potential as functional ingredients in the food industry. These bioactive compounds offer promising opportunities for enhancing food products with their beneficial properties, contributing to the development of natural food additives and preservatives.   4 Regulatory considerations and safety aspects 4.1 Regulatory framework for DES in the food industry The utilization of DESs in the food industry is primarily governed by regulations set forth by different regulatory bodies. Assuring the compliance and safety of these green solvents. DES facilitates the extraction of bioactive moieties through the dissolution of complex food matrices. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regulates DES under the European Union's framework, assessing their safety for use in food applications (Fraguela-Meissimilly et al., 2023 ). Notably, this evaluation includes assessing factors such as potential residues, toxicity, and migration levels into food products. Likewise, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States evaluates the safety of DES, particularly in terms of their direct food contact, which is based on criteria such as their potential health risks, intended use, and chemical composition (Marchel et al., 2022 ). Additionally, international organizations like the Codex Alimentarius Commission establish standards and guidelines for food additives, including DES, to ensure global harmonization of safety standards (Ferreira et al., 2023 ). These regulatory frameworks aim to safeguard public health by ensuring that DES used in the food industry meets stringent safety criteria and does not pose risks to consumers. In conclusion, the regulatory framework for DES in the food industry focuses on ensuring the safety of the final product. By carefully selecting food-grade components for DES design, thoroughly characterizing the solvent, and potentially conducting additional safety assessments for novel bioactive, food manufacturers can navigate the evolving regulations and leverage the potential of DES for sustainable flavoring applications.  4.2 Safety and toxicological aspects Safety and toxicological assessments of DES in the food sector are crucial considerations, playing an important role in assuring the safe utilization of DES in food-related applications (Sharma & Lee, 2024 ). Such assessments necessitate a thorough analysis of their potential impacts and risks on human health and the environment, highlighting the importance of thorough regulatory oversight and adherence to safety standards. One of the key aspects of these assessments involves determining the lethal concentration (LC50 ) and inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) of DES, often through standardized assays termed the MTT assay, which evaluates cellular viability. LC50  values indicate the concentration at which a DES is lethal to 50 % of the tested organisms, typically assessed using animal models. On the other hand, IC50  values indicate the concentration at which a DES inhibits a specific biological function, such as cell proliferation or enzyme activity, by 50 % (Garralaga et al., 2022 ) (Khorsandi et al., 2021 ). In a recent study, the LC50 of DES tetrabutylammonium bromide (Tabb) and formic acid (FA), and Tabb and butyric acid (BA), was estimated to be 74 mg/l and 34 mg/l, respectively, against Cyprinus carpio  fish. Furthermore, the IC50 values for TBABr: FA and TBABr: BA were estimated to be 0.001073 μg/ml and 0.000911 μg/ml. Notably, the toxicity was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonding in DES synthesis (Fig. 5 B) (Inayat et al., 2023 ). In another research work, the ecotoxicity of DES samples was assessed using Zebrafish over 12 days. The hydrogen bond donor (HBD) in these solvents was p-toluene sulfonic acid monohydrate, while the salts varied among methyl triphenyl-phosphonium bromide, allyl triphenyl phosphonium bromide, choline chloride (ChCl), and N, N-diethyl ethanol ammonium chloride, with the molar ratio of salt to HBD maintained at 3:1. The LC50 values for DES-1, DES-2, DES-3, and DES-4 were determined to be 1 mg/l, 8.04 mg/l, 8.16 mg/l, and 7.94 mg/l, respectively. According to the rating scheme followed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Services, these values indicate moderate toxicity levels. This moderate toxicity was further supported by the absence of mortality observed in most cases during the 96-h limit test. Additionally, a significant correlation was noted between the increased concentrations of these DESs and an increase in the number of dead fish (Hayyan et al., 2024 ). Moreover, IC50  values for various DESs based on choline chloride as the HBA and ethylene glycol, glycerol, and urea as HBD were estimated to be 32.9 μg/ml, 36.6 μg/ml, and 36.2 μg/ml, respectively, against the melanoma skin cell line (B16F10), thus indicating minimal toxicity (Khorsandi et al., 2021 ). In conclusion, safety assessments play a vital role in ensuring DES suitability for food applications. LC50  and IC50  values provide crucial data on toxicity levels. Studies show varying toxicity depending on DES composition, with some exhibiting minimal impact on fish and even human melanoma cells. These findings highlight the need for continued research and careful selection of DES components to ensure their safe and sustainable implementation within the food sector. Further research studies are essential to ensure their safe use and minimize risks to human health and the environment.  4.3 Consumer perception and acceptance Consumer perception and acceptance of DES in the context of green chemistry have evolved with the primary aim of reducing the synthesis and utilization of hazardous substances (González-Campos et al., 2024 ). DESs, recognized as green solvents due to the aforementioned reasons, have gained attention as promising alternatives in the food sector. However, their extensive applications necessitate rigorous safety evaluations before widespread adoption, especially within food-related applications (González-Campos et al., 2024 ). The toxicity studies on DES indicate its lower cytotoxic values than their constituents, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive safety assessments (Sharma & Lee, 2024 ). Factors influencing DES toxicity include cell types, viscosity, synergistic effects among components, molar ratios, presence of organic acids, and pH levels. Additionally, the potential adverse effects of DES by-products, such as those containing urea, signify the need for risk assessment posed by ammonia toxicity. Consequently, thorough research into the effects of DES on living organisms is imperative, particularly concerning the safety of biomacromolecules extracted using DES (González-Campos et al., 2024 ). Consumer perception and acceptance of DES hinge on understanding these safety considerations and the broader implications for human health and the environment. While DESs offer promising benefits in terms of sustainability and reduced environmental impact, consumers further prioritize the safety and integrity of food products (Sharma & Lee, 2024 ). Thus, transparent information regarding safety assessments and regulatory assessment is essential to enhance the usage of DES in food-related applications. By addressing these concerns and promoting awareness of the potential benefits and safety assurances, consumer acceptance of DES can be improved, paving the way for their responsible integration into the food industry as green solvents.   5 Conclusion and future perspectives DESs have emerged as an effective solution for valorizing food waste by efficiently extracting various bioactive compounds, thus gaining considerable attention due to their efficiency and eco-friendliness. Moreover, DESs demonstrate versatility in various extraction techniques, highlighting their ability to enhance the extraction efficiency and recovery of bioactive compounds. Consequently, future research should focus on improving the yield and purity of extracted using DESs by optimizing extraction conditions and gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, assessing the safety and stability of extracted bioactive compounds is essential to ensure their suitability for use in the food industry. Notably, the toxicological aspects of DES formulations and their impact on human health and the environment require further research. Ultimately, DESs hold considerable potential to revolutionize extraction processes in the food processing sector, offering a more sustainable and effective approach to obtaining valuable natural compounds.
