                  Improving China's total environmental quality is an important means to implement the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. How to quantify the environmental quality evolution progress scientifically, and ensure realizing the goals of fresh air, clean water, soil safety, good ecology, and fine human settlement environment in China is an urgent and significant issue. Here, according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and China's development characteristics, we construct an integrated environmental quality evaluation index system, comprising 5 dimensions—air environmental quality, water environmental quality, soil environmental quality, ecological environmental quality, and human settlement environmental quality—to measure the progress in achieving the SDGs over the past 20 years. Findings show China has made substantial improvements in environmental quality, with an average growth rate of 2.4% annually, presenting high in southeast and low in northwest. Human settlement environmental quality improved to the largest extent, 6.5% annually, followed by ecological, water, soil, and air environmental quality, with an annual rate of 2.46, 2.45,1.83, and 0.84%, respectively. All regions present an increasing trend in total environment. However, large gaps still existed between diverse regions across China. Furthermore, coordination development level between environment and economy rose constantly across China, and 23 provinces have reached the primary coordination development status. Targeted practical measures are proposed to promote environmental quality improvement. It will provide a policy-related assessment tool to help develop sound development strategies and balance national and local capacities for sustainable development.

How to quantify the environmental quality evolution progress scientifically, and ensure realizing the goals of fresh air, clean water, soil safety, good ecology, and fine human settlement environment in China is an urgent and significant issue. Here, according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and China's development characteristics, we construct an integrated environmental quality evaluation index system, comprising 5 dimensions—air environmental quality, water environmental quality, soil environmental quality, ecological environmental quality, and human settlement environmental quality—to measure the progress in achieving the SDGs over the past 20 years. Findings show China has made substantial improvements in environmental quality, with an average growth rate of 2.4% annually, presenting high in southeast and low in northwest. Human settlement environmental quality improved to the largest extent, 6.5% annually, followed by ecological, water, soil, and air environmental quality, with an annual rate of 2.46, 2.45,1.83, and 0.84%, respectively. All regions present an increasing trend in total environment. However, large gaps still existed between diverse regions across China. Furthermore, coordination development level between environment and economy rose constantly across China, and 23 provinces have reached the primary coordination development status. Targeted practical measures are proposed to promote environmental quality improvement. It will provide a policy-related assessment tool to help develop sound development strategies and balance national and local capacities for sustainable development.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Total environmental quality  SDGs  Spatiotemporal evolution  Cross-regional joint governance  Coordinated development  China   Data availability All data/data sources needed to evaluate the conclusions of this study are present in the paper   1 Introduction The 17 Sustainable Development Goals were unanimously adopted by the 193 United Nations member states in 2015 as a call to action to eradicate poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives and futures of all people. The sustainability of resources and environment is fundamental to achieving sustainable development goals because economic and social development cannot exceed the carrying capacity of nature (Fang and Heijungs, 2015 ; Khan et al., 2022 ). Improving China's total environment is an important means to progress toward the United Nations SDGs. China has integrated the improvement of overall environmental quality into all aspects of economic and social development. In 2012, China proposed to integrate ecological civilization construction in the whole process and all aspects of economic, political, cultural, and social construction. Over the past 20 years, China has made great changes in environmental protection, laying a solid foundation for fundamentally improving China's environmental situation and realizing the SDGs. While striving to improve its environmental situation, China, as an active stakeholder, is firmly committed to international cooperation and the Paris Climate Agreement to contribute to global environmental governance. How to measure China's practical progress in promoting SDGs scientifically requires an objective assessment of the improvement of overall environmental quality in China. However, how to quantify the improvement process and extent of environmental quality in China is complex, urgent but unclear. It helps to know the environmental quality in different periods and regions, identify the current problems and potential risks, and guide different regions in China to accelerate the improvement of environmental quality to ensure clean air, clean water, safe soil, good ecology, and sound living conditions. We built a comprehensive environmental quality evaluation index system and established a scientific method to evaluate the current situation of China's environmental quality improvement, which can provide a basis for realizing the sustainable development goals of effective protection of the ecological environment, sustainable utilization of natural resources, green economic and social development, and harmonious coexistence between man and nature. Environmental quality is an umbrella term that can refer to a variety of characteristics associated with the natural and built environment; it is a measure of environmental conditions relative to one or more species and/or any human need or purpose (Sinha et al., 2020 ). Total environmental quality has a fairly broad connotation (Rehdanz and Maddison, 2008 ), including air environmental quality, water environmental quality, soil environmental quality, ecological environment quality, and human settlement environmental quality. Here, to describe a total environment system, pressure, response and status should be used to reflect all its aspects comprehensively, because these embody the interaction between human beings and the environment. In this study, section 1  introduces the significance and innovation of our work, section 2  conducts a literature review, section 3  constructs the research framework and explains the source of the data employed, the results were presented in section 4 , related discussion and policy implications were given in section 5 , and the last section summarizes the conclusions.  2 Literature review Existing research has evaluated the air environmental quality of different cities involving multiple spatial and temporal scales. Uneven urbanization level is the main reason for regional differences in air pollutant concentrations (Du et al., 2018 ; Fang and Liu, 2009 ). In areas with rapid urbanization and dense population, such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta, air pollution is significantly worse than that in areas with low urbanization level (Luo et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). PM10  is the primary pollutant in atmosphere in Chongqing, followed by NOX  and SO2 , and meteorological factors such as temperature, sunshine and precipitation have a certain correlation with the seasonal changes of atmospheric environmental quality (Wang et al., 2018 ). Multivariate data analysis methods and air quality transport models were combined to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution of O3  and NO2  concentrations in Catalonia, Spain (Platikanov et al., 2022 ). Xiao et al. (2019a)  adopted the grey correlation method to evaluate the atmospheric environment quality of Xinxiang City, and found that the problem of suspended particulate matter in winter is particularly prominent in Xinxiang. The atmospheric environmental quality of Diebu County, Gansu Province, from 2013 to 2017 is greatly affected by PM10 , and less affected by SO2  and NO2  which was testified by a research (Xu, 2021 ) using AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) approach. Cloud model was applied to evaluate Changsha's air environmental quality from 2014 to 2016 (Zhao et al., 2017 ), and results show that the cloud model can well achieve the uncertainty mapping between the evaluation index values and the atmospheric environmental quality levels, and the evaluation results are consistent with the actual situation. Many studies use indicators such as per capita wastewater discharge, per capita chemical oxygen demand discharge, and per capita ammonia nitrogen discharge to measure the water environmental quality based on water footprint model and grey correlation method (Feng et al., 2017 ; Johnson and Mehrvar, 2019 ; Li et al., 2009 ). In addition, the research on water environment includes the factors that affect water pollution and the efficiency of water environmental pollution control. Numerous studies survied the impact of opening-up level, economic development, industrial agglomeration, technological innovation, and regulatory system on water pollution (Fan and Fang, 2020 ; Ighalo et al., 2021 ; Kasavan et al., 2021 ; Kılkış et al., 2019 ). It is found that climate change and social economy posed further challenges to water environmental quality (Arnell et al., 2015 ; Henriques et al., 2015 ). Some scholars estimated the industrial and urban water pollution treatment efficiency in China using the input-output and DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) model and found the treatment efficiency is not high (An et al., 2019 ; Wang and Xie, 2014 ). DPSR (Driving forces-Pressure-State-Responses) method was used to establish comprehensive evaluation index system to evaluate the water ecological environmental health of lake Basin (Wu et al., 2022 ). The government's high autonomy of environmental management is not conducive to the improvement of water environmental pollution treatment efficiency (Pan and Lu, 2019 ). With the development of modern industrial and agricultural production, the massive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the discharge of industrial production wastewater and urban sewage and waste into the soil have been destroying the natural dynamic balance of the soil, degrading the quality of the soil and causing soil pollution (Mishra et al., 2016 ). On one hand, soil pollutants in crop systems directly affect the function and structure of farmland ecosystems, threatening the security of ecosystems (Chen et al., 2010, 2016 ); on the other hand, these pollutants enter human body through food chain by crops as an intermediate medium, causing various diseases and endangering human health (Huang et al., 2019 ). The observation of soil is increasing with the advance of industrialization and rapid economic growth (Kang et al., 2020 ). Heavery metals are importants pollutants to soil accompanied with fertilizer and pestisides use and other waste discharges (Li et al., 2020 ). While the target metals are obtained by physical and chemical methods, other heavy metals are also released, causing large amounts of heavy metals to enter the atmosphere, water, and soil, resulting in serious environmental pollution and harm to human health (Li, 2013 ; Li et al., 2020 ). Many studies have shown that human activities are the main source of soil pollution, and the more intensive human activities are, the more serious the pollution is (Hölzle et al., 2022 ). In the evaluation of soil pollution, the weight of each factor is mostly determined by experts according to the toxicity of pollutants, the absorption of pollutants by human body and the experience of the maximum threshold of human body's tolerance of pollutants, which is subjective and the evaluation results are often distorted. When determining the weight, the influence of pollutants on the environment and the harm degree to human body should be considered simultaneously, which could help to enhance the scientific value of the weight and improve the validity and accuracy of soil environmental quality evaluation. There are two main evaluation methods on ecological environment, one is the evaluation of the ecological environment state (Fuhrman, 1999 ), the other is the evaluation of the ecological environment service function (Buckley and Chauvenet, 2021 ). The former includes stability and vulnerability assessment, system health assessment, and ecological security assessment (Liu and Hao, 2017 ; Qiu et al., 2022 ). Most researchers select appropriate ecological indicators to evaluate the ecological environment quality and analyze the regional ecological environment state (Dimnwobi et al., 2021 ). Commonly used methods include AHP, fuzzy evaluation (Peng et al., 2017 ), VOR (Vigor-Organization-Resilience, VOR) model (Yan et al., 2016 ). Xiao et al. (2019b)  evaluated the regional ecological environment quality of Shanghai and Hangzhou Bay based on land use/land cover change and landscape ecology. With the development of satellite remote sensing (RS) technology, ecological environmental assessment studies based on RS data and technology have gradually emerged (Cheng et al., 2008 ; Lin et al., 2019 ; Xu, 2013 ), involving urban agglomeration (Cheng and He, 2019 ), watershed (Celestino et al., 2019 ), and provincial and municipal scales (Hu and Xu, 2018 ; Shan et al., 2019 ). Since the 1970s, foreign scholars have regarded rural human settlements as a part of urban human settlements, paying more attention to urban communities and urban fringe areas (Egidi et al., 2020 ; Kleemann et al., 2017 ). Most studies on human settlement environmental quality have been conducted at the micro-scale of individual villages (Mpofu et al., 2018 ) or residential area (Mathee et al., 2021 ), and on transportation accessibility (Květoň et al., 2017 ) and community health status (Harris et al., 2017 ). Li et al. (2014)  constructed a comprehensive evaluation system of urban human settlement environment quality to survey 5 cities of Ningxia Province with AHP and entropy weight method. Study on human settlements is becoming more and more complete, expanding from the urban scale to the regional and rural scale. Domestic research on human settlement still has a tendency toward “urbanism”, and scholars have carried out extensive research based on different disciplinary perspectives and different temporal and spatial scales (Yang and Wang, 2013 ); the research methods are gradually diversified, mainly including principal component analysis, hierarchical analysis, and GIS technology (Skalicky and Čerpes, 2019 ; Yang et al., 2020 ; Zhou et al., 2011 ). The assessment of comprehensive environmental quality is a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the overall environmental quality of a region according to a certain purpose. At present, there is no unified index that can comprehensively and scientifically represent the overall quality level of the environment. Scholars have carried out related research for different areas and used different methods. For example, Joseph et al. (2014)  selected a series of factors related to physical environment and built environment, and natural disaster factors to evaluate the urban environmental quality of Port-au-Prince. Using the monitoring data of air, water, soil and plants in Zhuzhou City, Wang (2002)  uses the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate Zhuzhou City's overall environmental quality. Vatalis and Kaliampakos (2006)  proposed an Environmental Quality Index to evaluate overall environmental quality in coal-mining areas of Greece. Also, the eco-environment of a coal mine of Shendong Group of Chian was evaluated based on the cloud model theory (Huang et al., 2022b ). Li and Li (2016)  found that the environmental quality presents an uneven regional distribution through a comprehensive assessment. Central China has the worst environmental quality, and the western China has the best. Liu and Yuan (2015)  studied the environmental quality at the inter-provincial scale in China by constructing China's environmental self-purification capability index and environmental pollution emission index. Longhini et al. (2022)  assessed environmental quality of the continental shelf under three seasonal scenarios—2018/2019-wet, 2019-dry, and 2019/2020-wet using chemical multi-indicator and physical methods. Such evaluation work is usually carried out based on various single-factor assessments (Davids et al., 2022 ). The evaluation methodology has undergone an evolution from a single-factor indicator approach to a multi-factor integrated indicator approach. The single-factor indicator method is based on environmental quality standards, has clear objectives and is comparable. In contrast, the single-factor index method can only evaluate one element of the environment and cannot reflect the comprehensive status of environmental quality. The composite index method compensates for this shortcoming and has been used in many research efforts in recent years. In summary, environmental quality was typically analyzed from the perspective of a single factor, even though we know that humans are exposed to these multiple environmental domains simultaneously, it is rare to combine multiple environmental domains, while there are very few studies on systematically analyzing and evaluating China's total environmental quality from the perspective of multi-factor integration. There are many analyses and evaluations of environmental quality from typical cities or local areas, but few at the national level. Many analyses of total environmental quality are conducted on short time scales, but few on long time scales. To fill the gap, our study constructs a multi-factor integrated comprehensive evaluation model to evaluate China's total environmental quality at the national and regional level, using continuous data from 2000 to 2019. Since the air, water, soil, ecology and human settlements around us all play a part in human wellbeing, our research attempts to cover all aspects of the total environment in the broadest sense, and we reveal the panorama of China's total environment change to reflect the progress towards SDGs. This paper could provide a scientific basis and practical guidance for exploring the implementation path of environmental governance, improving environmental quality, and realizing green development, which can advance the SDGs and play a role model for other developing countries' practices.  3 Methods and data 3.1 Index system and grading standard China has constantly kept high economic growth during the last decades, and its economy was more concentrated in manufacturing and relatively less in the service sector. Based on resource-intensive manufacturing, low-paid labor and exports, China has achieved high growth, and also led to environmental emissions augment, and economic, social and environmental imbalances. Reducing imbalances between economy and environment requires a transition in the economic structure from manufacturing to high-value services. Environmental problems in the world cannot be resolved without China's participation. China's increasing economy is also a significant basis of global requirement. Focusing on key indicators of SDGs, and taking into full consideration the characteristics of China's development and industrial structure, we construct a scientific and reasonable indicator system for assessing the total environmental quality. We first selected specific SDGs that are directly related to the environment, then searched for corresponding indicators based on their meanings, and supplemented those characteristic indicators that are not directly mentioned by the SDGs but reflect China's environmental quality (Fig. 1  ). The assessment system comprises 19 third-level indicators in 5 categories of second-level indicators: air environmental quality (Corresponding to SDG 3.9 and 11.6), water environmental quality (Corresponding to SDG 3.9, 6.3 and 6.6), soil environmental quality (Corresponding to SDG 2.4 and 3.9), ecological environmental quality (Corresponding to SDG 6.6, SDG15.1–15.5) and human settlement environmental quality (Corresponding to SDG 6.b, 7.2, and 11.6; See supplementary materials for specific meanings of SDGs). The weights of the third-level indicators are identified using the AHP model supported by entropy method (see supplementary materials), and the weights of the second-level indicators are got by summing up the weights of corresponding third-level indicators. According to the actual possible value range of specific indicators, we determine the upper and lower limits of each indicator by referring to relevant national standards, planning objectives, national action plans, and advanced domestic and foreign levels; Each specific indicator is normalized and divided into 5 levels. The specific classifications of the third-level indicators are shown in Table 1  .  3.2 Data collection Our selected indicators should be scientifically sound, broadly accepted, and based on affordable monitoring or statistics. Air environmental quality index, containing fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) concentration, inhalable particulate matter (PM10 ) concentration, and proportion of days with good air quality in cities at prefecture level and above, was obtained from monitoring data from 2000 to 2019 provided by Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.1  1 The data is internal and not publicly available.   Water environmental quality indicator, including the proportion of surface water with excellent quality, the proportion of surface water inferior to class Ⅴ, the water quality compliance rate of centralized drinking water sources in cities at prefectural level and above, are sourced from China environmental bulletin (See supplementary materials for data sources), environmental Status Bulletin of various regions, and the data collected by local governments (See supplementary materials for data sources). Four indexes were selected to evaluate the soil environmental quality: Safe utilization of polluted cultivated land, fertilizer utilization rate, fertilizer application intensity and pesticide application intensity. Among them, the safe utilization rate of polluted cultivated land was derived from the detailed survey results of soil pollution status nationwide. The data of fertilizer utilization rate was obtained from Chinese Academy of Sciences.2  2 Xin Liangjie. Spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of Chemical fertilizer utilization rate of Grain crops in China from 1998 to 2018. Internal Information.   Fertilizer application intensity and pesticide application intensity were obtained from China Rural Statistical Yearbook (See supplementary materials for data sources). Forest coverage rate and wetland coverage rate come from China Statistical Yearbook (See supplementary materials for data sources), China Environmental Statistical Yearbook (See supplementary materials for data sources) and China Forestry Statistical Yearbook (See supplementary materials for data sources). Soil and water conservation rate was provided by the Ministry of Water Resources,3  3 The data is internal and not publicly available.   and the proportion of nature reserve area to land area is from China Statistical Yearbook, China Rural Statistical Yearbook and China Tertiary Industry Statistical Yearbook (See supplementary materials for data sources). The data of urban sewage treatment rate from 2000 to 2018 are from China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook (See supplementary materials for data sources), and the data of 2019 are from the data collected from provinces. Harmless disposal rate of municipal solid waste came from China Statistical Yearbook. Green coverage rate of built-up area was obtained from China Urban Statistical Yearbook and China Statistical Yearbook. Data on coverage of sanitary toilets in rural areas was obtained from China Health Statistics Yearbook (See supplementary materials for data sources) and China Rural Statistics Yearbook. The rural biomass fuel use per capita in rural areas was collected from Shu Tao of Peking University (Yun et al., 2020 ). The above indicators are not only considered to correspond with SDGs to the maximum extent, but also required to be scientific, reasonable and operable.  3.3 Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model and coordination analysis Fuzzy membership model was used to evaluate environmental quality comprehensively because each index is divided into different grades. Fuzzy membership degree model is based on fuzzy mathematics theory, which standardizes the attribute values of each evaluation object according to the membership degree relationship of evaluation factors and objects (Wu and Zhang, 2021 ). China's total environmental quality assessment adopts the subject-level method, standardizes the indicators of the total environmental quality assessment index system according to the grading target value, and divides the standardized indicators into 5 levels: 0 ≤x’ <20 is poor (grade I), 20 ≤ x’ < 40 is fair (grade II), 40 ≤ x’ <60 is general (grade III), 60 ≤ x’ < 80 is good (grade IV), and 80 ≤x’  ≤100 is excellent (grade V). The original indicator's threshold u n    , after standardizing by fuzzy membership model, becomes v n    . Obviously, v 1     = 0, …, and v 6     = 100. Consequently, the total environmental quality index was classified into 5 levels (Table 2  ). The standardization formula is as follows: Positive indicators:(1) x k i j  ′  = { v 1  , x k i j   < u 1     v n + 1   − v n   u n + 1   − u n    ( x k i j   − u n   )  + v n  , u n  ≤ x k i j   ≤ u n + 1   ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 5  )     v 6  , x k i j   > u 6            Negative indicators:(2) x k i j  ′  = { v 1  ,   x k i j   > u 1                v n + 1   − v n   u n  − u n + 1     × ( u n  − x k i j    )  + v n  ,   u n + 1   ≤ x k i j   ≤ u n  ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 5  )        v 6  ,   x k i j   < u 6              Where, x k i j      is the raw data of indicator j  in region i  in the kth  year, x k i j  ′     is the standardized data, u n     of the specific indicators were shown in Table 1 . Based on the normalization and grading of original indicators and the determination of the weight of each indicator, the specific indicators in the 5 s-level indicators are weighted and summed. The corresponding air environmental quality index I B1  , water environmental quality index I B2  , soil environmental quality index I B3  , eco-environmental quality index I B4  , human settlement environmental quality index I B5  , and the total environmental quality index I A   were calculated by weighted integration:(3) I B 1   = ω C 1   x C 1  ′  + ω C 2   x C 2  ′  + ω  C 3   x C 3  ′      (4) I B 2   = ω C 4   x C 4  ′  + ω C 5   x C 5  ′  + ω  C 6   x C 6  ′      (5) I B 3   = ω C 7   x C 7  ′  + ω C 8   x C 8  ′  + ω  C 9   x C 9  ′  + ω  C 10   x C 10  ′      (6) I B 4   = ω C 11   x C 11  ′  + ω C 12   x C 12  ′  + ω  C 12   x C 13  ′  + ω  C 14   x C 14  ′      (7) I B 5   = ω C 15   x C 15  ′  + ω C 16   x C 16  ′  + ω  C 17   x C 17  ′  + ω  C 18   x C 18  ′  + ω  C 19   x C 19  ′      (8) I A  = ω B 1   I B 1   + ω B 2   I B 2   + ω B 3   I B 3   + ω B 4   I B 4   + ω  B 5   I B 5       Where, ω C 1     , ω C 2     , ω C 3     , …, ω C 19      represent the weights of 19 indicators, respectively. x C 1  ′  , x C 2  ′  , x C 3  ′  , …  x C 19  ′     represent the normalized values of 19 indicators, respectively. ω B 1   , ω B 2   , ω B 3   , ω B 4   , ω B 5      denote the weights of the second-level indicators. To further correspond to sustainable development intrinsically, we investigate the coordination development status between economic growth and environmental quality. Total environmental quality is used to denote the environment subsystem(P 1  ), and constant GDP is adopted to represent the economy subsystem(P 2  ). We can get the coupling coordination degree as follows (Fan et al., 2019 ), after standardizing and weighting these two kinds of original indicators (see supplementary materials).(9) C = [ ∏ i = 1  n  P i  ∕ ( 1 n  ∑ i n  P i    )  n    ]  1 n       (10) T = α P 1  + β P 2      (11) D = ( C × T  )  1 / 2       where C  denotes the coupling degree, D  is coupling coordination degree, and T  represents the comprehensive evaluation index of the whole system which is used to measure the contribution to the overall development level. Environmental quality and economic development are of considerable importance, so α  = β  = 0.5 is employed in this study.   4 Results 4.1 Air environmental quality For decades, China has done a lot of work on air pollution control and air quality management and achieved remarkable results. From 2000 to 2013, the changes of PM2.5  and PM10  concentrations in China were consistent, and both showed a fluctuating upward trend. In 2011, the concentration peaked, reaching 81 μg/m3  and 122 μg/m3 , respectively. Since 2013, with implementing the campaign to protect the blue sky, efforts have been intensified to control air pollution, and air quality has improved significantly. PM2.5  and PM10  concentrations have decreased much, and the proportion of days with good air quality has increased significantly, which greatly promoted the implementation of SDG11.6. By 2019, PM2.5  concentration has approached the second-level limit of the national standard, PM10  concentration has met the standard for two consecutive years, and the proportion of days with good air quality has reached 86%. Significant progress has been made in air pollution control in various regions. During 2000–2019, the provinces with the fastest reduction of PM2.5  concentration included Tibet, Hainan, Guizhou, Shanghai, Fujian, Qinghai, Chongqing, and Zhejiang, and the provinces with the fastest reduction of PM10  concentration included Tibet, Qinghai, Shanghai, Hainan, Gansu, Guizhou, Chongqing, and Beijing. The provinces with the fastest increase in the proportion of days with good air quality included Sichuan, Beijing, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Chongqing, and Inner Mongolia. From 2000 to 2019, the air environmental quality of each region showed a significant trend of improvement. The provinces with the largest net increment of air environmental quality index in the past 20 years were Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Jiangxi, Chongqing, Inner Mongolia, Shanghai, and Beijing. The provinces with the fastest growth rate of air environmental quality index are Sichuan, Jiangxi, Chongqing, Qinghai, Gansu, Shanghai, Beijing, and Inner Mongolia. By 2019, Tibet had the highest air environmental quality (96.96), followed by Qinghai (94.28), Yunnan (93.44), Guizhou (92.71), Hainan (92.57), and Fujian (92.27). These six provinces were the first to reach the excellent level in air environmental quality (Fig. 3 ). Henan (62.46) and Hebei (58.66) had the lowest levels, but are also in the general category. Industrial structure and energy structure are the main reasons for the difference in air environmental quality index. China's air environment quality fell first and then rose, showing an overall upward trend (Fig. 2   ). In 2000, China's air quality index was 65.96, which decreased to 55.91 in 2011. After 2012, it gradually rose to 77.39 in 2019, which experienced an evolution process from “good” to “general” and then back to “good”. It directly reduces the negative impact of air pollution, indicating a significant increase in SDG11.6. The average growth rate of the air quality index over the years was 0.84%, indicating that China's air environmental quality dropped to the lowest value around 2010. Since then, with implementing the blue sky protection campaign (Xinhuanet, 2017 ), the efforts of air pollution control have been continuously intensified (State Council, 2013 ), and air environmental quality improvement has been continuously expanded (Fig. 2 ), which has greatly facilitated the achievement of SDG 3.9 mainly involving reducing air pollution.  4.2 Water environment quality Indicators of water environmental quality continue to get better, meaning clear water protection has achieved remarkable results. The proportion of China's surface water with excellent quality continued to increase, from 30% in 2000 to 75% in 2019, with an average improvement rate of 1.40% annually. Provinces with the fastest growth include Shanxi, Liaoning, Tianjin, Hebei, Shaanxi, Jilin, and Jiangsu. The proportion of excellent surface water quality remained at the highest level of 100%(Tibet). The proportion of surface water inferior to Class V continued to decrease, from about 50% in 2000 to about 4% in 2019, with an average annual decrease rate of 12.4%. Water quality undergoes substantial improvement, promoting SDG 6.3 and 6.6. The proportion of surface water inferior to Class V decreased at an average annual rate of 10.5%, and the provinces with the fastest annual decrease rate included Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Guangxi, Hainan, and Sichuan. The water quality compliance rate of centralized drinking water sources of prefecture-level and above cities continued to improve, rising from 90% in 2000 to 92% in 2019, with an average annual improvement rate of 0.12%. Sichuan, Hunan, Henan, Xinjiang, Fujian, Chongqing, and Zhejiang saw the fastest improvement in water quality compliance rate. In 2000, the water quality of Northwest China and some coastal areas of South China was above good, while that of North China, Central China, and Southwest China was poor or fair. By 2010, the water environment quality of all regions had improved, only Shanxi and Yunnan had fair water environment quality, and the number of areas with good and excellent water environment quality had increased, among which Tibet, Gansu, Ningxia, Chongqing and Guangxi had excellent levels. With the promotion of water environment control and improvement in China, the water environment quality in all regions continues to improve. By 2019, the provinces with the highest water environment quality included Tibet, Guizhou, Fujian, Hainan, Sichuan, Qinghai and Guangxi, and the provinces with the lowest water environment quality included Shanxi, Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, etc. From 2000 to 2019, Henan, Sichuan, Liaoning, Yunnan, Hubei, Shanghai and Hebei experienced the fastest improvement in water environmental quality. The water environmental quality of China increased from 47.27 in 2000 to 52.50 in 2010, and again to 74.91 in 2019, with an average growth rate of 2.45%, indicating a great increment in SDG6.3. In 2000, there were 8 fair and 1 poor regions in China, while in 2019, they were all good or excellent in water environmental quality. The cleanliness of water bodies in northwest and south of China is better than that in central, east, and northeast of China (Fig. 3 ), indicating that the Action Plan for Water Pollution Prevention and Control (State Council, 2015 ) has achieved remarkable results (to promote the achievement of the SDG3.9 mainly including reducing water pollution).  4.3 Soil environmental quality The improvement of soil environmental quality is slow, and the clean land protection campaign still needs solid progress. The safe utilization rate of polluted cultivated land showed growth during 2000–2019 and reached 94.75% in 2019. Provinces including Guangxi, Gansu, Yunnan, Liaoning, Hebei, Shaanxi, Tibet, Hunan, and Qinghai have experienced rapid improvement in the safe use of polluted cultivated land. The annual growth rate of fertilizer utilization was 0.42%, and 25 provinces showed growth, with the fastest increasing rate in Fujian, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Xinjiang, Gansu, Chongqing, and Beijing. From 2014 to 2019, fertilizer application intensity decreased from 24.13kg/mu to 21.95kg/mu, and the growth rate decreased from 2.93% to −0.78%, effectively curbing the growth trend of fertilizer application. The provinces with the fastest decreasing annual growth rate included Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guizhou, Hubei, Sichuan, and Jiangxi. Pesticide application intensity also showed a significant downward trend, with the average growth rate of each region decreasing from 3.55% during 2000–2011 to −3.49% during 2012–2019. The use rate of pesticides gradually improved, with the fastest improvement in Shanghai, Hebei, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Sichuan and Xinjiang. Overall, the utilization rate of chemical fertilizer and pesticide in China is still low, which is far behind that of developed countries in Europe and the United States. The utilization rate of nitrogen fertilizer for grain crops in the United States is about 50%, and that of chemical fertilizer for grain crops in major European countries is about 65%, 12–27% higher than that in China (Xiong and Wu, 2017 ). The prevention and control of soil pollution and the safe utilization of soil in China still face great challenges. The soil environmental quality increased slowly. In 2000, the soil environmental quality was evenly distributed across China. Among which, Fujian had the lowest soil environmental quality level (fair), Heilongjiang, Chongqing, and Guizhou had the highest level (good), while the rest regions were general in soil environmental quality. The number of provinces with good soil environmental quality increased from 7 in 2015 to 19 in 2019, among which the soil environmental quality of Qinghai province was excellent (Fig. 4  ). In 2019, China's soil environmental quality index showed a spatial pattern of high in the northwest and low in the southeast. Provinces with rapid improvement in soil environmental quality from 2000 to 2019 included Shanghai, Qinghai, Liaoning, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Shanxi. From 2000 to 2019, soil environmental quality changed from general to good, showing an overall improvement trend (Fig. 4 ). This strongly supports SDG 2.4 which aims to improve soil quality. The soil environmental quality index increased from 49.92 in 2000 to 50.54 in 2010 and then to 70.44 in 2019, with an average growth rate of 1.83% annually, indicating that China's soil environmental quality is slowly improving, but the situation is not optimistic. From 2000 to 2019, the safe utilization rate of polluted farmland and the utilization rate of chemical fertilizer continued to increase, and the intensity of chemical fertilizer and pesticide application decreased (supporting SDG 3.9 which aims at reducing chemical and soil pollution), so the soil environmental quality improved, and soil pollution prevention and control achieved certain results. Since the promulgation and implementation of the Action Plan for Soil Pollution Prevention and Control in 2016, China's soil safety situation has improved, and the soil environmental quality index in 2018–2019 increased to good level. China's soil environmental quality was good in 2019, with Qinghai province being excellent.  4.4 Ecological environmental quality Eco-environmental quality indicators have been gradually improved, and systematic ecological protection and restoration of mountains, rivers, forests, farmland, lakes, and grasslands and afforestation efforts have achieved initial results. China's forest coverage rate increased steadily, from 16.55% in 2000 to 23% in 2019 by 38.97%. The provinces with the fastest growth rate included Qinghai, Ningxia, Jiangsu, Xinjiang, Tibet, Gansu, Shanghai, and Henan. China's wetland coverage increased from 4.01% in 2000 to 5.56% in 2019, with the fastest growth rates in Chongqing, Xinjiang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Fujian, Sichuan, Anhui and Hebei. China's soil and water conservation rate increased from 63.87% in 2000 to 71.66% in 2019, with the fastest growth rates in Ningxia, Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Hebei, and Hubei. The proportion of nature reserves in China's national land area increased from 9.90% in 2000 to 15.32% in 2019, with Shanxi, Zhejiang, Hebei, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Guangdong recording the fastest growth. This shows that China's systematic ecological protection, restoration and greening of mountains, rivers, forests, farmland, lakes, and grasslands have strengthened the national ecological security barrier and significantly improved the stability and quality of the ecosystem, all these measures have contributed to the achievement of SDG15.1–15.5 greatly. Before 2012, China's ecological environment was deteriorating overall and improving in some areas, with governance capacity far behind the speed of destruction and ecological deficit gradually expanding. The 18th Report of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012 incorporated ecological progress into the five-sphere integrated plan, significantly strengthening environmental protection and improving the quality of the ecological environment. All regions’ Ecological environmental quality has gradually improved, and remarkable progress has been made in ecological management. In 2000, about one-third of the regions were rated as fair, and about one-third of the regions were rated as general. Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Shanxi provinces were rated as poor, but Ningxia and Shanxi have experienced significant improvement in their ecological quality. Over time, the areas with poor and fair eco-environmental quality gradually decreased, while the areas with general and good eco-environmental quality increased significantly. In 2019, 18 regions were rated as good, and 10 regions were rated as general. Only Xinjiang and Shanxi provinces were rated as fair, and no regions were rated as poor (Fig. 5  ). China's eco-environmental quality index increased from 39.38 in 2000 to 62.47 in 2019, with an average growth rate of 2.46% annually, indicating that China's eco-environmental quality is gradually improving and has shown an overall trend of improvement (Fig. 5 ), which has contributed significantly to the achievement of SDG 15.1–15.5 involving forest, wetland ecological restoration, preventing land degradation and desertification, and preserving biodiversity. The provinces with the fastest annual growth rates in the eco-environmental quality included Ningxia, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Qinghai, Beijing, Gansu, Chongqing, Hebei, and Xinjiang. But there is still a large gap between the current eco-environmental quality and the excellent level. The task of improving environmental quality remains arduous.  4.5 Human settlement environmental quality Each Indicator of the human settlement environmental quality has accelerated. China's urban sewage treatment rate continued to rise from 34.25% to 96.72% during 2000–2019, rising from poor to excellent level. The harmless treatment rate of municipal solid waste increased from 44.44% to 99.20%, rising from fair to excellent level. The green coverage rate of the built-up area increased from 29.40% to 41.50%, rising from general to good level. The coverage of sanitary toilets in rural areas increased from 44.8 to 67.40%, improving from poor to good level. Rural biomass fuel use per capita decreased from 767.29 to 282.73kg/capita, increasing from fair to good level. The human settlement environmental quality of China showed high in southeast and low in northwest, and this index increased rapidly in all regions (Fig. 6  ). Most of the evaluation levels of specific indicators also showed similar characteristics, indicating that there is a strong correlation between the improvement of human settlement environment and the level of regional socio-economic development. In 2019, the highest human settlements environmental quality index was found in Beijing (94.45), Zhejiang (89.06), Tianjin (87.99), Jiangsu (87.81), and Guangdong (86.64). The lowest were in Tibet (59.02), Heilongjiang (62.25), Chongqing (65.42), and Qinghai (66.16), which were still at the general level. The provinces with the lowest human settlement quality are mainly in northwest and southwest with poor climatic conditions and fragile ecological environment. In order to achieve balanced development of human settlements in China, great attention should be paid to the optimization and improvement of human settlements in these areas. China's human settlement environmental quality has improved significantly (Fig. 6 ). It rose from 23.48 in 2000 to 77.73 in 2019, with an average growth rate of 6.5% annually. This shows that implementing policies on the improvement of living environment has been effective, so making a step closer to achieving SDG6.b, SDG 7.2, and SDG 11.6. The human settlements environment experienced two stages: from 2000 to 2006, the period of slow growth increased from 23.48 to 31.46, it remained at the fair level; from 2006 to 2019, the period of rapid growth increased from 31.46 to 77.73, it improved from fair to good level, showing an overall trend of improvement. The provinces with the fastest annual average growth rate of human settlements quality index from 2000 to 2019 included Tibet, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Chongqing.  4.6 Total environmental quality The total environmental quality continued to rise from 46.27 in 2000 to 53.2 in 2010, and then to 72.63 in 2019 (Fig. 7  ). The net increase of the total environmental quality index in the past 20 years was 26.36, especially being 13.57 since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012. Accounting for 58.09% of the net increase of the environmental quality index in the past 20 years, it shows that China has achieved remarkable results in deepening the reform of the ecological civilization system and implementing various environmental protection and ecological improvement policies. From 2000 to 2019, the annual average growth rate of the total environmental quality was 2.40%. Before the 18th CPC National Congress, the annual average growth rate of the total environmental quality was 1.33%, and the annual average growth rate has increased to 3.89% since the 18th CPC National Congress, indicating that the 18th CPC National Congress has played a huge role in promoting the improvement of total environmental quality. Over the past 20 years, the environmental quality in various regions has continued to rise (Fig. 9 ). The provinces with the largest increase of total environmental quality include Sichuan, Chongqing, Hubei, Henan, Guizhou, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia, and the provinces with the least increase are Hainan and Tibet. In recent 20 years, Sichuan, Henan, Chongqing, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, and Shanxi have the fastest growth rate of total environmental quality, while Hainan, Tibet, and Guangxi have the slowest. The provinces with the highest environmental quality in 2019 were Hainan (81.49), Zhejiang (81.46), Fujian (80.86), and Qinghai (80.42), which had entered the excellent level (Fig. 9 ). Shanxi, with the lowest environmental quality index of 58.48, is still at the general level. The differences between natural and ecological background conditions, resource endowment conditions and economic and social development basis are the main reasons for the differences in total environmental quality. For instance, Qinghai Province is known as the “Chinese Water Tower” and the “Source of Three Rivers”, and is an extremely important ecological barrier in China. It is a strategic location for maintaining national ecological security. Over 90% of Qinghai's land is in restricted or prohibited development zones, and ecological environmental protection must be taken as the basic premise and rigid constraint for high-quality development. In recent years, Qinghai has insisted on implementing new initiatives for environmental protection on all fronts, consciously and actively exploring and promoting reforms in ecological protection, and has achieved hard-won results. Air environmental quality index, water environmental quality index, soil environmental quality index, eco-environmental quality index and human settlements environmental quality index all showed a trend of steady improvement during 2000–2019, with increases of 11.43, 27.64, 20.52, 23.09, and 54.25, respectively (Fig. 8   ). Among them, the human settlement environmental quality index increased the fastest by 6.50% annually, followed by ecological environmental quality index (2.46%), water environmental quality index (2.45%), soil environmental quality index (1.83%), and air environmental quality index (0.84%). In 2019, China's air environmental quality index, water environmental quality index, soil environmental quality index, eco-environmental quality index and human settlement environmental quality index reached the good level. Soil environmental quality index increased slowly from 2000 to 2016, but increased rapidly after 2016. Air environmental quality showed a downward trend from 2000 to 2011, and only increased steadily after 2011. Eco-environmental and soil environmental quality are still the weak points by contrast. From 2000 to 2019, the total environmental quality across China improved. In 2000, the environmental quality index in all regions was generally low, with most of them at the general level and even some of them at the fair level. Since 2010, there has been an overall improvement. Nearly half of China moved to good status in 2013; In 2019, all the other regions except Shanxi were upgraded to good level, with four provinces being the first to enter the excellent grade (Fig. 9 ). This overall change testifies to the unprecedented achievements of China's comprehensive national measures to control environmental pollution.  4.7 Environment and economy coordination The coordinated development pattern between the environment and economy is increasingly improved overall. In detail, the coordination development level is high in the east and low in the west. All the areas of serious disorder are decreasing and the areas of primary coordination are increasing (Fig. 10  ). In 2000, 15 regions located in the northwest were seriously disordered between economic growth and environmental development, and the other regions present mild disorder. By 2019, there were only eight mild disorder regions: Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Guizhou. Other regions have been upgraded to the primary coordination level or above, and Guangdong province has reached the moderate coordination level. Guangdong is China's largest economic province. In recent years, it has introduced a series of overall and strategic ecological and environmental protection policies to protect the environment with the strictest rules. For example, in 2012, Guangdong issued the Guangdong Functional Zone Plan, taking the lead in establishing and implementing the spatial control policy of strict ecological control zones. In 2015, the newly revised Environmental Protection Regulations of Guangdong Province was officially implemented, becoming the first provincial environmental protection regulations in China after implementing the new Environmental Protection Law. Guangdong has also established a lifelong accountability system for ecological and environmental damage. In 2016, it issued the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Accountability for Ecological and Environmental Damage by Leading Party and Government Officials in Guangdong Province. In 2017, Guangdong was the first in China to introduce a provincial environmental protection supervision program. Adhering to the new development concept, Guangdong has maintained medium-to-high economic growth while continuously improving its environmental quality, making it a leading region in the coordinated development of economy and environment. This fully demonstrates the great achievements made in China's ecological civilization construction. In the early 2010s, China proposed to give priority to ecological progress and integrate it into all aspects and the whole process of economic, political, cultural, and social development, to achieve sustainable development. It also echoes the essence of sustainable development goals, the coordinated development of economy and environment.   5 Discussion and policy implication Our research supports a well-known rule: the “environmental Kuznets curve.” In the early stage, the overall environment did not improve significantly with the social-economic development, especially from 2000 to 2005; From 2005 to 2010, most of China's territory was still in the first half of the inflection point of the curve. In this case, even though governments at all levels took various short-term extreme measures on environmental protection (State Council, 2000 , 2002 , 2006 ; 2011b ; LGO, 2004 ), the effect was not obvious and the decline in environmental quality could not be truly reversed. After 2010, most of the regions experienced continued ascension obviously in the environmental quality, which is inseparable from the derived various effect economic growth bring to the environmental quality, such as scale effect, structure effect and technology effect, also with the national constantly strengthened environmental law and policies (State Council, 2011a , 2013 , 2015 ). From the spatial dimension, the environmental quality level in the eastern region is not better than that in the western region in the early stage, but obviously exceeds that in the late stage. This is especially obvious in southeast coastal areas. China's environmental protection problem lies precisely in the serious imbalance between the economic and environmental systems (see this study), resulting in the mutual deviation of economic and environmental efficiency, and then the distortion of resource allocation. We should establish a relatively unobstructed transmission relationship between economic growth and environmental quality by following the internal law of interaction between systems and realize a dynamic equilibrium from cost to output maintaining coordinated development. Only in this way can economic growth exert negative effects on environmental quality and finally realize the improvement of environmental quality. We should promote the rebalancing of economic growth and environmental protection by various means, restore their normal price relation (Worlanyo and Jiangfeng, 2021 ), and enable the free flow of various factors between the economic and environmental sectors (Panayotou, 2016 ). Strengthening regional cooperation and exchange, increasing the conversion rate of energy, promoting industrial technological innovation and increasing the utilization rate of environmental protection investment are important ways to put economy and environment on the track of coordinated and sustainable development (Song et al., 2020 ). It is necessary to construct a comprehensive multi-regional joint governance mechanism to strictly control the cross-regional migration of pollutants in the process of industrial structure optimization and upgrading (Fang et al., 2019 ). Improving ecological resilience is key to sustainably improving the quality of the ecological environment, and investment in environmental improvement, green technology innovation and industrial upgrading are the main drivers of improving ecological resilience (Li et al., 2023 ). The eastern and western regions should establish a mechanism for collaborative technological innovation. In addition to providing funds, the eastern region should also provide support and assistance to the western region in terms of advanced technologies, institutions and mechanisms, and personnel training (Fan et al., 2019 ). Both the ecological environment and soil are in a relatively weak level. We should continue to promote the integrated protection and systematic management of mountains, rivers, forests, fields, lakes, grass, sand and ice, improve the ecological environment management system and use a variety of control means (Wang et al., 2022 ). Broaden the financing channels of governance, and constantly improve the market-oriented investment and financing mechanism (Abid, 2017 ); We will effectively improve oversight and supervision in a scientific way, further improve the effectiveness of ecological environmental governance, scientifically arrange the number and timing of tasks, and effectively make eco-environmental governance measures more systematic and effective. In addition, soil pollution is hidden and cumulative, and it is difficult to control, so it is very important to strengthen the prevention and control of the pollution source. It is necessary to regularly monitor the soil environment around the key supervision units of soil pollution and the farmland of edible agricultural products (Muñoz-Rojas, 2018 ). Measures for the prevention and control of soil pollution should be taken by producers and operators in key industries such as crude oil transportation, washing and dyeing, maintenance of motor vehicles and vessels, agricultural production and activities involving toxic and harmful substances, to strengthen the prevention and control of soil pollution in primary, secondary and tertiary industries (Hou and Li, 2017 ). The continuous improvement of air environmental quality reflects the promotion of SDG3.9 and 11.6, and water environmental quality reflects the improvement of SDG 3.9, 6.3 and 6.6. Soil environmental quality underwent constant bettering, indicating the advancement of SDG2.4 and 3.9; ecological environment quality made substantial progress which proves SDG 6.6, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5 improved; The great rise of human settlement quality reflects the improvement of SDG 6.b,7.2,11.6. The overall environmental quality evolution progress corresponds to China's achievements towards the SDGs. Adapting environmental policies and measures adhere to regional characteristics, involving resource condition, economic development status, political management level and social organization development degree, can effectively promote sustainable development. In order to monitor the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, urgent measures are needed to improve the quality, coverage and availability of disaggregated data. In addition, China needs to collect good practices, successful cases and lessons that can be spread to the world. There is still a large gap between environmental quality and the target, and there are significant regional differences in environmental quality. In 2019, China's total environmental quality was 72.63, which is 7.37 short of excellent and 27.37 short of the target of 100. Among them, air environmental quality index was 77.93, in the good grade, 2.07 short of the excellent grade, 23.07 short of the target value of 100; water environmental quality index was 74.91, which was in the good grade, 5.09 short of the excellent grade and 25.09 short of the target value. Soil environmental quality was 70.44, being in good grade, 9.56 short of excellent grade and 29.56 short of the target value. The eco-environmental quality was 62.47, still in the general grade, 17.53 short of the excellent grade, and 37.53 short of the target value of 100. The human settlement environmental quality index was 77.73, which was in the good grade, 2.27 short of the excellent grade, and 22.27 short of the target value. Meanwhile, big gaps exist between the current situation of environmental quality and the target in most areas. In 2019, Hainan, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Qinghai were already rated excellent. In addition, Tibet, Sichuan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Jilin, Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei were very close to the excellent grade in total environmental quality. The total environmental quality of Inner Mongolia, Henan, Gansu, Hebei, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Shanxi provinces is less than 70, far from the excellent level. Among them, Shanxi has the largest gap between its total environmental quality and the excellent grade, followed by Xinjiang. Local governments should formulate more detailed and targeted action plans. Different targets should be set for various regions according to the magnitude of improvement in environmental quality to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach. For example, Henan should advance the improvement of air quality, and continue to optimize the industrial structure, energy structure, transportation structure, land use structure and agricultural input structure. Henan needs to strictly control the construction of projects with high energy consumption and high emissions, and resolutely eliminate outdated production capacity. Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang should speed up the promotion of water environmental quality. They should work to protect the ecological environment of rivers and lakes, speed up the elimination of polluted water, carry out the supervision and remediation of sewage outlets into rivers, and strengthen the standardized construction of drinking-water sources. They should promote the construction and renovation of urban sewage collection networks, promote the reuse of sewage resources, and set up demonstration projects for water reclamation and reuse. This study is only aimed at the analysis of the overall environmental situation, which is insufficient to explore the internal mechanism of the environmental system; and it uses traditional, more granular data and scales and does not investigate and analyze fine-scale data and specific scales. In addition, this study does not consider the important impact of groundwater extraction, an important water source, on the geological and ecological environment (Huang et al., 2022a ). The next step should focus on selecting several important related factors in the economy-environment system and establishing corresponding index system by analyzing them, so as to carry out specific analysis on the mechanism of the role of economy and environment and study various types of regional economic and environmental optimization regulation models at different levels and scales. As the economic-environmental system is a complex giant system, various methods such as systematics, economics and ecology should be adopted in the practical research work, and the technical support system such as GIS, GPS and RS technology should be combined. And computer aided decision support systems, such as system dynamics model, input-output model, system integration model combining quantitative and qualitative factors, could be used to make quantitative analysis of the strength, potential and risk, and optimize and regulate the economy-environment system.  6 Conclusions In the past 20 years, China's total environmental quality has improved, and the improvement speed has been significantly accelerated. China has made considerable progress in all aspects of environmental quality, among which the human settlements environmental quality has increased by an average of 6.5% per year, followed by eco-environmental quality (2.46%), water environmental quality (2.45%), soil environmental quality (1.83%), and air environmental quality (0.84%), respectively. Soil environmental quality and air environmental quality, by contrast, still need more attention. All these achievements reflect a historic, turning point and overall change in China's ecological progress from recognition to practice, substantially supporting the implementations and achievements of SDGs in China. China's total environmental quality always showed a spatial characteristic of high in southeast and low in northwest. From 2000 to 2019, the total environmental quality in different regions of China showed varying degrees of improvement, but there were significant regional differences. In 2000, Hainan had the highest environmental quality (67.59) and Shanxi had the lowest (36.3). By 2019, Hainan still had the highest environmental quality (81.49), followed by Zhejiang (81.46), Fujian (80.86) and Qinghai (80.42). These four provinces have entered the excellent level of total environmental quality. Shanxi, with the lowest environmental quality of 58.48, is still at the general level. The coordinated development degree between China's economy and environment has improved since 2000. Spatially, the coordinated development degree is higher in the east and lower in the west. As of 2019, Guangdong has entered the stage of moderate coordination, playing a role model for other regions in the coordinated development between environment and economy. In addition, 22 provinces have entered the primary coordination stage. The eight western provinces are still in the stage of mild disorder. They should focus on promoting ecological progress, improving ecological compensation mechanisms, strengthening environmental improvement, especially improving urban air environment and rural living environment, and preventing and controlling agricultural non-point source pollution. Our study provides key information that could affect decision making especially considering the option of development mode for China's sustainability that would meet the concrete needs of the SDGs. The next research will focus on the interaction and synergistic correlation between air, water, soil, ecology and human settlements.
