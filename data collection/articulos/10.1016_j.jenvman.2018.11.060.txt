                  The attainment of sustainable development in water and sanitation i.e. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) requires a comprehensive monitoring and knowledge base of social and economic water needs at national scale in such a way that should not cause negative environmental manifestations from regional to global scale. India holds a key position among developing economies with a complex interconnected web of fast-growing population, coupled with biophysical stress, social deprivation and economic inequality related to utilization, availability and access to water resources and sanitation facilities. This study addresses some of these challenges related to monitoring and implementation of the targets of the UN SDG 6 in India. Acknowledging the contribution of society and economy in sustainability paradigm, here we have chosen 28 indicators (clustered into 11 dimensions) under two major groups, concerning biophysical and social development aspects of water and sanitation. We have shown declining level of per capita biophysical water resource and slow to rapidly developing societal indicators related to SDG 6 in India. From past trends, we have calculated probable scenario of biophysical consumption of India up to 2050. We have also analysed the interrelationship of water and sanitation (SDG 6) with health (SDG 3) and end to poverty (SDG 1) in India. These show a positive impact of increasing per capita GDP on improving sanitation related indicators, which in turn positively influence to reduce water and sanitation related diseases, especially in children and aged population. This cumulative assessment framework contributes a tool to prioritize water resource appropriation and assessment of sanitation, management response and policy implementations to national level inclusive sustainability of water and sanitation sector, keeping in mind the societal and economic development scenario in India.

The attainment of sustainable development in water and sanitation i.e. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) requires a comprehensive monitoring and knowledge base of social and economic water needs at national scale in such a way that should not cause negative environmental manifestations from regional to global scale. India holds a key position among developing economies with a complex interconnected web of fast-growing population, coupled with biophysical stress, social deprivation and economic inequality related to utilization, availability and access to water resources and sanitation facilities. This study addresses some of these challenges related to monitoring and implementation of the targets of the UN SDG 6 in India. Acknowledging the contribution of society and economy in sustainability paradigm, here we have chosen 28 indicators (clustered into 11 dimensions) under two major groups, concerning biophysical and social development aspects of water and sanitation. We have shown declining level of per capita biophysical water resource and slow to rapidly developing societal indicators related to SDG 6 in India. From past trends, we have calculated probable scenario of biophysical consumption of India up to 2050. We have also analysed the interrelationship of water and sanitation (SDG 6) with health (SDG 3) and end to poverty (SDG 1) in India. These show a positive impact of increasing per capita GDP on improving sanitation related indicators, which in turn positively influence to reduce water and sanitation related diseases, especially in children and aged population. This cumulative assessment framework contributes a tool to prioritize water resource appropriation and assessment of sanitation, management response and policy implementations to national level inclusive sustainability of water and sanitation sector, keeping in mind the societal and economic development scenario in India.   Keywords SDG 6  National water security  Planetary boundaries  Safe and just operating space  Water and sanitation  India    1 Introduction India is going through a time of deterioration of the environment, social deprivation and inefficient economy, combined with rapidly growing population, have initiated progress of ‘Anthropocene’ (Steffen et al. 2011 , 2015 ; Ellis et al., 2013 ; Halarnkar, 2015 ). To mitigate these, the concept of sustainable development was established, which is “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland Commission Report, 1987 ). In 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit), Agenda 21, calls for sustainable development indicators (SDIs) to “provide solid bases for decision-making at all levels and to contribute to a self-regulating sustainability of integrated environment and development system”. Emerging from Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), United Nations has set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets in 2015 (United Nations General Assembly, 2015 ). SDGs incorporate three pillars of sustainable development, i.e. environmental (climate action, life below water, life on land etc.), social (zero hunger, no poverty, gender equality, peace and justice and strong institutions etc.) and economic development (reduced inequalities, decent work and economic growth etc.) (Sachs, 2012 ). SDG 6 aims to ‘ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’. It has eight targets, concerning a number of issues, such as –universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all (6.1), adequate and equitable sanitation for all and end to open defecation (6.2), improvement of water quality through reduction of water pollution (6.3), increase of water use efficiency across all sectors and reduce number of people suffering from water scarcity (6.4), implementation of integrated water resource management at all levels (6.5), protect and restore the health of water-related ecosystems (6.6), international cooperation and capacity building in developing countries through wastewater treatment, desalination, recycling and reuse technologies etc. (6. a) and participation of local communities for improvement of water and sanitation (6. b). Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030 (6.1–6.5 and 6. a), one by the year 2020 (6.6) and remaining one has no target year (6. b). There is a distinct trend that was set from the 1970s, especially from 1990s, that led to the contextual understanding and necessity for this study. It can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, the significance of managing water resource sustainably was studied and advocated. Almost all of the works, concerned only with environmental aspect of water resource management. From the 1990s, the significance of the sustainable development of water resources has been increasing steadily. Biswas (1991 , 1992)  emphasised on an analytical framework for drivers of the water crisis, socio-environmental considerations along with institutional responses for better management. More than two decades ago, Serageldin (1995)  had proposed ‘water resource management’ as a policy tool for sustainable future. Gleick (1996)  recommended that international organizations, national and local governments, with water providers adopt a ‘basic water requirement’ standard for human needs (i.e. 50 L per person per day) and promise to access this irrespective of an individual's economic, social, or political status. In another work, Gleick (1998)  proposed seven ‘sustainability criteria’ related to ‘Basic Water Requirement’ (BWR) to restructure long-term water planning. These criteria included – basic water requirement for the need and health of both human and ecosystems, water quality monitoring, institutional mechanism for water-related conflict resolution, water planning and decision making etc. Postel (2000)  advocated a new water management paradigm which balances both ecological and economic functions of water by increasing water productivity (performing more functions with less water). Vörösmarty et al. (2000)  have assessed the vulnerability of global water resource from both climate change and population growth. Jackson et al. (2001)  analysed changes in water resources and projected future scenario for the USA. Vörösmarty et al. (2010)  presented a global synthesis that jointly considers both human and biodiversity perspective on water security. In the second phase, both economic and societal aspects began to be recognized as important in studies of sustainability analysis. In 2009, Rockström et al., 2009a,b  devised a framework to understand if anthropogenic biophysical resource consumption has already exceeded or is going to surpass safe limits – ‘planetary boundaries’. This work marked the global onset of biophysical resource consumption monitoring in recent years. Then, Steffen et al. (2015)  modified and improved the framework. One of the main problems in this work is that the indicators used in these works had not been corroborated completely with UN SDGs. Also, the socioeconomic dimension was miss. This was accomplished by Raworth (2012) , through the incorporation of the social deprivation indicators. This acted as a complementary to planetary boundary framework and together formed ‘doughnut economy’ that touched all three pillars of sustainability – environment, economy and society. Water and sanitation are strongly related to public health too. Works in this area have also increased (Bartram et al, 2005 , 2014 ; Moe and Rheingans, 2006 ; Montgomery and Elimelech, 2007 ; Bartram and Cairncross, 2010 ). There has been an important discussion ongoing that specifically signifies water and sustainable development is perceived from this water-perspective (Bogardi et al., 2012 ; Madrid et al., 2013 ; Bhaduri et al., 2016 ; Ait-Kadi, 2016 ). Recently, Gleick (2018)  has addressed the concept of resource transitions in the context of freshwater to identify key policies to help manage effective and successful transitions. There has been some work on the appropriation of water resources and its management in India (Kumar et al., 2005 ; van Koppen and Shah, 2006 ; Mall et al., 2006 ; Mujumdar, 2008 ). There has been some work on sanitation in India too on various aspects, like – women's role (Hulland et al., 2015 ; Padhi et al., 2015 ; Kulkarni et al., 2017 ; Routray et al., 2017 ), urban sanitation (Wankhade, 2015 ), rural sanitation (Brocklehurst, 2014 ; De, 2018 ), progress of sanitation in India (Ghosh and Cairncross, 2014 ; Manisha, 2018 ), reducing child death rate via improved sanitation (Humphrey, 2009 ; Rah et al., 2015 ; Nandi et al., 2016 ; Dearden et al., 2017 ), disease burden caused by poor water and sanitation facilities (Kumar et al., 2011 ; Clasen et al., 2014 ) etc. An important lacuna is that none of these works incorporated socioeconomic dimensions in sustainability analysis of water resource and sanitation. Therefore, all of these studies logically imply towards the need for a national-scale study on the sustainable development of water and sanitation that includes all three dimensions of sustainable development, namely environment, society and economy together. That's why this study was performed. There is no national level study present, focusing on both biophysical and socioeconomic aspects of SDG 6 i.e. sustainable development of water and sanitation. In this work, we have tried to find answers to the following: (1) How can we downscale SDG 6 indicators to a national scale more accurately? (2) How can we understand changes in dimensions of SDG 6 with time in order to contextualize their present values? (3) How can we use the past trends in per capita biophysical consumptions under SDG 6 to project probable future biophysical resource consumption at a national scale? (4) How are betterment of water and sanitation is connected to well-being and health (SDG 3) and end of poverty (SDG 1)? This analysis measures the national performance of India on SDG 6 through eleven dimensions, consisting of 28 indicators, segregated into two groups, namely biophysical and social development indicators, provides important findings of the relationship between biophysical resource use and well-being related to water and sanitation for India. Our work has been explained herein few steps. We first present our methodology; then results of our study on India; project probable future scenario of biophysical consumption for India; link water and sanitation to health and ending poverty in India; interpret all the results from our analysis; discuss limitations and scopes of this study; the applicability of SDG 6 as a tool in policymaking and necessities for future improvements in this research field.  2 Data and method We have collected the data related to SDG 6 of India from Aquastat , FAOSTAT  and World development indicators (World Bank ). As three main pillars of sustainable development are the environment, society, and economy, we also clubbed all SDG 6 associated indicators into two broad categories – biophysical and social development indicators, following planetary boundaries framework (Rockström et al., 2009a,b ; Steffen et al., 2015a,b ) and doughnut economics framework (Raworth, 2012 , 2017a,b ), respectively. 2.1 Biophysical indicators We analysed 11 indicators under four dimensions that indicate biophysical aspects of SDG 6. These are –(1) water withdrawal (four indicators), (2) water availability (three indicators), (3) wastewater (three indicators) and (4) water stress, WS (one indicator). We have calculated every biophysical indicator on per capita basis (top-down approach) (except – water stress, expressed in percentage, %) by dividing total values with population data of India, available from FAOSTAT database . We have tried to include indicators for water pollution, water scarcity, the condition of water-related ecosystems and water footprint. Either no unanimously accepted indicator is available or there is no established database with annual data for the significantly longer duration. So, we could not include any indicator representing these dimensions. The details of each biophysical indicator along with duration, current status, change etc. are provided in Table 1  .  2.2 Social development indicators We have analysed 17 indicators under seven dimensions that indicate social development aspects related to SDG 6. These are –(1) open defecation, OD (three indicators), (2) basic drinking water resources, BDWR (three indicators), (3) basic sanitation services, BSS (three indicators), (4) safely managed drinking water services, SMDWS (one indicator), (5) improved sanitation facilities, ISF (three indicators), (6) improved water source, IWS (three indicators) and (7) water use efficiency, WUE (one indicator). We have also set a desirable threshold for social development indicators to get a better understanding of gaps between current status and desired status that can be reasonably accepted as the well-developed situation of SDG 6 for India. These are – less than 10% people for open defecation and 90% or more people for rest of five dimensions (excluding water use efficiency, WUE). We have also calculated the approximate time when desired thresholds were or will be met for social development indicators (excluding water use efficiency, WUE) using linear interpolation at business-as-usual, BAU scenario. The details of each social development indicator along with duration, current status, change etc. are provided in Table 2  .  2.3 Planetary boundary of freshwater use According to Rockström et al. (2009a,b) , the planetary boundary of freshwater use is the maximum withdrawal of 4000 km3  y−1  blue water from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and renewable groundwater stores. We have divided it with the World population (from World Bank) to get per capita global scale boundary of 576.96  km3  y−1  (for the year 2010).  2.4 Future scenario As we have calculated most of the biophysical indicators on per capita basis (except – water stress, in %), it is possible to project probable future scenario of total consumption. We collected future population projection (2015–2050) data (median range prediction value of 50%) of India from the UN DESA (2017 Revision)  and then multiplied it with per capita consumption indicators (n = 9) of SDG 6. We have calculated three projection series for each of nine indicators of SDG 6, (i) with the lowest value that has happened in past year, (ii) highest value that has happened in past year and (iii) business-as-usual, BAU scenario with latest year of available data.  2.5 Interrelationship of water and sanitation (SDG 6) with health (SDG 3) and ending poverty (SDG 1) To understand the relationship between SDG 6 and SDG 3, we have used five indicators. These are – (1) child mortality rate (per 1000 live births), (2) prevalence of stunting, height for age (% of children under 5 y), (3) annual deaths from diarrhoeal diseases (according to age group), (4) death rate from diarrhoeal diseases (per 100,000) (according to age group) and (5) risk factor of water and sanitation related deaths (according to age group). (1) and (2) have been seen in accordance with open defecation rate (% of population) and improved sanitation facilities (% of population with access), respectively. In risk factor of water and sanitation related deaths, five age groups (i.e. under 5years, 5–14years, 15–49years, 50–69years and 70years+) have been divided into three types, (1) risk of deaths from no access to hand washing facility (NAHF), (2) risk of deaths from poor sanitation (PS) and (3) risk of deaths from unsafe water source (UWS). For water and sanitation related deaths and risk of deaths, the age groups have been divided in five types, i.e. under 5years, 5–14years, 15–49years, 50–69years and 70years+. To understand the relationship between SDG 6 and SDG 1, we have used six indicators and have seen their changes in accordance with GDP per capita (current US $). These are – (1) basic drinking water services, BDWS (% of population with access), (2) basic sanitation services, BSS (% of population with access), (3) improved sanitation facilities, ISF (% of population with access), (4) improved water source, IWS (% of population with access), (5) open defecation, OD (% of population) and (6) safely managed drinking water services, SMDWS (% of population with access). Data for this section has been collected from World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2018 ) and Global burden of disease (GBD, 2016 ).   3 Results 3.1 Biophysical indicators Among the 11 indicators concerning biophysical aspects of SDG 6, four have decreased and seven have increased over time (Table 1 ). Total water withdrawals per capita have increased (3.07%). Municipal water withdrawal has also increased significantly (60.06%). For domestic use in 2050, India would probably require 111 billion m3  water. Top 6 domestic water consuming states (more than 8 billion m3  water) would be – Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh (Supplementary Fig. 1 ) (IndiaStat, 2018 ). Total annual water requirement is increasing steadily in India. In 2050, water requirement is going to be almost three times the requirement of 1990. Water demand for power generation is going to increase more in 2025 and 2050 (Supplementary Fig. 2 ) (IndiaStat, 2018 ). Dam capacity per capita has increased (38.12%). Produced and treated municipal wastewater has increased significantly (64.68% and 58.86%, respectively). But not treated municipal wastewater has increased more (67.58%). Water stress has also increased (18.4%). Current water stress level in India (44.53%) is almost four times more than average global level of water stress (12.82%). Changes of biophysical consumption indicators are depicted in Fig. 1   .  3.2 Social development indicators Of the 17 indicators of social development aspects of SDG 6, four have decreased and 13 have increased over time (Table 2 ). Open defecation rate in India has decreased in all three cases, overall (26.14%), rural (26.59%) and urban (16.08%). For global average values, these have decreased 8.32% (overall), 10.59% (rural) and 2.69% (urban). Urban open defecation rate has already met with the desired threshold (10% or less) in 2013. Remaining two (i.e. rural and overall rate of open defecation) will not be able to meet SDG criteria at this BAU rate within 2030 (2030–35 and 2035–40, respectively), as – improvement is not enough within UN SDG timeline (i.e. 2030). On average, 35.09% villages in India are open-defecation free as of 2017. Four are lowest (0%) among them (Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Goa and Puducherry) and five have highest (100%) achievement (Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Sikkim and Uttarakhand) (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Water use efficiency in agriculture has also decreased significantly (76.16%) which is good, i.e. less amount of water is being withdrawn for the same amount of GDP (in current US$, 2010). Basic drinking water services has also increased in India (overall, 7.15%; rural, 9.16% and urban, 0.44%). For global average values, these have increased 8.45% (overall), 12.58% (rural) (remained almost same, 95.2% for urban area). Basic drinking water in urban areas has already met with a desirable threshold (90% or more) before 2000. Remaining two will also be able to meet SDG criteria at this rate within 2030 (2020 and 2020–25, respectively). Basic sanitation services have increased in India (overall, 22.47%; rural, 23.27% and urban, 14.59%). For global average values, these have increased 9.99% (overall), 11.66% (rural) and 3.68% (urban). But, none of the 3, in India will be able to meet desired SDG criteria within 2030 (2045, 2050–2055 and 2040 respectively). Immediate steps are needed to improve awareness and basic sanitation system. Safely managed drinking water services in rural Indian population have also increased over time (20.19%). For global average values, these have increased 9.74% (overall), 13.86% (rural) and 0.23% (urban). But it will also not be able to meet desired SDG threshold within 2030 (2045). Improved sanitation facilities have also increased over time (overall, 22.8%; rural, 22.9% and urban, 13.3%). For global average values, these have increased 14.63% (overall), 16.16% (rural) and 3.44% (urban). As none of the 3 indicators in India will be able to meet desired SDG criteria within 2030 (2065–2070, 2075–2080 and 2060–2065 respectively), improvement of sanitation services requires serious attention in India (both rural and urban area). Improved water source has increased over time (overall, 23.6%; rural, 28.4% and urban, 8.2%). For global average values, these have increased 14.87% (overall), 22.41% (rural) and 1.28% (urban). All of these 3 indicators have already meet desired SDG criteria in India (2010, 2012 and 1994 respectively). To sum up, in India, among 16 indicators with desirable thresholds, seven have either already met or going to meet SDG criteria within 2030, one indicator will reach the target just after 2030, and remaining 8, at current rate, will be able to meet in distant future (2040–2080), requiring immediate attention. Changes in social development indicators over time are seen in Fig. 1 .  3.3 Planetary boundary of freshwater use at the national scale From this analysis, we can see that Indian per capita total water withdrawal (2010) has already crossed global average freshwater use PB (576.96 m3 , 2010). This means that with growing population it would be tougher for to achieve UN SDG 6 targets remaining under safe biophysical limits of freshwater resource use (see Fig. 2 ).  3.4 Future of water and sanitation (SDG 6) Fig. 3   shows total amount of probable biophysical consumption up to 2050 in nine graphs. In 2050, if lowest per capita rate can be maintained, total water withdrawal would increase 18.98%, at a business-as-usual rate, it would increase 25.8% and at highest per capita rate, it would increase 26.57%. It means, even with grown population level of 2050, it is possible to lower the rate of total water withdrawal 6.8–7.5%which is a significant amount. In agricultural water withdrawal in 2050, at lowest per capita rate, it would increase 20.98%; at a business-as-usual rate, it would increase 25.8% and at highest per capita rate, it would increase 29.1%. Agricultural water withdrawal might to be 1.4 times more in 2050 than 2010. For industrial water withdrawal, in 2050, at lowest per capita rate, it would decrease 7.72% which is a very positive scenario. But at a business-as-usual rate, industrial water withdrawal would increase 25.8% and at highest per capita rate, it would increase 57.7% in 2050. For municipal water withdrawal, at lowest per capita rate, it would decrease 46.18% in 2050 which is a positive scenario, whereas for business-as-usual (this is also highest per capita) rate, it would increase 25.8%. For produced municipal wastewater, in 2050, it is possible to reduce it to 53.02% maintaining lowest per capita rate. Otherwise, at business-as-usual (highest per capita) rate, it would increase 24.82%. Municipal wastewater production might be 1.3 times more in 2050 than 2011. For treated municipal wastewater, it would decrease to 60.71% maintaining lowest per capita rate. But at business-as-usual (highest per capita) rate of wastewater treatment, amount of treated municipal wastewater would increase 24.82% which is also positive scenario. For non-treated municipal wastewater, it is possible to decrease it to 56.83% maintaining lowest per capita rate in 2050. At business-as-usual (highest per capita) rate, it would increase 24.82% which paints a bleak future of India. This non-treated municipal wastewater might be 1.33 times more in 2050 than 2011. Both total renewable water resource and total internal renewable water resource, if lowest per capita (which is also business-as-usual) rate can be maintained by India, only 22% more renewable water resource will be needed in 2050. Otherwise, it would plunge to 72.15% if highest rate of renewable water resource per capita is to be maintained.  3.5 Interrelationship of water and sanitation (SDG 6) with health (SDG 3) and end of poverty (SDG 1) Open defecation rate has decreased 26.7% in India and also, child mortality rate has decreased 78.1 (per 1000 live births) in the same time. At global average level, these values have also decreased 13.18% and 48.1, respectively. Access to improved sanitation facilities has increased 22.7% and, with that, prevalence of stunting, height for age (% of children under 5y) has decreased 27.5%. Also, at global average level, these values have increased 14.61% and decreased 16.6%, respectively. With increasing access to improvement of sanitation facilities and water sources, number of annual deaths from diarrhoeal diseases have decreased (1990–2016), in both India and the World. Among the five age groups (i.e. under 5y, 5-14y, 15-49y, 50-69y and 70y+), under 5years is the most affected age group, though, it has also decreased the most among other age groups, both for India and the World. Death rates from diarrhoeal diseases have also decreased, especially for under 5years, 50–69 years and 70 years+, for both India and the World. For risk factor of deaths from water and sanitation related diseases, 0–5years is the most affected age group and has also improved the most over the years, for all the three types (i.e. no access to hand washing facility, poor sanitation and unsafe water source), for both India and the World. Per capita GDP (current US $) is clearly influencing water and sanitation related developments, both in India and the World, but to varying degrees. For access to basic drinking water services, most changes have been found in overall and rural areas for India, moderate change in overall and rural areas for the World and very less change in urban areas for both India and the World. For access to basic sanitation services, most changes have been found in all rural, overall and urban areas for India, and moderate changes for the World (all rural, overall and urban areas). For access to improved sanitation facilities, most changes have been found in all rural, overall and urban areas for India, moderate changes for overall and rural areas for the World, and very less change in urban areas for the World. For access to improved water sources, most changes have been found in overall and rural areas for India, moderate changes in urban areas for India and overall and rural areas for the World, whereas, very less change for urban areas for the World. For open defecation rate, most changes have been found in all rural, overall and urban areas for India, moderate changes for overall and rural areas for the World, and very less change has been found in urban areas for the World. For access to safely managed drinking water services, most change has been found in rural areas for India, moderate changes in overall and rural areas of the World, and very less change in urban areas of the World (Fig. 4  ).   4 Discussion This study gives a comprehensive and clear understanding about sustainable development of water and sanitation in India. Decrease in both total internal renewable water resource and total renewable water resource is expected, as the population is growing but the available amount of renewable water resource is not. In future, with more population growth, per capita available renewable water resource is likely to decrease further. This problem can be tackled in two ways, (1) control of population growth in India (as – amount of safely usable water in the World is fixed, 4000 km3 , the increased population would need certain amount of water for both basic and improved water source along with equitable access to that water resource. So, inadvertently and inevitably population growth would result in a more per capita stress to water resource, both for availability i.e. biophysically and accessibility i.e. socio-economically) and (2) increasing water productivity, i.e. perform more functions with less amount of water, in another word, becoming more water-efficient. However, decreased industrial water withdrawal might prove to be good, especially for India. More water will be available for agriculture (India has an agriculture-based economy) and domestic consumption (India is going to be one of the highest populated countries in the World). Very less decrease of agricultural water withdrawal coupled with increased population indicates to increase of total amount of agricultural water withdrawal. It means water productivity in agriculture has not increased significantly in India. Therefore, increasing water productivity in agriculture (i.e. growing more amounts of agricultural products using less amount of water, via both direct or indirect use) should be one of the future concerns. As population will increase in future, at present increasing rate of per capita total water withdrawal, water scarcity will be more severe unless proper mitigation strategies are adopted. Some of these strategies could be – (A) increasing agricultural water productivity and irrigation efficiency, improvement of domestic and industrial water use intensity, limiting population growth rate (‘soft measures’) and (B) increasing water storage in reservoirs, increasing desalination of seawater (‘hard measures’) (Wada et al., 2014 ). Significant increase of municipal water withdrawal is probably due to increasing number of urban populations. Thus, in 2050, if 50% of Indian population become urban dwelling (World urban prospects, UN-DESA, 2014 revision ), this is likely to be continued, might even at higher rate. As a result, in future, it might not be possible to provide sufficient water for drinking and sanitation equitably to all urban people. Bringing down indiscriminate use of water by municipality areas is one of the probable solutions, which was attempted by Government of India various times (Times of India, 2002 , The Telegraph, 2018 ). If situation arise to more severe stage, water tax might be considered for implementation, especially for high-income urban localities. It is also a good time to start thinking about possible sources of freshwater in and around urban areas for supply to increased urban population in future. Continuous monitoring to check misuse of municipality provided water is needed. Increased dam capacity per capita means, as population is increasing, more numerous and larger capacity dams are being prepared or going to be needed to prepare in future to maintain this per capita rate. On the one hand, more hydroelectric power is necessary for growing Indian population, on the other hand, adverse effects of present and future construction of dams on aquatic life, especially riverine biota should be kept in mind (LeRoy Poff et al., 2007 ; Vörösmarty et al., 2010 ). Not only aquatic biodiversity is major source of livelihood of millions of people around river basins, but also protection and conservation of aquatic biodiversity is also priority. Increase in not treated municipal wastewater means more amount of wastewater is remaining untreated than treated portion which brings bad effects of wastewater in environment, soil, biodiversity etc. along with it. More wastewater treatment plants or centres accompanied with more recycle and reuse of water are necessary in future. Current water stress level in India indicates that it is steadily increasing and would become more complex problem in future with growing number of Indian populations. This study clearly shows that the per capita biophysical resources are decreasing over time. This trend would continue further with respect to population explosion and growing urbanisation trends in India. Although urban open defecation rate has already met with the desired threshold, it should be also kept in mind that with increasing number of urban populous in coming decades, maintaining this rate might prove to be tougher. So, necessary actions should be made parallelly for implementation if need be in future. To meet the desired threshold in open defecation rate in rural areas, there are 2 possible ways, (1) more public and household toilets are to be constructed in rural areas and (2) spreading awareness about adverse effects of open defecation on environment and health in rural areas. This part (social development related to SDG 6) shows that social developments related to water and sanitations are improving, clearly at the cost of environment. To provide positive social development and maintaining the same while the population is exploding will be tough to handle for the government. Especially, if all of these developments come at the cost of further degradation of the environment. As per our calculations (Fig. 4 ), it is clear that child mortality rate and prevalence of stunting has been improved over the years with improving scenario of open defecation rate and improved sanitation facilities, respectively. Annual deaths from diarrhoeal diseases have also been decreasing with time (1990–2016) with the progress of water and sanitation sector in India. Among the 5 age groups, three (under 5y, 50-69y and 70 + y) are mostly affected by these diarrhoeal diseases, both in India and World average. Death rates also depict the same results for these age groups in a similar way. Risk factor of water and sanitation related deaths are also decreasing over the years (1990–2016), yet comparatively high in children and aged people. We suggest the government should take serious steps to improve access to better water and sanitation facilities, especially for the children and aged people to further lower water and sanitation related deaths in India. Also, the increasing per capita GDP (current US$) clearly has a positive impact in improving the situations of all the 6 indicators (6–11 in Fig. 4 ) in last 25–26 years (1990–2015/16), both in India and the World. Some other research works have also established these type of SDG interconnections with SDG 6 that are similar to our analysis, like – SDG 1 (no poverty), 3 (good health and well-being) and 12 (responsible consumption and production) (Pradhan et al., 2017 ), 2 (zero hunger) and 7 (affordable and clean energy) (Mainali et al., 2018 ), 5 (gender equality), 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land) (Blanc, 2015 ) etc. To sum up, it would be a legitimate argument that if the desired goals are not met by 2030 or regress, these deaths might go up in the coming decades in India. During this study, we were confronted with some problems which we would explain along with probable mitigation strategies. First, availability of biophysical resource consumption data is not good enough. Neither state-level comprehensive data for most of the indicators are available, nor the district or any other lower unit level. Long-term data are not available for most of the indicators which are necessary for more accurate projection of future trends. This would simply create homogeneous outline of resource consumption and access at national level. For the same reason, we were unable to perform any statistical analysis. In future, analysis and freely available data concerning biophysical consumption at state and district level should be prepared and maintained, both for general awareness and scientific research purposes. Also, enough data should be generated to redesign policy framework or restructure governance in accordance with scientific findings. A significant amount of work is due still that can yield adaptive policy to be implemented, customized for local context in India. We think that bottom-up analysis would be more appropriate for implementation and policymaking. For this purpose, data collection, assessment and designing framework for implementation is necessary which should start from village, town or at least district level, then it should move up to national scale. In this way, this analysis of SDG 6 would be more accurate, comprehensive and applicable both for government and citizens of India. Second, abundance and availability of data of different biophysical parameters are much more than different socioeconomic indicators. It shows a clear bias towards the maintenance of biophysical data. This is not suitable for contemporary research works and creates problem to assess sustainability for all three dimensions (i.e. environment, society and development). Third, the set of indicators for sustainable development of water and sanitation sector does not yield a very complete and comprehensive picture of SDG 6 in India, especially in view of the socioeconomic factors that exist within the country and the regional biophysical resource consumption that interact with them. Therefore, there is ample scope for adapting the indicators to better suit India's specific needs in terms of reflecting both regional and national scenario. To this end, additional indicators could be developed. Fourth, as this study only etches the surface of multi-indicator multilevel continuous monitoring of SDG 6, it is not rigorous enough to map synergy and trade-off between SDG 6 and other SDGs (as suggested by Griggs et al. 2013 ). Fifth, awareness and know-how about water resource management in India is only catalysed by government in broad scale. Thus, government, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the public, together should take more proactive steps towards promotion and utilization of water resources to achieve sustainable development goals in water and sanitation (i.e. SDG 6) in India. Sixth, to control misutilization and overexploitation of water resources, especially in urban areas, regulatory instruments, such as - water utilization taxes, water recycling taxes etc. will remain a vital component of policies, as efforts to increase water efficiency and reduce environmental and socioeconomic impacts are usually unsupportable against a background of low-cost availability. Seventh, if consumers do not purchase devices with improved water use efficiency and environment characteristics (e.g. agricultural transport and household appliances etc.), when such devices are available commercially, these products should be supplemented by more direct government intervention and investment if advancement toward sustainable development in water resources are to be made. Eighth, since agriculture and household are two major water consuming sector in India, utilization of recycled and treated wastewater should be advocated. Ninth, since agricultural water withdrawal is highest in India among all other sectors, increasing agricultural water use efficiency should be highest priority through drip irrigation, hydroponics, urban terrace and rooftop agriculture, utilization of treated household wastewater in agriculture etc. Government of India has adopted six step strategies to achieve SDGs in India. These are – (1) mapping of ministries and programs, (2) identification of indicators, (3) consultations with stakeholders, (4) dovetailing the national development agenda with SDGs, (5) meticulous implementation of schemes aligned with SDG targets and (6) rigorous outcome-based monitoring (NITI Aayog, 2018a,b ). The main schemes or missions along with their concerned ministries/departments of Government of India, related to each target of SDG 6, are given in Supplementary Table. Water resources and its utilization are intimately connected to sustainable development of both water and sanitation. For Indian societies to attain sustainable development in water and sanitation, much effort must be devoted not only to discover sustainable ways to consume of water resources but also to increase the water use efficiencies (WUE) of processes utilizing water resources. Also, correlated environmental concerns must be addressed, (like – lower amount of water usage in agriculture should not cause any physiological stress in staple crops, precaution to any probable adverse effects of using genetically or biotechnologically modified crops for more water-efficient crops etc.) continuously monitored and any type or degree of declination must be solved. This proposed research framework would progress our current understanding and measurement of SDG 6. Through measurement and identification of how, when, and why changes in biophysical aspects of water and sanitation influence human socioeconomic conditions over both time and space and vice-versa, we can more fully appropriate and anticipate the impact of the bidirectional nature of human-water interactions. This understanding might also be used to monitor, update and refine the national SDG 6 framework. This would arm natural resource planning authorities with a decision support and policy management tool that more accurately reflects the trade-offs between various components of the SDG 6. As a final note, to make India water secure and sustainable and with improved sanitation access to all by 2030, India must endeavour to increase its efforts to attain greater efficiency in utilization, consumption of water and access to sanitation services for both biophysical and socioeconomic purposes.
