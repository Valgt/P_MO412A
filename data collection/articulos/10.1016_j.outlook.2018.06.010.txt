                  Background
                  In 2000, the United Nations (UN) introduced the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), described as a global movement with the primary aim of ending world-wide poverty (“Millennium Summit,” 2000). The second phase of the project, known as the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda offers an increased emphasis on lessening the mitigating factors associated with climate change and adapting to the negative effects of climate change. Nurses are in the unique position to address the health-related impacts related to climate change through community health approaches aimed at education and promotion of environmental stewardship.
               
                  Purpose
                  The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the relationships among the health consequences of climate change, nursing literature on climate change, and nursing implications. The following will be addressed: “What is nursing's role in policy, practice, and advocacy when addressing the effects of climate change? What is the importance of the SDGs as a framework for addressing climate change in the role of nursing?”
               
                  Method
                  This scoping review of the literature was conducted which included the evaluation of a broad range of articles using scoping methods as frameworks.
               
                  Findings
                  An overarching theme regarding the nursing community's responsibility in addressing the effects of climate change and their role as advocates, educators, and global citizens was extracted from the scoping review.
               
                  Discussion
                  There are many opportunities for nurses to become actively involved in efforts aimed at mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts in climate change, including becoming involved in policy, advocacy, research, and practice opportunities.

Discussion There are many opportunities for nurses to become actively involved in efforts aimed at mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts in climate change, including becoming involved in policy, advocacy, research, and practice opportunities.   Keywords Climate Change  Climate Justice  Climate Stewardship  Scoping Review  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals  Environmental Health    Background Climate change has been described as the greatest threat to public health this century by scientists steeped in the work of anthropogenic climate science (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, 2007d ; Goodman, 2013 ; Watts et al., 2015 ; Whitmee et al., 2015 ) and that the effects of climate change that exist today represent an “unacceptably high and potentially catastrophic risk to human health in this century” (Lancet Commission, 2015, p. 1,861). Increased carbon emissions result in the warming of our atmosphere and contribute to extreme fluctuations in weather as well as unhealthy conditions for both infectious diseases and chronic health conditions. The year 2017 was one of the warmest years on record characterized by warmer-than-average conditions across land and ocean surfaces globally. Record warmth was observed across nearly all continents and the global oceans had their third warmest year since global records began in 1880 (``Climate monitoring,'' n.d. ). The consequences to human health due to the changing climate include reduced air quality, punishing weather events, increased food insecurity, heat-related morbidity and mortality, increased violence, and mental health sequelae (Epstein, 2005 ). While resource-rich countries are contributing most to climate change, those living in resource-poor settings are often the most vulnerable and greatest affected, a concept known as climate (in)justice (Lemery, Williams, & Farmer, 2014; Shah, 2012 ). In 2009, the Human Rights Council reported on the detriments to basic human rights of the most defenseless that occur as a result of climate change including the right to food security, access to water, sanitation, housing, and health (Lemery et al., 2014 ). Our changing climate should be viewed not only as a threat to the environment, but also a humanitarian crisis and an issue of social justice (Sorensen & Lemery, 2015 ).  Nightingale, Climate Change, Environmental Health, and Nursing Since the issues of environmental health were first introduced by Florence Nightingale (1863), the importance of Nightingale's Environmental Theory and its current applicability to climate change and nursing's role in addressing climate change are critical to consider. According to Dossey and Beck (2013)  “We are that generation of 21st-century Nightingales and health diplomats” (p. 2), and nurses have a global responsibility to communicate her theory of environmental awareness and social action. Not only are nurses dealing with the consequences of the changing environment, Shaner-McRae, McRae, and Jas (2007)  report that nurses are currently contributing negatively to climate change through their actions at the bedside, likely without their knowledge. Nurses need to be aware of how they are disposing of medications, paper, and plastic products. They should be reminded of how much electricity and water they use when caring for patients. Proper recycling measures need to be used when disposing of different types of waste. Health care facilities need to assume an active role in mitigating the impacts of climate change throughout their organizations (Paterson et al., 2012) . The environmental health issues that can arise as a result of climate change are numerous including communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), and injuries directly related to weather-related events including hurricanes, flood surges, and wildfires. Vector-borne, water-borne, and food-borne illnesses are on the rise as a consequence of climate change, with the Zika virus being at the forefront of contemporary news. Climate change has been shown to cause and/or exacerbate chronic health illnesses, such as respiratory illnesses, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, stunted childhood development caused by nutritional deficiencies, and mental health disorders (Chalupka, 2014; Environmental Health Perspectives and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, 2010 ). Extreme weather events can result in heat-related mortality and injuries related to floods, fire, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes (Environmental Health Perspectives, 2010). Despite recent political challenges to the science on climate change, the evidence is undeniable that climate change is occurring, and that potential sequelae including negative health consequences will be devastating in this century and beyond.  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals On September 25th, 2015 to September 27th, 2015, the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Summit was held in New York City. It was there that the UN formally implemented the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), known in lay terms as the Global Goals , to be achieved by the year 2030 (“Sustainable Development Goals,” n.d.). The SDGs were developed to follow the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which were promulgated in the 2000 and aimed at eradicating global poverty. While only one of the SDGs (#3) focuses specifically on ensuring healthy lives and promoting overall well-being (``Sustainable Development Goals,'' n.d. ), there is an overarching theme woven throughout the new agenda that emphasizes the interrelationship between the social determinants of health and our environment. Ending poverty, promoting equity, and taking action against climate change all contribute to health on both individual and global levels (Becerra-Posada, 2015 ). Of note is that the SDGs explicitly identify climate change challenges as critical to planetary health and consequences for human health. The role of health care workers is vitally important to the success of the SDGs not only from a wellness perspective, but also in the context of advocating for human rights, encouraging policy change, and promoting environmental stewardship. de Francisco Shapavalova, Meguid, and Campbell (2015)  note that nurses should embrace the early scholarship of Florence Nightingale in optimizing the environment for wellness. As trusted and valued members of society, our health care community, nurses are in the unique position to use their collective voices to advocate for those affected by climate change, influence policy on climate change, and contribute to the success of the SDGs—particularly SDG 13 related to climate change and its implications for health. The knowledge and themes gleaned from this scoping review may serve as a basis for nursing implications for climate change. The 17 UN SDGs include the following: SDG 1: End Poverty in All Its Forms Everywhere; SDG 2: End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved Nutrition, and Promote Sustainable Agriculture; SDG 3: Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote Well-Being for All at All Ages; SDG 4: Ensure Inclusive and Equitable Quality Education and Promote Life-Long Learning Opportunities for All; SDG 5: Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls; SDG 6: Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All; SDG 7: Ensure Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable, and Modern Energy for All; SDG 8: Promote Sustained, Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth, Full and Productive Employment and Decent Work for All; SDG 9: Build Resilient Infrastructure, Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Industrialization and Foster Innovation; SDG 10: Reduce Inequality Within and Among Countries; SDG 11: Make Cities and Human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient and Sustainable; SDG #12: Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns; SDG #13: Take Urgent Action to Combat Climate Change and Its Impacts; SDG #14: Conserve and Sustainably Use the Oceans, Seas and Marine Resources for Sustainable Development; SDG 15: Protect, Restore and Promote Sustainable Use of Terrestrial Ecosystems, Sustainably Manage Forests, Combat Desertification, and Halt and Reverse Land Degradation and Halt Biodiversity Loss; SDG 16: Promote Peaceful and Inclusive Societies for Sustainable Development, Provide Access to Justice for All and Build Effective, Accountable and Inclusive Institutions at All Levels;  and SDG 17: Strengthen the Means of Implementation and Revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.  While only SDG 13 specifically addresses climate change, an overarching theme of sustainable living and responsible consumption is woven throughout the foundation of all the SDGs. Shaner-McRae et al. (2007)  report the need for nurses to become more aware of their clinical practice activities and routines. They suggest that through current practices, nurses are degrading the environment by improperly disposing of materials and misusing resources they may feel are abundant. Paterson et al. (2012)  note the importance of decreasing the impact that health care facilities have on carbon emissions. They offer strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation of current trends, as well as addressing approaches for climate resilience on climate change.  Methods A scoping review was chosen as the methodology for this paper to allow for an extensive evaluation of the breadth and depth of the available information on the connection between nursing and climate change. The framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005)  was used in conjunction with a more recently developed and detailed framework by Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien (2010) . Scoping reviews allow for the utilization of a variety of types of literature, regardless of the design. These types of reviews, also known as scoping studies, can serve as a method of information gathering prior to conducting a systematic review, or they can serve as their own entity to identify gaps in the literature, summarize outcomes, and/or create a set of guidelines (Levac et al., 2010 ). Stage 1: Identifying the Research Question The research question was revised during the development of the proposal. Initially, the focus was to evaluate the available literature on the methods used by nurses which contributed to the success of the MDGs and apply it to the SDGs with a primary focus on climate change. However, this phase uncovered a paucity of published material that specifically demonstrated nursing's influence on the MDGs. It was then determined that the role of nursing in relation to climate change would serve as the primary focus of this project with the SDGs as a framework to guide nursing practice in this arena. The intended outcome of this project is to engage members of the nursing community to increase their understanding of climate change, to provide education about the negative health consequences of climate change, and to offer direction on available mitigation and adaptation strategies. Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review is to examine the relationship between the health consequences of climate change and the role of nursing by answering the following questions: What is nursing's role in policy, practice, and advocacy when addressing the effects of climate change? What is the importance of the SDGs as a framework for addressing climate change and nursing?   Stage 2: Identifying Relevant Studies The scoping review requires an intensive and iterative process. The goals and search terms that were identified at the initiation of the project were altered and refined several times throughout its evolution causing a need to reformat the research questions. Initially, three separate searches using the following search terms were to be studied; “nursing and climate change”, “nursing and MDGs”, and “nursing and SDGs”, but it was determined that the best approach was to focus specifically on the “nursing and climate change” relationship. Relevant publications were identified using EBSCO/CINAHL, Ovid, and MEDLINE/PubMed using the search terms “nursing” and “climate change” were combined with the Boolean operator “AND” to isolate articles containing both search terms between the years 1996 and 2016. This search yielded a modest number of studies (n  = 79) from “grey literature” consisting mostly of professional communications from academic journals or periodicals. The search parameters were later expanded to include the years 1960 to 2016, but there were no relevant articles on nursing and climate change published prior to 1996. The initial results generated only one qualitative study and one quantitative study. However, several interviews, editorial responses to previously published articles, and trainings for nurses were found. Supplementary articles were obtained through internet searches on “Google Scholar,” “Google,” and “Yahoo” using the same search terms. Reference lists from each article were carefully reviewed, and resulted in additional technical reports, white papers, and government documents for the MDG and SDG background sections (Figure 1  ).  Stage 3: Study Selection All 79 articles from the “nursing and climate change” search were reviewed, either by abstract or in full, and 31 articles were excluded for the following reasons: did not address or demonstrate a relationship to climate change (n  = 7), duplicate articles (n  = 6), unable to obtain even after requesting (n  = 5), no relationship to nursing (n  = 4), scientific base with no connection to nursing (n  = 1), discussed future studies to be conducted (n  = 2), not available in English (n  = 2), based on continuing education units/ surveys to be completed (n  = 2), and content was insufficient (n  = 2). The articles were then analyzed by two members of the team, using the following charting system, with a third member providing assistance when a consensus could not be reached.  Stage 4: Charting the Data The remaining 48 articles were analyzed and plotted on an Excel spreadsheet, to determine their application of the following predetermined concepts; a background of climate change, the health consequences that can occur as a result, nursing knowledge or attitudes about climate change, mention of the MDGs, mention of the SDGs, mitigation strategies, adaptation strategies, a noted urgency in the document, a plan to address climate change effects, and encouraging nurses to speak out against climate change. After reviewing 17 articles, a theme of climate justice was noted throughout and was subsequently added to the list of criteria (Table 1  ). Mitigation strategies are defined as any actions that aim to control the progression of climate change (Thomas, 2014 ), such as working with hospital administrators to ensure that staff are aware of the important difference between medical waste and regular waste. Adaptation strategies are defined as methods used to manage the current state of the environment (Thomas, 2014 ), such as preparing our institutions for an influx of patients during a heatwave. Urgency was noted if the article contained any of the following terms related to climate change; “catastrophic,” “critical,” “vital,” “crisis,” “unprecedented,” “seriousness,” “threat,” “imperative,” “immediate,” or “crucial”.   Results Stage 5: Collating, Summarizing, and Reporting the Results Background of Climate Change In order for an article to meet the requirements of the “background of climate change” category it needed to reference the damage being done to the planet through anthropogenic (caused by humans) changes. It is interesting to note that only 75% (n  = 36) of the articles met this criterion. Without an understanding of the factors that contribute to the negative effects of the environment, understanding mitigation and adaptation strategies becomes more challenging for those in which the article was intended.  Health Consequences Eighty-one percent (n  = 39) of all articles discussed the potential “health consequences” that could occur as a result of climate change, some of which provided an ample amount of detail. As previously stated, climate change can exacerbate, or even cause, NCDs, communicable diseases, mental health issues, nutritional deficiencies, and complications from weather-related events (Environmental Health Perspectives, 2010). It is important for nurses to not only be well-informed about the science behind climate change, but also about the sequelae and ways it may affect their practice.  Nursing Knowledge and Attitudes Articles meeting the “nursing knowledge and attitudes” criterion assessed previous awareness, knowledge to be obtained through trainings or curriculum advances, and/or nurse's attitudes concerning the validity of climate change research. Sixty-nine percent (n  = 33) of the articles met this criterion. It was noted that many universities are creating sustainability-based curriculum plans in an effort to provide their students with the tools needed to recognize the influence climate change will have on their practice. Due to the fact that this is a burgeoning area of knowledge for most in the health care field, it is important that this education is also offered in health care institutions, both to introduce and refresh the knowledge of the staff.  Reference to MDGs and/or SDGs The most surprising finding noted throughout the article review was the lack of reference to the MDGs. Only one article (or 2%) addressed the MDGs, which was unexpected since the MDGs were largely about health and poverty, and there is an obvious association between the effects of climate change and the MDGs. The SDGs were not discussed in any of the 48 articles, but that may be due to the fact that they were only recently proposed in 2015, and many articles were published prior to that date.  Mitigation and/or Adaptation Strategies Ideas for mitigation (n  = 39) and adaptation (n  = 36) strategies were offered in the majority of articles, 81% and 75%, respectively. The criteria were not met if the publication merely contained the words “mitigation” or “adaptation”. Examples of practices that would support the approaches are recycling, decreasing carbon-emitting travel, proper handling of waste (mitigation), and developing policies and emergency preparedness plans, such as cooling centers (adaptation) (Anderko, Davies-Cole, & Strunk, 2014 ). These strategies will be discussed in further detail in relation to the implications for nursing.  Urgency A sense of “urgency” in the article proved to be the category for which the greatest amount of bias was represented. After completion of the article review, it was determined that a “sense of urgency” was too subjective and open to interpretation. The publications were then reevaluated to determine if they contained any of the following terms related to climate change; “catastrophic,” “critical,” “vital,” “crisis,” “unprecedented,” “seriousness,” “threat,” “imperative,” “immediate,” or “crucial” as previously stated. Seventy-five percent (n  = 36) of the articles contained at least one of the terms identified as pertaining to urgency. While this finding is promising, it also indicates that one-quarter of the articles did not express the serious nature of climate change and the potential deleterious effects on human health.  Plan Forty articles (or 83%) presented a suggested plan for nurses to address climate change through mitigation and/or adaptation strategies. Encouraging nurses to “speak out” by equipping them with the tools to educate patients and peers, create programs within their institutions, and lobby for changes in local laws were important features in the majority of the publications. This category was the most prominent concept noted throughout the review, mentioned in 88% (n  = 42) of the articles. Promoting nursing involvement through the various forms of communication was even more visible than a straightforward background synopsis or the mention of the health consequences related to climate change, perhaps demonstrating the importance of a nursing presence in the community.  Climate Justice Many articles commented on the most vulnerable population (children, elderly, homeless, and immunocompromised) being the most greatly affected—suggesting the importance of a focus on social justice or climate justice. However, the criterion for “climate justice” was not met unless the publication specifically mentioned that those who contribute the least to the destruction of the environment are likely the ones who will be experiencing the greatest amount of suffering. As previously stated, this classification was not added until a theme of climate justice emerged over the course of the evaluation. All publications were then reanalyzed, and a total of 13 articles (or 27%) discussed the concept of climate justice. A fundamental theme in the practice of nursing is to view each person using a holistic approach. Understanding the concept of climate justice provides the nurse with a broader view of the interrelationships between people and the environment and provides a foundation for nurses to play a greater role in the advocacy of the underserved.   Themes Several recurring themes emerged from the literature review, all consisting of some reference to nursing education. The importance of integrating a sustainability curriculum into nursing programs and health care institutions was at the forefront. In addition to formal training, educating nurses on ways to mitigate the effects of climate change in their institutions, while providing them with the skills they need to educate others, resulted in an overarching theme noted throughout the review. Finally, while a paucity of research studies was noted, in 2007 and 2008, there was a push by the American Nurses Association (ANA) to encourage nurses to become aware of the changing environment, which gave rise to a subsequent increase in published articles regarding the connection between nursing and climate change. Nursing Education The importance of incorporating sustainability programs into both undergraduate and graduate curricula was well represented, with learning continuing throughout one's practice. Anaker, Nilsson, Holmer, and Elf (2015)  conducted a qualitative study on the attitudes of nurses regarding their perceived impact on climate change and mitigation strategies. They found that the studied population felt that if they were to make changes in their methods of practice, from a reactive style to a more proactive style, the overall benefits to the planet would be largely insignificant. Even though a large number of the nurses in the group claimed to recycle at home, few reported continuing those efforts in their workplace.  Responsibility of Health Care Institutions After the food industry, health care institutions consume the second largest amount of energy on the planet (Thomas, 2014 ). This has implications for nurses to educate themselves, their patients, and their peers on strategies to correct this situation and will be further detailed in the nursing implications section. Nurses are employed in various settings throughout the community and are poised to use their voice to inform others, especially because they are regarded as such a trusted profession (Thomas, 2014 ).  Paucity of studies Research studies, but qualitative and quantitative, were poorly represented in the literature and are needed to further understand the knowledge and attitudes of nurses regarding climate change, sustainability, and nursing. Upon conducting the search, it was noted that there were few documents on nursing and climate change, regardless of methodology, published between the years 1996 and 2006. Subsequently, in the year 2007, there was an influx of reports, technical papers, editorials, and announcements regarding the significance of climate change to the field of nursing and the implications behind it. After researching the possible reasons behind this pivotal shift, it was determined that the impetus was the unprecedented resolution passed by the ANA (Patton, 2008 ). In 2008, Rebecca Patton (p. 16), the ANA President, and, Penelope Seiple, Delaware Nurses Association President, resolved to tackle the issue of climate change. They submitted an action report detailing the background behind climate change and the potential health conditions that may occur as a result. That same year the following resolution was passed by the ANA 2008 House of Delegates (Condon, 2008 ). The ANA will:Recognize and publically acknowledge that the challenges we face as a result of global climate change are unprecedented in human history and it is critical that nurses speak out in a unified voice and advocate for change on both individual and policy levels;  Encourage constituent member associations to support local public policies that endorse sustainable energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and  Support initiatives to decrease the contribution to global warming by the health care industry (Condon, 2008, p. 12).     Nursing Organization Response Individual states responded with articles in state nursing journals, in addition to, publications and editorials written by individuals. Unfortunately, because this occurred in 2007/2008, the consequences surrounding climate change were not fully appreciated by the nursing community until the MDGs were over half-way through their 15-year plan. Interestingly, the number of relevant articles published in 2015 was greater than twice that of the year before or in any of the previous years (Figure 2  ). Since this scoping review was completed, the growth in numbers of manuscripts published regarding climate change and nursing has increased dramatically. This noteworthy change is likely due in part to the promulgation of the SDGs by the UN with an amplified focus on climate change, even though SDGs were not directly mentioned in the articles. The nursing community recognized the call to action, resulting in a deliberate increase of published literature on nursing's role in addressing the effects of climate change.   Current State of Climate Change and Nursing Since this scoping review was completed, there has been an increase in published articles in the nursing literature including an edition of the Journal of Nursing Scholarship  which included manuscripts on the health consequences of climate change. The edition included papers on planetary health, farmworker vulnerability, disaster issues such as the problems resulting from Hurricane Sandy, climate justice, and nursing's mandate to address climate change in nursing curricula (Figure 2 ).   Implications for Nursing Nurses in Policy and Advocacy Efforts Nurses have the critical opportunity to engage in policy and advocacy efforts related to climate change—and mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts. Notably, nursing organizations including the Canadian Nurses Association have taken a leading role in addressing climate change from a policy perspective. Among the key initiatives that have been addressed are specific efforts to engage nurses in governmental efforts and nongovernmental organizations, as well as to support and embrace the key messages on health and climate change. As the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate change  report (2017) suggests, there are key messages that nurses should share with interprofessional, professional, and student constituencies:• The human symptoms of climate change are unequivocal and potentially irreversible-affecting the health of populations around the world today.  • The delayed response to climate change over the past 25 years has jeopardized human life and livelihoods.  • The voice of the health profession[s] is essential in driving forward progress on climate change and realizing the health benefits of this response.  • Although progress has been historically slow, the past 5 years have seen an accelerated response, and in 2017, momentum is building across a number of sectors; the direction of travel is set, with clear and unprecedented opportunities for public health.    As noted in this Lancet (2017) report: Following the US government's announced intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the global community has demonstrated overwhelming support for enhanced action on climate change, affirming clear political will and ambition to reach the treaty's targets. The mitigation and adaptation interventions committed to under the Paris Agreement have very positive short-term and long-term health benefits, but greater ambition is now essential (p. 2). Nursing Efforts at the Local Level . Nurses have the opportunity to impact change in their institutions by ensuring that there is efficient utilization of resources. This may involve the practice of turning off the lights in unoccupied rooms, or shutting down computers and other electronic equipment that is not in use. According to Barna, Goodman, and Mortimer (2012) , nurses have the responsibility to ask themselves, “Can we use less? Can it be reused? Can it be recycled?” (p. 768). Locally, nurses can encourage the use of low-flow water faucets and spouts in their institutions. Nurses may also act by rejecting the purchase and use of bottled water by opting for tap water, or in the case of immunocompromised patients, filtered water (Sayre, 2010) . These values should be carried over to their personal lives in addition to their places of work. Of equal importance is the practice of encouraging nursing awareness of the most climate-friendly methods of disposal. The difference in price between regular waste ($53/ton) and medical waste ($552/ton) is likely not well understood by those working in hospital environments (Thomas, 2014 ). Some unsoiled medical devices that would have been previously thrown away without concern, could be reused for trainings, thus saving money and reducing impact on the environment. It is important that hospital administrators understand the benefits of changing their practice to promote a positive impact on the environment and better their reputation in the community, with the added benefit of financial savings (Thomas, 2014 ). Nurses should create “green teams” or other sustainability programs within their communities or institutions. They can request involvement from their local politicians and hospital administrators. Having a stake in the activities of their communities and the organizations in which they work creates a more meaningful experience. Neira (2015)  suggests that health care workers can make a difference in their communities by working with urban planners to design cities with more opportunities for walking, promoting health decreasing emissions caused by driving. Nurses can partner with local decision makers to assess those at greatest risk for the consequences of climate change, either by physiological status, socio-economic status, physical location, or a combination of these. Nurses can also act by creating emergency preparedness response plans for those individuals and/or settings and by performing continuous monitoring of risks to the health of the population. Nurses’ efforts in educating patients who may be at greatest risk for heat- or cold-related weather events, poor air quality situations, and the incidence of vector-borne, water-borne, or food-borne threats. This can be accomplished by means of visual media, phone calls, and/or posters, as well as media campaigns (Sayre, 2010) . It is critical to have the skills to recognize and prepare institutions for increased nursing demand during those situations. The nursing voice is an important part of the community, and it should be used to advocate and participate in the development of stronger policies to decrease the deleterious impact on the environment.  Nursing Efforts in Patient Care Undoubtedly, nurses will witness the consequences that climate change will have on their patients, either by direct effects such as extreme weather-related disasters and an increase in vector-borne diseases, or by indirect effects such as nutritional deficiencies, NCDs, and mental illness brought about from mass migration (Barna et al., 2012 ). An understanding of the ways to mitigate and adapt to climate change will allow nurses to educate others, both their peers and their patients, and will result in improved health outcomes overall. Education is paramount for understanding and overcoming most of the challenges we face in life. Equipping others with the foundation upon which to adapt and thrive is an incredibly valuable gift that nurses are adept at providing. It is critical for nurses to educate their patients about nutrition and the many benefits of making healthy lifestyle changes. By encouraging them to eat locally-sourced foods, such as fruits and vegetables, and reduce their consumption of animal products, they are no longer contributing to the massive carbon emissions that result from the transit required to stock grocery stores and produce processed foods, while also providing their bodies with essential nutrients. However, when instructing patients about the importance of a healthy diet, it is important that nurses understand their patient population. Goodman (2015)  notes that it may be difficult to insist that families with low socio-economic status make healthy choices over processed foods. In fact, they may have few other options. This is also true in global locations where salt water intrusion on island nations leaves populations dependent on imported food products that may be less healthy. However, these situations should be addressed for opportunities to develop creative solutions with these populations.  Nurses as Global Citizens The responsibility to practice a sustainable lifestyle lies with each individual and nurses have the opportunity to lead by example from an individual as well as a population health perspective. Recycling/composting, eating locally-sourced foods, opting to print/copy on both sides of paper, choosing tap water over bottled, and rejecting long-distance travel are a few examples suggested by Goodman (2013) . In addition, electing to use alternate methods of transportation, such as walking or biking, will result in reduced carbon emissions, fewer automobile accidents, and improved air quality, all while experiencing the many health benefits of exercise (Barna et al., 2012 ). Educating and encouraging others to do the same is also important, but it is vital that they understand the reasons behind these changes. The Canadian Nurses Association has taken a leading role in addressing the role of nurses as global citizens and ambassadors for climate change. Nurses should become familiar with the role of global citizenship . This addresses the concept that health is not simply a result of our local environmental health stressors, but is affected by socio-economic factors, inequality, and climate change (Goodman, 2013 ).  Nursing Education The discussion of climate change should be infused in nursing curricula from baccalaureate to doctoral levels of education. In the Richardson et al. (2014)  article, the authors describe the sustainability program offered to students at Plymouth University in the United Kingdom. They have developed evidence-based scenarios that increase nurses’ understanding about the ways in which their available resources are produced, transported, used, and disposal methods in order to create more sustainability conscious members in the health care field. The authors found that while there initially was skepticism regarding the program, particularly regarding the relationship between climate change and nursing practice, the skills sessions have since become enthusiastically accepted by both students and academic colleagues. Further Richardson, Grose et al. (2015) have addressed the importance of nursing students’ views on sustainability in health care amidst the landscape of climate change. Goodman (2011)  urges educators to develop similar programs in their institutions in The Need for a  “Sustainability Curriculum ” in Nurse Education . He discusses the importance of linking the concepts of health, climate change, and sustainability and engaging nursing students in the efforts to limit the negative health effects of climate change. Focusing primarily on biomedical skills acquisition and ignoring the link between those three concepts puts future nurses, and ultimately the planet, at a great disadvantage. Goodman encourages educators to incorporate various teaching modalities throughout the curriculum including skills sessions, immersion in natural environments, and interspersed sustainability course offerings. Maxwell and Blashki (2016)  suggest that there is a strong case for teaching about climate change in medical education, and we would suggest nursing education as well. Integrating climate change knowledge in health professions curricula and postprofessional education is an urgent need in the United States and globally. Key areas to include are the ways in which climate change affects health including immediate and direct risks, indirect risks, deferred and diffuse risks, and risks associated with conflict and refugee flows. Immediate and direct risks  include heatwaves and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and altered air quality leading to respiratory and cardiac issues. Indirect risks are characterized by changes to ecosystems and biophysical systems affecting infectious disease, crop yields, fish stocks, water quality and aeroallergens. Deferred and diffuse risks  relate to mental and physical health with extreme weather events leading to stress and trauma, anxiety, and depression (Maxwell & Blashki, 2016; McMichael, Montgomery, & Costello, 2012 ).  Nurses as Advocates for Climate Justice Nurses need to be able to recognize and understand the concept of climate justice and ways in which those in developed countries continue to harm the impoverished. Climate change has been shown to have a directly negative effect on those living in poverty, whether it is due to the health consequences associated with overcrowding, lack of potable water, diminished crops, or mass migration (“Climate change complicates efforts to end poverty,” 2015 ). Promoting the development of strong infrastructure to aid citizens before they become impoverished is one way nurses can support those who are at greatest risk. Nurses should strive to become what Goodman (2013)  describes as global reformers , individuals with a solid understanding of social injustices. They are able to minimize their carbon footprint and educate others to follow, based on the climate justice philosophy. This topic can also be viewed from a local nursing perspective, striving to eliminate inequality in our institutions and communities. Limited access to resources, resulting from climate change, may lead to social inequalities (p. 50). It is important that the nursing community understands this concept and strives to create a shift in knowledge about the risks to the social determinants of health of the most vulnerable. For example, climate change is creating water paucity and therefore affects access to potable water. Girls and their mothers are largely responsible for obtaining the family's water supply in developing countries. This process can take several hours, resulting in time spent away from the classroom, thus affecting their education. A Tanzanian study evaluated school attendance based upon its distance from the closest clean water source. The study concluded that attendance increased by 12% when water was available within a 15 min walk compared to greater than 30 min (``Gender and water, sanitation and hygiene,'' 2016 ). Nurses do not have to travel to a developing country to aid in the delivery of clean water or increased time spent in the classroom. In addition to minimizing their impact on the environment, they can raise awareness and funds to enhance access to clean water. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated a rise in sea levels of between two and six feet over the next three generations, which will adversely affect one-tenth of the population living in coastal communities. There are not only concerns about the flooding and displacement that will occur as a result, but also saltwater intrusion affecting freshwater sources (as recently seen in the Marshall Islands), which will affect potable water availability and agricultural practices (Sayre, 2010) . It is critical for nurses to be able to recognize the hazards that disruption to the marine ecosystems can have on humans and also to work toward mitigating these factors through the creation of global citizen  and global reformer  mentalities.   Implications for Further Research Although Nightingale's Environmental Theory emphasized the importance of clean air, water, and light in our environment, exploring the contributions of nursing in addressing climate change are relatively novel. As a result, there have been a limited number of studies conducted, paving the way for a large body of previously unexplored research. A quantitative study on the potential financial savings that occur as a result of proper nursing education, improved waste disposal, and the creation of “green teams” would likely be of interest to health care institutions worldwide. Another focus for qualitative or quantitative research could be conducted related to the difference in nursing behaviors relative to the level of sustainability and its relationship to climate change training received in their nursing education. Also needed is an exploration of the level of knowledge of faculty and students related to climate change and health consequences. The opportunities for climate change research are vast, as this is a burgeoning area of interest, particularly in the field of nursing.  Conclusion Nightingale introduced the nursing profession to the importance of clean air, potable water, and a healthy environment as vital factors in the healing process, as well as necessary dynamics for maintaining health on a holistic level (Nightingale, 1969) . These factors may seem clear to nurses in the 21st century, but these key elements are being threatened by the changing climate. This review assessed the literature that focuses on the nursing profession's unique responsibility pertaining to the climate change crisis. The results of this review have uncovered gaps in the literature regarding the relationship between nursing and climate change; however, there is an ample amount of published literature to launch future study of the negative health sequelae of climate change. Encouraging policy change, promoting education, advocating for the underserved, and practicing responsibly are key areas for further investigation. As nurses, we have the responsibility to lead by example and educate our patients on ways to best care for themselves and their communities, while reducing our impact on the planet.
