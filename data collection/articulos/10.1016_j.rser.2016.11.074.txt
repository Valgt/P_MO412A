                  Driven by the desire to mitigate climate change and reduce overdependence on fossil fuels, biofuels have been actively pursued in recent years because they are believed to be inherently environmentally friendly. In the past few years, however, critics have objected to the basis for which it should be adopted due to potential negative trade-offs. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) number seven seeks to substantially increase contribution of renewable energy to global energy supply, as well as double the rate of improvement in efficiency of energy. Biofuels are likely to play a key role in the pursuit of these goals being one of the most advanced alternative energy sources. This review assesses the potential of biofuels to contribute to the set SDGs by presenting an appraisal of their development over the years. It sheds light on some main arguments surrounding biofuels from the perspective of proponents and critics alike. Even though biofuels have a great potential in aiding climate change mitigation, its large scale adoption is regarded as problematic in its current state. This is because of its potential negative trade-offs in terms of land use change and emissions, especially for first and second generation biofuels. However, a combination of plant biology, carbon capture techniques and novel bioconversion processes provided by third and fourth generation biofuel technologies have set open an era of fuels that will be abundant, energy efficient and clean to support the seventh SDG.

Keywords Biofuels  Synthetic biology  System biology  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction 1.1 The Issue of Biofuel- Its rise, necessity and prospects for the future The world population is continuously growing since the last 50 years, resulting in a large increase in primary energy consumption. In 2010, world primary energy consumption grew by 5.6%, which is the largest percentage growth in almost 40 years [1] . Hence, the world is currently facing two major challenges, which are energy crisis and environmental pollution [2] . With a growing recognition of this dual challenge, the world has formally enshrined the pursuit of renewable energy targets in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to meet the growing demand for energy and curb pollution [18] . Global energy crisis in the past decades has been attributed to the substantial decrease in fossil fuel deposits and volatility in world prices. Extensive use of fossil fuel for power generation and transportation fuel has caused high carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions into the atmosphere and there is an urgent need to reduce its emission to avoid harmful impacts of global warming. In its starkest report yet, the fifth assessment report (AR5) of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published in 2014 suggested that fossil fuels must completely be phased out by 2100 [3] . Currently, the report indicates that renewable energy makes up about 30% of global energy supply and should increase to at least 80% by 2050 if the 2100 target is to be reached. Previous studies conducted by Shell International Petroleum Company indicated that biofuel will be a major supplier of energy after 2020. Furthermore, detailed analyses have suggested that it will contribute to future energy production more than all other renewable energy sources combined [4–7] . Historically, biomass has always been a very important source of energy for households, especially in developing countries. In recent years, however, its use has steadily increased in developed countries such as Sweden, Austria, Denmark, USA, Finland, and UK among others [5,7–9] . Havlík, Schneider [10]  have stated that the interest in developing biofuel first arose in after the oil crisis in the 1970's and now, the declining cost of production due to subsidies provided by national governments, and the continued swelling up of oil prices are contributing to its competitiveness. Currently, renewable energy is said to be more subsidized than fossil fuels globally, with the exception of China. In Europe and Australia, the biofuel industry is said to enjoy substantial excise tax rebates and exemptions [106,107,109,110] . As a matter of fact, in Australia, the biofuel industry had an effective rate of assistance (ERA) of 100% or more by 2006; far greater than agriculture and manufacturing which averaged around 5% in 2006/2007 [106] . In Canada, subsidies on a litre of ethanol from corn to substitute an equivalent litre of fossil energy is also said to be enough to purchase a litre of the displaced fuel [108] . Several advanced countries continue to set very ambitious targets for themselves as far as biofuel development is concerned. In the United States (US), it is mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act in 2007 to produce over 36 billion gallons of biofuel by 2022 [11–13] . In the European Union (EU), to achieve a target of reducing GHG emissions by 20% in 2020 compared to 1990 levels, it is a goal to increase the share of renewables in the EU's final energy consumption to 20% with a 10% share of biofuels expected in member states [11,13] . Between 2000 and 2007, biofuel production more than tripled around the globe from a little below five billion gallons to about 16 billion gallons, primarily from food crops [14,15] . As illustrated in  Fig. 1 , the biofuel production in the world has been rising steadily with the major contributors being US and Brazil [56] . Advocacy for renewable energy has always been deeply rooted in the fact that they are ‘green’ and therefore may serve as a low-carbon source for future energy needs. The qualities biofuels share with fossil fuels have, however, through studies been shown not to be limited to that stated above but also a tendency for air emissions especially at its conversion state. There have been several debates with proponents and critics on two ends of the spectrum about the grounds on which biofuel is to be adopted. This debate is likely to intensify as the world has formally transitioned from the era of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) era with specific targets for renewable energy development. Including renewable energy targets in the SDGs is especially critical because while the MDGs acknowledged the need for reliable energy supply to meet global goals, it did not emphasize specific targets of renewable energy in the global energy mix. In the SDGs, however, the need to employ sustainable and renewable energy sources to achieve global goals has been illuminated in goal number seven. Some specific targets within SDG number seven are as follows: to substantially increase the share of renewable energy to global energy mix by 2030; to double the rate of improvement of energy efficiency around the globe; and to increase supply of modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries through infrastructure expansion and technology upgrade [18] . Biofuels, being the most advanced alternate source of energy, will be expected to play a key role in the pursuit of these goals. However, if biofuels are expected to be pivotal in the pursuit of SDG renewable energy targets in phasing out fossil fuels mainly on the grounds of its environmental friendliness, then it is only prudent to assess how it fully merits its consideration. This paper aims to present a critical appraisal of biofuels, assessing arguments from the perspectives of both proponents and critics, on two sides of the spectrum. That is how large scale adoption of biofuels may affect environmental quality and land use changes, and how advanced biofuel technology will affect the concepts and prospects of future energy production. The review also proffers recommendations towards achieving the set SDG targets. The paper is structured as follows; after this introductory section is a brief description of the various types of biofuels. The third section considers arguments for and against the large scale and long term adoption of first and second generation biofuels as primary global fuel. General overview of third generation biofuels is also presented, with focus on how progress of microalgae-based biofuels is impacting the dynamics of biofuel debate. An overview of progress with fourth generation biofuels ends the third section. The fourth section is a brief summary of issues in the preceding sections. Finally, the paper ends with recommendations for policy and priority research areas necessary for achieving the set SDGs.   2 Types of biofuels Biofuels can be produced via various renewable feedstocks such as edible oil (e.g. palm oil), non-edible oil (e.g. jatropha) and lignocellulosic biomass (e.g. wood). Biofuels are currently driven by biological material from plants, microorganisms, animals and wastes. Different feedstocks are utilized by different countries and regions for the production of biofuels ( Fig. 2 ). Biofuels depend on the photosynthetic conversion of solar energy to chemical energy. In fact, the line between renewable biofuels and non-renewable fossil fuels is sometimes unclear as the source of biofuel feedstock can have a significant impact on the debate surrounding biofuels. Therefore, only complete life-cycle analyses can reveal which feedstock is more sustainable and environmentally friendly for biofuel production [19] . Based on the source and production technology, biofuels are classified into the first, second, third [20]  and the fourth generation biofuels ( Fig. 3 ). Brief descriptions of the four categories of biofuels are presented below. 2.1 First generation biofuels Biofuels obtained from technologies that make use of the conversion of feedstock such as sugar and starch portions of sugarcane, cassava and sugar beet cereals into ethanol are classified under first generation biofuels. Belonging to this category are also biofuels obtained from technologies that utilize oil-seed crops such as rapeseed, sunflower, soybean and palm oil [30] . These forms of biofuels have reached the most advanced forms in biofuel production and are commercially available. As a matter of fact, oil palm and sugarcane is said to account for more than 90% of total biofuel feedstock investments in tropical countries since the year 2000 [46] .  2.2 Second generation biofuels Second generation biofeuel technologies utilize more flexible and energy-efficient lignocellulosic feedstock such as biomass from agricultural and forest residues as well as feedstock such as trees, jatropha, straw, bagasse, and purpose energy crops grown on marginal lands [12,15,18,30] . These feedstocks are converted into ethanol and methanol [12] . Unlike the first generation biofuels, this type of biofuels do not only utilize the grains, sugars or fats but the entire plant which means energy yields per hectare of land can be much higher [15] .  2.3 Third generation biofuels The third generation biofuels are based on improvements in biomass production as the algae and other feedstock primarily utilized as its energy source are specially engineered through advanced biotechnology [11,15,21–23] . According to Chisti [21] , the algae are cultured to act as high-energy and entirely renewable feedstock produced at low cost. Algae are predicted to have the potential to produce more energy per acre of land than can be produced by conventional crops like corn and sugarcane. However, they are limited in commercial availability and are currently under broad research.  2.4 Fourth generation biofuels The fourth generation biofuels are expected to bring essential advances in the biofuels field [24,25] . They are seen as carbon negative rather than just carbon neutral through the capture and storage of carbon [25] . This technology is an emerging field based on direct conversion of solar energy into fuel using raw materials. Revolutionary developments in synthetic and system biology approaches will be vital for further development.   3 The biofuel debate 3.1 Pros and Cons of the first and second generation biofuel production There have been many concerns raised about plans to expand biofuel production and the potential negative implications of some set targets by countries such US, China, Brazil and the European Union [26,27] . This section of the paper focuses on the debate about biofuels both from the point of view of proponents and critics. It is, however, noteworthy that the arguments in this section pivots around the first and second generation biofuels which are currently the most commercially available. The subsequent section is dedicated to assessing the impact of third generation biofuels, particularly microalgae-based biofuels on the dynamics of the biofuel debate, and followed by the fourth generation biofuels. 3.1.1 Deforestation, land tenure and food security One phase of the biofuel debate deals with its potential impacts on deforestation in the tropics, land uses and food production. Though Hall and Scrase [5]  concedes to the fact that expanding biofuel production will involve substantive amount of energy cropping, it anticipated there will be little to no interference with food production or existing land uses. They stated that the world could meet 80% of its energy needs from biofuel plantations and 10% from residues, while still producing enough food. As referenced in Hall and Scrase [5] , Friends of the Earth predicted that about 42 million hectares (M ha) of land could be available in Europe after 2010 for non-food production. This estimate meant that there would be availability of a vast expanse of land to be dedicated solely to energy crop production, which would prevent interference with food production. On the other hand, some researchers view biofuel development as with both direct and indirect impacts on land uses and land tenure, as well as having the potential to change the focus of the agricultural sector as a whole [28–31] . An extensive study by Gao, Skutsch [26]  tried to assess the spatial linkage between biofuel and deforestation but was unable to find any clear linkage. It, however, indicated that rising biofuel hotspots are usually found in the tropical areas. The US increases its production of ethanol and has dedicated over 12 M ha of land into production of biofuels and it is estimated that the constant expansion will induce another 10 M ha of land clearance in the tropical areas. Some studies have indicated that the aggressive investments associated with large-scale biofuel developments have displaced informal and poor tenure holders through land grabs which either increases further exploitation of pristine lands or hunger [32,33] . In the amazon, Scarlat and Dallemand [34]  stated that “corn-connection” and expansion of soybean farms for biofuel have had a great indirect impact on deforestation and land uses as these expansions are displacing cattle ranchers further deeply into the amazon. For example, it has been reported that due to take over of lands by biofuel plantations which had resulted in spread of cropland and pasture caused the destruction of about 750,000 acres of rain forest in Brazil in just the last half of 2007 [15] . In Ghana and Mexico, it has also been observed that households without formal land titles lost access to land jatropha plantation projects [33,35] . Research focused on biofuel development in the global South and several other tropical countries has indicated a demonstration of “boom crops” effect associated with biofuel crops [28] . This phenomenon, they argue, will have a direct effect on national and local food security as current expansion of biofuel crops trends in the production of other cash crops. In Guatemala, it is said that there is an on-going large scale diversion of scarce crop lands from food production to oil palm plantation due to the huge demand from biofuels [28] . Bonin and Lal [11]  recognizes same phenomenon as underway in the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia and Indonesia where there is currently a continually increasing vast plantations of palm oil to feed biofuel production. In these countries palm oil producers are accused of “land grabs” which is forcing out indigenous communities as well as inducing deforestation [11,12] . Contrary to predictions by Hall and Scrase [5] , most researchers including the Economist and International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) have attributed the increase in food prices in 2008, which pushed more than 100 million (M) people below the poverty line, to increase in biofuel production [15,28,36,37] . As explained by Malik, Ahmed [29]  and Senauer [15] , while food price increases have normally been supply-driven as a result of poor harvests in one or more leading producer countries, the hike in food prices in 2007 was demand-driven. This conclusion is logical since 2007 registered a record harvest of over 2.3 billion tons of grain. According to Senauer [15] , the US doubled its ethanol production between 2004 and 2007 and actually removed about 2.3 billion bushels of corn from the global food supply which explains the increase in food prices despite record harvest of grains. Previously, it had been projected that the number of people affected by chronic hunger which stood at 820 M people between 2001 and 2003 will decrease to 625 M people by 2025 provided food prices remained stable and global economic and population growth were as predicted. However, some authors currently predict that if the price of food should be affected to the same order of magnitude by biofuels, the number of food insecure people in developing countries will rather increase to about 1.2 billion by 2025 [15] .  3.1.2 Emissions of Green House Gases (GHGs) and climate change The main reason behind suggestion of biofuel adoption has been the fear of climate change and how it can help to reduce emissions. When operating at a steady state, biomass energy is regarded as carbon neutral, as there carbon emissions as a result of biomass combustion is balanced out by carbon fixation during biomass growth [38] . However, some researchers strongly contest the basis for this proposition as it is regarded as overly simplistic. As some studies have shown the ability of biofuel to reduce the amount of GHGs, others have opposed this claim. Critics argue that this reduction of GHGs as stated have not taken into consideration the entire life cycle of biofuels, ignoring emissions that would take place as a result land use changes [26,27] . Whether forests left standing to serve as carbon sinks or using their biomass for biofuels will produce the better returns as long as reduction in GHGs is concerned has been part of the contentious debate. Annually, fossil fuel combustion and land use change emit approximately 6.7 and 1.6 petagram of carbon (Pg C) respectively [7,26] . Kyoto Convention on Climate Change recommended some management options of forests to conserve and sequester about 90 Pg C in the next century through global afforestation. As some scientists perceive keeping forest stands in perpetuity will be the best in this sense, proponents point out that as forests reach maturity, it diminishes in its ability to sequester carbon [7,26] . Proponents also argue that if forests are disturbed by natural disturbances like wildfires, the amount of effect will be higher than if there was no forest sinks in the first place. It is also suggested by proponents that having biofuel plantations will contribute in on-going sequestration while substituting fossil fuel after harvest. A fossil fuel substitution efficiency of 50% is said to have the same capacity as using forest kept in perpetuity [7] . Critics have countered by estimating that land conversion for biofuel plantations causes between 50–70% of initial carbon stock losses resulting in a large carbon debt [11] . This assertion is corroborated by Schmer, Jin [39] . They utilized life cycle assessment to evaluate total contribution of biofuels to GHG emissions considering subsurface soil organic carbon changes. Schmer, Jin [39]  found that there was as much as 154% underestimation of GHG emission values when near-surface soil organic carbon stock exchanges are considered and subsurface exchanges are ignored. Apart from this direct loss, opponents argue that there is an additional carbon debt unaccounted for as indirect emissions occurring as a result of ecosystems displacement or additional land conversion due to bioenergy crops expansion are being currently underestimated by as much as 140% [11,15,40] . Expanding biofuel production will mean using more fertilizers to boost production of biomass such as corn and this will increase nitrous oxide gas (N2 O), a very potent GHG, which could have a negative return on the climate change mitigation. As a matter of fact, Senauer [15]  has stated that instead of an expected decrease of 20% in GHG emissions from biofuels, land use change and fertilizer application that accompanies energy cropping will rather double emissions over the next 30 years. Several modelling studies have been conducted to predict the impact of biofuels on future emissions [38,41–47] . These studies have produced mixed results, and revealed even more nuances as far as the biofuel-climate mitigating discourse is concerned [41,44] . These studies have shown factors such as feedstock choices, even within those that belong to the same generation; processing technology; capacity of plants; scale of development; rate of deployment; and sectors of deployment would result in very different outcomes [46,48] . Lapola, Schaldach [43]  is one of the quintessential studies that demonstrated the differences in impacts by different feedstocks, even those within the same generation. In this study, a spatially explicit model was utilized to analyze the likely net debts or benefit of biofuel targets set by the Brazilian government by the year 2020 in terms of climate change mitigation. This study estimated the impacts of different feedstocks, primarily sugarcane and soybean. Based on study simulations, soybean would require almost twice the amount of land that would be required for sugarcane to meet the same target. In terms of GHG emissions, the direct land use change (DLUC) of sugarcane ethanol utilization instead of fossil fuels will create carbon debt which would require four years to pay back. In the same breadth, soybean induced DLUC carbon emissions would require 35 years to pay back [43] . With indirect land use change (ILUC) taken into consideration, results from model simulations revealed that sugarcane ethanol and soybean diesel each account for almost half of the projected indirect deforestation. Carbon debt created as a result of ILUC would take 250 years to pay back. Testing the viability of other feedstocks to meet the biodiesel target, considering best returns in terms of GHG emissions, oil palm was found to have the best potential to cause the least land use change and its concomitant carbon debt [43] . A study by Gustavsson, Haus [42]  also analyzed the potential impact the sector of deployment of biofuels could have on efficiency in terms of climate mitigation potential. In this study, the climate implications of two main scenarios are compared. First, using bioenergy systems based on forest residues in electricity, heat, and transportation sectors. In the second scenario, fossil based energy systems are deployed in the aforementioned sectors while forest residues are left to decompose. In this study, cumulative radiative forcing (CRF) over a 300 year period is estimated for each scenario. Results of the study suggested that greater climate change mitigation benefits is achieved when fossil coal is substituted with biomass fuel than when it replaces fossil gas or oil. It was also found that it was inefficient to replace diesel with motor fuels produced from biomass. The study concluded that a scenario in which fossil fuels, such as diesel, remained in use for transportation while biomass energy replaces fossil gas and oil in generation of heat and electricity has the best returns in terms of climate change mitigation potential. Similar results were obtained in a study by Ilic, Dotzauer [48] . In this study, the impact of integrating large scale biofuel production into the Stockholm's transport and district heating sector on global GHG emissions is analyzed for the year 2030. The reference scenario used in the modelling study was that all new plants introduced into the district heating sector are traditional heat and power plants, with the biofuel share in the transport sector remaining constant in relation to today's level. One of the main findings in this study was that in the case where large scale biofuel production is introduced into the district heating system, reduction in GHG emissions is only significant when biomass is presented as an unlimited resource. However, when biomass is considered as a limited resource, as it really is, there is no recognizable benefit in terms of GHG emissions. Considering biomass as a limited resource, as in the case of Gustavsson, Haus [42] , different outcomes in terms of climate mitigating potential were obtained depending on the alternative uses of biomass energy.  3.1.3 Air quality Fuel combustion is inherently accompanied by characteristics that result in the emission of pollutants in gaseous and particle forms [49,50] . The primary and secondary pathways by which these emissions affect human health have been well researched. Several studies have been conducted to establish the relationship between ambient outdoor air pollution and many respiratory diseases as well as certain cancers [49,51,52] . Particulate matter (PM) and other pollutants such as ground- level ozone, oxides of nitrogen (NOX ), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide along with other air toxics in the form of volatile organic carbons are known to have the most adverse effects [50,51] . Fossil fuels have long been known to be responsible for air pollution. The potential for liquid biofuel as an alternative fuel to reduce pollution as engendered by the combustion of fossil fuels has been extensively investigated by several researchers. Many studies have indicated that the benefits of using biofuels as alternatives to fossil fuels are not yet definitely determined as there are trade-offs of pollutants observed especially those that are environmentally regulated [49–51] . While switching to biofuel combustion may result in reduction in emissions of certain forms of pollutants, it may in turn exacerbate the amount of others. In vehicles, the most recognized way of deploying biofuels is in the form of bioethanol and biodiesel blended with diesel fuel. Such blends could be in very varying percentages which tend to have varying impacts on emissions [49,50,53] . Several researchers have revealed that particulate matter as a result of fuel combustion will be very much reduced with biofuel substitution of fossil fuels [27,49,50,53] . Reduction of sulfur and carbon monoxide which are two major threats to air quality will be substantial with adoption of biodiesel and ethanol. Gaffney and Marley [49]  have stated that reduction of carbon monoxide emission as a result of biodiesel usage could be up to 60%. However, researchers agree that accompanying the above stated reductions will be a drastic increase in NOx  emissions of up to about 80% [49,50,54,55] . It is generally believed that the use of biodiesel blended fuels may also lead to an increase in unregulated pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) especially with high levels of biodiesel blends [53] . Turrio Turrio-Baldassarri, Battistelli [56]  explain that incomplete combustion of biofuels also leads to significant increase in emissions of aldehydes in the form formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Additionally, ethanol and biodiesel blends leads to evaporative emissions which may contribute to overall increase in ozone-forming potential in the atmosphere [50,53] . A recent study conducted by Millo, Debnath [57]  supports the indeterminate outlook of biofuel benefits in terms of air quality. In the above-mentioned study, it was one of the objectives of the author's to study the impact of blending ultra-low diesel with different biofuels on PM, NOX,  HC and CO emissions. They found that the loading level of biofuel blends significantly affected the amount of pollutants emitted and the trade-offs occurring thereof. For instance, while low and medium loads of biofuel blends resulted in substantial reduction of CO and HC emissions, higher loads recorded insignificant impact compared to traditional diesel fuel. On the other hand, while NOX  emissions recorded were significantly higher for low load biofuel blends than those of diesel fuel, they were generally similar at higher loads. In Brazil where ethanol blend fuels are being largely used in vehicles, there is a very high rise in ambient concentrations of certain volatile organic carbons such as acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. This rise is said to be many times greater than has been observed for other countries with limited use of biofuels in vehicles. Along with an increase in NOx levels, these volatile organic carbons being very potent precursors to atmospheric ozone formation has led to severe ozone air quality in several cities [50,53] . In Russi [58] , it is suggested that in terms of air quality, it is more advantageous substituting diesel with other fossil fuels than with biodiesel as it will result in average increase in emissions. Other authors such as Anderson [53]  and Scovronick and Wilkinson [50]  seem to agree with this assertion having declared that there should be an expected increase in deterioration of air quality in the future with increasing use of biofuels.   3.2 The dimension of third generation biofuels to the biofuel debate Microalgae are single-cell, photosynthetic organisms that are regarded as one of the oldest microorganisms on the planet. Due to their exceptional photosynthetic ability, they exhibit rapid growth rates with the capacity to double their biomass several times in a day. As a matter of fact, it is said that their growth rates 100 times faster than that terrestrial plants [21,61] . Similar to plants, microalgae accumulate large deposits of oil inside their cells using sunlight. Microalgae have opened up a new and interesting dimension in the biofuel debate. As earlier elucidated, biofuel production has substantially increased in the last decade due to their perceived environmental benefits as compared to conventional fossil fuels. However, crop-based first and second generation biofuels, which are the most commercially available, have turned out to be very controversial with respect to their competition with food crops for arable land [13,59,60] . Since the 2008 food crisis, which many experts deemed is as a consequence of the rise of biofuels, the potential of microalgae as a source of renewable energy has received considerable research interest with a plethora of studies carried out around the globe. This is because microalgae is deemed as an alternative to produce biofuels, without the concomitant competition with food crops as in the case of first and second generation biofuels [21,59–61] . According to Medipally, Yusoff [62] , the initial interest in the potential of microalgae to serve as a biofuel feedstock arose in the 1970s but had to be temporarily abandoned due economic and technical obstacles. Compared to plants, microalgae are more efficient as biofuel feedstock as the oil content makes up more than half of their biomass in some cases [21,60,61,63] . For this reason, the amounts of biomass and lipids that microalgae are capable of producing per hectare are greater than that of any kind of terrestrial crop [64] . Due to their high lipid content and their ability to generate greater quantities of biomass, microalgae are considered as the only source of renewable biodiesel that can replace fossil fuels as primary fuel for transportation purposes around the globe [21] . In fact, it has been estimated that it would take only three percent (3%) of total crop land area of the US to the grow microalgae biomass that could be used to supply its total transportation fuel demand [65] . The predicted low demand in agricultural crop land for the cultivation of microalgae means that they have a very good potential to produce life cycle savings in terms of land use change related GHG emissions [59,63] . The ability of microalgae to produce life cycle savings is further increased when it is considered that they can be grown in wastewater as well as possess a significant potential to sequester CO2 . In addition to this, it worth noting that the dry weight of microalgae consist of approximately 50% carbon, which is typically sourced from CO2 [21,61,66] . According to Chisti [21] , producing 1 kg of microalgae require fixing of as much as 1.8 kg of CO2 . This particular requirement for biomass cultivation has made microalgae a subject intense research for bio-mitigation, which could significantly increase its life cycle savings. One important advantage of microalgae is that it can produce several different types of biofuels through different processes [21,59] . Through thermochemical conversion methods such as gasification, pyrolysis, hydrogenation, and liquefaction, algal biomass can be converted to biofuels in the form of oil or gas. In addition, microalgae biomass can also be converted to bioethanol or methane through biochemical conversion processes such as fermentation and anaerobic digestion, while lipids in algae biomass can be isolated and converted to biodiesel through the process of transesterification [21,59] . Algae cultivation is another important process that can be undertaken through a variety of means. Generally, there are three main methods through which algae biomass can be cultured, namely; phototrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic [61,62] . As explained by Lam and Lee [61] , in the phototrophic, light is the main source of energy while CO2  represents the main source of inorganic carbon. On the other hand, the heterotrophic cultivation is undertaken independent of light, while organic substrates such as glucose, acetate, and glycerol are utilized for both energy and as a source of carbon. The mixotrophic culture can utilize either of the phototrophic and heterotrophic pathways to grow algae, depending on intensity of light and the organic carbon concentration [61] . These properties have positioned microalgae an excellent option for biofuel feedstock as they can survive very different conditions. Of the several thousand species, Botryococcus braunii, Nannochloropsis sp. , Dunaliella primolecta , Chlorella sp. , and Crypthecodinium cohnii , are some of those that have received significant research attention due to their already established commercial significance [61,67] . In spite of the above-outlined advantages of microalgae as feedstock for biofuels, it has been initially embraced with skepticism as questions still hang over its viability in the long run as far as environmental and economic sustainability are concerned, when it comes to large scale production. This is because most of the aforementioned advantages have been hitherto theoretical or based on lab scale analysis [59,61,67] . As a matter of fact, Chisti [21] , one of the leading microalgae researchers and advocates was cautious in his assessment, stating that it would take up to 10–20 years of further development in microalgae-based biofuel research to make it sustainable on a commercial scale. Many studies have identified energy intensive upstream and downstream processes in microalgae-based biofuel production as likely to result in net positive GHG emissions and make biofuel and economically unsustainable [59,61,62] . One of the main criticisms of possible commercial scale microalgae-based biofuels development is from the thermodynamic perspective. Large scale production would demand significant amount of fossil fuel input in terms construction of industry related facilities, nutrient supply to support growth of algal biomass, and the harvesting and processing of biomass [59,62,63] . Besides, cultivation requires temperature of at least between 20 and 30 °C which means significant amount of energy required during the cultivation process, especially in temperate areas. These, according to researchers may lead to net energy loss. Besides, Peccia, Haznedaroglu [63]  has indicated the potential for microalgae to trigger a different dimension of the food vs. fuel feud in the sense that it may compete with food producers for fertilizer. Using a stochastic life cycle model, Clarens, Resurreccion [68]  compared the performance of algae-based biofuels with other plant-based biofuels based taking into consideration technological parameters that prevailed at the time of research. The study concluded that biofuels from algae-based biofuels would have more detrimental impacts on the environment than conventional crops in terms of energy use, GHG emissions, and water use. According to the study, use of chemical fertilizers account for about 50% of the overall energy use and GHG emissions. To circumvent the limitations associated with microalgae-based biofuels, the concept of integrated biorefinery has been developed by researchers [59,61,63,66,69] . Many studies have previously acknowledged the potential of reducing life cycle emissions associated with microalgae-based biofuel by growing microalgae in wastewater as a treatment method, while the resulting biomass serve as feedstock for biofuel [59,61] . This idea of combining different microalgae-based systems and harnessing their synergistic benefits has led to increased research into integrated biorefinery in recent years. An integrated biorefinery employs the same principle as petroleum refinery, which produces several biomass-based biofuels, biochemicals, and power through multiple conversion processes in a single facility or interconnected multiple facilities whose synergies are carefully harnessed [64,70] . A biorefinery optimizes in inputs and outputs of energy and material. This is because the by-or-waste products of one component of the system is utilized for another component as an input, making it a self-sustainable and closed-loop system [64,70–72] . This significantly improves net energy returns when compared to stand-alone biofuel production systems. The concept of biorefinery is revolutionary in the development of microalgae-based biofuels as it promises the commercial viability as well as the long-term environmental and economic sustainability [61,64] . Many studies have recently been conducted to test the viability of the integrated biorefinery concept, and have yielded very positive results [71,73–75] . Chowdhury, Viamajala [73]  in their found that energy demand for biodiesel production in an integrated biofuel system was about 3–14 GJ ton−1  lower than that of a stand-alone production system. They also found that reduction in life-cycle emissions can be more than 70% in integrated microalgae biorefinery system when compared to the stand-alone. The integrated system in this particular study involved the use of anaerobic digestion to recover energy and nutrients, while producing additional biodiesel with generated glycerol within the system. Wang, Nordlander [74]  also assessed how integrating algae cultivation with an already existing biogas plant in Vasteras, Sweden could reduce environmental and economic costs. In this study, they cultivated microalgae biomass with discharged CO2  and disgestate from the existing biogas production apparatus, which were fed back into the production system to directly produce more biogas. Annual biomethane output in this integrated system increased by more than nine percent, which increases net energy output. Souza, Gopal [75]  studied the integration of algae and sugarcane production systems into the traditional sugarcane ethanol distillery in Brazil to access their impacts on lifecycle assessment. Results from the study showed that fossil fuel use in the integrated system was substantially reduced by up to 50%, while total GHG emissions also declined by 10%. Maranduba, Robra [71]  also obtained interesting findings that revealed that integrating microalgae-based biodiesel production into already existing Brazilian sugarcane ethanol production system significantly decreased GHG emissions, thereby improving the environmental performance. The integrated system reduced GHG emissions by up to 53–64%, compared to the baseline scenario of stand-alone microalgae-based production. The recent studies observed above have shown that microalgae-based biofuel production has made very significant progress. Biorefinery concept is playing a very key role in overcoming initial limitations that had been observed. Besides, there is constant research in further optimizing biorefinery design to improve economic and environmental performance [70,76] . There is increasing research in genetic engineering of some microalgae strains to increase their biofuel production potential, as well as enhancing technologies to reduce energy costs associated with cultivation and harvesting microalgal biomass [65,77,78] . All these factors combined continue to significantly increase the viability of commercial production of carbon neutral biofuels. 3.2.1 Advancements in other feedstock for third generation biofuel Besides biofuel from microalgae, the generation biofuel technology also takes advantage of new, specially engineered energy crops. There is noteworthy development to be made in this respect. Recent progress in plant biology promises to result in plants with better assets for conversion into bio-products [79] . New examples offer a vision for what we can anticipate in the near future. Recently, scientists managed to design low lignin content eucalyptus trees and poplars [54] , which are easier to convert into cellulosic ethanol [80] . Crop scientists work for the enhancement of biomass yields from energy crops [79] . In this field, sorghum is seen by many as an ultimate biofuel crop [81,82] . Miscanthus giganteus  (Miscanthus) and Sorghum bicolour L  (sorghum) are anticipated to provide abundant and sustainable resources of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production [83] . Crops with higher sugar content (sweet sorghum) [81]  tolerating dry conditions have been developed and are being tested for ethanol production. Furthermore, researchers designed a corn crop which comprises the enzymes required to synthesize its biomass into fuels [84] . This is an illustration for radical 'third generation' crops. The employement of such designed energy crops would make an influence on both carbon and energy balance of biofuel production systems. This may also enhance the long term biomass potential estimations, because these projections previously did not consider the developments in plant biology and biotechnology [85] .   3.3 Progress of fourth generation biofuels Fourth generation biofuels could be simply be referred to as advanced third generation biofuels, which aim at producing sustainable energy by capturing and storing CO2  ('carbon capture and storage' – CCS). By using processes such as oxy-fuel combustion, CO2  absorbing biomass substances for growth are transformed into biofuel [25] . The CO2  is then geosequestered by keeping in old oil and gas fields or saline aquifers. Therefore, fourth generation biofuels are considered as carbon negative rather than carbon neutral, as their generation captures away more carbon than it produces. If these systems could be applied on a global scale, this could result in reduction in the levels of atmospheric CO2  due to their carbon capture abilities. Besides CCS technologies, fourth generation biofuels are produced through synthetic and system biology approaches. In these approaches, first of all, designed photosynthetic microorganisms could be developed for the production of photobiological solar fuels or to manufacture high-value chemicals and biofuels, synthetic cell factories or organelles, secondly photovoltaics and microbial fuel (electrobiofuels) could be explicitly combined. 3.3.1 Synthetic and system biology approaches Synthetic biology is a new field of biological study that brings science and engineering together. It covers many different approaches, methodologies, and disciplines with different definitions. Synthetic biology could be described as the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature [86] . Systems biology studies the biological systems which consist of many mechanisms such as genes, proteins and metabolites, in one piece. In systems biology, the function of all these mechanisms and the dynamic interactions between these mechanisms are investigated together. Each biological system can be seen as a hierarchically organized network of interactions. Systems biology tries to identify all these interactions [87] . Fourth generation biofuels through synthetic biology [88–90]  is a new but intensely evolving research area that makes it possible to design a natural or synthetic photosynthetic/non-photosynthetic cell factories/ organelles to produce high-quality biofuels with high photosynthetic efficiency. The European Union bioeconomy strategy [20]  has predicted synthetic biology as a fundamental enabling technology for successful implementation of the fossil fuel substitution by simply generating several biological combinations, including an array of various biofuels. The production of biofuels by using minimal amount of raw material is extremely vital. This is due to the prediction that consumption of bio-resources will exceed their renewal capacity by 2030 if no action is taken [19] . Fourth generation biofuel production approaches based on genetically engineered microorganisms conceals the end products out of the cells, in return the costly fermentation and/or handling of feedstock applied in existing biofuel production are avoided. By synthetic biology approaches, microorganisms could be optimized for efficient fuel production. The classic process phases required for biofuel production using fourth generation methods are fewer, thereby avoiding large capital and operational expenditures. Although, advanced biofuels produced by microorganisms shows comparable characteristics as petroleum-based fuels, producing these biofuels with high yields necessitates the engineering of the microorganism's metabolism that does not depend on one certain feedstock or host organism. Synthetic-biology methodologies can adjust pathways to take full advantage of fuel production. Regardless achievements done in the field, there are still challenges to overcome in order to commercialize advanced biofuels towards, and to make them competable with conventional fuels [91] . Most innovative research made towards photobiological solar fuel production depends on unicellular algae and cyanobacteria [86] . Both eukaryotic microalgae and cyanobacteria are promising for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. For that reason, worldwide research and development programs are in development. Cyanobacteria will be favorable organisms for the generation of secretable small molecules. Eukaryotic microalgae are interesting for products for which cellular storage is important. Besides, the microalgae Botryococcus have been proven to have an outstanding ability to replace hydrocarbon based fuels due to their high hydrocarbons production and excretion capacity. However, their industrial utilization is limited by extremely slow growth rate and current knowledge gap on both biological and bioprocess engineering facets [92] . Although it is a promising research area, there are still a large number of tailbacks that need to be unraveled before eukaryotic microalgae and cyanobacteria can be commercially used as industrial microorganisms [86] . Progress in this field would be realized only based on the developments achieved in system biology [93] . Innovations in photobiological solar fuel manufacture requires further research in synthetic biology and production systems for the project of light-harvesting organisms/methods and the modelling of biological reactions [88] . Due to proven fuel production potential of photobiological solar fuels, it is expected that during the upcoming decades, photobiological solar fuels will be arriving into the market [86,94] . Through synthetic and system biology approaches, it is possible to create hybrid production organisms which uses renewable electricity and carbon for the generation of biofuels. A freshly developing area, microbial electrosynthesis (MES) [95]  depends on the ability of definite microorganisms to capture electron from electrodes to assimilate the reducing counterparts into metabolism, alongside with CO2  use. Through MES, electrofuels can be produced by the transform of energy from solar cells into storable energy sources. Electrofuels let renewables to be suitably and competently stored as a liquid fuel. Bacteria, appropriate for MES, carries electrons through the outer membrane. Direct electron transfer was projected to be the most resourceful instrument to carry electron from electrodes to microorganisms. The engineered MES organism Clostridium ljungdahlii  has already been verified for butanol production [96] . Recently, a novel integrative bioelectrochemical isopropanol production system was developed by Torella, Gagliardi [97] . In this system, to supply energy for growth of metabolically engineered Ralstonia eutropha, the solar water- dividing catalyst that was redirected for isopropanol generation, was employed. Authors reported the highest bioelectrochemical fuel production yields [97] .    4 Summary Biomass energy has been and will remain an important part of energy supply. Recently, there has been a major rise in biofuel production due to its perceived potential benefits in regards to mitigating climate change and solving the problem of energy insecurity. This paper has presented a comprehensive discussion of the pros and cons of biofuel adoption (summarized in  Table 1 ), and the strides so far made. It is seen that the scales at which biofuels are being developed differ from country to country, and region to region. The scales are particularly affected at the local levels by a complex interaction of social and technical factors. Different targets by different countries are seen to play a major role in the expansion of biofuel production. The drive towards biofuel development is likely to be stronger around the globe in the coming years as countries aim to increase access to cleaner energy services to meet goal number seven of SDGs, and signatories of Kyoto protocol aim to meet their GHGs reduction targets. Some researchers such as Bonin and Lal [11] , Havlík, Schneider [10] , Lapola, Schaldach [43] , Phalan [36] , Scarlat and Dallemand [34] , and Timilsina and Shrestha [27]  have defied the seeming belief that biofuels are inherently sustainable and environmentally friendly. Biofuel production may still possess enormous potential in the drive towards achieving a cleaner and renewable energy future. However, it may not always be ‘green’ at the biofuel “tunnel” in some cases as it may have negative impacts on the environment considering the entire life cycle. Biofuels from first generation feedstock which are the now commercially available are the ones which have been proven to be not so environmentally friendly. This coupled with evidence that expanded use of corn, oil palm and other food crops for biofuel production can interfere with food prices has been a cause for concern, with a need for a more cautious approach. Although Gao, Skutsch [26]  found no firm ground on which causal relationship between deforestation and biofuel can be established with all certainty, the emergence of biofuel hotspots in tropical areas cannot be overlooked. This also shows that first and second generation biofuel development may have the potential of affecting land uses in these areas and also induce deforestation. As a matter of fact, observations by Bonin and Lal [11]  and Hunsberger Hunsberger, Bolwig [33]  tend to give credence to the emergence of biofuel hotspots as had been revealed by Gao, Skutsch [26] . These have left legitimate questions hanging over the further expansion and development of biofuels as a sustainable energy source. For this reason, the impact of biofuels through cultivation of biomass, final conversion, and trade are increasingly being interrogated from the perspectives of all the three pillars of sustainable development; the social, environmental, and economic impacts. In fact, Buyx Buyx and Tait [12]  developed six ethical principles to evaluate biofuel policies across Europe which found most policies failing the test of ethics. A plethora of current research studies are, however, showing the challenges and concerns with biofuels are not insurmountable especially with microalgae and other advanced feedstock for biofuel production. The concept of integrated biorefineries which combines different microalgae-based systems promises to substantially raise the competitiveness of biofuels in terms of their economic and environmental sustainability. The prospects are even more interesting when considering studies such as Maranduba, Robra [71]  and Souza, Gopal [75]  who have found that the performance of first and second biofuels increases with respect to their life cycle impacts when incorporated into the integrated biorefinery system. However, because of the low conversion efficiency into biofuels, the technology is still not completely cost-effective and sustainable. The reason for the low conversion efficiency is because advanced biofuel production takes place under stress conditions, which decreases the growth and biomass production yields. New developments to obtain a sustainable biodiesel production was achieved in metabolic engineering of algae to enhance lipids without compromising growth rate [98] . In addition to various engineering methodologies to enhance algal fuel production [99] , study on algae biodiversity is also expected to expose high capacity species for fuel production [100] . Combined biofuel production from algal with the evaluation of waste water or digestate as a culture media and the improvement of cost-effective bioreactors and cultivating technologies are currently under development and likely to play an important role in the near future to make the algal biofuel production lucrative. However, there are still breakthroughs to be achieved for breaking down technical barriers and accelerating the development of sustainable algae biofuels. With regards to fourth generation biofuels, CCS intervenes at the source and replaces fossil fuels with renewable biomass; the systems scrub CO2  out of the atmosphere while supplying clean energy. Therefore, they are accepted as low-risk geo-engineering methods that could help us tackle climate change without shutting down the world [101–103] . However, while preliminary studies have indicated the economic feasibility of fourth generation fuels appears superior in the longer term compared to previous biofuel generations, there are still technical hurdles that will have to be overcome in the provision of supporting infrastructure. Per the foregoing discussion, there is certainly much research needed to improve designs and technologies associated with integrated biorefineries and other advanced biofuel technologies. However, the breakthroughs achieved so far means the future looks undoubtedly bright with their potential to produce a viable carbon-neutral energy to support the global drive towards achieving SDG number seven.  5 Recommendations- priorities for research and policy considerations Without doubt, biofuel production possess immense potential to supplement energy production in many regions around the world and its constant improvement means a future supplied with carbon neutral energy is foreseeable. However, to support the current targets in SDGs number seven, it should be acknowledged that biofuel in its present state is beset with its own problems especially on large scale adoption. With steady development in third and fourth generation biofuels, and careful management of first and second generation biofuels, most of the negative aspects can be neutralized. In this regard, following suggestions should be given attention towards achieving the SDG number seven targets:• There are still technological challenges and biological constraints in the exploitation of microalgae for biofuels, along with high cost associated with their large-scale production. However, their CO2  sequestering ability from exhaust gases and using nutrients and organic carbons from wastewater or digestate to enhance biomass productivity could decrease the cultivation cost and enhance the biomass productivity, therefore such a technology must be investigated further [104] .   • The last target of the seventh SDG is to increase supply of modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries through infrastructure expansion and technology upgrade. The progress thus far achieved with microalgae-based biofuels may be considered for developing countries especially those within the Sahara desert region of Africa. Since microalgae require high temperatures for cultivation and does not demand freshwater for cultivation, countries within this region which have vast areas of uncultivable land should be explored for their potential to support large scale cultivation.    Extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night that is typical in the Sahara desert may, however, present a challenge as current microalgal strains may not survive under such conditions. In this light, genetic engineering efforts may be aimed at producing strains that have the capacity to withstand such conditions. In the short term, it would be important to explore the possibility of developing closed and temperature-stable cultivation systems. A possible scenario could be black colored water pipes which deliver hot water for warming during the night and insulated glass which protects the greenhouse against overheating. In another dimension, it will be pragmatic to countries in the region with close proximity to the sea to ensure constant supply of water for microalgae cultivation. Maximizing unique local conditions for energy production is already being noticed in countries such as Egypt and Morocco where wind and sun energy are currently being developed on large scale to support the local energy sector. It is therefore imperative to explore possibilities of such conditions in supporing biofuel production to complement effforts towards the renewable energy drive.• Regarding first and second generation biofuels, improving on smaller scale production to cater for local energy needs may be the best option rather than commercial production which may have a negative trade-offs in terms of land use changes and GHG emissions especially in developing regions. It is clear biofuels possess immense potential to alleviate domestic fuel needs especially in villages. This article recommends micro and small scale biofuel initiatives to be the focus in these areas to offer alternatives for high priced traditional fossil fuels. Such micro and small scale initiatives are likely to be adequately resourced by raw materials in the form of agricultural residues. This can generate employment opportunities at the local level while not upsetting the traditional agricultural livelihood base of such areas.  • Land grabbing associated with large scale adoption of biofuels is obvious within developing countries. This phenomenon is undermining local livelihoods and merits acknowledgement by developed countries whose desire to increase biofuel consumption may be accounting for such detrimental external costs. It is of utmost importance that feedstock selection and production plan be sensitive to needs of the most vulnerable in society and ultimately not violate their fundamental human rights. This means feedstock production should not interfere and compete with food crops. Ideally, developed countries should limit the production of first and second generation biofuels since the 2007 food crisis seems to be proof of how their soaring demands for such feedstocks could ripple through the global food market. It may rather be beneficial if investments are channeled into the development third and fourth generation biofuels, and emerging technologies as well as other renewable energy sources for a balance. Such balance in investments will ensure a greater flexibility in energy sources as overdependence on any one could ultimately result in unwanted trade-offs.  • Developing countries must adapt appropriate legislation to ensure that biofuel development is guided by the principles of sustainable development fulfilling all the three criteria; environment, economy and society. Concerns raised must be tackled head-on and there must be a conscious and proactive strategies to forestall what could be disastrous fallouts from such well-intentioned initiatives. The stakes are all too high to adopt a “wait-and-see” attitude.  • Local policies should explore the possibility of attaining maximum benefits from mixed-cropping of energy crops and local food crops [105] . This has the potential of reversing many of the recognizable negative effects of biofuel production. First, energy crops to feed local biofuel production will be readily obtained without interfering local food crop production. Second, farmers can earn income from both energy and food crops grown on the same piece of land; hence better socio-economic outcomes. Finally, mixed-cropping would mean continuous production can be kept on the same piece of land with minimal use of artificial fertilizers which will limit emissions into the environment.  • To contribute in meeting targets of SDGs and carbon emissions reduction in Kyoto protocol, specific policies must be put in place before biofuels are developed and the developments must undergo careful monitoring and regulation. One of the greatest challenges for governments of developing countries to meet energy targets of SDGs will be rural electrification. These countries should design such local specific policies regarding setting up biofuel processing plants in remote rural areas to provide electricity. This, if successful will mean an alternative to placing such areas on national grids which are primarily fueled by expensive traditional fossil fuels.       References [1] C.S. Jones  S.P.
