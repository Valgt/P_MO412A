               The bioeconomy has been strategized to overcome many global and national challenges, from climate action to green jobs. Therefore, the goal is not to develop the bioeconomy per se but its sustainability with regard to the internationally agreed sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. For this purpose, it is important to safeguard biodiversity and nature base as the prerequisite of bioeconomy development (SDGs 14 and 15). Only then can the synergies of bioeconomy and socioeconomic development be enhanced, and other trade-offs could be meaningfully addressed.

Therefore, the goal is not to develop the bioeconomy per se but its sustainability with regard to the internationally agreed sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. For this purpose, it is important to safeguard biodiversity and nature base as the prerequisite of bioeconomy development (SDGs 14 and 15). Only then can the synergies of bioeconomy and socioeconomic development be enhanced, and other trade-offs could be meaningfully addressed.   Keywords Bioeconomy  bioresources  climate change mitigation  sustainable development goals  well-being   3.1 Introduction  Global Bioeconomy Summit defined bioeconomy as “the production, utilization, and conservation of biological resources, including related knowledge, science, technology, and innovation, to provide information, products, processes, and services across all economic sectors aiming toward a sustainable economy” (International Advisory Council of the Global Bioeconomy Summit 2018 – IAC-GBC, 2018 ) and acknowledged the broad and partly visionary nature of this definition. The breadth of this definition stems from the variations in its utilization in science and policy spaces. While science focuses more on technology, processes, and products, the sectoral and economic aspects of bioeconomy are emphasized more under policy contexts. Despite the broad and varying scope of bioeconomy, its development has been suggested as a remedy against various national, regional, and global challenges. These challenges that bioeconomy has been proposed as a solution include climate change adaptation and mitigation, sustainable resource consumption, and income diversification in rural areas (Council, 2015 ). Regardless of the positive attributions to bioeconomy, which are assumed inherent to its development, bioeconomy activities do not necessarily and inherently create a win–win in both environmental and socioeconomic dimensions. Such trade-offs exist in any system. Yet, their identification and adequate monitoring are essential to their avoidance or minimization. This way, unintentional negative consequences of bioeconomy can be avoided (Bracco et al., 2018; Bracco, Calicioglu et al., 2019; Bracco, Tani et al., 2019 ).  First and foremost, as outlined in Chapter 1 , safeguarding biodiversity is a prerequisite for a sustainable bioeconomy. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the opportunities and challenges of the bioeconomy, provided its boundaries are set to safeguard biodiversity. In this regard, the objectives of this chapter are to (1) lay out the importance of addressing the trade-offs between biodiversity and bioeconomy in the sustainable development context, (2) exemplify opportunities to synergize bioeconomy development and other socioecological developments, and (3) indicate major challenges and trade-offs of bioeconomy and sustainable development. The chapter concludes with examples of how national, regional, and global frameworks intend to address these synergies and challenges in bioeconomy development and sustainability.  3.2 Safeguarding biodiversity: a prerequisite for sustaining the resource base for bioeconomy Without a sustained nature base, there will be no avenue for developing a sustainable bioeconomy at its full potential. Life under water underpins the blue economy (Rickels et al., 2019 ), while biodiversity and life on land are essential for a sustainable terrestrial bioeconomy. With these relationships, the bioeconomy offers an opportunity to provide the necessary paradigm shift by positioning the nature base as the operating boundary of the economy to avoid past failures in allocating the right value to nature and biodiversity (Fig. 3.1  ). This relationship between biodiversity and bioeconomy is also outlined by analyzing normative and quantifiable targets, that SDG 14 (life on land) and SDG 15 (life  below water) are prerequisites for the bioeconomy (Calicioglu & Bogdanski, 2021 ). For instance, a bioeconomy strategy enhancing carbon restoration by forestation and biodiversity would directly affect SDG 15 (Sadhukhan et al., 2018 ). Besides sustaining the resource base, safeguarding its quality through biodiversity conservation is of utmost importance for developing a bioeconomy with resilience and long-term reliability. The full potential of the bioeconomy can only be reached through attaining healthy biodiversity. For example, mangroves and kelp forests provide habitats for fish species of economic value, as carbon sinks, and as nature-based erosion control structures (Vondolia et al., 2020 ). A diverse nature base increases not only the resilience but also the competitiveness of the bioeconomy since the innovations in biotechnology build on the diverse availability of bioresources. For example, the pharmaceutical sector is pioneering this advantage, creating the avenue for biodiversity to receive its deserved economic and social value (David et al., 2015 ). In addition, there are effective win–win solutions for safeguarding biodiversity while developing the bioeconomy. For example, promoting mixed forests will not only increase the resilience of the ecosystem but also benefit both biodiversity and the bioeconomy (Biber et al., 2020; Díaz-Yáñez et al., 2020; Hetemäki, n.d. ).  3.3 Socioecological feedback of bioeconomy: opportunities and challenges Identifying the opportunities and challenges is particularly important to establish cross-sectoral integration and collaboration to explore the synergies, and to minimize the trade-offs (Bracco, Tani et al., 2019 ). This section elaborates on these terms in the context of bioeconomy, by exemplifying the synergies and trade-offs that bioeconomy development brings to the socioecological space. 3.3.1 Opportunities and synergies The synergies that sustainable bioeconomy development provides (e.g., resource efficiency and circularity) are usually considered inherent advantages. Although this does not necessarily have to be the case and depends on how a state defines the bioeconomy and operationalizes the strategies, there are several examples on positive socioecological feedback of bioeconomy development. The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the relevant global agreements also recognize the need to combine cross-sectorial actions to achieve multiple objectives, maximizing synergies among the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and their targets (Calicioglu et al., 2019 ). This outlook will inevitably place new demands on policy-making processes and trigger novel institutional organizations and improved  coordination at various levels, which will have implications for bioeconomy development. One example of the synergy of bioeconomy development is that it can support the achievement of the SDGs of the United Nations (Ronzon & Sanjuán, 2020 ). For instance, for SDGs on no poverty, zero hunger, gender equality, and reduced inequality (1,2, 5, and 10, respectively), bioeconomy development can provide synergies by adding value to biomass and creating diverse income opportunities. It is important to note that it is important to include smallholders in agriculture and low-income communities to foster this synergy (Calicioglu & Bogdanski, 2021 ). Particularly, in low- and middle-income countries with available biomass resources and well-developed primary sectors, a sustainable bioeconomy could unlock new opportunities for economic development and industrialization and support economic and social objectives, such as reducing unemployment and expanding access to energy. In addition, for lower-income countries, better management of natural resources is often a key component of poverty eradication, climate-change mitigation, and resilient economic growth (Bracco et al., 2018; Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations, 2016 ). There are setorqal integration opportunities to ensure that bioeconomy development creates positive socioecological outcomes. For example, a forest-based bioeconomy can produce substitutes for fossil-based products, reducing the consumption of plastics. This reduced utilization of plastics would translate into healthier ocean ecosystems, economies, and communities (Hurmekoski et al., 2018; Miettinen & Ollikainen, 2022 ). Another sectoral integration opportunity that would reduce the demand for agricultural land and contribute to biodiversity conservation is the efficient utilization of organic waste as a resource. In Europe alone, there is an untapped potential of more than a hundred million tons of organic waste per year, currently being landfilled (Calicioglu, 2022 ). Apart from solid waste, nutrients in wastewater can be used to produce plant biomass such as willow (Sas et al., 2021 ), and phytoplankton such as microalgae (Calicioglu & Demirer, 2015 ), which can be further processed into biochemicals such as energy carriers (Bhatia et al., 2021; Calicioglu & Demirer, 2022 ).  3.3.2 Challenges and trade-offs The consequences of the trade-offs are critical, as they may impose some boundaries on the extent to which bioeconomy practices can be implemented (Bracco, Tani et al., 2019 ). Some potential trade-offs that might influence sustainability and, in turn, limit the boundaries of the bioeconomy can be listed as poverty versus biodiversity (Hengsdijk et al., 2007 ), water-energy-food Nexus (Walking the Nexus Talk, 2014 ), agricultural productivity versus climate change action (Ignaciuk & Boonstra, 2017 ), agricultural productivity versus employment (Poverty and Social Exclusion in Rural Areas, 2008 ), nutrient recovery from wastewater versus human health and soil quality.  Analysing the trade-offs of wastewater re use in agriculture: An Analytical framework by Kanyoka and Eshtawi (2012 ), Klapwijk et al. (2014) , income-inequality nexus. The SDGs and their trade-offs, by Machingura and Lally (2017 ), land use versus ecosystem services, sustainable forest management-related environmental versus economic trade-offs (Chen et al., 2016 ), and soil quality versus nutrient management (Bos et al., 2017; Bracco, Tani et al., 2019 ). The trade-offs and minimization measures are highly context specific. For example, a bioeconomy strategy that is promoting agricultural productivity could have negative consequences on employment. Therefore, a sustainable bioeconomy strategy should also consider income diversification for rural areas. A key challenge that bioeconomy development must tackle is ensuring the rights of the poor in accessing natural resources (water, land, fisheries, forests, and biodiversity) and food security. This is particularly relevant for countries and areas that have fragile institutions, more prone to conflicts, and vulnerable to climate change. Since bioeconomy depends on transboundary resources, rapid changes in the natural resource base would trigger global consequences (Calicioglu et al., 2019 ). In addition, unequal access to and control over land or lack of participation of communities in policy development processes would further jeopardize a just development of bioeconomy (Backhouse et al., 2021 ).  3.3.3 Identifying and evaluating the trade-offs and synergies in bioeconomy development The methodology to analyze the trade-offs (and synergies) should be versatile to enable modification in the evolving country case and from one case to another. Therefore, to date, not one methodology can meet all requirements (Fig. 3.2  ). Nevertheless, the literature provides existing methodologies that can be tailored for this purpose, each with various advantages and weaknesses (Klapwijk et al., 2014 ). One descriptive way to look at the complex system dynamics of synergies and trade-offs is their visualization through causal loop diagrams (Inam et al., 2015 ), enabling qualitative (Fig. 3.3A  ) or quantitative (Fig. 3.3A, B ) analysis. A causal loop can be constructed through a participative approach with concepts or impact categories (represented with disks, A). Once the indicators are selected (represented with hexagons), the diagram can be visualized semi-quantitatively (B). The change in the state of each element of the causal loop can be visualized over time (C) Fig. 3.3 . If data availability is not an issue, empirical methods such as correlations can show the inter-relations between two indicators (Fig. 3.4A  ). This method has been widely used in the literature. Ideally, indicators have their boundaries and target values. For example, Safe-and-Just living space introduces such boundaries for environmental and social terms (Raworth, 2012 ). If such boundaries and targets are available, the correlations among indicators can also be represented on web or flower diagrams (Fig. 3.4B ).    3.4 Efforts toward biodiversity safeguards in developing bioeconomy: boosting synergies and addressing trade-offs in national, regional, and global sustainability frameworks Due to the perceived potential to address global challenges mentioned in the previous sections, the bioeconomy has found its place in global, regional, and country-level policy agendas (Viaggi, 2016 ). These policy objectives and bioeconomy priorities  include increasing employment, economic growth, providing energy and food security, reducing fossil-fuel dependence, rural development, and climate change mitigation and adaptation (Bracco et al., 2018; Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations, 2016 ). In this respect, this section discusses major global initiatives in the biodiversity-bioeconomy nexus, whether they intend to address the trade-offs, and if so, how.  3.4.1 Global examples FAO’s work on sustainability indicators provides technical assistance to countries in developing and monitoring the bioeconomy, particularly in line with the Principles and Criteria identified by the International Bioeconomy Working Group. These indicators help manufacturers and policymakers monitor and evaluate the sustainability of their bioeconomy strategies and interventions. The guiding principles, criteria, and indicators include aspirations and a measurable target-setting framework for biodiversity conservation (Bracco, Tani et al., 2019; Calicioglu & Bogdanski, 2021 ). The concept suggests a balanced and stepwise monitoring and evaluation approach, considering all dimensions of sustainability (i.e., social, economic, and environmental) while proposing a limited set of core indicators to enable the monitoring process to be technically and economically feasible. The authors identified two sets of indicators: (1) at the territorial level (which includes bioeconomy-relevant SDG indicators) and (2) at the product/value chain level, including indicators that are used for standards, certificates, and labels. The recommended methodology demands stakeholder and expert engagement in identifying relevant criteria and indicators based on a participatory approach, also leaving room for flexibility to reflect the circumstances and specific needs of the stakeholders. It also facilitates the addition of new indicators to improve the monitoring approach and adapt them to the evolving sector and policy needs (Calicioglu & Bogdanski, 2021; FAO, 2021 ). Therefore, the required emphasis on biodiversity conservation can be continuously given in developing, monitoring, and evaluating the bioeconomy using the proposed framework by FAO.  3.4.2 Regional examples European Union has recently updated its bioeconomy strategy, emphasizing the resilience of ecosystems and ensuring their contribution to climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection. This provides the basis for the national governments to identify priorities and strategies (Dietz et al., 2018; Luhas et al., 2021 ). European Commission’s Joint Research Center has developed an integrated modeling framework to measure the environmental impacts of bioeconomy. This framework identifies the consequences of a decision made in a system on other processes and systems of the economy. Once fully implemented, this approach would enable the assessment of the impacts of policies (Ronzon, 2016 ). Some environmental assessment and management approaches included in the new framework are eco-audit, strategic environmental assessment, and environmental and social impact assessment (Re-Linking Objectives and Potentials, 2018 ), which will further improve the emphasis on biodiversity conservation.  In Finland, the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research, the Bioeconomy Strategic Working Group, the Natural Resources Institute, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry are developing a system for bioeconomy monitoring in the EU Member States. One of the five objectives of the synthesized system is managing natural resources sustainably, alongside creating jobs and maintaining competitiveness, reducing dependence on non-renewable resources, ensuring food security, and mitigating and adapting to climate change (Re-Linking Objectives and Potentials, 2018 ). Standards, certifications, and labeling schemes also provide an opportunity to trace the biodiversity gains of bioeconomy development. In particular, most certification schemes for biomass, forest and agricultural commodities, biofuels, and biomaterials frequently mention sustainable intensification of biomass production, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable use of biodiversity. For example, EU eco-label for textiles mentions biodiversity conservation as one key indicator for labeling (Bracco, Calicioglu et al., 2019 ).  3.4.3 National examples Several countries have adopted bioeconomy as a development vision, decoupling growth from fossil fuel consumption and attaining global commitments such as SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement (Staffas et al., 2013 ). A sustainable bioeconomy, however, should not foster the depletion of natural resources, environmental degradation, or biodiversity loss. In this respect, technological innovations and business model potential should decouple bioeconomic growth and resource use (Preston & Lehne, 2017 ). For instance, the German strategy for bioeconomy development recognizes that the bio-based economy transition can be successful only if the food supply is secured, the environment and biodiversity are protected, and the policy objectives in developing and emerging countries are met (National Policy Strategy on Bioeconomy, 2014 ). To tackle this issue, Some areas that countries strategize in are sustainable agricultural intensification, attaining value to biodiversity through bio-innovations or eco-tourism, and measurable targets in the intersection of bioeconomy and biodiversity.   3.5 Agricultural value added-increase and intensification can play a major role in some countries’ success in achieving sustainable bioeconomy growth For example, countries with high feedstock availability, such as Argentina, focus on attaining productivity gains to increase international trade competitiveness (Hengsdijk et al., 2007 ) and building resilience for farmers through increased yields. In Malaysia, the bioeconomy success is governed by the success of the palm oil sector; therefore,  considerations around accounting for biodiversity loss and carbon dioxide emissions exist to make the bioeconomy growth sustainable (Al-Amin, 2016 ). Bio-inventions can also create a safeguard for biodiversity in several country contexts. The land availability constraints pose stress on sustainable biomass production in several countries. For this reason, for example, the bioeconomy strategy of the Netherlands does not include Agriculture and food sectors. Such countries could focus their bioeconomy on research and development investments in biochemistry and bio-pharmacy (Golden & Handfield, 2014 ). In countries with both high feedstock availability and industrial capacity, both expansions of biomass production and bio-innovations are possible (Biomass & Board, 2016; House, 2012 ). However, climate change and extreme weather events still pose a challenge in the former (Golden & Handfield, 2014 ), and might hamper biodiversity. Another important area in the intersection of bioeconomy development and biodiversity conservation in national frameworks is the measurement of bio-based goods and bioeconomy-related services. An example of such consideration is the Finland bioeconomy strategy, which includes some nature-based services such as fishing and hunting under the scope of bioeconomy (Golden & Handfield, 2014 ). Setting measurable targets for the biodiversity-bioeconomy nexus is important in the country context. If a bioeconomy strategy aims to contribute to environmental objectives, these should be included measurably in the frameworks. For example, based on the findings from the EU Bio-Based Economy Strategy (Sat-BBE) consortium on Systems Analysis Tools Framework (Golden & Handfield, 2014 ), Italy has developed a set of bioeconomy indicators to measure the impacts of bioeconomy on natural resources sustainability, food security, non-renewable resource dependence, and climate change (Golden & Handfield, 2014 ). Means of supply and production of bio-based resources and their consumption patterns are important to ensure the total sustainability of the bioeconomy. Adopting standards, certifications, and labeling schemes require both company and national-level innovations and long-term incentives and cohesion at the international policy level. Several country-level initiatives on labeling bio-based products’ “quality” and “sustainability” exist. An example of such a scheme is USDA’s Biobased Product label, certifying the carbon content of several bio-products. Similarly, Germany’s sustainability labeling scheme Blue Angel provides considerations for biodiversity conservation for pulp and paper, textiles, construction materials, and chemicals. Many existing bio-product certifications and standards give indications for monitoring environmental and social sustainability. Such transformational and innovative thinking is not limited to supply and production but includes consumer sensitization and behavior change (Bracco, Calicioglu et al., 2019 ).
