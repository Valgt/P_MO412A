                  Hydrogen as a clean, reliable and potentially sustainable energy vector has attracted growing interest for promoting the sustainable development of both industry and society worldwide. Hydrogen is a rising enabler for a multisectorial transition toward a low-carbon economy based on renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, there is a lack of literature scientifically scrutinizing the relationships between a hydrogen economy and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In this article, we argue that the new role of hydrogen takes effect as a game changer and review the policy framework for a hydrogen economy with respect to the prospects of success and its timing and to its role in supporting to reach the Goal 7, i.e. ‘affordable and clean energy’.

Keywords Hydrogen economy  SDGs  Sector coupling  Policy    For complete overview of the section, please refer the article collection - Sustainable Chemistry and the UN SDGs (2021)       Introduction Hydrogen is considered by many as a redeemer revolutionizing the energy system [1 ]. A hydrogen economy builds on hydrogen (and derived products such as ammonia) and electricity as energy carriers (cf. [2 ]). For hydrogen and derived chemicals, the term ‘energy vector’ is widely used and refers to ‘an energy-rich substance that facilitates the translocation and/or storage of energy [...] with the intention of using it at a distance in time and/or space from the primary production site’ [3 ]. Key aspects are here the possibility to store and transport hydrogen or derived chemicals over longer times and distances, as well as the possibility to produce hydrogen from electricity by electrolysis, e.g. a study by Michalski [4 ], and convert it back to electricity in fuels cells with rather high efficiencies, also in mobile applications such as fuel cell electric vehicles [5 ]. Hydrogen is also discussed for replacing coke as reducing agent in iron production to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [6 ] and for replacing (together with captured CO2) fossil fuels as feedstock in the chemical industry [7 ]. But there are also the pictures of the Hindenburg disaster highlighting the risks (cf. [8 ] and with a recent review on risks [9 ]). It is evident that a reduction to these aspects falls. First, hydrogen is only an energy vector [3 ] and the question how the hydrogen is produced and how the energy system around hydrogen is built are decisive [8 ]. Second, the current debate goes beyond energy supply for power and heat [10 ] and propulsion in the transport sector [11 ] but includes also the process industries [12–14 ], e.g. iron and steel [15 ,16 ] and chemical industry [17 ,18 ], and [19 ] highlighting the latter's key role within a hydrogen economy. Third, hydrogen is a cornerstone for deep  decarbonization in the energy sector allowing for the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs) at high shares by providing a massive longer-term energy storage service [20–22 ]. Further, in sectors currently relying on fossil fuel–based carbon such as the organic chemical industry, hydrogen enables a ‘defossilization’, i.e. a replacement of fossil fuel–based carbon by other carbon sources such as captured CO2, biomass, or recycled plastic waste [23 ]. Finally, the transition to a RES-based hydrogen economy challenges fossil fuel-based business models and countries whose economies rely on these and opens new and fosters already existing business opportunities in the RES sector, in the areas of hydrogen production, storage and consumption, in the provision of non-fossil fuel-based carbon sources such as carbon capture and use and producers of equipment in these fields, e.g., [24–27 ]. We argue that in its new role, hydrogen is a game changer and review the policy framework for a hydrogen economy with respect to the prospects of success and to its role in supporting to reach the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The SDGs and the hydrogen economy Although literature systematically analyzing the relationships between a hydrogen economy and the SDGs is lacking, some partial conclusions can be drawn. Synergies and trade-offs or incompatibilities between the 17 SDGs were analyzed in a study by Pradhan et al. [28 ] and Spaiser et al. [29 ], both by statistically analyzing past country time series data and in a study by Weitz et al. [30 ] for the EU using a cross-impact matrix. Spaiser et al. [29 ], for example, could not only identify a number of incompatibilities, e.g. between some environment goals such as low GHG emissions and poverty- and social inclusion–related goals, but also identify factors such as health programs and RES affecting both sides positively. Weitz et al. [30 ] point out that progress in target 13.2 (climate mainstreaming) promotes progress in SDG 7 (‘affordable and clean energy’) and in a number of further SDGs but that, for example, an extension of bioenergy or hydropower could have adverse effects on several environmental and social SDGs, too. Further analyses of the impact of RESs on SDGs in the EU can be found in a study by Meletiou et al. [31 ] and Swain et al. [32 ] (via electricity prices). A forward looking perspective is taken by von Stechow et al. [33 ] who stress that limiting global warming to 2 °C is a necessary condition for reaching the SDGs but not a sufficient one. Karlsson et al. [34 ] review the literature on climate cobenefits and find that these are often neglected and partly under-researched. Though any realization of a hydrogen economy will reduce air emissions and the health and environmental impacts related to air pollution, cf. [35–37 ], and aims at cutting GHG emissions, already the production of the hydrogen can be associated with severe impacts. Recent reviews and overviews on hydrogen production pathways can be found, for example, [8 ,38 ] (production in general), [39 ] (production and storage) [40 ] (photochemical), [41 ] (thermochemical) and [42 ] (solar), [43 ] (methane pyrolysis), [44 ] (nuclear), [41 ,42 ] (geothermal). Because a focus on production falls short, [38 ,47 ] call for a broader approach comprising the (energy) source, system, and service, i.e. the application step. There is a number of attributional (environmental) life cycle assessments (LCAs) of parts of a hydrogen economy. Valente et al. [48 ] identified 97 scientific articles until 2015 (a lot of them focusing on production and mobility). But there are only few examples for social LCAs, e.g., [49 ,50 ] as well as [51 ] (the latter for alkaline water electrolysis) or for life cycle sustainability assessments (LCSAs), e.g. in a study by Valente et al. [52 ] for biomass gasification. Further, assessments of the consequences  that would result when switching to a hydrogen economy (cf. [53 ] for German road transport) including rebound affects all of which can be analyzed by consequential LCAs are scarce: [48 ,54 ], the latter for the field of power-to-X systems. For supporting policy, more research is necessary: (i) assessing sustainability in an integrated manner, e.g., LCSA studies, (ii) accounting for improvements that can be expected to be made within this emerging technology (prospective LCAs), e.g. in a study by Valente et al. [55 ], (iii) acknowledging the role of a hydrogen economy as an enabler for a high integration of intermittent RES and deep decarbonization in process industry, (iv) assessing possible configurations of a hydrogen economy, i.e. taking a systems perspective, for both growth, e.g. in a study by Reuß et al. [56 ], and transition [57 ], as well as final configurations incl. the question of ‘best’ levels of (de)centrality.  Sector coupling and projections for green hydrogen The green transition in hydrogen production brings about lower GHG emissions but also further advantages. Parra et al. [58 ] provide a thorough description of the value offered by the power-to-X (P2X) pathway, encompassing renewable energy time-shift, demand load-shifting and electricity arbitrage, avoidance of renewable energy curtailment, ancillary services and frequency control, and seasonal storage. At a closer look, the sources of value listed by Parra et al. [58 ] are interlinked. For instance, storage is mainly motivated by the short-term quest for load stabilization [59 ,60 ], and by the need to overcome long distance in power transmission, e.g. in combination with pumped hydrostorage [1 ]. Nearly 15 years of evidence show that storage may foster the diffusion of RES ([61 ] is a recent case in point). Indeed, green hydrogen production promises to foster the integration of RES in the electricity sector [62 ], thereby enhancing the credibility of ‘100% renewables’ scenarios. Green hydrogen marks a shift to a new technological trajectory within the centralized generation paradigm, based on large-scale electrolysers fed through electricity from the grid [1 ], or a move toward a new technological paradigm centered on distributed generation and on energy prosumers [63 ,64 ]. Further, distributed generation matches better than the traditional centralized generation paradigm with coordination mechanisms characterized by decentralized interaction and limited scope of control, such as the market, due to its small scale and modularity. This should improve the performance of the critical functions [65 ], such as load balancing and frequency control. Relatedly, the storage possibilities allowed for by green hydrogen would allow grid operators and utilities to delay the installation of extra generation and transmission capacity for grid stabilization. On the other hand, there are trade-offs. Large-scale hydrogen production in areas with high insolation exploits economies of scale but leads to larger storage and transport demands and associated issues. In economies of scope, a better local fit might lead to overall good system  efficiencies and economies of number could be possible when making use of standardized modules produced in larger amounts (cf. [66 ] for chemical processes in general). Reliance on prosumers, although, emphasizes asymmetries in information and competence, that magnify misperception of costs and risks (see e.g. a study by Bakhtavar et al. [67 ] on energy communities). Despite such trade-offs, the transition toward green hydrogen sounds very appealing, but will it materialize soon? In the status quo, nearly all hydrogen worldwide is generated using climate-altering fossil fuels (natural gas, coal), 96% is the latest estimate [68 ], due to cost advantages: 1.5 to 2.5 USD/kg for gray (fossil fuel–based) hydrogen compared with between 2.5 and 7 USD/kg for green hydrogen [69 ]. Recent projections by BloombergNEF, although, indicate that green hydrogen cost will reach around 2 USD/kg by 2030 and 1 USD/kg by 2050 [70 ]. Depending on the prevailing policy scenario, by 2050 this will allow to meet a share of final energy needs comprised between 7% and 24% in a 1.5 °C global warming scenario [70 ], whereas the range is 6–18% according to projections by IRENA [64 ]. Reaching the same order of magnitude between water electrolysers and the renewable sources in terms of power scale is a necessary condition for the coupling between hydrogen and renewables [71 ]. At 2 USD/kg, the BloombergNEF report computes the carbon price thresholds that would enable the switch to green hydrogen in various sectors: 50 USD/tCO2 in steel making, 60 USD/tCO2 for heat and cement production, 78 USD/tCO2 for ammonia synthesis, and 90 USD/tCO2 for aluminum and glass manufacturing [70 ]. But as importantly, current research asks: in which countries will green hydrogen be more competitive? Hydrogen is currently far more costly to store than fossil fuels, and more expensive to transport via road or ship, due to its low density. Large-scale transportation can only be conceived through pipelines, but compatibility issues may hamper the use of existing infrastructures, or by transformation to methane, ammonia, and so on. Favorable geographical conditions, such as proximity and ‘natural’ storage facilities (salt caverns) are not wide spread. Bhagwat and Olczak [67 ] report that transportation through a dedicated pipeline linking North Africa and Europe would cost about 0.22 USD/kg. Estimates of transport costs in existing natural gas pipelines in mixtures with up to 10 vol% hydrogen in a study by Timmerberg and Kaltschmitt [72 ] are in the range of 9–19 €/MWh, but the production potential from North Africa exceeds the current transport capacity, hence transport may be limited to no more than 23.2 TWh/year. Schmitt [73 ] reports that behind the failure of the Desertec project there were disagreements on the technical and political viability of importing renewables on the European continent from the Middle East and North Africa region, also related to the involved security of supply and asset stranding issues. Cross-country variability in the delivered cost of green hydrogen is highlighted in a study by BloombergNEF et al. [70 ], with estimates ranging from 20 to 25% lower in the U.S.A., Brazil, Australia, and the Middle East, to 50–70% higher in Japan or Korea. Baruch-Mordo et al. [74 ] identify countries where land shortage may not allow us to achieve a target share of a 24% of energy via green hydrogen in a 1.5 °C scenario. Cross-country variability and security of supply issues call for partnerships across borders, much needed if SDG 7 is to be addressed without jeopardizing other SDGs, such as those related to poverty, growth, inequality, and peace.  Policy boosting hydrogen economy in line with SDGs Falling costs for RES and improving electrolyzer technologies could make green hydrogen cost competitive by 2030 [75 ]. For this to happen, innovation in hydrogen industry is strictly required [76 ]. Dincer and Acar [77 ] introduce the so called ‘18S approach’  (Figure 1  ) concerning those elements and dimensions of innovation in the hydrogen system whose appraisal should drive public and private stakeholders in evaluating, understanding and implementing actions and strategies to achieve a smooth transition to a hydrogen economy. Falcone and Hiete [78 ] analyze the role of visions in the transition toward a sustainable chemical industry which – among others – relies on CO2  as a feedstock and hydrogen as reducing agent, and stress the key role that corporate actors play in any transition, even more in disruptive ones such as the one toward a hydrogen economy. A policy implementation which ‘appears certain and credible’ is important for stakeholders to invest in low-carbon long-lived capital-stocks to avoid sunk costs [79 ]. BloombergNEF [70 ] present a list of signs for which potential investors should watch out to make up their mind whether a hydrogen economy is emerging or not. Kovač et al. [80 ] point out that ‘without market and hydrogen acceptance in the rest of the world, investments will be wasted’ stressing that the transition is a global challenge and requires thus acceptance in industry and the wider public. Building on membership data of hydrogen associations across Europe, de Klerk Wolters [81 ] provides an outline of the various sectors that support hydrogen economy and their geographic context emphasizing that the hydrogen has reached a broader basis of supporters. For researchers, the hydrogen economy is both a chance for greater public acceptance and for immense funding but could also pose a risk if research not directly aligned with a hydrogen economy receives less funding in the future. The prospect of positively contributing to a number of SDGs (the expected reduction of air pollution alone should allow to make progress in several SDGs, e.g. a study by Zhao et al. [82 ] for the positive impacts of a reduced air pollution on SDGs in China) must be regarded as a driver for the transition toward a hydrogen economy. Although, it is paramount to build upon a heuristic view of required changes to start inspecting which actors could foster or restrain innovations [83 ], a focus on national systems of innovation and policy has much to contribute to energy transition [74 ,75 ]. There are several national incentives for ensuring the low-carbon origin to: (i) promote the hydrogen production (e.g. the Netherlands, Norway, and so on.); (ii) foster the use of hydrogen in the transport sector (e.g. Belgium, Germany, Italy, and so on); and (iii) encourage the vehicle purchase (e.g. France, Spain, Norway, Belgium, and so on). However, there are very few supporting policies for the use of renewable energy–based hydrogen in industry [86 ], and these are mainly based on tax exemptions tailored to the replacement of fossil fuels (i.e. carbon tax exemption in France, deductible investment costs in the Netherlands). The European Commission has formally manifested its vision on turning hydrogen into a viable solution to achieve a higher climate ambition at a fast pace [19 ]. Numerous countries have recently implemented or are initiating and developing hydrogen strategies with the aim of satisfying their considerable energy demand. Seminal hydrogen national strategies were first released in West and North European countries (e.g. Denmark France, Germany, the Netherlands), whereas some South European countries (e.g. Italy and Spain) have their hydrogen strategies under consultation. Looking outside Europe, China represents the world's largest producer of hydrogen and is strongly developing actions and strategies toward hydrogen and fuel cell applications, with the aim of reaching a share of 10% of the domestic energy consumption by 2040 [87 ]. Australia is focusing on large-scale hydrogen hubs and the long-lasting perspective of exporting large amounts of renewable hydrogen to other countries (see in a study by Australian Government [88 ]). North African countries (e.g. Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt) have already acknowledged the prospect to produce and export renewable hydrogen at scale [89 ]. In this vein, the partnership with European countries can be strengthened in the next years through the Maghreb-European project of solar energy based hydrogen (cf. [90 ]). Recently, an industry association, Hydrogen Europe, is promoting a massive increase of electrolyzer production within the EU and Northern Africa. The project goals are based on some shared duties among countries for solar hydrogen development, such as the development of high-efficiency technologies, the development of hydrogen transport technologies over long distance, the measurement and monitoring of the employed technologies safety, and the effective training of experts [91 ]. Apparently, at this stage of technology development, the challenge for policy-makers is not ‘fixing the market’, but the very creation of a market for green hydrogen. This insight calls for a mission-oriented policy approach (see a study by Bijkerk et al. [92 ] on hydrogen, and [93 ] for the general approach). Such missions can operationalize the SDGs (‘grand missions’) or can be smaller missions catering to the SDGs (e.g. plastic-free oceans in a study by Miedzinski et al. [94 ]). Mission-oriented policies can be centralized or decentralized [95 ]. Mission-oriented innovation policies epitomize a novel approach, wherein strategic public sector initiatives and the proactive involvement of stakeholders help catalyzing the transition while solving public problems (e.g. social acceptability). Overall, a new paradigm in policy making based on a combined approach (top-down and bottom-up) is crucial (Figure 2  ). Rather than concentrating on specific sectors—as in conventional industrial policy—mission-oriented policy considers problem-specific societal challenges, where different sectors and actors co-operate for the transition to happen [95 ]. The mission-oriented policy approach might help capturing how the degree of top-down and bottom-up policy approaches can vary according to societal problems it aims to tackle. For example, policies that use bottom-up approaches are suitable when there is high uncertainty and lack of consensus (e.g. innovative financing system [89 ]). Conversely, strategies mainly based on top-down approaches are more likely in areas of high conflict about the concrete goal but somewhat high certainty on how it could be executed (e.g. carbon tax). This leads to the question how different components within the approaches should be aligned, and especially whether multiple instruments can be combined into a coherent policy mix. A potential intervention scheme is to combine a technology-push approach, able to cut production costs,1  1 Several production options are not mature enough or still under research and development and further work is needed to reduce the costs, increase the efficiency or improve the lifetime of the corresponding materials (cf. [99 ]).   with a market-pull approach to foster the market up-take of green hydrogen (e.g. feed-in tariffs as implemented for the biomethane injection into the grid).  Conclusions The review shows that a hydrogen economy provides a cross-sectoral perspective for a clean and—due to expected improvements—affordable clean energy supply (SDG 7) and deep decarbonization in process industries. The possibility to store hydrogen or derivatives thereof represents a game changer for the integration of high RES shares with positive effects on some SDGs via reduced GHG and air pollutants emissions. However, green hydrogen needs an appropriate policy to reach a level playing field that takes account of at least three issues suggested by the economic analysis of the sector. First, both centralized and distributed green hydrogen paradigms involve significant trade-offs, in terms of economies of scale and scope, storage and transport needs, energy literacy. Policy-makers may evaluate which paradigm solves the trade-offs in ways that are most suitable towards SDGs. Second, selecting the paradigm would require a comprehensive assessment of how green hydrogen impacts not only SDG7, but also other SDGs. Economic growth opportunities for developing countries well-endowed with RES may be at stake if geopolitical power, financial resources, and technology are unevenly distributed. Finally, the most recent cost projections on green hydrogen should not induce too much optimism. Deep uncertainty on the pace at which the world is reaching climate tipping points and the macroeconomic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic makes it difficult to formulate sensible expectations on the future cost of capital. Yet, wide post-Covid-19 recovery programmes place green hydrogen under focus. The EU Hydrogen Strategy plans to double the financial capacity of the InvestEU programme for renewable hydrogen within the new recovery instrument Next Generation EU. Maturity and pervasive applications across sectors are expected to be reached between 2030 and 2050. Concerning national measures within the EU, there is an ongoing debate on the inclusion of blue and green hydrogen in the Italian recovery plan, while Germany's corona recovery stimulus, already in June 2020, foresaw 9 billion Euros in investments to expand the hydrogen capacity [97 ]. Dincer [98 ] sees the Covid-19 crisis as marking a turning point to leave the carbon age behind and embrace a new hydrogen age. We argue in favor of policy actions for a hydrogen industry based on a mission-oriented approach, a new paradigm in policy making which combines bottom-up and top-down perspectives. In this respect, focusing on tailored policy mixes could represent the main route to fulfilling the socio-technical needs (e.g. infrastructures, health, acceptability, and so on.) and catalyze the transition toward the green hydrogen economy.
