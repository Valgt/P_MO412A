                  Until recently the extensive inter-dependencies between the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which consist of 169 targets, has received limited attention. Furthermore, the impact of the non-achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals may expose humanity to forms of global catastrophic risk and existential risk.
                  The paper examines systems approaches to identify and prioritise key SDGs whose implementation will have a desired feedback effect on other goals. Leverage points are also identified which may mitigate potential causes of global catastrophic risk and existential risk if the SDGs are not achieved, or if reinforcing feedback loops dominate. An awareness of these loops is essential and understanding the nature of the system structure they embody is important for the design of effective policy interventions.
                  Through a detailed inspection of a Causal Loop Diagram which conceptually links all the goals based on a review of recent literature, the following foundational Sustainable Development Goals are identified; SDG 1 No Poverty; SDG3 Good Health and Well Being; SDG 14 Life Below Water and SDG 15 Life on Land. These represent vital outcomes of achieving other goals and they are also critical in maintaining both a healthy human and environmental resource base on which progress towards all goals can be built. By examining a range of potential global threats based on a review of global catastrophic risk and existential risk, a further set of goals that can act as important leverage points are identified. The most important of these is SDG 13 Climate Action and SDG 4 Quality Education with SDG 2 Zero Hunger, SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG12 Responsible Consumption and Production and SDG 16 Peace Justice and Strong Institutions also having important roles to play. The interaction of all SDGs, acting synergistically together, is important to move the global system towards desirable outcomes and reduce currently increasing levels of risk.

Box 1 “The 17 goals lay out a clear plan of where humanity wants to go by 2030. But not much on how to get there.... To succeed the plan cannot be implemented in a conventional or a piecemeal way, picking SDGs at a whim as if from a smorgasboard. For instance, achieving good jobs and growth  (SDG 8) with zero hunger  (2) longer lives to all  (3) and better education  (4) can easily imply that life below water  (14) and life on land  (15) deteriorates even quicker than today. Similarly hitting targets on poverty reduction  (SDG2) in the conventional ways, can lead to higher resource consumption  (12) with more cars and fossil energy use  (7) weakening the achievement of clean cites  (10) and climate action  (13). More consumption will strain infrastructure  (9) to move more goods around, will put strains on available energy  (7) clean water and sanitation  (6), and to safely handle waste  (12)... This is why it is important to see all 17 SDGs as part of a system that is interconnected and inter-dependent ” (Randers, Rockstrom, Stoknes, Goluke, Collste, Cornell et al.

Until recently the extensive inter-dependencies between the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which consist of 169 targets, has received limited attention. Furthermore, the impact of the non-achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals may expose humanity to forms of global catastrophic risk and existential risk. The paper examines systems approaches to identify and prioritise key SDGs whose implementation will have a desired feedback effect on other goals. Leverage points are also identified which may mitigate potential causes of global catastrophic risk and existential risk if the SDGs are not achieved, or if reinforcing feedback loops dominate. An awareness of these loops is essential and understanding the nature of the system structure they embody is important for the design of effective policy interventions. Through a detailed inspection of a Causal Loop Diagram which conceptually links all the goals based on a review of recent literature, the following foundational  Sustainable Development Goals are identified; SDG 1 No Poverty; SDG3 Good Health and Well Being; SDG 14 Life Below Water and SDG 15 Life on Land. These represent vital outcomes of achieving other goals and they are also critical in maintaining both a healthy human and environmental resource base on which progress towards all goals can be built. By examining a range of potential global threats based on a review of global catastrophic risk and existential risk, a further set of goals that can act as important leverage points are identified. The most important of these is SDG 13 Climate Action and SDG 4 Quality Education with SDG 2 Zero Hunger, SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG12 Responsible Consumption and Production and SDG 16 Peace Justice and Strong Institutions also having important roles to play. The interaction of all SDGs, acting synergistically together, is important to move the global system towards desirable outcomes and reduce currently increasing levels of risk.   Keywords SDGs  Risk  Systems  Causal loop diagrams  Feedback    1 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted on 25 September 2015, seek to build upon the successes of the Millennium Development Goals with the objective to “end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all” (United Nations, 2018a ). They focus on five main areas: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership (United Nations, 2015a ) and are broader in scope and more ambitious than the Millennium Development Goals. The 2030 agenda emphasises the SDGs are interlinked, and recognises the importance of ensuring integration across all the sectors they represent, without indicating ways in which this might be achieved. The 17 SDG goals (Fig. 1  ) and 169 targets cover a far reaching scope and so it will not be possible for governments to follow each and every one, suggesting that to make progress some goals should be chosen over others (Carant, 2017 ). However because of the inherent complexity of the inter-related dilemmas involved, attaining improvement toward one SDG by 2030 may come at the expense of another (Barbier & Burgess, 2017 ). Not knowing where to prioritise action is a consequence of the overwhelming scale of issues that need to be addressed. Furthermore, there are dangers if national planning strategies focus on a goal-by-goal and target by target approach, neglecting the mutual influences between them (ESCAP, 2017 ). Criticisms of the SDGs focus on the contradictions that exist in the targets for certain goals (Carant, 2017 ), that enforcement of goal achievement is difficult and that global corporations are not included in the targets (Madeley, 2015 ). Furthermore, the SDGs permit economic growth to continue un-adjusted, which causes concern with respect to operating within planetary boundaries and this has raised fears regarding further resource and environmental exploitation (Kopnina, 2016 ). The SDGs have been seen as a “top-down approach designed by the political elite” (Caido, Filho, Quelhas, Nascimento, & Ávila, 2018 ). There is a distinct lack of emphasis for non-human species with the possibility that “implementation of many of these goals are likely in fact to exacerbate environmental crises” (Kopnina, 2016 ), despite 4 of the 17 goals directly referring to the health of the global ecosystem (Mastrojeni, 2018 ). Whilst pragmatically focusing on the short term through to 2030, the lack of long-term planning has been highlighted by the absence of global population goals and boundaries in those targets considering environmental constraints, despite well-known connections between population growth and environmental degradation (Bergaglio, 2016 ). The global indicator framework for the SDGs was formally adopted in 2017 (Leadership Council of the Sustainable Development Solution Network, 2015 ) and includes 232 indicators, although data so far has only been collected for 134 indicators (UNSD, 2018 ). Differences in national data quality and availability between countries makes a reliable assessment of progress within the SDGs difficult and the suitability of some indicators has been questioned (Costanza et al., 2007 ; Kubiszewski, 2014 ; Wallis, 2016 ). Other indicators have been put forward to tackle failings in conventional indicators (which are typically driven by the availability of existing data) but these remain disputed (Dopke & Maschke, 2016 ; Felice, 2016 ; Howard & Chambers, 2016 ; Novaček & Mederly, 2015 ). For example, Lim, Jorgensen, and Wyborn (2018))  point out that SDG 1  treats poverty as equal wherever it occurs and leans toward economic dimensions of poverty rather than its multi-dimensional nature. This fails to address marked poverty differences in different countries reflected in political liberty, social empowerment, dignity and good health and education (Sen, 1999 ). This may lead to wealthier nations focussing first on their own poverty needs and not responding to greater deprivations in poorer nations. As a baseline Barbier and Burgess (2017)  have shown the progress of representative indicators relating to each goal over the period 2000–2015, with most improving, whilst seven declined: SDG 8 (Decent Work Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for Goals). The SDGs themselves are framed in ways that can stimulate countless strategies but which are unhelpful in providing a spotlight on where and how to concentrate specific actions. Moreover the consequences of not achieving each of the SDGs are seldom explicitly addressed, and yet these consequences can be used as a rational basis for prioritising which goals should take precedence. To deliver all the SDGs by 2030 will require a concerted global effort, in which both time and monetary constraints must be overcome. Recent reports have highlighted the importance of the inter-relationships and dependancies between the various goals (United Nations, 2015a ; Zhang, Prouty, Zimmerman, & Mihelcic, 2016 ; ESCAP, 2017 ; United Nations, 2018b ) with Stafford-Smith et al., 2016  noting: “there must be greater attention on inter-linkages in three areas: across sectors, across societal actors, and between and among low, medium and high-income countries”. Additionally efforts to implement targets and hence achieve goals may have undesired effects on the success of other targets and goals if the SDGs are not considered holistically and part of a wider comprehensively inter-related structure. Despite this, Ferri and Sedehi (2018)  have catalogued examples of where analysis of the SDGs have underplayed these connections or where SDGs have been looked at as standalone objectives. The multiple aspects of the SDGs are largely contained within conventional sectors and frequently discussed as separate elements, mostly in isolation from each other (Lim et al., 2018 ; Nilsson & Costanza, 2015 ) Some commentators have pointed to the benefits of linking the SDGS with the Paris climate change targets as expressed in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), as in many countries they are often unconnected and the former frequently inspire a sense of opportunity whilst the latter are regarded as a limitation (Araya, 2018 ). However improving climate action (SDG 13) may lead to tradeoffs with other SDGs, with von Stechow et al. (2016)  arguing that some 2 °C pathways could undermine non climate goals, with limited short term INDCs having higher sustainable development risks than more ambitious ones, reinforcing the notion that climate policy and SDG agendas should be tracked within a unified framework. Against this background this paper examines system approaches to identify and prioritise key SDGs whose implementation will have a feedback effect on other goals. From this scrutiny of recent literature a subset of foundational SDGs are proposed which enable the pre-requisite conditions from which success in other goals can be achieved. They are used to examine potential global catastrophic and existential risks if they are not achieved.  2 Systems representations of the SDGs 2.1 Interactions between SDGs There is a growing body of literature seeking to analyse the system interactions between the SDGs with a comprehensive analysis reported by Zhang et al. (2016) , who developed a conceptual representation based on a causal loop diagram validated from the literature and iterated with experienced practitioners. This study qualitatively identified key leverage points as: gender equality, sustainable management of water and sanitation, alternative resources, sustainable livelihood standards, and global partnerships and is an example of how this approach can be used to establish which SDGs are precursors necessary for others to be achieved. For example developing resilient infrastructure (SDG 9) can enhance water (SDG 6) and energy (SDG 7) provision leading to wide improvements in well being (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), sustainable cities (SDG 11), as well as stimulating economic growth (SDG 8) and so enabling more investment in resilient infrastructure. Zhang’s study is critical of reductionist approaches in development, as this often prevents the inter-linkages between goals being realised. The potential complexity of interactions is visually captured in a causal loop diagram produced by (Nikolova, 2016 ) showing the myriad of relationships between all the SDGs (Fig. 2  ). In this example SDG 6 is the specific focus of interest providing both the means for development and preservation of natural processes as well as an enabler of human well being and sustainable development. The diagram was based on an analysis of the inter-linkages of SDG 6 and the targets of the other 16 SDGs using a comparative SDG targets matrix. The influence of one SDG or target on another can be scored on a simple scale proposed by Nilsson, Griggs, and Visbeck (2016) . This defines seven possible interaction types (scoring from +3 to -3) thus providing a framework which can help policymakers understand whether an interaction is reversible, acts in both directions, and has a strong or weak interaction and so be used to identify the interactions which are most important to tackle. Statistically extending this approach, Pradhan, Costa, Rybski, Lucht, and Kropp (2017)  have classified pairs of SDG indicators as synergies (where one goal favours the progress of another) or tradeoffs (where progress in one goal hinders another). The SDG interactions reported are complex with both positive and negative interactions observed. The analysis shows SDG 3 (Good Health and Well being) is associated mostly with synergistic co-benefits and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) is largely linked with the most problematic tradeoffs. Recognising the linkages between climate change and sustainable development, the Millenium Institute’s Integrated Sustainable Development Goals (iSDG) model provides a simulation tool to analyse policies and strategies intended to deliver the SDGs and to highlight their potential impacts. The model has been applied in 5 African countries to compare a business as usual scenario with an SDG policy mix including the introduction of photovoltaic and hydropower at large and small scales, energy efficiency measures in the industrial, domestic and transportation sectors and sustainable agriculture. Arquitt, Pedercini, Onasanya, and Herren (2018)  report that while these policies reduce carbon emissions per unit value added, these effects are overwhelmed by economic growth and per capita consumption of goods and services. This reinforces the notion that intuitively appropriate policies in each SDG sector can have strong adverse impacts across the system as a whole. A further application of the iSDG model has been reported by Collste, Pedercini, and Cornell (2017)  which highlights the importance of feedback structure between SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) in Tanzania. Applying Nilsson’s interaction scale shows electricity access enables progress in educational attainment and life expectancy scoring +1 (creating conditions that further another goals) and bi-directional causal relationships between life expectancy and years of schooling score +2 (aids achievement another goal). This illustrates the impact of an intervention in one SDG area on several other goals.  2.2 Global models A broad range of different quantitative models which have the potential to support development planning for the SDGs has been comparatively evaluated using an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) by Allen, Metternicht, and Wiedmann (2016) , who point out the need for systems-based approaches to be balanced with meaningful model outputs. Whilst acknowledging the suitability of system dynamics models for exploring synergies and trade offs between sectors and their use in making a comparative assessment of alternatives, they point to problems with the correct definition of system boundaries and establishing feedback loops. Some (global) models are also too blunt and general to explore the consequences of national or regional polices and cannot capture specific geographical contexts. Randers, Rockstrom, Stoknes, Goluke, Collste, Cornell, Donges et al. (2018)  have raised the concern that most of the influential integrated global models are constrained in their ability to analyse the trade-offs between increasing the human ecological footprint and exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth, with their structural rigidity limiting the combinations of SDG objectives that can be addressed. Using a quantitative global simulation model called Earth 3 Randers, Rockstrom, Stoknes, Goluke, Collste, Cornell et al. (2018)  have considered socio-economic and biophysical development through to 2050, and using one modelable indicator for each goal have assessed the number of SDGs likely to be achieved by 2030 and 2050. In a business as usual scenario their results show human societies becoming richer (as measured by GDP per person) but people live in more unequal societies and in an environment increasingly damaged by human activity. Accelerating economic growth leads to higher GDP, more energy use, more CO2  emissions and more use of resources with 11 SDGs achieved by 2030 but with greater global pressures on planetary boundaries. In a third scenario which sees a stronger policy focus on achieving the SDGs leads to more (but not all) goals being attained by 2030 and a halt in the downward trend of environmental goals. This leads to their conclusion that non-conventional - even transformational - action is required to create a sustainable world and satisfactory levels of well being for all. However the approach falls short of being a full system dynamics model as major causal loops have not been closed in the Earth 3 model and there is no feedback from the biophysical sub-model to the socio-economic model. This analysis reinforces the view that not all SDGs are equal, and that failing to achieve some has a significant effect on others (see Box 1  ).  2.3 Co-ordination across goals Reinforcing concerns that failure to consider systematic implementation of the SDGs as a whole could lead to perverse outcomes that could undermine Earth’s life support system, Lim et al. (2018)  warn that while all targets for SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) could be met this may jeopardise other SDGs, particularly those related to the environment. This may ultimately compromise the formally unstated sustainable development end goal “to meet the needs of the present while safeguarding Earth’s life-support system, on which the welfare of the current and future generations depend” (Griggs et al., 2013 ). Barriers for achieving a systems approach include the fragmentation of urban governance into sector “silos”, a failure to recognise multidimensional system interactions, inadequate mental models and lack of effective communication, lack of data (especially in most African and many Asian cities), and strong path dependency exemplified by the near irreversibility of the built environment and lock-in to prevailing land use patterns (Bai et al., 2016 ). Reyers, Stafford-Smith, Erb, Scholes, and Selomane (2017)  have suggested that developing Essential Sustainable Development Goal Variables (ESDGVs) can help focus on the minimum set of variables required to characterise a system. They should capture the essence of the system, focussing on leverage points for transformations and highlight areas where coordination is needed and systematically examining the linkages between existing targets. They call for a more advanced framing of global systems that link social, ecological and economic components of the SDGs and crucially the feedback between these. Costanza et al. (2016)  have argued that the SDGs lack an overarching goal and an effective indicator of progress towards that goal, proposing a Sustainable Wellbeing Index (SWI) that could be connected with the SDGs through a comprehensive system dynamics model that can track stocks and flows and make projections in the future. They group the SDGs under three basic components of a potential hybrid SWI as follows: Sustainable Scale  representing natural capital and ecosystem services: SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), SDG 15 (Life on Land); Fair Distribution  representing social capital and community contributions: 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well Being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 16 (Peace and Justice and Strong Institutions), SDG 17 (Partnerships for Goals) and Efficient Allocation  reflecting the net economic contribution: SDG 7 (Affordable Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). They suggest a conceptual dynamic, non-linear system model of the entire system of “the economy-in-society-in-nature” that keeps track of not stocks and flows with positive feedbacks from well being into human capital and negative feedbacks from wastes into all forms of capital and ecological services, pointing to such models currently under development. Similarly Lim et al. (2018)  cluster goals into 7 overlapping directions: stable resilient earth systems; thriving lives and sustainable livelihoods; stable resilient earth systems; inter-generational equity; intra-generational equity; education and innovation; sustainable economies. Again this conceptual mapping stresses integration of environmental sustainability within economic activities. An important component that physically links the SDGs is infrastructure. Thacker et al. (2019)  argue that there is a synergistic feedback mechanism between the SDGs and infrastructure systems which enables the delivery of the goals, (whilst the targets provide a checklist to guide the provision of infrastructure so itself is sustainable). A consistent and emerging theme is that some SDGs need to be considered as foundational, as representing the human and natural capacity for development, and attempts are made in the remainder of this paper to establish these and explore the risks that might emerge if they are not met.   3 Complex interconnections of the SDGs 3.1 Method There are many ways of connecting the SDGs and because of the myriad interactions involved it is a considerable challenge to represent with clarity these in a single diagram. Nevertheless building on the feedbacks and connections reviewed above, together with insights from other literature sources (listed in Fig. 3  ) a causal loop diagram (CLD) has been developed following Hjorth and Bagheri’s (2007)  approach of first creating sub-systems for the environmental, social and economic sectors (not separately shown here). The causal relationships between each SDG pairing were examined and considered as having either an immediate and direct causal influence, or an indirect relationship by passing through other goals first. A CLD such as the simplified one presented in Fig. 3  provides a visualisation of how the SDGs are inter-related and highlights where key feedbacks lie, which balance or reinforce the overall system performance. Methodologically this involves an informed qualitative conceptual framing and is a similar approach to that used by Lim et al. (2018) , Ferri and Sedehi (2018) , Zhang et al. (2016)  which draws from existing literature, logic and the authors’ deductions to achieve an initial overview of how the SDGs can be hierarchically structured. To enable this an assessment of the indicators associated with each goal was used (see Fig. 1 ) to classify the SDGs as being economic (shaded blue), social (shaded yellow) or environmental (shaded green) (see Fig. 3 ). The seven goals where indicators declined between 2000–2015 are highlighted in red in Fig. 3 . The structure of Fig. 3  has had cautious validation through the informal feedback of a number of academic experts. Fig. 3  hints at the complexities involved, with 3 goals SDG 3, SDG 4 and SDG 9 appearing in over 150 separate loops, whilst as drawn in Fig. 3  SDG 6 appears in over 100 separate loops. Careful examination of Fig. 3  can reveal aspects of the reinforcing and balancing mechanisms underlying the overall system structure, and this is based on standard notation where +ve associations show changes in the same direction between two linked variables, whereas –ve relationships show the coupled variables moving in opposite ways (i.e. increasing-decreasing). SDG 3 (Good health and Wellbeing) is central to the connections in the top left part of the diagram that group social attributes. In the right hand side SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure) are facilitators of key services, whilst SDG 13 (Climate Action) influences much of the bottom left environment sector. Many feedback loops can be extracted from Fig. 3 , which illustrate these relations ships. For example, in Fig. 4   Loop A shows how SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) reinforces investment in Industry SDG 9 (Infrastructure, Innovation and Infrastructure) which provides improved services such as SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), enhancing SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) and leading through increasing school attendance to better SDG 4 (Quality Education) providing a workforce able to secure jobs and contribute to a growing economy. Conversely Loop B shows SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) may create more pollution requiring stronger SDG 13 (Climate Action) which may slow further economic growth in a balancing loop.  3.2 Developing an SDG hierarchy Based on the foregoing the 17 SDGs are classified into 4 distinct groupings as follows: 3.2.1 Outcome/foundational goals SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well Being), SDG 14 (Life Below Water) and SDG 15 (Life on land) are considered to represent social and environmental improvements directly resulting from making progress towards the other goals. They are also considered foundational as regression in these goals restrict and limit the human and ecological resources required to support a safe planetary system.  3.2.2 Human input goals SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 13 (Climate Action) SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Institutions) directly represent the means and capacity which may underpin (or undermine) the ability to meet the other goals.  3.2.3 Physical assets goals SDG 6 (Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy),SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) relate to the engineered infrastructure systems needed to power and deliver essential services.  3.2.4 Enabling goals Enabling Goals and are SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 17 (Partnership for Goals). In particular SDG 8  is considered by many to be a necessary pre-cursor to investment in other goals (e.g. Zhang et al., 2016 ) whilst at the same time it may indirectly create negative tradeoffs with other goals through leading to adverse consequences such as the generation of pollution (Pradhan et al., 2017 ). When progress is measured towards meeting the targets in the human and physical asset goals the impact on the four outcome/foundational goals must also be reported, to safeguard the integrity of the whole system.    4 Risks from failure to meet the SDGs 4.1 Cascading failures Fig. 3  demonstrates that cascade failures can be transmitted through the complex inter-relationships that link the Sustainable Development Goals. Randers, Rockstrom, Stoknes, Goluke, Collste, Cornell, Donges et al. (2018)  have suggested that where meeting some SDGs impact negatively on others, this may lead to “crisis and conflict accelerators” and “threat multipliers” resulting in conflicts, instability and migrations. Ecosystem stresses are likely to disproportionately affect the security and social cohesion of fragile and poor communities, amplifying latent tensions which lead to political instabilities that spread far beyond their regions. The resulting “bad fate of the poor will end up affecting the whole global system"(Mastrojeni, 2018 ). Such possibilities are likely to go beyond incremental damage and lead to runaway collapse. The World Economic Forums’ Global Risks Report for 2018 shows the top five global risks in terms of likelihood and impact have changed from being economic and social in 2008 to environmental and technological in 2018, and are closely aligned with many SDGs (World Economic Forum, 2018 ). The report notes “that we are much less competent when it comes to dealing with complex risks in systems characterised by feedback loops, tipping points and opaque cause-and-effect relationships that can make intervention problematic”. The most likely risks expected to have the greatest impact currently include extreme weather events natural disasters, cyber attacks, data fraud or theft, failure of climate change mitigation and water crises. These are represented in Fig. 3  by the following exogenous variables. “Climate change” drives the need for Climate Action (SDG 13), “Cyber threat” may adversely impact technology implementation and advancement which will disrupt Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8) and the rate of introduction of Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7), with reductions in these goals having direct consequences in also reducing progress in the other goals which they are closely linked to. “Data Fraud or Threat” has the capacity to inhibit innovation and Industrial Performance (SDG 9), reducing competitiveness (and having the potential to erode societal confidence in governance processes). “Water Crises” (linked with climate change) have a direct impact on Human Health and Well Being (SDG 3) as well as reducing access to Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6) and reducing agricultural production which increases Hunger (SDG 2). The causal loop diagram also highlights “Conflict” as a variable (driven by multiple environmental-socio-economic factors) which together with regions most impacted by climate degradation will lead to an increase in migrant refugees enhancing the spread of disease and global pandemic risk, thus impacting directly on Human Health and Well Being (SDG 3)  4.2 Existential and catastrophic risk The level and consequences of these risks may be severe. Existential Risks (ER) have a wide scope, with extreme danger, and are “a risk that threatens the premature extinction of humanity or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development” (Farquhar et al., 2017 ,) essentially being an event or scenario that is “transgenerational in scope and terminal in intensity” (Baum & Handoh, 2014 ). With a smaller scope, and lower level of severity, global catastrophic risk is defined as a scenario or event that results in at least 10 million fatalities, or $10 trillion in damages (Bostrom & Ćirković, 2008 ). Global Catastrophic Risk (GCR) events are those which are global, but they are durable in that humanity is able to recover from them (Bostrom & Ćirković, 2008 ; Cotton-Barratt, Farquhar, Halstead, Schubert, & Snyder-Beattie, 2016 ) but which still have a long-term impact (Turchin & Denkenberger, 2018b ). Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals can be considered to be a means of reducing the long-term global catastrophic and existential risks for humanity. Conversely if the targets represented across the SDGs remain unachieved there is the potential for these forms of risk to develop. This association combined with the likely emergence of new challenges over the next decades (Cook, Inayatullah, Burgman, Sutherland, & Wintle, 2014 ) means that it is of great value to identify points within the systems representations of the Sustainable Development Goals that could both lead to global catastrophic risk and existential risk, and conversely that could act as prevention, or leverage points in order to avoid such outcomes. This identification in turn enables sensible policy responses to be constructed (Sutherland & Woodroof, 2009 ). Whilst existential threats are unlikely, there is extensive peril in global catastrophic risks. Despite being lesser in severity than existential risks, they increase the likelihood of human extinction (Turchin & Denkenberger, 2018a ) through chain reactions (Turchin & Denkenberger, 2018a ), and inhibiting humanity’s response to other risks (Farquhar et al., 2017 ). It is necessary to consider risks that may seem small, as when acting together, they can have extensive consequences (Tonn, 2009 ). Furthermore, the high adaptability potential of humans, and society, means that for humanity to become extinct, it is most likely that there would be a series of events that culminate in extinction as opposed to one large scale event (Tonn & MacGregor, 2009 ; Tonn, 2009 ). Whilst the prospect of existential risk, or global catastrophic risk can seem distant, the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change estimated the risk of extinction for humanity as 0.1 % annually, which accumulates to provide the risk of extinction over the next century as 9.5 % (Cotton-Barratt et al., 2016 ). With respect to identifying these risks, it is known that in particular, “positive feedback loops… represent the gravest existential risks” (Kareiva & Carranza, 2018 ), with pollution also having the potential to pose an existential risk. With respect to reinforcing feedback loops, there is particular concern about the effects of time delay, and the level of uncertainty when feedback loops interact (Kareiva & Carranza, 2018 ). It is difficult to identify the exact thresholds that are associated with tipping points (Moore, 2018 ), which leads to global catastrophic risk or existential risk, and thus it is necessary to understand the events that can lead to existential risks (Kareiva & Carranza, 2018 ). Table 1   identifies possible global catastrophic risks and existential risks as reported in the literature and from Fig. 3  these are aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals they impact on the most.  4.3 Linking risks with progress in the SDGs Generally it is the Outcome/Foundational and Human input SDGs that are most directly related. For example as the movement of refugees increases pandemic risk , poverty levels in low and middle income countries increase reducing the health of the population, and so restricting access to education which further enhances poverty and birth rates rise as family sizes increases generating unsustainable population growth which furthers the migration of refugees (Fig. 5  ). Fig. 3  shows that leverage points to reduce refugees lies in SDG 16 (Peace Justice and Strong Institutions), reducing malnutrition through alleviating SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and taking SDG 13 (Climate Action) to avoid the mass movement of people to avoid the impacts of global warming. Global warming  itself will drive disruptive changes in both terrestial and aquatic ecosystems affecting SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water) adding to their vulnerability to increases in pollution driven by a growing economy. Loop B (in Fig. 4 )shows the constraints associated with SDG 13 (Climate Action) may slow the economic investment in industry and infrastructure reducing the pollution generated, encouraging adoption of SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) whilst stimulating carbon reduction and measures such as afforestation, which will also improve the foundational environmental goals. Depletion of resources  and biodiversity  are strongly linked to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) through measures such as halving global waste, reducing waste generation through recycling reuse and reduction schemes, and striving for more efficient industrial processes. The more resources that are used, the less responsible is Consumption and Production which may thus reduce biodiversity (Fig. 3 ) and increase the amounts of wastes accumulating in the environment. The final driver of Global Catastrophic Risk is an agricultural shortfall  which will increase global Hunger (SDG 2) and widen the Inequality (SDG 10) between rich and poor nations and individuals. Quality Education (SDG 4) is important as a key leverage point to stimulate the generation and adoption of new technologies to improve energy (SDG 7) and water supplies (6) which can enhance agricultural production. Such linkages are convincingly examined and demonstrated in the recent film “The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind” (2019), based on a factual story of water shortages in Malawi in the mid 2000s. These examples may appear self evident, but it is the connections between the goals and how they adjust together that is important to consider so the consequence of policy actions in one area can be fully understood. Because of the underlying system structures global threats can quickly transmit through the system. Water Crises will limit the water available for agriculture and basic needs which in turn will stimulate a decline in Gender Equality (SDG 5). Technology disruption from cyber attacks will restrict the ability to operate Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11) and potentially expose populations to extreme events by disrupting transport, health services, and the ability to pay for adaptation and mitigation of climate related threats from a weakened economy. Conflict (in all forms) will increase refugees and climate change provides the backdrop against which all these interactions will play out. Whilst it is possible that general catastrophic risk or existential risk scenarios may eventuate from the non-achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, there are certain aspects within the causal loop diagram which if prioritised will reduce this risk. For example, to reduce the risk of pandemic, ensuring that the number of Refugees  is minimised, and is a leverage point. Similarly, prioritising SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) is essential and is enabled by many of the other goals. However, a feature missing from the SDGs is a recognition of the precautionary principle, with an implicit assumption that technological innovation alone may create improvements in many of the goals.   5 Limitations The feedback loop diagrams developed here present the world as it is represented by the literature, and interpreted by the authors. Thus, there exist limitations. From this qualitative visual approach the non-intuitive quantitative results that can be obtained through using a computer simulation for the system will not be discovered. Difficulties arise in reflecting the differing time delays implicit in each link, and the variability in emphasis and need between individual countries and regions is not well catered for in a single diagram. The depiction of causality is also a challenge as this can frequently work in both directions. Furthermore such diagrams rapidly become dense and so difficult to offer clarity to policy makers. Whilst Fig. 3  is an attempt at capturing many of the direct interactions in a single simplified general diagram, this may be better achieved at single country scale also highlighting the relationships with specific approaches to policy making and governance structures (for example as reported by ESCAP (2017)  for Sri Lanka, Tajikistan and Fiji, which restricts the analysis to a specific focus on the influence of SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation). Fig. 3  therefore offers a preliminary framing which can be expanded in specific contexts and locations. However, the graphical feedback loop methodology undertaken provides insights into system interdependencies, whilst gaining an understanding of the overall trends and structure that exist within the system. When assessing global catastrophic risks and existential risks for possible relationships to the Sustainable Development Goals, the scope was restricted through the exclusion of singular event scenarios such as scientific threats, volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, nuclear war, bio-terrorism, artificial intelligence, and unknown unknowns.  6 Conclusion The paper has attempted to consolidate recent developments in seeking a systems approach to explore the inter-relationships between the Sustainable Development Goals. Through the detailed inspection of a Casual Loop Diagram several outcome / foundational SDGs have emerged: SDG3 (Good Health and Well Being); SDG 1 (Reducing Poverty); SDG 14 (Life Below Water) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). These are both vital products of achieving other goals whilst simultaneously leading to the maintenance of a healthy resource base on which progress towards all goals can be built. By examining a range of potential global threats a further set of goals that can act as important leverage points were identified. The most important of these were SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 4 (Quality Education). Other goals that have important roles to play are SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Furthermore, the Causal Loop Diagram shows that addressing the following intermediate variables may help reduce global catastrophic risk: refugees, and increased agricultural production. SDG 16 (Peace Justice and Strong Institutions) and SDG 17 (Partnership for Goals) may be considered as having a direct or indirect influence on ALL the other fifteen goals as they provide the organisational and management requirements necessary to make the others possible. They may be considered meta-systemic with respect to stimulating the collaborations  needed for successful implementation of all SDGs, whereas the outcome/foundational goals relate more fundamentally to the primary conditions  needed for such success. The interaction of all SDGs, acting synergistically together, is important to move the global system towards desirable outcomes and reduce the currently increasing levels of risk. The design of effective policy initiatives should be based on an awareness of the feedback structures highlighted here. For policies to be analysed for their effectiveness and organisational mechanisms to be developed more detailed quantitative modelling will be required, beyond the scope of this paper but emerging elsewhere, (as evidenced in Section 2 ). Key feedback loops should be prioritised in development programmes, and many can be extracted from Fig. 3 . By giving preference to the targets of the foundational goals, there will be extensive far reaching effects to the other goals that will lead to greater levels of target and goal accomplishment. The 2030 target is largely political, set for consistency to match the 15-year timeframe of the Millennium Development Goals (2000–2015). However, in light of the incomplete completion of the Millennium Development Goals, which only consisted of 17 targets across eight goals (United Nations Development Programme, 2018 ; UNICEF, 2014 ), it is unreasonable to think that in the same timeframe the Sustainable Development Goals will be achieved, which consist of 169 targets across 17 goals (United Nations, 2015a ). Progress towards the completion of the Sustainable Development Goals is not linear, with many factors and causal connections within the system that will stagger the progress and thus the final achievement of the goals. However, even by prioritising the foundational goals and feedback loops, it is unlikely that the 2030 target will be met. For this reason, it is recommended that a long-term viewpoint be taken, and the notion accepted that some Sustainable Development Goals will be achieved before others. As part of this long-term view point, it is recommended that the goals identified above be given a similarly high level of preference to avoid the emergence of global catastrophic risk and existential risk and guide the prioritisation of policy initiatives.
