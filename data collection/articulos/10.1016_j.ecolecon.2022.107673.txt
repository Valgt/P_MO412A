                  Our research explores how Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to global governance to achieve all the 17 SDGs. We performed a mixed study through research synthesis, categorization, and network analysis. The main findings revealed that Stakeholder Capitalism and its principles are favorable to foster a friendly environment for achieving most of the SDGs and can contribute to global governance in achieving mainly the SDGs 8, 9, and 17. However, Stakeholder Capitalism literature is incipient for the SDGs 6, 14, and 15, needing further research development by considering non-human stakeholders and the environment. Findings also revealed that Stakeholder Capitalism could promote partnerships and consensus worldwide and be an optimal source for promoting decent work, economic growth, innovation, infrastructure development, and industrial dynamism in a sustainable manner. We also discussed how the primary constructs of Stakeholder Theory related to Stakeholder Capitalism could contribute to achieving the SDGs: stakeholder construct, stakeholder salience (power, urgency, legitimacy, and proximity), corporate social responsibility, and value creation. Furthermore, we proposed a novel comprehensive methodology helpful in analyzing literature and categorical variables by enhancing the explanatory power of results through research synthesis, categorization, exploratory data analysis, degree centrality, and cross-network visualization. Finally, we suggested an agenda for future studies.

Although Shareholder Capitalism systems have created wealth since the 20th Century, they have failed to distribute income, protect the environment, and assure equal accessibility of wealth for all. Thus, the current capitalism systems (i.e., Shareholder Capitalism and State capitalism) have not been enough to overcome socio-economic and environmental challenges (Pieterse, 2003 ; Smith, 2010 ; Alexander, 2019 ; Vogel, 2019 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). Schwab and Vanham (2021)  argued for the idea that, in ‘Stakeholder Capitalism’, all stakeholders should have the same power in a free-market system. In other words, Schwab and Vanham (2021)  suggested that counterbalancing the power of stakeholders matters in stakeholder relations in Stakeholder Capitalism since stakeholders differ in their salience (Mitchell et al., 1997 ; Agle et al., 1999 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). Check and balance mechanisms are embedded in Stakeholder Capitalism to equalize the power among stakeholders as well as the interests of shareholders and states are not above the interests of other stakeholders. Moreover, governments, industries, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are supposed to be interested in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Clarke, 2020 ) in Stakeholder Capitalism through voluntary agreements and actions (Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ), as well as by governmental policies and regulations (Perkin, 1996 ; Pieterse, 2003 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Oppong, 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). The most important is that the assumption of Stakeholder Theory is bringing ethics and sustainability concerns in social, environmental, and economic terms. Therefore, it is worth exploring how Stakeholder Capitalism can really contribute to the world economy moving toward sustainable development. In order to face the main socio-economic and environmental challenges in the globalized and digitalized world, global governance is committed to the SDGs that should be met by 2030, which is an effort of global governance to foster sustainable development in all dimensions of sustainability (United Nations, 2022 ). The SDGs could be understood as the primary tool for sustainable development worldwide (Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). The World Economic Forum (2022)  stated that Stakeholder Capitalism could help foster a more sustainable and inclusive global development: “Stakeholder capitalism, designed to benefit all stakeholders and the environment rather than just shareholders, could be a means to achieve better global health, greater sustainability, more inclusive development, and revived productivity growth”. In addition, Stakeholder relationships and partnerships have been considered essential to successfully implementing the SDGs (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017 ). Although Stakeholder Capitalism highlights the importance of convergence among societal actors and ethics in business, little is known about how Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to achieving the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda. Additionally, there is a gap in the literature about how Stakeholder Capitalism can effectively help global governance foster sustainable development and achieve the SDGs. Thus, this research intends to fulfill this research gap by exploring how Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to global governance to achieve all of the 17 SDGs. This research is original in many ways. First, this research lies in addressing how the construct of Stakeholder Capitalism (and its principles) can be helpful to global governance in achieving the SDGs by considering the literature through a research synthesis and network analysis. Second, we discussed how the main constructs of Stakeholder Theory (i.e., stakeholder construct, stakeholder salience, corporate social responsibility, and value creation), which are related to the construct of Stakeholder Capitalism, can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Third, we proposed and applied a novel comprehensive methodology (i.e., ‘cross-network literature analysis’) for analyzing literature and categorical variables. This methodology is useful for analyzing two or more informational or categorical variables through exploratory data analysis and visualization. Notably, this methodology has qualitative and quantitative strands that increase the rigor and reliability of results and data analyses by allowing the cross-comparisons of results of both strands. This manuscript is structured as follows. Beyond this introduction, a theoretical framework section discusses the literature on Stakeholder Capitalism and SDGs. The research design section (third section) presents all adopted procedures for gathering the scientific contributions for the analyses. Finally, the results are presented and discussed in section four, while the paper ends with a concluding remarks section and the cited references.  2 Stakeholder Capitalism and Sustainable Development Goals The origins of Stakeholder Capitalism are from the 1990s (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Badaracco, 1998 ; Sunley, 1999 ), interrelating business, economics, politics, and social affairs. Stakeholder Capitalism, as a multi and interdisciplinary subject, encompassed more fields of study, such as law (Mizuno and Tabner, 2009 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ), philosophy (Windsor, 2009 ; Pärl, 2014 ; O'Brien, 2020 ), health-care systems (Gilmartin and Freeman, 2002 ), pension policies (Clark et al., 2002 ; Brennan, 2005 ), public administration (Andresani and Ferlie, 2006 ), and environmental issues (Ochieng, 2008 ; Fama, 2021 ). Stakeholder Capitalism is a construct stemming from Stakeholder Theory, referred to as an economic system based on free-market. Different from Shareholder Capitalism, the free market in shareholder capitalism aims to satisfy global and local stakeholders' needs and promote overall convergence (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; O'Brien, 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). According to Schwab and Vanham (2021) , Shareholder Capitalism and State Capitalism are the currently two predominant types of capitalism. Shareholder Capitalism has been seen in most Western countries, e.g., the United States. State Capitalism has been seen in countries of the Global South, e.g., China. On the one hand, in Shareholder Capitalism, businesses prioritize financial profits for their shareholders, who own more decision-making power than other parts. On the other hand, in State Capitalism, governments play a pivotal role in societal governance and economics by distributing wealth and opportunities, intervening in markets, and directing national development. However, neither type of capitalism has been enough to overcome socio-economic and environmental challenges. Therefore, Schwab and Vanham (2021)  proposed an alternative system defined as Stakeholder Capitalism, in which all stakeholders have the same power in a free-market system. Furthermore, the main challenge for stakeholder capitalism, as proposed by Schwab and Vanham (2021) , is the fact that the attributes of stakeholder salience (i.e., power, urgency, legitimacy, and proximity) vary over time, in geographical distance, in social distance, and among different stakeholder types (Mitchell et al., 1997 ; Agle et al., 1999 ; Driscoll and Starik, 2004 ; Lähdesmäki et al., 2019 ). In other words, check and balance mechanisms are embedded in Stakeholder Capitalism to equalize the power among stakeholders, which is challenging to achieve since stakeholder salience varies among stakeholders. There is a genre of stakeholder theories in political economy, from more governmental intervention (e.g., Socialist/Keynesian) to less intervention (e.g., Libertarian, Liberal, and Neoclassical) (Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ). On the one hand, some scholars as Freeman and his colleagues, argue for the libertarian argument of which that Stakeholder Capitalism is based on libertarian principles of freedom, voluntarism, competition, continuous creation, complexity, and stakeholder cooperation (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ). On the other hand, some scholars have highlighted the role of governmental interventions in the value creation process and in the economy (Kelly et al., 1997 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). Additionally, some scholars proposed the construct of ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’ (CSR), which assumes that corporations have a social responsibility toward the community and the public sphere (Carroll, 1991 ; Carroll, 1999 ; Carroll and Buchholtz, 2009 ; Freeman et al., 2010 ). Even though there is not a unique perspective on stakeholder theory and Stakeholder Capitalism, scholars have a consensus that stakeholders should be considered in economic decisions and processes. Stakeholder Capitalism mainly comprises the digital economy, new value creation, and future economic progress (World Economic Forum, 2022 ). In this way, sustainability issues and sustainable development matter for Stakeholder Capitalism, such that a stakeholder approach is considered a critical driver for sustainability at the global and local levels (Smith, 2010 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ; O'Brien, 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ; Beck and Storopoli, 2021 ; World Economic Forum, 2022 ). The moral foundations of Stakeholder Capitalism are responsible for integrating a wide range of societal stakeholders as well as for implementing an agenda composed of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues in industries and businesses (O'Brien, 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ). ESG has been considered the most central value for stakeholder-orientation in organizations and society because it covers most of the concerns of a large set of societal stakeholders (Fama, 2021 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). Therefore, Stakeholder Capitalism is supposed to be critical for achieving the SDGs proposed by the United Nations by 2030. SDGs are 17 goals to be achieved by 2030 “adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015”, providing “a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future” (United Nations, 2022 ). For this reason, SDGs are also known as the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. All the member states of the United Nations are committed to be organized in a global partnership to achieve these goals.  3 Research design The research design was divided into three stages: data collection and wrangling; qualitative data analysis through research synthesis; and quantitative data analysis through network analysis. 3.1 Data collection and wrangling We gathered 45 documents from Scopus  on January 04, 2022, by using the following search terms: TITLE-ABS-KEY (“stakeholder* capitalism”) AND LANGUAGE (english) AND NOT DOCTYPE (ch) AND NOT DOCTYPE (bk) AND NOT DOCTYPE (ed.) AND PUBYEAR <2022. The cutting point was considering complete years of publications, that is, articles published before 2022. As inclusion criteria, the considered documents were articles written in English containing any variation of “stakeholder capitalism”. After carefully reading the abstract, seven (7) documents were excluded from the sample because they were unrelated to Stakeholder Capitalism. The exclusion criteria were the contribution to stakeholder theory, possible relation to the SDG thematic, scientific rigor, and deepened discussion of the documents. At this stage, 38 papers were selected for further analysis. All full texts of 38 sampled papers were inspected regarding adherence to each SDG. Thus, three (3) papers were excluded because they did not address any possible relation to themes regarding the SDGs. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 35 documents. Due to the small sample of articles, on June 26, 2022, we decided to perform a second searching procedure on the Web of Science and ScienceDirect scientific databases to test the accuracy of the sample. Web of Science reported 29 articles, while ScienceDirect reported 61 articles. The two results from these databases were compared with the Scopus sample. We noticed that the matching articles in our sample also appeared in the results of these two databases, proving that Scopus was an optimal source for providing the sampled articles. The non-matching papers of ScienceDirect were inspected by the two authors of this research, concluding that they fall into the exclusion criteria previously described.  3.2 Qualitative data analysis: Research Synthesis and Categorization The qualitative data analysis was conducted in two different stages. The first was the Research Synthesis  (RS), and the second was the Categorization  of selected papers. RS uses rigorous and transparent procedures in reviewing literature in a specific domain of science (Cooper, 2017 ). This RS followed the same procedures of research synthesis as adopted by Ferasso et al. (2017)  and Beck and Ferasso (2022)  by: (1) reading the full texts of 35 selected papers; (2) synthesizing the main contributions of each work individually; and (3) making a dataset of synthesized papers. For analyzing the sampled papers according to 17 SDGs, we considered only the mission statement of each SDG and how Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to achieving each SDG. However, we did not consider targets and indicators because it would be more appropriate to be done individually for each SDG and not in the broader perspective of SDGs as applied in this study. This procedure resulted in a Microsoft Excel file containing the synthesis of each paper. The RS resulting from this strand was used for categorization according to each SDG. First, each SDG was considered as a ‘category’ into which the most adherent  papers in the sample were classified (Miles et al., 2018 ). This categorization procedure considered the contribution of each of the 35 papers in the sample to foster a given SDG. Thus, each paper was related to one or more categories of SDGs. The categorized papers of the sample resulted in a matrix that served as an input file for the next quantitative strand, the Network Analysis.  3.3 Quantitative data analysis: Network Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis Network Analysis  (NA) is useful to understand the pattern of interactions of nodes and edges within a system. According to Newman (2018), even though there are many types of networks (e.g., biological, social, informational, technological, among others), the measures, metrics, and fundamentals are the same (i.e., centrality, transitivity, reciprocity, similarity, homophily, among others). Nodes  are points that represent an element in a network, and edges  are connections between nodes. In a network, nodes can represent abstract or concrete things, such as objects, ideas, concepts, and places (Newman, 2018). The type of network generated for this sample is informational  because the nodes represent two informational complex interplays clusters: (1) the literature in sampled studies; and (2) the SDGs. The information used for building these two clusters came from the categorization  stage of the qualitative data analysis. In this way, these two categories were represented in two different clusters of nodes. The edges in our information network reveal connections between a given sampled study (on Stakeholder Capitalism) and one or more SDGs. Thus, in this research, the edges represent the relations between sampled papers on Stakeholder Capitalism that revealed a specific feature of Stakeholder Capitalism that can contribute to achieving one or more SDGs. In other words, when a node representing a sampled paper is connected to a node representing one of the SDGs, the sampled study reveals that Stakeholder Capitalism can help in some way to achieve such an SDG. We decided to use Degree Centrality  for the NA because it can explain the power and influence of the nodes within a determined network; thus, Degree Centrality allowed us to identify the most influential nodes in both clusters. In other words, Degree Centrality revealed the SDGs to which the literature has shown that Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute. Degree Centrality  is defined as “... one of most useful and most widely used of network concepts” (Newman, 2018, pp. 126–127). Degree centrality is the number of edges that are connected to a node, and it basically represents the influence  and prestige  in networks. An optimal way to explore the Degree Centrality  of both clusters is by using Exploratory Data Analysis' (EDA) , which allows the identification of outliers, means, modes, medians, and quartiles. In order to analyze the behavior of the Degree Centrality of SDGs and sampled literature, we explored the patterns of these data by considering the recommendations of Tukey (1977) . Thus, we explored the main data characteristics and sample distribution by considering the classical Interquartile Range  (IQR), which is derived from the value of the upper quartile (Q3) subtracted by the value of the lower quartile (Q1), i.e., Q3 - Q1 = IQR. The upper whisker  is derived from the upper quartile value added to the multiplication of 1.5 with the IQR (i.e., Q3 + 1.5 x IQR). The lower whisker  results from the lower quartile (Q1) subtracted to the multiplication of 1.5 with the IQR, i.e., Q1–1.5 x IQR. IQR is mainly useful for identifying outliers whose are elements having significantly different behavior under a variable in a dataset. In this way, outliers will be higher than the upper whisker or lower than the lower whisker, that is, out of the IQR. Considering that the lower quartile  is Q1 , the upper quartile  is Q3, and the constant  is k , then the IQR formula notation is:Q 1  − k Q 3  − Q 1     Q 3  + k Q 3  − Q 1          Therefore, by considering the research purpose, Degree Centrality  is helpful to demonstrate which SDGs the Stakeholder Capitalism could better contribute to be achieved. Gephi  software was used for NA (Bastian et al., 2009 ) by considering the Fruchterman Reingold  algorithm. This algorithm was chosen due to its usability, reliability, and conceptually-intuitive features, better fitting for the research purpose (Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991 ). Boxplots were generated in R  version 4.1.2 (R Core Team, 2021 ).   4 Results and discussion This section presents the qualitative and quantitative results, followed by a discussion subsection. 4.1 Results 4.1.1 Qualitative data analysis This section presents the research synthesis of the literature on how Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to global governance to achieve the 17 SDGs. Moreover, it presents how Stakeholder Capitalism can help achieve them, as well as the challenges in Stakeholder Capitalism regarding SDGs achievement. Although the literature on Stakeholder Capitalism is growing, it has shown that there are many ways that Stakeholder Capitalism could help achieve some SDGs. SDG 1: No poverty.  Stakeholder Capitalism can help to reduce poverty in many ways. The literature has shown that in Stakeholder Capitalism: (1) policies and diversified tools are designed to improve capacities and resources of the developing and needy communities, which is a type of inclusive and community capitalism (Sunley, 1999 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Oppong, 2020 ); (2) co-management among organizational stakeholders with development policies promote poverty reduction (Ochieng, 2008 ); (3) business social function, corporate social responsibility, and business profitability are points equally important to industries (Alexander, 2019 ); and (4) challenges derived from the fourth industrial revolution will be addressed by governments, industries, and community altogether, by fair taxes, economic freedom, and community support (Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). Conversely, poverty and inequality are not the main issues in Shareholder Capitalism in which profit is the primary concern (Pieterse, 2003 ; Smith, 2010 ; Alexander, 2019 ; Clarke, 2020 ). According to Smith (2010, p. 192) , behind Shareholder Capitalism is “greed and self-obsession” in an unacceptable manner that leads to high inequality. Shareholder Capitalism is a greed-based system that results in “misery, impoverishment, mental and physical health degradation”. However, Stakeholder Capitalism is based on altruism resulting in “good will, caring and mutual support”. Therefore, Stakeholder Capitalism cares about social issues such as poverty; thus, ending poverty is an altruist goal embraced by Stakeholder Capitalism. SDG 2: Zero hunger . Economic freedom and food security projects in Stakeholder Capitalism can mitigate many hunger issues. For example, the literature has shown that economic freedom in Stakeholder Capitalism is vital to improving food and agricultural capacity production and diversity (Perkin, 1996 ; Clarke, 2020 ). Additionally, Stakeholder Capitalism is important for food security projects conducted by the government, civil society, and industries, e.g., food banks and technologies to disrupt labor markets for sustainable food production (Smith, 2010 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ). Thus, Stakeholder Capitalism can be useful to help global governance at least to reduce hunger worldwide. SDG 3: Good health and well-being . Governmental policies, corporate social responsibility, cooperation and partnership, the principles of Stakeholder Capitalism, and risk regulation are means of Stakeholder Capitalism to contribute to achieving SDG 3. The literature has shown that in Stakeholder Capitalism: (1) governmental policies and the welfare state and altruist corporate social responsibility of businesses can provide health services, improve the quality of life, and promote longevity for citizens (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Pieterse, 2003 ; Smith, 2010 ; Clarke, 2020 ); (2) cooperation and partnerships among stakeholders can constitute a creative force that creates value and promote health systems improvement (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Sunley, 1999 ); (3) the principles of Stakeholder Capitalism can be used to health reform in countries for improving health systems by creating value, and improving the health of citizens (Gilmartin and Freeman, 2002 ; Pieterse, 2003 ; Grove et al., 2020 ); and (4) by regulating unacceptable risks of loss of health and well-being (Petrick, 2011 ). In terms of value creation in Stakeholder Capitalism, Freeman and Liedtka (1997, p. 288)  asserted that stakeholder cooperation and creativity are the main sources of Stakeholder Capitalism in promoting health and well-being in a way that “people come together to create something”, such as “a way to heal the sick”. SDG 4: Quality education . The literature has revealed that Stakeholder Capitalism can increase education quality through governmental policies and the welfare state, and altruist corporate social responsibility of businesses can improve education quality (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Pieterse, 2003 ; Grove et al., 2020 ). This improvement is carried out mainly by local governments and their partnerships with NGOs and businesses (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ). Moreover, improvements can be made by promoting entrepreneurship, financial education, and hard and soft skills training (Petrick, 2011 ; Clarke, 2020 ). Considering that value creation for stakeholders is one of the main goals of Stakeholder Capitalism (Kelly et al., 1997 ; Harrison et al., 2010 ; Bridoux and Stoelhorst, 2016 ; Tantalo and Priem, 2014 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ; World Economic Forum, 2022 ), government investments in research and development foster value creation processes (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ). Furthermore, considering that education quality promotes social capital creation, better public service delivery, and more efficient goods production; education quality can contribute to building sustainable global capitalism that overcomes globalization challenges (Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ). Therefore, education quality matters to satisfy, create meaning, and meet stakeholders' expectations.. SDG 5: Gender equality . Although the literature has shown that gender equality has gained attention in Shareholder Capitalism through women's rights movements and societal and governmental recognition (Perkin, 1996 ; Pieterse, 2003 ; Clarke, 2020 ), Stakeholder Capitalism emphasizes equal participation of women in governance through its ESG approach by policies and laws (Vogel, 2019 ; Fama, 2021 ). However, Fama (2021)  stated that gender laws could constrain governance choices and lead to production and price inefficiencies in companies. Stakeholder Capitalism theoretically supports gender equality and equal women's participation in the workforce, director boards, and salaries (see Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). However, there is a lack of empirical studies that support or non-support gender equality. SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation . Research on Stakeholder Capitalism has not explored either clean water or sanitation issues. However, regarding value creation and cooperation, Stakeholder Capitalism could contribute to providing and improving infrastructure quality of public services and goods. According to Freeman and Phillips (2002, p. 341) , the principle of stakeholder cooperation in Stakeholder Capitalism “... says that value is created because stakeholders can jointly satisfy their needs and desires by making voluntary agreements with each other”. The same authors added that “... communities are also a part of the agreement structure of business since they provide...” public goods, such as water and sanitation. Therefore, further studies should explore how and to what extent Stakeholder Capitalism could contribute to SDG 6. SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy.  Although clean energy has been widely promoted by the ESG agenda of Stakeholder Capitalism (Fama, 2021 ), there are challenges for consumers and producers. On the one hand, most of the “... corporations may well be most interested in the SDGs that match their immediate concerns”, and energy issues are significant challenges for corporations (Clarke, 2020 , p. 38). On the other hand, regarding the higher cost of clean energy, “... some consumers are likely to choose the products of dirty producers because they perceive that their individual choices have little effect on pollution” (Fama, 2021 , p. 6), in these terms, governmental regulation could be a remedy. Furthermore, the ESG movement of Stakeholder Capitalism in the financial markets has given more importance to businesses with sustainable energy consumption, carbon footprints, and low sustainability-related risks, as BlackRock has done with its investment decisions (Grove et al., 2020 ). Therefore, Stakeholder Capitalism theoretically can support affordable and clean energy. However, the challenges related to the own interests of producers and consumers reveal that it is an arduous task to advance the energy systems and policies into clean and affordable ones. SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth.  Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to decent economic growth and work by:• Building trust, partnership, and cooperation among stakeholders to foster innovation and create value for all stakeholders (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Brennan, 2005 ; Mcvea and Freeman, 2005 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; Pärl, 2014 ; Arun and Babu, 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Coulter, 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ; Thakhathi et al., 2021 );  • Promoting decent work, better workplace environment, employee engagement and empowerment, benefits, and the rights of workers (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Mcvea and Freeman, 2005 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Alexander, 2019 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Coulter, 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Fama, 2021 );  • Employees share ownership in firms, which enhances productivity and employee inclusiveness culture (Sunley, 1999 ; Kurland, 2018 );  • Recognizing the legitimate representation of unions for workers and the role of cooperatives in the societal economy (Clark et al., 2002 ; Brennan, 2005 ; Coulter, 2020 );  • Assuring freedom to make agreements, healthy competition, a free market, and an entrepreneurial perspective, which is also important about existing diverse options and opportunities for all stakeholders (Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Mcvea and Freeman, 2005 ; Freeman et al., 2007 );  • The principle of responsibility considers social issues (e.g., inclusion, health, security, education, among others), environmental issues (e.g., natural resource management and rural development), economic issues, and many other sustainability-related issues (Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Gilmartin and Freeman, 2002 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Alexander, 2019 ; Clarke, 2020 );  • Transparency and accountability in organizational communication (Arun and Babu, 2020 ); and  • By fostering the circular economy (Clarke, 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Watanabe et al., 2021 ), sustainable global governance (Thakhathi et al., 2021 ), shared economy, and digital solutions (Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Watanabe et al., 2021 ).    In this way, trust and partnership among stakeholders are required to successfully develop societies in Stakeholder Capitalism, thus creating value for all stakeholders and fostering innovation. Perkin (1996, p. 202)  highlighted that “... for stakeholding is the key to the high level of trust and willing cooperation between executives and workers, government and citizens, that is the secret of enduring success and survival in postindustrial society”. Freeman and Liedtka (1997, p. 289)  reinforce this idea by stating that Stakeholder Capitalism is “... comprised of a collection of value-creating processes” from businesses, governments, and communities. For this, a sustainable society is accountable and has transparent communication (Arun and Babu, 2020 ). Furthermore, stakeholder cooperation enhances innovation and creativity (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Mcvea and Freeman, 2005 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; Pärl, 2014 ) along with an entrepreneurial perspective (Mcvea and Freeman, 2005 ), and community capitalism (Petrick, 2011 ). All stakeholders equally matter in Stakeholder Capitalism. Thus, to value workers and upgrade their workplaces, the workers are seen, in Stakeholder Capitalism, as “... a vital part of the value creation process” (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 , 292). In this way, businesses should also improve workplace conditions and workforce skills (Sunley, 1999 ). However, in Stakeholder Capitalism, businesses have responsibilities toward their employees, and “... employees have a responsibility to support their employers within reason” (Freeman and Phillips, 2002 , p. 342). Indeed, all stakeholders have obligations and rights within the value creation process. The best conditions and solutions are tried for all stakeholders in Stakeholder Capitalism. Although some stakeholders may have lost, Stakeholder Capitalism has a realistic view of the pros and cons of each situation within the socio-economic development of societies. According to Freeman et al. (2007, p. 312) , regarding the transition to Stakeholder Capitalism: “Not every interaction is a zero-sum game and not every interaction has a win-win solution. We should do our best to look for the win-win before jumping to other sub-optimal solutions”. In other words, in Stakeholder Capitalism, competition in Stakeholder Capitalism should be healthy and satisfy all or at least most stakeholders, surpassing the ‘winner-take-all’ of traditional capitalism. Notwithstanding the favorable approach of Stakeholder Capitalism to a sustainable and decent economy and work, it also faces challenges. Although there is much effort by businesses that signed the Brundtland Report Statement of a Corporation in terms of corporate social responsibility and commitment to the ESG agenda, no difference has been perceived from these companies to no-signatories companies. In this way, Grove et al. (2020, p. 62)  stated that: “... in protecting jobs, labor rights, and workplace safety during the pandemic while failing to distinguish themselves in pursuit of racial and gender equality”. The problem is the same as those discussed for SDG 7, that firms are more likely to care about SDGs associated with their short-term concerns (Clarke, 2020 ), and consumers cannot care about sustainability and worker-related issues if the price is low (Fama, 2021 ). Therefore, in-depth investigation in all fields of social sciences is encouraged to contribute to overcoming these challenges of the inter/multidisciplinary approach of Stakeholder Capitalism. SDG 9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure.  A stakeholder-orientation-based system per se is a driver for fostering industry, innovation and infrastructure development. The literature has shown that:• Stakeholder cooperation, stakeholder responsibility, continuous creation and creativity by stakeholders, and capabilities of stakeholders enhance socio-economic development because most different actors collaborate without losing autonomy (e.g., interfirm collaboration), thus improving the supply and value chains in the societal economy (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Gilmartin and Freeman, 2002 ; Mcvea and Freeman, 2005 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Smith, 2010 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Ross and Crossan, 2012 ; Pärl, 2014 ; Arun and Babu, 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Watanabe et al., 2020 ; Thakhathi et al., 2021 );  • Behind the innovation coming from stakeholder collaboration, there is legitimacy, responsibility, performance-targeting, long-term growth orientation, financial investment, and mainly value creation (Pärl, 2014 ; Vogel, 2019 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Watanabe et al., 2020 );  • “Value space” in Stakeholder Capitalism is important because it is “... the opportunity space that exists to create value by reconfiguring the business processes” (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 , p. 290), which allows innovation that stakeholders could not achieve isolated (Sunley, 1999 ; Pärl, 2014 );  • Innovation in Stakeholder Capitalism is also stemmed from an evolving ecosystem view, shapeable and changeable production processes in a supportive network and entrepreneurship approach (Sunley, 1999 ; Petrick, 2011 );  • Improving health systems infrastructure and fostering innovation in health care (Gilmartin and Freeman, 2002 ); and  • Stakeholder-orientation can lead to innovative decision-making through transparent and accountable policies and communication (Mcvea and Freeman, 2005 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Arun and Babu, 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ).    Furthermore, “... stakeholder capitalism is a way to resolve some of the deep tensions within capitalism, and to better foster the powerful innovations that can help us all live better” (Freeman et al., 2007 , p. 304). However, Stakeholder Capitalism's main challenges are that many local stakeholder partnerships could have a lower capacity for coordination and non-universality (Sunley, 1999 ), and, to some extent, there is a dependence of innovation policies upon the decision-making power of managers (Hahn, 2019 ). SDG 10: Reduced inequality . The literature has shown that Shareholder Capitalism is associated with poverty and higher socio-economic inequality, and employment instability (Kelly et al., 1997 ; Smith, 2010 ; Vogel, 2019 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ); and that transitioning to Stakeholder Capitalism can help to reduce the inequality by:• Stakeholders' Participative governance because opportunities are created and developed for the most needed and minorities (Kelly et al., 1997 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 );  • Stakeholder-oriented and inclusion policies, laws, fairer taxation systems, entrepreneurship programs, and the welfare state for less powerful stakeholders (Pieterse, 2003 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 );  • Corporate social responsibility, ESG agenda, charity and philanthropy, and other business measures for social and economic inequality reduction (Alexander, 2019 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ; Fama, 2021 ). Also, it is noteworthy that Stakeholder Capitalism goes beyond reducing inequalities (Kelly et al., 1997 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ) because it deals not only “... about a fairer distribution of wealth in society, but [also] the creation of more and different forms of wealth” (Ochieng, 2008 , p. 66); and  • Disrupting new markets in a supportive community as well as in a creative and circular economy that helps to overcome the challenges related to unemployment caused by the fourth industrial revolution and globalization (Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ).    However, Stakeholder Capitalism faces some challenges in reducing the inequality in societies because there is the risk of stakeholder partnerships taking part in measures that reinforce resource and access inequalities (Sunley, 1999 ). Also, societies based on Shareholder Capitalism that are in transition to the stakeholder society will have cultural, psychological, and value-related issues to overcome by changing wealth and self-obsession-based system to an altruist and supportive society (Smith, 2010 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ). SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities.  Communities are considered one of the main stakeholders in Stakeholder Capitalism, and they play a critical role in creating long-term value for the whole society as well as governments, industries, and civil society do by working in a transparent and effective engagement (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ). In terms of fostering urban sustainability, value creation and value capture are the most important aspects of Stakeholder Capitalism because all the urban governance will create better socio-economic conditions for the community's well-being (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ). In this way, regulatory aspects, sustainable practices and policies, ESG agenda, social justice, and strengthened community bondings are important for value creation in sustainable cities (Petrick, 2011 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ). Although Stakeholder Capitalism is supposed to theoretically help achieve the eleventh SDG on sustainable cities and communities, more studies should explore how and to what extent the theory converges to reality. SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production.  In Stakeholder Capitalism, industries, businesses, customers, citizens, civil societies, and governments are called to be compromised to develop a sustainable supply chain in terms of responsible consumption and production, even against climate change (Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Pieterse, 2003 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Smith, 2010 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ; Watanabe et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, the circular economy and the ESG movement play a critical role in transforming the consumption and production in the Stakeholder Capitalism supply chain into more sustainable (Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ). In this scenario, all stakeholders are responsible for using only resources that they intended to, not wasting resources: “Customers have a duty to use products as they were intended, or else take reasonable care, including the burden of responsibility, when they do not. ... Suppliers have the duty to do their best to make the supply chain work properly and be efficient” (Freeman and Phillips, 2002 , p. 342). However, governments and civil society should also formulate specific environmental and production regulations (e.g., social license to operate) to avoid irresponsible production within supply chains because some consumers would remain to buy products from polluted and not sustainable industries (Clarke, 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ). For this reason, the cost of sustainable and responsible production and consumption and the culture of sustainable consumption of consumers are two of the main challenges for transitioning from Shareholder Capitalism to Stakeholder Capitalism (Ochieng, 2008 ; Smith, 2010 ; Fama, 2021 ). By considering stakeholder demands, industries can avoid production waste and improve customer and supplier communication, value creation, and product quality (Watanabe et al., 2021 ). Further studies should analyze quantitative data and qualitative reports about Stakeholder Capitalism and the ESG movement regarding sustainable supply chain and consumption. SDG 13: Climate action . Shareholder Capitalism has harmed the environment and impacted climate change, and transitioning to Stakeholder Capitalism could mitigate these impacts and promote a resilient climate transformation (Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ). The financial system in Stakeholder Capitalism not only prioritizes businesses and non-polluting industries but also spurs innovations, investments, and firms that contribute to mitigating climate change issues. In this context, businesses and governments are accountable and transparent in their policies and processes (Grove et al., 2020 ). Although the literature has shown that ‘climate change’ is one of the issues that “... could be solved if companies embrace the principles of the Stakeholder Theory” (Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 , p. 365), current research is not enough to prove the efficacy of Stakeholder Capitalism in mitigating the forces of climate action. Therefore, more empirical research is required in this matter. SDGs 14: Life below water . Theoretically and practically, the literature is very incipient on life below water in Stakeholder Capitalism. Although the ESG agenda of Stakeholder Capitalism has an environmental concern, which includes concerning marine life (Grove et al., 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ), we found only the work of Ochieng (2008)  addressing the role of co-management in Stakeholder Capitalism to protect geographical locations of cities and nations, such as resources from lakes and fisheries. For this reason, there is an opportunity for researchers to advance both theoretical and empirical research on the relationship between Stakeholder Capitalism and life below water. SDG 15: Life on land . Although no sampled paper was linked to this SDG, it is recommended for further research on NGOs' role in defending of wildlife, fauna, and flora in Stakeholder Capitalism socio-economic and natural ecosystems (Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ). SDG 16: Peace and justice strong institutions.  In theory, Stakeholder Capitalism could help the world governance to achieve peace and build justice strong institutions because a stakeholder-oriented system is grounded in:• Decentralized and co-management decision-making approaches within a network and communitarian governance that is based on the societal consensus from stakeholder participation and democratic values (Sunley, 1999 ; Kelly et al., 1997 ; Andresani and Ferlie, 2006 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Smith, 2010 );  • A free and fair socio-economic and market design that fosters democratic behavior among stakeholders, such as institutions and legal structure that promotes convergence and tolerance, reduces conflicts, and strengthens the legal institutions (Freeman et al., 2007 ; Oppong, 2020 );  • A co-management approach that promotes convergence among stakeholders as well as rich contributions from the different “... knowledge and understanding of all stakeholders” (Ochieng, 2008 , p. 72);  • A no materialistic system rooted in an inner peace stakeholder culture characterized by self-reflection and mutual support (Smith, 2010 ); and  • Laws and regulations assure legal stability of the rule of laws that protects the rights and duties of stakeholders and regulates the industries for effective legitimacy and credibility within the socio-environmental and economic system, e.g., through social license to operate (Petrick, 2011 ; Clarke, 2020 ).    Stakeholder Capitalism provides “... a basis for social justice and belief in necessary institutions” (Grove et al., 2020 , p. 64), for which is required “... democratic politics and the coexistence of multiple publics” (Oppong, 2020 , p. 11). Therefore, further investigation should explore case studies of Stakeholder Capitalism societies on how they can enhance peace and justice strong institutions in different ways from Shareholder Capitalism, state capitalism, and socialist societies. SDG 17: Partnerships to achieve the goal . Considering that making partnerships, building governance consensus, and stakeholder cooperation and responsibility are at the core of Stakeholder Capitalism (Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ), Stakeholder Capitalism could be a powerful tool to enhance and constitute partnerships to achieve the SDGs and promote sustainable global development and governance. It is widely discussed in the literature on Stakeholder Capitalism that value creation generated by multiple stakeholders' interests is a driver for partnerships in Stakeholder Capitalism, e.g., public-private partnerships in cooperative network governance (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Badaracco, 1998 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Wrigley and Currah, 2003 ; Andresani and Ferlie, 2006 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Pärl, 2014 ; Vogel, 2019 ; Arun and Babu, 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Coulter, 2020 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ). However, Stakeholder Capitalism's effectiveness in building consensus and partnership regarding sustainable issues should be further explored. As stakeholders partnerships are created “... between stakeholders working together to achieve a common goal” (Arun and Babu, 2020 , p. 2422), the main challenge of Stakeholder Capitalism toward SDG 17 could be related to some negationists stakeholders that are not convinced about SDGs relevance. Thus, more effort will be required to create consensus among all stakeholders. However, despite this obstacle, the ESG agenda has been widely accepted and disseminated in businesses, industries, civil society, and corporations over the last decades (Fama, 2021 ), revealing that most global stakeholders would agree that all SDGs should be achieved. Thus, joining and celebrating new partnerships to achieve the SDGs would be easier.  4.1.2 Information Network Analysis SDGs and literature are the two clusters of information analyzed in this network analysis. They were identified and categorized in the qualitative data-analysis strand, generating the data needed for building the information network. This data was processed in the Gephi  software, which provided the Degree Centrality of each element within the two clusters. The Degree Centrality of the SDGs is shown in Table 1  , and the Degree Centrality of the literature in Table 2  . Fig. 1   depicts two boxplots of the Degree Centrality of the information network clusters. Boxplots are useful for data analysis because they provide visual information on the behavior of the sampled clusters for a specific variable. Here, the boxplots reveal the behavior of the ‘Degree Centrality’ variable for both clusters - the SDGs and the sampled literature. We set up these boxplots using R  (R Core Team, 2021 ) so that the IQR for data distribution was considered (Tukey, 1977 ). The y-axis of these boxplots presents the Degree Centrality, and the x-axis contains one boxplot for each cluster. The points seen within these boxplots represent each element of the network. For example, there are 17 points within the boxplot of the SDGs and 35 points within the boxplot of literature. In other words, each point in the boxplot of the SDGs represents one SDG in essence, and each point in the boxplot for literature represents a single sampled study. SDGs 9 and 8 are the SDGs to which Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute. SDGs 9 and 8 are consecutively represented by two points above the upper whisker in the SDGs boxplot in Fig. 1 . Outliers  have a distinct position in the behavior of a variable in a sample distribution because their behavior significantly varies in comparison to other sample elements (i.e., data points). Considering that Degree Centrality variable reveals the prestige of information in an information network, the informational element (i.e., the data point) considered outlier should be highlighted in the analysis. Therefore, outliers above the upper whisker in Degree Centrality are prominent in their sample. In other words, SDGs 9 and 8 are above the upper whisker, revealing that there are significantly  more literature connections to these two SDGs than other SDGs. Considering the literature, Clarke (2020)  is the study that has more connections to the highest number of SDGs (i.e., 14) that a sampled study has in the sample. Each element (row) of the Tables 1 and 2  are nodes  in the information network developed using Gephi  software through the Fruchterman Reingold  algorithm. We generated Fig. 2   by considering the edges  identified, and categorized in the qualitative data analysis strand. Fig. 2  illustrates the information network connections. The green cluster represents the SDGs, and the red represents the sampled papers on Stakeholder Capitalism literature. The size and label names of nodes are aligned with their respective Degree Centrality. Therefore, NA revealed that Stakeholder Capitalism, as discussed in the literature, can contribute to achieving most SDGs, mainly SDG 9 and 8. However, no sampled studies indicate that Stakeholder Capitalism can promote SDG 15, and only one for SDGs 14 and 6. In essence, considering the construct of Stakeholder Capitalism , the qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to global governance in achieving the SDGs, mainly the SDGs 8, 9, and 17. As for both SDGs 8 and 9, the main reasons for Stakeholder Capitalism in helping to achieve these SDGs are because stakeholder cooperation and partnerships  can foster innovation and create value  for all stakeholders. In addition, stakeholder Capitalism includes a worker-friendly approach, shared economy, circular economy, transparent and accountable communication, healthy free market, entrepreneurship, sustainable supply and value chain, responsibility for sustainability issues, and ESG agenda implementation. Also, Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to achieving SDG 17 due to its main characteristic and strategic purpose - building consensus, stakeholder cooperation, and responsibility - in governance.   4.2 Discussion 4.2.1 The construct of Stakeholder Capitalism and the SDGs In this subsection, we establish the links on how Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by taking into account as units of analysis the SDGs and the six principles of the construct of Stakeholder Capitalism (Freeman et al., 2007 ). The Principle of Stakeholder Cooperation  is based on voluntary agreements among stakeholders to satisfy their needs and aspirations, and thus, value is created. In line with stakeholder cooperation, the Principle of Stakeholder Engagement  assumes that stakeholder engagement in organizational strategy is critical for creating sustained value for stakeholders. Our qualitative literature analysis (subsection 4.1.1) revealed that value creation had been created by stakeholder cooperation  and engagement  to foster sustainable development as a consequence of the SDGs' achievement (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Smith, 2010 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Ross and Crossan, 2012 ; Pärl, 2014 ; Arun and Babu, 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Watanabe et al., 2020 ; Thakhathi et al., 2021 ). Our analysis is aligned with the first proposition stated by Freudenreich et al. (2020)  for a stakeholder value creation framework, which points out that stakeholders are engaged  in fostering sustainable development. It reveals that achieving the SDGs and fostering sustainable development is in the interest of all stakeholders, at least most of them. In this way, Stakeholder Cooperation  and Stakeholder Engagement  also reveal the legitimacy  of sustainable development policies not only because stakeholders cooperate but also because there is consensus built in the governance behind it. The consensus  behind Stakeholder Cooperation  and Stakeholder Engagement  is also a source for building partnerships among stakeholders, which is helpful for SDG 17 (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Badaracco, 1998 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Wrigley and Currah, 2003 ; Andresani and Ferlie, 2006 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Pärl, 2014 ; Vogel, 2019 ; Arun and Babu, 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Coulter, 2020 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ). Additionally, the quantitative analysis (subsection 4.1.2) and qualitative literature analysis have reinforced that stakeholder cooperation and engagement are also sources of innovation and economic growth and are tied to SDGs 8 and 9. Considering the results of our analyses, this discussion, and the findings of Freudenreich et al. (2020) , we propose therefore that:Proposition 1a Stakeholder Cooperation and Stakeholder Engagement are elementary for Stakeholder Capitalism fostering sustainable development and contributing to the achievement of the SDGs.   Proposition 1b Stakeholder Cooperation and Stakeholder Engagement can be a driver for the global governance achieving SDG 17 once that consensus is reached and partnerships are made .  Proposition 1c Stakeholder Cooperation and Stakeholder Engagement can be a driver for the global governance achieving SDGs 8 and 9 once innovations and economic growth depend on stakeholders' actions .   The Principle of Stakeholder Responsibility  assumes that all stakeholders are conscious and accept the consequences of their actions. Stakeholders should have fair rights and duties, and thus, fair voluntary agreements should be made. This principle is also behind the ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’ construct discussed in subsection 4.2.2. As for achieving the SDGs, responsibility  is critical for organizational and societal awareness of social, economic, and environmental issues (Perkin, 1996 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Pieterse, 2003 ; Mcvea and Freeman, 2005 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Smith, 2010 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Ross and Crossan, 2012 ; Pärl, 2014 ; Alexander, 2019 ; Arun and Babu, 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Watanabe et al., 2020 ; Schwab and Vanham, 2021 ; Thakhathi et al., 2021 ). In this way, Stakeholder Capitalism promotes responsibility  simultaneously: (1) ending poverty, socio-economic inequality, and hungry, and providing essential services for all stakeholders, e.g., the SDGs 1 to 7, and 10; (2) fostering a decent innovative economy, i.e., the SDGs 8 to 11; (3) considering environmental issues, i.e., the SDGs 6, 7, and 11 to 15; and (4) assuring a consensual democratic society with strong institutions, and collaborative partnerships, i.e., SDGs 16 and 17. Responsibility  implies taking care of ourselves, society, and the environment. Thus, in all dimensions of sustainable development, responsibility  from all stakeholders is required. Therefore, we propose:Proposition 2a Stakeholder Responsibility denotes behavioral and attitudinal consciousness, which implies fair rights and duties from all stakeholders, promotes sustainable development policies, and contributes to the achievement of the SDGs.   Proposition 2b Stakeholder Responsibility is based on recognizing that stakeholders should act to take care of themselves and the environment, thus fostering sustainable development through stakeholder partnerships (SDG 17).    The Principle of Complexity  is based on Human Psychology complexity. This complexity results from multiple cultures, values, and points of view as well as multiple social contexts and social milieus . In this way, Stakeholder Capitalism also promotes respect and coexistence among different stakeholders and backgrounds. Consensus , as discussed with Stakeholder Cooperation  and Engagement  principles, is also critical for managing the systemic complexity, i.e., social, economic, and environmental systems (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Badaracco, 1998 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Freeman and Phillips, 2002 ; Wrigley and Currah, 2003 ; Andresani and Ferlie, 2006 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Pärl, 2014 ; Vogel, 2019 ; Arun and Babu, 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Coulter, 2020 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ; Fama, 2021 ). Our results also revealed that consensus  in the systemic complexity promoted in Stakeholder Capitalism  could help foster peace and strengthen justice and democratic institutions. Moreover, it is useful for reducing societal conflicts and promoting a self-reflected, altruistic, and supportive culture. In this way, we propose that:Proposition 3 Stakeholder Capitalism promotes an altruistic culture needed for managing systemic complexity by building consensus among stakeholders, promoting peace and democratic values, and thus, helping to achieve SDG 16 through the Stakeholder Complexity principle.    The Principle of Continuous Creation  of Stakeholder Capitalism is critical for socio-economic progress, innovation, and organizations' survival when facing new challenges and scenarios. As presented in the results, stakeholder-orientation matters for innovation and new ways of creating value (Perkin, 1996 ; Freeman and Liedtka, 1997 ; Sunley, 1999 ; Gilmartin and Freeman, 2002 ; Mcvea and Freeman, 2005 ; Freeman et al., 2007 ; Ochieng, 2008 ; Smith, 2010 ; Petrick, 2011 ; Ross and Crossan, 2012 ; Pärl, 2014 ; Arun and Babu, 2020 ; Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ; Watanabe et al., 2020 ; Thakhathi et al., 2021 ), which help achieve SDGs 8 and 9. Therefore, Continuous Creation  is crucial for improving the ways of meeting stakeholder needs. Indeed, this principle should be aligned with other principles of Stakeholder Capitalism as the principle of Responsibility . For instance, organizations and society should innovate by considering optimized use of resources, avoiding resource waste, and taking care of the environment. Also, Continuous Creation  is empowered in simultaneously cooperative and competitive environments of free-market. In this way, there is also the Principle of Emergent Competition , which assumes that the free market is a cornerstone of value creation and society's economic prosperity. Of course, the free market is also a basis of Shareholder Capitalism. However, the goal of the free market is to create value and satisfy the needs of stakeholders. Also, Emergent Competition  is theoretically considered of the same importance as the other principles, such as Responsibility , Cooperation , Engagement, Continuous Creation , and Complexity . Therefore, Continuous Creation  in Emergent Competition  markets can contribute to the global governance to achieve both SDGs 8 and 9. Thus, we propose that:Proposition 4 Responsible Continuous Creation and Emergent Competition are fundamentals of innovation, socio-economic progress, and new ways of satisfying the needs of stakeholders, and thus could help to achieve both the SDGs 8 and 9.    Overall, all the six principles of Stakeholder Capitalism are jointly and simultaneously important for global governance achieving enhanced sustainable development patterns, and thus, the SDGs. In this way, our discussion is also aligned with the stakeholder value creation framework proposed by Freudenreich et al. (2020) , in which stakeholder engagement, shared purpose, alignment of stakeholder interests, and integration of ethical issues matter. Although not excluding, all the principles of Stakeholder Capitalism should be considered at the same time and with the same importance. Counterbalancing these stakeholder principles among stakeholders can be challenging since stakeholders have a complex and dynamic nature and salience. Thus, we agree with Freeman et al. (2007, p. 312)  that “... there will always be a small minority who are focused on their own self-interest at the expense of others”. Therefore, these principles of Stakeholder Capitalism can, at least, help avoid the worst socio-economic and environmental results in the capitalist system. For instance, these principles of Stakeholder Capitalism can help foster more sustainable socio-economic and environmental systems.  4.2.2 Other constructs of Stakeholder Theory and the SDGs In this subsection, we go further the research purpose and the construct of stakeholder capitalism by exploring other remarkable constructs of Stakeholder Theory. Here, we concisely explored how the following constructs which are interrelated to Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to global governance to achieve the SDGs: (1) Stakeholder; (2) Stakeholder Salience and its main four attributes, i.e., power, urgency, legitimacy, and proximity; (3) Corporate Social Responsibility; and (4) Value Creation. The Construct of Stakeholder . ‘Stakeholders’ are mainly defined as “who can affect or are affected by the achievement of an organization's purpose” by Freeman (1984, p. 49) , which is the classic definition for the construct of ‘stakeholder’. This construct is mostly used in stakeholder identification. Concerning Stakeholder Capitalism, stakeholders are theoretically the cornerstone of corporate strategy. The qualitative analysis of this research shows that classic stakeholder types are concerned with achieving SDGs, such as citizens, communities, civil society, governments, the international community, academia, and industry. However, the environment - as a non-human stakeholder - in the terms proposed by Phillips and Reichart (2000)  should also be considered in Stakeholder Capitalism. Unfortunately, it is missing to integrate the environment as an essential stakeholder in Stakeholder Capitalism: Much of the literature discussed in the qualitative analysis reveals that Stakeholder Capitalism has more to contribute to SDGs related to human stakeholders than to non-human stakeholders. For instance, SDGs 14 and 15 - related to life below water and on land - have received little attention from scholars on stakeholder capitalism. Therefore, Stakeholder Capitalism could be benefited if - the environment and non-human stakeholders - were considered in organizational strategy and in governmental policy-making since these stakeholders are remarkable for sustainable development transition. The Construct of Stakeholder Salience . Mitchell et al. (1997)  proposed the construct of stakeholder salience for revealing the importance and visibility of a stakeholder type as perceived (and prioritized) by organizational leaders. This construct considers the extent to which the stakeholders' attributes of power , legitimacy , urgency , and proximity  are perceived by managers (Mitchell et al., 1997 ; Driscoll and Starik, 2004 ; Agle et al., 1999 ). Power, legitimacy,  and urgency  are stakeholder attributes vastly explored in management studies. In turn, proximity  is a stakeholder salience attribute initially proposed by Driscoll and Starik (2004) , which can be useful also for contexts in which there are non-human stakeholders but not limited to it. Proximity  considers - the environment - either in terms of the geographical distance of physical space (Driscoll and Starik, 2004 ) or the social distance among stakeholders (Lähdesmäki et al., 2019 ). According to Schwab and Vanham (2021) , Stakeholder Capitalism tries to equalize the power  among stakeholders. However, equalizing power among stakeholders as proposed in the construct of Stakeholder Capitalism is challenging to be achieved if we consider the construct of Stakeholder Salience: The reason is that - power varies - over time in geographical distance, social distance, and among different stakeholders (Mitchell et al., 1997 ; Agle et al., 1999 ), building check and balance mechanisms for equalizing stakeholders' power is a hard-task. In this way, although perfect power  equality among stakeholders can be considered impossible to be reached, our qualitative analysis reveals what can be done in Stakeholder Capitalism to make an equal society. Therefore, our qualitative analysis reveals that: First, designing organizational and governmental policies and strategies in which the concept of - inclusive and community capitalism - should be embedded in the socio-economic and environmental strategy of Stakeholder Capitalism. Inclusive capitalism matters because it not only helps decrease the stakeholder power inequality but also helps achieve some SDGs. Indeed, SDG 10 is related to the purpose of Stakeholder Capitalism, which is to equalize the power in the relationship among stakeholders to the extent it can be possible. Second, Stakeholder Capitalism has an inclusive approach by strengthening the idea of gender equality (SDG 5) and equal accessibility in terms of financial, material, and service resources for communities and citizens in a free-market society (e.g., SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10). However, the power inequality  will always be a challenge for the Stakeholder Capitalism purpose since the socio-economic and environmental issues, stakeholder complex interplay relations, and contexts constantly change over time. Therefore, new strategies and flexibility to new paradigms should always be considered by practitioners, organizations, and governments to ensure the best measures for equalizing power in Stakeholder Capitalism. As for the stakeholder salience attribute of legitimacy , there are three main points highlighted by our qualitative analysis for SDGs achievement: First, the claims of unions and workers' cooperatives should be considered for building a society with decent work and economic growth, i.e., SDG 8. In this sense, as stakeholder capitalism is based on meeting stakeholders' needs and workforce engagement in organizational strategy, unions and workers' cooperatives play critical roles in achieving SDG 8. However, it is not clear whether Stakeholder Capitalism has assured workforce engagement in strategic organizational management. For this reason, one measure that can help improve Stakeholder Capitalism in this matter is to emphasize the role of accountability and disclosure of data and reports (Chouaibi and Affes, 2021 ; Aluchna et al., 2022 ; Chouaibi et al., 2022 ). In this matter, the challenge is that disclosure should not only result from stakeholder salience (Aluchna et al., 2022 ) but also be institutionalized in norms and laws for all stakeholders. Therefore, accountability can help the workforce, civil society, and other interested stakeholders in labor issues to ensure that workers have their ‘stake’ in organizational strategy. Second, legitimacy  is behind societal and industrial innovation, and legitimacy  is an instrument for stakeholder collaboration. Once a stakeholder considers an organization and other systemic stakeholders to have ‘proper or appropriate’ claims, it will be easier to create collaboration among stakeholders. In this way, the salience attribute of legitimacy  can be a source for fostering the achievement of SDG 8. Therefore, practitioners of businesses, the third sector, academia, and governments can explore the salience attribute of legitimacy  for building partnerships and enhancing their innovation potential. And third, as legitimacy  is the quality of ‘proper or appropriateness’ of stakeholder claims in socially constructed systems (e.g., beliefs and norms) (Mitchell et al., 1997 ; Agle et al., 1999 ), laws and regulations play a critical role in deciding what is legitimate or not (Petrick, 2011 ; Clarke, 2020 ). In this way, laws and regulations should assure legal stability and protection of the rights and duties of stakeholders by regulating limits for industrial and state activities, which is vital for building solid legal institutions (SDG 16). The legal limits should consider the whole socio-economic and environmental systems in sustainable terms, e.g., by implementing the ‘3-D Sustainability’ approach for priority setting in decision-making processes (Mauerhofer, 2008 ; Mauerhofer, 2019 ). It means that in Stakeholder Capitalism, a free market should exist besides social development and environmental protection. An existing measure is the social and environmental operating licenses (Petrick, 2011 ; Clarke, 2020 ). The challenge for legal systems in Stakeholder Capitalism is to build fair legislation in which the social, economic, and environmental dimensions are equally considered necessary. Therefore, policy-makers in Stakeholder Capitalism should consider aiming to make: fair regulations and policies for assuring a humanized free market; optimal patterns of socio-economic equality and development; and efficient environmental management and protection. As for urgency , time and immediate attention from stakeholders matters (Mitchell et al., 1997 ; Agle et al., 1999 ). In this sense, the United Nations aimed for the SDGs to be achieved by 2030. In other words, there is a conscience of - time and urgency - concerning the SDGs. It is marked by socio-economic and environmental challenges in globalization, the fourth industrial revolution, and climate change. Although the SDGs are universal, the urgency  of some SDGs for stakeholders can vary depending upon the local and regional context, in which local stakeholders will have different backgrounds, urgent topics, and local needs (Beck and Storopoli, 2021 ).For instance, as for SDG 1, poverty is an issue that should be ended indistinctly in all countries. However, countries with a higher poverty index can perceive ending poverty as more urgent than countries with a lower poverty index. Certainly, it does not mean countries with lower poverty index will ignore SDG 1. Additionally, considering that the environment - as a non-human stakeholder - also varies around the world (e.g., geographic characteristics, green-gas house emission, soil types, and weather), each local will require different approaches on how to manage accommodative policies to achieve the SDGs (mainly the SDGs 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15). The bottom line is that urgency  is a complex salience attribute of stakeholders, which can vary according to different stakeholders and contexts, mainly at the local and regional levels. Therefore, the challenge for Stakeholder Capitalism in helping to achieve the SDGs, in terms of urgency , is: first, to assure that all SDGs will be considered for stakeholders at the regional and local levels even if some topics be higher demanded than others; and second, to emphasize the need of local communities, regions, and countries to meet their primary concerns of which are related to the SDGs, so that other SDGs of topics considered no urgent by them will also not be ignored. As proximity  can be either geographic-oriented or socially-oriented, the SDGs to which stakeholder proximity  in Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to involving cities, regions, countries, and the development of network relationships. In other words, the attribute of proximity hypothetically can contribute to SDG 11 on ‘sustainable cities and communities’ and SDG 17 on ‘partnerships to achieve the goal’. There is an opportunity for scholars to explore further the role of stakeholder proximity  in cities and regions for building sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) and partnerships to achieve all SDGs (SDG 17). This opportunity is relevant since higher degrees of proximity among stakeholders are associated with a higher synergy of emotional connection, values, and commitment among stakeholders (Lähdesmäki et al., 2019 ). If systemic governance is engaged in the principles of sustainable development, stakeholder proximity  could be hypothetically a factor behind this synergy. Furthermore, practitioners could explore their proximity  with their stakeholders to strengthen ties, create partnerships for sustainable development projects, and foster sustainable societies. Therefore, stakeholder proximity  is a critical driver for improving the relationships among stakeholders, which can be used in managing projects and strategizing policies related to sustainable development (and the SDGs). The Construct of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) . Although “there is not a single widely accepted definition of CSR” (Freeman et al., 2010 , p. 235), the core assumption of CSR is that: Corporations have not only duties and rights toward the owners and stockholders but also they have responsibilities toward the society, the community, and the public realm as a whole (Carroll, 1991 ; Carroll, 1999 ; Carroll and Buchholtz, 2009 ; Freeman et al., 2010 ). CSR is an umbrella construct analyzed in diverse organizational contexts, such as social performance, social responsiveness, citizenship, governance, accountability, sustainability, and social entrepreneurship. The bottom line for our topic is that stakeholder theory and CSR has been valid in promoting sustainability and sustainable development (ElAlfy et al., 2020a ; ElAlfy et al., 2020b ; Rendtorff, 2020 ; Nurunnabi et al., 2020 ; Mishra, 2021 ; Shayan et al., 2022 ). In this way, the literature and results have also shown that CSR can be useful for ending/reducing poverty and hunger (SDGs 1 and 2), promoting health and education (SDGs 3 and 4), clean energy (SDG 7), reducing inequality (SDG 10), as well as promoting decent work (SDG 8) by promoting ethics in the supply chain, and in the actions/principles of the businesses. Therefore, CSR is useful for achieving the SDGs. However, organizational accountability and disclosure are still needed to legitimize CSR-related actions (Chouaibi and Affes, 2021 ; Aluchna et al., 2022 ; Cezarino et al., 2022 ; Chouaibi et al., 2022 ). The Construct of Value Creation . Creating value means satisfying the needs of one or more stakeholders (Brickson, 2007 ; Freeman et al., 2010 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ). On the one hand, the classic business model perspective focuses mainly on what kind of value is created, how the business creates the value and the extent to which the value is created for customers (Freudenreich et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, the Stakeholder Theory perspective highlights with whom and for whom the value is created (Brickson, 2007 ; Freeman et al., 2010 ; Harrison et al., 2010 ; Bridoux and Stoelhorst, 2016 ; Tantalo and Priem, 2014 ; Freudenreich et al., 2020 ). Moreover, our results are aligned with the propositions made by Freudenreich et al. (2020)  for a stakeholder value creation framework, in which stakeholders in terms of organizational policies for sustainability: (1) are engaged; (2) have a common purpose; (3) have aligned their interests; and (4) and ethical concerns integrated. In this way, our qualitative analysis revealed that stakeholders had these four items of the stakeholder value creation framework for improving essential services and products for achieving the SDGs. For instance, the stakeholder value creation framework proposed by Freudenreich et al. (2020)  improves and promotes: health systems (SDG 3); educational systems (SDG 4); water and sanitation systems (SDG 6); infrastructural, industrial, and economic systems (SDGs 8 and 9); sustainable smart cities and communities (SDG 11); sustainable and responsible production and supply chains (SDG 12); partnerships to the achievement of the SDGs (SDG 17). Therefore, all stakeholders benefit from the stakeholder model of value creation  since it not only improves all the socio-economic and environmental systems but also it drives the systemic policies toward sustainable development at local, regional, and international levels. In this section, we discussed some theoretical and practical implications in light of the primary constructs developed in the Stakeholder Theory. Although the research aims to explore the construct of - stakeholder capitalism - as a contributor to global governance to achieve the SDGs, exploring these constructs is helpful since Stakeholder Capitalism is interrelated to these other constructs of Stakeholder Theory.    5 Conclusions In order to achieve our research purpose, we performed qualitative and quantitative analyses and discussed the construct of Stakeholder Capitalism by revisiting its six principles. Our results and discussion pointed out that Stakeholder Capitalism can contribute to achieving the SDGs, mainly SDGs 8, 9, and 17. The less addressed SDGs in the Stakeholder Capitalism literature were the SDGs 6, 14, and 15 related to the environment and non-human stakeholders. Although Stakeholder Capitalism does not solve all global and local issues, it can foster enhanced sustainable development patterns at all levels. Indeed, the six principles of Stakeholder Capitalism are jointly and simultaneously critical for promoting sustainable development and, thus, for achieving the SDGs. In this way, the main research findings revealed that: (1) Stakeholder Cooperation  and Stakeholder Engagement  matter for reaching stakeholder consensus, constituting partnerships, fostering innovation, and creating value for stakeholders; (2) Stakeholder Responsibility  denotes stakeholder consciousness and implies the promotion of sustainable development policies and stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development; (3) Stakeholder Complexity  builds consensus among stakeholders and promotes peace and democratic values; and (4) Responsible Continuous Creation  and Emergent Competition  enhance sustainable development, innovation, and new ways of satisfying stakeholders' needs. Therefore, although Stakeholder Capitalism does not address all socio-economic and environmental issues, it can foster sustainable development and thus, help achieve the SDGs. Our research also revealed additional interesting findings and practical and theoretical implications. Stakeholder Capitalism is a construct of Stakeholder Theory, which relates to other constructs, such as, stakeholder concept, stakeholder salience, CSR, and value creation. In this direction, our research findings suggested that: (1) the environment  and non-human stakeholders  should be incorporated as part of the stakeholder construct  because these stakeholders are remarkable for sustainable development transition; (2) considering the power  attribute of stakeholder salience , new strategies and flexibility to new paradigms matter for equalizing the power  of stakeholders; (3) considering the legitimacy  attribute of stakeholder salience , accountability matters for assuring that stakeholders have their ‘stake’ in organizational strategy; (4) legitimacy  is critical for building partnerships, enhancing innovations, and fostering sustainable development regulations and policies; (5) urgency  can help practitioners to identify and consider local and regional issues to foster sustainable development, but it does not mean that urgent global topics should be ignored; (6) stakeholder proximity  can improve stakeholder interplays and help to strategize sustainable development policies; (7) CSR is useful for achieving the SDGs, but accountability and disclosure are still needed to legitimize  CSR programs; and (8) the stakeholder value creation model promotes sustainable development policies of socio-economic and environmental systems at local, regional, and international levels. The suggestions for further studies are: (1) developing theoretically and empirically studies for the targets and indicators of each SDG concerning Stakeholder Capitalism; (2) exploring the importance of sustainable issues for many distinct stakeholders within the value creation process and in global governance by case studies around the world; (3) investigating different ways in which the selfishness culture prevalent in Shareholder Capitalism can be shifted to the altruism culture in Stakeholder Capitalism societies in order to focus on creating long-term value (e.g., Clarke, 2020 ; 2010; Grove et al., 2020 ; Mhlanga and Moloi, 2020 ); (4) investigating possible characteristics of Stakeholder Capitalism that could be considered in a universal replicable model and that allows higher coordination capacity of governance in local stakeholder partnerships (Sunley, 1999 ); (5) exploring stakeholder-based measures and policies that mitigate inequality and impede inequality reinforcement (Sunley, 1999 ); (6) understanding in-depth the Stakeholder Capitalism in a circular economy (Clarke, 2020 ; Grove et al., 2020 ); (7) to explore how the cost could be lower in responsible consumption and production in Stakeholder Capitalism supply chains (Ochieng, 2008 ; Smith, 2010 ; Fama, 2021 ); (8) replicating the methodological procedures used for ‘cross-network literature analysis’ for increasing validity and reliability; (9) exploring and even comparing stakeholder capitalism with shareholder capitalism on how they contribute to moving the world toward sustainable development; (10) exploring stakeholder capitalism in the emergent context of smart sustainable cities (Corsi et al., 2022 ); (11) exploring in-depth how and to what extent the Stakeholder Capitalism construct can contribute to achieving the SDGs 6, 14, and 15; (12) exploring the legal structures of stakeholder-oriented strategies for achieving SDG 16 at the local, regional, national, and international levels (Hubacek and Mauerhofer, 2008 ); and (13) to explore the six principles of stakeholder capitalism regarding to the methods, contexts, and converging theories. Additionally, this research offered a new qualitative-quantitative procedure for analyzing data via NA by including a categorization that preceded the quantitative analysis. This procedure allowed the identification of nodes and edges formed in the network that represents what papers could better contribute to a specific SDG and which SDG is receiving more attention from academia. We recommend further developing these methodological procedures in future literature reviews/bibliographic studies. Among limitations, this study is based on the ideas and interpretations of the authors concerning the links between Stakeholder Capitalism literature and SDGs. Therefore, different analyses conducted by different authors may differ from these findings/interpretations. Another limitation relates to the understanding through unique methodologies, such as the ‘cross-network literature analysis’ used in this study.
