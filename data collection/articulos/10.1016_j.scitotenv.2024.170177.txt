                  The present study evaluated sustainable development indicators of the Nekarood Watershed in Iran using global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators. Identifying values and thresholds, justification of optimum values, ranking, and performance assessment of the associated SDGs' indicators were accordingly addressed. Moreover, due to a lack of complete information and ecological conditions, 77 indicators were selected based on compliance with the indicators of global SDGs. These indicators were used to evaluate the development situation of the study area. The indicators were then normalized, weighed, aggregated, and ranked into four categories from achieving to highly challenging. The results showed that among the SDGs, five goals performed above the mean of the global sustainable development goals. So, goals 3 and 1 had the highest performance of 69.82 and 57.97 %, respectively. Likewise, goals 7 and 16 showed the lowest performance beyond the global average of 51.08 and 54.62 %, respectively. SDG3-1-1, SDG3-1-2, SDG3-2-1, and SDG3-2-2 indicators with 100 % performance positively affected SDG3. SDG1-5-1 indicator with 100 % performance also had the most positive effect on SDG1. The performances of nine goals were also lower than the global mean. In this case, the lowest performance was assigned to goal 2, followed by goals 9, 17, 10, and 6, respectively, with 15.24, 19.71, 22.19, 24.98, and 45.78 %. SDG2-4-2, SDG2-4-1, and SDG2-3-1 indicators had the most negative effect on the performance of SDG2. SDG9-2-2 and SDG10-4-1 indicators also had the most negative effect on goals 9 and 10, respectively. The highest performance of the indicators was associated with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, and the lowest was related to the Ministries of Agriculture Jihad and the Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade. The results of the present study verified an overall performance of 36.42 % for the Nekarood Watershed concerning the global SDGs, representing significantly challenging conditions.

Editor: Ashantha Goonetilleke The present study evaluated sustainable development indicators of the Nekarood Watershed in Iran using global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators. Identifying values and thresholds, justification of optimum values, ranking, and performance assessment of the associated SDGs' indicators were accordingly addressed. Moreover, due to a lack of complete information and ecological conditions, 77 indicators were selected based on compliance with the indicators of global SDGs. These indicators were used to evaluate the development situation of the study area. The indicators were then normalized, weighed, aggregated, and ranked into four categories from achieving to highly challenging. The results showed that among the SDGs, five goals performed above the mean of the global sustainable development goals. So, goals 3 and 1 had the highest performance of 69.82 and 57.97 %, respectively. Likewise, goals 7 and 16 showed the lowest performance beyond the global average of 51.08 and 54.62 %, respectively. SDG3-1-1, SDG3-1-2, SDG3-2-1, and SDG3-2-2 indicators with 100 % performance positively affected SDG3. SDG1-5-1 indicator with 100 % performance also had the most positive effect on SDG1. The performances of nine goals were also lower than the global mean. In this case, the lowest performance was assigned to goal 2, followed by goals 9, 17, 10, and 6, respectively, with 15.24, 19.71, 22.19, 24.98, and 45.78 %. SDG2-4-2, SDG2-4-1, and SDG2-3-1 indicators had the most negative effect on the performance of SDG2. SDG9-2-2 and SDG10-4-1 indicators also had the most negative effect on goals 9 and 10, respectively. The highest performance of the indicators was associated with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, and the lowest was related to the Ministries of Agriculture Jihad and the Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade. The results of the present study verified an overall performance of 36.42 % for the Nekarood Watershed concerning the global SDGs, representing significantly challenging conditions.

These crises have been made worse by policy-makers' ignorance of the problems associated with watersheds and their refusal to provide adequate funds (Abdul Malaki et al., 2023 ; Najafi, 2015 ; Sadeghi et al., 2023 ). Soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, water, soil, air pollution, and biodiversity loss will all worsen (Farashiani et al., 2023 ; Dehmardeh et al., 2023 ). They may also have contributed to many economic and social problems, such as economic instability, overexploitation and high consumption of various resources, unemployment, poverty, hunger, failure to ensure people's health and welfare, social injustice, tyrannies, migration, poor education, gender inequality, lack of access to clean energy, deteriorated residential structures, and a lack of public involvement in watershed management projects (Todaro and Smith, 2020 ; Janabi Namin and Nowruzzadeh, 2023 ). These issues may overshadow the short- and long-term goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Sachs et al., 2022 ). Numerous perspectives on the responsible and sustainable use of natural and human resources have been advanced internationally due to the development of these issues and the continuance of environmental catastrophes (Surya et al., 2020 ; Jhariya et al., 2022 ;). In this way, watershed management has been introduced as a comprehensive and appropriate approach to the sustainable governance of ecosystems (Mohammadi Golrang et al., 2015 ). The watershed includes various economic, social, infrastructural, and environmental ecosystems and is considered the optimal unit for sustainable governance of regional ecosystems (Montgomery et al., 1995 ). Watershed management has been introduced as a comprehensive and suitable approach for governing sustainable ecosystems (Mohammadi Golrang et al., 2015 ). Its fundamental role and importance lie in conserving water and soil resources, biodiversity (Romero Diaz et al., 2019 ), and provisioning goods and services for diverse ecosystems (Daily et al., 2000 ). From an economic and social perspective, ecosystem goods and services directly and indirectly contribute to societal well-being, economic prosperity, fulfilling needs, and human livelihoods (Ronchi, 2018 ). The World Bank also views watershed governance as encompassing hydrological considerations, optimal resource utilization, achieving goods and services, recognizing the relationship between upstream and downstream areas (Nearly, 2000 ), and achieving true sustainability in natural resources (Guangyu et al., 2016 ). Therefore, employing a watershed governance model can be beneficial to attain sustainable development goals and move beyond the environmental, economic, and social impacts and inefficiencies of both formal and informal institutions within countries (Ayouzi et al., 2016 ). Considering the complexity and multidimensionality of the economic, social, environmental, infrastructural, institutional, and political circumstances in the watersheds, comprehensive and integrated governance is necessary to integrate the aspects mentioned earlier appropriately (Sadeghi et al., 2021 ; Talebi et al., 2022 ). Water management's primary role and importance are protecting water, soil resources, biodiversity (Romero Diaz et al., 2019 ), and the supply of goods and services to different ecosystems (Daily et al., 2000 ). From an economic and social point of view, the goods and services of ecosystems, directly and indirectly, contribute to social welfare and economic prosperity and meet human needs and livelihood (Ronchi, 2018 ). In order to achieve sustainability in natural resources, the World Bank's perspective on watershed governance also includes adherence to hydrological issues, the best use of resources, access to goods and services, and recognition of the relationship between Montgomery's upstream and downstream areas (Nearly, 2000 ). As a result, sustainable governance ought to be employed rather than good governance. In order to achieve the SDGs and manage the environmental repercussions, this change is required to overcome the obstacles given by insufficient native local conditions, historical and cultural contexts, and ineffective official and informal institutions of countries. This aims to reach a balanced, sustainable development (SD) of societies by 2030 (Ayouzi et al., 2016 ). The phrase “a balanced sustainable development (SD) of societies” was initially introduced in 1987 by “Brentland” in the “Our Common Future” report (UN, 1987 ). According to Rad et al. (2017) , this kind of development is an example of economic, social, structural, and environmental changes that can meet the requirements of the present generation and those of the next generation. As a result, countries' ability to maintain a sustainable way of life is seriously threatened by economic growth without considering social and environmental factors (Mosaffaie and Salehpour Jam, 2018 ). The ecological component, which considers the welfare of all species on Earth, is frequently the focal point of SD (Abdul Malaki et al., 2023 ; Mousavi Davijani et al., 2023 ). The annual report on the sustainable development goals of countries, using the latest available data and estimates based on the 2030 agenda, is prepared and published by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. The report identifies crises affecting the lives and livelihoods of specific people and areas for progress and emphasizes that all Sustainable Development Goals are interrelated and must be achieved together (Sachs et al., 2022 ). According to Zamani and Javaherian (2015)  and Expediency Council (2019) , the status or performance of SD can be assessed using sustainability indicators. The SDI is one of the indicators of the global SDGs. These SDIs fundamentally differ from conventional, purely arbitrary economic, social, and environmental indicators, lacking a coherent set and logical order. Traditional indicators lack a set of integrated indicators and cross-sectoral links in all dimensions of development. There needs to be more logical and structural order in designating the index system and its measurement. In contrast, the SDI framework provides a comprehensive set of indicators in all dimensions of development (i.e., economic, social, and environmental), considers predictive cross-sectoral connections and effects in the process of proposing indicators, employs a logical and structural manner in designing the index system and associated measurement, and ultimately explains processes in an integrated way. In other words, SDIs are comprehensive, predictive, and distributional because the indicator framework is not arbitrary and depicts the relationships between the various sustainable development components. The study metrics have been designated based on various standards, frameworks and consensus developed by international organizations (e.g., UN, 1987, 2019 ; UNECEF, 2018 ; UNICEF, 2019 ; UNSTATES, 2020 ; UNESCO-UIS, 2021 ; WHO, 2021 ; UNESCO, 2022a, 2022b, 2022c ; UN-Habitat, 2021a, 2021b ; UNICEF, 2022 ; World Bank, 2022a, 2022b ; UNDP, 2023 ; UNEP, 2023a, 2023b ; UNESCO, 2023 ; UN-Habitat, 2023 ; UN-Water, 2023 ; UNICEF, 2023 ; UNIDO and ILO, 2023 ; UNODC and WHO, 2023 ; UNWTO, 2023 ; WHO et al., 2023 ; World Bank Education Statistics, 2023 ; World Bank, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c, 2023d, 2023e, 2023f, 2023g ; World Economic Forum, 2023 ) without operational or structural flaws. Sustainable development indicators (SDIs) offer data on numerous SD dimensions for planners and decision-makers. They can also coherently transmit a variety of economic, social, and environmental processes to the policy-making levels (Zamani and Javaherian, 2015 ), facilitating decision-making and assessing how far societies have come toward achieving sustainability. In order to prevent economic, social, and environmental harm, early warnings can be given to decision-making levels (Pourasghar Sangajin et al., 2014 ; Mikulčić et al., 2019 ). Even though the problems two countries face are identical, the SDI evaluates the current state of affairs in light of each nation's aims and future possibilities. This is because the two nations have distinct development objectives. An example of this situation is related to Malaysia. Malaysia reduced its absolute poverty rate from >50 % in 1960 to <0.3 % at the end of 2016 by compiling and properly implementing 11 development programs. So, it was ranked 61st in the global sustainable development performance of 2021 and achieved high performance in all economic, social, and environmental dimensions. It provided economic growth and good personal well-being for its people as well. Besides that, it upgraded from a low-income country to a high-income industrialized country in <40 years. Four significant SDIs have drawn attention in international forums to evaluate SD. These indicators include the SDGs, the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), the Sustainable Development Commission (CSD), and the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). The SDGs for 2015 to 2030 have replaced MDG, CSD and EPI indicators. This is due to the unsustainable development of the CSD, MDG, and EPI, the lack of participation from all stakeholders in the compilation of these indicators, the lack of a shared commitment, the disregard for previously agreed development goals, the indicators' simplification and impossibility, their inconsistency with national needs, the ambiguity surrounding the parties responsible, and the neglect of environmental issues, particularly climate change (Fehling et al., 2013 ; Zamani and Javaherian, 2015 ). Accordingly, some nations (e.g., Albania, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, and Iran) have accepted establishing a new global development framework at the Rio + 20 UN Development Conference 2012. This framework, called “The Future We Want,” strongly emphasized the creation of the SDGs and the post-2015 development agenda. The framework has 169 aims and 17 targets (Hák et al., 2016 ). Several studies (e.g., Bota-Avram et al., 2018 ; Khalatbari and Dadashpour, 2022 ; Zahiri et al., 2022 ) have been carried out based on the SDGs' specified indicators. However, the classic, purely arbitrary economic, social, and environmental indices are frequently used in these investigations. Consequently, they cannot show the connection between various SD elements, such as the SDG indicators. In other words, these indicators have yet to be chosen correctly and entirely following the indicators of SDG. For instance, the bidirectional correlation between country-level governance, economic growth, and SD was also researched by Bota-Avram et al. (2018) . They employed three important indicators in their research—Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Adjusted Net Savings (ANS), and Gross National Income (GNI)—and showed how inconsistent the ANS indicator was with the SDI. Additionally, Indicators of per capita income, financial development, inflation rate, rent of natural resources, and time spent on sustainable development were utilized by Koirala and Pradhan (2020)  for 12 Asian nations. Their findings demonstrated the importance of preserving the equilibrium of natural resources for sustainable development. Omri and Mabrouk (2020)  employed three indicators: human development (HDI), carbon dioxide emissions (CO2 ), and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The SDG indicators and the HDI index did not coincide in their research. The indices of population growth rate, urban population density, and rural population density were employed by Khalatbari and Dadashpour (2022)  to determine social criteria. They employed economic criteria or indicators of employment rate, annual income, access to urban areas, and the Kanara extra-regional axis. For the environmental criterion, the indicators include soil type, water resource quality, access to the surface water network, access to lands with agricultural and forest value, distance from faults, and distance from places at threat of flooding. According to the findings, the eight indicators—population growth rate, urban and rural population densities, access to extra-region, soil type, land slope, distance from faults, and flood-prone areas—were not chosen as global sustainability development indicators. Peace, diplomacy, and international collaboration are acknowledged as essential preconditions for global development in the SDG framework (Sachs et al., 2022 ). It views these components as crucial and practical in boosting economic and social welfare. Zahiri et al. (2022)  also examined how practical governance's political, social, and economic aspects influenced certain countries' SDs. In this regard, they used the indicators of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Geneva Capital Group (GCG), the Poverty Headcount Ratio at national poverty lines (PHR), the Gini Coefficient (GIC), the Fixed Capital Fund (FCF), the Energy Intensity of Labour (EIL), the Human Development Index (HDI), and the Environmental Performance Index (EPI). The results showed that the FCF and HDI indicators do not align with the indicators of global SDGs. Furthermore, Pourebrahim et al. (2023)  used resource consumption in industries, water consumption in agriculture, and pollution from industries and household use to analyze environmental carrying capacity based on the ecological footprint for the sustainable development of Alborz, Iran. The findings showed that imbalanced land development, the removal of protected areas, and changes in land-use continue to favour industrial and residential development in the research area. Similarly, Sadiq et al. (2023)  emphasized the importance of environmental, social, governance, and economic indicators in meeting ASEAN countries' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The literature review showed that the MDGs, CSD, and EPI indicators have structural limitations, but they have been utilized in many studies with conventional economic, social, and environmental indicators (Zamani and Javaherian, 2015 ). However, employing metrics supporting the global SDGs and concentrating on their guiding principles—such as social inclusion, sustainable energy, responsible consumption, and access to public services—has not yet received enough attention to tackle today's urgent problems. The SDGs should, therefore, continue to serve as a roadmap for achieving SD by 2030 and beyond. As a result, before beginning any planning, it is essential to analyze and assess the resource condition using the SDG indicators (Makhdoum, 2022 ). In that case, the development is expected to be sustainable and balanced at the world, national, and regional levels. Scrutinizing accessible documents verified that no elaborative and comprehensive studies have been conducted to assess the concomitance of the current development conditions in a particular area compared to global UN-SDGs. At the same time, it is vital for sound spatial planning to utilize diminishing resources sustainably. It is further essential in developing countries where development takes place carelessly to fulfill over-demands. The intermediate state of health and ecological security of the second-order watersheds in Iran, recently reported by Sadeghi et al. (2023) , also necessitated a further assessment of governing situations in the watersheds to strive for reasonable, holistic, and applicable managerial strategies to retard perpetuating degradation of the resources in Iran. Accordingly, the current study was formulated to determine the SD status of the Nekarood Watershed as a representative for most of the degrading watershed in northern Iran and to use the best indicators that are entirely congruent with the SDG indicators. The distance between the goals and the overall ideal scenario was calculated, and the indicators and goals were divided into four groups. It was, therefore, hypothesized that the current governing conditions in the study watershed were below the global mean SDG standards. The procedure and study methodology can be employed for similar assessments in other regions to provide the appropriate roadmap to help decision-makers reorient the existing management strategies on watershed resources.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The Nakarood Watershed, ca 1905 km2 , 22 km south of the Caspian Sea, was selected as a study area due to the special instability conditions ruling it and numerous floods over the last few years (Ebrahimi et al., 2013 ). The Nakarood watershed is between 36° 25′ 38″ and 36° 42′ 58″ N and 53° 17′ 51″ and 54° 44′ 28″ E in Mazandaran, Golestan and Semnan provinces, Iran. A general view of the study watershed and its extension in three provinces has been shown in Fig. 1  . The mainstream length is 176 km with a permanent river. According to the average monthly flow chart, the regime of this river is snowy-rainy upstream and rainy-snowy in the middle and downstream (Roustahi et al., 2016 ). The mean slope of the watershed is 25 %, and the mean elevation is 1607 m, ranging from 50 to 3818 m above mean sea level (Hosseinzadeh et al., 2023 ). Regarding geology, limestone, marl, and silty marl constitute a large part of the Nekaood Watershed. The mean annual precipitation and temperature of the Nekaood Watershed are 647 mm and 15.5 °C, respectively. Based on the analysis of the Ambrothermic curve, the dry and wet periods of the watershed are 180 and 179 days, indicating a semi-humid temperate and semi-humid cold climate. The watershed's dominant land uses are rangeland, forest, and agriculture (Khosh-Ravesh et al., 2014 ). The number of villages reaches 108, with a population of 37,243 in 2022. The most economic income of households living in the region is from agricultural activities and livestock (General Department of Natural Resources and Watershed Management of Mazandaran Province, 2015 ).  2.2 Research methodology The present research is an initial endeavor to assess the coincidence between existing developmental conditions in a case study watershed (i.e., Nekarood Watershed) and the UN-SDGs. Hence, we had to use the same criteria and factors proposed by the UN, and they were applicable to the study watershed. Regarding the relevance of the study criteria and watershed management, despite various levels of dependency and interaction between the study criteria and watershed management, the UN-SDGs directly or indirectly influence the main goals of the watershed management projects focusing on restoring or conserving ecological balance and improving social and economic conditions of the watershed stakeholders as pointed out by former scholars (Alai et al., 2017 ; Mirchooli and Sadeghi, 2019 ; Alizadeh Dolatabadi et al., 2023 ; Nikjoui, 2023 ). This study is characterized by its “descriptive-analytical” nature and employs a combined methodology incorporating both quantitative and qualitative methods (Issa and Saleh, 2023 ). Data for this research was collected through a comprehensive review of books, research papers, conference proceedings, the 2022 Statistical yearbooks of the health and statistics centers, national and international databases, and consulting with relevant authorities, rural municipalities, and councils. Base maps were prepared using Landsat 8 satellite data for 2021 and Landsat 5 for 2000. These data were collected from ETM and TM sensors, and the preparation process involved using a support vector machine and ArcMap software. To conduct the study, 179 quantitative data and 15 qualitative data were used to determine the performance of 15 SDGs at the study watershed including 37, 39, 16, 12, 4, 22, 3, 11, 7, 7, 3, 3, 11, 17, and 2 data, respectively, for objectives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17. Additional information related to qualitative variables was also acquired through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires (Farzi et al., 2022 ). Questionnaires of governance and social criteria of sustainable development were compiled according to the goals and hypotheses of the research, with 70 and 33 initial criteria, respectively. In the pre-test phase, content validity for each questionnaire item was assessed using quantitative and qualitative criteria. Some 18 questionnaires were distributed among experts and professors of different fields to incorporate necessary adjustments and standardization. After receiving ten respondents, the questionnaire was finalized using 40 governances and 26 social criteria. According to Lawshe's table for evaluation of the relative validity coefficient (CVR) (Hatamnejad et al., 2023 ), the lowest CVR of 0.62 was considered for ten experts. In this research, the relative coefficient of validity of the items of governance and the social criteria of sustainable watershed development, whose values were <0.62, were removed from the questionnaire, and the items with a relative coefficient of validity higher than 0.8 remained. About 15 questions representing the status and level of public transportation services, transportation roads, educational and scientific services, health services, welfare and medical centers, recreation and cultural services, public services and goods, housing provision, the market for the supply and sale of products, centers for providing agricultural inputs, centers for providing livestock inputs, extension services, poverty and hunger, the participation of watershed residents by the government in the decision-making of development programs, effectiveness, the government and the governing body in establishing security and the number of disputes and conflicts in the watershed were used to calculate the indicators and objectives of the research. The reliability criterion was also used to measure internal consistency. To answer the statistical population and quantify the questions, the five-choice Likert rating scale was used to assign points of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to very low, low, medium, high, and very high classes, respectively (Apdita et al., 2023 ; Tayebnia et al., 2023 ). The statistical population includes individuals aged over 40 years residing in the Nekarood Watershed. Since the performance of many of the current sustainable development goals of the watershed indicates the state of governance for 30 years, to achieve the desired result, the 40-year-old residents of the watershed were interviewed to report the last 30 years considerably. Based on Cochran's formula and associated table (Tayebnia et al., 2023 ), 373 watershed residents were selected as respondents. The performance threshold of each indicator was determined through the five steps proposed by Sachs et al. (2022) .1) Using absolute numerical thresholds in the SDGs, such as objectives like complete gender equality, access to clean water, and no poverty.  2) Applying the “leave no one behind” or zero deprivation principle by setting the upper bound to universal access where no explicit SDG is available.  3) Using science-based objectives that must be met to establish the upper bound by 2030 or later (for instance, 100 % sustainable fisheries management, zero greenhouse gas emissions from CO2  required by 2050 for global warming to stay within 1.5 °C).  4) Applying the mean of the top five performers where numerous nations have previously surpassed an SDG (for instance, child mortality).  5) Using the mean of the other indicators' best performers.    In the score distribution of the indicators, the lower bound (threshold) was defined at 2.5th, the upper bound scored 100, and values below the lower bound scored zero. After establishing the upper and lower bounds, variables were linearly transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 using Eqs. (1) , (2)  for positive- and negative-effect variables, respectively (Sadeghi et al., 2023 ; Tang et al., 2023 ).(1) X s  = X i  − X min   X max  − X min       (2) X s  = X max  − X i   X max  − X min       where xs  is the normalized value after rescaling, xi  is the raw data value, and Xmax  and Xmin  denote the upper and lower bounds, respectively. The SDI of the watershed was also developed and finalized by adapting to the indicators of global SDGs, as summarized in Table 1  , and refers to the SDI of the plural basin. The normalized numerical value also represents the distance from the worst and best state of the desired variable. The arithmetic and geometric means of the targets' score and SDG indicator were used to weigh and aggregate the target and goals of SD. Additionally, the geometric mean of 15 goals was used to calculate the performance of the ultimate goal of watershed development. Goals 13 and 14 were removed from the evaluation. Goal 13, dealing with climate action, focuses on the large scale, and goal 14 is also related to underwater life, which needs to be clarified in the study watershed. Using the most recent watershed data for 2022 and calculating the distance from the objective, the present level of the SDG indicators was established. The green and red sectors are only shown if two factors are taken into account to determine the performance of a target and are in, respectively, their best (green) and worst (red) states. Four different color categories were used to identify the warning signs: green (target achieved), yellow (challenges still exist), orange (significant challenges), and red (serious challenges) (Sachs et al., 2022 ).   3 Results and discussions The present study aimed to assess the SD of the Nakarood watershed using the indicators and goals of global SD. Accordingly, the appropriate conceptualization was made, and a complete list of goals and indicators effective in the watershed's SD was accordingly prepared (Table 1 ). The results showed that, among 240 indicators of the United Nations SDGs, 77 indicators with complete information and according to the ecological conditions of the region could be used to determine the developmental status of the watershed. The SDGs' indicators were employed at the study watershed scale since it is a standard, comprehensive, and globally accepted tool obtained from several international organizations. The approach effectively evaluates the degree of agreement between development projects and UN-SDGs. The approach fundamentally differs from merely arbitrary traditional economic, social, and environmental indicators. The ultimate goal of watershed management in many countries, especially developing countries, is to achieve an ecological balance and improve economic status and social health, an essential principle in integrated watershed management (Mirchooli and Sadeghi, 2019 ; Alizadeh Dolatabadi et al., 2023 ). Goals 13 and 14 and associated indicators were also removed from the calculation process because they did not apply to the study watershed's scale. The values, thresholds, justification of optimal values, rankings, and performance for each SDI of the Nekarood Watershed were determined based on Table 2  . The indicator performance of the Nekarood Watershed and associated indicators are also portrayed in Fig. 2  . 3.1 Goal 1 (ending poverty) Table 2  and Fig. 2 a show that the performance of the first goal of sustainable watershed development was 57.97 %. Accordingly, the SDG1–5-1 indicator achieved a performance of 100 %, a score of 0 %, and a green rank showing the highest performance of the indicators. The aforesaid exceptional performance can be attributed to different factors, including construction of Gelevard Reservoir Dam and 64.96 % change in the extent of ecosystems related to water, adherence to technical construction principles, the high statistics of suitable housing for families (63.7 %), the implementation of watershed plans and projects, the high number of abandoned agricultural lands with a high slope, converting agricultural lands to gardens, increasing people's awareness of the risks of natural disasters, and most importantly, the absence of severe and destructive natural disasters in recent years. Increasing social development (e.g., education and social equality), economic development, and risk management improvement were also essential factors in enhancing the performance of SDG 1-5-1, as similarly reported by Yang et al. (2023) . The SDG1-3-1 indicator also showed the most negative effect on the watershed's SD, with a red rank, a score of 15.53 % compared to the region's population, and a performance of 13.36 % compared to the global SDGs. The underwhelming performance of this indicator revealed that, aside from the provision of public subsidies, the government has only adequately supported a small portion of the region's poor people through supporting groups like aid committees and welfare organizations. Lack of government support for financial assistance to underprivileged students, absence of skill-training centers, non-payment of educational subsidies to students, insufficient financial aid for agricultural land improvement, inadequate infrastructure for protecting agricultural land, and the absence of incentive mechanisms for financial support to farmers have led to a decrease in the performance of SDG 1-3-1 indicator in the study area. The study findings do not align with the report of the International Development Center (2021) in China.  3.2 Goal 2 (ending hunger) The results (Table 2  and Fig. 2 a) showed that the second goal of the watershed SD achieved a performance of 15.24 % of the global SDG. This performance was also influenced by the mean score of six indicators, including volume of production per labor unit (SDG2-3-1), cereal yield (SDG2-3-3), proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture (SDG2-4-1), consumption of hazardous pesticides (SDG2-4-2), agricultural orientation (SDG2-a-1) and agricultural sector investment (SDG-2-a-2). The indicator with the most positive effect was SDG-2-a-2, with a performance of 42.78 %, a score of 35.72 %, and a yellow rank of the indicators. Conversely, the most damaging effect was related to the two crucial indicators of SDG2-4-2 and SDG2-4-1 with respective performances of −841.2 and 0 %, scores of 2353 tons per one million populations, and 0 % of sustainability with a red rank of the indicators. From the total USD 39461532 of investment in the agricultural sector, it has been distributed as 48.24 in livestock, 35.17 in chicken, 8.72 in machinery, 3.55 in water storage, 1.58 in fish farming, 1.40 in beekeeping, 0.61 in greenhouse, 0.56 in medicinal plants, and 0.14 % in milk collection. Developed countries such as the United States at 19.1 %, Switzerland at 8.6 %, Germany at 8.5 %, the United Kingdom at 6.4 %, Japan at 5.2 %, China at 4.8 %, and France at 4.3 % allocate over half of global agricultural sector investments leading to a high level of food security. This reflects widespread investment at the global scale. In contrast, as pointed out by Zhao and Chen (2023) , countries suffer from food insecurity, receiving only 20 % of global agricultural investments worldwide, highlighting the unequal distribution of global agricultural investment. The 8.41 times higher global consumption of pesticides in the agricultural sector and the lack of productive and sustainable agriculture showed a 100 % distance from the global SDG controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad. FAO (2022a, 2022b, 2022c, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c)  reported that global pesticide consumption increased by approximately 50 % during 1990–2020, with an average of 370 tons per one million persons. In 2020, the Americas and Africa had the highest and lowest pesticide consumption. Pesticide consumption increased by an average of 30 % from 2019 to 2020, consistent with the present research findings. According to the Economic Group (2022) , Sweden, Japan, Canada, Finland, and Austria have the most sustainable agricultural and food systems. Additionally, 28 of 78 countries prioritize agriculture based on international climate and water commitments. The poor performance of the SDGs of the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad is due to the incomplete implementation of the executive regulations for “setting up of Agricultural, Rural and Nomadic Service Centers.” These regulations were approved in 2013 by the Islamic Council Research Center. According to Article 68 of the regulations, the minimum number of specialized and experienced human resources in the required disciplines is 19 for the initial establishment of Agricultural, Rural, and Nomadic Service Centers. In addition, according to Article 78 of this regulation, employees must have continuous contact with the villagers in their permanent residence in the village. However, the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad's practices, including employing two to three non-specialists, lack of continuous supervision and monitoring in carrying out planting operations, cultivating and harvesting agricultural products, lack of specialized water, soil, and plant laboratories in the watershed, consumption of more than eight times dangerous poisons and pesticides and the doubling of nitrogenous chemical fertilizers compared to the highest global amount, neglecting the importance of protected areas to increase biodiversity, and weakness in responsibility and responsiveness of managers and experts. In general, weak governance and the need for a comprehensive and transparent ministry plan have all contributed to the reduced performance of the region's SDGs.  3.3 Goal 3 (providing a healthy life) Table 2  and Fig. 2 a further depicted a performance of 69.82 % in the third goal of sustainable watershed development compared to other SDGs. This goal showed the highest global performance among sustainable watershed development which was assessed using ten indicators of maternal mortality rate (SDG3-1-1), neonatal mortality rate (SDG3-2-1), births attended by skilled health personnel (SDG3-1-2), mortality rate, under-5 (SDG3-2-2), crude mortality (SDG3-4-1), gap in life expectancy at birth among regions (SDG3 4-4-), life expectancy at birth (SDG 5-4-3), adolescent fertility rate (SDG 3-7-2), population covered by insurance (SDG 3-8-2), and density and density and distribution coefficient of health workers (SDG3-C-1). In this regard, SDG3-1-1, SDG3-1-2, SDG3-2-1, and SDG3-2-2 indicators had the most positive effects, with 100 % performance and green rank of the indicators. On the contrary, SDG3-4-4 and SDG3-C-1 also showed the most negative effect on the performance of SDG3, with a performance of −48.45 and 19.06 %, respectively, with red and orange ranks. Good governance of rural health and treatment base, comprehensive health centers, health houses, continuous monitoring and evaluation of the health and treatment network of the cities, accurate implementation of vital zij model (MHME, 2014 ). The findings of this study's investigation into the third goal align with the UNICEF report's findings. Therefore, UNICEF (2023)  stated that during the past three decades, there has been a dramatic improvement in child survival, sparing millions of children from impending death. Only one in 26 kids will pass away before turning five, according to figures from 2021. In the 1990s, the death rate for children under five was 1.8 %; from 2010 to 2021, it was 2.7 %. Sub-Saharan Africa had the most significant child death rate in 2021, accounting for 83 % of all under-five mortality globally. Globally, preterm birth and birth complications are listed as the leading causes of under-five mortality, along with infectious illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria. Good governance of rural health and treatment base, comprehensive health centers, health houses, continuous monitoring and evaluation of the health and treatment network of the cities, accurate implementation of vital zij model (MHME, 2014 ) by recording fertility and mortality events, covered people were the influential factors in getting performance above. Calculation of demographic-health indicators by experienced team health and treatment, especially for rural health assistance, has led to an increase in the performance of well-performed indicators (i.e., SDG3-1-1, SDG3-1-2, SDG3-2-1, SDG3-2-2, SDG3-8-2, SDG3-7-2, SDG3-4-4) and finally, improving the performance of the third primary goal of sustainable watershed development (Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MHME), 2014 ). Life expectancy also results from the health system's particular attention to science and technology. However, various economic, social, and environmental factors have led to a decrease in life expectancy and an increase in the gap at birth among different regions (Taheri et al., 2015 ). Moreover, the indicator of density and distribution of health workers, with its lowest performance and due to lack of specialized human resources of physicians, midwives, dentists, nurses, and health assistants in comprehensive health centers and health houses caused a decrease in the performance of the third goal of SD of the watershed. According to the World Health Organization (2021) , the density of nursing and midwifery personnel in the United States and European regions is over 82 and 77 individuals per 10,000 populations, respectively. The physician density in the European region is approximately 43 individuals per 10,000 population. However, the overall health worker ratio is 30.61 individuals per 10,000 populations in the watershed, indicating an unfavorable condition in the region. The research results showed a large gap between the performance of the watershed in the density index of health workers compared to the highest global performance.  3.4 Goal 4 (providing inclusive education) Table 2  and Fig. 2 a reported that the fourth goal of the sustainable development of the Nakarood Watershed achieved a performance of 25.60 %. Eight indicators, namely net primary enrollment rate (SDG4-1-1), lower secondary completion rate (SDG4-1-2), the participation rate in preprimary organized (SDG4-2-1), tertiary educational attainment aged 25–34 (SDG4-3-1), literacy gap of men and women over 15 (SDG4-5-1), literacy rate aged 15–24 (SDG4-6-1), the proportion of schools with complete educational facilities (SDG4-a-1) and teachers with the minimum necessary qualifications, by education level (SDG4-C-1) were used for the assessment. SDG4-1-1, SDG4-2-1, and SDG4-1-2 indicators, with the performance of −5.91, −29.69, and −18.49 %, scoring 51.07, 15.70, 8.65 %, and red rank were the most damaging. Conversely, the most positive impact was related to the SDG4-C-1, with a performance and score of 100 % and a green rank. Five nations, including Norway, Ireland, Montenegro, France, and Australia, have a total performance score of 100 % for SDG4-1-1, according to the World Bank Education Statistics (2023) . At the same time, Somalia had the lowest rating, with 14.5 %. Furthermore, Nigeria received the lowest score (16.17 %), and Thailand received the highest (126 %), indicating subpar performance. The absence of enrollment criteria under the law is one of the critical causes of the organized preprimary learning participation index's subpar performance. The watershed region has also performed poorly regarding net primary enrolment, low secondary completion, and the literacy gender gap due to rural dispersion, financial poverty, child labor, cultural poverty, and misunderstandings in specific households. According to UNESCO (2023) , most instructors worldwide are trained and competent in both areas. The proportion of trained teachers in sub-Saharan Africa fell from 84 % in 2000 to 69 % in 2019.  3.5 Goal 5 (gender equality) According to Table 2  and Fig. 2 a, the fifth goal of watershed development had a weak performance of 25.76 %. Among different indicators, the ratio of female to male labor force participation (SDG5-C-2) showed the most negative impact, recording a performance of −3.06 %, a score of 19.10 %, and a red rank. In contrast, the gender wage gap (SDG5-b-2) exhibits the most positive effect, with a performance of 54.58 % and 16.67 % and an orange rank. Therefore, 17.22 % of females and 90.18 % of males over 15 were in the economically active population group. In addition, 82.78 % of females over 15 in the study watershed also belonged to the economically inactive population (i.e., scholars, housewives, income without work). The economically active population included employed or unemployed people who participate in the country's product production and services or who can participate seven days before the enumerator's visit (Statistical Center of Iran, 2020 ). Also, the wages of males and females over 15 years, with USD 0.90 and USD 0.75 per hour, respectively, showed a difference of 16.67 % in the SDG5-b-2 indicator for the same work (Sachs et al., 2022 ). Overall, the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia had the lowest average female labor force participation rates compared to males from 2006 to 2023, at 30 % and 34 %, respectively, according to the World Economic Forum (2023) . North America received the highest score (84 %), followed by Europe (82 %), East Asia and the Pacific (80 %), and South America (80 %). In 146 nations worldwide, the gender pay gap has been reported to be 68.4 %, an improvement over 2023 of 0.3 %. The study's findings showed a 13.82 % difference from the global average.  3.6 Goal 6 (sustainable management of water and public health) According to the study results (Table 2  and Fig. 2 a), the sixth goal of sustainable watershed development performed at the tune of 45.78 % and an orange rank. Moreover, the results showed that the sixth development goal was influenced by 11 critical indicators, including the population using at least essential drinking water services (SDG6-1-1), population using at least essential sanitation services (SDG6-2-1), anthropogenic wastewater treatment (SDG6-3-1), areas with quality and sanitary water (SDG6-3-2), environmental performance index (SDG6-3-3), water stress level (freshwater withdrawal) (SDG6-4-1) per capita stored water (SDG6-4-2), changes in the extent of water-related ecosystems over time (SDG6-6-1), population using safely managed sanitation services (SDG6-a-2), population using safely managed water services (SDG6-a 3-) and government support in strengthening the participation of local communities in improving water management (SDG6-b-1). Among different indicators, the environmental performance index (SDG6-3-3) showed the most negative impact, recording a performance of −10.51 %, 12.70 %, and a yellow rank. The population using at least essential drinking water services (SDG6-1-1) exhibited the most positive effect, with a performance of 90.98 %, a score of 99.34 %, and a green rank. In addition, 71.63 and 79.81 % of the population benefited from essential health services independent of other families and safe and clean water. Moreover, 64.96 % of changes have been made in the extent of water ecosystems in the region with the Gelevard reservoir dam's construction, as Nasiri et al. (2020)  pointed out. Hence, it positively affected the sixth goal of sustainable watershed development. In addition, the lack of an anthropogenic wastewater treatment system, 0.61 % of water storage per capita, and the population lacking the services of transportation and sanitary treatment of human wastes independent from other families have led to a decrease in the performance of the sixth goal of watershed development. Similar findings were reported by Sachs et al. (2022) . According to Sachs et al. (2022) , the highest and lowest performance on SDG6-1-1 belongs to Latin America and Oceania, with 95.5 % and 54.1 %, respectively. According to the Global EPI Center (2022) , Denmark and India have the highest and lowest EPI scores among 180 countries worldwide, with 77.90 % and 18.90 %, respectively. Based on this, the Nakroud Watershed, with 6.2 %, had a lower performance than the global minimum.  3.7 Goal 7 (access to sustainable energy) The performance of the seventh goal in the study watershed was 51.08 % with the orange rank based on findings (Table 2  and Fig. 2 a). Three indicators of households with access to electricity (SDG7-1-1), population with access to clean fuels and technology for cooking (SDG7-1-2), and the share of renewable energy in total primary energy supply (SDG7-2-1) were used for performance evaluation. The SDG7-1-1 indicator, with a performance of 95.03 %, score of 95.48 %, and yellow rank, demonstrated the most positive effect, and the SDG7-2-1 indicator, with zero performance and score and red rank, showed the most negative effect on the watershed's performance from the viewpoint of SD's seventh goal. Notably, 100 % of residential houses have a national electricity network. The difference of 4.52 % of the electricity network score with the total number of watershed households is caused by the ordinary living of some households in a single dwelling without independent housing, and it is also due to illegal buildings. Moreover, the study area lacks hydro-renewable energy, geothermal, solar, windy, solid biofuels, biogas, biodiesel, liquid biofuels, biogas, and the renewable sector of urban waste. This is because watershed residents use natural gas and kerosene for cooking. In 2022, the number of people worldwide without access to electricity reached 760 million, an increase compared to 2019. This crisis is mainly attributed to the global spread of COVID-19 and regional tyrannies. This increase is most found in sub-Saharan Africa, reaching up to 80 %. It is predicted that this number may continue to rise in 2023. Approximately 2.3 billion people also lack access to clean cooking facilities, with 40 % in sub-Saharan Africa and 55 % in Asian countries. This issue is exacerbated due to an energy crisis, which is different from the results of the present study. The global average use of renewable energy sources also exceeded 12.5 % in 2020 and has continued to increase in 2022. Iceland had the highest performance in this index in 2022, at 82.78 %, while the lowest performance, at 0.05 %, was related to Saudi Arabia and Oman. Iran had a performance of 0.87 %. Supportive policies in many countries worldwide significantly increase this index (International Energy Agency, 2023 ). The current research on the renewable energy share index needs to be more consistent and different from the results of the International Energy Agency.  3.8 Goal 8 (sustainable economic growth and productive employment) The eighth sustainable watershed development goal resulted from Table 2  and Fig. 2 a performed at 39.26 % with orange rank. It was, therefore, 60.74 % away from the final SDGs. This goal was calculated using geometric mean of nine indicators viz., nominal GDP per capita based on PPP purchasing power parity (SDG8-5-1), unemployed female (SDG8-5-2), unemployed male (SDG8-5-3), unemployed population (SDG8-5-4), employment rate (SDG8-5-5), labor force participation rate (economic participation) (SDG8-5-7), youth not in employment, education or training (SDG8-6-1), direct tourism GDP (SDG 1-8-9), tourism industry employment (SDG8-9-2), and the number of commercial bank branches (SDG8-10-1). SDG8-5-2, SDG8-5-3, SDG8-5-4, and SDG8-6-1 indicators positively affected SDG8 with respective performance of 85.05, 88.98, 87.20 and 77.26 %. The most damaging effect indicators were SDG8-5-1, SDG8-9-1, SDG8-9-2, and SDG8-10-1, with performances of 1.19, 1.07, −23.78, and 2.48 %, respectively. Therefore, the indicator related to the number of commercial banks in the watershed, with 14.75 banks per 100,000 adult population, has 45.95 fewer banks than the global mean of 60.70. According to the statistics of 2021, Saudi Arabia and Palestine have the most and lowest number of global bank branches, with 1501.22 and 0.52, respectively (IMF, 2023a, 2023b ). The SDG-8-9-1 indicator was also assigned an insignificant performance of 0.45 % of the total gross domestic product of the watershed and 1.07 % compared to the global indicator. The 0.44 % investment in this sector, the lack of necessary tourism infrastructure, and the weak organizational structure of the governmental and private sectors have caused the poor performance of this critical Industry. In the same direction, the region's SDG-8-9-2 indicator also showed 0.17 and 92.96 % distance from the region's highest global percentage (i.e., 15.20 %) in 2019 in the Caribbean region (Simpson, 2022 ). Besides, the SDG8-5-1 indicator, with a performance of 1.19 %, USD 2235, and orange rank, was 98.81 % lower than USD 145,196 reported for Ireland in 2023. On the other hand, the excellent performance of SDG8-5-2, SDG8-5-3, SDG8-5-4, and SDG8-6-1, with the respective performance of 6.52, 3.22, 3.75, and 12.67 %, and Yellow, green, green and orange ranks improved the eighth global SDG (Statistical Center of Iran, 2020 ). The projected 2023 average unemployment rate, according to data across 101 countries, stands at 7.12 %. South Africa reported the highest rate at 34.72 %, while Thailand exhibited the lowest at 1 %. Within the Asian region, the 2023 average across 25 countries comes in at 5.71 %, with Georgia recording the highest at 19.51 % and Thailand retaining the lowest at 1 % (Global Economy, 2023 ). Meanwhile, unemployment rates remain historically low in the European Union and the Euro area, with figures of 5.9 % and 6.4 %, respectively. The highest female unemployment rate is attributed to the West Bank and Gaza, with a rate of 42 %, while the lowest is in Qatar at 0.3 %. The highest and lowest male unemployment rates worldwide are also in South Africa and Qatar, with 28.4 % and 0.1 %, respectively (World Bank, 2023 ). The current renewable energy share index results differ from the International Energy Agency results.  3.9 Goal 9 (creating resistant infrastructure and promoting sustainable industry) In Table 2  and Fig. 2 b, the performance of SDG9 of the Nekarood Watershed stands at 19.71 %, among other SDGs. This goal was controlled by the logistics performance index (SDG9-1-1), industry sector value added (SDG9-2-1), industry sector employment (SDG9-2-2), and the population using the Internet (SDG9-c-1). As seen in Table 2 , the most positive effect on the performance of development goal 9 for the study watershed belonged to the SDG9-2-1 indicator with a performance of 46.41 % compared to the global ideal point, with a score of 23.71 % and a green rank of SDI. These results are attributed to the difference in income of USD 986,614 and the cost of USD 797,529 in tourism industries, mineral water, sand, and stone powder production. On the contrary, the most negative effect was assigned to the indicators SDG9-1-c and SDG9-2-2, with performance of 36.53 % and 3.10 %, score of 38.12 % and 4.10 %, respectively, and red rank of the indicators. Direct employment in the industry sector, with 316 people, included 4.10 % of the employment of the watershed. In 2022, the global Industry's average added value, as reported across 146 countries, stood at 139.08 billion USD. China recorded the highest value at 7171.64 billion USD, while Micronesia reported the lowest value at just 0.02 billion USD (World Bank, 2023 ). Meanwhile, the average number of broadband internet subscribers in 2021, based on data from 192 countries, was 6,887,000 subscribers. China had the highest number, with 535,787,000 subscribers, whereas the Central African Republic had the lowest, with no reported subscribers (World Bank, 2023 ). The highest industrial employment rate is associated with Qatar, at 54 %, while the lowest is attributed to Djibouti. Iran also achieved a 35.34 % performance (Trading Economics, 2023 ). The results of the current study are in a good position in terms of added value. However, in two indicators of employment creation in the industry sector and population using the Internet, it could be in a better position compared to the report of the World Bank and Trading Economics (2023) .  3.10 Goal 10 (reducing inequality) The tenth watershed SDG has a performance of 24.98 %, according to Table 2  and Fig. 2 b. This objective has been given the red rank of the global SDGs and was influenced by three indicators: the percentage of persons living below 50 % of the region's median income (SDG10-2-1), the Gini coefficient (SDG10-1-3), and the labor share of GDP (SDG10-4-1). The findings indicated that SDG10-3-1 and SDG10-4-1 indicators had the most favorable and unfavorable effects on SDG10. These indicators perform 52.11 % and −37.98 % globally, respectively, with scores of 44.50 and 0.65 % for the region and red rank. The SDG10-2-1 watershed indicator also showed a performance of 22.84 % compared with the global ideal point, a regional score of 8.08 %, and the orange rank of the indicators (Statistical Center of Iran, 2021 ). Colombia recorded the highest figure at 53.5 index points, while Slovenia reported the lowest at 24 index points (World Bank, 2023 ). Iran's Gini coefficient for 2022 stood at 18.39, as the Statistical Center of Iran reported in 2021, which is consistent with the study results. Switzerland and Venezuela had the highest and lowest labor shares in their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2020, with performances of 68.4 % and 10.2 %, respectively (ILO, 2021, 2022, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c, 2023d, 2023e, 2023f ).  3.11 Goal 11 (creating sustainable cities and human settlements) The eleventh SDG got a performance of 42.08 %, as shown in Table 2  and Fig. 2 b, ranking it in the orange category of global SDGs and indicators. The population without access to adequate public transit (SDG11-2-1) and the population without access to sufficient housing (SDG11-1-1) were used as the indicators to calculate SDG11. Compared to the SDGs and their 28.37 % and 36.93 % region scores, the red rank indicators for SDGs 11–1-1 and 11–2-1 performed 68.47 % and 25.86 %, respectively. About 42.16 % of the 637.364 km road network connecting the watershed settlements has been paved. Additionally, public transportation was available in 18.52 % of the villages in the area. Residents of the watershed reported a 57.4 % satisfaction rate in this area due to these improvements. It was significant to remember that the poor and low-income residents of the watershed also own low-quality, insecure, and outdated buildings. In Hong Kong, 80 % of the population prefers public transport, demonstrating the highest usage rate. Meanwhile, approximately 63 % of Kenya's population relies on public transport (WorldAtlas, 2023 ). The global average performance of the Access to Transport Index for the year 2019 stands at 50 % (UNSTATES, 2020 ). In addition, 1.6 billion people, which accounts for 20 % of the world's population, lack proper housing (UN, 2019 ), which is consistent with the results of this research.  3.12 Goal 12 (sustainable production and consumption) According to Table 2  and Fig. 2 b, the twelfth SDG performed at a rate of 57.24 %. Three indicators, namely villages with garbage collection systems (SDG12-5-1), electronic waste (SDG12-4-2), and production-based nitrogen emissions (SDG12-4-1). SDG12-4-2 indicator performance was 100 %, which aligns with the global SDG's ideal point. Green rating and zero kilograms per individual are the results of this achievement. Performance according to the SDG12-4-1 metric was 38.16 %. This performance was classified as the red level, and the population's mean weight of 27.83 kg per person has the most significant detrimental impact on SD's twelfth goal. With a performance of 49.8 % compared to the global ideal point, the SDG12-5-1 indicator also ranked in the orange category of the indicators ranking. The area's rural municipalities gather garbage, transport it to a specified location, and burn it there. Farmers spread animal manure on fields as a natural fertilizer. In 2021, China emerged as the leading consumer of nitrogen fertilizer, utilizing a substantial 22.55 million metric tons. Following that, India and the United States ranked second and third, using 19.44 and 11.17 million metric tons, respectively. Turkey had the lowest consumption, accounting for 1.79 million tons (Statista, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c ), which is consistent with the results of this study. On the subject of e-waste, the world generates >50 million metric tons annually, which equates to an average of seven kilograms of e-waste per person. Asia is responsible for nearly half of the global e-waste production, with China being the most significant contributor. Despite its high total e-waste output, Asia produces almost three times less e-waste per person than Europe (Statista, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c ), which is inconsistent with the results of the electronic waste indicator.  3.13 Goal 15 (protection, restoration, and promotion of sustainable exploitation of terrestrial ecosystems) According to the results (Table 2  and Fig. 2 b), the fifteenth watershed SDG performed 29.91 % as expected. The combined effects of four significant indicators that led to this outcome were forest area (SDG1-1-1), mean area protected in terrestrial places important to biodiversity (SDG1-1-2), annual change in forest area (SDG15-2-1), and mountain green cover index (SDG15-4-2). These indicators were carried out at different levels, with corresponding scores and classifications. For example, the forest area was labeled as yellow with a score of 37.10 %. The annual fluctuations in forest area scored 80 % and were classified as orange at a 42 % rank, while the mean area protected area obtained a score of 6.42 % and was designated red. As a result, the SDG15-2-1 indicator, which had the highest performance, was crucial to the overall performance of SDG15, while SDG1-1-2 had the lowest performance. The findings indicated that forests and protected areas accounted for 36.03 % and 8.76 % of the watershed area, respectively. In addition, forests, rangelands, and agricultural land-uses comprised 51.61 % of the mountainous watershed areas. However, due to poor governance, a lack of focus on the SD of the watershed, and an insignificant amount of protected areas, the annual rate of permanent forest degradation has increased to 0.3 %, which has caused a decrease in the mountain's green cover. From 2010 to 2020, Africa experienced the highest annual rate of net forest loss, at 3.9 million ha, followed by South America with a loss of 2.6 million ha. In contrast, Asia experienced an annual addition of 1.2 million ha of forest during the same period (FAO, 2020 ). The results of the current research on the indicator of forest level changes are inconsistent with the results of FAO in the Asian continent. They are in line with the results of America and Africa.  3.14 Goal 16 (access to justice for all and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels) According to Table 2  and Fig. 2 b findings, sustainable watershed development Goal 16 had a performance rating of 55.07 %. The population's perception of safety when out alone at night in the city or neighborhood (SDG16-1-4), the number of intentional homicides (SDG16-1-1), the level of public satisfaction with government services (government efficiency) (SDG16-6-2), the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of justice (SDG16-7-2) and the number of birth registrations with civil authorities for children under the age of five (SDG16-9-1) are five crucial effective indicators. With 100.80 and 100 % performance, a score of zero and 100 %, and the same green rank, SDG16-1-1 and SDG16-9-1 indicators had the most beneficial influence on the region's 16th SD goal. The absence of deliberate homicide demonstrates the area's high level of security and the people's cooperation with the governmental, judicial, and security apparatus. The SDG16-7-2 indicator, on the other hand, had the worst impact on the 16th SDG, with a performance rating of −8.01, a score of 29.22 %, and a red rank. The findings indicated that the government encouraged 29.22 % of the watershed's population to participate in formulating development program decisions and policies. In contrast, 70.78 % of decisions were made without the input of the public or civil society. The lowest intentional homicide rate, with one per 100,000 population, is related to Bahrain and Singapore. In contrast, the highest rate, at 1.52, is attributed to Jamaica (Wikipedia, 2023a, 2023b ), which is inconsistent with the results of the intentional homicide indicator of this research. On average, the global birth registration rate for children under five is 77 %. The highest rates are observed in North America, Central and South Africa, Eastern Europe, and South Asia. In contrast, the lowest rates are found in East Asia (UNICEF, 2019 ), which is different from the results of this research's birth registration rate indicator and even more than the results of North America.  3.15 Goal 17 (revitalize and strengthen the global partnership for SD) According to Table 2  and Fig. 2 b, the only indicator in line with the local ecological circumstances was the foreign direct investment indicator (SDG17-3-1), which impacted the 17th objective of the watershed SD. The SDG17-3-1 indicator performed at a rate of 22.19 %, received a rating of 18.43 %, and was ranked in the yellow category among the indicators. The lack of adequate infrastructure in the industrial sector and the subpar performance of the logistics index in the study region were the most important reasons for the reduction in foreign direct investment. The outcomes of the present study are consistent with Lafortune et al.'s (2018)  thorough methodological research findings and the SDGs reported by Fazelian et al. (2022)  and Sachs et al. (2022) .  3.16 Overall performance of the Nekarood Watershed in achieving SDGs The cumulative achievement of the Nekarood Watershed in meeting the SDGs was summarized in Table 3  . According to the study's findings, five of the 15 SDGs evaluated in the Nekarood Watershed fared more than half as well as their global equivalents. The success rates for goals 3 and 1 were the greatest, with 69.82 % and 57.97 %, respectively—the lowest outcomes pertained to goals 7 and 16, with 51.08 % and 55.07 %, respectively. Globally, the ten watershed SDGs fared below average. Goals 2, 9, 17, and 10 had the lowest ratings, scoring 15.24 %, 19.71 %, 22.19 %, and 24.98 %, respectively. The highest percentages corresponded to goals 6 and 11, with 45.78 % and 42.08 %, respectively. Considering the performance of all 193 UN Member States, Finland is at the top with a remarkable 86.76 % rate, while South Sudan is at the bottom, showing the lowest sustainable development performance at 38.68 %. Iran, in comparison, ranks 86th globally in 2022 with a performance rating of 69.09 %. The significant difference in the average performance and coefficient of variation is very high. Each target was calculated independently by calculating geometric or arithmetic means of several related indicators. Each index was determined separately with the arithmetic or geometric means of many associated variables. Furthermore, there is no specific and direct relationship between calculating different indices for different goals. The high coefficient of variation and significant difference in the average performance in the study indices mainly originated from the inherent characteristics and somehow collinearity of the study indices, limited number of interviewees, diversified stakeholders with various demands, expectations and even interpretations of SDGs (Cling and Delecourt, 2022 ), and heterogeneity in the conditions of the upstream, midstream, and downstream of the study watershed, which wholly necessities further extensive and long-lasted monitoring and evaluation to access more confident output. Determining whether individual indicators had a substantial influence on raising the performance of the watershed was essential for the primary aim of watershed development. The number of fatalities and people reported missing due to catastrophes, the poverty headcount ratio of USD 3.20 per day, and the poverty headcount ratio of USD 1.90 per day represented a few examples of these metrics. On the other hand, the population supported by support systems had the most detrimental effects on the watershed performance. Regarding Watershed SD's third goal, four critical health and treatment indicators—the mortality rate of women, the proportion of births attended by trained medical staff, the mortality rate of infants, and the mortality rate of children under the age of five—have the most significant impacts on the program's performance. Contrarily, the difference in life expectancy at birth was the indicator with the least significant influence on this objective. The percentage of agricultural land used for productive and sustainable agriculture (goal 2), consumption of dangerous pesticides (goal 9), employment in the industry sector and foreign direct investments (goal 17), and the labor share of GDP (goal 10) were among the indicators that have been linked to decreased performance for the goals above. According to this study and from the perspective of institutional evaluation, the Ministries of Agriculture Jihad and Industry, Mine, and Trade had the worst performance. As a result of the effective oversight of rural health and treatment facilities, such as comprehensive health centers and health houses, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, in contrast, has attained a high-performance level. This is further supported by correct vital zij model implementation by a skilled team in the health and treatment sector, notably for rural health assistance and ongoing monitoring and assessment of the health and treatment network in metropolitan areas (MHME, 2014 ). There are nevertheless specific difficulties, notwithstanding this accomplishment. The need for specialist medical staff at comprehensive health facilities and health homes, such as physicians, midwives, dentists, nurses, and health assistants, has reduced health worker indicators' density and distribution coefficient, affecting healthcare delivery. The third aim of sustainable watershed development performed poorly because of the healthcare system's need for a more specific focus on science and technology and a drop in life expectancy. Several factors may be responsible for the Ministry of Agriculture Jihad's poor performance in reaching SDGs. First, lackluster administration and the insufficient execution of the executive rules “Establishment of Agricultural, Rural, and Nomadic Service Centers,” authorized in 1998 by the Islamic Council Parliamentary Research Center, have hindered low development in this field. The inadequate infrastructure of the industrial sector under the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Trade can be connected to the poor performance of foreign direct investment metrics and employment in the watershed. The Ministry of Education's lower secondary graduation rates, the participation rate in preprimary structured learning, and net primary enrolment were three critical metrics that impacted the mean performance of the watershed's fourth SDG. Enhancing performance in these areas could help achieve the goal.   4 Conclusion The alignment of regional SDI in the Nekarood Watershed with the global SDGs at large was examined in the current study. Accordingly, each SDI's essential values, thresholds, rationale of optimals, ranking, and performance were established. The results demonstrated that numerous issues and discrepancies, including the demand for legal requirements for preschool registration, can be blamed for the poor performance of the indicator of the participation rate in preprimary structured learning. In order to further reduce involvement, families should be made more aware of the significance of preparing kids physically, cognitively, and skillfully before they start primary school. There are many reasons why the watershed's statistics for the net primary enrolment rate and the literacy gap between men and women over 15 are performing below expectations. Village dispersal, challenges in enrolling the necessary number of pupils for operations, school closures, financial hardship, child labor, unavailability of boarding schools for primary education, cultural considerations, and misunderstandings by some families were a few of these. According to the research findings, the total performance for the SD of the watershed is 36.42 %. According to the study's evaluation of the worldwide SDI and goals, the watershed's achievement was in the orange group, which signified considerable problems. It is still 63.58 % away from achieving the world's optimum point. Several crucial efforts are required to solve these difficulties and advance SD. These steps to avert losses and harm to the economy, society, and environment involve choosing the right indicators. Sustainable governance to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the government and civil society, improved government and civil society collaboration to make the best use of the existing capacities of the public and private sectors, selection of the most appropriate and effective programs, modification of ineffective methods, raising the level of governance through rethinking the quality of each governance component, resolving regional challenges, and establishment of a sustainable governance system constituted all examples of ways to improve governance in the study watershed. However, more insight assessments at the watershed scale with further input data for missing information, regular monitoring, and ongoing evaluation are recommended to provide decision-makers and stakeholders with an appropriately integrated roadmap leading to the high performance of the pilot watershed to global standards in sustainable development goals. Since there are still lots of uncertainties and ambiguities in such comprehensive and complex studies, more insight future assessments at the watershed scale with further input data for missing information, regular monitoring, and ongoing evaluation are recommended to provide decision-makers and stakeholders with an appropriately integrated roadmap to unhaze ambiguities leading to the high performance of the pilot watershed to global standards in sustainable development goals.
