                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a shared blueprint to support countries in their pursuit of reconciling economic growth with sustainability. This study considers 35 indicators related to the economic SDGs (SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11 and SDG 12) considering available data from 27 European countries in order to identify an aggregate value of sustainability in accordance with the multicriteria analysis. The results obtained make it possible to draw up a ranking in which Sweden comes out on top, ahead of Denmark. Denmark, along with Austria, are the only two countries to perform better than the European average in all 5 SDGs analyzed. In general, northern and western countries outperform other considered countries. The obtained multicriteria aggregate sustainability indicator shows a good linear fit with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. However, Luxembourg and Ireland behave as outliers, showing a high GDP level misaligned from the multicriteria aggregate sustainability indicator. A distinguished characteristic of these countries is the very attractive taxation system, which, as it seems, has succeeded in prompting economic growth yet failing in reconciling it with sustainability objectives. These findings open up to reflections in which growth drivers should be aligned with sustainability targets.

Handling Editor: Cecilia Maria Villas Bôas de Almeida The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a shared blueprint to support countries in their pursuit of reconciling economic growth with sustainability. This study considers 35 indicators related to the economic SDGs (SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11 and SDG 12) considering available data from 27 European countries in order to identify an aggregate value of sustainability in accordance with the multicriteria analysis. The results obtained make it possible to draw up a ranking in which Sweden comes out on top, ahead of Denmark. Denmark, along with Austria, are the only two countries to perform better than the European average in all 5 SDGs analyzed. In general, northern and western countries outperform other considered countries. The obtained multicriteria aggregate sustainability indicator shows a good linear fit with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. However, Luxembourg and Ireland behave as outliers, showing a high GDP level misaligned from the multicriteria aggregate sustainability indicator. A distinguished characteristic of these countries is the very attractive taxation system, which, as it seems, has succeeded in prompting economic growth yet failing in reconciling it with sustainability objectives. These findings open up to reflections in which growth drivers should be aligned with sustainability targets.   Keywords Economic growth  Europe  Gross domestic product  Multicriteria analysis  Sustainable development goals    1 Introduction Sustainable development is one of the most overused words these days. For many, it represents a way to put a brake on environmental degradation that leads to continuous climate change and changes in life style and habits of citizens. Its definition dates back to the Brundtland report in 1987, in which it was defined as 'development that meets the needs of the current generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 ). Our research is based on the assumption that sustainability is the greatest opportunity to improve the relationship between human beings and the environment, overcoming ideological fences and based on analyses that demonstrate the actual sustainability of individual actions. In this scenario, it is necessary for citizens to be an integral part of the change and it is necessary to promote policies in this direction (Colasante and D'Adamo, 2021 ; Lombardi et al., 2021 ; Morone et al., 2021 ). Although the concept was expressed more than thirty years ago, changes were slow to occur due to continuous postponing of relevant decisions. An important achievement, however, was obtained in 2015 with the adoption of 17 SDGs as part of the broader 2030 Agenda, representing a driver for sustainable transition (Allen et al., 2019 ; Liu et al., 2018 ). A survey of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the SDGs showed that developed countries were focused on studying education sustainability; in contrast, developing countries were giving more attention to economic sustainability (Wang and Huang, 2021 ). COVID-19 had different impacts on different economic sectors, and the use of quantitative methods makes it possible to measure the impact also in terms of GDP (Tan et al., 2022 ). The sustainability is a multidisciplinary topic and should cover all countries, without exception. For some authors it is crucial to assess localized sustainability performance and outcomes against the broader SDGs (Winans et al., 2021 ), for others the analysis of regional development is useful to broaden the scope of analysis (Caruso et al., 2020b ). Businesses are being called upon to make major changes towards the SDGs (Calabrese et al., 2021 ), where the role of technology supports the transition (Ikram et al., 2021 ) by encouraging the combination of innovation and sustainability in production (Vacchi et al., 2021b ). These changes also concern the interrelationships between Industry 4.0, smart data and circular economy (Vacchi et al., 2021a ). The direction towards which to tend is therefore that of models based on innovation ecosystems (Nylund et al., 2021 ). The significant number of available indicator associated with SDGs implies that there are potential relationships (Bali Swain and Ranganathan, 2021 ) and in this context an approach that can capture them is pivotal (Dwivedi et al., 2021 ; Khan et al., 2021 ). However, the literature on SDGs is multifaceted: some studies focus on a single country (Ali et al., 2021 ), others provide comparisons among a significant number of countries (Huan et al., 2021 ), whereas others take a global vision (Sebestyén and Abonyi, 2021 ). The European context has indeed attracted particular attention (Caruso et al., 2020a ; Lombardi et al., 2019 ), in particular, recent research has showed a growing attention in assessing the impact of policies implemented to counter the pandemic crises upon SDGs (Cazcarro et al., 2022 ). In addition, the European Commission (2022)  has developed the EU SDG indicator set, which aims to monitor progress toward the goals in an EU context. The Next Generation EU (NGEU), characterized by 360 billion euros in loans and 390 billion euros in grants, is the European policy framework that aims to provide answers to the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 and represents a turning point compared to a policy of austerity, which was adopted following the financial crisis of 2008 (de la Porte and Jensen, 2021 ). Its effective implementation, which will have to be oriented towards avoiding delays in implementation, calls not only for the adoption of simplified implementation procedures but also for a clear territorial orientation but with a limited involvement of regional authorities (Crescenzi et al., 2021 ). Continuous monitoring is a key step in the direction of effectively using NGEU resources, moving in the direction of a sustainable recovery. Although SDGs do not come without some criticisms (the economic and environmental areas seem to be less represented in SDGs (Giannetti et al., 2020 ) and some works proposed a general overview of all these goals (Huan et al., 2021 ; Stanujkic et al., 2020 ), while others focused on specific aspects (De Neve and Sachs, 2020 ; Dorber et al., 2020 )), they provide a great opportunity to measure, monitor and assess progresses towards sustainability. SDGs represent an highly interconnected (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ) framework for reconciling economic growth and the environment. Hence, SDGs calls for integrated governance approaches characterized by the role of public and private sectors in promoting sustainable development. In addition, understanding the real meaning of the concept of sustainable development and incorporating it into national policies turns out to be key to achieving the SDGs (Liu et al., 2021 ). The use of a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is appropriate for evaluating different objectives (Modibbo et al., 2021 ) and this methodology can be used to aggregate several SDGs (including social, environmental and economic pillars) in order to compare different territories (D'Adamo et al., 2021 ). Thus, some authors highlighted how the pandemic period emphasized the need to monitor the SDGs and the urgency of using sound and shared measurement frameworks (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ). A desired feat is to sensitize all countries towards their achievement and to do this there is a tendency to use indicators to monitor and compare the performance of different countries –identifying appropriate statistical methodologies becomes, therefore, a crucial step in this direction (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2021 ). The literature has highlighted how ranking is not only useful to discriminate among a set of alternatives, but can be proficiently used by stakeholders to assess the current situation and identify future perspectives. Bearing this in mind, and focusing on the European Union as a relevant case study (as mentioned it has seen important policies leading to a potential sustainable transition – i.e. the New Green Deal and NGEU (Hametner and Kostetckaia, 2020 )) this work aims at monitoring the progress of Member States (MSs) towards achieving the SDGs. Research related to sustainable development has placed greater emphasis on the economic dimension (Abad-Segura and González-Zamar, 2021 ) and, consequently, the first research objective (RO1) of this study aims to conduct an assessment of economic SDG performance across European countries. In addition, sustainable economic growth is typically compared to other variables such as GDP, green investments and CO2  emissions (Gyamfi et al., 2021 ), and alternative measures of economic well-being to GDP are sought to measure their link to the SDGs (Cook and Davíðsdóttir, 2021 ). Consequently, the results of RO1 can be used to pursue the second research objective (RO2) of this paper, which is to assess the nexus among economic SDGs and economic growth in Europe through quantitative methods.  2 Methods This work is based on MCDA. This method is widely used in the literature because it is able to give synthetic answers by considering multiple items (Özkan et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). Several works have proposed indicators that consider contributions that may also be conflicting (D'Adamo et al., 2020 ; Resce and Schiltz, 2021 ). This work is based on this approach. We started from the classification provided by some authors (Costanza et al., 2016 ; Kettunen et al., 2018 ) that divided the SDGs into the three pillars of sustainability: social, economic and environmental. Our focus was on the economic pillar and therefore SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG11 (Sustainable cities and communities) and SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), were considered. Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union and reference point for the availability of data for the academics, offers a set of indicators for each of these SDGs. We considered all available indicators (not reporting any duplicates) for a total number of 35 (Table A1 ). Once the criteria had been defined, the next step was to construct an overall indicator of the economic SDGs by comparing the performance of all 27 European countries. Temporal analysis based on multiple years is able to capture more detailed information than annual analysis. For this reason, Eurostat indicators were collected over a five-year period (from 2015 to 2019 - the last available year); missing data were replaced by those of the previous year. Where some data were absolute and did not allow for a comparison among different countries, population was used to normalized them. Finally, another normalization process for all indicators was conducted assigning the value of 1 to the best performing country/ies and the value of 0 to the worst performing country/ies (D'Adamo et al., 2020 ). The other countries had an intermediate value between 0 and 1 calculated on the basis of the maximum and minimum values (Tables A2-A16 ). Other approaches proposed reference targets to measure the performance of individual indicators (Ruiz and Cabello, 2021 ). As far as weights are concerned, it was considered that all indicators concurred equally to achieving sustainability and were therefore given equal importance. This choice was made in accordance with the literature (D'Adamo et al., 2021 ). In this work, the scenario with equal weighting among all indicators was compared to the scenario with equal weight assigned to all SDGs, regardless of the number of indicators for each SDG in Italian regions. Some authors emphasized that assigning equal weights to indicators is a key step in sustainable analysis, and the literature review rewards the equal weighting method (Gan et al., 2017 ). In particular, Roszkowska and Filipowicz-Chomko (2020)  pointed out that this method is suitable because the theoretical framework gives each indicator the same adequacy. Thus several authors (Marti and Puertas, 2020 ; Sachs et al., 2018 ) defined this as an appropriate method for assessing sustainability. However, other approaches were also considered appropriate when the weights were made to vary according to the incidence of the individual indicator (Guijarro and Poyatos, 2018 ). In this regard, Ricciolini et al. (2022)  noted that the political dimension could affect the choice of weights. Since our analysis was aimed at comparing economic SDGs with economic growth, and considering that among the 35 indicators selected is GDP per capita, this indicator was disregarded. The revised indicator of economic SDGs was compared with the following indicators: Final consumption expenditure of households, Exports-Imports of goods and services, Employments, Labour productivity, Unit labour costs, Gross value added and Gross fixed capital. Also this choice was taken in accordance with the available indicators provided by Eurostat.1  1 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/namq_10_esms.htm .    3 Results 3.1 Assessment of economic SDG performance in European countries The first result of this study is to identify a single value for the 27 European countries by considering the contribution of all indicators related to the economic SDGs. The final value is obtained by assigning to each indicator the same relevance, through the average, and by normalization. The new indicator captures economic aspects of sustainability that GDP does not. GDP therefore no longer has a weight of 1.00, but within this work it has a weight of around 0.03 (obtained from the ratio between 1 and number of indicators). The results proposed in Fig. 1   (and Table A17 ) show a trend that tends not to deviate over the last 5 years. In fact, there is an almost perfect correlation between the values recorded in 2019 and those of the period 2015–2019. The same is verified also for GDP per capita as proposed in Fig. 2   (and Table A18 ). Northern and Western Europe is the one that presents the best performing values with Sweden presenting the highest value with 0.720 followed by Denmark (0.689), Netherlands (0.655) and Finland (0.648). In order to understand the determinants of this result, it is possible to break down the results according to the individual SDGs and thus see if a country performs well in all of them. Figs. 3–4    (and Table A19 ) show that this is not the case, pointing at differences across the various economic SDGs. Specifically, countries have been divided in accordance with the following approach: countries that have a value above the European average (U) and countries that have a value below that average (D). Within these two macro groups, countries that outperform the European average in each SDG are then identified. Denmark and Austria are the only two countries to achieve this result and are classified in the ranking as U5. Analyzing the leading countries in the general ranking, both Sweden and Finland are U4 because they are both below the European average in SDG 12. It is worth noting that the two countries are top-ranked in SDG 7 (Sweden) and SDG 11 (Finland). Conversely, the Netherlands ranks first in the other three SDGs considered, but scores below the European average in SDGs 7 and 11 - and therefore is classified U3. Eleven countries are above the EU 27 average: Ireland, Germany, Belgium, France and Luxembourg are also among the U4 and Slovenia among the U3. In terms of non-performing countries, Spain and Malta are classified D2, meaning that in 2 SDGs they are below the European average, while Lithuania, Poland, Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria have a weak performance in all 5 SDGs (D5). The map presented in Fig. 3  therefore shows that, from a geographical point of view, Countries located in the Northern and Center Europe seem to pay more attention to the achievement of sustainable targets, when compared to Countries located in the South and East Europe. Fig. 4  indicates some interesting aspects that complete the provided analysis. In particular, it underlines the heterogeneous nature of European territories, where each country can be particularly virtuous in an SDG and weak in anothers. For example, in SDG7 Sweden, Denmark and Latvia reached the best results and Lithuania, Cyprus and Luxemburg the worst ones. In SDG 8 Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark are the countries with the best performance whereas Bulgaria, Greece and Romania are in a critical situation. Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden assume good values in SDG 9 and Greece, Cyprus and Bulgaria are at the end of the ranking. In SDG 11 Finland, Ireland and Estonia excel whereas Greece, Romania and Bulgaria remain below. Finally, Netherland strongly stands out in SDG 12 followed by France and Italy, while Lithuania, Estonia and Bulgaria stand at the opposite side of the spectrum. Moving at a finer grain of analysis, we consider how many countries tend to perform best in each indicator. To do this, the average value is considered through normalized values and when it tends towards a high value, it indicates that there are a majority of countries performing well. Figure A1  shows that these indicators are: i) Generation of waste excluding major mineral wastes by hazardousness; ii) Long-term unemployment rate; iii) Air emission intensity from industry and iv) Population unable to keep home adequately warm by poverty status. Instead, there are significant differences among countries in the following indicators: i) Real GDP per capita; ii) Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, transport and iii) Patent applications to the European Patent Office. The next phase of the work turns to calculating the new revised indicator of the economic SDGs, i.e. composed of 34 indicators not considering the GDP per capita indicator [SDG_08_10]. From a numerical point of view, the value of the overall indicator varies by a maximum of 0.013 and therefore a limited variation is registered (Table A20  - Figure A2 ). However, it should be noted that only two countries (Luxembourg and Ireland) show a decrease in their value and this is because they have a GDP per capita that is much higher than the other European countries. This data recalls a report by the European Commission, which shows that “the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Singapore host more than 85% of global investments in special purpose companies, which are often established for tax reasons”.2  2 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2019-0240_EN.html .    3.2 Nexus between the indicator of the economic SDGs and economic growth The various indicators proposed to measure economic sustainability not only affect one dimension of sustainability but also generate effects on the other two pillars. To understand the importance of this set of indicators, it is possible to compare the indicator obtained from MCDA with the most classic of economic indicators, GDP per capita. The analysis is obtained considering the 5 reference years and the 27 European countries, for a total of 135 observations. Figure A3  shows that the R2  is 0.5376 and there is an exponential relationship. Revised multicriteria value is the x variable, while GDP per capita is the y variable. Analysis of Figure A3  shows that 5 values are outlier and all correspond to Luxembourg. To this end, we reduce the sample to 130 observations and observe a higher R2  than the previous one (0.6431) with a relationship that this time is linear (Figure A4 ). However, this analysis also shows that there are an additional 5 outliers, corresponding this time to Ireland. Removing these additional 5 points leads to a third scenario of 125 observations, with an R2  now reaching 0.7259 (Fig. 5  ). R2   represents the variation in the values of y that can be justified by the variation in x and the result obtained indicates that there is a strong correlation. So, if for instance the revised multicriteria value is equal to 0.500, the corresponding GDP per capita will be equal to approximately 21.50 k€ (obtained from 106.24*0.500–31.615). This result shows that GDP per capita – which is certainly simpler to calculate than the revised multicriteria value – captures the performance of around three quarters of the indicator of the economic SDGs. However, it must be stressed that this result does not indicate that GDP per capita is more important than the others and, in this regard, there are two considerations to be made. First that there is no strong difference between the multicriteria value and the revised multicriteria value; second that in the calculation of the multicriteria value, the GDP per capita indicator was given equal importance with respect to the other indicators. Some authors discuss the abuse of GDP as a measure of public welfare (Giannetti et al., 2015 ). In particular, GDP was designed to measure production capacity and economic growth, not to assess well-being (Kapoor and Debroy, 2019 ). The relationship between multicriteria value and GDP per capita was also evaluated, and there is no change from previous reasoning with the R2  value increasing by approximately 0.03 (Figures A5-A7 ). Table A21  shows all the relationships between multicriteria value and the main economic indicators (Figures A8-A14 ). As it seems, there is low correlation of multicriteria values with some indicators (exports-imports of goods and services, employment, labor productivity and unit labor costs). It has a medium correlation with the final consumption expenditure of households (showing an R2  equal to 0.5588) and very high correlations are recorded for gross value added and gross fixed capital (respectively 0.7363 and 0.7388 in the scenario in which Luxembourg and Ireland are not considered). The last analysis conducted in this work aimed at evaluating whether the indicator of the economics SDGs provided a similar ranking to that which was obtained through GDP per capita given the strong correlation underlined. Table 1   shows this comparison which is proposed not for a single year of reference but considering the entire period under examination. The results show that the new indicator obtained through multicriteria captures various nuances that GDP per capita cannot provide. Thus, it is evident that Sweden is slightly ahead of Denmark, but Finland also gains important positions. However, the most significant leap is made by Slovenia, which turns out to be the only country that exceeds the European average in multicriteria value with respect to GDP per capita. On the other hand, Luxembourg loses ten positions while Ireland loses four position in the overall ranking. Moreover, two Mediterranean countries (Italy and Greece) are below the European GDP per capita average, but in the multicriteria value rank way better.   4 Discussion and conclusions Sustainability is sometimes a brand with which one aims to gain consensus, to show that there is attention to this great current challenge. However, sustainability also refers to ethical values, which can change according to, for example, one's religious faith, but which find a common point in the respect of certain values. As we believe, sustainability does not belong to the selfish. It is a way of life, an approach to pass on to future generations so that their dreams can come true . The challenge is so complex, so multidisciplinary, that it is extremely difficult to give summary directions. The multicriteria analysis performed in this paper helps in pursuing this challenging goal. We have introduced an indicator whose values are based on objective data and whose weights are considered the same. For some categories of stakeholders, the weight of some indicators could be more relevant and this would obviously modify the ranking obtained. This denotes a limitation of this work; however, in future works, alternative scenarios should still be compared with those of the baseline scenario here developed, that considers only economic perspective. In fact, the analysis could be extended to the other two pillars of sustainability not analyzed in this paper (social and environmental). In such a case, the increase of the number of indicators considered could lead to the need to analyze different weights, to be evaluated with quantitative methodologies, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Likert Scale. An additional problem is to compare values as a function of target values, so that the limitation associated with the normalization process is mitigated. As showed by our findings, in spite the strong correlation between GDP per capita and our multicriteria indicator, when it comes to cross-countries comparisons several differences emerge in the ranking of relative performances. Specifically, some countries that rank particularly high in terms of GDP per capita, have poorer performances when considering the multicriteria indicator. Conversely, other countries confirm their leading position in both rankings. As it seems, economic growth can be pro-sustainability or not – this depending on what triggers growth. Economic growth triggered by tax havens does not move in the same direction of economic sustainability as defined and captured by SDGs (see the case of Luxemburg and Ireland). On the contrary, economic growth can move in the sustainability direction if it is inclusive and faire (see the case of Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands and Austria). Hence, reconciling economic growth with sustainability needs deeper reflections along this line of reasoning and growth drivers should be aligned with sustainability targets. Sustainability indicates a new way of conceiving the economic system: in the current period, some activities can be less convenient because they are based on the use of raw materials, production processes that are, from a financial point of view (i.e. based only on cash flows) more convenient. However, if the analysis is extended to an economic profile (based on a cost-benefit analysis, which includes the cost of externalities) we arrive at different results because we can incorporate different parameters. Some examples are the cost of pollution, the cost of citizen discomfort due to natural disasters and what is called "do nothing cost", that is associated to not implementing a green revolution. It should be noted that the political side with the NGEU has set itself with ambition towards these goals by introducing important new funds, but even before COVID-19, the European Green Deal represented a strategy of inclusive and sustainable growth. Political programs must lead Europe in all its areas to evolve towards this transition, and support must be given to those areas that are currently the most disadvantaged. However, a correct balance is required because resources cannot be taken away from virtuous countries to be directed to those who will not achieve effective change. In this direction, it is important to monitor the time values of these countries and the results of this work have shown that from 2015 to 2019 there were no significant variations. A change that cannot be separated from a more responsible consumption, in which future generations seem to be highly inclined towards the purchase of sustainable products. However, purchase intentions do not always turn into purchase actions and therefore knowledge, also based on numerical relationships, is able to photograph current situations, find relationships between variables and indicate potential future directions towards a sustainable goal. Another policy direction that emerges from this work is grounded on the idea that the economic development of Europe is the result of development patterns of all European countries; therefore, it would be valuable to encourage best practice exchanges among European countries. At the same time, Europe is asked to promote support for the poorest countries on the planet, allowing them to improve their living conditions because sustainability is only achieved through global progress. In order to achieve this challenging objective, it is necessary to promote the concept of shared value and extend it not only to support future generations but also to those who today have fewer opportunities for growth. Sustainable economic development calls for immediate responses, in which the objectives of COP26 must push policy makers to limit the economic speculation of some big players who base their interests on an improper use of natural resources resulting in social impoverishment, globally.
