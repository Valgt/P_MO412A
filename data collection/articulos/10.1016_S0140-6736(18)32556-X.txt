By many measures, modern humanity enjoys better health than earlier generations.1   But the benefits of modern health care are not accessible to all. Even as the incidence of infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria are reduced, many countries struggle to cope with the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, and the complex and growing health needs of ageing populations.2,3   The Declaration of Alma-Ata in 19784   was the first international call for primary health care as the main strategy for achieving universal health coverage, otherwise known as “health for all”. Guided by its values of equity, solidarity, and social justice, signatories to the Declaration of Alma-Ata agreed that all people in all countries have a fundamental right to health, and that governments are responsible for upholding that right.4   The vision of the Declaration of Alma-Ata was to change how we think about health and move away from hospitals, professionals, and disease, and towards a recognition that health is not only about illness and services but also about the social, economic, and environmental factors that affect the health of individuals and populations. Thought about this way, health services are designed and delivered in response to the expressed needs and expectations of individuals and communities, and are easily accessible where people live and work. 40 years later, that vision has gone largely unfulfilled. Realisation of the vision and values set forth in the Declaration of Alma-Ata has been hampered by inadequate political leadership and circumstances beyond the health sector (eg, economic crises and political instability) and within the health sector (eg, global epidemics, vertical disease-specific approaches, unregulated private health care, and overinvestment in specialised curative care). The 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Alma-Ata is a time to reaffirm the principles of the original declaration and underline the importance of primary health care for achieving health and wellbeing for all. The anniversary also provides an opportunity to revitalise primary health care, bringing to bear the potential of innovation and technology and empowering young people to participate more meaningfully in their own health. Primary health care is based on three pillars: community empowerment, multisectoral policies and action, and integrated delivery of quality primary care and public health services. With good design and delivery, primary health care provided to all—irrespective of who they are or where they are from—can effectively meet most health needs people encounter throughout their lives. Decades of evidence show that health systems developed around strong primary health care deliver better health outcomes at a lower cost, and can mitigate the impact of poor economic conditions on health.5   High-quality primary health care is the best platform for responding to evolving health needs, demographics, environmental challenges, and emergencies.6   Strong primary health care, rooted in community participation and action, is the foundation of every health system, and no country can achieve health for all without it. Investing in primary health care will support tangible improvements in health and wellbeing and drive progress towards achievement of the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. Achieving health for all and ensuring health care that is truly universal requires a renewed focus on quality primary health care that is designed around people. We are meeting at the Global Conference on Primary Health Care in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Oct 25–26, 2018, to recall and build on the original Alma-Ata vision, and embrace lessons learned since 1978. A new commitment, the Declaration of Astana, developed with the input of UN member states, will call for primary health care that puts people at the centre of health systems, instead of diseases, institutions, donor objectives, or vertical funding streams. We must transform this vision into a practical reality for the benefit and development of humankind.
