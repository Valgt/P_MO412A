                  Fire is a ubiquitous natural disturbance that affects 3–4% of the Earth's surface each year. It is a tool used by humans for land clearing and burning of agricultural wastes. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) do not explicitly mention fire, though many of the Goals are affected by the beneficial and adverse consequences of fires on ecosystem services. There are at least three compelling reasons to include a fire perspective in the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The first reason relates to the stated vision of the United Nations 2030 Agenda to protect the environment. In order to achieve environmental protection during sustainable development activities, it is necessary to understand and plan for the effects of disturbances, in this case fire, on ecosystem services. The second reason is that fires produce emissions with regional and global impacts on air quality and rainfall patterns. Fires contribute to global warming though the release greenhouse gases, primarily CO2, and black carbon, identified as a SLCP (short-lived climate pollutant). The third reason is that fire is one of several complex processes that lead to land degradation across the globe. Opportunities exist to incorporate a fire perspective into sustainable development projects or approaches. Two examples are highlighted here. Transdisciplinary communication and collaboration are needed to address the complex issues related to fire, and to climate and land use change.

It is a tool used by humans for land clearing and burning of agricultural wastes. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) do not explicitly mention fire, though many of the Goals are affected by the beneficial and adverse consequences of fires on ecosystem services. There are at least three compelling reasons to include a fire perspective in the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The first reason relates to the stated vision of the United Nations 2030 Agenda to protect the environment. In order to achieve environmental protection during sustainable development activities, it is necessary to understand and plan for the effects of disturbances, in this case fire, on ecosystem services. The second reason is that fires produce emissions with regional and global impacts on air quality and rainfall patterns. Fires contribute to global warming though the release greenhouse gases, primarily CO2 , and black carbon, identified as a SLCP (short-lived climate pollutant). The third reason is that fire is one of several complex processes that lead to land degradation across the globe. Opportunities exist to incorporate a fire perspective into sustainable development projects or approaches. Two examples are highlighted here. Transdisciplinary communication and collaboration are needed to address the complex issues related to fire, and to climate and land use change.

Fire is a ubiquitous, complex ecosystem disturbance determined by the interaction of the biosphere and climate (Carmona-Moreno et al., 2005 ; Harrison et al., 2010 ; Harris et al., 2016 ). Fire is strongly affected by human activities such as land clearing, ecosystem fragmentation, burning of agricultural wastes, collection of firewood and fire suppression (Harrison et al., 2010 ; Harris et al., 2016 ). Though the United Nations 2030 Agenda (United Nations, 2015 ) does not use the term “fire” explicitly, several of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are affected by fire-related alterations to ecosystem services, those services provided by ecosystems that benefit human well-being (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ; Fischlin et al., 2007 ). For this discussion, fire consists of a myriad of biomass combustion activities including uncontrolled wildfires, bushfires, grassland fires and peat fires (Turetsky et al., 2015 ), and intentional fires used for land clearing, charcoal production, and the burning of agricultural residues (Table 1  ). The effects on humans and the environment from the combustion of wood, crop residues, dung, charcoal, and coal used for heating and cooking fires are not addressed in this discussion. At least three compelling reasons exist to promote a broader fundamental understanding of the relationship between the United Nations' SDGs and fire among policy makers, the public and scientists from disparate disciplines. The first reason is that in order to optimize opportunities to protect and enhance ecosystem services that contribute to SDGs, a fundamental understanding of the effects of the alteration of these services by disturbance, including fire, is required. The second is that fires exert effects on regional and global air quality thus extending these effects beyond the geographical boundaries of the area burned. Fires release greenhouse gases, primarily CO2 , and black carbon, identified as a SLCP (short-lived climate pollutant) that contribute to global warming (Haines et al., 2017 ; Lowe and Bernie, 2018 ). The third reason is that fire is one of several complex processes that lead to land degradation across the globe (Neary, 2009 ; Kosmas et al., 2014 ; Miao et al., 2016 ; Cherlet et al., 2018 ). Achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, 2016 ) is one of the targets in the SDGs (United Nations, 2015 ). An adequate understanding of basic principles related to fire and its effects on ecosystems will facilitate communication across disciplinary and geographical boundaries, and thus promote the development of mechanisms needed to achieve the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and create resiliency to changing global conditions. The objective of this discussion is to encourage a broad transdisciplinary audience to incorporate a fire perspective into their deliberations and actions related to the United Nations 2030 Agenda by providing insights into the linkages between fire and the SDGs. This examination provides a brief background on fire activity across the globe and a discussion of fire effects on the regulating ecosystem services that pertain to air quality, water quality, rainfall patterns, and soils linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Two examples of projects or approaches that consider SDGs and incorporate a fire perspective are highlighted. In conclusion, effects of changing climate and land use change on fire activity are summarized and the next steps needed to fully incorporate a fire perspective into sustainable development projects are explored  2 Fire activity across the globe Fires burn in all major biomes across the globe (Keywood et al., 2013 ; Melchiorre and Boschetti, 2018 ; Fig. 1  ). Though some discrepancies exist in estimates of area burned based on different prognostic fire models and remote sensing platforms (Andela et al., 2017 ; Humber et al., 2018 ), a widely-cited figure is that about 400 million ha are burned annually, comprising 3–4% of the Earth's vegetated surface (Randerson et al., 2012 ; Giglio et al., 2013 ; Chuvieco et al., 2016 ; Santín and Doerr, 2016 ; Andela et al., 2017 ; Archibald et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2018 ). Considerable spatial and temporal variations exist in annual area burned each year (Giglio et al., 2010 ; Bistinas et al., 2014 ). Over the 20-year period from 1997 to 2016, fires were most extensive in regions dominated by savannas, grasslands and shrublands (van der Werf et al., 2017 ). Tropical savannas of South America and Africa and Asian steppes have experienced a decline in fire activity as a result of land use changes and agricultural practices (Ichoku et al., 2016 ; Andela et al., 2017 ; Arora and Melton, 2018 ; Ward et al., 2018 ) while fire activity has intensified in China and India from crop residue burning (Earl and Simmonds, 2018 ). In its most fundamental form, fire transforms fuels in the presence of oxygen to complex gases and residues. Three components must be present for fires to burn: 1.) fuel, comprised of a variety of biomass materials including trees, branches, leaves or needles, grass, soil organic matter, peat, agricultural residues and dung, 2.) an ignition source and 3.) conditions that are conducive to burning (Krawchuk et al., 2009 ; Moritz et al., 2012 ; Forkel et al., 2017 ; Table 1 , Fig. 2  ). Balch et al. (2018)  term these components “switches”. Additional factors that determine the location and effects of the various fires on humans and ecosystems are the type of fire (e.g., uncontrolled versus intentional fire), the type of fuel and its arrangement and connectivity (e.g. is the fuel mainly in a tree canopy or is it distributed in piles or windrows awaiting burning after pruning or harvesting activities), type of combustion (flaming or smoldering), and several factors used to describe components of the “fire regime” of vegetation fires including the seasonality of burning, fire intensity and severity, fire behavior, fire size, fire frequency and a whole host of other complexities (Bond and Keeley, 2005 ; Bowman et al., 2009 ; Keeley, 2009 ; Keeley et al., 2009 ; Archibald et al., 2013 ; Scott et al., 2014 ; Archibald et al., 2018 ). These variables determine, in turn, which gases, aerosols and particulates are released to the atmosphere (Voulgarakis and Field, 2015 ), what residues are left behind as ash and partially charred material (Bodí et al., 2014 ; Plumlee et al., 2014 ; Zaccone et al., 2014 ), and what effects fires exert on ecosystems and the services they provide. Fires affect all four categories of ecosystem services defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) : provisioning, supporting, regulation and cultural services (Table 2  ).  3 Fire effects on ecosystem services and links to SDGs Fire is an ecological force that shapes ecosystems and influences biogeochemical cycles (Bowman et al., 2013 ), including the carbon cycle (Reichstein et al., 2013 ; Bird et al., 2015 ; Santín et al., 2015b ; Landry and Mathews, 2017 ; Abney and Berhe, 2018 ; Harrison et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2018 ), and the use of fire by humans is one of our identifying characteristics (Gowlett, 2016 ). In fire-adapted ecosystems, fire is an essential process that releases nutrients, modifies competition and influences plant community composition, and the suppression of fire in these systems leads to adverse long-term effects (Bond and Keeley, 2005 ). Because humans derive benefits from optimally-functioning ecosystems, fire has a clear beneficial role in these systems. For example, the beneficial effects of fire in tropical dry forests include the improvement of hunting and fishing opportunities, the production of fodder, the creation of pasture lands, additional security from wild animals, an increase in agricultural productivity, the supply of a large range of non-wood forest products (e.g. roots, leaves, firewood, and medicinal plants) and enhanced cultural opportunities (Schmerbeck and Fiener, 2015 , and references contained therein). Yet fires have negative aspects; they can affect air quality while they burn and bring about changes in the land surface that can lead to desertification, land degradation, impacts on water supplies, and changes in rainfall patterns (Tosca et al., 2013 ; Johnston et al., 2016 ; Miao et al., 2016 ; Mirzabaev et al., 2016 ; Nunes et al., 2018b ; Cherlet et al., 2018 ). One framework that can be used to evaluate fire impacts as they relate to SDGs is through fire's effects on ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ; Fischlin et al., 2007 ; Chuvieco et al., 2014 ; Brockerhoff et al., 2017 ; Table 2 ). The ecosystem services framework directly applies to achieving Land Degradation Neutrality defined by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) as “a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remain stable or increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems” (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, 2016 ; Cherlet et al., 2018 ). Fire, particularly through its effects on ecosystem regulation services related to air quality, soil, water, and rainfall patterns (considered a climate regulation service by the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment), can be explicitly linked to seven of the SDGs: Goal 1 (no poverty), Goal 2 (zero hunger), Goal 3 (good health and well-being), Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), Goal 13 (climate action), Goal 14 (life below water) and Goal 15 (life on land) (Table 3  ). Applying the broadest perspective, it is reasonable to consider that fire and its consequences affect all 17 Goals given the transboundary nature of air quality and climatic and land use changes. Using a model that includes fire impacts on a subset of ecosystem services, including a.) provisioning of food, fiber, and fuel, b.) recreation, and c.) the regulating service of carbon sequestration plus potential impacts on ecological values (biodiversity, conservation status and habitat fragmentation) and houses and infrastructure, Chuvieco et al. (2014)  estimate that 65% of the Earth has high or very high vulnerability to fire. According to Wood et al. (2018) , practical strategies to achieve sustainable development while protecting the environment are not clearly specified. Wood et al. (2018)  advocate that those implementing sustainable development projects need to understand the role of ecosystem services in their projects and how the services are affected by human activities in order to properly plan for and manage those potential services. 3.1 Fire effects on air quality and links to SDGs The regulation of air quality is one of the services provided by ecosystems. Fire effects on air quality can affect multiple SDGs (Table 3 ). While fires are burning, they release particulates and volatile gases (Sommers et al., 2014 ; Knorr et al., 2017 ; van der Werf et al., 2017 ; Fann et al., 2018 ; Hu et al., 2018 ; Latif et al., 2018 ; Ward et al., 2018 ). These emissions have short- and long-term effects on global warming (Voulgarakis and Field, 2015 ) and as such can be linked to SDG 13 (climate action). Since fire releases carbon in the form of gases and particulates, the carbon sequestration function of ecosystems as that relates to the regulation of air quality is also perturbed (Díaz et al., 2018 ). The combustion products of fire have direct and long-term effects on human health (Johnston et al., 2016 ; Capistrano et al., 2017 ; Cascio, 2018 ) and the environment (Biswas et al., 2008 ; Bondar et al., 2014 ), issues that pertain primarily to SDGs 3 (good health and well-being), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 13 (climate action) and 14 (life below water). Direct health effects include respiratory issues, deaths, and lower fetal and infant survival rates (Jayachandran, 2009 ; Cascio, 2018 ; Fann et al., 2018 ). Significant health, albedo and economic impacts have been linked to transboundary haze produced by specific fire episodes, such as the 1997, 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2015 peatland fires in Southeast Asia (Jaafar and Loh, 2014 ; Atwood et al., 2016 ; Huijnen et al., 2016 ; Koplitz et al., 2016 ; Hu et al., 2018 ), the 2006 Arctic haze episode resulting from agricultural fires and associated forest fires in Eastern Europe (Stohl et al., 2007 ) and western United States wildfires during 2008–2012 (Fann et al., 2018 ). Gases and particulates released during fires in Southeast Asia were assumed to impact downwind marine ecosystems (Jaafar and Loh, 2014 ); thus, fires can be linked to impacts on SDG 14 (Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development).  3.2 Fire effects on water in the context of SDGs Control of water quality and mediation of stream flows are two of the regulating ecosystem services provided by vegetated catchments. The yield of water from these catchments is classified as a provisioning service by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) . Through its effects on vegetation and soils (discussed below), fires alter how rain or snow moves through burned catchments and change the availability and character of the materials (sediment and ash) that can be entrained in surface flow from hillslopes (Nyman et al., 2013b ; Bodí et al., 2014 ; Murphy et al., 2018 ). Base flows and peak flows are affected in burned catchments for up to 15 years after fire (Kinoshita and Hogue, 2015 ; Saxe et al., 2018 ) though there are regional differences in this pattern (Brookhouse et al., 2013 ; Hallema et al., 2018 ; Wine et al., 2018 ). In those cases where peak runoff and base flow are observed to increase for two years or longer after fire, the increased runoff is mainly because larger amounts of precipitation that fall in a catchment are converted to streamflow rather than being used by vegetation. As vegetation regrows, runoff tends to return to typical levels as a result of increasing transpiration by the plants. A different pattern is observed in catchments in Australia dominated by Eucalypts that regenerate from seed (mainly Eucalyptus regnans  and Eucalyptus delegatensis ). These catchments exhibit decreased water yield for at least two decades after fire (Brookhouse et al., 2013 ). Post-fire peak runoff from catchments burned by fire has been documented to be 0–900 times that of pre-fire flow (Neary et al., 2005 ). Underlying reasons for extreme flows are the same as those for increased post-fire water quality effects, i.e. loss of water storage capacity on the landscape and changes in soil hydraulic properties (Ebel and Moody, 2013, 2017 ). The topic of fire effects on water quality has been well covered in the scientific literature (Smith et al., 2011 ; Emelko et al., 2011 ; Bladon et al., 2014 ; Abraham et al., 2017 ; Nunes et al., 2018b ; Robinne et al., 2018 ; Rust et al., 2018 ). One of the main reasons for altered stream water chemistry is that fires modify a.) components of the landscape that store incoming precipitation (e.g. tree canopies and the litter layer covering the soil surface) and b.) modify soil hydraulic properties (Ebel and Moody, 2013, 2017 ). These changes lead to a shift to overland flow on hillslopes in response to rainfall, a flow path that mobilizes ash and soil and conveys those components to stream, lakes and reservoirs (Abney and Berhe, 2018 ; Murphy et al., 2018 ). Charcoal (black carbon) produced during combustion can be transported in post-fire erosion events (Rumpel et al., 2006 ; Abney and Berhe, 2018 ), and moved through streams and rivers to the ocean, and eventually incorporated into oceanic sediments (Reichstein et al., 2013 ; Bird et al., 2015 ; Santín et al., 2015a ; Landry and Mathews, 2017 ; Harrison et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2018 ). In those catchments that experience snowmelt as part of the hydrologic cycle, high discharge can erode stream banks and mobilize sediments stored in floodplains (Silins et al., 2009 ; Murphy et al., 2018 ). The literature on fire effects on lakes, reservoirs and groundwater is minimal so we know much less about the impacts of fire disturbance on these landscape components (Martin, 2016 ). Water scarcity is a pressing global issue (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ; Hoekstra et al., 2012 ; World Economic Forum, 2015 ; Kinoshita et al., 2016 ; Martin, 2016 ; Robinne et al., 2018 ). In 2005 the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimated that half of the world's population would live in water-stressed basins by 2025 (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ). Fires can lead to impairment of water for its intended use and this impairment can be considered a type of water scarcity (Schyns et al., 2015 ; Martin, 2016 ). Sustainable Development Goal 6 is focused on the availability and sustainable management of water and the restoration of “water-related ecosystems” including forests (United Nations, 2015 ). Given the potential effects of fire on water yield, water quality and the modified regulation of extreme flows, there is a clear need to consider fire and its effects on sustainable development projects at least on local scales.  3.3 Fire effects on rainfall patterns and potential links to SDGs Fires affect the regulation of local and regional atmospheric conditions. Modeling experiments have demonstrated that aerosols or smoke particles from landscape fires can modify atmospheric heating and circulation and thence precipitation patterns, a result consistent with observations of the expansion of tropical regions (Tosca et al., 2013 ; Lucas et al., 2014 ). An expansion of the tropical regions has profound implications for semi-arid areas of the Earth's surface immediately poleward of the tropical belt and adjacent subtropical zones, with more significant drought expected in these semi-arid regions that include the Mediterranean, the U.S. Southwest and northern Mexico, southern Australia, southern Africa and portions of South America (Seidel et al., 2008 ). Agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa is primarily fed by rainfall and shifts in the timing and location of rain affect food production (SDG 2) and exacerbate poverty (SDG 1) (Keys and Falkenmark, 2018 ). The consequences of shifting rainfall patterns on the implementation of SDGs has received only slight attention (Keys and Falkenmark, 2018 ).  3.4 Fire effects on soil and soil erosion and links to SDGs Fires can affect soils directly through the combustion of the protective surface organic layer, and the alteration of soil organic matter and soil minerals (Neary et al., 2005 ; Moody et al., 2013 ; Santín and Doerr, 2016 ). These heating effects on soils change how water infiltrates into the soil and runoff generation during rainfall (Larsen et al., 2009 ; Ebel and Moody, 2013 ; Moody and Ebel, 2014 ; Ebel and Moody, 2017 ) and increases the susceptibility of the soils to erosion by wind and runoff (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006 ; Ravi et al., 2007 ; Mataix-Solera et al., 2011 ). Post-fire debris flows, destructive sediment-laden flows, have been documented for the western United States (Cannon and DeGraff, 2009 ), Australia (Nyman et al., 2011 ), and Canada (Jordan, 2015 ). The combustion of above- and below-ground organic matter affects nutrient availability and cycling (Neary et al., 1999 ; Certini, 2005 ; Raison et al., 2009 ). Soils and their ecosystem services play a clear role in several SDGs (Keesstra et al., 2016 ; Lal et al., 2018 ; Tóth et al., 2018 ). In their discussion of soil-related SDGs, Keesstra et al. (2016)  identify fire as a potential risk in abandoned Mediterranean agricultural and pastoral landscapes that have regrown with trees and shrubs. When these landscapes burn, soil erosion, water pollution and changes in landscape and soil properties can result (Cerdà and Lasanta, 2005 ; Keesstra et al., 2016 ). Fires reduce carbon storage of soils by combusting soil organic matter, especially during high-severity fires (Bormann et al., 2008 ; Santín et al., 2015a ). On the other hand, charcoal that gets incorporated into soils after fire is a carbon sink over time scales of weeks to millennia (Bird et al., 2015 ). Fires have been identified as one of the factors promoting desertification and land degradation (Neary, 2009 ; Kosmas et al., 2014 ; Miao et al., 2016 ; Cherlet et al., 2018 ). Desertification and land degradation are processes of particular concern relative to Sustainable Development Goal 1 (no poverty), Goal 2 (zero hunger), Goal 3 (good health and well-being) and Goal 15 (life on land). Desertification is defined by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, 1994 ) as land degradation in drylands, those areas of the globe that have a ratio of mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential (the Aridity Idex, AI) of 0.05 to 0.65 (Middleton and Thomas, 1997 ; Maestre et al., 2012 ), caused by human activities and climate. Drylands occupy approximately 5.2 billion hectares, about 40% of the globe's land area (Reynolds et al., 2007 ), and over 38% of the Earth's population lives in these areas (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ; Maestre et al., 2012 ; Middleton and Sternberg, 2013 ). These areas have high levels of poverty and are considered to be particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, rainfall patterns and land use (Barbier and Hochard, 2016 ). Land degradation affects ecological, hydrological and biochemical processes in drylands resulting in the loss of productivity and complexity (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, 1994 ; Reynolds et al., 2007 ). The beneficial effects of fires to release nutrients, stimulate the growth of palatable biomass and control weedy vegetation are well recognized, but fires that are too frequent or intense can promote desertification (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 ).   4 Examples of sustainable development projects that apply a fire perspective There are examples of approaches that have considered a fire perspective in the design of projects or approaches to achieve SDGs. Two are highlighted here. The first is a program in India sponsored by the government of the state of Andhra Pradesh, called Zero Budget Natural Farming (Tripathi et al., 2018 ). Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) is described as a climate resilient farming method that eliminates the use of artificial fertilizers and industrial pesticides. This approach is seen as a way to help India make progress toward achieving the SDGs (Tripathi et al., 2018 ). The burning of crop residues in India has been identified as having significant impacts on air quality across India including the impacts from black carbon aerosols that affect climate, human health, precipitation and soil productivity (Burney and Ramanathan, 2014 ; Jain et al., 2014 ; Sakar et al., 2018 , and references contained therein). The Zero Budget Natural Farming program in Andhra Pradesh strives to address SDG 13 (Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts) by educating farmers about the effects of crop burning on climate change and by offering the “poorest of the poor” farmers one-time 50% financial support to make the transition to ZBNF (Tripathi et al., 2018 ). Though the ZBNF project was originally introduced in 2015, the government of Andhra Pradesh announced a plan in June 2018 to convert 6 million farms/farmers to 100% ZBNF by 2024 (United Nations Environment Programme, 2018 ). Plans are being developed to measure, report, and verify greenhouse gases and other environmental impacts of climate-resilient ZBNF practices in Andhra Pradesh (Coalition on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases, 2017 ) so data will become available eventually to verify the effectiveness of the proposed reductions in crop residue burning. The second example is an analysis of the potential reduction in the release of greenhouse gases accomplished through the transition from late season burning in savanna areas to early season burning, a reduction that would help fire-prone savanna countries meet SDGs (Lipsett-Moore et al., 2018 ). Early season burning fires tend to be smaller, less intense and thereby release fewer emissions based on results from the Western Arnhem Land Fire Abatement project in Australia over the ten-year period 1994–2005 (Russell-Smith et al., 2017 ; Beringer et al., 2015 ). During that period mean annual greenhouse emissions were reduced by >37% by adding about 12% more land area to the early season burning regime and reducing the late season burned area by 21%. The analysis by Lipsett-Moore et al. (2018)  included 50 countries in the savanna biome and demonstrated that emissions could potentially be reduced in 37 countries, including 20 countries in Africa that are considered to be the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and therefore need the most support for implementing climate change mitigation measures to increase resiliency. Though the proposed shift from late season burning to early season burning appears to present a viable mitigation strategy, Lipsett-Moore et al. (2018)  report that as yet no fire prone savanna country currently includes early dry season burning in their climate mitigation efforts. In an exploration of potential measures to mitigate the emissions of SLCPs, Haines et al. (2017)  advocate the adoption of several measures, one of which is to ban open-field burning of agricultural wastes that releases black carbon during combustion. Haines et al. (2017)  suggest that integrating SLCP mitigation into the implementation of SDGs will yield many benefits, including a reduction of climate change-inducing carbon releases.  5 Using the fire framework to interpret fire complexity and pertinence to SDGs Despite attempts to discern patterns and similarities among fire regimes and post-fire responses (Moody et al., 2013 ; Nyman et al., 2013a ) in different geographical areas, there is a recognition that fire activity is extremely complex and is a function of interactions among multiple variables (Krawchuk et al., 2009 ; Jiménez-Ruano et al., 2017 ). The details of this complexity are not captured in the simple model presented above (Fig. 2 ; Krawchuk et al., 2009 ; Moritz et al., 2012 ) which does not include a.) frequency and seasonality of ignitions, b.) effects on ignitions from other factors such short-term increases in population during holidays (San-Miguel-Ayanz et al., 2013 ) and changes in population density (Knorr et al., 2014 ), and c.) land-use changes, for example land abandonment (López-Poma et al., 2014 ; Ursino and Romano, 2014 ), fire suppression (Pechony and Shindell, 2010 ), afforestation (Nunes et al., 2018a ), reburns (Prichard et al., 2017 ) and vegetation type conversion (Lee et al., 2015 ; Pelletier et al., 2015 ), that alter fuels, their characteristics and ecosystem states and functioning (Li et al., 2017 ). Challenges still remain in using this simple model and the concept of fire regimes to capture the variability in fire activity even in a relatively narrow geographical area (Murphy et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, effects of fire disturbance on ecosystem services, and thus the potential impacts on SDGs, operate over spatial and temporal scales that are as yet poorly defined. In the case of fire emissions, the impacts on air quality are at local, regional and global scales. Black carbon stays in the atmosphere for days to weeks, whereas CO2  has cumulative effects on atmospheric chemistry that are balanced by uptake of carbon uptake by the terrestrial ecosystems and oceans (Arora and Melton, 2018 ; Keenan and Williams, 2018 ). Effects fire on water (yield and quality) and soils span local to regional spatial scales and persist over temporal scales that range from weeks to decades (Certini, 2014 ; Hallema et al., 2018 ; Rhoades et al., 2018 ; Rust et al., 2018 ; Saxe et al., 2018 ; Wine et al., 2018 ). Applying the simple fire framework (Fig. 2 ) to some of the recent observations of fire activity and to the sustainable development approaches presented earlier does offer some insights to advance our understanding of the linkages between fire and the SDGs (Table 4  ). The framework can help explain the seeming paradox of the observed reduction in global area burned (e.g. Andela et al., 2017 ) on one hand and, on the other hand, the occurrence in 2017 of the largest fires in recorded history in California (National Interagency Fire Center, 2018 ; Balch et al., 2018 ) and Chile (Bowman et al., 2018 ; de la Barrera et al., 2018 ; Díaz et al., 2018 ). The fire framework specifies that three components are necessary for fires to burn: the presence of fuel, an ignition source and conditions conducive to support combustion. In the case of the observed reduction in global area burned, mainly as a result of decreased grassland and savanna burning (Andela et al., 2017 ), ignitions decreased and the fuel component was reduced by land fragmentation and changed land use. In the examples of the 2017 Chile and California fires, fuels increased in response to wet conditions in the previous growing season and subsequent conditions were hot and dry such that conditions were conducive to burning in response to the inevitable ignitions, mainly from human activities. For the highlighted examples from India (Tripathi et al., 2018 ) and savanna-rich countries (Lipsett-Moore et al., 2018 ), one of the desired outcomes is to reduce atmospheric emissions from burning activities and this reduction is intended to be accomplished by either eliminating ignitions or changing their seasonality. The relative importance of each component of the fire framework determines the outcome in terms of area burned, fire severity, emissions and effects of soils and thus the effects on the fires (or lack thereof) on ecosystem services.  6 Conclusions: changing climate, land use patterns and next steps Existing data and modeling efforts point to a future with higher temperatures, more extreme precipitation events and increasing aridity in many arid and semiarid regions (Pelletier et al., 2015 ; Jolly et al., 2015 ; Brown and Caldeira, 2017 ; Pfahl et al., 2017 ). The most recent IPCC assessment (IPCC, 2018 ) considers that the potential for increased fire risk is high if temperatures rise 1.5 °C above current conditions. Land use changes are affecting large parts of the globe (Song et al., 2018 ). Analyzing global land cover data for the period 1982 to 2016, Song et al. (2018)  document a >7% increase in tree cover and >3% decrease in bare ground cover. They highlight that these changes have significant implications for the Earth surface energy balance, the carbon cycle, the water cycle and species diversity and, as is clear from the studies cited earlier, global fire activity. Uncertainty exists as to whether future fire activity will produce warming or cooling effects on global temperatures (IPCC, 2014 ; Lowe and Bernie, 2018 ). This discussion identifies the effects of fire on several ecosystem services and examines the potential role fire plays in several SDGs. Based on existing scientific literature the strongest link between fire and SDGs is through fire's effects on air quality, carbon cycling, and soils. Clearly, fire and changing climate and land use are complex topics that profoundly influence the outcomes and success of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Making sense of this complexity requires us to communicate across transdisciplinary boundaries (Bouma, 2014 ). The need for interdisciplinary approaches to address SDGs is already recognized (Annan-Diab and Molinari, 2017 ; Salvia et al., 2018 ; Zielinski et al., 2018 ). Two international meetings focused on “Multidisciplinary Approaches on UN Sustainable Development Goals” have already been held (Arlai and Saeiaw, 2017 ; Arlai et al., 2017 ). Introducing a fire perspective into our deliberations about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals is a small step toward “collectively seeing complex systems” (Norgaard and Baer, 2005 ). As stated by Norgaard and Baer (2005 , p. 958), “Our future as a species depends on our ability to grapple with the complexities that arise in interactions between social and environmental systems. Seeing these problems requires the joining of expertise across scientific communities. Systems modeling and other formal approaches can help, yet our scientific understanding is ultimately dependent on collective processes of learning and understanding.” The in-depth analysis of the connection across several SDGs through their linkage to energy issues by McCollum et al. (2018)  emphasizes the role of the scientific community in identifying key relationships and filling knowledge gaps though cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration. McCollum et al. (2018)  describe the need for workshops and meetings for invited experts, stakeholders and a core team of scientists to achieve an “unprecedented scale” of knowledge sharing and collaboration to “translate scientific insights for policy-relevant decision making” (McCollum et al., 2018 , page 15). An example of this knowledge sharing was the first TERRAenVISION conference held early in 2018 in Barcelona, Spain, “Environmental Issues Today: Scientific Solutions for Societal Issues” (TERRAenVISION, 2018 ), which explored scientific challenges surrounding SDGs and effectively promoted learning about and understanding several complex issues, one of which was fire in the Earth system. A broadened fire perspective will contribute to an understanding of the synergies between the SDGs and other sustainable development and climate change mitigation initiatives such as REDD+ (Bastos Lima et al., 2017 ). REDD+ a collective term that refers to a country's efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and foster conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 2010 ). Barlow et al. (2012)  have previously highlighted the critical importance of including the knowledge of fire and its effects in the design and implementation of REDD+ programs. An international partnership, known as the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollution (CCAC), with a secretariat within the United Nation Environment Program (UNEP), already exists to catalyze action to reduce SLCPs (Haines et al., 2017 ). The author strongly advocates that we take the next steps to insert a more explicit fire perspective into the ongoing implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; fire and the Sustainable Development Goals are inextricably linked.
