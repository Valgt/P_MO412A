                  Land system science has gained prominence over the past few decades due to its role in promoting sustainable development. However, there are still key advancements needed to support land system science in meeting the challenges ahead and further contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. Therefore, this paper uses scientometrics to evaluate the development process of land system science and explore the challenges and weaknesses it faces. Our findings indicate that: (1) The number and citation frequency of land system science publications have been increasing in recent years; (2) Fields like "land use change", "systematic review", "machine learning", "agricultural land", and "environmental science" have gradually become research hotspots with the development and progress of land system science; (3) Land system science has gradually formed as an interdisciplinary subject, with increasing attention on human and environmental issues; (4) Contributions to land system science research mainly come from the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Germany, while China and Germany still need to strengthen their cooperation with other countries. Meanwhile, the imbalance in participation between the Global North and the Global South remains a significant challenge for global sustainable development; (5) The contribution of land systems science to the SDGs is primarily concentrated within the environment and society groups, including Climate Action (SDG 13), Life on Land (SDG 15), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Zero Hunger (SDG 02), as well as Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 06). This review highlights the significant potential of land system science in achieving SDGs and identifies key challenges that need to be addressed to advance the field.

Table 7    SDGs Targets Supported by LSS   01 No Poverty Target 1.1 LSS helps to identify areas with high poverty levels and offers insights into how land-use changes and sustainable land management practices can help uplift communities from poverty (FAO, 2019 ).  Target 1.4 Through investigating land tenure systems and land rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized populations, LSS aids in identifying fair and sustainable land governance mechanisms that can empower communities and ensure access to land and resources (Deininger, et al., 2012 ).  Target 1.5 LSS provides crucial information for designing climate-resilient land-use strategies and adaptation measures that can safeguard livelihoods and reduce vulnerability (Prestele, et al., 2017 ).  Target 1.a Through evaluating the impact of development interventions concerning land use and resource management, LSS assists policymakers in allocating resources efficiently to achieve poverty eradication goals (Dawson, et al., 2016 )  Target 1.b LSS identifies best practices, highlights policy gaps (Reed, et al., 2017 ), and proposes strategies that encourage pro-poor and gender-sensitive land-use policies and interventions.  02 Zero Hunger Target 2.1 Through analyzing the interactions between land use changes and food production systems, researchers can identify sustainable strategies to enhance agricultural productivity (Foley, et al., 2011 ).  Target 2.3 Through understanding land tenure systems and access to resources, policymakers can develop more precise interventions to support vulnerable groups and enhance their productivity and incomes (Deininger and Byerlee, 2011 ).  Target 2.4 Research within the field of LSS contributes to the identification of sustainable and resilient agricultural practices, including agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and sustainable intensification. These practices aid in minimizing environmental impacts, conserving biodiversity, and improving the resilience of food production systems (Pretty, et al., 2018 ).  Target 2.5 LSS contributes to the study and conservation of agrobiodiversity by comprehending the impact of various land uses and management practices on biodiversity. This understanding enables researchers to devise strategies for preserving and utilizing diverse genetic resources, crucial for resilient and adaptable agricultural systems (Khoury, et al., 2014 ).  Target 2.a By utilizing land use modeling and scenario analysis, decision-makers can determine regions with the greatest potential for agricultural development, guiding focused investments (Meinke, et al., 2009 ).  Target 2.c Through understanding the correlation between land use changes and food commodity markets, LSS (LSS) can anticipate potential food crises, enhance market transparency, and facilitate timely access to crucial market information, ultimately enhancing food security (Tilman, et al., 2011 ).  03 Good Health and Well Being Target 3.3 By studying the spatial distribution of infectious diseases and identifying environmental factors that influence their transmission, policymakers can implement focused interventions to control and prevent disease outbreaks in vulnerable regions (Lake, et al., 2012; McMichael, 2003 ).  Target 3.4 Land systems scientists can offer evidence-based recommendations for incorporating nature into urban landscapes to enhance mental health outcomes and promote physical activity, ultimately contributing to the reduction of non-communicable disease mortality (Van den Bosch and Sang, 2017 ).  Target 3.9 By identifying areas with significant pollution levels and assessing the health risks associated with exposure to hazardous chemicals (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals), policymakers can establish improved land use regulations and implement sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate pollution and safeguard public health (Ngowi, et al., 2007 ).  Target 3.d LSS can contribute to Target 3.d by analyzing land-use patterns and environmental changes that may increase health risks. For example, the expansion of urban areas into flood-prone zones or the encroachment of agricultural activities into wildlife habitats can potentially lead to zoonotic disease outbreaks. Understanding these risks enables countries to enhance their early warning systems and develop strategies for risk reduction and preparedness (Jones et al., 2013; Seto et al., 2012a ).  06 Clean Water and Sanitation Target 6.3 Scientists and policymakers can implement more effective wastewater treatment systems and develop guidelines for sustainable land use practices near water bodies by studying the relationships between land management practices, such as agriculture and urban development, and water quality (Baker, 2006 ).  Target 6.4 Decision-makers can implement measures to alleviate water scarcity and ensure its equitable distribution by analyzing the relationship between land use patterns and water availability (Falkenmark and Rockström, 2006 ).  Target 6.6 Researchers can identify areas in need of conservation, restoration, or sustainable management to preserve ecosystem services related to water resources by understanding the vital role of land in maintaining healthy water-related ecosystems, such as wetlands, watersheds, and river systems (Zedler and Kercher, 2005 ).  Target 6.a LSS can aid in assessing the capacity and capability of different countries to effectively manage their water and sanitation resources. It helps build the necessary expertise and skills to implement sustainable practices and policies through collaborative research and knowledge exchange. This fosters international cooperation in achieving SDG 6 targets and facilitates the transfer of best practices to developing nations (Carr and Neary, 2008 ).  11 Sustainable Cities and Communities Target 11.1 LSS can contribute to this target by researching urban land use patterns, identifying suitable locations for affordable housing developments, and understanding the spatial distribution of slums. Such research provides valuable insights to policymakers and urban planners for effective housing and infrastructure development (Rosa, 2017 ).  Target 11.3 Understanding the dynamics of urban areas, cities can create policies that support equitable access to housing, infrastructure, and services, and promote resilience against future challenges such as climate change and population growth (Alberti, 2005 ).  Target 11.7 Researchers can pinpoint locations for parks, recreational areas, and other public spaces that cater to the needs of vulnerable groups using geospatial analysis (Pauleit, et al., 2011 ).  Target 11.b LSS can inform strategies for resource-efficient urbanization, climate change adaptation, and disaster risk reduction through the analysis of land-use patterns (Seto, et al., 2014 ).  13 Climate Action Target 13.1 Understanding the vulnerabilities of different landscapes and ecosystems to climate-related hazards, such as extreme weather events, wildfires, and floods, LSS informs strategies for building resilience and enhancing adaptive capacity in vulnerable areas (Parmesan, et al., 2022 ).  Target 13.2 LSS informs policymakers about the potential impacts of different land use policies and helps identify climate-friendly approaches that can be incorporated into national planning processes by analyzing the interactions between land use changes, climate change, and mitigation strategies (Yamanoshita, 2019 ).  Target 13.3 LSS fosters awareness and understanding of climate change impacts on land systems and helps design early warning systems for climate-related risks and disasters by providing training programs and resources for professionals and policymakers (Kates, et al., 2012 ).  Target 13.a LSS can facilitate the assessment of carbon stocks and emissions in different land-use types, supporting mechanisms like REDD+ that enable financial support for developing countries in their climate efforts (Griscom, et al., 2017 ).  Target 13.b LSS empowers communities, including vulnerable groups, with information and tools to make informed decisions about sustainable land use practices by incorporating local knowledge and engaging with them in the development of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies (Porter, et al., 2014 ).  14 Life Below Water Target 14.2 Researchers employ land systems modeling and remote sensing techniques to evaluate land-use changes, as well as the impact of sediment and nutrient runoff on coastal ecosystems (Nkonya, et al., 2016 ).  Target 14.5 Through the analysis of land use patterns and their ecological consequences, LSS can aid in the identification and designation of critical marine protected areas (Bennett, et al., 2016 ).  Target 14.a LSS strengthens the capacity to address marine-related challenges through interdisciplinary research in fields such as ecology, geography, and environmental science (Turner, et al., 2004 ).  Target 14.b Through the study of land-sea linkages, scientists and policymakers can implement effective measures to support sustainable fisheries management (Cinner, et al., 2016 ).  15 Life on Land Target 15.1 LSS utilizes remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and modeling techniques to assess biodiversity patterns and potential threats (Díaz, et al., 2019 ).  Target 15.2 LSS assists in monitoring the extent of deforestation and forest degradation, identifying the drivers behind these changes, and evaluating the impact of conservation and restoration measures (Lamb, et al., 2005 ).  Target 15.3 LSS aids in monitoring and assessing land degradation processes and soil health, enabling targeted interventions to restore degraded land (Nkonya, et al., 2016 ).  Target 15.5 LSS assists in mitigating ecosystem fragmentation through the mapping of landscape connectivity, identification of ecological corridors, and analysis of the impacts of infrastructure development on biodiversity and habitats (Tischendorf, et al., 2003 ).  Target 15.9 LSS supports the integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values into planning processes through the provision of data on ecosystem services, mapping priority areas for conservation, and conducting spatial assessments to identify potential trade-offs between development and conservation goals (Nelson, et al., 2009 ).  Target 15.a LSS contributes to knowledge mobilization and sharing through research, the generation of evidence-based recommendations, and the dissemination of findings to policymakers, practitioners, and the public via academic publications, reports, and online platforms (Václavík, et al., 2013 ).

However, there are still key advancements needed to support land system science in meeting the challenges ahead and further contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. Therefore, this paper uses scientometrics to evaluate the development process of land system science and explore the challenges and weaknesses it faces. Our findings indicate that: (1) The number and citation frequency of land system science publications have been increasing in recent years; (2) Fields like "land use change", "systematic review", "machine learning", "agricultural land", and "environmental science" have gradually become research hotspots with the development and progress of land system science; (3) Land system science has gradually formed as an interdisciplinary subject, with increasing attention on human and environmental issues; (4) Contributions to land system science research mainly come from the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Germany, while China and Germany still need to strengthen their cooperation with other countries. Meanwhile, the imbalance in participation between the Global North and the Global South remains a significant challenge for global sustainable development; (5) The contribution of land systems science to the SDGs is primarily concentrated within the environment and society groups, including Climate Action (SDG 13), Life on Land (SDG 15), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Zero Hunger (SDG 02), as well as Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 06). This review highlights the significant potential of land system science in achieving SDGs and identifies key challenges that need to be addressed to advance the field.

Given that land use serves as a crucial intermediary between humans and the environment, addressing land-related issues is essential for significant progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the future (Li, et al., 2020; McSweeney and Coomes, 2020 ). Land is a central concern in three global challenges proposed by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), including land degradation, climate change, and biodiversity loss (UNCCD, 2022 ). International agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Paris Climate Agreement, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, recognize the essential role of sustainable land use and management in promoting sustainable development (Meyfroidt, et al., 2022 ). However, land system science (LSS) still faces significant challenges (Rounsevell, et al., 2012 ). Therefore, there is a need for substantial advancements in LSS to promote sustainable development. Land, as one of the most important resources on Earth, serves as the foundation for various ecosystems, natural resources, and human activities (Verburg, et al., 2015 ). It plays a critical role in sustaining life, providing food, shelter, and resources for human development (Xie et al., 2020a ). However, rapid population growth, technological innovation, urbanization, and intensification of agriculture have placed tremendous pressure on land systems worldwide, resulting in significant environmental and social impacts (Creutzig, 2017; Cumming, et al., 2014; Liu and Tian, 2010; Meyfroidt, et al., 2022 ). These land-related challenges include land degradation, urbanization and land use change, land tenure and rights, and land and climate change (Long, et al., 2021 ). The study of land use and land cover (LULC) changes represents a pivotal stage in the evolution of LSS (Verburg, et al., 2019 ). During this phase, scientists concentrate on the monitoring and modeling of land cover changes and their ecological consequences, conducting comprehensive assessments of changes in land function (Lambin, 1999; Verburg, et al., 2009 ). Mapping LULC is essential for gaining a complete understanding of the transformation of the Earth's surface driven by human activities, with the overarching aim of supporting sustainable development and effective environmental management (Lambin and Meyfroidt, 2011 ). Research into LULC encompasses various tasks, including land classification and monitoring, analysis of LULC changes, land resource assessment, land use planning and management, disaster risk assessment, and ecosystem monitoring. LUCC studies are conducted at various scales, providing a scientific foundation for decision-making, ecological preservation, and resource management to ensure the sustainable utilization and ecological equilibrium of land resources (Cao, et al., 2021; Yu, et al., 2022 ). Gradually, an integrated approach allows for the consideration of land changes as integral components of global environmental changes. There is increasing emphasis on understanding the feedback loops between driving factors and impacts, encompassing knowledge from social, economic, geographic, and other related scientific disciplines (Rindfuss, et al., 2004; Turner, et al., 2007 ). This evolution led to the prominence of the concept of land systems. Land systems represent an integrated approach to understanding the complex and dynamic interactions between human activities and the natural environment (Li, et al., 2020; Verburg, et al., 2013 ). These systems are shaped by a range of interconnected and multifaceted processes, such as population growth, urbanization, agricultural expansion, industrialization, infrastructure development, and natural resource exploitation (Long, et al., 2021 ). These processes often lead to changes in land use, which represents a significant form of human influence on the environment (Zhou, et al., 2020 ). Land systems focus on human-environment interactions, including the mechanisms, processes, adaptation, scale effects, and telecouplings of land use/cover change (Li, et al., 2020 ). The interaction between human activities and global environmental change gives rise to land systems on a global scale (Rounsevell, et al., 2012 ). The concept of land systems contributes to advancing land research and promoting sustainable land management (Xie et al., 2020b) . LSS formerly known as Land Change Science, has emerged as an interdisciplinary field (Turner, et al., 2007 ). Its evolution can be traced through various communities such as Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystem (1992–2003), Land Use Land Cover Change (1994–2005), Global Land Project, and Future Earth (Li, et al., 2020; GLP, 2016 ). The objective of LSS is to comprehensively understand the intricate interactions between human and natural systems across various scales (Lambin and Meyfroidt, 2011 ). Due to the complexity of land systems, LSS integrates multiple disciplines including geography, ecology, sociology, economics, and remote sensing. Through the study of land system transitions, LSS contributes to understanding the underlying processes, feedback mechanisms, and trade-offs associated with land systems, encompassing the physical environment, human activities, and societal processes (Verburg, et al., 2015 ). The evolution of LSS is spurred by global environmental changes and the pursuit of sustainable development goals (Roy Chowdhury and Turner, 2019; Turner, et al., 2007 ). Its primary goals include elucidating the intricate relationship between humans and the environment, advancing sustainable land use practices, and facilitating the more effective integration of scientific insights into land planning and policymaking (Verburg, et al., 2015 ). Over the years, LSS has shifted its focus from studying patterns, processes, and influencing factors of land use/land cover change to developing a systematic understanding of human-land interaction (Li, et al., 2020 ). The concept of coupled human and natural systems highlights the significance of understanding social, economic, and political factors that influence land use decisions and their impacts on ecosystem services. While LSS offers a critical pathway for promoting sustainable land management, it still faces numerous challenges. Improving data availability and quality, as well as developing standardized protocols and frameworks, are crucial for advancing the field of LSS (Verburg, et al., 2015 ). Reliable and consistent data at different spatial and temporal scales are challenging to obtain, limiting the analysis of land use and land cover dynamics. The spatial and temporal scale mismatch of available data also hinders the development of land system research. Additionally, modeling land systems entails dealing with inherent uncertainties arising from the complexity of social-ecological systems and the limitations of available data. Therefore, improved modeling techniques and methodologies that account for uncertainty are vital for advancing LSS (Li, et al., 2020 ). Clarifying land control and ownership issues, as well as integrating governance and policies, are also critical challenges for sustainable land development (McSweeney and Coomes, 2020; Reed, et al., 2013 ). To support sustainable land use and management, further progress is needed in land system science. This paper employs scientometrics platforms to review the research status and potential future trends of LSS. We analyze the research fields, journals, research bases, keywords, and collaborative relationships in this field. The findings of this review offer insights into the subject characteristics of LSS and the existing challenges and deficiencies. Moreover, the paper highlights the contributions of LSS to sustainable development and the challenges faced by LSS. These research results will contribute to the advancement of LSS and the promotion of sustainable development.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data collection and processing This review utilizes bibliometrics and scientometrics to analyze the disciplinary evolution of LSS based on existing literature. LSS articles were obtained from the core collection of Web of Science (https://www.webofscience.com/ , accessed on March 29, 2024), a prominent global academic database, including the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), with data until December 31, 2023. Relevant articles were screened from the core collection using the criteria "Topic = Land System Science or Land Change Science, Document Types = Articles or Review Articles; Publication Years until 2023." In total, 6789 articles related to LSS were obtained (see Supplementary Material ), serving as the basis for the bibliometric and scientometric analysis conducted in this study. Although LULC is an important stage in the development of land system science, due to the broad scope of LULC research, we were unable to include it in our study.  2.2 Scientometric analysis Bibliometric analysis software, including CiteSpace (Chen, et al., 2010 ), OVSviewer (Perianes-Rodriguez, et al., 2016 ), and BIBLIOMETRIC (https://bibliometric.com/ ), was employed to carry out scientometric analysis of LSS studies. These platforms enable the analysis of document co-citations, keyword co-occurrences, and visualization of cooperative networks, facilitating the exploration of the knowledge base, structural frameworks, and research frontiers within the field of LSS. As shown in  Fig. 1 , we visualize the research status and potential future trends of LSS. These analyses serve as a basis for innovative methods to achieve suitable land use and improve the sustainable land system in LSS.   3 Results 3.1 Trend of research on land system science 3.1.1 Research outputs Since 1986, a total of 6787 publications on LSS have been published (Table S1 ).  Fig. 2  illustrates the exponential growth of LSS publications in recent years. The number of publications has been steadily increasing, reaching its highest peak in recent years. In 2023, there were517 LSS publications (after removing duplicate publications across countries). The United States leads in terms of the total number of LSS publications, with 2551 publications, surpassing all other countries by a large margin. Other countries with significant numbers of LSS publications include China (1046), the United Kingdom (1014), Germany (776), Australia (538), Canada (498), Netherlands (490), France (469), Italy (330), and Spain (294). China showed the most significant growth trend, with the number of LSS publications reaching 145 in 2023, second only to the United States and considerably higher than other countries. From 1986–2023, the annual number of citations for LSS publications has exhibited exponential growth, reaching 40,818 in 2022 (Fig. 2 ).  3.1.2 Analysis of the distribution of articles among Journals We collected a total of 4839 articles on LSS from the Web of Science (WoS), which were published in 1428 journals (Table S2 ).  Table 1  reveals that most journals have a small number of published LSS articles, typically less than 10. More than half of the journals (757) have only published one article on LSS, while approximately 535 journals have published between 2 and 10 articles. Only 15 journals have published more than 50 LSS articles: Sustainability (157), Land Use Policy (141), Agriculture Ecosystems Environment (116), Land (107), Remote Sensing (105), Landscape and Urban Planning (100), Ecology and Society (99), Science of The Total Environment (93), Remote Sensing of Environment (83), Journal of environmental management (76), Landscape Ecology (65), Forest Ecology and Management (61), Biological Conservation (59), Environmental Science Policy (59), and Environmental Research Letters (56). These LSS articles are disseminated through internationally influential journals focused on Environmental Sciences, Ecology, Geosciences Multidisciplinary, Environmental Studies, and Water Resources, among others. The citation count is a significant criterion for measuring the quality of articles. Thus, this paper employs the total number of citations for articles published in the LSS journal to evaluate the journals' respective contributions to LSS.  Table 2  presents these findings, revealing that the Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences of The United States of America (670), Remote Sensing of Environment (406), Global Environmental Change-Human and Policy Dimensions (398), Ecology and Society (371), Land Use Policy (365), Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment (345), Landscape Ecology (302), Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability (291), Science (202), and Landscape and Urban Planning (159) have the highest total citations. These figures indicate that these journals have made significant contributions to the field of land system science. When considering the average number of citations per article within a journal, Science (22.44), Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences of The United States of America (18.11) Global Environmental Change-Human and Policy Dimensions (11.06), and Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability (7.46) come out on top. These results suggest that the LSS articles published in these journals are of high quality. However, it is important to note that the number of published LSS articles is also a crucial factor in assessing the influence of a journal. Moreover, the average number of citations is closely related to the journal's impact factor.  Fig. 3  displays a map illustrating a citation network of journals. Each node in the network represents a journal, with the size of the node indicating its importance within the network (i.e., larger nodes represent higher importance). Furthermore, the color of each node signifies the average time it takes for the journal to publish LSS articles, with blue indicating earlier publication times and yellow indicating more recent publication times. Noteworthy journals that play a significant role in connecting others include Sustainability, Land Use Policy, Remote Sensing, and Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment. Of particular importance in recent years, because of the huge number of publications, the journals Remote Sensing and Sustainability have gradually assumed crucial roles in the field of LSS.   3.2 Structure of the body of knowledge on land system science 3.2.1 Knowledge base: document co-citation analysis We utilized CiteSpace, a literature analysis software, to conduct a co-citation analysis and clustering of the cited literature. This allowed us to identify common research fields and analyze the knowledge base of LSS. By analyzing the literature clusters, we identified 8 significant research areas within LSS: ecosystem services, remote sensing, land use change, carbon sequestration, water quality, citizen science, forest management, biomass, and sediment sources. Land plays a crucial role as the foundation of Earth's ecosystems and serves as the primary provider of ecosystem services. Changes in land use have a significant impact on the provision of ecosystem services (Fu, et al., 2015; Hasan, et al., 2020 ). Consequently, LSS has a close relationship with ecosystem services and its continued development will significantly contribute to ecosystem service research. Additionally, carbon sequestration, water quality, citizen science, forest management, biomass, and sediment source are crucial research areas within LSS as they have a significant impact on the overall land system. Due to advancements in remote sensing technology, the growing number of earth observation satellites, increasing free access to remote sensing data, and continuous improvements in data quality and information, satellite data has emerged as a vital foundation for studying LSS.  Table 3  presents the key references in LSS papers, identified using the burst detection tool in CiteSpace software. These papers have made outstanding contributions to LSS and can reflect the knowledge base of LSS to a certain extent (Kleinberg, 2002 ). The strength indicates the importance of the article, while the start and end time of the burst represent the duration of its influence. The development of LSS has always placed a strong emphasis on land use, as shown in Table 3 . On one hand, land use significantly impacts the food supply and the protection of forest ecosystems (Lambin and Meyfroidt, 2011; Foley, et al., 2005 ). On the other hand, changes in land use have a pronounced effect on the global environment (Turner, et al., 2007 ). Consequently, achieving optimal land use zoning and sustainable land uses represents a substantial challenge in the quest for sustainable development (Verburg, et al., 2015 ). In addition, LSS has progressively shifted its focus toward ecosystem services. Land plays a critical role as a provider of essential ecosystem services that support human well-being (Watson, et al., 2019; Wu, 2013 ). When considering land issues systematically, ecosystem services emerge as vital characteristics of the land. The field of LSS aims to reconcile the conflict between land and the environment, therefore attracting growing attention to the complex interplay between humans and the environment (Rockström, et al., 2009 ). The achievement of sustainable development has thus emerged as a central issue in LSS (Liu, et al., 2013; Ostrom, 2009; Verburg, et al., 2015 ). An accurate global map serves as a fundamental basis for research in LSS. For instance, the high-resolution global forest cover change map developed by Hansen, et al. (2013)  constitutes a valuable data source for further research in this field. Finally, LSS has evolved into an interdisciplinary subject that focuses on the dynamics of human and environmental systems, employing systems theory to tackle environmental and social problems.  3.2.2 Main research areas: keywords co-occurrence analysis The keywords in an article can signify the principal areas of research explored in the article, and through keyword co-occurrence analysis, significant research directions within the research field can be determined (Su and Lee, 2010 ). This review utilizes CiteSpace to perform keyword co-occurrence analysis on LSS publications to gain insights into specific research topics in LSS. Table S3  presents the keywords extracted using CiteSpace. These keywords depict the research focus in various periods within the LSS field. As depicted in  Fig. 4 , the year corresponding to each keyword indicates when that keyword first appeared in the analyzed publications, and the node size reflects the frequency of keyword occurrences. The keywords with the highest frequency are climate change, land use change, ecosystem services, land use, land cover, sustainable development, and remote sensing, with respective occurrence frequencies of 845, 688, 370, 276, 275, 231, and 204. Climate change serves as a critical factor that impacts land, leading to persistent droughts or altering patterns (Abel, et al., 2021 ). Land use and ecosystem services have consistently remained central issues in LSS research, with remote sensing serving as a fundamental tool in land research. Land sustainability is the foundation of sustainable development, providing crucial support for achieving long-term economic, social, and environmental Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In terms of burstiness, several topics have shown higher burst strength in LSS research. These include land use change (23.67), systematic review (17.75), machine learning (17.16), environmental science (15.65), agricultural land (15.57), geographic information systems (GIS) (14.55), agricultural sciences (12.28), artificial intelligence (12.08), and space sciences (11.78) (please refer to Table S3  for details). These topics represent the focal areas of research in LSS for a specific period, with the start and end times of bursts indicating the duration of these areas of interest. For instance, the early period of LSS research (before 2005) emphasized the application of water quality, soil erosion, and GIS technology. However, as knowledge and technology advanced, the focus of LSS research gradually shifted toward ecosystem services, social-ecological systems, environmental science, and machine learning. This evolution demonstrates that LSS now not only investigates land characteristics like water quality, soil erosion, and soil quality, but also acknowledges the importance of human-land interaction and its impact on the ecological environment, encompassing aspects such as ecosystem services, social-ecological systems, environmental science, and global change. Fig. 4  shows that keywords like climate change, remote sensing, water quality, food security, and land degradation emerged earlier, while keywords like social-ecological systems, global change, citizen science, and machine learning surfaced later. Overall, as an interdisciplinary field, LSS progressively comprehensively examines land-related issues, employing advanced tools.  3.2.3 Outstanding contributions: co-authorship analysis We utilized CiteSpace to investigate the cooperation network among institutions and countries in the field of LSS literature. Each node in the network is assigned a Centrality value, which signifies the likelihood of any shortest path in the network passing through that particular node, representing its significance in the network (Brandes, 2001 ).  Table 4  presents the countries with the highest respective centrality values for LSS publications. Notably, land system science research is prevalent, led by the Global North. France takes the top spot with a value of 0.2, indicating its significant role in the cooperation network. The United Kingdom and Spain are also essential countries in the LSS cooperation network, with a centrality of 0.1 and 0.09 respectively. Additionally, countries such as the Netherlands (0.07), Belgium (0.07), Denmark (0.07), Switzerland (0.07), Australia (0.07), and Canada (0.07) exhibit high Centrality values, playing a critical role in establishing connections for LSS research with other nations. It is worth noting that while China, Germany, and Italy have a substantial number of LSS publications, their influence in the cooperation network is relatively weak (Fig. 4 ). Therefore, it is imperative for these countries to gradually strengthen their collaborations and connections with other nations. In the research of LSS, there is a significant lack of participation from scientists in the Global South. In Table 4 , among the top 20 countries with the highest centrality, only three are from the Global South: South Africa, India, and Kenya, while the rest are from the Global North. In the publications we collected on LSS, the participation frequency of scientists from the Global North is 9279, whereas that from the Global South is 2745, indicating a substantial gap in participation. As shown in  Table 5 , among the Global North countries, the United States has the highest participation rate with 2551 counts, almost equaling the total participation count of all Global South countries combined. Among the Global South countries, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa have higher participation frequencies, with frequencies of 1046, 202, 189, and 178 respectively, while participation frequencies from other Global South countries are relatively low. China alone accounts for 38.10 % of the total participation frequency, while the top four countries collectively contribute 58.83 % of the total participation. According to the Sustainable Development Report, countries with relatively ideal progress in achieving SDGs are predominantly from the Global North, which aligns closely with the research participation frequencies. However, due to the large volume of publications, it lacks strong centrality within the collaboration network of institutions and authors. Therefore, we discussed the contributions made by institutions and authors in the field of LSS. We employed BIBLIOMETRIC to examine the citations of an institution's LSS publications. This scientific metric tool excludes articles that do not have any citation relationship in LSS publications and only considers the mutual citations between LSS publications. This approach allows for a more effective reflection of an article's contribution to the field of LSS. Table S4  reveals significant variations in the number of publications and citations among different institutions. Clark University leads with the highest number of total citations (1314) and citations of first-author articles (494) in LSS research. This suggests that Clark University plays a substantial role in the advancement of LSS. Other institutions with a notable number of cited LSS articles include Chinese Academy of Sciences (1160), Arizona State University (1107), University of Copenhagen (766), NASA (733), University of Bern (626), Vrije University Amsterdam (625), University of Maryland (618), Humboldt–Universität zu Berlin (599), and McGill University (554). Clark University (508), and Wageningen University (359). To gauge an institution's contribution to LSS research, it is better to consider the number of citations of the first author's article. Institutions with the most cited LSS first-author articles are Arizona State University (346), Chinese Academy of Sciences (228), Catholic University of Louvain (222), Wageningen University (149), Vrije University Amsterdam (114), University of Bern (108), University of Maryland (101), Ohio State University (100), and Yale University (100). However, some institutions with high citation counts have low average citations, indicating that their LSS articles are not receiving widespread attention. For instance, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has an average citation of 2.11 per article and an average citation of 1.08 per first-author article, while NASA has an average citation of 3.08 per article and an average citation of 1.89 per first-author article. Institutions such as Clark University and the Catholic University of Louvain excel in producing a greater number of publications and achieving higher citation rates, underscoring the significance of their LSS publications in the field's development.   3.3 Land system science contributions to sustainable development Sustainability is commonly defined as the pursuit of intra-generational and inter-generational equity across three fundamental dimensions: environmental, social, and economic (Wu, 2013 ). This means striving for a balance where the needs of the present generation are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable land use is fundamental to achieving sustainable development and can aid in adapting to climate change, biodiversity conservation, food security, poverty alleviation, and sustainable energy (Meyfroidt, et al., 2022; Sachs, et al., 2019; Yu, et al., 2023 ). Sustainable land use is a comprehensive concept that underscores the judicious utilization and management of land resources to meet the needs of both present and future generations while simultaneously safeguarding the environment and preserving ecological equilibrium (Foley, et al., 2005 ). It also encompasses three critical dimensions: environmental social, and economic sustainability, with the overarching aim of ensuring the long-term viability of land resources (Wu, 2013 ). Achieving sustainable land use necessitates an enhanced comprehension of land systems and normative foundations. Meyfroidt, et al. (2022)  have identified ten fundamental facts that serve as core principles to enhance our understanding of land systems, thereby advancing the sustainability of land use. These facts debunk long-standing misconceptions about land use, elucidate the inherent properties of land, and describe empirical truths currently. Meyfroidt, et al. (2022)  believe that land use predominantly serves human interests, and while constructing a mutually beneficial land use model is challenging due to conflicts arising from diverse collective interests, it is possible to create win-win scenarios by taking into account social and environmental equity considerations. The work of Meyfroidt, et al. (2022)  provides valuable insights and a policy framework for sustainable land development, which aligns with the overarching goals of LSS. This research can serve as a valuable reference point for further exploration and comprehension of the principles and practices associated with sustainable land development. From the current perspective, LSS has made significant contributions to advancing sustainable development goals. LSS research and methodologies have played a crucial role in promoting sustainable land use, environmental conservation, and effective resource management, all of which are integral components of broader sustainable development efforts. Through its focus on understanding land systems, LSS has provided valuable insights and tools to help address the complex challenges associated with sustainability, making a positive impact on achieving sustainable development goals. LSS aids in achieving sustainable land system, further facilitating the realization of Sustainable Development Goals. As shown in  Fig. 5 b, sustainability efforts aim to ensure the responsible use of resources, the preservation of the environment, the promotion of social well-being, and the maintenance of economic viability over the long term. LSS needs to adapt to practice and policy driven by sustainability and continue to innovate in data utilization, modeling, synthesis methods, and long-term studies to address emergent issues and priority research themes in land systems. The priority themes include telecoupling, land-climate interactions, land use and conflict, land governance, tradeoffs on services and biodiversity, etc., which improve the understanding of the land system (GLP, 2016 ). Ultimately, LSS aims to realize sustainable use of land and propose a sustainable land system. LSS plays a vital role in addressing multiple SDGs by offering a comprehensive and integrated approach to examining the interactions between human societies and the environment (Cf, 2015; Verburg, et al., 2015 ). Through literature review, we identified the SDGs that LSS has the potential to promote. As shown in  Table 6 , the LSS literature provides significant support for the attainment of various sustainable development goals. The LSS articles have notably contributed to several SDGs, including Climate Action (SDG 13), Life on Land (SDG 15), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Zero Hunger (SDG 02), and Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 06), with article counts of 3147, 3028, 1346, 838, and 705, respectively. Nevertheless, its influence on other SDGs appears comparatively less significant. Following Vinuesa, et al. (2020)  classification of SDGs, we categorize the collected publications related to land system science into three groups: Economic, Social, and Environmental. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the contribution of LSS is primarily concentrated SDGs within the environmental and societal groups. In the publications we collected, there is a significant contribution to the environmental and societal groups, with 6488 and 3653 publications respectively, while the contribution to the economic group is minimal. Based on the above, we conduct a detailed analysis of the potential contribution of LSS to the SDGs, as Fig. 5 c and  Table 7  shown. LSS supports poverty eradication and sustainable livelihoods (SDG 1), optimized agriculture for hunger elimination (SDG 2), health analysis linked to land use (SDG 3), water resource impact assessments (SDG 6), urban planning for sustainable cities (SDG 11), climate action strategies (SDG 13), and ecosystem preservation (SDG 15). Certainly, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a comprehensive framework addressing global challenges across various domains. SDG 1, aiming to eliminate poverty, finds support through Land System Science (LSS) by analyzing spatial poverty distribution and identifying opportunities for sustainable livelihoods and equitable land access (Deininger, et al., 2012; Donges, et al., 2017; Manuschevich, et al., 2019 ). This approach aids policymakers in devising evidence-based strategies for poverty eradication. SDG 2, concerning hunger eradication and sustainable agriculture, benefits from LSS by understanding land use for optimized food production and promoting sustainable food systems through informed decision-making (Herrero, et al., 2013; Viana, et al., 2022 ). SDG 3, focusing on health and well-being, leverages LSS to analyze the impact of land use on health, including disease spread, disaster risk management, and healthier environments (Broeckx, et al., 2018; Myers, et al., 2013; Shanahan, et al., 2016 ). SDG 6, clean water and sanitation, uses LSS to comprehend land use impact on water resources, aiding in water preservation and sustainable usage (Dwarakish and Ganasri, 2015; Le Mouël, et al., 2018 ). SDG 11, sustainable cities and communities, benefits from LSS in urban planning, optimizing land use, and creating more efficient and environmentally friendly cities (Angel et al., 2011; Seto et al., 2012b ). SDG 13, climate action, utilizes LSS to understand land use's role in climate change, aiding in strategies for reducing deforestation and managing land for carbon storage (Houghton, 2003; Houghton, et al., 2012; Nepstad, et al., 2014 ). Lastly, SDG 15, life on land, aligns closely with LSS by examining terrestrial ecosystems, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable land use to monitor biodiversity, assess human impact, and guide conservation efforts (Foley, et al., 2005; Kremen, et al., 2008 ). LSS, across these various SDGs, provides a logical framework for understanding and managing land systems. It serves as a critical tool for decision-making, offering insights into poverty eradication, sustainable agriculture, health, water management, urban planning, climate action, and biodiversity conservation. By using data-driven approaches to understand land use and its impact, LSS supports informed policy formulation, aiding in achieving multiple SDGs.   4 Discussion Although significant progress has been made in recent decades in understanding land use change and land systems, the dynamic nature of land systems presents a wide array of challenges that necessitate thorough investigation and innovative approaches (Verburg, et al., 2015 ). However, several obstacles impede the advancement of this discipline, and overcoming them is crucial to ensuring effective land use practices. Hence, we identify and discuss the primary challenges that LSS faces and explore potential solutions to address these issues. By comprehending these challenges, researchers and policymakers can make well-informed decisions to promote sustainable land use and conservation endeavors. 4.1 Data availability and quality One of the major challenges encountered in LSS is the limited availability and reliability of data. Accurate analysis and modeling heavily rely on comprehensive and high-resolution data about land use, land cover, and land changes. However, the scarcity of data collection networks in certain regions, along with associated limitations and uncertainties, can impede the progress of research (Alexander, et al., 2017 ). The integration of multiple datasets, often originating from different sources, can introduce uncertainties and biases into land use assessments. To combat this challenge, potential solutions include enhancing data collection methods, establishing standardized protocols, and investing in remote sensing technologies (Verburg, et al., 2015 ).  4.2 Scale and spatial heterogeneity The study of land use and land cover change necessitates data and methods capable of capturing changes and interactions across multiple scales, ranging from local to regional and global levels. Addressing the challenges of upscaling and downscaling land-use models, while accounting for spatial variations, is crucial (Verburg, et al., 2009 ). Moreover, the process of scaling data up or down can lead to information loss and inaccuracies in analyses, highlighting the need for robust methodologies that account for scale-dependent investigations (Steffen, et al., 2011 ). Integrating data from diverse sources and resolutions while maintaining spatial consistency poses a significant challenge (Turner, et al., 2015 ).  4.3 Interdisciplinary integration The field of LSS demands the integration of various disciplines, including geography, ecology, sociology, economics, and remote sensing. However, achieving this integration proves challenging due to disparities in terminologies, methodologies, and research priorities among these disciplines (Dearing, et al., 2014; Lambin, et al., 2001 ). To obtain a comprehensive understanding of land systems, it is essential to overcome these barriers and establish shared frameworks that bridge these disciplinary gaps.  4.4 The complexity of land systems Land systems exhibit a high degree of complexity, as they encompass multifaceted interlinked processes and feedback loops (Li, et al., 2020 ). Understanding and accurately predicting the effects of human actions and climate changes on land use pose considerable challenges. To address these challenges, it is essential to integrate climate science with land systems research, which involves investigating the interactions between human and natural systems, as well as the relationships between land use and climate change (Pielke Sr, et al., 2011; Searchinger, et al., 2019 ). This integration necessitates grappling with multiple factors, including land-use decisions, demographic changes, and environmental factors, which can be daunting. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of these intricate relationships calls for the development of innovative methods and models that can effectively capture the interplay among social, economic, and biophysical factors. Nonetheless, developing such models that accurately encapsulate this complex integration while avoiding oversimplification or infeasible computational demands remains an ongoing challenge in the field of LSS (Magliocca, et al., 2015 ).  4.5 Policy and governance Effective land use necessitates well-crafted policies and governance frameworks that foster sustainable land use (Lambin and Geist, 2008; McSweeney and Coomes, 2020 ). Nevertheless, the execution of these policies frequently encounters hurdles stemming from conflicting interests, bureaucratic intricacies, and constrained resources (Verburg, et al., 2015 ). Unraveling the influence of these policies on land systems, enhancing the efficiency of data utilization, and incorporating scientific knowledge into decision-making processes remains a challenge for researchers studying land systems science (Fischer, et al., 2014; Lambin, et al., 2021; Sikor, et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, LSS research is predominantly led by Global North, with most Global South significantly lacking participation. This exacerbates regional research biases. Such an imbalance may result in solutions biased towards the perspectives of the Global North, hindering the development of sustainable land use policies at the local level and further intensifying the sustainable development challenges faced by Global South (Cash-Gibson, et al., 2015; Castro Torres and Alburez-Gutierrez, 2022 ). Given the relative underdevelopment of the Global South, future research efforts should prioritize regional equity. To address this, the United Nations and other international organizations could offer incentives such as financial support and technology transfer to promote active participation from the Global South in sustainable land use research (Blicharska, et al., 2017 ).   5 Conclusion This review utilizes CiteSpace, OVSviewer, and BIBLIOMETRIC software to conduct a scientometric analysis of LSS literature. The analysis encompasses the distribution of journals and research fields, keywords, cited documents, and the collaborative relationships among countries, institutions, and authors. The findings are as follows: (1) In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the number of LSS publications and their citations. (2) Prominent journals contributing to LSS like Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Remote Sensing of Environment, Global Environmental Change-Human and Policy Dimensions, Ecology and Society, and Land Use Policy, alongside other important research fields like Environmental Sciences, Ecology, Agriculture, Geology, and Engineering. (3) With the advancement and progress of LSS, keywords such as land use change, systematic review, machine learning, agricultural land, and environmental science have gained prominence in research. (4) LSS has gradually evolved into an interdisciplinary subject, with increasing attention on human and environmental issues. (5) Regarding collaborative networks, the contributions to LSS research primarily originate from the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Germany; however, China and Germany still require further collaboration with other countries. Nonetheless, the imbalance in participation between the Global North and the Global South remains a significant challenge for global sustainable development. (6) The contribution of land systems science to the SDGs is primarily concentrated within the environment and society groups, including Climate Action (SDG 13), Life on Land (SDG 15), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Zero Hunger (SDG 02), as well as Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 06). LSS provides an integrated approach to understanding the complexities of land dynamics and their implications for sustainable land management. By connecting disciplines and incorporating socio-ecological perspectives, this field offers valuable insights into the drivers of land change, ecosystem services, and land governance. However, the complexity of land systems requires integrated approaches that consider the social, economic, and ecological aspects. Consequently, LSS still faces significant challenges, such as data availability and quality, constructing complex models of land systems, and understanding the impact of policy and governance on land management. To tackle these emerging challenges, future research in LSS should prioritize climate change adaptation, socio-ecological systems, and improved data integration, while also fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and focusing on policy-relevant applications.
