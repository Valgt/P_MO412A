                  In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of harm to human health. In this research, a sustainable multi-objective mathematical model is presented, emphasizing the significance of both collective and individual living conditions that emerge amid pandemics. This model considers the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Food inflation, unemployment, domestic violence, and suicide rates are selected as indicators of life standards related to sustainability pillars and sustainable development goals. Domestic violence and suicide represent the social pillar, while food inflation represents the economic and social pillars. Lastly, unemployment is a measure of the economic, social, and environmental pillars. As indicated by the four indicators, the model maximizes the vaccination utility, minimizes the cost of vaccine supply, and minimizes the negative outcomes of preventive measures to control the outbreak of COVID-19. Cplex/GAMS software has been used to validate the model in small size and evaluate it in large size, respectively, using a random example and a case study of Iran. The results and the sensitivity analysis indicate that to achieve herd immunity in the shortest possible time and to minimize the pandemic-induced negative effects, all available capacities should be used for vaccination. Furthermore, in the case of not utilizing the existing capacities, the negative effects of preventive measures may increase by two times, making it impossible to achieve the desired results even over a longer period.

Handling Editor: Jian Zuo In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of harm to human health. In this research, a sustainable multi-objective mathematical model is presented, emphasizing the significance of both collective and individual living conditions that emerge amid pandemics. This model considers the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Food inflation, unemployment, domestic violence, and suicide rates are selected as indicators of life standards related to sustainability pillars and sustainable development goals. Domestic violence and suicide represent the social pillar, while food inflation represents the economic and social pillars. Lastly, unemployment is a measure of the economic, social, and environmental pillars. As indicated by the four indicators, the model maximizes the vaccination utility, minimizes the cost of vaccine supply, and minimizes the negative outcomes of preventive measures to control the outbreak of COVID-19. Cplex/GAMS software has been used to validate the model in small size and evaluate it in large size, respectively, using a random example and a case study of Iran. The results and the sensitivity analysis indicate that to achieve herd immunity in the shortest possible time and to minimize the pandemic-induced negative effects, all available capacities should be used for vaccination. Furthermore, in the case of not utilizing the existing capacities, the negative effects of preventive measures may increase by two times, making it impossible to achieve the desired results even over a longer period.

Such disasters lead to destructive effects on the society and economy and cause the death of many people (Butt, 2022 ; Jiao et al., 2023 ). Despite advances in science and medicine over the past decades, biological hazards, such as contagious diseases, continue to pose a threat to human life, and their significance has been highlighted in recent years. Several contagious diseases, such as plague cholera, which may become pandemics, can also adversely affect diverse aspects of a person's life (Margherita et al., 2021 ; Sun et al., 2022 ). Different types of Coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), have been causing epidemics in some parts of the world in recent decades (Liang, 2020 ). In particular, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which emerged in 2019 and quickly spread worldwide (Cihan, 2021 ; Kumar et al., 2022 ), has so far claimed 6,689,516 lives (at the time of writing) across the world (Worldometers, 2022 ). The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in loss of life and socioeconomic, medical, and educational losses (Josephson et al., 2021 ; Yin et al., 2023 ). The size and intensity of the incurred damage are rising because of the newly emerging nature of this virus, its widespread outbreak, the population's long infection duration with this disease, the lack of vaccines, etc. Thus, some control measures like lockdowns were adopted and implemented to manage the outbreak's impact on the current labor force, the medical care system, the closure of education institutes, and the decline of production works (Nicola et al., 2020 ). Therefore, in spite of reducing the prevalence, infection, and casualties associated with this pandemic, such control measures themselves have adverse effects in a variety of areas, such as psychological health and household welfare. In other words, control measures acted as a double-edged sword; on the one hand, they weakened the chain of disease transmission in society; on the other hand, they imposed some new negative effects on various aspects of human life. The socioeconomic and human damage that fall under the umbrella of the sustainability concept can all result from such control measures. Some effects of the control measures can be seen in the change in the rate of unemployment, suicide, domestic violence, and food inflation. For example, we can mention the increase in the unemployment rate worldwide from 1991 to 2021. As observed, the highest increase occurred between 2019 and 2020, which is a result of the control measures taken for COVID-19 (Fig. 1  ). Therefore, it would seem necessary and rational to devise a practical and efficient remedy for mitigating the prevalence and severity of this disease (Margherita et al., 2021 ). As medical experts suggested, using the COVID-19 vaccine in society can be an effective strategy to get rid of this crisis (Valizadeh et al., 2023 ; WHO, 2022 ), but coming up with a vaccine demands time and money for medical research, extensive tests in several phases (animal and human) and eventually, its mass production (Jahani et al., 2022 ). In light of the increasing number of infections and the sharp rise in the number of casualties on a daily basis, it is essential to have a vaccine on hand. However, despite spending the due time and paying the vaccine purchase costs, the global demand for vaccines leads to not having sufficient vaccines available for different countries at the right time, and thus, people face a shortage of vaccines (Chen, 2021 ). Under such circumstances, the countries relying on their local knowledge and equipped with the technology to manufacture and produce the vaccines have three options to follow. The first one is purchasing foreign vaccines, which requires spending the necessary time to register the purchase of the vaccines, the order, and import it. The second one is Manufacturing and producing the vaccines, which includes a period for researching and doing the medical tests and then mass production. In this case, the relevant country authorities can take action to manufacture and produce the vaccines as soon as possible, relying on local knowledge and technology. Ultimately, the third one is a combination of the two aforementioned options that consists of a combination of foreign purchase and domestic manufacture and production of the vaccine. In this option, according to the conditions prevailing in the country in terms of the casualties, the amount of the vaccine shortage, the cost of purchasing and manufacturing the vaccines, the time required to provide the vaccine, etc., and based on the discretion of the decision-makers in the health department, a combination of both options is employed. Selecting each of the above options should be done in such a way that gets accomplished within the shortest time period and brings about the least damage in various dimensions of life. The sooner vaccination is available to the public and is implemented, the lower the number of infected individuals and the casualties, and the lesser the negative effects caused by a prolonged period of the control measures. According to the epidemiologistsâ findings, if 80% of the population receives the vaccine, herd immunity against this disease should be achieved (Hosseini-Motlagh et al., 2023 ). In light of the above statements, finding a practical solution for choosing the best option within the shortest period of time is vital for preventing the spread of disease and minimizing the damage caused by the disease. In this paper, the main focus is on considering and giving importance to the collective and individual living conditions that arise during pandemics. In the case of the COVID-19 virus, we aim to highlight this type of significance through the strategic choice between vaccine supply and production as a solution to the challenges posed. The analysis indicates that this approach can lead to multidimensional benefits by effectively addressing criteria such as efficiency, cost, and specific sustainability indicators. The indicators that we intend to consider are the economic, social, and environmental indicators, which are also related to the concept of sustainability. Reportedly, no study has been performed considering the socioeconomic and environmental pillars of the sustainability approach, which proposes an appropriate optimal strategy for supplying the COVID-19 vaccine to minimize the control measures-induced damage for breaking the transmission chain of COVID-19 on diverse aspects of human life. Thus, in the present research regarding the sustainability approach, which includes socioeconomic and environmental considerations, a mathematical model is proposed. The model determines the best option based on the decision makersâ priority and preference out of the foreign vaccine purchase, domestic manufacturing and production, and a combination of them. This model minimizes the negative socioeconomic and environmental effects incurred by the control measures for reducing COVID-19 prevalence in various dimensions of human life. This way, supplying vaccines has accompanied the least human casualties and damage, and it can be justified in terms of utility, time, cost, and availability. If we want to express the specific aspects that indicate the pillars of sustainability, we should state as follows: the rate of domestic violence and suicide has been considered as the representatives of the social factors, and food inflation is related to economic and social pillars. Eventually, unemployment concerns economic, social, and environmental pillars. Additionally, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed upon by the UN member states in 2015 have been used to demonstrate how the control measures influence various aspects of human life. There is worth noting that only the short-term negative effects of COVID-19 control restrictions have been considered in this paper, whereas their long-term consequences following their annulment have not been considered. The main contributions and features of this research are as follows.â¢ Presenting a mathematical model emphasizing the significance of both collective and individual living conditions that emerge amid pandemics;  â¢ Analyzing the control measures-induced short-term negative effects for weakening the COVID-19 transmission chain on the socioeconomic and environmental dimensions of human life considering the SDGs and sustainability approach;  â¢ Considering the rate of domestic violence and suicide as the indications of social factors, the rate of food inflation as the representative of economic and social factors, and the unemployment rate representing economic, social, and environmental factors in the proposed model;  â¢ Selecting an optimal option between manufacturing domestic vaccines, purchasing foreign vaccines, or a combination of these two for supplying and distributing the vaccines within the shortest time period;  â¢ Presenting an effective solution in order to come up with herd immunity pursuing the goal of optimizing cost, utility, and negative outcomes of the control measures for reducing the prevalence of COVID-19;  â¢ Selecting Iran as a case study and solving the model to evaluate it in a large size, and analyzing the sensitivity of the model.    The rest of our work is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we provide a literature review of relevant studies. In Section 3 , the problem of study, along with our proposed mathematical model, is explained. In Section 4 , the solution method is presented. In Section 5 , numerical experimentations of the results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. Moreover, a case study is worked through, and computational results are provided. Then, the sensitivity of the proposed model is analyzed. In Section 6 , discussion and managerial insight are presented. Finally, concluding remarks and future research are given in Section 7 .  2 Related background and literature review The major works concerned with the COVID-19 consequences reviewed here are divided into three streams: (1) The recent studies for socioeconomic consequences along with a combined version, (2) The mental and human consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) Sustainability. 2.1 Socioeconomic consequences In a review paper published in 2020, Chu et al. (2020) , collected papers concerning the impact of lockdowns on people's lives, businesses, gender inequality, health care, and violence. They also pointed out the effects of these restrictions on the supply chain of goods, the tourism industry, and the production of agricultural products and provided some recommended strategies to reduce the negative social consequences of COVID-19 lockdowns. In another study, Li and Mutchler (2020) , surveyed the economic security of the elderly affected by the economic recession. Based on their estimation, the societies with high costs are disproportionately influenced by the pandemic and exposed to higher rates of infection. In addition, many working-aged people may lose their jobs in the short term, and this may be more common in areas where COVID-19 is more prevalent. Wei et al. (2021) , presented an article, and through their analyses, they concluded that the coronavirus has had its impact on the more vulnerable segments of society, including women's welfare, unemployment, and poverty. In fact, the effects of this pandemic are observable across all aspects of social well-being and require precise actions to combat it. Qian and Fan (2020) , in their research, surveyed the effects of COVID-19 on the individual-level economy and how people's income is affected by this pandemic. This study revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic not only exacerbates the existing social inequalities but also creates new forms of inequalities. Their study in China showed that people with higher education and higher family incomes are less exposed to this economic shock. To reduce social inequality, they recommended more public policies focusing on vulnerable and marginalized people. Ibn-Mohammed et al. (2021) , evaluated the positive and negative effects of COVID-19 on the global economy, the environment, and the tourism industry. Based on the experience of the 4-month global lockdown period, remote health care and medicine and telecommuting are no longer considered impractical. Abbasi et al. (2023a) , have introduced a multi-objective model for sustainable supply chain, which minimizes the negative social impacts related to lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mofijur et al. (2021) , conducted a comprehensive study on the impact exerted by the COVID-19 outbreak on the energy, ecological, environmental, social, and economic areas and reviewed the global preventive measures taken to lower the transmission of COVID-19. They pointed out, on the one hand, the positive effects of the lockdown on significantly reducing environmental pollution, and on the other hand, the increase of unemployment and poverty as the negative effects of the lockdown. As a major factor in controlling this disease, they mentioned vaccine production and injection. Pradhan et al. (2021) , studied the effects of COVID-19 on the SDGs and created a reverse trend in achieving these goals and discovered that SDGs 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 were more affected by the surveys conducted in five steps. They introduced five main inhibiting factors as follows: âlockdowns, underemployment and unemployment, closure of institutions and facilities, diluted focus and funds, and the anticipated reduction in support from development partners.â This results in the interruption or reduction of support for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. They determined the impact of all these five factors on people's lives and SDGs by conducting a case study in Nepal. Besides, as they assumed, the pandemic also brings about transformative opportunities that can be seen in the medium and long term. In a review paper, Ranjbari et al. (2021) , examined the papers on the pillars of sustainability during COVID-19 and presented five areas of research for the development of SDGs, which are as follows.â(1) Sustainability action plan considering COVID-19 implications,  (2) Making the most of sustainability transition opportunities in the wake of COVID-19,  (3) Innovative solutions for economic resilience towards sustainability of post-COVID-19,  (4) In-depth analysis of the COVID-19 long-term effects on social sustainability,  (5) Expanding quantitative research to harmonize the COVID-19-related sustainability research.â    Newbold et al. (2020) , studied the social distancing measures as a disease control factor in the absence of treatment and medicine and presented a relationship between social distancing and its positive effects on disease control and the negative effects on the economy and used this model for their case study in the USA. It is important to note that they focused on the intensity and timing of social distancing and considered the lives saved and the loss of income as the positive and negative outcomes. They also mentioned mask-wearing, testing, and lockdown as effective factors in physical social distancing and disease control.  2.2 Mental/human consequences In a research investigating the effect of COVID-19 on suicide, Sher (2020) , stated that COVID-19 survivors may be more exposed to the risk of suicide. This suicide rate can increase during the pandemic or following it, and these effects can last for a long time. Several factors have been mentioned as the factors influencing suicide, including economic factors and social isolation. The economic factor is a powerful and effective one on mental health because the increase in the unemployment rate and the economic decline increases depression, drug and alcohol abuse, and finally, suicide. According to this paper, stress, fear, and feelings of loneliness should be mitigated in order to reduce this suicide rate, and traditional campaigns and social media should be formed to promote mental health and reduce distress. Bhat et al. (2020) , in their study in Kashmir, measured the effects of COVID-19 on the stress and anxiety levels and psyche of individuals under economic downfall conditions that affected social life. According to their results, the majority of the respondents (67.5%) assume that the continuation of the lockdown can affect people's mental health because it causes income shrinkage or job loss. Nundy et al. (2021) , discussed the impacts of lockdown on job loss, financial insecurity, and economic recession. They also demonstrated that staying at home for 24Â h has had a negative psychological effect on individuals and has led to an increase in domestic violence and self-harm. Pedruzo et al. (2023) , based on data collected from two major cities in China, Wuhan and Shanghai, which experienced lockdowns during the years 2020 and 2022, found that the main factor related to an increase in domestic violence and depression is not induced by the spreading of COVID-19, but by the execution of lockdown. Colella et al. (2023) , utilized a fixed population of Twitter users located in France to assess the psychological health effects of repeated quarantine orders. To do this, they extracted a mental health index from their population, which measured the frequency of words related to anger, anxiety, and sadness. The relevant index did not show statistically significant psychological health effects during the first quarantine, whereas the second quarantine resulted in a pronounced and sustained increase in all three emotional states. The findings also indicate more severe psychological distress among women and younger users during the second quarantine. Ayuso-Mateos et al. (2023) , have presented a paper to assess whether there is a change in the prevalence of depression and suicidal thoughts in Spain. Following strict quarantine measures due to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, they demonstrated a significant change in the prevalence of depression, increasing from 3.06% to 12%.  2.3 Sustainability Abbasi et al. (2023b) , presented a multi-objective vaccine supply chain model in which they addressed the environmental aspect. In fact, their environmental discussion relates to vaccine production and storage. Their model aims to strike a balance between environmental preservation and economic growth during the COVID-19 era. Abbasi et al. (2022) , have also presented a framework for assessing the sustainability performance of the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic, which consists of 3 pillars and 23 indicators. Amani Bani et al. (2022) , presented a sustainable reverse supply chain in which they focused on minimizing COVID-19 vaccine waste. Their aim was to minimize costs and carbon dioxide emissions, and they addressed the uncertainty using robust optimization techniques. Chowdhury et al. (2022) , formulated a sustainable vaccine supply chain network tailored to the characteristics of a developing nation. They tackled the three dimensions of sustainability by constructing objective functions based on the total cost, total emissions, and total negative employment value. Cao et al. (2023) , presented a sustainable model in the field of medical waste transportation for COVID-19. They addressed the minimization of environmental waste and maximization of economic profits. Cao et al. (2022) , introduced a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at addressing the integrated issue of locating and transporting various types of COVID-19 medical waste across multiple time periods. Their objective was to optimize overall economic gains, minimize carbon emissions, and reduce potential social risks. Chowdhury et al. (2021) , critically assessed the positive and negative external effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on environmental components, including air, water, noise, waste, forests, wildlife, and biodiversity. Among the adverse effects of the lockdown, an increase in the volume of healthcare waste (300â400%), an increase in atmospheric ozone levels (30â300%), and an increase in illegal logging in forests and wildlife poaching stood out. GavriluÈÄ et al. (2022) , have presented a paper to examine the changes in the labor market during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, this research is based on the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, especially at the level of the labor market. According to their opinion, the main challenge in sustainable development in the new world conditions is related to human sustainability. In connection with human sustainability, they also emphasize the role of the labor market and employment capability in creating optimal performance at the social and economic levels. To measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the economic domain, they used a quantitative research design based on descriptive and inferential statistics. Some of the research variables include the unemployment rate in the European Union-28 and the employment rate. The findings indicate a deep economic crisis resulting from economic degrowth and high levels of unemployment in the European Union-28.  2.4 Research Gaps Regarding the review of the mentioned literature about COVID-19 outcomes, so far, no model has addressed the effects of the control measurements to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak on various dimensions of human life with a sustainable approach. To the best of our knowledge, many mathematical models have been presented about COVID-19 and the vaccine supply chain, but none of them has taken the socioeconomic and environmental conditions of families during lockdown with the sustainability approach into account. Some authors have only focused on the supply chain, and others have considered the macro issues, such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), only as a conceptual model. Some have also covered these issues in their research, but they have not proposed a mathematical model for it. However, in the current research, the importance of this issue is pointed out, and regarding the sustainability approach, including the socioeconomic and environmental pillars, dimensions of people's lives have been considered. Moreover, a sustainable mathematical model has been presented for the COVID-19 vaccine preparation and distribution.   3 Problem description and model formulation 3.1 Problem description The COVID-19 virus caused major economic and social damages and tremendous loss of life all over the world and imposed tragic experiences on health care providers and professionals. To break the chain of infection and reduce casualties, many governments implemented preventive measures, such as lockdowns. The short-term solution was quite successful in reducing the number of new cases and preventing further damage to the health field; however, it intensified the economic and social damages. In other words, governments suffered socioeconomic, environmental, and other losses caused by lockdowns in favor of health improvements in society by reducing casualties. In spite of this, lockdowns were temporary and emergency measures, and as their duration lengthened, the extent and severity of the damage increased. To break the infection chain and reduce casualties, the procurement of vaccines as a permanent solution was an essential priority. Because vaccination gradually creates a general immunity or collective safety and helps individuals return to their normal lives. Here, the 17 SDGs set by the United Nations are introduced to demonstrate the various aspects of human life. Then, food inflation, unemployment, suicide, and domestic violence rates are selected as representative indicators to show the condition of human life during lockdown, and the relevance of selected indicators to SDGs has been investigated. In the next step, the SDGs related to the indicators are clustered into the sustainability approach pillars. This makes the connection of each indicator to SDGs and the sustainability pillars intelligible. Then, using the model, among the available alternatives of purchasing foreign vaccines, producing domestic vaccines, or a combination of the two, the best option is selected. Therefore, the vaccine can be obtained with the least amount of time and cost and the highest utility, causing the least damage in the four specified indicators. As a result, the immunity created by vaccination breaks the chain of infection and reduces casualties. Therefore, the health status and the economic, social, etc. conditions of the society will be affected by the positive and permanent effects of vaccination, and with the cancellation of the lockdown, the shadow of the negative effects of the lockdown will be removed from the economic, social, etc. dimensions. 3.1.1 Sustainable development goals SDGs can be helpful in understanding how control measures would affect various aspects of human life. We are expressing how these indicators influence various dimensions of human life by framing their impact on SDGs, allowing for a better understanding of their implications. In 2015, United Nations Members approved a plan to improve diverse aspects of sustainability and develop living conditions in the world. The plan named Sustainable Development, including 17 goals (SDGs) with 169 targets, should be pursued to be reached by 2030. In spite of the advancement gained, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, plenty of members face difficulty in reaching the goals under existing trends (Editorial, 2020 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ).  3.1.2 Indicators representing the state of human life during lockdown The following are some outcomes of the control measures for reducing COVID-19 prevalence. Several indicators, including the rate of food inflation, suicide, domestic violence, and unemployment, are selected and explained to understand how such control measures influence human life using the SDGs (Pradhan et al., 2021 ).â¢ Lockdown exerts a negative impact on transportation and the food supply chain and leads to increasing food prices, which itself impairs the family economy. For instance, as announced by the World Food Program (WFP), food prices in Nepal have increased by 20% due to the lockdown, which can affect SDGs 2, 8, 12, and 17.  â¢ Lockdown results in an increase in mental and emotional problems, including higher suicide cases. For example, statistics demonstrate that during the lockdown, the suicide rate in Nepal was 16.5 people per day on average, while under normal conditions, this rate was 15.8 people per day. This factor affects SDGs 3 and 16.  â¢ Lockdown increases domestic violence, particularly against children and women. For instance, the violence against women has doubled during the lockdown in Nepal, which affects SDGs 5 and 16.  â¢ The COVID-19 pandemic led to many job losses worldwide. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), from April to June 2020, 495 million full-time jobs were lost, and almost half of the world's workforce was exposed to the risk of losing their livelihood. Workers in the informal economy, most of whom are women and young workers, have been severely affected by the lockdown (OHCHR, 2021 ). Unemployment and underemployment reduce income and increase domestic violence. For example, in Nepal, 41% of women and 25% of men lost their jobs, which affects SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15 and 16.    Analyzing the economic effects is significant since, during or even after the COVID-19 pandemic, economic decline has strong and adverse impacts on individualsâ mental health (Sher, 2020 ). The SDGs and the representative indicators are demonstrated in Fig. 2  .  3.1.3 Sustainability approach The sustainability approach includes environmental, social, and economic considerations. Concepts like âcohesion of community for mutual benefit, connectedness between groups of people, reciprocity, tolerance, compassion, patience, forbearance, fellowship, love, commonly accepted standards of honesty, discipline, and ethicsâ are central to social sustainability, which focuses on preserving and enhancing social quality (Goodland, 2002 ). Economic sustainability is defined with the aim of developing the standard of living. The goal of environmental sustainability is to maintain natural resources (e.g., land, air, water, minerals, etc.) while enhancing human welfare (Futurelearn, 2017 ). Triple pillars of the sustainability approach are shown in Fig. 3  . Here, the socioeconomic and environmental aspects of sustainability are analyzed in the proposed model. Domestic violence and suicide are categorized into the social pillar class, and food inflation is sorted into the group of economic and social pillars. Ultimately, unemployment is classified in the category of economic, social, and environmental pillars. SDGs and pillars of the sustainability approach are depicted in Fig. 4  .  3.1.4 Immunity and utility As diagnosed by epidemiologists, immunologists, and physicians in the medical sciences area, herd immunity does not take place until a certain percentage (usually 80 % (Hosseini-Motlagh et al., 2023 )) of the total population is vaccinated. Formally, herd immunity is defined by Randolph and Barreiro (2020)  as âthe indirect protection from infection conferred to susceptible individuals when a sufficiently large proportion of immune individuals exist in a populationâ (Sinha et al., 2023 ). According to the present paper's assumptions, the period we study will be until the herd immunity of the virus is achieved. In this paper, to create herd immunity through vaccinating a certain percentage of the population, the vaccine purchase or production is investigated. From the medical sciencesâ perspective, the immunity percentage by vaccination in society has different utilities. Vaccine-induced immunity does not mean the immunity created in every vaccinated person against the disease rather the immunity resulting from the vaccination of a percentage of the target population as a whole. In other words, herd immunity is considered. The resultant utility can be calculated if there is a relationship between the vaccination percentage and the resulting utility; otherwise, the utility can be considered constant. In the present paper, this relationship is assumed to be linear. The created utility depends on the number of vaccinated population (immunity) up to a certain period, so the more the number of vaccinated people, the greater the utility resulting from immunity. Fig. 5   depicts the linear relationship between the created immunity percentage and the utility value. To come up with the line slope in each sector (resulting immunity percentage), Eqs. (1) and (2)  are employed. For example, Eqs. (3) and (4)  show how to calculate the line slope in the second sector.(1) m n  = b n  â b n â 1     a n  â a n â 1          (2) Î² â b n â 1    = m n  . ( Î± â a n â 1     )      (3) m 2  = b 2  â b 1   a 2  â a 1        (4) Î² â b 1  = m 2  . ( Î± â a 1   )         3.2 Assumption â¢ Agents are assumed not to produce during lockdown.  â¢ The long-term consequences of a temporary lockdown are ignored.  â¢ Unless the quantity of vaccination reaches a certain percentage of herd immunity, the COVID-19-related restrictions will continue.  â¢ Because of the lack of available vaccines and, consequently, the necessity of dividing the vaccines among the countries and allocating them based on country-based quotas, a maximum capacity has been considered for producing and importing vaccines.  â¢ In this paper, the immunity-utility relationship has been considered as a linear constant, the slope of which is different in each sector so that the slope of the line is steeper in the initial sector.     3.3 Model formulation The proposed model involves the following indices, sets, parameters, and decision variables.

The first objective function (5) maximizes the utility. The second objective function (6) minimizes the costs of vaccine purchase and production. The third objective function (7) also minimizes the negative effects of lockdown on four selected indicators related to the sustainability approach. Constraint (8) states that at most in one of the periods we decide to start testing and making the vaccines. Constraint (9) indicates that when we decide to make a vaccine, we can have the domestically produced vaccine in the following s  period. As stated by Constraint (10), when we decide to purchase a vaccine, we can have a foreign vaccine in the following sâ  period. Constraint (11) explains that there will definitely be importation in case of ordering. Constraint (12) suggests that the demand met during period t  corresponds to the sum of the quantity of the vaccine produced domestically and the amount of the vaccine purchased from abroad. Constraint (13) indicates that the total population vaccinated in all periods have to be at least equal to the population percentage required for vaccination to achieve herd immunity in the community. Constraint (14) states the immunity percentage created during each period. Constraint (15) states the utility value created in terms of the immunity percentage achieved during period t . Constraint (16) denotes the difference level between the utilities gained in two consecutive periods. Constraints (17) and (18) indicate that we should make a decision to produce or purchase a vaccine when there is enough time to carry out vaccination during the scheduling period. Constraint (19) states that at least s'  units of time is required from the time of order to import the vaccine. Constraints (20) and (21) determine during which period the herd immunity is achieved. Constraints (22) to (24) show the type of the variables.   4 Solution method The multi-objective model proposed in current study is solved by an enhanced version of the augmented Îµ-constrained method (AUGMECON) named AUGMECON 2 as in comparison to previous versions used to solve multi-objective models, it obtains superior results. Solving a multi-objective model leads to generation of a solution set instead of a unique best result due to the existence of more than one objective and optimization of all objectives. In this situation, the most preferred solution is determined based on decision-makersâ preference (Budak, 2020 ). The AUGMECON 2 converts the multi-objective problem to a single-objective one by taking account of an objective function as the major one and the rest as constraints limited to Îµ values. Repetition of this procedure for other objectives is done by computing upper and lower feasible bounds of objectives when they are considered to be constraint (Budak, 2020 ; Liaqait et al., 2022 ). This method shortens the computation time and hastens reaching the solutions by avoidance of unnecessary repetitions (Mavrotas and Florios, 2013 ).  5 Computational results An example of a small-sized problem is designed and solved using random data to validate the proposed model. Then, a case study is introduced, and the performance of the model is evaluated. Finally, the model's sensitivity is analyzed. The data for the small-sized problem are presented in Tables 1 and 2   . 5.1 Numerical experimentation In this section, the proposed model is solved by applying the Augmented Epsilon Constraint 2 method in GAMS software and its results are presented. The Payoff table and the set of Pareto points resulting from this solution are illustrated in Tables 3 and 4   . The set of Pareto solution sets is also demonstrated in Fig. 6  . The variables corresponding to Pareto solution number 2 (marked with â*â in Table 4 ) are indicated in Table 5  , which shows how to supply the vaccines in different periods, the amount of the utility and other related variables. As seen in Table 5 , during the first period, the decision to produce vaccines was made, and after two periods, the domestically produced vaccine was prepared in the third period. Additionally, the purchased foreign vaccine was ordered in the first and second periods, and after the lead time period, it was used in the second and third periods for injection. Taking the amount of vaccine injections into account, the desired immunity would be acquired by the fifth period.  5.2 Case study Iran with a population of 80,971,271 people, based on the statistics of 2018 (Amar, 2019a ), is located in Southwest Asia. On February 18, 2020 in Iran, following the death of two patients with respiratory complications in Kamkar Hospital in Qom, some rumors spread about the death of these patients due to COVID-19. On February 19, the first cases of the COVID-19 were reported in Qom by the public relations of the Ministry of Health. As announced by the head of the Information and Public Relations Center of the Ministry of Health, the preliminary test results for two cases of the COVID-19 infection suspected were reported as positive. Kamkar Hospital in Qom was also identified as the referral point for the suspected COVID-19 cases and its suffering patients, and their quarantine place, and the country entered the alert level of COVID-19 transmission risk. The reasons why Iran is selected as a case study are stated below.â¢ Iran has the potential to make the vaccines.  â¢ This country can supply the vaccine from foreign countries.  â¢ The COVID-19 disease severely spread in some cities, and the lives of the affected people are disturbed.    Despite the limitations in the data collection and lack of accurate and reliable sources to access the data, in this study, efforts were made to include the collected data as much as possible with the reference so that it to be referred to if required and if the data are not available, these data can be estimated using other information. According to the statistics of 2017, to estimate the total demand for food, the total population of the country equal to 80,971,271 is employed (Amar, 2019a ). To estimate the number of employees and also to determine the number of people at risk of suicide, the population over 15 years old is considered. To determine the number of victims of domestic violence, the population of women and children are included (Amar, 2019b ). In this study, the working population includes economically active people (nÂ =Â 27,073,841), retired individuals (nÂ =Â 3,124,997), housewives (nÂ =Â 20,946,787), unemployed people with earning potential (nÂ =Â 1,898,248) and others (nÂ =Â 2,362,517), who are at the working age above 15 years old (Amar, 2019a ). In determining the population of domestic violence, the population of women (nÂ =Â 40,208,793) (Amar, 2019a ) and young boys under ten years old (nÂ =Â 3,048,041) are included. The F r  , U r  , S r     and W r    rates are also achieved based on the statistics of 2020â2021. Moreover, during this period, the price index of food items reached from 39 to 51.5% (Amar, 2022a ). It is worth reminding that the average suicide death rate in the country reached 7.2% from 6% per 100,000 people (Seratnews, 2021 ). Finally, two doses of vaccine are calculated for each 74,875,189 people over 10 years old. Some of these data are given in Table 6  . The fixed cost for ordering each of the two types of domestically produced and foreign-purchased vaccines is considered as $1,000,000 to cover miscellaneous costs (although no technical knowledge has been purchased and it is not launched in the country). To choose a foreign vaccine for purchasing, five options (vaccine supply source) are assumed, which include four types of well-known and reliable vaccines (Sinopharm, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca), and Iran's quota from the COVAX portfolio as a source of foreign vaccine supply. Regarding that no data is at hand about the amount of order and delivery time of Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. Each person's quota in the world is determined using its total production capacity, and then it is estimated how many vaccines can be delivered relative to the population of Iran. The other required data extracted from different sources can be directly used. To calculate the vaccine access capacity for Iran, the sum of their capacities has been taken into account. In terms of their weighted average, vaccine testing and production costs and times are calculated. In the absence of an appropriate and reliable source of information, the transportation costs of foreign vaccines are assumed to be constant. As the Ministry of Health of Iran announced, the onset of the countrywide COVID-19 outbreak is assumed from the beginning of February 2020, based on which the required time for making and testing the vaccine is estimated. The parameters of case study are shown in Table 7  . In order to calculate the availability time of the vaccines, the information in Table 8   is applied. Table 9   displays the final value of some parameters. The world population is assumed to be approximately 7,900,000,000 (Statista, 2022 ). The production capacities are for the year 2020. The total Iran population is assumed as 80,971,271 people, of which 40,762,479 are men and 40,208,793 are women (Amar, 2019a ). The price of each domestic vaccine dose is 7.6 dollars, which is equivalent to 2,000,000 rials based on the Nimai currency exchange rate of 270,000 rials (Tgju, 2022 ). 5.2.1 Computational results of case study In this section, the results of the case study are presented in Tables 10 and 11   . Tables 10 and 11  depict the Payoff table and the achieved Pareto point sets, respectively. Fig. 7   also depicts the set of Pareto points. The variables corresponding to Pareto solution number 1 (marked with â*â in Table 11 ) are indicated in Tables 12â14    , which demonstrate how to supply the vaccines in different periods, the amount of resulted utility, and other related variables. In Fig. 8  , how vaccines are provided and the amount of obtained utility within 24 periods are shown. According to Tables 12â14 , a decision is made in the first period to produce domestic vaccines. Furthermore, foreign vaccines have been ordered since the 1st period and will continue until the 8th period. Therefore, in the 12th period, the foreign vaccine would be available in the distribution system, and it would continue to be available until the 16th period. Between the 16th and 19th periods, both domestic and foreign vaccines would be available for distribution. Thus, by exposing the resulted values, the utility of the vaccination has increased, and the negative social, economic, and environmental effects of prolonging the lockdown period are minimized.  5.2.2 Sensitivity analysis This section analyzes the sensitivity of the model to changes in domestic and foreign vaccine capacity. For this purpose, it is assumed that some vaccines are not available. For instance, it is assumed that Pfizer, Moderna and COVAX vaccines are overlooked and only Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccines are useable and available. For this purpose, the capacity of foreign vaccines reduced from 19,915,220 to 7,708,254 and the results of this change are given in  Tables 15â18 . The values of the variables related to the first Pareto point of Table 15  can be seen in Tables 16â18    . In Fig. 9  , how vaccines are provided and the amount of obtained utility within 24 periods are shown. The reduction in capacity led to an increase in the time required to reach herd immunity from the 17th to the 23rd period. Full immunity (100%) even in the 24th period is not achieved and only 81% of the population is vaccinated. In this case, the negative effects of the preventive measures are almost doubled, and the resulting utility is reduced by around 60%.    6 Discussion and managerial insight The main focus is on considering and giving importance to the collective and individual living conditions that arise during pandemics. In the case of the COVID-19 virus, we aim to highlight this type of significance through the strategic choice between vaccine supply and production as a solution to the challenges posed. Implementing this approach within a country can lead to multifaceted benefits and enhance the overall well-being of the community. Based on the obtained results, the option of purchasing or producing vaccines, while maximizing desirability, minimizing time and cost, and inflicting the least damage across the four predefined indicators, has been recognized as a necessary strategy. This approach is aligned with sustainable development goals and encompasses the three pillars of sustainability: economic, social, and environmental. Economically, investing in vaccines can alleviate pressure on healthcare systems, reduce medical costs, and improve the economic condition through the mitigation or reduction of various constraints, particularly long-term restrictions (lockdowns). Socially, widespread vaccination not only saves lives from severe disease consequences but also increases public confidence in public health measures, leading to reduced misinformation, diminished fear, and enhanced overall mental well-being. Furthermore, it ensures social equality by guaranteeing equitable vaccine access for all segments of society. Environmentally, vaccination can minimize the negative ecological impacts associated with pandemic management. Vaccination-induced immunity reduces the reliance on personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves, consequently reducing medical waste and contributing to environmental improvement. Therefore, on one hand, achieving vaccination, by mitigating the economic, social, and environmental damages outlined in the SDGs related to the pillars of sustainability, reduces the burden. On the other hand, it elevates community health status. This transforms vaccination into an ideal alternative to lockdowns. By establishing herd immunity through vaccination, it will have a positive and lasting impact on various aspects of human life, including economic, social, and health-related aspects. Furthermore, the conclusion can be drawn that for achieving herd immunity through vaccination, the world must utilize credible and approved sources for vaccine procurement. Should any distribution system refrain from utilizing domestic or foreign vaccines for whatever reason, it will slow down the vaccination process, resulting in irreparable, detrimental, and costly effects from the perspective of sustainability pillars. In other words, the more restricted the access to vaccines, the delayed the completion of vaccination, leading to increased, severe, and prolonged disease spread within the community, consequently imposing greater casualties, damages, and costs upon the society. Therefore, investing in vaccination as primary response to pandemics can enhance societal resilience, reduce short-term damages, and bring about a faster and more sustainable recovery for the community.  7 Conclusions and future researches A mathematical model for the provision of vaccine was presented in this study, taking account of the socioeconomic and environmental pillars of the sustainability approach. The model optimizes the utility associated with vaccination-induced immunity, procurement of vaccine costs, and the negative effects caused by preventive measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the form of four indicators regarding the SDGs and the pillars of sustainability. The utility of a vaccination is dependent on the number of people who have been vaccinated up to a certain point in time; in other words, the more the number of people who have been vaccinated, the greater the utility. Among the most important aspects of this research are the rates of food inflation, unemployment, suicide, and domestic violence. During the lockdown period, these indicators demonstrate the effects of the control measures to break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 on human life. Based on the solution of the proposed model, the best option among the options of purchasing foreign vaccines, producing domestic vaccines, and combining the two is determined. Out of the results through solving the model using the case study data, it can be concluded that all possible capacities for the supply, distribution, and injection of the available vaccines should be used to achieve herd immunity within the shortest possible time. If the potential capacities to meet the demand for the existing vaccines are ignored or remain unused for any reason, the negative effects of these preventive measures may increase up to two times, and it would be impossible to achieve the desired results even in a longer time. Hence, it results in severe damage to the families economically, psychologically, and socially. In future research, the rates of income reduction and increase of domestic violence can be considered as uncertainty due to their nature, and they can be used in a robust model and apply them more favorably. Additionally, other indicators may be used to represent different aspects of people's lives in future models and obtain more comprehensive and realistic results.
