                  The urgency to overcome climate change under COP 26 and 27 has allowed closer attention towards environmental sustainability. As a result, businesses are under pressure from stakeholders to provide more information about greenhouse gas emissions and ecological footprints. The current study performs a systematic review of firm-level carbon disclosure under carbon disclosure project (CDP) publications to articulate key research themes based on bibliographic coupling, citation mapping and content analysis. VOSViewer was used to analyze carbon disclosure literature to provide a comprehensive overview of research themes, most-contributing authors, research journals, and keywords. Our findings reveal that climate change strategies, carbon footprint and market response to climate change (cluster 1), carbon information, stock market & financial performance and impact of environmental penalties over the cost of capital (cluster 2), GHG disclosure, stakeholder relevance and BOD effectiveness in environmental strategies (cluster 3) and determinants for dissemination of environmental information, carbon mitigation, and carbon management systems (cluster 4) are the most significant research themes within the existing research. Based on our research analysis, we provide several key policy recommendations to use carbon disclosure practices as a benchmark in evaluating firms’ commitment to environmental sustainability.

Handling Editor: A. Sinha Graphical abstract       The urgency to overcome climate change under COP 26 and 27 has allowed closer attention towards environmental sustainability. As a result, businesses are under pressure from stakeholders to provide more information about greenhouse gas emissions and ecological footprints. The current study performs a systematic review of firm-level carbon disclosure under carbon disclosure project (CDP) publications to articulate key research themes based on bibliographic coupling, citation mapping and content analysis. VOSViewer was used to analyze carbon disclosure literature to provide a comprehensive overview of research themes, most-contributing authors, research journals, and keywords. Our findings reveal that climate change strategies, carbon footprint and market response to climate change (cluster 1), carbon information, stock market & financial performance and impact of environmental penalties over the cost of capital (cluster 2), GHG disclosure, stakeholder relevance and BOD effectiveness in environmental strategies (cluster 3) and determinants for dissemination of environmental information, carbon mitigation, and carbon management systems (cluster 4) are the most significant research themes within the existing research. Based on our research analysis, we provide several key policy recommendations to use carbon disclosure practices as a benchmark in evaluating firms’ commitment to environmental sustainability.   Keywords Carbon disclosure  Literature review  Carbon disclosure project  Environmental sustainability  Sustainable Development Goals    1 Introduction In recent years, there has been growing interest from the general public, policymakers and environmental stakeholders to examine the quality of carbon reporting and other environmental strategies to tackle climate change (Alsaifi et al., 2020 ; Bashir et al., 2023) . Our evaluation of global compliance with environmental goals indicates that the exponential consumption of fossil fuels underlines efforts toward worldwide net-zero emissions by the year 2050 (Sadiq et al., 2022 ). Current statistics from World Bank reveal that due to pressure from policymakers, 1540 global companies and 823 cities from 127 countries have introduced environmental strategies to decarbonize the environment as regulators have accelerated the implementation of environmental policies to limit carbon reduction (Bashir et al., 2022a,b; Ma et al., 2022 ). European Climate Law has introduced the 2030 Climate Target Plan and 2050 climate neutrality objective to reduce carbon emissions by at least 50 % until 2030 (Hussain et al., 2021; Talbi et al., 2022 ). New Zealand and China, among other countries, have passed emission trading schemes to cap carbon emissions and introduce mandatory carbon disclosure requirements. In the past seven years, China alone has emitted 26,000 tons of carbon emissions (Bashir et al., 2020 ). Against the above-mentioned backdrop, we stress that firms need to employ internal and external reporting mechanisms to improve carbon performance and achieve carbon reduction targets. Trucost (2019) , a subsidiary of S&P Global, examined the management of climate-related risks and carbon emissions reports of 2500 global firms to reveal that although reporting and standard practices of climate change have improved but still need greater transparency and a stronger commitment to tackling environmental challenges in a meaningful way. Sullivan and Gouldson (2012)  reviewed UK’s environmental policies to conclude that British firms face consistent criticism from stakeholders for not providing value-relevant carbon disclosure information and highlighted several issues within reporting standards to improve carbon communication. Overall current carbon disclosure literature indicates that two strands of literature dominate current research contribution and lead to some contradiction/debate. In the first strand, researchers criticize the firms by arguing that firms operating in emerging economies show minimal interest in carbon disclosure and provide carbon information in a way that is ceremonial rather than authentic (Leung et al., 2015 ). It is further suggested that similar to sustainability initiatives and other non-financial reporting (Bose and Khan, 2022 ), firms attempt to impress stakeholders, especially shareholders, by engaging in carbon disclosure rather than implementing these practices as authentic in-house practices (Comyns and Figge, 2015 ). Several researchers argue that firms use window-dressing of carbon disclosure so that stakeholders pay little or no attention to carbon performance (Cotter et al., 2011 ). The second strand of carbon disclosure argues that carbon disclosure by firms reflects their pledge towards environmental sustainability, and available carbon information is a critical element in investors’ decision-making (Luo and Tang, 2014; Matsumura et al., 2014 ). Alsaifi et al. (2020)  have reported that carbon disclosure positively affects stock market investment. Giannarakis et al. (2017) and Warburg et al. (2021)  also confirmed the association between carbon disclosure and environmental sustainability, suggesting that detailed carbon reporting is critical in further environmental legislation (Xia et al., 2022 ). From above mentioned academic discussion, we take inspiration to identify & overcome existing research gaps in carbon disclosure literature and how we can affect future studies. We use bibliometric analysis to identify and explore research dynamics related to “firm-level carbon disclosure” and provide suggestions to improve the research output further, as no previous study has investigated carbon information literature through systematic literature. For this, we provide an overview of scientific literature through the following queries. RQ1: which journals have published the most scientific literature on carbon disclosure? RQ2: what is the co-citation trend among journals publishing carbon disclosure literature? RQ3: what are the most frequent keywords? and how do they shape research trends? RQ4: what does network visualization of co-authorship among countries tell us? RQ5: Which authors dominate the carbon disclosure literature? RQ6: How does co-authorship among research scholars affect academic contribution? RQ7: how do co-citations influences the research direction of future studies? RQ8: what are the main research trends in academic publications? and how do sub-groups within these trends affect the overall research direction? Answering these questions would serve as a baseline for researchers to critically analyze scientific publications and suggest policy guidelines to overcome scientific limitations (Bashir et al., 2022b–d ). The objective of the current research project is to identify the significance of carbon disclosure publications within sustainability literature. And closely examining the alignment between carbon disclosure & corporate environmental strategies will allow us to reveal their impact on different ecological stakeholders (Velte et al., 2020 ). The novelty of current research lies in the following ways. Firstly, the understanding of carbon disclosure and its character through a systematic review process has previously been ignored in current economic literature. In this regard, we provide a detailed outlook on the reliability and relevance of the reported carbon information and related attributes to decrease environmental pollutants. Second, we present a series of research questions to document current literature by comprehensively capturing the construct quality of carbon information (Bashir, 2018; Bashir et al., 2015 ). Third, we extend carbon literature by providing an in-depth account of variations in research direction by identifying sub-topics within dominant research clusters. This would provide a more holistic understanding to the perspective reader about environmental sustainability through a wider lens. Last, our systematic approach allows us to propose several key policy suggestions to improve current carbon reporting and ecological standards (Bashir et al., 2022d,e ). This paper is structured as First, we evaluate existing literature and theoretical contribution toward carbon disclosure. Then, we present the methodology and summary of the main findings and various statistics extracted from carbon disclosure publications. Next, we discuss carbon disclosure papers with respect to bibliographic coupling to explain the main research themes within selected studies. Finally, we provide a research conclusion and future research direction.  2 Data and methodology for bibliometric analysis In order to comprehensively evaluate firm-level carbon disclosure research publications, we follow the most recent bibliographic research (Bashir et al., 2021b; Shahbaz et al., 2021 ), where bibliographic analysis was used for a systematic literature review. Our first step in selecting a dataset of carbon disclosure literature involved using Web of Science (WOS) and SCOPUS databases to search for published literature, as these indexes search across publishers without exhibiting biasness towards publishers, ensuring that the inclusion of all relevant papers and academic journals (Bashir et al., 2021c ). Following the guidelines to conduct bibliometric analysis (Bashir, 2022a, 2022b ), a panel of academic researchers was consulted to identify relevant keywords, where our research relied on TS = (firm level*) AND TS = (firm*) AND TS = (carbon disclosure*) AND TS = (carbon* OR disclosure*) AND TS = (Carbon disclosure project* OR CDP*), where the “TS” operator helped filter research results in terms of keywords, abstracts and titles. We filtered scientific literature to include research articles and working papers/reports published in English. The initial search yielded 606 and 359 articles from WOS and SCOPUS, respectively. Next, for WOS, we read the abstracts, titles and then full text to identify and remove the 274 topics. Furthermore, the remaining publications were evaluated through a panel discussion and deleted another 81 studies which were unrelated to firm-level carbon disclosure. Finally, we selected 247 studies to measure the firm-level response to compliance with carbon disclosure initiatives. For the SCOPUS database, our initial query generated 329 research items. We removed 139 items to ensure compliance with topic selection and 64 articles to delte studies unrelated to firm-level carbon disclosure. During the final consolidation process, we removed 96 duplicate items appearing in both datasets to arrive at the final sample size of 336 studies. In total, 572 authors have contributed to carbon disclosure publications in 121 research journals; these authors belong to 320 universities and research institutions from 49 countries. We used VOSViewer software for bibliometric analysis of carbon disclosure; the co-occurrence of key terms from the title and abstract were analyzed, where each circle represents each term and a corresponding label. Furthermore, the distance shown in graphical representations determines the association between key terms, and the number of occurrences determines the circle dimension (van Eck and Waltman, 2014 ). Lastly, considering abstracts and titles avoids unnecessary recurrence of terms in the rest of the research publications. We selected co-authorship, citation analysis, bibliometric coupling, and co-citation to determine the research trend (Arslan et al. 2021 ). For the main analysis, we used VOSviewer to identify the clusters through bibliographic coupling (Kessler, 1963 ) as a ratio to aggregate the dataset to ensure the similarity amongst published literature through shared references. This methodology identifies the degree of overlap references among selected datasets. As the number of citations in a published article remains constant over time, compared with other bibliometric tools, the bibliographic coupling is beneficial for conducting a systematic literature review. VOSviewer visualizes results through co-occurrence matrix, where co-occurrence emanates from the proximity and frequency of similar cited references in the dataset (Liu et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2021a; MA et al., 2021b ). Additionally, the software constructs a two-dimensional map where N items are separated from each other based on the degree of cited references X and Y. Additionally, it also performs a cluster density view; every cluster is identified through specific color, where the item density of the corresponding cluster is equaled by the weigh of the color. This produces a graphical output where the more shaded color means lower density (Ma et al., 2020a,b ). To be precise, the distance among articles indicates relatedness in cited references. Also, when some publications belong to the same cluster, it indicates that they are linked as a group on the basis of shared references. The bibliographic coupling process allowed us to identify-four clusters of research items. Our last step involves a comprehensive examination of four identified clusters to ensure that from a theoretical and qualitative point of view, the identified clusters analyzed the same topics originating from the same stream of literature. Following the methodologies of systematic literature review (Colicchia and Strozzi, 2012 ), sampled articles were quantitatively analyzed and read. We prepared an excel dataset to collect the relevant qualitative and quantitative information to identify evolutionary topics or research trends through ad hoc pivot tables. This process helped the review panel to select relevant texts and tag them with keywords representing content. The research team adopted a dynamic tagging process so that researchers could include new tags to promote flexibility in information categorization and reduce possible biasness from the pre-set rigid system (Bashir et al., 2021a; Lei et al., 2022 ).  3 Results and discussion for bibliometric outcomes Under section 3 will present graphical results generated from bibliometric analysis; our focus will be on highlighting the scientific contributions of the most productive authors, countries, and research journals, identifying key terms and performing citation analysis (Bashir, 2022a; Lei et al., 2022 ). 3.1 Leading research journals Fig. 1   represents a co-citation analysis of source journals and confirms that business strategy and the environment (IF = 10.801) and Journal of Cleaner Production (IF = 11.072) have the most significant research contribution due to most publications than other academic journals. Additionally, Fig. 2   also represents some journals whose core research interest is outside of environmental issues in one cluster (Accounting auditing and accountability journal; European accounting review). Table 1   provides further information, where research journals are ranked based on citations related to carbon disclosure; link value, the strength of the links, and cluster number provide additional insights. VOSViewer identifies clusters by focusing on individuals, which in the current state is citations and then groups them into one cluster. Therefore, within the list of most cited journals, five belong to cluster 1. In bibliographic studies, this scenario is common (Schramme, 2019 ) and shows a strong association among journals that cite research work published within the same group (Selmer, 2018 ). Links identify the one-on-one association between the remaining indicators and the source journals. Link is also useful in identifying published material and citations from the same source journal, and link strength points out commonly cited references within any research publication. Therefore, the authors identify Business Strategy and The Environment for the highest links strength; this shows that publications are significantly cited for references within carbon disclosure literature.  3.2 Citation analysis of research journals Next, the association for research items is determined to highlight the ratio of every journal citing other research journals. According to Fig. 3  , Business strategy and the environment and Journal of cleaner production cite each other the most. Also, the association between Sustainability, the Journal of Business Ethics and the British Accounting Review is also noteworthy. Similar relatedness is also particularly visible among journals such as the Journal of Cleaner Production and Organization & Environment. Fig. 2  showcases significant relatedness between the journals from the same research field (carbon disclosure).  3.3 Most common keywords With a minimum occurrence of 5, Fig. 4   shows keywords in publications (where brighter color means recent keywords). The largest group of keywords has researched earnings management, carbon disclosure, carbon footprint and climate change have studied legitimacy theory & sustainability reporting by management. Next, cluster 2, represented by corporate disclosure, corporate social responsibility and innovation, has mainly discussed how carbon disclosure fuels environmental innovation and acceptance of environmental reforms. The third largest cluster of keywords has focused on disclosure, environmental performance and emerging market to extend the academic discussion in emerging Asian economies. The fourth largest cluster has documented the impact of environmental disclosure on corporate financial and economic performances, especially in developed economies, as businesses are under pressure from stakeholders to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The fifth cluster has discussed how firm administrations create a balance between the flow of environmental information and firm value through legitimacy theory. Lastly, the smallest cluster has addressed the impact of environmental and carbon disclosures on carbon footprint, management policies and environmental sustainability in the long run. Table 2   shows the relevant terms from carbon disclosure publications, which are graphically represented in Fig. 3 . Following Nakauchi et al. (2003) , we suggest that emerging research areas, such as carbon disclosure, encourage researchers to use specific terms. After careful examination, we can identify that most of the terms are associated with climate change and environmental performance as these are the most aged research areas. Table 2  highlights scientific terms from carbon disclosure publications based on their frequencies (Garcia et al., 2019 ). Lastly, 'climate change', 'carbon disclosure' and 'environmental performance' also have the highest citation, which indicates that carbon disclosure is attracting significant research interest from academicians.  3.4 Countries Scientific collaboration among researchers allows the transfer of knowledge and ideas to improve the existing research standards, which is why the analysis of research collaboration greatly influences research in emerging fields such as carbon disclosure. We use Fig. 5   to show co-authorship to highlight researchers currently engaged in carbon disclosure. We can observe that carbon disclosure publications are attributed to 9 clusters. Australia (43), the USA (46), and England (34) have coauthored most research documents. Such analysis is useful in revealing academic and scientific cooperation between researchers, institutes, and countries. Table 3   shows the country-wise research contribution in descending order. As previously suggested, co-creation positively correlates with research collaboration among researchers from different countries (Liu and Chen, 2012 ). Furthermore, we can disclose that the average year of scientific contribution for China, Germany and Canada is 2020 and 2021, significantly distinct from countries with the highest publication, such as Australia, the USA, and England.  3.5 Authors/co-citations To further our research analysis, we examine individual research contributions, co-authorship, most productive authors, and co-citation analysis. Following this, Fig. 6   illustrates research contributions from respective authors on carbon disclosure, while Table 4  details further research indicators. Following Table 4   and Fig. 6 , we can conclude that academic researchers with at least four research publications Le Luo and Tang Qingliang have significantly higher research contributions than the rest of the others. While Schiemann, Da Silva Gomez and Lee have also made a significant contribution. These researchers are attributed to the highest avg publication years, which reflects their academic influence and scientific contribution in recent years.  3.6 Co-authorship analysis In the current section, we aim to provide further detail about the co-authorship network. To achieve this, the coauthored document is used as an evaluation criterion. Fig. 7   provides visualization, where key authors can be divided into three clusters. Luo has coauthored 11 research papers within our selected sample documents, while Tang has coauthored eight publications. We further detail the citation trend for the influential coauthors. Tang QL and Luo L have the most citations, as a scientific discussion with analytical and theoretical arguments supports the research. We also reveal a significant proportion of Tang and Luo's work published in Business Strategy and The Environment, British Accounting Review, and the Journal of International Accounting Research. Most of these publications address corporate governance structure and its role in carbon transparency, determinants of carbon management systems, and voluntary carbon disclosure strategies in the context of achieving environmental sustainability (Bashir et al. 2021e ).  3.7 Co-citation Next, Fig. 8   identifies the co-citation relatedness of scientific publications based on standard criteria of them being cited together. Kolk, Luo, and Clarkson are the most cited authors, respectively. Other significant contributors with relatedness and citations are Deegan, Stanny, Patten and Freedman. Fig. 8  is further helpful in identifying the multidisciplinary research association within scientific publications related to carbon disclosure could be further enhanced with researchers working in similar but distinct research fields (Fig. 9  ).   4 Discussion of clusters Cluster 1: Climate change strategies, carbon footprint and market response to climate change. The most dominating cluster is represented by red color, where researchers have mainly discussed climate strategies, carbon footprint and market response to carbon disclosure. The first section of studies in this cluster critically evaluated how corporations responded to environmental degradation and introduced environmental agenda at the organizational level to ensure environmental sustainability. Kolk et al. (2008)  is the most significant article, where the researchers used a GHG reporting mechanism to document corporate response towards climate change. The researchers suggested that institutional investors use CDP participation to encourage further disclosure about climate change. However, subsequent carbon disclosure may not be particularly valuable for policymakers, investors or NGOs. Weinhofer and Hoffmann (2010)  used stakeholders’ interests as the benchmark to check compliance with environmental standards to conclude that half of the sampled firms comply with selected objectives while the remaining follow parallel emission management to achieve strategic objectives as an absolute volume of carbon emissions, firm size and regional affiliation impact carbon reduction strategies. Blanco et al. (2017)  scrutinized climate change strategies to argue that for environmental regulations to be effective, policymakers must overcome biasness toward investments in renewable energy and the interests of different stakeholders must be considered in policy making. Another essential topic is the role of carbon footprint in environmental degradation and responsive environmental strategies to overcome these challenges. Chang et al. (2015)  used a data envelopment model to evaluate how carbon information can improve environmental performance. The researchers concluded that fossil-based energy significantly affects energy structure, though industry-specific reforms are required to overcome differences in environmental performance amongst different industries. Backman et al. (2017)  used a resource-based view to evaluate how investments in technology and information management affect climate mitigation in North America and Europe. The researchers contended that though European firms have higher capabilities in information management and governance, North American firms outperform European firms in actual environmental performance in the long run. Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al. (2020)  evaluated data from the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program to conclude that stakeholder willingness influences organizations to choose which mechanisms to implement, increase organizational capabilities, and overcome barriers to LCO practices. Lastly, Radu et al. (2020)  used independent content analysis to disclose how carbon and environmental strategies affect corporate environmental strategies to show that most firms have low proactivity in non-integrated strategies, while only a small portion simultaneously provide information about carbon and environmental proactivity. The rise of globalization and trade openness means that environmental regulations affect a number of different stakeholders. Consequently, researchers have studied how market forces perceive carbon communication. Lee et al. (2015)  investigated how the role of voluntary carbon disclosure in Korea reflects on shareholder value and capital markets to conclude that carbon disclosure has a negative perception amongst investors as it leads to concern about additional costs to overcome environmental challenges. While moderating carbon communication is critical in determining the association between shareholder value and carbon disclosure. Bui and Fowler (2019)  evaluated governmental climate change policies related to carbon accounting and climate change strategies to argue that strategic differentiation, strategic conformance, operational conformance, avoidance and negotiation are key determinants by market forces for a strategic response toward environmental changes. Earlier, Sullivan and Gouldson (2012)  opinioned that large corporations face criticism from investors for lack of information about carbon emissions, while companies criticize investors for not using available data. The study analyzed both views to conclude that available information lacks quality, hinders investment decisions, and signaled that a combination of mandatory and voluntary reporting is the most obvious solution to these issues. At this point, we can summarize the main propositions from cluster 1:1. To overcome biasness within environmental policies, governments should protect the interests of environmental stakeholders.  2. Firms must be encouraged to be environmentally proactive.  3. Investor acceptability can exemplify the long-term success of the environmental agenda at the firm level.  4. Policymakers must overcome barriers towards renewable energy in developing economies to ease energy transition and environmental compliance.    Cluster 2: Carbon information, stock market & financial performance and impact of environmental penalties over the cost of capital. Cluster 2 (green color) has the second most publication with a focus on how carbon disclosure affects firm stock market performance and investors’ perception. Antoniuk (2022)  researched climate risk within investor portfolios through climate and carbon disclosures. The analysis through the value-weighted approach indicated a 1.3 % higher return for firms complying with environmental regulations. From a policy perspective, the authors suggested that aligning investment strategy with climate regulations offers lower market risk through sortino ratios. Beauchamp and Cormier (2022)  used two-step regression to evaluate embedded carbon emission in the oil gas sector for North American firms to outline that environmental information is positively related to embedded emissions, institutional ownership, firm size and share price volatility. Alessi et al. (2021)  researched individual stock returns in EU firms to test the existence of negative ‘greenium’. The researchers examined portfolio exposure to the carbon transition scenario to indicate that environmental transparency allows EU banks to hedge against market risks and outperform brown stocks in the long run. The second group of studies within cluster 2 evaluated firms’ decarbonization strategies and their impact on financial performance. Alsaifi et al. (2022)  sampled environmental information from FTSE350 listed firms’ voluntary carbon disclosure to suggest that the availability of carbon information contributed to firms avoiding idiosyncratic, systematic and firms’ total risks. Moreover, additional robustness checks suggest that environmental disclosure allows investors to better assess firms’ sustainability framework. Busch et al. (2022)  assessed the carbon and GHG information sensitivity to disclose that in the presence of emissions performance criteria as a control variable, higher emissions positively correlate with long-term financial performance. To overcome this, policy intervention mechanisms to ensure low carbon transition must be implemented at the institutional level. Downar et al. (2021)  assessed the impact of mandated carbon reporting’s association with financial performance in UK firms. The researchers used a scenario-based approach to conclude that firms with mandated requirements reduced GHG emissions 8 % more, though it has no significant impact on financial performances. Wang et al. (2020)  researched financial performance by incorporating liquidity, institutional ownership and analyst coverage for 289 selected Chinese firms to reveal that emissions disclosure is positively related to financial performance. The researchers further documented that liquidity and analyst coverage mediate the relationship between financial performance and environmental disclosure. Another significant strand of the current cluster explored how failure to comply with environmental regulations and subsequent environmental penalties impact the cost of equity, especially in manufacturing & industrial sectors. Ding and Shahzad (2022)  empirically analyzed how failure to disclose environmental information affects the cost of equity within the industrial sector. The selection of bootstrap and OLS allowed researchers to conclude that environmental penalties increase equity costs as disclosure increment positively affects environmental information. Furthermore, non-compliance with environmental regulations continues to impact long-term equity costs negatively. Ding et al. (2022)  extended the academic discussion by researching debt financing for environmental non-compliance within the Chinese manufacturing sector to indicate that firms face a higher cost of equity if environmental penalties are levied. Also, penalized firms' lower environmental disclosure further increases the cost of financing resources in the long run. Gerged et al. (2021)  extended the discussion by analyzing mandatory carbon disclosure and the cost of capital through the longitudinal database for 350 FTSE firms through PQR and GMM approach to report a linear relationship as higher emissions significantly increase the cost of capital. The allowed them to propose that environmental risks and information are closely linked, and firms with higher emissions risk provide better disclosures. Lastly, Bui et al. (2020)  tested the empirical dataset comprising 4655 observations from 34 countries to indicate that emission intensity has a linear impact on the cost of capital; however, extensive carbon disclosure moderates such an association. Additionally, the degree of environmental disclosure reduces environmental premiums to hedge investors against poor environmental performances. The main propositions from cluster 2 are:1. Environmental transparency will allow firms to hedge against market risks and outperform brown stocks in the long run.  2. Environmental disclosure will allow investors to assess firm survival during unforeseen economic and financial crises.  3. Policy intervention mechanisms at the institutional level must be implemented to ensure a low-carbon transition.    Cluster 3: GHG disclosure, BOD diversity, stakeholder relevance and BOD effectiveness in environmental strategies. The rise of corporate governance reforms in recent years has meant that every new regulation affects several stakeholders. Studies belonging to cluster 3 (blue color) evaluated the relevance of corporate governance towards environmental regulations. This section's most dominant research stream evaluated the extent to which board gender diversity impacts GHG disclosure. Liao et al. (2015)  sampled carbon data from 329 UK firms to evaluate how board composition affects voluntary carbon disclosure to report that board-level environmental committees and diversified board synchronizes financial and non-financial goals to ensure compliance with environmental goals but also moderates stakeholders’ expectations about disparate interests. Ben-Amar et al. (2017)  researched how board gender diversity can influence multinational firms to comply with climate change regulations. The researchers used Canadian firm-level data to report a bidirectional causal association between the number of women in BOD and voluntary carbon disclosure. Moreover, they reinforced the opinion that BOD diversity contributes to board effectiveness towards stakeholder management. Lastly, Charumathi and Rahman (2019)  studied how women's representation influences climate change disclosures, formulate GHG mitigation strategies and how communication of environmental information with stakeholders. The study relied on the carbon disclosure project in India for 2010–16 to suggest that female directors push firms to be more environmentally sustainable. The rise of globalization means that corporations need to pay attention to the evaluation from several stakeholders, not just shareholders. Moreover, recent environmental regulations mean stakeholders can impact environmental regulations, which can impact corporation performance. Liesen et al. (2015)  investigated the extent to which external stakeholders can encourage EU corporations to comply with GHG disclosures. The researchers used secondary data from 2005 to 09 to conclude that only 1/6th of sampled businesses comply with GHG reporting requirements. On the other hand, the study acknowledged that external pressure does contribute to GHG disclosure, but a mandatory environmental disclosure or direct stakeholder pressure will likely ensure higher compliance with environmental standards. Akbaş and Canikli (2018)  used “sensitiveness tendency” and “transparency tendency” as the main indicators of BOD’s response towards environmental reforms to conclude that market forces pressure institutional ownership and firm market value to increase environmental transparency. Similarly, Chithambo et al. (2020)  reported that regulatory pressure from stakeholders is critical in higher GHG disclosure in carbon-intensive industries. Lastly, Cotter and Najah (2012)  reported that institutional investors use corporate communication channels to ensure that firms not only adopt environmental strategies but also improve the quality of information within CDP information. The board of directors is integral in formulating and implementing corporate strategies. In the available literature, several studies analyzed the effectiveness of BODs in environmental strategies. In this regard, Ben‐Amar and McIlkenny (2015)  followed BOD’s role in encouraging compliance with carbon disclosure. The researchers reported a positive association between BOD effectiveness and firm’s decision to comply with CDP regulations and quality of carbon reporting, which allows BOD to increase transparency in carbon information and how it can further accelerate compliance with voluntary and mandatory carbon standards. Barka and Dardour (2015)  continued this discussion by surveying 20 listed French corporations to empirically validate that the firm directors are the most relevant attributes in firms participating in carbon disclosure projects. Though, the researchers also suggested that multivariate and modeling analysis are critical in determining the extent to which BOD can influence carbon reporting standards in firms with high CSR scores. In recent times, Elsayih et al. (2018)  explored how corporate governance mechanisms can affect carbon disclosure in Australia. The study provided empirical evidence that independent directors and managerial ownership structure significantly correlate with carbon transparency in the long run. And stressed that current corporate governance standards must focus on non-financial goals, allowing BOD to create value augmentation through better environmental protection. The main propositions from Cluster 3 are:1. Firm environmental committees must act to balance corporate and environmental goals to ensure compliance with the environmental agenda.  2. Mandatory environmental disclosure and direct stakeholder pressure will force corporations to comply more with environmental standards.  3. BOD diversity contributes to higher compliance with CDP regulations and carbon reporting.    Cluster 4: Determinants for dissemination of environmental information, carbon mitigation, and carbon management systems. Cluster 4 (yellow color) is the smallest cluster of empirical studies but contains some interesting topics that have further extended the scope of economic literature by exploring new research directions. Among the most prominent topics, several studies have explored different determinants of the dissemination of environmental information. Giannarakis et al. (2016)  is the most critical study in the topic, which used the carbon disclosure leadership index and environmental disclosure scores to disclose that country’s risk premium and environmental reforms are the most significant determinants for the flow of carbon information, while firms value has an insignificant impact during the dissemination of carbon disclosure. Kouloukoui et al. (2018)  furthered the debate by investigating the top 100 global firms to identify the determinates of climate risks and used content analysis to suggest that sampled firms had less tendency to disclose environmental performance accurately; however, due to public pressure, have focused on BOD efficiency to increase the relevance within emissions information. Tadros et al. (2020)  empirically tested empirical data from US firms to evaluate environmental performance to monitor whether or not carbon disclosure tends to have biasness with new information. The main findings from the empirical analysis revealed that mandating carbon disclosures constitutes a higher degree of carbon information availability and lowers firm discretion about the disclosure of carbon statistics. The second most distinguished topic within cluster 4 explores how the political environment impacts the degree of carbon disclosure. Hoover and Fafatas (2018)  sampled S&P 500 firms’ dataset to suggest that firms headquartered in states with governors from the Democratic party tend to provide more carbon information and receive higher scores than Republican states, which is attributed to strict regulatory requirements by Democratic-party led state legislators. Luo et al. (2018)  researched firm carbon performance to conclude that countries with higher power distance tend to legitimize; meaning lower concentration of power reduces carbon opaqueness and results in higher CSR as cultural preferences influence climate change policymaking. Luo (2019)  selected global 500 firms to investigate how institutional context influenced carbon emissions and carbon disclosure and determined that legitimation influences the decision to disclose carbon information. Although, stringent institutions can more accurately reflect performance by restricting legitimation attempts. Lastly, a small group of researchers considered the introduction of carbon management systems’ impact on carbon mitigation scenarios. Tang and Luo (2014)  conducted a pioneer study by sampling an empirical dataset related to 10 BOD indicators to test how proactive strategies, cross-functional integration and group accountability influence the implementation of carbon management systems. The research concluded that CMS mitigates emissions and the strength of carbon programs and adequate assessment of carbon risk and opportunity are the most significant indicators to ensure carbon transparency. Moreover, integrating carbon communication strategies, tracking ecological footprint, and internal policy processes improve environmental decision-making. Ott et al. (2017)  extracted a firm-level dataset from 60 emerging economies to reveal that firms’ compliance with environmental disclosure depends upon the publication of CSR reports, implementation of EMS and availability of financial resources, whereas proprietary costs and environmental performances influence the extent to which carbon information is made available to the investors and general public. Our main propositions derived from Cluster 4 are:1. Public pressure has led to BOD increasing its efficiency to reveal a higher degree of emissions-related disclosure.  2. The political situation affects compliance with environmental regulations and the degree to which carbon information is made public.  3. The strength of environmental policies and carbon risk assessment are the most significant indicators within environmental reporting.     5 Conclusion, limitation and research Implications: The current study aims to deepen the understanding of academic publications related to carbon disclosure policies. We provide significant insights through a systematic literature review of scientific publications from the 1999–2022. The primary analysis was conducted through bibliometric coupling to identify prevalent research trends, as most analytical studies suggest that carbon disclosure practices positively correlate with environmental quality. Our analysis identifies four main research clusters in the current literature, where Cluster 1 consists of articles that address climate change strategies, carbon footprint and market response to climate change. Our review indicates that institutional investors use participation in CDP to encourage further disclosure about climate change, industry-specific reforms are required to overcome differences in environmental information, and carbon disclosure has a negative perception amongst investors as it leads to concern about needing additional costs to overcome environmental challenges. The second cluster mainly focuses on carbon information, stock market & financial performance and the impact of environmental penalties over the cost of capital. Studies in this cluster suggest that aligning investment strategy with climate regulations leads to lower market risk, better environmental disclosure would allow investors to assess firms’ sustainability standards accurately, and the dangers of a higher cost of capital from non-compliance with environmental regulations means that carbon information disclosure is on the trend among the industrial sector. Next, cluster 3 highlights the role of BOD diversity, stakeholders’ relevance and BOD effectiveness in environmental strategies. Studies in this cluster project that boardroom policies can increase corporate response towards environmental policies. Moreover, there is significant research potential within these fields, as only a handful of studies have provided insightful policy insights. This cluster has also considered the introduction of EU environmental strategies, which aim to primarily address the shortcoming of implementing sustainable environmental policies to help analyze the corporate willingness to achieve sustainable development goals. Lastly, studies in cluster 4 have analyzed the determinants for the dissemination of environmental information, pollution mitigation, and carbon management systems. The main findings from this cluster insinuate that mandating carbon disclosures constitutes a higher degree of carbon information availability, lower concentration of power reduces carbon opaqueness and results in higher CSR. Moreover, introducing a carbon management system helps accurately assess carbon risk from environmental pollutants. Our detailed analysis of carbon disclosure publications allows us to provide useful policy implications for investors, policymakers and regulators. First, the premise of carbon disclosure should be able to meet the demands of different stakeholders, and there is a need for policymaking to penalize firms for falsifying carbon information. Secondly, there is a need to classify the degree to which firms disclose carbon information. This would allow investors to assess whether they will invest in firms with low, medium or high carbon disclosure. This will also eliminate the practices of greenwashing and impression management. It is evident from environmental literature that “high carbon disclosure” directly affects long-term financial performance. Thirdly, as more and more countries push for mandatory carbon disclosure, policymakers should introduce external verification processes for carbon information (currently, more than 70 % of firms report carbon information without external verification) and allow local regulators to undertake additional policy initiatives to monitor improvements in carbon information. Although the current study has provided an extensive contribution, we also identify certain limitations that future studies can overcome. First, most of the carbon information is self-reported; hence, generalizing such information must be cautiously inferred. To this end, we encourage researchers to examine data from indexes other than CDP, i.e., the MSCI world index and evaluate how carbon management practices and environmental policies affect firm risk profile to extend the academic discussion. Second, as more and more business corporations begin reporting of carbon data; so, given data availability, there is a need to evaluate how internal carbon fee and shadow pricing impact firms’ environmental and financial performances to ensure coherence with long-term policymaking. Thirdly, another new research area would be to examine whether or not proactive carbon policies lead to better risk management from an RBV perspective. Hence, there is a need to evaluate if carbon mitigation policies reduce market risks and are a cost burden for firms with limited financial resources. Lastly, greenwashing practices of corporations from developed to emerging economies are another research area with significant implications for environmental quality. Future research in this context would be helpful for policymakers, companies, and relevant stakeholders to align firm goals and objectives to achieve progress toward environmental targets.
