                  Recently, sustainable development has been a global requirement due to environmental instability worldwide that has attracted much attention from scholars and policymakers. Thus, the current article objectives are to examine the influence of green finance and renewable energy sources (solar power, bioenergy, hydropower, and wind power) over sustainable development in China. The secondary data were extracted from the databases of the Global Green Finance Index (GGFI), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and World Development Indicators (WDI) from 1986 to 2019. The authors checked the unit root through Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, and verified the associations among the constructs with the autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL). The results indicate that green finance and renewable energy sources have a positive association with sustainable development, and a negative association with carbon emissions in China. This study helps policymakers in developing policies related to sustainable development in the country using green finance.

Recently, sustainable development has been a global requirement due to environmental instability worldwide that has attracted much attention from scholars and policymakers. Thus, the current article objectives are to examine the influence of green finance and renewable energy sources (solar power, bioenergy, hydropower, and wind power) over sustainable development in China. The secondary data were extracted from the databases of the Global Green Finance Index (GGFI), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and World Development Indicators (WDI) from 1986 to 2019. The authors checked the unit root through Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, and verified the associations among the constructs with the autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL). The results indicate that green finance and renewable energy sources have a positive association with sustainable development, and a negative association with carbon emissions in China. This study helps policymakers in developing policies related to sustainable development in the country using green finance.   Keywords Green finance  Renewable energy sources  Solar power  Bioenergy  Wind power  Sustainable development  Carbon emissions    1 Introduction Extensive economic activities have been executed by the Chinese economy that needs a high level of energy sources that create a high level of carbon emission. In this situation, renewable energy sources are not enough to fulfill the demand for Chinese economic activities. There is a significant need to develop and implement policies regarding the extensive use of renewable energy to reduce environmental degradation while executing a high level of economic activities. Thus, the prime aim of the article is to sort out the renewable energy source that has a greater impact on reducing carbon emission, and for this purpose, the article examines the different renewable energy sources' impact on carbon emission and the results. The study findings will bring an effective renewable energy source that reduces carbon emission more efficiently than the others. This phenomenon motivates the researchers and examines the different sources of renewable energy sources' impact on CO2 emissions. A clean environment safeguards our existence and peaceful lives, as well as the active performance of daily functions. From an economic point of view, a healthy environment ensures a healthy and sustainable economy Khan et al. (2021a) ; Phuc Nguyen, Schinckus, and Dou et al. (2020) . There is a reciprocal relationship between economy and environment. When the environment pollution-free and healthy, the economy will progress rapidly and sustainably, for the good environment provides a healthy labor force capable of performing business activities efficiently. Besides, the good environment assures the availability of high-quality natural resources, which guarantee the performance of present and future economic processes Eyuboglu and Uzar (2020) ; Khan et al. (2021b) . In return, the economy affects environmental quality and health through policies, strategies, and circumstances. The environmental quality is affected by economic processes like transportation, electricity production, industrial activities, and resource/technology application, particularly the energy resources produced and consumed in the economic sector. This is because the utilization of energy resources contributes the greatest to the emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that leads to climate change Khan et al. (2020a) ; Sulaiman and Abdul-Rahim (2018) . Fossil fuels, such as natural gas, coal, oil, and ore, emit more carbon dioxide than other energy sources. The promotion of green finance and renewable energy production promises a change to carbon emissions and economic development. Green finance is the focus of green concerns in the financial policies and activities that promote clean energy resources. As its name suggests, renewable energy is produced from renewable, clean, and sustainable energy resources, which have minimum negative environmental impacts and support sustain economic growth Bhattacharya et al. (2017) ; Ma et al. (2021) ; Pans et al. (2021) ; Turfboer and Silvius (2021) . This study focuses on the sustainable development of China, where the carbon dioxide emissions increase with the passage of time (Fig. 1  ). The focus of the current study lies in the influence of the Global Green Finance Index (GGFI), as well as renewable energy resources like solar power, bioenergy, hydropower, and wind power on carbon emissions Chien et al. (2021) ; Khan et al. (2020b)  and sustainable development in China, one of the largest countries by landmass and population with an upper-middle-income economy Canh et al. (2021) ; Khan et al. (2020b) ; Penghao et al. (2019) . China is a newly industrialized developing country, the second largest country by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), and the largest economy in terms of purchasing par parity D. Zhang, Zhang, and Managi (2019) . The GDP of China reached $16.642 trillion in 2021, growing at a rate of 8.5%. The three main sectors of the economy are agriculture, industry, and service, which contribute to 7.9%, 40.6% and 51.6% of the country's GDP, respectively. The enterprises engaged in agriculture do not have many impacts on environmental quality, but help to improve the air quality. By contrast, the firms involved in industrial and service sectors emit a large amount of greenhouse gases, due to the growing use of resources, energy, technology, as well as the application of business techniques that negatively affect the natural climate. In 2021, China's population stood at a staggering level of 1,443,995,000. The rapidly increasing population and the exponential growth of economy are primary causes of pollutants like carbon dioxide. An expanding population release more carbon dioxide into the air consistently through the respiration process, and the production and transportation activities (Josaiman et al., 2021 ). China emits more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide than any other country in the world. As a result, many researchers, regulators, and governments take China as the most responsible for climate change. However, the matter is not as clear as plain glass. There is the need to turn the coin upside down and find the reality. Many observers hold that China is the culprit of the worsening environment of the Earth Li et al. (2021) . The country witnesses the fastest spread of pollution across the globe. Since 2008, this country has been at the top of the list of global greenhouse gas emitters. China emits 7.10 tons of carbon dioxide per person, ranking 48th in the world. In this respect, China falls far behind the United States, which emits about double the amount of per capita carbon dioxide (16 tons) Yang et al. (2021) . China ranks the 14th in terms of carbon emitters Zhou et al. (2020) . As per environment-related figures of 2019, China released 10.21 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, twice that of the United States (5.30 billion metric tons). In other words, China emits 28% of global carbon dioxide. Overall, this country is the highest in greenhouse gas emissions around the world Fatima et al. (2021) ; Rahtikawatie et al. (2021) ; Stump and Wolfe (2021) ; Susilawati et al. (2021) . Carbon emissions in China increase over time, owing to the increase of population, technology application, and energy consumption Dou et al. (2021) . The huge amount of carbon emissions presents a serious threat to economic sustainability, and the social life within the country, because the growing emissions affect the quantity and quality of human resources, living creatures, and physical natural resources. All these factors are critical to the consistent performance of economic activities Abban and Hongxing (2021) . As a result, this study tries to find the ways to mitigate carbon emissions by analyzing the influence of GGFI and various renewable energy resources over carbon emissions and sustainable development. The study effectively narrows several significant research gaps: (Razuni et al., 2021 ); Waśko (2021)  (Wirsbinna and Grega, 2021 ; Zhuo and Salleh, 2021 ); (1) The influence of renewable energy resources on carbon emissions and sustainable development has long been a hot topic. But most researchers considered renewable energy resources as a complete impactor of carbon emissions and sustainable development. Some only addressed one or two dimensions of renewable energy resources, while examining carbon emissions and sustainable development. To make up for the gap, this study analyzes the influence of multiple renewable energy resources on Carbon emissions and sustainable development. (2) The influence of GGFI and that of renewable energy resources on carbon emissions and sustainable development have only been tackled separately in previous research. Our study analyzes the two factors simultaneously as determinants of carbon emissions. (3) Our study also innovatively examines China's climate and economy to determine the impacts of GGFI and renewable energy resources on carbon emissions and sustainable development. This paper is structured in the following manner: Part 2 reviews the arguments on the influence of GGFI and renewable energy resources on carbon emissions and sustainable development. Part 3 describes the data collection and analysis processes, which ensure the suitability of results, and compares the results with the findings of the previous studies. Finally, the implications, conclusions, and limitations were presented after a thorough discussion. 1.1 Literature review Economic activities like transportation, production, manufacturing, and electricity production are the major source of carbon emissions. This is mainly because lots of fossil fuels are combusted in these activities, releasing carbon dioxide to the air (Baloch et al., 2019 ). Fortunately, green practices like green finance and renewable energy resources promise changes to the use of nonrenewable energy resources, and could reshape the influence of economic activities on environmental and natural resources. For example, a change in the energy consumption pattern or the environmental impacts of economic activities will affect the sustainability in economic growth Chishti et al. (2021) . Drawing on the literature on the relationship among the aforementioned factors, this study examines the influence of GGFI and renewable energy resources on carbon emissions and sustainable development in China. Green finance integrates green concepts into finance. It refers to the formulation and implementation of financial policies in such a way that leads to better environmental outcomes. Green finance includes the issuance of green credit, green securities, and green investment, which promote environmentally friendly projects for social welfare, human survival, and sustainable development of the economy (Yao and Tang, 2021 ). Green finance may be applied to promote the development of energy-efficient technology, the energy-efficient utilization of resources, the transition to clean energy consumption, the implementation of eco-friendly business processes, and the reduction of hazardous wastes by economic enterprises. If financial institutions provide green finance extensively, it will be possible to control the creation of environmental pollutant like carbon dioxide Lv and Li et al. (2021) . B. Zhang and Wang (2021)  investigated the influence of green finance on energy efficiency and carbon emissions, and discovered that many financial institutions set aside a specific amount of money to grant loans for green activities on easy conditions and low interest rates. Then, the business firms in the economy can raise funds by taking green loans, and rely on the funds to change energy consumption pattern, transform typical technology to energy-efficient technology, and improve the energy efficiency of business processes. The decreased use of unclean energy resources, and the application of clean energy resources, suppress the carbon emissions of the firm. B. Zhang and Wang (2021) , used only the green finance and ignored the other factors of renewable energy sources and suggested that future articles should also add renewable energy to predict the CO2 emission. Ren, Shao, and Zhong (2020)  analyzed the impact of green finance development index, which covers such four dimensions as green insurance, green securities, green credit, and green investment, on carbon emissions and sustainable development, using data on China's green finance industry in 2000–2018. Their results show a negative relation between green finance and carbon emissions, but a positive relation between green finance and sustainable development and also ignored the renewable energy sources role on CO2 emission and recommended that the upcoming article should also include the renewable energy to predict the CO2 emission. Solar power is a source of renewable energy. With the rising energy demand and growing carbon emissions, solar power panels become a popular source of energy, as they provide additional, clean and never-ending energy at lower costs Liu et al. (2019) . Solar power is being utilized to replace fossil fuels, which are the major source of carbon emissions. In solar power systems, the panels absorb heat from the atmosphere, and thus weakens the greenhouse gas effect induced by the rising carbon emissions Wu et al. (2018) . The solar power storage system attached to the main solar panel system stores the excessive solar energy for future use, and reduced the use of nonrenewable energy in future. Razmjoo, Sumper, and Davarpanah (2019)  investigated the influence of reliable renewable energy resources on energy sustainability and carbon emissions but failed to add a green finance role on the carbon emission that is the financial source for the renewable energy, and the current article has taken this aspect in the study. After reviewing every environmental concern, these renowned scholars acquired data from the meteorological organization, and conducted a techno-economic assessment on HOMER, taking solar power and wind power as reliable renewable energy resources. This empirical investigation concludes that the installation of solar power plants to get electric power from sunshine presents a renewable energy resource, which reduces air pollution by minimizing the carbon emissions, and helps preserve energy for sustainable use in the economy. In addition, Bhatia et al. (2019)  suggested that bioenergy is now a popular source of energy among business organizations, as it has minimal or no adverse impact on the natural environment. Bioenergy is produced through the consumption of natural resources like biofuel or biomass. These natural resources are utilized to gather energy to be used in household chores and commercial activities, but this process does not adversely affect the natural resource quality. Rather, it is a helpful way to reduce environmental pollution, and create economic sustainability, by controlling carbon emissions Schulze et al. (2020) . Koondhar et al. (2021)  explored the influence of bioenergy consumption on carbon emissions and agricultural bio-economic growth, against the time series data on Chinese economy in 1971–2019. They ignored the other renewable energy sources and especially green finance that provide the financial assistance to bring the renewable energy in the processes, and the present study has taken all of these factors in the study. The data were analyzed by an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound testing model, and a novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (DYNARDL) simulation model. The study implies that bioenergy from biomass is based on organic materials (e.g., woods, crops, and crop wastes), which absorbs heat and carbon dioxide from the air, and the energy can be reserved for future use in the economy. Thus, bioenergy has a positive influence on bio-economic growth, and a negative influence on carbon emissions. Bauer et al. (2020)  checked the influence of bioenergy on carbon emissions and sustainable economic development, highlighting that a country tends to fuel business technologies and processes with bioenergy to the largest possible extent, with the aim to minimize carbon emissions. Bioenergy can be attained from trees, food crops, and non-food crops, as well as crop wastes. Bioenergy resources are produced with the carbon dioxide from the air. The production process not only reduces wastes, but also minimizes the emission of harmful gases like carbon dioxide to the air. Thus, bioenergy production ensures the abundance of natural resources for use in economic processes.(Naveed et al., 2021 ). Renewable energy resources are considered the clean and sustainable sources of energy, because they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save energy for future use, and guarantee sustainable economic development. The hydropower is a renewable energy resource, which produces electricity using water to propel electric turbines Mousavi et al. (2017) . Both the consumption and production of hydropower energy protect the environment from carbon emissions, and assure energy availability for future use Kusumadewi et al. (2017) . Bello, Solarin, and Yen (2018)  analyzed the impacts of hydropower consumption on the environment for the emerging economy of Malaysia from 1971 to 2016. They also ignored the other renewable energy sources that have a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions and also ignored green finance, which provides the financial assistance to bring the renewable energy into the processes, and the present study has taken all of these factors into the study. Four indices of environmental degradation, including carbon footprint, water footprint, ecological footprint, and carbon emissions, were designed to evaluate GDP sustainability. The ARDL bounds testing cointegration approach and the vector error correction model (VECM) Granger causality approaches were applied to examine the long-term causal dynamics between the constructs. This study reveals that hydropower consumption in the economic processes reduces the use of fossil fuels, curbs the air, water, and land pollution, and protects all living creatures. The energy preserved and natural resource protected by hydropower consumption ensures the sustainability of GDP growth. Hence, hydropower electricity inhibits carbon footprint, water footprint, ecological footprint, and carbon emissions, while promoting sustainable GDP. Wind power is another renewable energy source of electricity. Like other renewable energy resources, wind power is an ecological friendly source of energy. By virtue of its greenness, wind power is gaining popularity among manufacturing enterprises, transportation firms, agriculture practitioners, and service providers. The consumption and production of wind energy reduce carbon emissions in the region, and save the energy and other resources for use in future economic activities González-Aparicio et al. (2017) . Many business organizations employ wind energy to perform the maximum number of tasks. This practice reduces the reliance on fossil fuel consumption, and minimizes the production of harmful substances, toxic gases, and smoke-releasing wastes. The utilization of wind power mitigates the adverse environmental impacts of economic activities, and protects various natural resources, providing a guarantee to smooth economic performance McKenna et al. (2017) . To verify the effectiveness of substituting coal-fired power with wind power effectiveness of substituting coal-fired power with wind power for China's carbon reduction goals in 2020 and 2030, Zhao et al. (2017)  carried out life cycle assessment (LCA) to check the influence of wind power and coal-fired power on carbon emissions, and concluded that the carbon emissions from the selected wind farm and coal-fired plant in China were 12.5 g/kWh and 810.4 g/kWh, respectively. Hence, wind power has a negative impact on carbon emissions. Lin and Chen (2018)  investigated the carbon abatement effect of wind power plants, revealing that the wind power is the most cost-effective source of energy to fight against carbon emissions. Some of the article presented in Table 1  .   2 Methodology The study examines the influence of green finance and renewable energy sources, such as solar power, bioenergy, hydropower, and wind power, on sustainable development in China. Although it is scientifically proven that renewable energy sources reduce carbon emission, but the current article's purpose is to examine the individual renewable energy sources' impact on the CO2 emission. Which of renewable energy source has a greater impact on the CO2 emission that would use more than the others to reduce CO2 emissions. The secondary data were extracted the Global Green Finance Index (GGFI), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and World Development Indicators (WDI) from 1986 to 2019. The current article has used the social representations theory that explains how individuals, communities, and groups collectively make sense of socially relevant issues. By using this theory, the companies should be socially responsible for reducing the issue of high carbon emissions by self-using measures like the use of renewable energy sources. In the light of social representations theory, the current article also examines the different energy sources and green finance to reduce carbon emissions and comply with their social responsibility for environmental protection. Based on this theory, the research can be expressed as:(1) C O 2 t  =  α 0  +  β 1  G G F I t  +  β 2  S P R t  +  β 3  B E R t  +  β 4  H P R t  + β 5  W P R t  + e t      where, CO2  is carbon emissions; t  is time period; GGFI is global green finance index; SPR is solar power; BER is bioenergy; HPR is hydropower; WPR is wind power. The current article only focuses on SDG 13 about the climate action and sustainable development goals about the climate action was taken as the dependent variable and measured as the carbon dioxide damage (% of GNI). Green finance and renewable energy resources were used as independent variables. The former was measured with GGFI, while the latter was decomposed into four dimensions: solar power was measured as the ratio of investment on solar power projects to total renewable energy investment, bioenergy was measured as the ratio of investment on bioenergy projects to total renewable energy investment, hydropower was measured as the ratio of investment on hydropower projects to total renewable energy investment, and wind power was measured as the ratio of investment on wind power projects to total renewable energy investment. Table 2   shows these measurements. Through descriptive statistical analysis, the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of all constructs were calculated. The correlation matrix was adopted to test the multicollinearity among predictors. Moreover, stationarity was verified through the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test:(2) d ( Y t  )  = α 0  +  β t +  Υ Y t − 1     +  d ( Y t  ( − 1  )  )  +  ε t       The stationarity was tested by individual constructs: Carbon emissions(3) d ( C O 2 t  )  = α 0  +  β t +  Υ C O 2 t − 1     +  d ( C O 2 t  ( − 1  )  )  + ε t       GGFI(4) d ( G G F I t  )  = α 0  +  β t +  Υ G G F I t − 1     +  d ( G G F I t  ( − 1  )  )  +  ε t       Solar power(5) d ( S P R t  )  = α 0  +  β t +  Υ S P R t − 1     +  d ( S P R t  ( − 1  )  )  +  ε t       Bioenergy(6) d ( B E R t  )  = α 0  +  β t +  Υ B E R t − 1     +  d ( B E R t  ( − 1  )  )  +  ε t       Hydropower(7) d ( H P R t  )  = α 0  +  β t +  Υ H P R t − 1     +  d ( H P R t  ( − 1  )  )  + ε t       Wind power(8) d ( W P R t  )  = α 0  +  β t +  Υ W P R t − 1     +  d ( W P R t  ( − 1  )  )  +  ε t       In addition, an ARDL was employed to examine the long-term associations among the constructs. The application of ARDL depends on stationarity: the ideal application effect can only be achieved when some constructs are stationary at a certain level, and some of them must be at first difference. Fit for small sample data, ARDL is the best technique to examine the integrations of constructs Osabohien et al. (2018) . That is why this article relies on ARDL to investigate the long-term impact of green finance and renewable energy sources on sustainable development. The ARDL equation can be expressed as:(9) Δ C O 2 t  = α 0  +  ∑ δ 1  Δ C O 2 t − 1    +  ∑ δ 2  Δ G G F I t − 1   +  ∑ δ 3  Δ S P R t − 1   +  ∑ δ 4  Δ B E R t − 1   + ∑ δ 5  Δ H P R t − 1   + ∑ δ 6  Δ W P R t − 1   + φ 1  C O 2 t − 1    +  φ 2  G G F I t − 1   +  φ 3  S P R t − 1   +  φ 4  B E R t − 1   + φ 5  H P R t − 1   + φ 6  W P R t − 1   +  ε 1      where, δ1 , δ2 , δ3 , δ4 , and δ5  are the coefficients for short-term associations among variables; φ1 , φ   2 , φ3 , φ4 , φ5 , and Ɛ1  are the coefficients for long-term associations among variables, and the error term, respectively. In addition, the error correction model (ECM) was employed to check the short-term associations:(10) Δ C O 2 t  = α 0  +  ∑ δ 1  Δ C O 2 t − 1    +  ∑ φ 2  Δ G G F I t − 1   +  ∑ ω 3  Δ S P R t − 1   +  ∑ θ 4  Δ B E R t − 1   + ∑ Υ 5  Δ H P R t − 1   + ∑ ¥ 6  Δ W P R t − 1   + δ E C M t  +  υ t        3 Results In the preceding section, the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of all constructs were calculated through descriptive statistical analysis. The results (Table 3  ) show that the mean of carbon emissions, GGFI, SPR, BER, HPR, and WPR was 5.920, 95.294, 0.287, 0.225, 0.265, and 0.251, respectively. Besides, the correlation matrix was adopted to test the multicollinearity among predictors. The results (Table 4  ) indicate no multicollinearity issue exists, and all predictors are negatively correlated with carbon emissions in China. For each unit of increase in GGFI, the carbon emissions will drop by 0.581 units, and vice versa. For each unit increase in SPR, the carbon emissions will drop by 0.435 units, and vice versa. For each unit increase in BER, the carbon emissions will drop by 0.539 units and vice versa. For each unit increase in HPR, the carbon emissions will drop by 0.493 units, and vice versa. For each unit increase in WPR, the carbon emissions will drop by 0.651 units, and vice versa. Moreover, stationarity was examined through the ADF test. The results (Table 5  ) show that SPR and WPR are stationary at a level, while carbon emissions, GGFI, BER and HPR are stationary at first difference. The results verify the suitability of the ARDL approach. In addition, the co-integration among the constructs, an essential assumption for the application of ARDL, was verified through an ARDL bound test. The test results (Table 6  ) show that the F-statistics (5.18) were greater than the critical values at 5% and 10% significance levels. This means the ARDL model is fit for this research. As shown in Table 7  , in the short term, green finance and renewable energy sources have a positive association with sustainable development, and a negative association with carbon emissions in China. For each unit of increase in GGFI, the carbon emissions will decrease by 0.426 units, and vice versa. For each unit of increase in SPR, the carbon emissions will decrease by 0.678 units, and vice versa. For each unit of increase in BER, the carbon emissions will decrease by 8.806 units, and vice versa. For each unit of increase in HPR, the carbon emissions will decrease by 0.199 units, and vice versa. For each unit of increase in WPR, the carbon emissions will decrease by 0.428 units, and vice versa. In addition, 52.6% of the variance in carbon emissions is attributable to the predictors. As shown in Table 8  , in the long term, green finance and renewable energy sources have a positive association with sustainable development, and a negative association with carbon emissions in China. For each unit of increase in GGFI, the carbon emissions will decrease by 0.798 units, and vice versa. For each unit of increase in SPR, the carbon emissions will decrease by 2.782 units, and vice versa. For each unit of increase in BER, the carbon emissions will decrease by 0.295 units, and vice versa. For each unit of increase in HPR, the carbon emissions will decrease by 2.782 units, and vice versa. For each unit of increase in WPR, the carbon emissions will decrease by 1.592 units, and vice versa.  4 Discussions The study results indicate that GGFI has a negative impact on carbon emissions. When financial institutions consider green concepts in the formulating and implementation of green finance policies, it is possible to apply a clean source of energy, and minimize the carbon emissions into the air. The Chinese economy has significant policies related to green finance in producing and using renewable energy sources, which is the reason for the negative association between green finance and carbon emission. In this way, the environment will be cleaners, and economic sustainability will be a possibility. These results are supported by Zhou et al. (2020) , who stated that green finance instruments, such as green credit and green investment, encourage clean energy sources and environmentally friendly programs, and thereby reduce carbon emissions across the country. These sources and programs save lots of high-quality natural resources, and ensure the sustainable development of the country. Our results are also in line with Abbas et al. (2021) , who demonstrated that green finance enhances the potential of the business organizations to switch from nonrenewable or unclean energy sources to renewable or clean energy resources, cuts down on carbon emissions, and protects resources for future use within the economy. The study results also manifest that solar power has a negative impact on carbon emissions, which is an obstacle of sustainable economic development. The Chinese economy has invested in the solar power system and developed effective policies to reduce carbon emission using solar energy, which is the reason for the negative association between solar power energy and carbon emission. This finding agrees with the results of Sharifzadeh et al. (2019) : it is possible to use less fossil fuels, reduce carbon emissions, and promote economic sustainability by installing solar power panels that attain the energy to run high voltage power electric appliances or technologies in various business organizations. The finding is also consistent with the opinions of Motevali and Koloor (2017) : solar power, a renewable source of energy, is based on the heat from the sun; it involves no harmful substances or processes, and leaves no toxic wastes; the application of solar panels can reduce the carbon emissions of business activities, and save natural resources for the future of the economy. The study results imply that bioenergy has a negative impact on carbon emissions, which restricts sustainable economic development. The effective policies related to bioenergy production and usage developed by China to reduce carbon emission that is the reason of the negative association among bioenergy and carbon emission. This result matches with the idea of Mandova et al. (2019) : the consumption of bioenergy resources provides fuel to various business processes (e.g., manufacturing, transportation, and infrastructure), and creates a safe work environment to organizational employees, because it does not release any carbon dioxide or other harmful substances into the air; bioenergy consumption also ensures a healthy labor force, necessary for the consistent performance of the firms. Our result is also in line with Pour et al. (2017) , who highlighted that, if business firms prefer to use bioenergy to fuel the production of goods and services, fewer carbon dioxide will be released into the air, and the existing carbon dioxide in the air will be absorbed by bioenergy resources like food or non-food crops; Thus, he utilization of bioenergy will not undermine the quality of natural resources, and the health or skills of human resources, but will guarantee the sustainable development of the country. The study results suggest that hydropower has a negative impact on carbon emissions, which hinders sustainable economic development. The Chinese economy also has an investment in the hydropower system and has developed effective policies to reduce carbon emissions using hydropower energy, which is the reason for the negative association among hydropower energy and carbon emission. This result echoes with the finding of Pao and Chen (2019) : the consumption of hydropower provides a clean substitute to nonrenewable energy like fossil fuels, which are the largest carbon emitter; hydropower is produced by driving turbines with water waves, without needing any coal, oil, or gas; during the electricity generation, no carbon dioxide will be released into the air, and the natural resources are saved for future use. Asif, Gao, Lv, Xi, and Dong (2018)  also provided a similar result: the production and consumption of hydropower is an effective way to suppress greenhouse gas emissions, because no unclean energy resource is needed to produce electricity or implement economic processes. The study results show that wind power has a negative impact on carbon emissions. The effective policies related to wind power production and usage developed by China to reduce carbon emission that is the reason for the negative association among wind power and carbon emission. This is in line with the result of Shamsi et al. (2019) : energy is critical to the performance of most economic activities, but traditional energy sources, such as fossil fuels, damage the environment and natural resources in the form of carbon emissions; wind power production solves the environmental problems by releasing no harmful gases or toxic materials, and contributes to the sustainability in the economic development. 4.1 Study implications This study has considerable theoretical importance for its major contributions to the literature on green development. The current article has provided a contribution to the existing literature on green finance and CO2 emission. In addition, the current article contributes to the literature on different renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, bioenergy, and hydropower's role in carbon emission. In addition, it is one of the first attempts that green finance and renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, bioenergy, and hydropower are collectively used to predict carbon emissions. Moreover, the current article also contributes to the literature of social representations theory. Specifically, the authors deliberated on the role of green finance and renewable energy resources in achieving sustainable development through clean energy, and explored the effects of GGFI and various renewable energy resources on carbon emissions and sustainable development. Our study, which treats green finance and renewable energy resources as predictors of carbon emissions and sustainable development all at once, is a great contribution to the literature. What is more, few studies have been conducted to reveal the impacts of green finance on sustainable development of Chinese economy, while our study marks the first attempt to clarify these impacts. This study also has a great empirical significance to the economy of China and many other emerging economies. The research deals with the hot issue of carbon emissions, a hurdle in sustainable economic development. Environmental regulators and economists can draw inspiration from this study to formulate control policies for carbon emissions, and incentive policies for sustainable development. The current article guides the policymakers about the development of policies related to the investment in green finance that reduces carbon emissions. The study also helps the relevant authorities in selecting the more effective renewable energy sources in reducing carbon emissions. The article also helps the new studies in investigating this area in the future.   5 Conclusions and limitations The study concluded that green finance and renewable energy resources are effective enough in the Chinese economy in controlling carbon emissions and attaining the sustainable development goal of clean energy. The authors quantitatively analyzed the influence of GGFI and multiple renewable energy resources, including solar power, bioenergy, hydropower, and wind power, over carbon emissions and sustainable development in China. The results show that GGFI and the renewable energy resources are negatively correlated with carbon emissions. The growth in global green finance raises funds for business units, enabling them to eliminate the negative environmental impacts of business activities, and to reduce carbon emissions. Besides, running electric appliances on solar power in firms reduces the use of traditional energy sources, thereby reducing the emissions of harmful gases like carbon dioxide. Similarly, bioenergy is an effective way to ensure the sustainability in economic activities, as it preserves the natural resources and human capital for future use by reducing carbon emissions. It was also demonstrated that the production and consumption of hydropower and wind power involve no hazardous material, and thus emit no carbon dioxide, and sustain the economic development. This study still has some limitations, which need to be removed in future. For example, this study analyzes the influence of only green finance and renewable energy resources on carbon emissions and, thus, on sustainable economic development. Nevertheless, many other possible influencing factors were not taken into account, such as government policies, the potential of environmental regulatory authorities, and research and development. More research efforts are required to investigate how these factors influence carbon emissions. Moreover, this study only investigates the situation in China. A single country may not be enough to provide reliable and valid data. In future, multiple economies will be analyzed to improve the research reliability.
