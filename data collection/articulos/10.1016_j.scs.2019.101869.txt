                  The UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 169 targets have been considered in multidisciplinary approaches worldwide. Whereas, several environmental, economic and social development concerns have been covered by the UN 2030 Agenda. The aim of this research is to investigate the complexity of the interactions between building materials and the SDGs, in an attempt to establish a knowledge-based decision support system for policy-makers, designers and construction stakeholders regarding the implementation of 2030 agenda. A conceptual framework based on a systematic and comprehensive literature review, coupled with critical content analysis, was developed. This research proved that building materials can contribute significantly to the achievement of 13 goals and 25 targets of SDGs. The framework showed that direct positive contribution of building materials on the SDGs has been noticed in SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 15 while invisible contribution has been shown in SDG 2, SDG 5, SDG 10 and SDG 16. Additionally, indirect and negative contributions have been presented entirely in the framework. The present study offered a possibility to motivate future research and further critical discussions on the topic.

The UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 169 targets have been considered in multidisciplinary approaches worldwide. Whereas, several environmental, economic and social development concerns have been covered by the UN 2030 Agenda. The aim of this research is to investigate the complexity of the interactions between building materials and the SDGs, in an attempt to establish a knowledge-based decision support system for policy-makers, designers and construction stakeholders regarding the implementation of 2030 agenda. A conceptual framework based on a systematic and comprehensive literature review, coupled with critical content analysis, was developed. This research proved that building materials can contribute significantly to the achievement of 13 goals and 25 targets of SDGs. The framework showed that direct positive contribution of building materials on the SDGs has been noticed in SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 15 while invisible contribution has been shown in SDG 2, SDG 5, SDG 10 and SDG 16. Additionally, indirect and negative contributions have been presented entirely in the framework. The present study offered a possibility to motivate future research and further critical discussions on the topic.   Keywords Building materials  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Contribution  Interaction  Building construction  Built-environment    1 Introduction In September 2015, the United Nations general assembly (Leaders from 193 countries of the world) adopted seventeenth sustainable development goals as an action plan to transform the world (people, planet and prosperity) by the year 2030 (United Nation-UN, 2015 ). Several environmental, economic and social development concerns, such as health and well-being, poverty, hunger, quality education, gender equality, climate action, water, sanitation, energy and environment and peace and social justice have been covered by the UN 2030 Agenda (McArthur & Rasmussen, 2018 ). The new 17 SDGs and the 169 associated targets are linked to the previous three pillars of sustainable development: the economic, social and the environment in an attempt to encourage action over the next years to transform Earth for a sustainable planet. The 2030 Agenda has been motivated from the following reports: Brundtland report (WCED, 1987 ), the UN conference on environment and development (United Nation-UN, 1992 ), the Millennium Declaration (United Nation-UN, 2000 ), and the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (United Nation-UN, 2012 ) (see Appendix A Supplementary data). The 17 SDGs have been presented as separate goals, but they are interrelated to each other systematically (Harris, Riley, Dawson, Friel, & Lawson, 2018 ; Russell, Lee, & Clift, 2018 ), and they can affect each other positively or negatively (Pradhan, 2019 ; Singh et al., 2018 ). The research related to SDGs significantly appeared in various disciplines in the academic domain. The SDGs have become a challenge for all countries as the achievement of these goals and targets requires the establishment of an advanced and determined system at a country level, thus it will increase the demand for technology, innovation and resources to build such system (Bebbington & Unerman, 2015 ). However, governments and their related bodies have the major responsibility to initiate rules and regulations and also to follow-up and review the implementation of these goals at local, regional, national and global levels (Yin, Li, & Xing, 2019 ). The various goals and targets will be associated with a different degree of challenge for different countries depending on the existing development condition, for instance, the country’s economic and urbanization growth are determined its ability to achieve SDGs and to move towards sustainability (Osborn, Cutter, & Ullah, 2015 ). The World Business Council for Sustainable Development WBCSD, and DNV GL (2018)  have conducted a universal survey to investigate how companies are now working to incorporate their activities with the SDGs. The responses were obtained from around 250 companies across 43 countries and four continents. The results of the survey showed that, the SDG 13 (climate action) is the most ranked goal among others, with 62% companies classifying it as an important task, while the SDG 14 (Life below Water) achieved the least rank (only 10% of companies seeing it as a major topic). The responsible consumption and production goal (SDG 12) scored the highest percentage in Europe and Asia Pacific regions whereas in north Latin America the SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) was the highest rank. More Recently, Globescan (2017)  and Moratis and Melissen (2019)  claimed that it has been more than three years (20% of the time passed) since the United Nations (UN) General Assembly announced the 17 indivisible SDGs, however, a lot of work is needed to realize the agenda in the rest of the coming years. According to Nilsson, Griggs, and Visbeck (2016) , the overlapping between different SDGs can make perverse outcome if countries ignored its significance and started to implement the targets one by one. Moreover, the universal nature of the SDGs and the interactions between the goals and targets need to be considered by policymakers within different fields, thus a systematic framework has to be proposed in order to analyze the interactions between all sustainable development goals and indicators (Pradhan, Costa, Rybski, Lucht, & Kropp, 2017 ). The Understanding of the trade-off and the synergistic relationships between different SDGs is very essential in order to achieve enduring sustainable development results. Thus, a wide range of tools and analysis is needed to analyze the complexity and to achieve the goals in the rest of the years until 2030 (Nilsson, Griggs, Visbeck, & Ringler, 2017 ). Until now, there is nascent literature, addressing the interactions between the SDGs and their targets. For example, Coopman, Osborn, Ullah, Auckland, and Long (2016)  identified a new methodology to understand the interlinkages nature of the SDGs in developed countries, focusing on the interlinkages between the targets of the SDG 12 (ensuring sustainable consumption and production) and the other targets of SDGs. However, eight types of interlinkages and three categories (Supporting, Enabling and Relying) have been created for the evaluation and scoring of the interactions between SDGs and their targets. In June 2016, the International Council for Science (ICSU) and Nilsson, Griggs, Visbeck, and Ringler (2016)  have developed a framework for understanding the interactions between SDGs. Seven points have been presented in an ordinal scale helping in classification the nature of the interactions between SDGs and targets. The framework provides a wide range scale (from +3 to -3) to classify the most relationship between SDGs and their targets. Moreover, negative and positive interactions can be seen in the matrix. The positive interactions are given scores of either +3 (Invisible), +2 (reinforcing), or +1 (enabling), while the negative interactions and trade-off are scored with -3 (cancelling), -2 (counteracting), and -1 (constraining). Also, a score of 0 (consistent) is assigned if there are no negative or positive interactions between the SDGs or their targets (see Appendix A. Supplementary data). Furthermore, Waage et al. (2015)  proposed a framework for examining the interactions between SDGs and how those interactions can be directed. The framework composed of three concentric layers in a circle to show the relationships between the 17 SDGs. However, the well-being, infrastructure, and natural environment have been introduced in the inner layer, second-level, and third-level respectively. Each goal has been assigned to a specific level in order to link the health and well-being with other goals On the other hand, the expected growth of urbanization and large cities in the coming decades will be associated with significant production of raw materials and consumption of natural resources and economic movements (Ribeiro & Gonçalves, 2019 ). Hence, this can cause serious environmental and social impacts, and indeed, will increase the need for green building materials for constructing new building and infrastructure to accommodate these expansions and to achieve the overall sustainable development. Currently, the link between building materials and the UN SDGs and their targets has not been excessively clarified; consequently, there is a lack of information and insight on this important topic. Furthermore, there is no existing framework that scores building materials on their contribution to the SDGs. Therefore, this article aims to create a conceptual framework to examine the complexity of the interconnections between building materials and the SDGs based on a wide-ranging literature review in an attempt to establish a starting base-knowledge to support policy-makers, designers and developers regarding the implementation of 2030 agenda in buildings. The research intends to answer the following two main questions:1 How building materials can make sustainable development goals (SDGs) a reality?  2 What are the alternative building materials to achieve long-lasting sustainability in our built environment?    In addition to that, this study expects to develop new approaches and proposals to improve material selection decisions in order to transform building, neighborhood, city, and region into more sustainable and livable environments. Subsequent to this introduction, the rest of the article has the following structure: Section 1.1  and Section 1.2  show briefly the link between the construction industry, building materials and sustainable development goals (SDGs). Section 2  concisely define the research methods used in this study. In Section 3 , the contribution score of building materials in the achievement of SDGs and its results are presented, afterwards, the main results are reviewed. Finally, in section 5, the conclusions of this study and the need for future research are explained. 1.1 The link between building, construction industry and sustainable development goals (SDGs) While they provide uncountable benefits to society and human being, buildings have a remarkable impact on health and the environment. The building sector is repeatedly consuming a large amount of energy and natural resources during buildings lifetime; the design, construction, operation and the maintenance of the building, hence they have a massive impact on the environment (Invidiata, Lavagna, & Ghisi, 2018 ). The building occupies more than 32% of the total global energy use (Zou, Wagle, & Alam, 2019 ). The environmental impact of the buildings and construction sector is massive, it accounts for the use of 40% of the natural resources extracted in industrialized countries, the consumption of 70% of the electrical power and 12% of potable water, and the production of 45–65% of the waste placed to landfills (Castro-Lacouture, Sefair, Flórez, & Medaglia, 2009 ; Franzoni, 2011 ; Pulselli, Simoncini, Pulselli, & Bastianoni, 2007 ). Additionally, they are responsible for a large amount of GHG emissions accounting for 30% used during the operation phase and an additional 18% produced during material utilization and transportation (Umar, Khamidi, & Tukur, 2016 ). This huge percentage has raised concerns over the effect of buildings in the built environment, and therefore the following question has to be answered: What are the best methods we need to tackle in order to minimize the negative impact of the buildings on our environment? The 17 SDGs are wide-ranging, from zero poverty and hunger to peace justice and strong institutions, however, there are other several goals in which building can have a significant contribution to achieve them. The construction industry can contribute widely to achieving the UN sustainable development goals. The industry uses a considerable amount of materials, energy, water, and natural resources. Consequently, many local and global challenges such as climate change, health and well-being are significantly affected by this industry (Alawneh, Mohamed Ghazali, Ali, & Asif, 2018 ; Hurlimann, Warren-Myers, & Browne, 2019 ). The construction industry plays a vital role in the economic growth, social progress and in offering effective environmental protection which are the three elements of sustainable development (Aysin, 2009 ). The world green building Council’s Dominika Czerwinska (WGBC, 2019 ) identified that green building can participate positively to meet sustainable development goals. The WGBC proposed a detailed of three infographics on their website to show how a green building can contribute to achieving nine of SDGs including SDG 3, SDG7, SDG8, SDG9, SDG11, SDG12, SDG13, SDG15 and SDG17 (As shown in Fig. 1  )  Up to date, a few works in the literature demonstrate the connection and interaction between building and SDGs. Although the majority of prior research has enlightened the interlinkages between the building and one or two of SDGs, each of them has explored only part of this complex relationship. However, they can be considered as the first step towards a more reflective understanding of the subject. For instance, Di Foggia (2018)  studied the link between energy-efficient measures in buildings (EEMs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs). The study linked the energy-efficient buildings to SDG goal no 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable) and SDG goal no 13 (Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts) aiming to enhance the EE of the building, reduce the energy consumption and improve the indoor comfort levels. The finding of his research indicated that the implementation of effective energy-efficient measures and strategies can lower the cost of the building, contribute to sustaining the principal objectives of the current climate and energy policies, and promote global environmental well-being. Also, the Bioregional (2018)  foundation created a practical guide for construction and property companies showing how the construction sector could achieve the SDGs. The study investigated all the 169 targets of the SDGs, and 56 of them have been identified to be the most important targets in which the building and construction sector can have a direct role to achieve them. In recent research, Alawneh et al. (2018)  proposed an index to evaluate the contribution of water and energy efficiency measures in green building to achieve UN SDGs. The finding of his research stated that the implementation of LEED v2.2 water efficiency credits and energy and atmosphere standards participated in achieving seven of SDGs in Jordan including SDG 6, SDG7, SDG8, SDG9, SDG12, SDG13, and SDG15. Opoku (2019)  examined the impact and the role of the sustainable built environment with regard to biodiversity conservation and the SDGs by investigating the link between all SDGs in general and SDG 15 in particular. The research revealed that the efficient and the responsible use of building materials has been identified as a major task where the built-environment can contribute significantly to preserve biodiversity and realize the SDGs.  1.2 Building materials and sustainable development goals (SDGs) Building materials can be referred to any material that is used for construction purposes, it can be naturally arising in nature such as clay, sand, and wood or it can be artificially made by human beings (synthetic materials) such as brick, insulation, metal and plastics (Kubba, 2017b ). Building Materials, belonging to over 2000 types of products and materials, commonly classified into two groups: metal materials and non-metal materials (Song et al., 2018 ). Materials have been considered an essential element for building construction as far back as 400 BC (Tuflite, 2016 ). The first building materials were biodegradable and nondurable (for example; Leaves and animal hides). Afterwards, with the industrial revolution followed by the development of machinery and large-scale industrial production, many innovative materials have been discovered for building construction (such as Metal and Concrete). Moreover, with the continuing research; various construction materials have been available in the market to satisfy the need of creating modern architectural designs (Silva, Khan, & Han, 2018 ). Nevertheless, the evolution in the building materials industry has been accompanying with many environmental problems related to climate change and global warming. Building materials have been becoming part of the sustainable development concept which is becoming an important task within the construction industry aiming to reduce the negative impact of the building on the environment (Martins & Gonçalves, 2012 ). The building materials generate million tons of waste annually resulting in a large carbon dioxide emissions in the built environment. As stated by Asif, Muneer, and Kelley (2007)  and Yahya and Boussabaine (2010) , globally, over 40% of the application of the materials is operating in the construction of buildings, including non-renewable materials. Building materials are responsible for 10%–20% of the building’s total energy consumption, from the first instance the percentages look relatively low, but by looking at the development of their production, these numbers will increase steadily in the next coming years (Ramesh, Prakash, & Shukla, 2014 ; Ruuska & Häkkinen, 2014 ). Building Materials dominate a great share in the total energy consumption of the building during it is life-cycle and they are contributing to the total GHG emissions (Hong, Shen, Feng, Lau, & Mao, 2015 ; Sabnis & Pranesh, 2017 ; Sagheb, Vafaeihosseini, & Kumar, 2011 ; Yüksek, 2015 ). These greenhouse gases emissions are related to the building’s operational energy (OE) as well as the embodied energy (EE) of the building materials (Ramesh, Prakash, & Shukla, 2010 ; Thormark, 2006 ). According to the data derived from the World Health Institute-WHO (2016) , building materials (like asbestos, formaldehyde, and lead) have the potential to damage health and causes serious diseases like cancer, lung disease and reduced growth (Petrović, Vale, Zari, & Petrović, 2017 ), and could create what is known as a sick building syndrome. However, if they selected well, materials can provide a better indoor environment for the human being and they can reduce the negative impacts of buildings on climate and health (Pedersen Zari, 2019 ). On the other hand, since 1987, numerous building materials and products have been introduced in the construction market to show their capability to meet the international sustainable development goal. As a result, several terminologies concerning the sustainability of building and material have been widely used without a clear definition (Berardi, 2013 ). For this reason, controversies and debates existed between researchers and many of them came up with different explanations (Ofori, Briffett, Gang, & Ranasinghe, 2000 ). In many cases, sustainable and green terms were used interchangeably (Kates, 2010 ), however sustainable building materials is a much broader term that fulfils more criteria and views than other terms (Sodiq et al., 2019 ). The demand for environmentally friendly and green building materials has increased dramatically over the past few years and it is expected to push the building materials industry and construction growth in the next coming years. In addition, the multifaceted nature of SDGs presents big opportunities for building material to reveal its significant impact on the realization of sustainable development. According to Secher, Collin, and Linnet (2018)  building materials have a significant impact (direct and indirect) on achieving a variety of goals and targets within sustainable development goals (SDGs), these goals include SDG3, SDG6, SDG7, SDG8, SDG9, SDG11, and SDG12. However, the link between building materials and SDGs remains briefly addressed in the literature, thus a more systematic and theoretical analysis is required to fill this gap, which contributes to further research.   2 Materials and methods As stated previously, the integral nature of the SDGs indicates that a large number of potential interactions have to be considered within the 17 goals and 169 targets of the sustainable development agenda. The proposed methodology is composed of the following five stages: i) extensive peer-reviewed studies were adopted from various online databases to define and categorize building materials, and to investigate the link between different categories of building materials and SDGs, ii) integrating and grouping sources that addressed important insights the study, iii) development of a contribution score, iv) applying the obtained scores to SDGs in a theoretical framework, v) refining and interpreting the results of the framework. In Fig. 2  , the methods used in this study are presented. In the procedure first stage, to obtain the relevant articles for review in this study; three comprehensive databases were used as major literature sources including Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Additionally, the Google search engine was used as a source of definition to specific terms related to this topic. Further, grey literature relevant to this study were used as an additional source of information. This includes conference proceedings, expert and government reports, websites, and policy documents. The terms: (Sustainable Development Goals; SDGs; UN agenda; 2030 Agenda) and (sustainable building materials; green building materials; contribution; interaction; building construction; built-environment) were used as search keywords. The immediate gain of this stage indicates the necessity of defining and selecting building material based on its surrounding environmental context. In other words, building materials should be identified and produced to maintain its performance with respect to variable context conditions at a particular location and time. Hence, defining terms categorize the range of building materials that could be adopted, with the overall aim of achieving sustainable development agenda (As shown in Table 1  ). In addition, sources not written in English, and documents classified in subject areas other than the one under study are excluded. The narrowed-down search resulted in 262 peer-reviewed journal articles. In the second stage, after obtaining all the publications for the review, the process was continued by reading the keywords, abstracts and conclusions of each paper and scanning its content in order to ensure that whether they are relevant to the proposed study or not. However, 92 papers have been assessed. Nevertheless, 60% of the selected articles are published in the last five years in a period 2014–2019, since the majority of academic papers which particularly focused on sustainable development goals started in 2015. Additionally, selecting the most recent studies will ensure that the paper is addressing a new topic as well as identifying opportunities for new research. After all, 152 sources were cited in this study. Further, based on the results of the above two stages (data collection and screening), a simple scoring matrix was proposed in order to evaluate the influence of building materials in the achievement of sustainable development goals and their relevant targets. The scoring system has been reformed from the framework provided by Nilsson, Griggs, Visbeck et al. (2016) . The aggregation of the contribution score has been achieved through the following two steps. Firstly, the literature reviews have been used as an evidence base and point of entry to identify the most and least significance contribution of the various typology of building materials (introduced earlier in the procedure) in the realization of SDGs. Secondly, five points (from -1 to +3) and five scoring magnitudes (visible, reinforcing, enabling, invisible and constraining) have been proposed to indicate the contribution score. More specifically, positive contributions are assigned scores of either +3 (visible), +2 (reinforcing), or +1 (enabling), whereas contributions marked by trade-offs are scored with -1 (constraining). Also, a score of 0 (invisible) is assigned if there is no knowing a positive or negative contribution. Besides the number system, a colour scheme has been proposed to present the contribution scores, in which green colour represents a positive contribution, red colour indicates negative contribution, while plain colour shows no significant contribution. The final contribution score has been done based on a basic reading of the assessed papers and prior knowledge (Table 2  ). In the fourth step, a theoretical framework has been proposed for understanding those types of interactions and contributions between building materials and SDGs and their relevant targets. Building materials contribution score for each goal and target has been applied across the framework. In the last stage, the interpretation of the framework has been discussed and recommendations for future research are raised.  3 Results and discussion 3.1 The contributions of building materials to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their targets 3.1.1 Goal 1: end poverty in all its forms everywhere The high rates of urbanization and population growth over the past few years have been associated with an enormous demand for building and infrastructure development (Ahmad, Zhao, & Li, 2019 ) which resulted in shortage and high cost of residence units, high rents, and poor urban living environment (Ugochukwu & Chioma, 2015 ). Furthermore, the high cost of building materials is a serious challenge affecting against delivery of affordable homes, and public infrastructure and basic services for low-income people, especially in rural communities. In this regard, local building materials (e.g. wood, sand, gravel, clay, lime, etc.) can have a reinforcing contribution on ending some forms of poverty as well as reducing the impact of buildings on the environment. The utilization of local building materials can cut the construction cost to its barest minimum by about 60% (Ugochukwu & Chioma, 2015 ), enable low-income people to get access to decent housing at affordable cost with local technology while contributing to the reduction of poverty and building resilient local community, which reduce the local people exposure and vulnerability to the extreme external environmental disasters (Celentano, Escamilla, Göswein, & Habert, 2018 ). Accordingly, locally produced building materials can participate indirectly to achieve targets No. 1.4 (ensuring equal rights to economic resources, basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property) and 1.5 (reducing the exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events) of this goal. On the other hand, the use of green, advanced, and energy-efficient building materials may have a contradiction with SDG 1 and its related targets due to their initial high cost. In addition, a large number of building materials (including local materials) were identified to contain some form of toxicity (Isnin, Ahmad, & Yahya, 2013 ). These toxic chemicals often have severe consequences on human health (SDG 3), which in return impacts poverty levels. Therefore, applying inexpensive local sustainable techniques to produce local materials that are affordable, durable, environmentally friendly and extracted in a sustainable manner can enable the achievement of this goal without hindering the achievement of other goals.  3.1.2 Goal 3: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being The link between building/ materials and human health is increasingly recognized. Approximately, 1 in 4 of the total universal deaths is assigned to environmental risk factors (Corvalán & Üstün, 2006 ). People spent more than 90% of their time in enclosed spaces (Building 2030, 2017Building 2030, 2017 ), and accordingly indoor air typically responsible for over 90% of human exposure to pollutants (Hoisington et al., 2019 ). If they selected well, the materials of the building can play a major role in offering a healthy indoor environment and promoting well-being for all at all levels. On the contrary, hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos, formaldehyde, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury and lead-based paint) have been found in several construction materials (e.g. insulation, cement, coatings, roofing and flooring materials) and they have the potential to damage health and cause serious diseases, reduced growth, and could create what is known as a sick building syndrome (Kim & Yu, 2014 ; Passarelli, 2009 ; Petrovic´, Vale, & Zari, 2017 ; Sun et al., 2019 ; World Health Institute-WHO, 2016 ). Additionally, less often discussed but equally significant is the relation between the quality of building materials and psychological health. People living in a better quality building have fewer mental issues, including reduced anxiety and depression (Hoisington et al., 2019 ). Hence, quality materials that bring warmth and an appropriate atmosphere to space are of key importance. On the other hand, environmentally friendly, green, responsibly sourced, and alternative building materials have a direct contribution to provide a healthier indoor zones while enhancing the quality of the built environment (Bragança, Mateus, & Koukkari, 2010 ; Cai & Sun, 2014 ; D & M S, 2018 ; Huberman & Pearlmutter, 2008 ; Kubba, 2010 ; Patil & Patil, 2017 ; Sandanasamy, Govindarajane, & Sundararajan, 2011 ; Spiegel & Meadows, 2010 ). Promoting the use of these materials can prevent the users of the building from diseases of long duration and low progression (non-communicable-or chronic-diseases) like lung diseases, cancer, damage to the liver and central nervous system, which associated with hazardous chemicals emitted into the air from some building materials (Bartzis et al., 2008 ; FUCIC, 2012 ; Kim, Harrad, & Harrison, 2001 ; Zhang, Cao, Wei, & Zhang, 2018 ).  3.1.3 Goal 4: ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all Looking closely at target 4.7 of this goal (ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development), introducing the impacts of the various types of building materials on human health and environment, besides presenting their importance to support sustainable development through education systems will be a key to achieve UN 2030 agenda and promote a sustainable lifestyle for the next generation (Schmidt et al., 2017 ; Sichali & Banda, 2017 ; Umar et al., 2009 ). Additionally, applying green building materials in the construction of various educational facilities will give real examples for learners, increase the public awareness, and provide safe and healthy environments for people, nevertheless, it will enhance the quality of the education and promote sustainability.  3.1.4 Goal 6. ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all The construction industry consumes a massive amount of natural resources, for instance, natural materials, energy, and water. It is in charge of 16% consumption of global water (Heravi & Abdolvand, 2019 ). So, the consumption of water in the construction industry has a direct influence on water scarcity. Along these lines, building materials consume water during the extraction and processing of the raw materials, through the production stage and throughout the construction of the building. Therefore, increasing the use of green building materials and environmentally safe construction materials can reduce the embodied water of construction materials and increase water efficiency for overall sustainable development (Abd El-Hameed, 2018 ; Das, Bera, & Moulick, 2015 ). For instance, up to 20% reduction in water can be achieved by using fly ash as a partial substitution of portland cement in concrete (Chandra & Bendapudi, 2011 ). On the other hand, A number of construction materials (e.g. plumbing pipes, roofing materials, paints,) produce chemical hazards (e.g. copper, lead and cadmium) when they have direct contact with water through treatment, storage and distribution. These chemicals can be released from non-sustainable materials after putting in place (e.g. polymeric and elastomeric compounds from plastic fittings or tank linings) or due to the longer contact with water (e.g. soft water can increase metal pipes corrosion whilst hard water can cause scaling) (World health organization, 2010 ). Therefore, the selection of appropriate materials (including green, alternative, environmentally safe, and responsibly sourced building materials) can reduce pollution, minimize the release of hazardous chemicals and afterwards improve the quality of water (Bardhan, 2011 ; Sheth, 2017 ).  3.1.5 Goal 7. ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Globally, around 48% of the energy is consumed in the construction and operation of buildings (as embodied and operating energy) (Dixit, 2019 ). Nevertheless, building materials consume energy in every stage during their lifetime starting from the extraction of raw materials, manufacturing phase, transportation of materials to the project site, the installation and assembly of building materials, energy used for materials maintenance during building use, and the energy use for demolition and transportation of the materials to the landfill or to recycling site at the end of building life (Huberman & Pearlmutter, 2008 ; Zabalza Bribián, Valero Capilla, & Aranda Usón, 2011 ). In some cases, embodied energy can represent 40% of the total energy required for a 50 years lifespan expectation (Thormark, 2006 ). However, the use of local, green, environmentally friendly, alternative, energy-efficient, durable and low embodied energy building materials reducing the energy used in buildings, improving the global energy efficiency and serving in achieving SDGs (Akadiri, Chinyio, & Olomolaiye, 2012 ; Asif, Muneer, & Kelley, 2007 ; Basbagill, Flager, Lepech, & Fischer, 2013 ; Cai & Sun, 2014 ; Dodoo, Gustavsson, & Sathre, 2012 ; Macaluso, 2010 ; Mpakati-Gama, Sloan, & Wamuziri, 2012 ; S. Ramesh, 2011 ; Reddy & Jagadish, 2003 ; Shams, Mahmud, & Amin, 2012 ; Singh, Ishwarya, Gupta, & Bhattacharyya, 2015 ; Thormark, 2006 ; Venkatarama Reddy, 2009 ; Zhu, Hurt, Correia, & Boehm, 2009 ), for example, 50% reduction in the total embodied energy can be achieved in masonry load-bearing buildings when energy-efficient or alternative building materials are used (Reddy & Jagadish, 2003 ). Furthermore, durable building materials can reduce the embodied energy by approximately 76% (50 years lifetime) (Rauf & Crawford, 2015 ), while using local building materials can achieve 215% reduction in embodied energy (Morel, Mesbah, Oggero, & Walker, 2001 ).  3.1.6 Goal 8: decent work & economic growth - promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all The demand of building materials has been growing dramatically since the 1990s and it is expected to continue developing in the coming few years, determined in particular by the rapid industrialization and urbanization growth and high level of material consumption in developed countries (Liming, 2011 ). A wide variety of people (skilled and semi-skilled labour force) involved throughout the materials lifecycle from raw materials extraction, production, installation, and maintenance. Recently, the demand for green and alternative building materials in many countries have been accompanied by employing many people from various disciplines, which reflect the impact of building materials in the promotion of economic growth and employment. Also, the innovation in building materials industry and technologies can lead to higher productivity and better efficiency for the use of raw material resources (WGBC, 2017 ).  3.1.7 Goal 9: industry, innovation & infrastructure – build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation The development of reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure is connected directly by using green, advanced, durable, alternative, energy-efficient, low embodied energy, environmentally safe, and responsibly-sourced building materials for the construction of these facilities (Hossain, 2015 ; Pour-Ghaz, 2013 ). Their application in the construction of various infrastructures will ensure the quality and the durability of infrastructure (Balasbaneh, Bin Marsono, & Gohari, 2019 ; Schlangen & Sangadji, 2013 ; Wu, 2006 ) while participating in the development of clean, environmentally friendly and resilient infrastructure. The innovation in building materials industry will upgrade the development of adaptable, cost-effective and green infrastructure which can face the global challenges of climate change and future risks. On the other hand, locally available materials like wood, stone, lime, and mud have been replaced by modern construction materials such as steel and cement due to durability concerns. Although modern building materials are durable, they are costly, energy-intensive and harmful to health and well-being. Therefore, buildings structured with the main use of local building materials and well-selected modern construction materials will upgrade the creation of durable and environmentally sound infrastructure (Leo Samuel, Dharmasastha, Shiva Nagendra, & Maiya, 2017 ).  3.1.8 Goal 11: sustainable cities & communities – make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable By 2050, it is expected that 70% of the world’s population will live in cities (Silva et al., 2018 ; United Nation-UN, 2014 ) with an expected increase of the urban residents in developing world from 2.7 to 5.1 billion between 2011 until 2050 (J, 2015 ). This predicted growth is supposed to create several sustainability challenges, communally on infrastructure and the environment (Akande, Cabral, Gomes, & Casteleyn, 2019 ; Bibri & Krogstie, 2017 ; Han et al., 2017 ; Steverson & Steverson, 2018 ). If not properly controlled, the rapid urbanization can enlarge informal housing and poverty, poor waste management, in addition to, poor living conditions in cities. Therefore making green and healthy cities is considered a very important issue to achieve a sustainable future for the world (Balaban & Puppim de Oliveira, 2017 ; Giles-Corti, Lowe, & Arundel, 2019 ). For no doubt, buildings are the foundations of cities and communities, therefore building materials are key to their long-term sustainability. Using locally available building materials can reduce the construction cost, minimize the negative impacts of the buildings on the environment (Bredenoord, 2017 ; Kayode & Olusegun, 2013 ), and ensure access to affordable housing and basic services. Moreover, applying green, alternative, environmentally safe, and responsibly sourced building materials is a key for creating a sustainable community which will support the preservation of natural resources and minimize various environmental impacts associated with material’s extraction, transport, production, erection, maintenance, and demolition waste (Port, 2007 ).  3.1.9 Goal 12: ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Building materials industry plays a major role in promoting sustainable public procurement, through supporting the use of green, alternative, environmentally safe and responsibly sourced building materials for various construction practices to minimize the environmental impacts, and by encouraging the use of environmental assessments tools to evaluate their environmental impacts throughout their lifespan. Local building materials produced from local responsibly supplies achieve efficient utilization of natural resources. Building materials with green features are considered ecological, non-hazardous, non-polluting and non-radioactive materials (Cai & Sun, 2014 ). The use of these materials will achieve a healthy environment for human and minimize the negative effect of building on the built environment. Green Building materials have a major role to play in reducing waste through recycling, reuse and by using the cradle to grave approach (Kralj & Markič, 2008 ; Ng & Chau, 2015 ). Furthermore, the utilization of durable building materials is key to sustainable consumption, as their use gives precedence to minimizing the amount of materials resources employed and waste produced. On the other hand, the effective use of building materials is continually evaluated by various environmental assessment tools to ensure the achievement of sustainability in buildings (Park, Yoon, & Kim, 2017 ), while the use of green building materials has already encouraged companies and construction stakeholders to implement sustainability in various projects all over the world.  3.1.10 Goal 13: take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts The risks of extreme weather events are expected to grow as a result of both climate change, increasing urbanisation and increased needs for resources in urban areas (Andersson-sköld et al., 2015 ). However, building materials have a huge capability to mitigate the impact of buildings in the global greenhouse gases emissions and other climate-related hazards through the use of energy-efficient, green, environmentally friendly and alternative building materials (Huang et al., 2018 ; Sagheb et al., 2011 ). To limit these negative impacts, various environmental assessment methods and tools have been created and used to measure all the inputs and outputs of building materials throughout their lifetime (Najjar, Figueiredo, Palumbo, & Haddad, 2017 ) and many countries integrated these tools to their national policies and strategies (Klijn-Chevalerias & Javed, 2017 ). Supporting and encouraging the use of these tools and strategies all over the world, can occur great achievement regarding the SDGs.  3.1.11 Goal 14: conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development Although most of the built-environment is located on land, its impacts move to oceans. The built environment and building materials within the coastal watershed have indirect impacts on the sustainability of oceans and marine resources and they can form a permanent source of pollutants, as rainwater passes through the materials of the roofs, facades, and roadways and enters the nearby rivers and seas. Hazardous construction materials (e.g. metal with high zinc content and copper) can cause serious persistent toxicity and bioaccumulation to the marine environment, animals, and plants. Therefore, the use of alternative, green, environmentally safe, and responsibly sourced building materials protect the ecosystem habitats and achieve the related sustainability targets (Perkins & Will Architects, 2016 ; Petrović, Vale, Zari, & Zari, 2017 ).  3.1.12 Goal 15: Life on land – sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss The number of buildings and cities on land is rapidly increasing, and thus biodiversity and ecosystems are under intense pressure due to this event. The production and processing of building materials have an indirect impact on biodiversity, the extraction of building materials through mining and quarrying can be altered or even destroyed the natural habitats and species in the quarrying sites (Sahu & Dash, 2011 ). The above operations require large quantities of water and energy, and they have the potential of generating wastes and pollutants (Fugiel, Burchart-Korol, Czaplicka-Kolarz, & Smoliński, 2017 ). Also, promoting the application of local building materials may have negative impacts on coastal ecosystems from which the building materials are removed, and on their preservation and restoration. Therefore, promoting the use of green (renewable and recyclable), and responsibly sourced building materials is a key element to achieve sustainability and to ensure better conservation of natural resources as well as it can play a major role to combat desertification and restore degraded land and soil. The utilization of safe and efficient technologies during the extraction and processing of building materials consider an essential task to mitigate their environmental impact (Bloodworth, Scott, & McEvoy, 2009 ). Also, the encouraging use of responsibly sourced building materials and recycling approach can have a major role to preserve biodiversity and natural habitats (Opoku, 2019 ).  3.1.13 Goal 17: strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development The innovation in building materials industry will lead to a significant process to strengthen the partnership between the various construction stakeholders, in order to support the achievement of sustainable development goals in all countries. Nevertheless, numerous local and private programs and training have been established in many countries to assist and encourage the implementation of green building materials by sharing knowledge, experiences and professional practice (Nußholz, Nygaard Rasmussen, & Milios, 2019 ) (Table 3  ).   3.2 Building materials contribution framework The contribution of building materials in the achievement of 2030 sustainable development agenda has been clearly noticed in various goals. However, for some goals; unless we take a deeper look at each target, it would be very difficult to notice the influence of building materials on that goal. This clarifies the fact that while most of the 17 SDGs are presenting one of the three sustainability pillars, the three dimensions are actually inserted within their targets. Moreover, it explains the importance of implementing SDGs as an indivisible whole, even though it remains a challenge. Few authors have proposed frameworks to understand how to achieve one or more goals of the SDGs by implementing building materials. In this study, the authors have reformed the seven points interaction matrix introduced by Nilsson, Griggs, Visbeck, Ringler et al. (2016)  for the building materials. Furthermore, comprehensive explanations and classifications of building materials regarding their contribution to the achievement of the 17 SDGs and their targets have been conducted. The framework successfully fulfilled its ambition to provide clear findings by identifying factors, theories, and measures which can be employed for assessing and qualifying the suitability of building materials towards achieving sustainable development in the construction sector. The proposed framework showed that building materials have a direct and indirect contribution to the achievement of several SDGs and targets. It is found that building materials have a significant role to achieve 13 goals and 25 targets of the UN 2030 Agenda. The scoring method illustrated in this paper proposes measures by which complex and wide-ranging scientific data can be described in a form of an information framework to help policymakers and construction stakeholders to understand the role of building materials in the realization of SDGs (As shown in Table 4  ). Thus, the scale of the score, in either direction, gives an indication of how various typology of building materials contribute positively or negatively to achieve 2030 agenda. The positive contributions can be separated into two categories; direct and indirect. Direct positive contribution (+3) indicates that building materials have enviable participation to the achievement of the goal and it is relevant targets, while indirect positive contribution means building materials implicitly enabled or aided in the achievement of that goal or target. However, the indirect contribution has been presented on a scale of two numbers (+2 and +1) indicating that the impact of building materials in achieving SDGs are not aimed at primarily. The above table includes five columns. The first includes the sustainable development goals (SDGs); the second detects the best contribution score of building materials in each goal; the third identifies the contribution name; the fourth finds the best building materials typology to achieve the goal, and fifth shows the targets in which building materials can have higher contribution score to achieving them. 3.2.1 Direct positive contribution All the typologies of Building materials stated in this research plainly have a direct positive contribution (Visible +3) to promote health and well-being, improve the energy efficiency of the building, foster sustainable industrialization and innovation, create sustainable cities and communities, upgrade sustainable public procurement and play a major role to mitigate the impact of the built environment in the universe. Hence, they participate directly in the achievement of SDG 3, SDG 7, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 15 respectively. The attainment of the mentioned SDGs is associated directly by the use of green, alternative, local, environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, low embodied, advanced, durable, and responsibly sourced building materials for the construction of the buildings and various infrastructure worldwide. The framework showed that green, alternative, environmentally friendly, and responsibly sourced building materials are the most significant typologies of building materials, which play a major role to accomplish most of the SDGs. The presented examples on the framework concerning SDG 3 (health and well-being) showed that increasing the awareness of the impact of building materials on health, wellbeing, and productivity by applying non-toxic and healthy building materials (the four most significant typologies) should be considered as a top priority for the achievement of this goal and other SDGs. Furthermore, a remarkable contribution of building materials has been noticed in SDG 12 (ensure sustainable consumption and production pattern), in which building materials have the potential to achieve 5 sustainable development targets within the goal. The use of responsibly sourced and environmentally safe construction materials, as well as green and alternative materials, can minimize the use of natural resources and material consumption, and decrease the use of toxic substances as well as reduce the waste and pollutants over the material life cycle. Moreover, the framework revealed that the whole mentioned typologies of building materials are fundamental to the sustainability of infrastructure (SDG 9), thus they actively participate to mitigate climate-related disaster (SDG 13), as well as they, have a significant contribution to building resilience cities and communities in a larger context (SDG11). In addition, energy-efficient, low embodied energy and durable building materials have the potential to reduce the total energy consumption of the building, minimize the global carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions while contributing visibly to accomplish the SDGs (include SDG7, SDG9, SDG 12, and SDG 13). Also, promote the use of green and responsibly sourced building materials have indirect input to combat desertification and preserve biodiversity via the wise conservation of material resources (SDG 15). Nevertheless, the framework illustrated that building materials have a direct influence on reaching 17 targets within the above mentioned SDGs.  3.2.2 Indirect positive contribution Following the framework, indirect positive contributions (+2 and +1) have been shown in a range of SDGs including SDG 1, SDG 4, SDG 6, SDG 8, SDG 14, and SDG 17. An indirect relationship has been revealed, in which building materials have indirect effect on sub-indicators which lead to the achievement of the desired goal or target, for instance, using local building materials can reduce the construction cost, which in turn help poor people to build their own homes and reduce their exposure to the harsh outdoor environmental hazards, and ultimately ending some forms of poverty (SDG 1). Building materials have a higher capability to aid the achievement of SDG 6 and SDG 8 and four of their associated targets. In this line of thoughts, green, alternative, environmentally safe, and responsibly sourced building materials are the main critical typologies to enhance the water efficiency in the construction sector and to improve its global quality. Likewise, they can provide safe and healthy environments, which endorse decent work and sustainable economic growth. Another example has been presented in SDG 14, in which the use of green, alternative, environmentally safe, advanced, and responsibly sourced building materials in place of traditional materials can have an indirect impact in protecting coastal and marine ecosystems. Moreover, the framework signified that the nine typologies of the building materials can attain a healthy indoor environment and sustainable education infrastructure which sequentially enhance the education quality and offer good learning opportunities (SDG 4).  3.2.3 Negative contribution and trade-off Due to the fact that sustainable and green building materials are likely to have a direct influence on reducing global health and environmental impact, their affirmative contributions in the achievement of sustainable development outnumbered their negative contribution. Thus, negative contributions can be seen in limited spots within the study. In several cases, using local building materials creates restraints. For instance, the extraction of local materials from a specific geographical location to build low cost housing participate in offering affordable housing for the poor people of that region and contributing on the achievement of target 1.4 (end some form of poverty), while this action may hinder the progress of target 14.1 (prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, particularly from land-based activities), target 15.3 (combat desertification), and target 15.5 (reduce degradation of natural resources). So, promoting the use of local building materials may have negative impacts on coastal ecosystems from which the local raw materials are removed, and may affect the conservation and restoration of the natural resources and habitats. However, promoting wise conservation of material resources and encouraging the use of responsibly sourced materials can mitigate this gap. A further contradict has been noticed with the application of green, energy-efficient, advanced, and durable building materials. The higher initial cost of the above-mentioned materials make them beyond the affordability limit of the target people and may hinder the achievement of SDG 1 (End poverty). Although the framework gives clear findings; the academic literature review proved that building materials differ greatly in their impact on the environment and due to this complex nature it is impractical to study the interlinkages between all types of building materials and SDGs in a single framework. Additionally, the scoring system that is developed within the framework to assess the contribution of building materials on the achievement of SDGs is based on broader measures which indicate more advancement to fit in real construction practices. However, a scoring scale based on identified and agreed criteria to evaluate different building materials might be considered in future research.    4 Conclusions and outlook The conceptual framework presented in this research is initiated to support integrated thinking in building materials contribute to the attainment of the SDGs as well as to show how the selection of appropriate building materials achieves long-lasting sustainable development outcomes. The seven points interaction matrix introduced previously by Nilsson, Griggs, Visbeck et al. (2016)  has been adapted as a scoring scale for building materials throughout the current study. This paper describes the state-of-the-art review of the SDGs, with a particular emphasis on their applications and linkages with the buildings generally and with building materials specifically. Then, the framework is intended to give an example of how building materials contribute to the achievement of various sustainable development goals and targets. In short, there is a lack of information on this topic and more research is needed. It should be noted that the nine typologies of building materials presented a twofold role; as they contributed negatively and positively in reaching the SDGs. Although not every linkage between building materials and SDGs can be described by using the five points scale, the aggregation of the scale indeed classified most of the interactions. The framework developed in this paper revealed that building materials have a remarkable contribution to the achievement of 13 goals and 25 targets of the UN 2030 Agenda. They influence the enhancement of well-being, increasing energy and water efficiency, promoting responsible consumption and production, building resilient infrastructure and sustainable cities, and they have a huge capacity to mitigate climate change while accelerating the achievement of SDGs. Based on the findings, green, alternative, environmentally friendly, and responsibly sourced building materials are the four most significant building materials typologies which have a significant contribution in realizing most of the SDGs. An advantage of the developed framework is that investigating the contribution of building materials in the achievement of sustainable development goals and target impose the demonstration of basic understanding and awareness between designers, project developers, policymakers, professionals and construction stakeholders on how the classification and the selection of building materials have a significant impact in reaching sustainability and mitigating climate hazards. It also allows broad multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder discussions and offers a possibility to integrate knowledge required in policy formulation and realization of SDGs. The framework is expected to convert the sustainable development goals and their targets into a measurable tool to be achieved in the practice and guide the decision-making process successfully. Moreover, the gathered data offers useful visions about the possibilities and difficulties of implementing building materials to achieve sustainability and it contributes to the identification of further potential themes within the topic that need more investigation. The findings suggest that the selection of building materials based on their performance on health and environment should be considered as one of the most essential steps to achieving SDGs. Building materials should be identified based on the overlapping benefits from the combined characteristics of the mentioned nine typologies. Therefore, it is essential to create a multi-criteria optimization tool based on identified sustainability indicators to evaluate the efficiency of building materials before integrating them into buildings. However, more discussion is required on the limitations of the employed data sources and adopted methods. In the future, research supposes to show how each type of building materials act towards achieving sustainable development goals and what are the most effective criteria and measures we need to consider for material selection and evaluation to reach the ambition. However, as the progress goes towards the realization of SDGs, the need to address a wide range of tools and science-based analysis is highly required to achieve the goals in the remaining years. In addition, we also call for further applied research in the subject by investigating real case studies with construction industry professionals, decision-makers, materials manufacturers and other construction stakeholders for better understanding the barriers to be overcome in the field of construction and building materials to achieve 2030 agenda.
