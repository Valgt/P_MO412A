                  Decision Support System (DSS) is a novel approach for smart, sustainable controlling of environmental phenomena and purification processes. Toluene is one of the most widely used petroleum products, which adversely impacts on human health. In this study, Fusarium Solani fungi are utilized as the engine of the toluene bioremediation procedure for the monitoring part of DSS. Experiments are optimized by Central Composite Design (CCD) - Response Surface Methodology (RSM), and the behavior of the mentioned fungi is estimated by M5 Pruned model tree (M5P), Gaussian Processes (GP), and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMOreg) algorithms as the prediction section of DSS. Finally, the control stage of DSS is provided by integrated Petri Net modeling and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The findings showed that Aeration Intensity (AI) and Fungi load/Biological Waste (F/BW) are the most influential mechanical and biological factors, with P-value of 0.0001 and 0.0003, respectively. Likewise, the optimal values of main mechanical parameters include AI, and the space between pipes (S) are equal to 13.76 m3/h and 15.99 cm, respectively. Also, the optimum conditions of biological features containing F/BW and pH are 0.001 mg/g and 7.56. In accordance with the kinetic study, bioremediation of toluene by Fusarium Solani is done based on a first-order reaction with a 0.034 s-1 kinetic coefficient. Finally, the machine learning practices showed that the GP (R2 = 0.98) and M5P (R2 = 0.94) have the most precision for predicting Removal Percentage (RP) for mechanical and biological factors, respectively. At the end of the present research, it is found that by controlling seven possible risk factors in bioremediation operation through the FMEA- Petri Net technique, efficiency of the process can be adjusted to optimum value.

Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering The Faculty of Engineering The University of Auckland Private Bag 92019 Auckland 1142 New Zealand       Decision Support System (DSS) is a novel approach for smart, sustainable controlling of environmental phenomena and purification processes. Toluene is one of the most widely used petroleum products, which adversely impacts on human health. In this study, Fusarium Solani  fungi are utilized as the engine of the toluene bioremediation procedure for the monitoring part of DSS. Experiments are optimized by Central Composite Design (CCD) - Response Surface Methodology (RSM), and the behavior of the mentioned fungi is estimated by M5 Pruned model tree (M5P), Gaussian Processes (GP), and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMOreg) algorithms as the prediction section of DSS. Finally, the control stage of DSS is provided by integrated Petri Net modeling and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The findings showed that Aeration Intensity (AI) and Fungi load/Biological Waste (F/BW) are the most influential mechanical and biological factors, with P-value of 0.0001 and 0.0003, respectively. Likewise, the optimal values of main mechanical parameters include AI, and the space between pipes (S) are equal to 13.76 m3 /h and 15.99 cm, respectively. Also, the optimum conditions of biological features containing F/BW and pH are 0.001 mg/g and 7.56. In accordance with the kinetic study, bioremediation of toluene by Fusarium Solani is done based on a first-order reaction with a 0.034 s-1 kinetic coefficient. Finally, the machine learning practices showed that the GP (R2 = 0.98) and M5P (R2 = 0.94) have the most precision for predicting Removal Percentage (RP) for mechanical and biological factors, respectively. At the end of the present research, it is found that by controlling seven possible risk factors in bioremediation operation through the FMEA- Petri Net technique, efficiency of the process can be adjusted to optimum value.   Keywords Toluene  Bioremediation  Artificial intelligent  Soil resources  Statistical optimization  Risk assessment    1 Introduction Measurement, prediction, and treatment of petroleum contamination in soil, water, and air are considered complex issues (Rajendran et al., 2022 ). This fact is related to the multifaceted and specific nature of petroleum compounds and their interactions with the environment (Guo et al., 2022 ). These compounds have a wide range of carcinogenic effects and can lead to significant epidemiological effects through bioaccumulation (Nfor et al., 2022 ). The soil environment is more undefined and complex in comparison to water and air due to the variety of compounds and processes. Likewise, decontamination of pollution from soil is assumed as a challenging process because of several intricate variables. In the classical definition of soil bioremediation procedure, there are several stages including synthesizes microbial community, gene editing, microbial consortium, and metabolic reconstruction (Jaiswal, and Shukla, 2020 ). However, from the engineering aspect, the main focus is on the implementation of organisms as the main part of bio-engines with consideration of mechanical and biological dimensions. (Zhang et al., 2013 ). Toluene is one of the most widely used Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), considered an important pollutant due to its role in ground-level ozone formation and adverse health effects on humans (Ukhurebor et al., 2021 ; Khan et al., 2020 ; Chai et al., 2022 ; Yu et al., 2022 ). The human can be exposed to toluene by breathing, touching, or swallowing, which causes several adverse effects on human body, including neurological effects, eyes irritation, muscle fatigue, disturbance of cardiac autonomy, respiratory depression, and kidney and liver damage (Fig. 1  ) (Polyong and Thetkathuek, 2022 ; Zuo et al., 2022 ; OSHA, 2022 ; Zuo et al., 2022 ; Rajabi et al., 2020 ; Arslan et al., 2018 ). In industrial areas, Toluene is mostly released into the soil through leaking underground storage tanks. There are several methods for contaminated soil treatment, including physical, biological, and chemical methods. The use of biological treatment methods such as bioremediation is often recommended over other methods because of its alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Ramanayaka et al., 2019 ). As illustrated in Fig. 1 , three general scenarios can be imagined in the event of toluene leaking into the soil. The first scenario is that leakage occurs near the soil surface; toluene is a highly volatile substance; therefore, it evaporates rapidly and can enter the human body through respiration, which is harmful, especially to residents of residential areas near industrial complexes (Kim et al., 2021 ; Win-Shwe and Fujimaki, 2010 ). The second scenario is when a small amount of leakage occurs deep in the soil; in this case, toluene can be biodegraded. Finally, the last scenario could occur when the amount of leakage is significant, and microorganisms are unable to degrade a high amount of toluene due to the toxicity of hydrocarbons. Therefore, toluene remains in the soil for several days; eventually could contaminate groundwater, which potentially causes health issues for consumers. A literature search has revealed that there have been several published studies on the removal of toluene and different techniques used for remediation of contaminated media (e.g., Semer and Reddy, 1998 ; Reddy et al., 1999 ). For instance, Semer and Reddy (1998)  described various contaminant removal mechanisms with experimental data obtained for toluene removal from Ottawa sand and fine gravel by air sparging. Similarly, Reddy et al. (1999)  investigated the removal of volatile organic compounds from saturated soils through air sparging. Lee et al. (2002)  assessed the impact of soil structure on removing HOC, toluene, and TCB from soils. They Optimized the composition of soil texture for optimum HOC removal using aqueous surfactant solutions. Others studies include Lee et al. (2005) , who evaluated toluene removal from groundwater and selected potentially suitable surfactants to dissolve toluene. Flores et al. (2007)  reported a new process for the remediation of hydrocarbons from contaminated soil, using the integration of Fenton-type catalyst oxidative method and ultrasonic energy. Long et al. (2013)  assessed the effect of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate on the remediation of soil and aquifers contaminated with hydrophobic organic compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. Amin et al. (2014)  evaluated the combination of bioventing and soil vapor extraction for toluene removal from soils. Also, they studied the effect of soil water content and airflow rate on soil vapor extraction. More recently, Mohammadi et al. (2021)  presented a method to decontaminate antibiotics from soil resources by fungus through a bioremediation procedure. Likewise, Li et al. (2022)  studied the toluene denitrifying bacteria, mixed cultures enriched from soils, or activated sludge due to the coking process, community structures, and functional gene diversity. There are different methods for purifying petroleum compounds from soil resources, but biological techniques are more popular because they are more efficient and environmentally friendly (Mirabi et al., 2019 ; Waychal et al., 2022 ). Therefore, our study concentrates on applying bioremediation to purify the toluene from soil environments. Following an evaluation of the above-mentioned studies, the development of an effective computational intelligence strategy for improving the performance of toluene bioremediation from the soil is still warranted, and it can be regarded as an important research gap. Another aspect of research that is needed is the potential use of Fusarium Solani  for toluene biodegradation. In this work, we make an attempt to provide the following contributions to fill the gaps identified above. Specific objectives of this study are to:• design and construct a lab-scale soil bioremediation system to assess the toluene removal from soil resources using Fusarium Solani  fungus.  • use the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize effective parameters on the performance of the toluene bioremediation process by adjusting the Central Composite Design (CCD). Predict the interaction of Fusarium Solani  and toluene in the soil by the M5 Pruned model tree (M5P), Gaussian Processes (GP), and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMOreg) algorithms.  • conduct a case study in Mashhad, Iran, using the proposed smart system in a real field contaminated soil.  • assess how sustainable development goals (SDGs) are achieved through this study.  • conduct a scientometric analysis of the bioremediation application in the oil industries, and  • present a Decision Support System (DSS) as an operational bioremediation controlling system with the application of integrated Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Petri Net models.     2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study roadmap and the case study The study framework of this research consists of three parts, including optimization and performance analysis, prediction, and controlling (Fig. 2  ); all together consist of a DSS. The first section starts with optimization of mechanical and biological factors through RSM-CCD method, and in the following, for a better understanding of the bioremediation process, Kinetic evaluation, selectivity analysis, and mechanism assessment were performed. Then, three different ML techniques were used for the prediction stage and evaluated by regression coefficient evaluation. Finally, for the controlling stage, a combination of FMEA and Petri Net modeling makes an early warning scanning management system Also at the conclusion of this study, the performance of optimal operating conditions is evaluated using real-world data from a petroleum-refinery plant in Iran. The case study of this research is a petroleum-refinery plant located in the northeast of Iran, which was established in 2014. Toluene concentration in the case study is shown in Fig. S.1  from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2021.  2.2 Laboratory practices The scheme of lab-scale setup is illustrated in Fig. 3  , as it is shown in this figure setup is controlled by an Arduino board. Also, Table 1   summarizes the study materials and instruments. All operated chemical compounds are obtained from Sigma Aldrich, USA. Also, the Iranian Genetic Bank (IGB) provided the Fusarium Solani  seed. All solutions were made with deionized water produced in the lab by a portable water deionizer. It should be mentioned that all soil samples come from a toluene-free area of the case study. Similarly, all samples for real-world experimental attempts and bio-engine performance evaluation come from three contaminated locations. In this regard, the toluene Removal Percentage (RP) result is evaluated in the context of a case study of pollution circumstances. Fungus planting, pH control, and air pressure were all done manually, as shown in this diagram (Offline mode in each run). In addition, the soil temperature was changed automatically with the integration of temperature sensors and a controlling board (online system). The initial concentration of toluene in the lab-scale setup was adjusted to 1.25 mg/L as the maximum dosage (Fig. S.1 ). For detection of the microscopic and macroscopic specification of Fusarium Solani  fungi in the soil, the combination of Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and Carnation Leaf-piece Agar (CLA) was utilized (Leslie and Summerell, 2008 ). Gas Chromatography Varian (GC 3600 Model) with Flame Ionization Detector (FID) was applied for the exact measurement of toluene concentration in the soil. The primary temperature of the column was set at 40 °C for 10 min. By 10 °C/min temperature rate, the mentioned parameter reaches 230 °C. Finally, the temperature at the injection site of the sample was adjusted to 250 °C (Li et al., 2020 ).  2.3 Numerical efforts Design of experiments (DOE) is an efficient method to study the relationship between variables and responses (Sadeghi-Moghaddam et al., 2019 ). There are several experimental design techniques such as, Taguchi, Box-Behnken, and RSM (Chouhan et al., 2021 ; Samadi et al., 2018 ). In the present research, CCD-RSM as a statistical optimization concept was applied to adjust the influential factors in optimal conditions through Design Expert 7.0.0 software (Eftekhari et al., 2020 ). The categories of experiments (biological and mechanical), type, and range of factors was set based on Mohammadi et al. (2021)  work, which is demonstrated in Fig. 4  . During the optimization process, mechanical features were adjusted in the optimum condition, and in this step, all biological factors were set at median values and reaction time at 20 days. Then, the CCD-RSM adjusted the biological parameters with reaction time set at 20 days and mechanical parameters at optimum values. As shown in Fig. 4 , the reaction time was optimized by the one-factor-at-a-time method. Then, the kinetic of the reaction was appraised by pseudo-zero/first/second-order computations. Therefore, the order of the reaction was determined for the kinetic study, and then the reaction rate constant was calculated. GP, SMOreg, and M5P are the computational intelligence approaches used in the controlling section of DSS. Fig. S.2  explains each technique's software and circumstances. The major objective is to track and anticipate bio-engine behavior to decontaminate toluene from the soil environment. The originality of our work is that we compare various approaches before introducing a hybrid computational intelligence algorithm (Ghadami et al., 2021 ; Shahsavar et al., 2021 ).  2.4 Semi-analytical methods In this study, for the implementation of a non-linear controlling system in the bioremediation procedure, the Petri Net model is utilized. With the operation of the Petri Net model, optimum conditions of the purifying process are controlled as a semi-analytical method (Amini et al., 2021 ). The schematic plan of the Petri Net model utilization can be seen in Fig. S.3 . Finally, for the evaluation of risks in the decontamination process, the FMEA method is used (Fig. S.3 ) (Gheibi et al., 2019 ). For the FMEA assessment, the mean value of nine experts' scores from the Environmental Protection Agency of Iran were applied in this study. The declared experts have graduated from Iran's high-ranked universities with at least a master's degree in Environmental Engineering. All the experts were from Iran and each one of them suggested some risk number for each collapse situation in the FMEA and the mean value of their scores are utilized for risk assessment.   3 Result and discussions 3.1 Statistical optimization and sensitive analysis According to CCD-RSM evaluations, the quadratic model is selected to predict RP, which is considered a cost function based on effective mechanical and biological parameters. The mechanical and biological-based mathematical formulas are demonstrated below through Equations (1) and (2 ), respectively. Also, Tables S.1 and S.2  listed the raw data of biological and mechanical optimization experiments, respectively.(1) RP  = − 83.29240  + 5.55579  ∗  S  + 12.04279  ∗  A I  + 3.10017  ∗  D  − 0.12080  ∗  S  ∗  A I − 0.10640  ∗  S  ∗  D + 0.073068  A I ∗ D + 0.040757 ∗ S 2  − 0.44535 ∗ A I 2  − 0.049484 ∗ D 2      (2)  RP  = − 257.74856 + 12.71808 ∗ T + 55.40179 ∗ p H − 336.64526 ∗ F / B W +  0.10833 + T ∗ p H − 0.68404 ∗ T ∗ F / B W + 48.43920 ∗ p H ∗ F / B W − 0.23483 ∗ T 2  − 4.69123 ∗ p H 2  − 2726.63206 ∗ F / B W 2       Based on statistical modeling in the mechanical section of the present research (Fig. 5  ), it can be observed that the created polynomial model is acceptable for available experimental data (with a 0.85 correlation coefficient). Besides, the predicted correlation coefficient of mechanical features is 0.32, which is not suitable for estimating unknown conditions based on the model. Therefore, other mathematical or algorithmic methods should be utilized to execute a smart prediction platform. Likewise, the modeling of biological section with 0.91 (R2 ) and 0.18 (Predicted-R2 ) has similar behavior. Fig. 6   provides the results of statistical Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests for mechanical and biological factors that are utilized to develop the forecasting model. The absence of a significant fit coefficient in errors demonstrates the high precision and accuracy of recommended quadratic equations. As a result, the mechanical parameters for ANOVA computations in this study are shown in Fig. 6 . The AI with a P-value of less than 0.0001 can be applied as the most relevant element for all parameters. Furthermore, based on the computations, the F-value of AI is 58.85. As an outcome, the AI has the most significant impact on the RP through the bioremediation process in this study. However, the NH has the least impact on the RP compared to other parameters. The sensitivity analysis of S, AI, and D is presented in Fig. 7  a. As observed from these diagrams, the AI and D account for the most and least effective mechanical parameters, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6 , the P-value of the F/BW ratio is 0.0003, which makes it the most effective factor for RP prediction. With a P-value of 0.0062, pH is the second most effective parameter on RP estimation. Finally, T had the least effect in the RP, with a P-value of 0.1725. Fig. 7  shows response surface plots of biological parameters in relativity with RP. Fig. S.4  depicts the evaluation of experimental data normality for mechanical (Fig. S.4-a ) and biological (Fig. S.4-b ) parameters optimization. All mechanical and biological experimental outcomes are distributed in the neighborhood of the normal standards diagram, and as a result, the experimental results in this study followed the statistical normal distribution (Fig. S.4 ). Suggested optimal values for mechanical and biological parameters are shown in Table 2  . Based on these results, the selected optimal circumstances evaluated in the lab setting demonstrate acceptable accuracy. The RP will be more than 99%, with the optimal mechanical and biological factors values. In addition, Fig. S.5  depicts the ideal curves for optimal values of mechanical parameters. Also, the desirability of biological and mechanical models for forecasting removal percentages are one and >0.95, respectively, which shows that both mechanical and biological regression equations have suitable performance based on available data. Also, literature shows other investigations on Fusarium Solani  reached the same results. Yan and Nelson Jr (2020)  investigated the effect of temperature on the growth of Fusarium Solani  and reported that the maximum growth occurred at 29.3 °C. Another earlier study by Merlin et al. (2013)  showed the effect of temperature and pH on Fusarium Solani  growth; their results showed that the best temperature for Fusarium Solani  growth was 25 °C, and this strain has a high growth rate at 30 °C as well. As for pH, their investigation shows that the optimum pH for maximum growth and bioactive metabolite production is 6. However, this strain has a high growth rate and bioactive metabolite production in pH between 5 and 8.  3.2 Bioremediation kinetics The kinetic evaluation of toluene removal from the soil based on RP (%) and remaining pollution is shown in Fig. 8  . The optimum condition occurs on day 35th, when approximately 90% of toluene is eliminated in the optimum conditions. Additionally, as per Fig. 8 -b, the mentioned bioremediation procedure has two different fast and slow kinetic mechanisms in the optimum condition. As shown in Equation (3)  the kinetic computations are based on three zero-order, first-order, and second-order reactions. Based on the mentioned computations, the correlation coefficient of zero, first, and second reactions in the fast kinetic section are equal to 0.85, 0.74, and 0.66, respectively. Therefore, the fast kinetic bioremediation procedure is assumed zero-order or first-order with 0.028 mg/L.s and 0.06 s−1 . Also, several other studies (Li et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2022 ; Cao et al., 2022 ) reported that most man-made reactions are considered first-order, which is in line with the outputs of this study. Besides, in the slow reaction, the correlation coefficient of zero-order, first-order, and second-order are calculated as 1, 0.99, and 0.96. Thus, again first-order reaction is selected with 0.034 s−1 .(3) R a t e = − d C  d t   = k C n      where,n = 0 → C = − k t + C 0  ⇒ Z e r o − o r d e r     n = 1 → C = C 0  e − k t   ⇒ F i r s t − o r d e r     n = 2 → 1 C  = k t + 1 C 0   ⇒ S e c o n d − o r d e r       3.3 Interfering effects Fig. 9   depicts the interfering effects for determining toluene purification in competition with Xylene, 3,4-Xylenol, and Benzonitrile, which are measured based on several published studies (Miri et al., 2022 ; Das et al., 2022 ; Chen et al., 2022 ). The remediation of toluene and 3,4-Xylenol was the most efficient based on the optimum condition of the bioremediation procedure. Although the volatility of toluene and 3,4 Xylenol is considerable, they are stabilized in the soil structure with mixing operation through the test in the lab-scaled setup. It is worth noting that petroleum contaminations are volatile, and the integration of heating, aeration, and biodegradation has specific effects on pollution elimination. The three mechanisms seemed to have good performance for decontamination of toluene compared to Xylene, 3,4-Xylenol, and Benzonitrile through the approved optimum situation obtained from CCD-RSM computations.  3.4 Mechanisms of toluene treatment In our study, different mechanisms are accounted for toluene decontamination. The three most influential parameters in this study are temperature, aeration, and biodegradation (Li et al., 2022 ; Mohammadi et al., 2021 ). In this study, to investigate the share of each mechanism in the removal of toluene, we tried to limit other factors and study these three parameters one by one. First, the temperature was set at 37 °C in a reactor without the presence of Fusarium Solani  and aeration. Then, for the second phase, the temperature was set at 18 °C and the aeration set at 20 m3 /h without the presence of Fusarium Solani . Finally, to investigate the effect of biodegradation, the AI was adjusted to 4 m3 /h and the temperature to 18 °C, which are the minimum required amounts for Fusarium Solani  to be active enough for biodegradation (Yan and Nelson Jr, 2020 ; Merlin et al., 2013 ). The result shows that less than 20% of toluene removal takes place during the heating procedure, 38% for the aeration process, and biodegradation is accounts for 46% of toluene removal. Finally, all parameters were set to optimum values to compare these results with the synergic effect of all three mechanisms. As shown in (Fig. 10  ), outcomes show 96% removal in the optimum condition, which is much higher than other mechanisms.  3.5 Machine learning computations The outcomes of machine learning computations for forecasting RP based on mechanical and biological features are summarized in Table 3  . As shown in Table 3 , for the mechanical section GP algorithm has the most efficiency with a 0.98 correlation coefficient for estimation of RP. While in the biological stage, the most efficient model is M5P algorithm with R2 = 0.94. While, the predicted-R2  in outputs of CCD-RSM for both mechanical and biological equations were 0.32 and 0.18, respectively. Therefore, by applying machine learning computations, the efficiency of prediction in mechanical and biological stages are enhanced 67% and 80%, respectively. According to previous outcomes, GP, M5P, and SMOreg algorithms are utilized to compare with predicted-R2 in CCD-RSM. While, based on ML computations, the ML algorithms' correlation coefficients are more acceptable compared to the predicted one in CCD-RSM. During the ML model tuning, the split percentage of the train-test process is adjusted to the optimum value to find the maximum correlation coefficient. CCD-RSM method computed all statistical indicators and regression model as per mathematical polynomial curve fitting with consideration to all available data. Besides, 80–90% of data is used for train in the ML computations, and others are applied for the test process. In the following, the split percentage is set at 75% for all algorithms to test them in the same circumstances for sensitive analysis. The sensitive analysis values of mechanical (Fig. 11  -a) and biological (Fig. 11 -a) factors with five test cases for actual, GP, SMOreg, and M5P are illustrated in Fig. 11 . Both residual diagram (Fig. 12  ) and standard error values (Fig. 13  ) demonstrate that in ML computations of mechanical features, during sensitive analysis, the GP model had the most precision due to RP predication in comparison to actual values and standard error values in the mechanical section have considerable difference among all algorithms. While based on Fig. 12 -b, it is clear that in the biological section, the behavior of the algorithms is the same in different conditions. However, the efficiency of SMOreg is more acceptable in comparison to other ones during RP prediction in biological category. Finally, sensitivity analysis of test values shows that GP can estimate the mechanical RP with high efficiency in both optimum and non-optimum (sensitive analysis and same conditions for all algorithms) conditions. While, for biological features, in the optimum and non-optimum situations, M5P and SMOreg have the most accuracy.  3.6 DSS and risk analysis In this study, for smart management of the bioremediation process, the outcomes of CCD-RSM computations are modeled through the Petri Net concept. However, before the declared modeling, the risks of processes are appraised by the FMEA method. As per the FMEA system, the risks of collapses in the bioremediation procedure are assessed based on three P, S, and D numbers obtained from the ideas of Environmental Experts. The mentioned experts presented their ideas on each scenario (Table 4  ) on a 1 to 10 scale. The presented values as P, S, and D numbers in Table 4  are the mean amounts of experts’ feedback. Based on the alarm management platform of this study as illustrated in Fig. 14  , it can be observed that R1, R3, and R6 are at the highest level of risk in the bioremediation process, and when they occur, the process must be stopped to execute other preventive activities (Gheibi et al., 2019a ). Also, the R2 and R5 events are located in the second level of risk, and in the declared situation, some different repairing activities should be done based on experts’ opinions. It is important to note that both R7 and R4 are considered in the next steps of risks, and they can be controlled with some simple advice during the bioremediation procedure (Gheibi et al., 2019b ). After establishing the presented alarm management system based on the FMEA concept, the controlling algorithm is designed by Petri Net modeling, as demonstrated in Fig. 15  . It is worth noting that all risk scenarios are modeled with specific priority based on FMEA categorization through Petri Net modeling. P1, P2 and P3 loops control the pollution load, AI, and F/BW factors with some operational advice. Also, the reaction time value is adjusted based on P7's cycle. The value of pH and the health of pipes are compared to optimum values in the P9 and P10 loops. Finally, the temperature was evaluated in the last two cycles. In this model, Pi and Ti are linked to places and transfers, which express rules and pass to next step conditions, respectively. In the present research, all applied P/T in the Petri Net scheme (Fig. 15 ) are defined as below:P1: Measuring the load of toluene in the bio-engine (weekly).  P2: Testing the Total Organic Carbon in bioreactor (TOC) (daily).  P3: Testing the air compressor based on pump's catalog.  P4: Mixing extra amount of clean soil for dilution the load of toluene.  P5: Adding biological waste to bioreactor and mixing it for controlling biological waste.  P6: Calibrating the air compressor.  P7: Detecting the reaction time of bioremediation process.  P8: Detecting the optimum time for bioremediation procedure.  P9: Measuring the value of pH in the soil sample (daily).  P10: Checking the health of pipes visually.  P11: Adding NaOH or HNO3 for adjusting pH.  P12: unclog the pipes mechanically and chemically.  P13: Checking T1-T12 conditions.  P14: Adjusting the optimum conditions based on CCD-RSM results.  P15: Checking the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus in bioreactor.  P16: Measuring temperature of bioreactor.  P17: Adding nitrogen, phosphorus to the bioreactor and mixing it with soil.  P18: Adjust the bioreactor temperature by heating.  P19: Sending the message to operators about the health of process.  T1: Is the toluene concentration less than 1.25 mg/L?

However, these indicators are more balanced in developed countries than in developing ones. For instance, in developing countries such as Iran, the economic aspects are the main barrier to reaching SDGs (Shahsavar et al., 2022 ). The present study emphasizes on all aspects of SDGs by applying a sustainable, low-cost petroleum decontamination system. The evaluation of SDGs is demonstrated in Fig. S.6 , and it illustrates how the implementation of this study's methods for toluene decontamination contributes to achieving these goals. According to Fig. S.6 , three main goals and three targets related to these goals are presented in the current study. With increasing petroleum industrialization, the emission of toluene is extended in the soil environment. The mentioned pollution is assumed to be a hazardous material, and it causes different immunological and epidemiological effects on human health (Gheibi et al., 2019b ). However, with the execution of the bioremediation system (Fusarium Solani ) and smart computations for the operation of the procedure, toluene can be eliminated from the soil, and the SDGs Target 3.9 (reduce illnesses and deaths from hazardous chemicals and pollution) has been met. Also, as mentioned before, toluene can contaminate groundwater resources. However, it can be prevented by implementing this bioremediation system which is in line with SDGs Target 6.3 (improve water quality, wastewater treatment, and safe reuse). Finally, one of the targets of SDGs is to adopt environmentally friendly technologies and processes in the industry; and bioremediation is known as one of the most environmentally friendly methods for soil remediation. Therefore, SDGs Target 9.4 (Upgrade all industries and infrastructures for sustainability) can be achieved by using bioremediation for decontamination of pollutants such as toluene.  3.8 Scientometric analysis As a holistic view of this study, a databank from previous studies about bioremediation of petroleum pollutants is created by the Scopus datacenter and the outcomes of this data gathering are analyzed by VOSviewer software. In this evaluation, the country distribution (Fig. S.7-a ), and keywords occurrence (Fig. S.7-b ) are illustrated in Fig. S.7 . Based on Fig. S.7 -a, it is notable that China and USA have the most contribution to the decontamination of toluene by bioremediation system. Bioremediation of petroleum from soil resources is a research gap, and with the application of the decontamination system through the present investigation, the gap can be filled (Fig. S.7-b ).   4 Conclusions In this study, the application of biological activities of Fusarium Solani  in a bio-engine is appraised for decontamination of toluene from soil resources. The effective mechanical and biological factors based on RP (%) are optimized by the CCD-RSM method, and machine learning computations evaluate the behavior of the mentioned bioreactor. Based on the findings obtained, it was concluded that AI is the most effective factor for biodegradation of toluene from soil because of its ability to provide required oxygen for oxidation-reduction reaction in the bulk of soil. Considering the reaction, Fusarium Solani  transfers the electrons as a bridge between toluene and oxygen; therefore, the biodegradation procedure depends on oxygen availability and fungus performance. Also, in the metabolic aspect, it is clear that the adequacy of food and the population of microorganisms is essential for complete reaction assurance. Also, it can be found that machine learning computations have appropriate performance for the prediction of RP (%) based on effective features. Finally, the integrated FMEA-Petri Net model was convenient for controlling possible risks in the bioremediation operation of toluene. For future studies, more efforts should be placed on apply metaheuristic algorithms to optimize effective biological and mechanical parameters instead of CCD-RSM and compare their outcomes. Additionally, the performance of the synergic bioremediation methods on other petroleum contaminations can be appraised as a novel idea. Another aspect to consider is the evaluation of other species of fungus or other organisms, such as algae, bacteria, etc., for biodegradation of toluene. Finally, SEM, TEM, XPS, and FT-IR can be useful as a powerful quantitative description of the exact determination of complete bioremediation mechanisms compared to heating, aeration, adsorption and accumulation.
