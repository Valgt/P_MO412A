                  To design an ample policy for sustainable development has become crucial for developed and developing nations. Environmental awareness adjusted sustainable development policy is a challenge for developing nations. Therefore, this work attempts to investigate the impacts of renewable energy on CO2 emissions by including other factors like, education, GDP, natural resources and foreign direct investment for G11 economies over the time period of 1990–2019. The empirical results show that renewable energy and education reduce CO2 emissions by 0.49 and 0.11% respectively. Foreign direct investment and natural resources degrade the environment 0.15% and 0.09% respectively. Heterogeneous causality results show feedback association between renewable energy, education, GDP and CO2 emissions. This work provides policy implication for G11 countries to invest on renewable and education sector. Therefore, these countries can achieve sustainable goals in a systematic way.

Environmental awareness adjusted sustainable development policy is a challenge for developing nations. Therefore, this work attempts to investigate the impacts of renewable energy on CO2 emissions by including other factors like, education, GDP, natural resources and foreign direct investment for G11 economies over the time period of 1990–2019. The empirical results show that renewable energy and education reduce CO2 emissions by 0.49 and 0.11% respectively. Foreign direct investment and natural resources degrade the environment 0.15% and 0.09% respectively. Heterogeneous causality results show feedback association between renewable energy, education, GDP and CO2 emissions. This work provides policy implication for G11 countries to invest on renewable and education sector. Therefore, these countries can achieve sustainable goals in a systematic way.   Keywords Education  Renewable energy  GDP  G11    1 Introduction Today, world's economies are integrating to make sustainable industrial units and to improving their living conditions. Addressing climate change has become a challenge among the other goals of sustainable development in developing and developed world [1–3 ]. Recent findings about the increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have further deteriorated situations [4 ]. It was surprising that along with developing economies developed countries has also increased 2.5% of emissions due to energy consumption. Therefore, it has become immediate problem and the governments need to resolve emissions problem on emergency basis. In the light of public awareness in later part of 20th century, different state level ecological organizations have been formed [5 ]. These institutions have shown incredible achievements due to the environmental awareness among people [6 ]. In this context, Akerlof [7 ] provided three important factors that can increase environmental awareness. Firstly, individual behavior needs to be addressed by affective policy instruments. Secondly, policy-making organizations should be established on democratic values. Thirdly, direct focus should be on society level values and education. Environmental education is a key factor in improving air quality in any country [8 ]. In academic research, there lie evidences that environmental awareness holds strong position in energy policies to improve air quality [9 ]. According to recent research, G11 countries provided insufficient progress to achieve sustainable goals. The careful examinations show the low incursion of renewable energy in production units in G11 countries. One of the main reasons behind this shortfall may be the insufficient research and innovation initiatives. Low research and development may be due to the low education attainment in G11 countries, which can affect environmental quality in two ways: by hampering the innovative renewable energy solutions and by limiting the environmental awareness among the people [10 ]. Therefore, education success can effect renewable energy generation, which ultimately affects environmental quality. Grossman [11 ] highlighted that education attainment increases environmental awareness, which forces the policy makers to form environmental policies effectively. Due to these policies, the inverted U shape association is formed, which is called environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Hence, it can be said that education plays an important role in improving air quality and it can be an effective tool to achieve sustainable goals. Therefore, effects of education, economic growth and clean energy are crucial to form climatic policies. Moreover, the role of foreign direct investment (FDI) is of importance in economic equation of the country because it can attract efficient technologies for renewable energy production. Therefore, FDI also affect climatic quality [12 ]. Natural resource consumption also holds important position in effecting climate quality [13 ]. To achieve economic growth, natural resource consumption may degrade the environment [14 ]. Therefore, to achieve sustainable economic growth, climatic quality needs to be improved. This study aims to investigate this relationship for G11 countries over the time spam of 1990–2019. These member countries are Croatia, Jordan, Georgia, Honduras, Morocco, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Paraguay, El Salvador and Ecuador. The motivation of this study relies in the fact that these countries are mostly developing and facing the problem of climate change. Moreover, these countries are lagging behind in education attainment [15 ]. Therefore, this research is an attempt to form a sustainable development goal (SDG) 13 and SDG 7 for G11 countries. This policy framework will be designed by considering the impact of education in making renewable energy-CO2 relationship. This study contributes here. Related literature review is presented in section 2 , methodology and data specification is in section 3 , results and discussion are in section 4 , section 5  consist of conclusion and policy implications. 1.1 Literature review G11 is a group comprises of 11 developing countries aiming at to help their debt burden by increasing ties with developed nations. These countries aim to increase their economic growth by maximum utilization of available natural resources. In effort to speed up the economic activity, these developing countries are relying mostly on fossil fuels for energy consumption, which is creating environmental problems [16 ]. Efficient means of cleaner production can reduce environmental pollution but due to lower literacy rate, these countries had not been able to increase their research and development in energy sector. Moreover, insufficient education attainment has not created environmental awareness in these nations. According to Mehmood and Tariq [3 ], developing nations are more vulnerable to climatic problems than developed nations. Past literature has suggested that policy makers have to formulate environmental friendly policies in developing nations to address climate change [2 ,3 ,17–23 ]. Polzin et al. [24 ] investigated the impacts of public policy on renewable energy. They suggested the formulation of public policies for renewable energy usage. Moreover, institutional capacity needs to enhance in order to increase clean energy in OECD countries. From this perspective, this section will evaluate the available research studies, which investigate the associations between climatic quality, energy use, economic growth, natural resources, FDI, and renewable energy consumption. In this context, Bin Jebli [25 ] probed the linkages of CO2 emissions, GDP, energy use and trade. They validated EKC by finding that increased trade and renewable energy are important to curb CO2 emissions. This is understandable that international trade can bring innovative technologies to combat climate problems. In another work, Shafiei and Salim [26 ] applied stochastic impacts on population, technology and affluence in OECD nations over the time period of 1980–2011. They found that non-renewable energy use creates environmental problems and renewable energy reduces energy consumption. Their study validated EKC between urbanization and climatic quality. Zhu et al. [27 ] applied Panel quintile regression for the association of energy use, FDI, and GDP on CO2 emissions in ASEAN nations. They found that FDI can improve air quality. Moreover, different independent variables exact heterogeneous effects on CO2 emissions. Lee [28 ] found insignificant effects of FDI on CO2 emissions in G20 nations. Moreover, negative association was found between GDP and CO2 emissions. G20 countries are already developed and FDI may not further improve air quality. Pao and Tsai [29 ] conducted a research work for BRICS and found that FDI contributes to more air pollution, which suggested the scrutinizing of FDI inflows to reduce their negative climatic effects. Similarly, different studies have found diverge results [30 ,31 ]. A lot work has been done regarding the importance of education and environmental awareness in different regions of the world [32 ,33 ]. For example Ramírez [34 ] conduct a work regarding the association of education and biodiversity preservation. Moreover, Ketlhoilwe [35 ] found the association of climatic awareness and disaster risk management. To the best of our knowledge, there are very few research studies, which investigated the linkages of education and CO2 emissions. This association grants an opening to seek deeper evidence into the associations of environmental awareness to achieve sustainable development especially in developing nations, where education level is developing with higher environmental pollution. Available literature provides evidence about positive role of renewable energy in creating economic growth but there is also contradictory work, which revealed the importance of non-renewable energy sources for economic growth. Moreover, it is now debated that education can be an important factor that can help to establish clean energy sources in developed and developing nations [36–38 ]. In the context of developing countries, it is very important to find the impact of education attainment to mitigate environmental pollution. Therefore, this work is important to provide novel policy tools by incorporating education awareness to achieve sustainable development.  1.2 Theoretical background Theoretical background provides concrete support for empirical analysis, therefore it is important to mention past available literature for theoretical justification. G11 countries are mostly developing countries, which are consuming more energy to achieve higher economic growth. With the passage of time, these countries are also in efforts to bring green technologies in their total energy consumption pattern. Despite of all efforts to use green energies, these nations are still at the stake of environmental pollution. G11 countries are rich in terms of natural resources and the utilization of natural resources may not be sustainable. Due to the hydro carbonized structure of these natural resources, the consumption may generate more CO2 emissions. Therefore, excess of natural resource utilization may deteriorate environmental quality. Moreover, most of these nations are relying on traditional technologies for energy consumption. To attract more FDI, these countries may compromise on environmental quality [15 ]. In this context, the role of education awareness to improve air quality is important to discuss. After a threshold level of economic growth, air quality starts to improve due to environmental awareness. This process takes place due to the higher level of education, which increase the conscious level of the people about their surroundings and they start to show concerns about environmental quality. People start to pressurize the policy-making bodies for effective policy instruments for cleaner environment. This entire process is initiated by education. In this regards, public and private institutions should come forward to create environmental awareness among the people. In doing so, education system has to be upgraded with the targets of ecological sustainable principles. Therefore, along with educational improvements, the environmental awareness lessons should also be included in secondary and high school curriculums so that citizens can obtain basic idea about environmental protection issues. Hence, environmental awareness can be achieved through the channels of education. Succinctly, along with the scale effects of FDI and natural resources, renewable energy exacts its compositional impacts with technical effects of education on environmental quality. Hence, the role of renewable energy and education is expected to curb the adverse impacts of CO2 emissions whereas natural resources, FDI and economic growth may have assertive effects on CO2 emissions.  1.3 Model specification and data In an effort to analyze the impacts of education (ED), Natural resources (NA), foreign direct investment (FDI), renewable energy consumption (RE) on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, we include GDP as controlling factor. The econometric equation is as follows:(1) C O 2  =  F ( E D , G , F D I , N A , R E )  E n F D I c  e q u a t i o n  i s  a s  f o l l o w s :  r o w t h  m a y  h a v e  a s s e r t i v e  r o l e  d u c a t i o n .  o u l d  a l s o  b e  i n c l u d e d  i n  sec  o n d a r y  a n d  h i g h  s c h o o l  c      To ensure normal distribution, we transformed the variables into their logarithmic form. Logarithmic form eliminates the problems of heteroskdasticity and autocorrelation problems. Moreover, logarithmic data provides robust results [39 ]. Therefore, logarithmic formed equation is as follows:(2) ln  C O 2 i t   =  β i 0    +  β 1     ln  E D U i t   +  β 2     ln  G i t   +  β 3     ln  F D I i t   + β 4     ln  N A i t   +  β 5   ln  R E i t   +  є i t       Where i represents the cross sections (1, ……29), t is the time period (1990–2019). β 1      shows the values of EDU, G, FDI, NA, and RE and є t     is the error term. In an effort to find the scale, compositional and technique effects of education, GDP, foreign direct investment, natural resources and renewable energy, we estimated equation in the context of EKC. We followed Panayotou [40 ] to find the impacts of independent variables by employing quadratic form of EKC. Under the EKC framework, except renewable energy, all variables are expected to degrade the environmental quality but after some threshold level these variables are expected to improve air quality. At the early stages of economic growth, nations do not care for the environment but later people start to show concern over environmental quality. This is the time, when governments start to formulate environmental policies by attracting FDI and utilize natural resources, which increase professional opportunities. This phenomenon may explain the scale effects of FDI on environmental quality. Rise in professional activities, further increases education attainment. Higher priority for education attainment may oversee the environmental protection. Therefore, sequester education policy leads to deteriorate environmental quality. Hence, in this scenario, the reckless utilization of natural resources in industrial units further degrades the environment. This mechanism also shows the scale effects of education and natural resources on environmental quality. In this context, when GDP reaches at threshold level, education also starts to enhance the awareness level of the people. The transformation of education from vocational activities to environmental awareness can be explained by the scale effect of education to technique effect of education towards environmental quality. This phenomena can be explained by the square term of education. Therefore, at this point rise in education further improve the environmental quality. This becomes the point when further economic growth and FDI exacts lower impacts on climatic quality, this phenomena is explained by the square term of FDI. Further, during this period, due to public awareness, attention is diverted to preserve natural resources by efficient means of production. Therefore, natural resources start to increased, which lower the environmental degradation. This mechanism can be explained mathematically by square term of natural resources. This phenomena is important in terms of G11 countries, where economic activities are increasing and environment is degrading rapidly. The non linear equation for EKC is given below:(3) l n C O 2 i t   =  β i 0    +  β 1    l n E D U i t   + β 2    l n E D U i t  2  +  β 3    l n G i t   + β 4    l n G i t  2  +  β 5    l n F D I i t   + β 6    l n F D I i t  2  + β 7    l n N A i t   + β 8    l n N A i t  2  +  β 9  l n R E i t   +  є i t        This study attempts to investigate the linkages of education, GDP, FDI, natural resources, renewable energy and CO2 emissions in G11 member countries: countries over the annual data of 1990–2019. We included following countries of G11: Croatia, Jordan, Georgia, Honduras, Morocco, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Paraguay, El Salvador and Ecuador. CO2 emissions are in per capita, GDP per capita (G), natural resources (NA), FDI and renewable energy (RE) is as % age of total energy production. We included secondary education enrollment as indicator for education (ED). Secondary level education is sufficient to understand the climatic pollution and take essential measures. All data is obtained from world data indicators [15 ].  1.4 Cross sectional dependence test Panel data may suffer from cross section dependence (CD), which cannot provide robust results [41 ]. Due to economic, social and cultural ties, countries may depend on one another. This interdependent among countries creates CD. Therefore, to check CD, we applied CD test by Pesaran [42 ], and LM test by Breusch and Pagan [43 ]. In this regards, following equation is used to check CD.(4) L M = T ∑  i = 1  n − 1   ∑  j = i + 1  n  ∂ i j  t      (5) C D = 2 T  N ( N − 1 )     ( ∑  i = 1  n − 1   ∑  j = i + 1  n  ∂ i j  t   )      Where T refers to the time span and N refers to the number of cross sections. ∂ i j  t     refers to the Pair wise correlation of errors between i and j. After examining the cross-section dependence, we conducted slope homogeneity test to check slope phenomenon. The existence of homogeneity among the panel data of countries can provide unreliable results [44 ]. The equations for Slope homogeneity tests of Δ ∼     and Δ adj ∼     are as follows:(6) Δ ∼  =  N  ( N − 1   S ∼  − K   2 K    )      (7) Δ adj ∼  =  N  ( N − 1   S ∼  − E  ( Z i T  ∼  )   v a r ( Z i T  ∼  )     )      Where E ( Z i T  ∼  )     = K and v a r ( Z i T  ∼  )     = 2K (T-K-1)/(T+1). The modified test of S ∼     can be applied by using the equation as follows:(8) S ∼   = ∑  i = 1  n  ( γ i ^  − γ W F E  ∼   )  Y i   ΄  M T  X i   ∅ i ∼ 2    ( γ i ^  − γ W F E  ∼   )      γ i ^     represents the value of pooled OLS test for individual unit. γ W F E  ∼     shows the weighted pooled estimator, M T     refers to identity matrix. After checking the slope homogeneity, the next step is to examine the order of integration among the variables as the existence of unit root among time series can give spurious results. We applied two types of unit root tests to check the stationarity properties of the variables. Therefore, a set of first generation unit root tests [45 ,46 ] and a set of second-generation unit root tests are applied to the data. If the unit root tests show the order of integration at level I(0) then simple regression of ordinary least square (OLS) can be applied but if the variables are co-integrated at first difference then it is compulsory to examine the co-integration among the variables. Here, instead of the co-integration techniques of [47–49 ], we applied Westerlund Edgerton [50 ] test, which consider the cross section dependence among the time series. After confirmation of co-integration among the estimated variables, we move forward to estimate the long run coefficients. For this purpose, we applied fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) techniques. The equations for these tests are given as:(9) γ F M O L S  ^  =  [ N − 1   ∑  i = 1  N  ( ∑  t = 1  t  ∪  i t   − ∪  i ∼   )  2   ]  − 1   ×  [ ( ∑  t = 1  T  ∪  i t   − ∪  i ∼   )  S i t  ^  − T Δ ε μ  ^   ]      (10) γ D O L S  ^  =  [ N − 1   ∑  i = 1  N  ( ∑  t = 1  T  ∁ i t   ∁ i t  ΄   )  − 1   ( ∑  t = 1  T  ∁ i t   ∁ i t  ΄   )   ]       This paper applied fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) techniques to find the long run coefficients. These tests are widely used in literature as they remove the autocorrelations and endogeneity problems. We applied test to uncover the causality between the variables. This test is efficient because it removes the problem of CS in the data.   2 Results and discussion The empirical estimation starts with checking for cross section dependence among panel data and Table 1   shows the CD test results. We present three coefficient results to verify the values. All three tests results provide evidence for cross section dependence among the data at 1% level. This dependence may be due to the economic and cultural dependence among the G11 countries. CD existence, further endorse the application of second generation unit root tests to check the order of integration among the variables. Therefore, we applied CADF and CIPS unit root tests, moreover we also applied first generation unit root test to compare the results. Tables 2 and 3    provide the results of first generation and second generation unit root test. After examination of unit root test results it was observed that some variables are integrated at level and some are stationary at first difference. After knowing the order of integration, we further applied Westerlund and Edgerton [50 ] to know if there exists co-integration among the estimated equation. Table 4   shows that CO2 emissions, education attainment, FDI, GDP, natural resources and renewable energy moves together in the long run at 1% level in G11 member nations for the period of 1990–2019. The subsequent step is to find the long run coefficients for individual impacts of independent variables. In this regards, we applied three different estimations namely: fully modifies ordinary least square (FMOLS), dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) and pool mean group (PMG) ARDL. The linear and non-linear long-run results are reported in Tables 5 and 6   . Firstly, we analyze linear relationship between estimated variables and it is observed that education exacts negative impacts on CO2 emissions by 0.11%. Education attainment creates environmental awareness and people start to pressurize the governmental organizations for effective climatic policy. Due to effective policy implementation, environmental quality starts to improve. Puukka [51 ] also found that education has enabled sustainable development in OECD economies. Our findings are also in line with Bano et al. [52 ], who found that education lowers environmental pollution. Due to policy change, governments start to utilize more renewable energy, which enhances the environmental quality. Our findings are similar with Danish et al. [53 ] in Pakistan and Sinha and Shahbaz [54 ] in India. Therefore, due to public pressure and in effort to attain sustainable goals, governments start to enhance the usage of renewable energy to lower CO2 emissions. Moreover, abundance of natural resources provide opportunities to the governments to utilize them to achieve higher economic development. The reckless use of natural resources will degrade the environment. Fossil fuel is also among the natural resources, which degrade the climatic quality by emitting greenhouse gases. Our findings are similar with Jebli et al. [55 ], for OECD. Due to higher economic growth, these countries focused on industrial production, which accompanied by FDI. In this respect, FDI is improving air quality in G11 countries. These results are in line with [56 ,57 ]. In the light of empirical evidence, G11 countries need to consider these factors to achieve SDGs. G11 countries are mostly developing and aim to cooperate economically with one another to lower their debt. In these efforts, these countries need to consider their environmental policies for sustainable development. Next, quadratic equation will be analyzed and results are in Table 6 . The coefficients of education and its square term are positive and negative respectively, which is validating EKC hypothesis between education and CO2 emissions. As the education level rises, it further stimulates vocational activities. Professional activities further enhance energy requirements and creating environmental problems. However, the rise in economic growth further enhances education level of the people and they start to care more for their environment. Public awareness further demands for cleaner energy utilization, which improves air quality. This outcome is same as Balaguer and Cantavella [58 ], for Australia but contradict with the findings of Jiang [59 ], who did not find inverted U type association between education and CO2 in China. In the case of FDI, positive and then negative linkages are found between FDI and its square term. This result confirmed EKC between FDI and CO2 in G11 countries. This outcome shows that in these developing nations, FDI is degrading the environment due to huge industrial outputs by fossil fuel consumption but later FDI will start to enhance air quality by importing efficient technologies. This result is in line with Bano et al. [60 ] for China. There exist positive and negative linkages between GDP and its square term, which is validating EKC in G11 nations. At the early stages of economic growth the relying on fossil fuels, deteriorate air quality. After reaching at some threshold level, GDP starts to improve air quality. Due to education and climatic awareness, public demand for cleaner technologies, which reduce the concentration of CO2 emissions. These findings highlight the sustainable path for G11 nations. This findings holds same results as [56 ,61 ] in Latin America and India respectively. Next, we analyzed the impacts of natural resources on CO2 emissions. It was revealed that natural resources and its square term are linked positively and negatively and confirming EKC. Abundant natural resources compel the governments to utilize them to achieve economic growth. At this point CO2 emissions start to rise rapidly. Due to rise in GDP and education awareness, the usage of natural resources lowers. At this point, with the rise of natural resources, air quality starts to improve. Lastly, renewable energy is seen to improve air quality significantly. This finding is consistent with Sinha and Shahbaz [61 ] in India but contradict with Farhani and Shahbaz [62 ] in African nations. Lastly, we conducted causality analysis and results are in Table 7  . This test is compulsory because policy implications are mostly bidirectional [63 ]. Therefore, for effective policy instruments, causality test holds strong implications. We applied Dumetrescu and Hurlin [64 ], which consider heterogeneous properties of variables and results are in Table 7 . Bidirectional causality exists between education and CO2 emissions. Bano et al. [52 ] also found feedback causality between human capital and CO2 emissions. Bidirectional causality is found between FDI and CO2 emissions. Seker [65 ] also found one-way causality between FDI and CO2 emissions. Bidirectional causality holds between CO2 and GDP same as [66 ] found one-way causality from GDP to CO2 emissions. At the same time, feedback causality is found between natural resources, renewable energy and CO2 emissions. 2.1 Suggestion for sustainable development This work aims to provide suggestions for sustainable development in G11 member countries by presenting long run and causal effects among different variables. We find that education improves air quality and has feedback causal effect on CO2 emissions. This finding provides policy implications for sustainable development in G11 nations. Education enables the nation to know about environmental problems and to respond accordingly. Moreover, education awareness creates room for innovative technologies for cleaner production. These innovative technologies provides cleaner environment with employment opportunities [67 ]. Therefore, SDGs of quality education, sustainable professional activities, industrial innovations and climate action can be fulfilled. In the light of efficient energy policies in G11 nations, the associations of education, renewable energy and CO2 emissions provide crucial instruments. With the rise in education attainment, renewable energy consumption also increases, which shows the trend of nations to go for clean energy solutions. As already noticed that GDP causes renewable energy because fossil fuels degrade the air quality but renewable energy provides alternative sustainable energies. Therefore, it is imperative for policy makers to move from fossil fuels to clean energies in phase wise manner. Moreover, during this transition from fossils to clean energies, the channels of education awareness can preserve natural resources from further depletion. Through this line of action, the role of education attainment is vital to attain SDGs of (7,4,13,12)  for clean energy, education, climate action and clean energy consumption. At the same time, in the efforts to provide quality education and to bring innovations in efficient technologies, G11 nations should not rely on imported technologies through FDI because domestic technologies will survive through research and development. Moreover, lower reliance on FDI will provide the governments to have control over available natural resources, which will enhance the natural resources. In this line, it is important for policy makers to preserve public properties effectively along with cleaner technologies in domestic channels.   3 Conclusion From the last few decades, world's economies are struggling to achieve cleaner environment without hurting economic growth. In this regard, different economic and social factors can play effective role. This empirical research investigates the impacts of education, FDI, natural resources, GDP and renewable energy use on CO2 emissions in G11 nations over the period of 1990–2019. This study applied first and second generation unit root tests to form policy instruments for sustainable development. The findings of this work have suggested the policies of the usage of renewable energy and educational awareness to lower CO2 emissions. Through this route, the SDGs of 7,13 and 4 will be achieved. Therefore, this work has contributed to current wave of knowledge by providing the multiple channels to achieve sustainable goals. Following are the tentative policy instruments. Education has negative impacts on CO2 emissions, which shows that G11 nations can improve air quality by increasing education awareness through education sector. By including environmental benefits and energy efficiency in curriculum, governments can create environmental awareness, which will create a social behavior to save energy for sustainable environment. In this line, curriculum should be designed in such a way that educational awareness prevails before the vocational activities of the people. This will strengthen public private partnerships, which will lower the impacts of FDI on air quality. G11 nations have to incentivized the FDI only to bring cleaner technologies for energy production and consumption. Moreover, economic incentives should be given to organizations for the usage of clean technologies. Policy makers have to move from fossil consumption to clean energies in phase wise manners because it can hurt the economic growth. Here, the role of education awareness will work efficiently to support environmental policies. Therefore, G11 nations should have to increase their educational budget. Apart from the contribution of this work, there are some limitations, which can be filled by future studies. This work conducted panel estimations and future research can be conducted on individual countries by considering structural breaks. Moreover, future studies can apply quintile approach to provide policy implications at deeper level.  Ethical approval Not required.  Consent to publish Not Applicable.
