                  The objective of this study is twofold. First, it aims to bridge a significant gap in the existing literature by reviewing the integration of waste heat recovery (WHR) into polygeneration systems. Thus, it scrutinizes the methods and challenges of WHR-based polygeneration systems and explores their energy and economic potential based on data gathered from the literature and using key indicators. Second, it addresses the scarcity of existing studies assessing the environmental impact of these systems. Therefore, an environmental analysis is conducted to evaluate the potential mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions achievable through their implementation. The findings of the study reveal significant energy and exergy efficiencies, varying in the ranges of 20.8 %–96.9 % and 24.1 %–63.6 %, respectively, proving high performance of WHR-based polygeneration systems. Economically, these systems exhibit competitiveness, with short payback periods ranging from 1.4 to 6.7 years, along with average levelized costs of electricity, cooling, and heating of 0.17, 0.37 and 0.13 $/kWh, sequentially. Moreover, the environmental assessment confirmed substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, reaching on average 2.45 kt of carbon dioxide per MW of installed capacity, annually. The study could contribute to raising awareness regarding the energy, economic, and environmental benefits of WHR-based polygeneration systems, thereby fostering the widespread adoption of these sustainable systems.

Editor: Kuishuang Feng The objective of this study is twofold. First, it aims to bridge a significant gap in the existing literature by reviewing the integration of waste heat recovery (WHR) into polygeneration systems. Thus, it scrutinizes the methods and challenges of WHR-based polygeneration systems and explores their energy and economic potential based on data gathered from the literature and using key indicators. Second, it addresses the scarcity of existing studies assessing the environmental impact of these systems. Therefore, an environmental analysis is conducted to evaluate the potential mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions achievable through their implementation. The findings of the study reveal significant energy and exergy efficiencies, varying in the ranges of 20.8 %–96.9 % and 24.1 %–63.6 %, respectively, proving high performance of WHR-based polygeneration systems. Economically, these systems exhibit competitiveness, with short payback periods ranging from 1.4 to 6.7 years, along with average levelized costs of electricity, cooling, and heating of 0.17, 0.37 and 0.13 $/kWh, sequentially. Moreover, the environmental assessment confirmed substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, reaching on average 2.45 kt of carbon dioxide per MW of installed capacity, annually. The study could contribute to raising awareness regarding the energy, economic, and environmental benefits of WHR-based polygeneration systems, thereby fostering the widespread adoption of these sustainable systems.

Unfortunately, the current reliance on fossil fuels for global energy production not only depletes natural resources but also emits greenhouse gases (GHG), exacerbating global warming (M.R. and Ritchie, n.d. ). Although the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a historic decline in energy consumption (IEA, 2023 ), the subsequent easing of restrictions and widespread vaccination campaigns have propelled the global economy back to its pre-pandemic levels, driving up energy demand again. However, the world now faces a pressing energy crisis, primarily triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, impacting energy markets and geopolitics, resulting in a surge in oil and gas prices, compelling nations to reassess their energy supplies (Chowdhury et al., 2023 ). In light of these challenges, it is imperative for the international community to ensure a stable and sustainable energy supply, while also prioritizing the implementation of decarbonization policies. This can be achieved through the promotion of global energy transition and fostering clean energy technologies. In this respect, polygeneration technologies have emerged as a compelling and sustainable energy solution, offering several advantages over traditional stand-alone units. A pivotal feature of polygeneration lies in its ability to generate multiple outputs from a single unit, including power, heating, domestic hot water (DHW), cooling, freshwater production, as well as the production of chemical and energy products (Calise et al., 2022 ). Despite extensive discussions and analyses conducted in recent years, widespread commercial implementation of polygeneration systems remains limited due to their inherent complexity. However, appropriately designed systems can reduce carbon footprints and energy waste, while addressing fossil resource scarcity issue, enhancing energy efficiency in different sectors, and boosting economic benefits. In the literature, for instance, Mehr et al. (2021)  emphasized the importance of polygeneration systems in meeting various energy needs while addressing environmental concerns, such as fossil fuel exploitation and global warming. Their research focused on high-temperature fuel cell systems like solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs). It aimed at exploring advanced technologies using fuels such as pure hydrogen, natural gas, and biogas. By integrating these fuel cells with gas turbines and steam power systems, simultaneous electricity generation and diverse by-product production were achieved. In a similar vein, Rejeb et al. (2022)  introduced a multi-generation system integrating various renewable energy technologies, including concentrated photovoltaic/thermal (CPVT), organic Rankine cycle (ORC), liquefied natural gas (LNG), and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer systems for hydrogen, oxygen, electricity, and heat production. The researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis, evaluating the system's thermodynamic performance, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. The results showed an exergy efficiency of 16.24 %, a cost rate of 4.48 $/h, and a net electrical power output of 33.32 kW under optimal conditions. Specific meteorological conditions, like those in Tehran, yielded 140.8 kW of thermal power, 22.5 kW of electrical power, and 97.3 g/l of hydrogen. Similarly, Esmaeilion et al. (2023)  investigated a polygeneration system incorporating liquid air energy storage (LAES), a multi-stage flash (MSF) desalination system, and a combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP) system. The aim was to produce electrical energy, heating, cooling, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen, and freshwater. Notable efficiencies of 63.6 % and 61 % for energy and exergy, respectively, were achieved. The system demonstrated substantial annual production of hydrogen, potable water, and sodium hypochlorite, reaching 10.2 × 105  m3 , 4800 m3 , and 43.2 tons, respectively. Economically, it exhibited a promising profile, with a payback period of 3.4 years and an internal rate of return of 0.32, emphasizing its economic viability. Additionally, the exergoenvironmental study revealed the system's environmental impact through factors such as the environmental damage effectiveness, exergoenvironmental and exergy stability factors, and the sustainability index, with values of 3.43, 1.68, 0.7, and 1.96, respectively. Improving the efficiency of polygeneration systems presents a promising avenue by capitalizing on the recovery of waste heat to generate multiple utility outputs, as evidenced by numerous research studies. In a notable contribution by Aridi et al. (2023a) , attention was drawn to a novel heat recovery system targeting the retrieval of thermal energy lost from grey water, encompassing wastewater from dishwashers, washing machines and showers, to reheat the cold water supply entering the building. This system, incorporating a vortex generator-based heat exchanger and a multi-drain water application, was employed in 48 accommodations. The findings showed a significant temperature increase of between 3.5 and 7.5 °C in the cold-water supply, leading to substantial daily environmental and economic savings across various energy sources such as gas, diesel, coal, and electricity. Building upon this initial investigation, Aridi et al. (2023b)  quantified the economic and environmental impacts of this design when paired with diverse renewable energy sources. Their study revealed significant environmental cost savings attributed to renewable energy sources including solar, wind, biomass, hydropower, alongside a pumped storage, which were found to yield savings estimated at 0.783, 0.339, 0.141, 0.027, and 1.356 € per day, respectively. Waste heat refers to the thermal energy generated during various industrial processes and is often discarded into the atmosphere without utilization. To optimize its potential, waste heat can be categorized into three distinct temperature levels. Firstly, high-temperature waste heat encompasses thermal losses exceeding 400 °C. The second category is medium-temperature waste heat, encompassing losses ranging between 100 and 400 °C. Finally, the third category is low-temperature waste heat, involving losses occurring below 100 °C (Brückner et al., 2015 ). Various waste heat recovery (WHR) processes can be employed to harness this valuable energy resource, including heat exchangers (Sajjad et al., 2024 ; Geum et al., 2024 ), ORC (Wang et al., 2022a ; Wang et al., 2024 ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Altayib and Dincer, 2022 ; Kasaeian et al., 2022 ), Kalina cycle (KC) (Shokri Kalan et al., 2023 ), organic flash cycle (OFC) (Wang et al., 2022a ), and ejector refrigeration cycle (ERC) (Kasaeian et al., 2022 ), among others. These technologies, which are classified based on the type and temperature range of waste heat, effectively capture and convert heat into multiple forms of energy utilities. Although WHR is a promising energy source for polygeneration, it still faces challenges and limitations (Jouhara et al., 2018 ). One primary challenge is the initial investment required for installing WHR systems, as they tend to be bulky and complex. However, long-term advantages, such as energy savings and reduced GHG emissions, can outweigh the upfront expenses. The heat quality is another important limitation, particularly for low-temperature waste heat. Such waste heat requires additional components to improve its quality and make it suitable for effective utilization. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to these requirements when harnessing low-temperature waste heat using polygeneration systems. Furthermore, when recovering waste heat at higher temperatures, larger heat exchangers are often required, leading to increased capital costs. Hence, selecting appropriate WHR systems, materials, and working fluids based on specific applications and temperature ranges is crucial for optimizing the overall performance of the system. Lastly, addressing the temperature outlet restrictions associated with exhaust gas WHR is crucial. Neglecting these restrictions could lead to safety hazards, thus; it is imperative to prioritize proper design and operation to guarantee the efficient and secure functioning of WHR systems.  1.2 Objective and contributions After a thorough review of the current literature, it is evident that a significant gap persists in the research concerning polygeneration systems incorporating WHR. Despite the growing interest in both WHR and polygeneration individually, there is still a notable lack of comprehensive reviews exploring the integration of these technologies. This gap is highlighted by the limited number of holistic analyses in the existing literature, as illustrated in Fig. 1  . This figure shows the publication trends of review papers on WHR systems, polygeneration systems, and their combination, from 2010 to 2023. From this figure, it is obvious that almost all previous works focused on either WHR or polygeneration separately, and there is a conspicuous gap in the literature regarding a comprehensive review specifically focusing on the integration of WHR into polygeneration systems. For instance, Aridi et al. (2022)  conducted a review aimed at providing insights into Hybrid Heat Recovery (HHR) systems, comparing them with conventional recovery systems, and assessing the enhancements against the added complexities of hybrid systems. Similarly, Farhat et al. (2022)  offered a thorough review of waste heat recovery methodologies and applications across various fields, such as residential buildings, industrial processes, and internal combustion engines. DeLovato et al. (2019)  conducted a review exploring diverse approaches to WHR from CSP-based plants, utilizing excess heat generated during electricity production for various applications such as desalination, CCHP systems, phase change material-enhanced systems, and combined photovoltaic thermal (PVT) systems, predominantly focusing on the combination of WHR techniques with CSP plants to efficiently meet future power demands. However, their study did not focus on the integration of WHR into polygeneration systems. Therefore, this research aims to fill this gap by undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on WHR-integrated polygeneration systems, aiming to determine the potential of WHR in polygeneration applications. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the environmental impact of WHR-based polygeneration systems has not been explored in prior studies. Thus, this study endeavors to shed light on this aspect by elucidating the energy, exergy, economic, and environmental (4E) potential of heat recovery-based polygeneration, thereby providing insights into both the technical feasibility and environmental sustainability of these systems. By addressing these crucial aspects, this research aims to significantly contribute to the understanding and advancement of sustainable energy systems. This article is structured into five sections to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Firstly, Section 1  offers a brief introduction to the energy context and provides an overview of polygeneration and WHR systems while discussing the limitations, recent advancements, and challenges associated with these systems. Section 2  outlines the metrics employed to assess the performance of WHR-based cogeneration and polygeneration systems. By identifying and discussing these evaluation criteria, this section highlights the key parameters used to gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of these systems. Section 3  presents a thorough review of relevant studies pertaining to waste heat in the cogeneration and polygeneration processes. By synthesizing existing research, this section offers insights into the current state of knowledge in the field and identifies the challenges that need to be addressed. Furthermore, Section 4  introduces a performance approach that examines existing research on WHR-based polygeneration and cogeneration systems. In addition, it presents and analyzes 4E evaluation results from other researchers found in the literature, as well as the outcomes obtained from the author's own analysis. By integrating diverse sources of information, this section provides an overview of the potential of these systems, supported by empirical evidence. Finally, Section 5  concludes the article by summarizing the key findings and insights. Additionally, it provides recommendations for future research directions, identifying areas that require further investigation to enhance the understanding and implementation of WHR-based polygeneration systems.   2 Performance indicators In this section, the various indicators employed to evaluate the effectiveness of cogeneration and polygeneration systems are discussed. Performance indicators play a crucial role in ensuring the efficient and environmentally friendly design and operation of these systems, while also facilitating their improvement and optimization. Table 1   lists the key indicators used in the literature to evaluate WHR-based polygeneration technologies. These indicators are categorized into three fundamental aspects: energy, economic, and environmental. 2.1 Energy indicators When evaluating the energy performance of polygeneration systems operating under steady-state conditions, two metrics are commonly adopted, namely the energy utilization factor (EUF) and the primary energy saving ratio (PESR) (Jannelli et al., 2014 ). The EUF is defined as the ratio of the total useful inputs delivered to customers to the thermal power supplied to the polygeneration system through WHR, providing a direct comparison of systems' performances. It is expressed by the following equation (Shao et al., 2023 ).(1) EUF = λ el  + λ th     in which λ el   and λ th   denote the electrical and thermal efficiencies, respectively, as defined by Eq. (2)  and Eq. (3) .(2) λ el  = W Q wh      (3) λ th  = Q u  Q wh      where Q wh   represents the exhaust waste heat supplied to the polygeneration system, W denotes the power production from this system, and Q u   designates the thermal energy production. The second indicator, PESR, assesses the energy-saving potential of polygeneration system compared to a conventional system that produces energy separately. The PESR is calculated using Eq. (4)  (Wang et al., 2021a ), under the assumption that both systems deliver equal outputs to the end-user.(4) PESR = 1 − ∑ t = 1  τ  PE C poly  t   ∑ t = 1  τ  PE C CS  t       in which τ   denotes the annual operational hours of the system, PECpoly  and PECCS  represent the primary energy consumption (PEC) of the polygeneration and conventional systems, respectively. A positive PESR value indicates that the polygeneration system is capable of achieving energy savings by requiring less thermal energy from the heat source than the conventional system. Another crucial aspect in assessing system performance is energy efficiency, which is determined as the ratio of the practical energy demands of the system end-user to the energy inputs required to operate it (Lior and Zhang, 2007 ). Generally, the energy efficiency of a polygeneration system is defined by means of Eq. (5) .(5) η e  = W net  + ∑ Q output   Q wh      in which ∑ Q output    represents the thermal energy outputs from various processes within the polygeneration system, and Wnet  denotes the net work output of the polygeneration system. Furthermore, exergy efficiency (η ex,sys  ) refers to the ratio of the total useful exergy output to the total exergy input of the system (Zhang and Liu, 2023 ). It is given by Eq. (6) .(6)  η ex  = ∑ E .  χ output    ∑ E .  χ input        where ∑ E .  χ output     represents the total sum of the exergy values of the system outputs, while ∑ E .  χ input     signifies the total sum exergy values of the system inputs, namely, the exhaust waste heat. In addition, the coefficient of performance (COP) serves as a crucial metric for assessing system efficiency. It quantifies the ratio of the produced energy to the thermal energy supplied to the system. This parameter can be expressed by means of Eq. (7)  (Xue et al., 2021 ).(7) COP = Q i  E input      where Q i   represents the useful output from a specific process (i ) within the polygeneration system, which can be power, cooling, heating, or freshwater, etc. depending on the system's specific functionalities. E input   represents the energy input required to operate the specific process.  2.2 Economic assessment In the current study, the financial evaluation of the studied systems particularly focuses on vital parameters in investment analysis, namely the simple payback period (SPP) and the discount payback period (DPP). The SPP represents the time required to recover the initial investment. The general expression for the SPP is given by Eq. (8)  (Elaouzy and El Fadar, 2022 ).(8) SPP = C 0  C F      where C 0   and CF  represent the capital cost and yearly cash flow, respectively. To calculate the capital cost, the investment costs of all subsystems of the installation are summed. The annual cash flow can be obtained using Eq. (9)  (Ogbu et al., 2023 ):(9) C F  = E i   × C i   − C O & M i       in which E (i)   is the net generated energy accumulated over a year, expressed in kWh, C (i)   corresponds to the respective cost of the produced energy ($/kWh), and CO&M(i)  refers to the annual operation and maintenance cost ($), taken to be 1 % of the capital cost. This assumption is adopted based on a comprehensive review of the literature on similar polygeneration systems, where numerous studies, (Zarei et al., 2021a ; Bellos and Tzivanidis, 2021 ; Bellos et al., 2018 ) have assumed this value. Moreover, the DPP denotes the time required for recovering the initial investment, considering the present value of future cash inflows. This can be calculated by means of Eq. (10)  as follows (Ahmadi et al., 2021 ):(10) DPP = ln C F  C F  − r × C 0      ln 1 + r        where r  refers to the discount factor. In addition, the evaluation of energy conversion systems' cost-effectiveness and economic feasibility heavily relies on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). As a key indicator, LCOE enables the comparison of different systems. It can be calculated using Eq. (11)  (Ampah et al., 2023 ):(11) LCOE =  C Total   τ × P net       in which P net   indicates the net power output, expressed in kilowatts (kW), while τ   denotes the number of annual operating hours (h). Additionally, C Total   signifies the total annual cost, which can be calculated using Eq. (12)  (Seyyedvalilu et al., 2021 ):(12) C Total  = CRF × ζ × C 0       where ζ  represents the maintenance factor and CRF denotes the capital recovery factor, converting the current capital equipment cost into an annualized cost, which is expressed by Eq. (13)  (Khani et al., 2022 ).(13) CRF =  i r   1 + i r    n   1 + i r    n  − 1      where i r   and n  designate the interest rate and the system's lifespan, respectively. The levelized cost of cooling or heating (LCOC or LCOH) can be defined by means of Eq. (14)  or Eq. (15)  (Seyyedvalilu et al., 2021 ):(14) LCOC =  C Total   τ × Q net , cooling        (15) LCOH =  C Total   τ × Q net , heating        where Qnet,cooling  and Qnet,heating  denote, respectively, the net cooling and heating outputs of the polygeneration system, expressed in kW. The net present value (NPV) holds significant importance in economic analysis as it enables the comparison between cash inflows and cash outflows over a specified period. By accounting for inflation and returns through the discount rate (Ghoreishinejad et al., 2023 ), NPV quantifies the profitability of an investment, as defined in Eq. (16) .(16) NPV = − C 0  + ∑ t = 0  n  C F  1 + r   t       Furthermore, the internal rate of return (IRR) is another key indicator utilized to assess the investment profitability. It can be expressed by means of Eq. (17)  as follows (Zarei et al., 2021b ):(17) IRR = C F  C 0   1 − 1 1 + r   n         The assessment of economic profitability in polygeneration systems often involves using the savings-to-investment ratio (SIR) as a pivotal metric. The SIR is calculated by comparing the cumulative savings generated throughout the system's lifespan to the initial investment, as defined by Eq. (18)  (Elaouzy and El Fadar, 2023b ).(18) SIR = ∑ t = 0  n  S t  1 + r   t    ∑ t = 0  n  I t  1 + r   t        in which S t   and I t   represent, sequentially, the savings and investment in the t-th year.  2.3 Environmental indicators As for environmental indicators, saved GHG emissions and environmental cost savings (ECS) have been adopted to evaluate the environmental benefits of polygeneration systems. The annual GHG emission savings by using the polygeneration system, compared to the conventional system (CS) for the same heating, cooling, and power demands, can be assessed by means of Eq. (19) .(19) GHG saved  = GHG CS  − GHG Poly       The GHG emissions from polygeneration and CS are defined by Eq. (20)  and Eq. (21)  (AlNouss et al., 2018 ):(20) GHG Poly  = E F Poly  × AE P Poly     (21) GHG CS  = E F CS  × AE P CS     where AEP is the annual energy production and EF demotes the CO2  emissions factor expressed in gCO2 _eq per kWh. Furthermore, the ECS can be quantified using Eq. (22)  (El Marazgioui and El Fadar, 2022 ), in which P carbon   denotes the carbon price.(22) ECS = GH G Saved  × P carbon      The CO2  emission reduction ratio (CO2 ERR) is another vital indicator used to evaluate the environmental impacts of energy systems; it is calculated as (Su et al., 2018 ):(23) C O 2  ERR = 1 − C O 2  Epoly  C O 2  Ecs      where CO2 Epoly and CO2 Ecs represent the carbon dioxide emissions from the polygeneration and conventional systems, respectively.   3 Previous studies on WHR-based polygeneration In this section, we delve into a thorough exploration of relevant studies that have shed light on the efficient and sustainable utilization of waste heat within cogeneration and polygeneration systems. The aim is to gain a profound understanding of the strategies employed to harness the vast potential of WHR from engines and industrial facilities. 3.1 Engine WHR-based cogeneration and polygeneration Engines, including internal combustion engines (ICEs) and gas turbines (GTs), are major consumers of fossil fuels, with a significant portion of the fuel energy being wasted through heat losses, exhaust gases, and lubrication oil, accounting for 55 % to 70 % of the total fuel energy (Liang et al., 2019 ). Recognizing the potential for significant energy savings, researchers have focused on WHR systems. These systems aim to capture and reuse engine waste heat through cogeneration or polygeneration approaches, thereby reducing fuel consumption and GHG emissions. In the literature, numerous studies have been dedicated to enhancing the efficiency and evaluating the economic viability of cogeneration and polygeneration systems that harness the waste heat generated by conventional heat engines. For instance, Liu et al. (2020)  conducted research on a novel cogeneration system for recovering waste heat from exhaust gases (EGs) and jacket cooling water (JCW) from marine engines (MEs). The WHR system, comprising a steam Rankine cycle (SRC), ORC, and absorption refrigeration cycle (ARC), increased the engine's thermal efficiency by 10.5 %, generating 7620 kW of electricity and 2940 kW of cooling. Similarly, Zoghi et al. (2019)  explored a trigeneration system using diesel exhaust gas, consisting of an ORC, DHW heat exchanger (DHWHX), and absorption-compression cooling and power system (ACCPS). According to the energy and exergoeconomic analyses, the steam quality at the expander inlet directly impacted the performance of the ACCPS. Furthermore, increasing the steam quality led to decreased energy efficiency and COP of the ACCPS. However, the system exhibited a significant 18.23 % increase in total power generation and a 3 % improvement in total exergy efficiency. This implies that optimizing different system parameters can improve specific aspects of the performance while potentially compromising others. This study shed light on the complex dynamics between system parameters and performance indicators within a trigeneration system. Moreover, it emphasized the importance of meticulous optimization and the balancing of various factors to achieve the desired outcomes. Another utilization of ICE waste heat was realized by Liang et al. (2018) , who combined ARC and SRC systems to recuperate heat from marine engines' exhaust gas, thereby generating electricity and cooling energy. Through comprehensive optimization using engineering equation solver (EES), the authors identified the key parameters for maximizing the model's electricity generation. Specifically, setting the SRC evaporation pressure at 120 °C resulted in a peak equivalent electricity output of 5223 kW. This highlights the effectiveness of waste heat recovery in significantly enhancing ship's energy efficiency by providing a substantial portion of its electrical energy needs. Parsa et al. (2021)  developed a trigeneration system fueled by biomass, capable of generating power, heat, and hydrogen. The system employed an ORC and a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine, along with a biomass gasifier using exhaust gases from the HCCI engine for heat generation. This system notably improved the energy efficiency from 38 % to 57 %. Alongside with ICEs, gas turbines of different sizes and applications have been extensively used, owing to their potential in WHR-based polygeneration or cogeneration systems. For example, Rafat and Babaelahi (2020)  investigated the potential of WHR from a hybrid solar GT power plant for electricity and freshwater production. Three scenarios were compared: KC, multi-effect desalination (MED) system, and Kalina/MED cycle. The third case, employing both the KC and desalination units, demonstrated the most promising results, with an 11.4 % increase in energy efficiency and a 6.02 % increase in exergy efficiency. Notably, the scenario using only the desalination unit achieved the highest economic and ecological ratings of 87.25 % and 88.11 %, respectively. Similarly, Zare et al. (2012)  investigated the thermodynamic feasibility of a combined cycle using an ammonia-water mixture integrating KC and ARC powered by waste heat from a gas turbine-modular helium reactor (GT-MHR). The combined cycle showed an EUF ranging from 9 % to 15 % and a second law efficiency of 10 %–41 %, under near-optimal conditions, surpassing those of the GT-MHR cycle. In a recent study by Wang et al. (2020) , an exergoeconomic analysis of a CCHP system, comprising a gas turbine cycle (GTC), regenerative supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2 ) Brayton cycle, ORC, and ARC, revealed remarkable results, yielding 40.65 MW of net power, 6.02 MW of cooling, and 9.93 MW of heating. The system achieved an impressive overall exergoeconomic factor of 20.17 %. Furthermore, in a different study, Li et al. (2020a)  developed a CCHP system that utilized waste heat from a MWe-class gas turbine through a carbon dioxide power cycle, an absorption chiller, and heaters. Thermodynamic and economic evaluations revealed that this CCHP system outperformed standalone power cycle, achieving a 4.62 % higher exergy efficiency and a reduction of 0.90 cent in the levelized cost of exergy (LCOEx). These results emphasized the benefits of integrating WHR technologies into CCHP systems, thereby enhancing both the overall efficiency and economic performance. In the same vein, Chen and Chua (2022)  explored a multigeneration system utilizing excess heat from a GT through a temperature-cascading WHR system. This system recovered 71 % of dissipated waste heat, resulting in a payback period of approximately 1.1 years and a reduction of 256 tons of CO2  emissions annually compared to a traditional system. Another efficiency-contributing prime mover in polygeneration systems is the fuel cell (FC). For example, Ramadhani et al. (2020)  explored a SOFC-based polygeneration system with integrated solar PVT and thermoelectric generators (TEG) for a typical Malaysian residential application. The system achieved an efficiency of 11.38 %, surpassing the basic system's performance and leading to substantial reductions in carbon emissions of 31.60 % and 30.32 % compared to the polygeneration-based basic system and the conventional system, respectively.  3.2 Industrial WHR-based cogeneration and polygeneration Research works conducted on industrial WHR have aimed to improve the production process efficiency, mitigate greenhouse gases, and decrease fuel consumption. For instance, Nami and Anvari-Moghaddam (2020)  explored waste heat utilization from a Turkish cement plant in two CCHP configurations. Their study identified a CCHP system with an ORC and hexamethyldisiloxane as the working fluid that demonstrated superior performance, with an exergy utilization factor of 98.07 % and an energy efficiency of 63.6 %. Further, the SRC-based CCHP system demonstrated a shorter SPP of 4.73 years compared to the ORC-powered system, which had an SPP of 5.074 years. In a different study, Pradeep Varma and Srinivas (2015)  analyzed a cogeneration system using WHR from a cement plant handling 7100 tons daily, revealing the potential for generating 12.5 MW of power. Ishaq et al. (2018a)  developed a cogeneration system utilizing waste heat from a steel furnace, achieving energy and exergy efficiencies of 38.2 % and 39.8 %, respectively. Haghanimanesh et al. (2022)  designed a trigeneration system powered by steel-slag heat recovery. Utilizing three subsystems of the Biogas Cycle (BGC), the system generated 700 kW of electricity, 40 tons of cooling capacity through an ARC, and produced 29,400 kg/h of hot water via heat dissipation in RC and ORC condensers. The system performance was thoroughly analyzed, and the associated costs of power exergy, cooling, and heating were 30.14, 28.73 and 29.25 $/h, respectively. Ishaq et al. (2018b)  harnessed waste heat from a glass melting furnace to ensure stable and sustainable electricity, hydrogen and freshwater production. The system incorporated an RC, a hydrogen-production Cu Cl cycle, and reverse osmosis desalination, resulting in fresh water production at a rate of 17.4 g/s and hydrogen at a rate of 12 g/s. The overall system demonstrated energy and exergy efficiencies of 37.9 % and 47.7 %, respectively. The concept of industrial WHR was also investigated by Liu et al. (2021)  who addressed low-grade waste recovery through a cogeneration system combining an ORC with a heat pump cycle. The proposed system achieved 6.4 % higher thermal efficiency and 1.2 % more WHR efficiency compared to traditional systems. The WHR efficiency peaked at 9.9 % at an evaporation temperature of 61.85 °C, and the system's exergy performance was highly influenced by evaporation temperature. Increasing the evaporation temperature reduced total exergy loss, resulting in a 27 % increase in energy efficiency. In summary, polygeneration technology has witnessed significant research and utilization of WHR systems, effectively harnessing waste heat from various sources such as ICEs, GTs, FC, and industrial processes, leading to improved energy efficiency and sustainability. The foregoing literature review highlights the growing interest and adoption of WHR systems for polygeneration, acknowledging their potential to provide additional energy and hence improve overall efficiency. Numerous methods have been explored to optimize polygeneration performance through WHR techniques. However, a closer examination of the literature reveals a notable research gap. While most published works have focused on enhancing polygeneration performance, there is limited emphasis on evaluating their economic and environmental performances. Addressing this gap is crucial to evaluate the practical viability of WHR-based polygeneration systems. Evaluating their environmental feasibility through life-cycle assessments and carbon footprint analysis will reveal potential emissions reductions and sustainability. Simultaneously, conducting thorough economic assessments of these technologies by employing cost analyses and financial metrics will identify the most cost-effective solutions, fostering their widespread adoption.   4 Results and discussion This section aims to shed light on the 4E potential of WHR-based polygeneration systems and to explore the various indicators and methodologies used for their assessment. By collecting data from existing literature and conducting a comprehensive analysis of these systems, valuable insights have been gained, providing a deeper understanding of their performance. Table 2   provides a comprehensive summary of noteworthy findings from these studies, capturing key parameters and outcomes related to WHR-based polygeneration. This table serves as a consolidated reference that provides researchers with essential information for further exploration and advancement in the field of WHR-based polygeneration. 4.1 Energy and exergy analysis Through a careful examination of Table 2  and the extensive literature review, it is evident that assessing polygeneration systems is more complicated compared to traditional separated generation approaches. This complexity arises from the diverse design and performance objectives that are involved. Consequently, rigorous thermodynamic analysis is essential for evaluating the viability and potential improvements. Energy parameters play a significant importance within this context, with energy and exergy efficiencies being the primary indicators of system performance. Moreover, crucial metrics such as the COP, EUF, and PESR were employed to evaluate polygeneration systems, providing reliable benchmarks for designs and configurations comparison and optimization. The reviewed studies presented in Table 2  provided an analysis of energy and exergy efficiencies. These findings were further scrutinized in Table 3  , revealing insightful results. Polygeneration systems exhibit a wide range of energy efficiencies, spanning from 20.8 % to 96.9 %, and exergy efficiencies ranging from 24.1 % to 63.6 %. These results provide compelling evidence of the significant variation in the efficiency achieved by these different polygeneration systems. Furthermore, upon observing the databases compiled from the reviewed articles, it becomes apparent that energy and exergy values are not evenly distributed. To gain further insight into their distribution among polygeneration technologies, the data was divided into four equal parts or quartiles, each accounting for 25 % of the systems. This division allowed for a better understanding of the proportion of the systems falling within different efficiency ranges, as presented in Table 4  . The observation revealed that a substantial portion of the systems fell within quartiles 2 and 3, signifying a spectrum of moderate to high efficiency. Quartile 4 encompasses the top performing systems, showing exemplary efficiency levels. Conversely, quartile 1 denotes the systems with the least efficiency in terms of both energy and exergy efficiency. This analysis provided a comprehensive perspective on the diverse performance levels exhibited by polygeneration systems across distinct efficiency metrics. Additionally, it is important to highlight the remarkable achievement of the trigeneration system developed by Xu et al. (2021) , which demonstrated the highest energy efficiency of 96.9 % in the database, utilizing waste heat and liquefied natural gas (LGN) cold energy to generate power, heating, and cooling. Despite its impressive energy efficiency, it exhibited the lowest exergy efficiency of 24.1 % in dataset. This disparity indicates that, while the system efficiency converts the energy input into useful output energy, the quality of the energy inputs, represented by waste heat and LGN cold energy, is relatively low. As a result, the system was unable to fully harness the available work potential from the input energy, likely due to the lower thermodynamic quality of the waste heat. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering both energy and exergy efficiencies when evaluating WHR-based polygeneration systems. Therefore, improving the exergy efficiency of such systems would require enhancing the capture and utilization of the thermodynamic quality of waste heat, thereby maximizing the overall energy utilization and system performance. Assessing WHR-based polygeneration systems involves analyzing data collected from various reviewed articles, including COP and EUF. Table 3  presents the COP and EUF values for each evaluated system, providing valuable insights into their energy utilization capabilities. The analyzed data revealed a notable effectiveness in these systems, with COP and EUF values ranging from 0.57 to 0.81 and from 53.27 % to 98 %, respectively. This demonstrated their ability to convert a significant portion of waste heat into useful outputs, highlighting the potential for energy savings and the importance of promoting energy efficiency and sustainable energy utilization. Furthermore, the wide range of EUF values observed across the evaluated systems revealed variation in their capabilities and performance levels. For instance, Nami and Anvari-Moghaddam (2020)  achieved the highest COP and EUF values by harnessing waste heat from cement plants to drive their CCHP system. Conversely, the CCHP system analyzed by Wang et al. (2020)  powered by gas turbine WHR, exhibited a lower level of efficiency in terms of COP and EUF when compared to other examined systems. Comparing these two systems offered insights into several possible factors influencing the attainment of high or low values. First, the efficient recovery of waste heat could play a significant role in achieving high values of COP and EUF. In Ref. (Nami and Anvari-Moghaddam, 2020 ), an HRSG captured waste heat and converted it into steam, which has a higher heat capacity and carries more energy compared to the traditional heat exchanger used in Ref. (Wang et al., 2020 ). Another contributing factor is cascading energy, using waste heat from one process as an input for another to maximize energy utilization and increasing the COP. In Ref. (Nami and Anvari-Moghaddam, 2020 ), waste heat powered the ORC, and excess heat from the steam condenser was harnessed to provide heating. Additionally, waste gas exiting the HRSG was used for space cooling through a single-effect LiBr-H2 O absorption chiller and DHW production via a heat exchanger. In the case of Ref. (Wang et al., 2020 ), the waste heat discharged from the gas turbine cycle drove both the CO2  cycle and ORC for power generation. Subsequently, the residual heat from the ORC evaporator was used to drive the ARC. Moreover, optimizing various components and processes within the polygeneration system is crucial for achieving a high COP. Wang et al. (Su et al., 2018 ) performed a single-objective optimization using PSO algorithm on their trigeneration system, resulting in an increase in COP from 0.57 to 0.61. Furthermore, these results highlighted a strong relationship between a high COP and high EUF in a WHR-based polygeneration system. A high COP signifies an efficient conversion into useful energy outputs, resulting in higher energy utilization. In summary, evaluating the performance of WHR-based polygeneration systems involves considering specific system characteristics, designs, and factors influencing the overall performance. One key factor is the efficiency of WHR technologies, which directly influences the system's ability to effectively recover and use waste heat. Another important aspect is cascading energy utilization, maximizing energy utilization within the system. Additionally, optimizing the system components enhances overall efficiency, enabling WHR-based polygeneration systems to achieve enhanced performance, increased sustainability, and improved energy utilization.  4.2 Economic analysis In this study, numerous research papers have been scrutinized to determine their potential financial advantages. As illustrated in Table 2 , a commonly used method to assess the cost-effectiveness of WHR-based polygeneration systems is exergoeconomic analysis. It involves an evaluation of each component within the polygeneration system from both thermodynamic and economic standpoint. To enhance the assessment of the reviewed studies, an economic analysis, using specific indicators outlined in Section 2.2  was conducted. Data from the reviewed articles, including equipment costs, project lifespan, interest, discount rates, operating and maintenance costs, annual operating hours, and energy outputs, were gathered. The findings and outcomes from the literature and the economic evaluation carried out by the authors of this work are illustrated in Table 5  . The analysis of NPV results for WHR-based polygeneration systems, revealed a wide range of NPV values, indicating the potential for a substantial net cash flow surplus and significant revenue generation, making them attractive and lucrative. It was observed that achieving a high NPV is primarily influenced by the lower capital costs. A noteworthy example supporting this finding is the research conducted by Liu et al. (2022) . Through an examination of the gathered and calculated data, this system demonstrated a notably lower initial capital investment among the evaluated articles, resulting in an NPV of M$6.08. Furthermore, achieving energy cost savings is another critical factor contributing to a high NPV, as emphasized in the same reference. This study incorporated a polygeneration system, harnessing excess heat during the thermal throttling process of an OFC. This system enabled the simultaneous production of power, cooling, and hydrogen, leading to increased energy outputs, reduced losses, and subsequently, decreased energy costs. Consequently, additional cash inflows were generated, ultimately boosting the NPV. These findings underscored the significance of capital costs, energy cost savings, and additional revenue streams in determining the NPV of WHR-based polygeneration systems, emphasizing the need to consider these factors during system design and evaluation for optimal financial performance. Moreover, the examination of WHR-based polygeneration systems' IRR, as outlined in Table 5 , illuminated their financial profitability and attractiveness. IRR values exhibited variance, ranging from 14.97 % to 60.51 %, indicating diverse financial outcomes across the reviewed studies. Systems with an IRR closer to 60.51 % demonstrate higher potential for profitability, generating substantial revenue, and deliver attractive returns on investment. Conversely, systems with lower IRR, around 14.97 %, offer comparatively lower rates of return. Although they remain financially viable, their returns on investment are lower, suggesting a longer payback period or less favorable financial outcomes. Notably, higher IRR values are associated with lower initial investment. When the initial investment is relatively small compared to the potential profits of the polygeneration system, the IRR increases. Additionally, a shorter payback period enables quicker recovery of the initial investment. This relationship between the payback period and IRR was evident in the case of the trigeneration system discussed in Ref. (Haghanimanesh et al., 2022 ), which relied on steel slag heat recovery, demonstrated the lowest economic feasibility with an IRR of 14. 97 % and a high SPP of 5.69 years. These results can be justified by the slow net annual profit rates throughout the system's lifetime, which were unable to effectively recover the initial capital investments due to the high investment costs associated with the project. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that polygeneration systems can exhibit different rankings in terms of NPV and IRR, as illustrated in Table 5 . For example, in Ref. (Dehghani and Kyoo Yoo, 2020 ), the system achieved a higher NPV value, but a lower IRR compared to Ref. (Zoghi et al., 2019 ). These variations could be attributed to differences in their cash flow patterns and the system's lifespan. NPV considers the timing of cash flows, whereas IRR focuses on the overall rate of return. The system in Ref. (Dehghani and Kyoo Yoo, 2020 ) could have higher cash inflows in the earlier years of the project and lower cash inflows in the later years, which may result in a higher NPV. On the other hand, the system in Ref. (Zoghi et al., 2019 ) could have exhibited a more balanced or front-loaded cash flow pattern, which could lead to a higher IRR. The timing and magnitude of cash inflows and outflows significantly influence the rankings of NPV and IRR. Additionally, differences in discount rates also hold significant importance in determining the rankings of the NPV and IRR. The former is sensitive to the discount rate used to calculate cash flow. As exemplified in Ref. (Zoghi et al., 2019 ), when a relatively low discount rate of 4 % is applied, it led to a higher NPV. However, this lower discount rate also results in a lower IRR compared to the system in Ref. (Dehghani and Kyoo Yoo, 2020 ) using a discount rate of 10 %. Therefore, the choice of discount rate can influence the rankings of NPV and IRR, with lower discount rates favoring higher NPV, but potentially lower IRR. It is essential to carefully consider the appropriate discount rate to accurately assess the financial attractiveness and profitability of waste heat based-polygeneration systems. The levelized costs of electricity, cooling, and heating were extensively evaluated in the reviewed studies, revealing a spectrum of LCOE values ranging from 0.0003 to 0.87 $/kWh. Lower LCOE values imply higher cost-effectiveness competitive economics, while higher LCOE values suggest potentially lower efficiency or increased operational expenses. A comparative analysis is required to identify the specific factors contributing to the observed cost ranges and determine the underlying reasons for the variations in the LCOE. For instance, considering the system described in Ref. (Nami and Anvari-Moghaddam, 2020 ), which achieved the highest LCOE value, and compared it with the system that achieved the lowest value. Upon examining the gathered and calculated data, it was apparent that the system in Ref. (Nami and Anvari-Moghaddam, 2020 ) incurred higher operational and maintenance costs due to its complex component interactions. In contrast, the gas turbine waste heat recovery CCHP system in Ref. (Wang et al., 2021b ) exhibited a more sophisticated and interconnected arrangement, efficiently maximizing energy recovery through well-integrated subsystems. The components interacted in a cascading manner with the gas turbine exhaust gas preheating the air, which then entered the combustion chamber for fuel combustion. The exhaust gas from the turbine was further utilized to preheat the air. The sCO2  cycle integrated with an ARC (sCO2 -ARC) system efficiently utilized waste flue gas to generate power and produce cooling capacity. On the other hand, the system described in Ref. (Nami and Anvari-Moghaddam, 2020 ) has a simpler configuration in which waste heat is primarily used in the HRSG to drive the Rankine cycle (RC). The warm waste gas from the HRSG was utilized for cooling through an absorption chiller and for warming pressurized water for domestic hot water purposes. The interactions between the components in this system are more straightforward and limited to specific applications, compared to the comprehensive integration observed in Ref. (Wang et al., 2021b ). An additional reason that further supports the lower overall cost of electricity generation achieved in Ref. (Dehghani and Kyoo Yoo, 2020 ) showed the presence of abundant high-temperature waste heat, reaching 758 °C, in exhaust gases from a gas turbine. This high-temperature waste heat was efficiently harnessed to generate energy outputs, resulting in improved cost-effectiveness. In contrast, Ref. (Nami and Anvari-Moghaddam, 2020 ) considered a low-temperature waste heat source of 249.85 °C. Harnessing this waste heat effectively required the implementation of additional technologies, such as HRSGT, to facilitate the operation of the RC. Although utilizing the waste heat from a lower-temperature source is beneficial, it introduced complexities and additional costs to the polygeneration system. The incorporation of an HRSGT and the associated RC not only increased the capital investment required, but also influenced the operating costs of the polygeneration system. These technologies require regular maintenance and result in energy losses that can adversely affect the overall efficiency and economic viability of the system. Therefore, the utilization of high-temperature waste heat from the exhaust gases in Ref. (Wang et al., 2021b ) offered a distinct advantage in terms of cost reduction, as it eliminated the need for additional technologies and mitigated the impact on both capital and operating costs. By leveraging abundant high-temperature waste heat, the polygeneration system described in Ref. (Wang et al., 2021b ) achieved a significantly more efficient and cost-effective energy generation process. Moreover, the reviewed studies encompassed a range of LCOC values, spanning from 0.0024 to 1.13 $/kWh. Lower LCOC values indicated more economically favorable cooling solutions, reflecting enhanced efficiency in cooling generation and potentially reduced operational costs. Among the various factors influencing LCOC, WHR stands out as a key contributor to achieving lower values. A comparison of the results obtained in Ref. (Dehghani and Kyoo Yoo, 2020 ) and Ref. (Zoghi et al., 2019 ) revealed that higher LCOC values are associated with lower energy efficiency. However, it is essential to emphasize the importance of achieving high WHR efficiency. This aspect is particularly evident in scenarios where energy inputs are of low quality, such as excess heat generated during biofuel production from textile wastewater, as mentioned in Ref. (Dehghani and Kyoo Yoo, 2020 ) which typically operates at 60 °C. In contrast, waste heat derived from a diesel engine, as noted in Ref. (Zoghi et al., 2019 ), is available at a higher temperature of 300 °C. Higher WHR efficiency implies greater utilization of waste heat for cooling generation, resulting in improved energy efficiency and potentially lower LCOC. To accomplish this, several fundamental principles are considered, including efficient heat exchangers, optimal heat transfer processes, and effective thermal management. These principles have been successfully demonstrated in the trigeneration system presented in Ref. (Zoghi et al., 2019 ), which combined an ORC with an ACCPS for WHR from a diesel engine. ACCPS introduced a compressor between the evaporator and absorber to enhance the system performance, while a screw expander was employed to increase power generation. The ORC system was utilized to prepare domestic hot water through the DHWHX. Furthermore, the LCOH values varied significantly, ranging from 0.0001 to 0.5 $/kWh. Notably, the scale or capacity of the system has emerged as a critical determinant in achieving lower levelized cost values. To exemplify this, we delve into the trigeneration system discussed in Ref. (Haghanimanesh et al., 2022 ). This system was purposefully designed to harness heat from arc furnace slag in a steelmaking facility. The operation entailed transferring the high-temperature slag to a heat recovery system, with air passing through the slag blocks to attain elevated temperatures. Four heat exchangers captured the heat potential, and a biogas-powered heat exchanger reformer played a vital role in facilitating chemical reactions and maintaining precise temperature control. The high-temperature air was directed to an RC heat exchanger for power and hot water. The air stream then proceeded to an ORC heat exchanger using a specific operating fluid for power generation. The last heat exchanger, designed for the ARC, fulfilled the cooling requirements of the system. In comparison with the other systems reviewed, this trigeneration system incurred notably higher LCOE and LCOC, amounting to 0.22 and 1.13 $/kWh, respectively. These values were associated with capacities of 703 and 140 kW, respectively. Despite the exorbitant LCOE and LCOC figures, this system achieved a relatively low LCOH value of 0.08 $/kWh due to its remarkable heat production, reaching an impressive 20.85 MW. This observation suggests that a substantial increase in energy output holds a significant sway over the overall cost of a product.  4.3 Environmental analysis To evaluate the environmental impact of WHR-based polygeneration systems, researchers have employed various assessment methodologies, including GHG emission analysis, offering insights into the system's contributions to climate change and improvement opportunities. Another important indicator utilized is CO2 ERR, measuring the effectiveness of CO2  emissions mitigation efforts. In this section, a benchmarking study is conducted to compare WHR-based polygeneration systems with conventional separated system. This benchmark serves as a valuable tool for assessing the environmental potential of these systems. The reference system, depicted in Fig. 2  , represents the baseline scenario. It involves the production of heating energy through a natural gas boiler, purchased electricity from the grid, and delivery of cooling energy through an electric chiller powered by grid electricity. In this study, various WHR-based polygeneration systems were reviewed, focusing on their impact on greenhouse gas emissions compared to the baseline scenario. The analysis covered four countries: China, Iran, Turkey, and South Korea. Each country contributes differently to the overall energy production mix, resulting in varying quantities of GHG emissions throughout the electricity generation process. Consequently, the analysis considered the emission factor values of fossil fuels to accurately assess their environmental impact. The reviewed articles provided valuable data on GHG emission factors and annual energy production, which were meticulously collected and analyzed, as summarized in Tables 6 and 7   , respectively, forming the fundamental basis for understanding and evaluating the environmental impact associated with a range of polygeneration systems. In Table 8  , the calculated results highlight the significant reduction in GHG emissions achieved by implementing these systems, ranging from 0.37 to 400.88 kt of carbon dioxide. These results demonstrated the critical role of WHR-based polygeneration systems in carbon mitigation. These systems play a pivotal role in substituting high‑carbon fuels with waste heat, thereby contributing substantially to climate preservation. Furthermore, it is worth emphasizing that the upper end of the range, which represents a yearly reduction of 400.88 kt of CO2 , signifies a remarkable achievement. The remarkable success of the polygeneration system discussed in Ref. (Wang et al., 2021b ) is undeniable proof of its exceptional ability to reduce GHG emissions. Its outstanding energy generation capacity surpasses that of all the other systems under review, resulting in a higher output of electricity and thermal energy. By effectively displacing the reliance on conventional fossil-fuel-based sources, this system demonstrates its potential as a sustainable and effective solution for combating climate change. Carbon pricing is widely recognized as one of the most effective tools available to encourage emitters to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. By establishing a price per ton of emissions through either a carbon tax or an emissions trading system (ETS), carbon pricing creates financial incentives for businesses and industries to adopt cleaner and more sustainable practices. One of the key benefits of carbon pricing is its crucial role in achieving the goal of net-zero emissions at a reasonable cost. Imposing a price on carbon encourages the reallocation of activities from high‑carbon to low-carbon alternatives. This shift incentivizes industries to invest in cleaner technologies and practices, ultimately leading to a reduction in overall emissions. Moreover, carbon pricing generates revenue that can be used to finance the development and implementation of clean technological innovations. This funding can be directed towards research and development initiatives for harnessing renewable energy sources, energy efficiency measures, and other sustainable solutions. By investing in these areas, carbon pricing facilitates the transition towards a greener and more sustainable economy. The usefulness of carbon pricing is evident from recent data. According to a report by the organization for economic co-operation and development (OECD), carbon prices accounted for over 40 % of global GHG emissions in 2021 across the 71 countries studied, representing an increase of 32 % in 2018. This indicates its growing efficiency in reducing emissions and fostering sustainable practices (OCDE, 2022 ). Additionally, carbon pricing plays a central role in assessing the environmental impacts of polygeneration systems, which is crucial for determining their viability and sustainability. Numerous countries worldwide, including the European Union, Canada, China, South Korea, and several states in the United States, have adopted carbon-pricing initiatives. This section focuses on studies selected from diverse regions worldwide, each with distinct carbon tax levels, as presented in Table 7 . Countries such as China and South Korea have relatively low carbon taxes (LCTs), with rates below $30 per ton of CO2 . On the other hand, certain countries, such as Iran and Turkey, have not yet implemented explicit carbon pricing policies, resulting in zero carbon taxes (ZCTs) within those regions (https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/map_data ; Elaouzy and El Fadar, 2023c ). The calculated environmental cost savings of the reviewed polygeneration systems, as summarized in Table 8 , serve as a testament to their remarkable environmental efficiency. These systems, incorporating WHR as a key component, have resulted in reduced expenses and minimized negative environmental impacts, offering a sustainable approach to energy production. The data presented in Table 8  suggest that there is a relationship between the amount of saved GHG emissions and the ECS in waste heat-based polygeneration systems. Specifically, higher levels of GHG emission reductions were associated with higher ECS values. This observation can be attributed to the impact of the carbon pricing mechanisms. By successfully reducing GHG emissions, the carbon footprint can be effectively lowered, subsequently decreasing carbon pricing costs. This reduction in costs contributes to a higher ECS, which is crucial for businesses aiming to comply with regulations on emissions reduction and environmental sustainability. Overall, WHR-based polygeneration is an exceptionally promising technology that contributes to increasing energy security by using energy more efficiently than traditional plants, thereby resulting in lower energy consumption and higher energy output. The simultaneous production of multiple energy outputs reduces the overall production cost, increases profitability, and contributes significantly to carbon mitigation by improving the energy production efficiency and providing cleaner energy alternatives.   5 Conclusions and recommendations This study offered a comprehensive analysis of WHR-based polygeneration systems, focusing on their effectiveness from a 4E perspective.
