                  Circular economy (CE) is widely recognized in the built environment as a crucial strategy for improving construction industry sustainability. This strategy can meet multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and offer effective solutions to environmental issues. Prefabricated modular building systems have proven to be a circularly viable method. This opens up endless possibilities for circular building systems. However, the selection of materials and preparation of sustainability strategies are still incomplete, hindering CE concepts' translation into practice. Moreover, few studies on the sustainability of modular building components and materials have been conducted, with most focusing only on individual aspects without addressing a comprehensive approach. This study proposes a topological interlocking system for designing reusable modular components that maximize sustainability. A two-stage evaluation method (AHP-TOPSIS) is used to construct an evaluation index based on the design and material of a building component. By incorporating CE strategies for reuse with a topological interlocking system, this study explores the potential of reusable modular components in sustainable construction and lays the groundwork for a circular economy business model (CEBM).

Handling Editor: Cecilia Maria Villas Bôas de Almeida Circular economy (CE) is widely recognized in the built environment as a crucial strategy for improving construction industry sustainability. This strategy can meet multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and offer effective solutions to environmental issues. Prefabricated modular building systems have proven to be a circularly viable method. This opens up endless possibilities for circular building systems. However, the selection of materials and preparation of sustainability strategies are still incomplete, hindering CE concepts' translation into practice. Moreover, few studies on the sustainability of modular building components and materials have been conducted, with most focusing only on individual aspects without addressing a comprehensive approach. This study proposes a topological interlocking system for designing reusable modular components that maximize sustainability. A two-stage evaluation method (AHP-TOPSIS) is used to construct an evaluation index based on the design and material of a building component. By incorporating CE strategies for reuse with a topological interlocking system, this study explores the potential of reusable modular components in sustainable construction and lays the groundwork for a circular economy business model (CEBM).

According to Herczeg et al. (2014) , the building industry consumes approximately 30%–50% of the total natural resources, generating 40%–50% of all waste (Clark et al., 2006 ). Thus, it is imperative to reduce GHG emissions immediately by implementing waste hierarchy systems (Rasmussen et al., 2018 ) to increase material efficiency due to global waste management (Gálvez-Martos et al., 2018 ; Soni et al., 2022 ; Brewer and Mooney, 2008 ) and a lack of resources (Chen et al., 2010 ). The design of new buildings should be improved to minimize waste (Maheshwari et al., 2022 ) throughout their lifespan, including deconstruction and demolition (Akinade et al., 2017 ; Tingley and Davison, 2011 ; Akinade et al., 2019 ). However, most existing buildings are not designed using these considerations, causing significant waste generated during renovations and demolitions (Esa et al., 2016 ; Ghisellini et al., 2018 ; Soni et al., 2022 ). According to the waste hierarchy (Rakhshan et al., 2020 ), recycling consumes significant amounts of energy and resources, making reuse more efficient. Reusing building materials also has a lower environmental impact than recycling (Geyer et al., 2002 ; Purnell and Dunster, 2010 ). Moreover, recycling contributes to significant environmental pollution through GHG (Addis, 2012 ; Rasmussen et al., 2018 ). Although reuse has a greater positive impact than recycling, it has declined in recent decades (Addis, 2012 ; Rakhshan et al., 2020 ). The topic of reusing building components and materials has been the research subject for several years (Kirchherr et al., 2017 ). However, those studies have focused only on individual aspects rather than taking a comprehensive view of the issue. As outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), developing reusable systems and models will transform a linear economy into a circular economy (CE) (Eberhardt et al., 2020 ; Kirchherr and van Santen, 2019 ). A topological interlocking component, also referred to as a modular or prefabricated component, is a method of promoting reuse in architecture and construction (Dyskin et al., 2012 ). As this component can be easily assembled and disassembled, it can be reused in various construction projects, reducing waste and construction costs (Eckerth et al., 1998 ; Buhé et al., 1997 ; Dyskin et al., 2005 , 2012 ). In addition to improving material efficiency and resource conservation, building construction can be more efficient with a lower environmental impact (Marsh et al., 2022 ; Cabeza et al., 2013 ; O’Grady et al., 2021 ; Dyskin et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, sustainable and affordable construction methods can contribute to achieving the SDGs, particularly SDG 9 regarding infrastructure and industrialization, SDG 11 regarding sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 12 regarding responsible consumption and production (United Nations, 2015 ; Awan and Sroufe, 2022 ). The SDGs have emerged as an effective strategy for promoting environmental sustainability (Eberhardt et al., 2020 ; Rakhshan et al., 2020 ; Schoggl et al., 2020 ). Incorporating modular components and SDGs into CE can enhance the development of a circular economy business model (CEBM), providing many benefits to society and the environment (Behrend, 2020 ; Salvador et al., 2021 ). To address the increasing demand for building construction while minimizing environmental impact, this paper investigates the design of reusable modular components, the selection of materials, and the implementation of CEBM. Identifying the key criterion to prioritize when designing modular components for reuse is essential. According to Fig. 1  , this research employs a methodology that integrates modular design, material evaluation, and CEBM to promote sustainable building practices. The first section of the paper introduces the background and approach used in this study. Section 2  describes reusable modular components that employ topological interlocking systems and material reuse. This section explains how modular components are designed to promote design for reuse, allowing building components to be interchangeable more easily, reducing material waste, and improving the durability of buildings. Section 3  discusses a two-stage evaluation method (AHP-TOPSIS) for determining the most important criteria for designing reusable building components and how these components can be optimized for sustainability. Using this method, a circularity evaluation index based on CE principles can also be constructed to rank materials (UHPC, concrete, metal). Section 4  addresses the implementation of the ‘rent to buy’ strategy as the groundwork for a CEBM. By applying this strategy, it is possible to reduce waste, promote sustainability, and reuse modular building components. Lastly, Section 5  concludes with a summary of the findings and recommendations for future research. The final remarks of this section emphasize the importance on integrating modular design, material selection, and CEBM to achieve sustainable building practices.  2 Reusable building components Reusing components is the most widely used and practiced CE strategy for reducing building environmental footprints (Esa et al., 2016 ) and GHG emissions (Rakhshan et al., 2020 ; Kirchherr et al., 2017 ). A design and construction that promotes reusing, particularly assembly and disassembly (Eberhardt et al., 2020 ), can minimize resource consumption (Gorgolewski, 2008 ), waste generation (Charytonowicz and Skowroński, 2015 ; Soni et al., 2022 ), and construction costs (Brewer and Mooney, 2008 ; Addis, 2012 ; Sansom and Avery, 2014 ). In product manufacturing, reuse refers to products and materials (Addis, 2012 ; Eberhardt et al., 2019 ; Demir, 2009 ; Marsh et al., 2022 ). Choosing materials with a long-life cycle can increase the product reuse rate (will be discussed in Section 3 ), making the product easy to disassemble and reassemble (Eckerth et al., 1998 ). Hence, strategies incorporating reuse into design and/or reusable materials can enhance CE in a more productive and valuable manner than recycling (Charytonowicz and Skowroński, 2015 ). Despite increased costs associated with dismantling, storing, and transporting reused building components, they provide flexibility in secondary applications (Bocken et al., 2016 ; Kara et al., 2022 ; Rashid et al., 2013 ). A case study of the disassembly of a building showed that reusing concrete elements could reduce embodied GHG emissions by 36% (Rasmussen et al., 2018 ; Pons-Valladares et al., 2023 ). Using a topologically interlocking modular component design, this study proposes reusable and easily dismantled components to achieve sustainability. It is thus imperative to consider both component design and material selection during the design phase of a building. Reuse involves reusing still-functional components for a similar purpose, and preparation for reuse may include inspection, cleaning, and repair (Defra, 2011 ; Cabeza et al., 2013 ). As defined by Fivet and Brutting (2020) , reusable components possess three characteristics: reversibility, modularity, and transformability. The concept of reuse, or design-for-disassembly refers to the removal of structural components for reuse in other structures (Marsh et al., 2022 ; O’Grady et al., 2021 ). Reusing structurally sound elements in new construction can eliminate the need to produce new materials, reducing the number of resources consumed. However, the geometry of the structure and the compatibility of new functions must also be considered while accommodating multidimensional reusable components (Gorgolewski, 2008 ). Following are explanations of geometries, systems, and materials that embody the concept of reusable building components. 2.1 Topological interlocking system Topological interlocking system offers many benefits from a construction and geometric perspective (Dyskin et al., 2005 ; Weizmann et al., 2021 ). The elements are geometrically connected and self-aligned, so minimal assembly errors reduce construction time and costs. In terms of structural characteristics, the form is relatively simple and easily disassembled, which allows for the replacement of elements without deconstructing the entire structure. With their ability to interlock within structures, topological interlocking blocks provide flexible structures with a high tolerance for local displacements (Bejarano and Hoffmann, 2019 ). Despite the inaccurate placement of the block, their high resistance to crack propagation and tolerance for localized failure, along with their ease of adjustment between elements, can result in the block self-positioning into the correct position even when the original placement is incorrect (Dyskin et al., 2012 ). The interlocked structure resistant to lateral forces will likely have a low displacement due to gravity or external constraints on the Z axis. Partly sliding on the contact surface can present technical difficulties during manufacturing and assembly. The necessary lateral constraints can be provided by placing a frame around a planar array of interlocking blocks (Dyskin et al., 2005 , 2012 ). By applying controlled lateral loads through the frame, it is possible to adjust the bending stiffness of the structure. Stress concentrations can also be induced by providing restraint through cables that pass through topologically interlocking block assemblies (Zareiyan and Khoshnevis, 2017 ). Therefore, modules are an important component of the whole structure. They can be easily broken down into several pieces during assembly. Lego bricks are an excellent example of this modularity. We can take a bunch of blocks and build different structures from them. As a result of this advantage, the design can be more efficient and reusable (Buhé et al., 1997 ; Dyskin et al., 2012 ). The combination modules or components may be used for outdoor structures, such as public art, outdoor furniture, etc.; auxiliary structures, such as shading structures for exterior building walls; and skeleton structures for indoor compartments and display racks. Assembling these components does not require mortar or any other bonding material or mechanism, which might prevent them from being reused in the future (Dyskin et al., 2003 ; Buhé et al., 1997 ). A case study of a green wall system comprising topologically interlocked identical blocks is developed, enabling it to function as a decorative and shaded wall system. A vertical greening system is proposed to reduce carbon emissions and improve competitive advantage. A peripheral frame restraint system is the main structural component. In most cases, the perimeter frame requires special treatment to prevent lateral movement and provide structural support at the boundaries. A similar, perhaps more general type of restraint could also be used in further research to reinforce the structure by utilizing internally pre-tensioned cables. However, the basic component can still be reused. The rest of the structure does not require connectors or adhesives. Two rectangles of the same area but with different directions are used as the basic component and stacked vertically to interpenetrate one another, as shown in Fig. 2  a. When the upper and lower elements are stacked, they will provide a mutual binding force. External tensioning cables can further strengthen the simplest constraint. Fig. 2 b illustrates the possible constraints while the surrounding structure acts as the frame. Some types of components can be combined (Fig. 3  ) to create new models and rules, facilitating the development of more diverse architectural models. Various potted plant units or planting bags may be replaced according to the needs of the architects or designers (Fig. 4  ). Therefore, by incorporating the concept of modular planting wall component into the business model, the building facade may be designed circularly. The modular design makes the product easier to repair, prefabricate, and upgrade. Only a few parts need to be removed, which greatly reduces the cost and workload associated with replacing damaged components. Furthermore, it is also conducive to meeting users' evolving and long-term needs, making the product less outdated and ensuring its longevity. Integrating architectural design into reusable and renewable resources (Qureshi et al., 2022 ) enables products and raw materials to be used continuously (Cabeza et al., 2013 ). As long as the units are consistent, the connections remain the same, regardless of the inconsistent designs of different designers. The fabricated components may be reused in other construction projects and combined with other designs. Using topologically interlocking modular components, the authors tested a new architectural paradigm contributing to sustainable design.  2.2 Material reuse In recent years, material reuse has been recognized by policymakers, companies, and academics as a method of reducing embedded emissions and promoting sustainable development (Hopkinson et al., 2019 ; Moncaster et al., 2019 ; Cabeza et al., 2013 ). The industrial sector has largely applied CE principles (recycle, remanufacture, refurbish, repair, reuse) to metals and concrete (Miller et al., 2016 ; Dunant et al., 2017 ). The differences between these materials may influence the interpretation of CE strategies (Yang et al., 2020 ). Ashby (2013)  has stated that concrete components are often demolished not because of physical decay but for technical, functional, economic, and desirable reasons. In this respect, components that are still in good condition can be remanufactured and reused. Metals can be regarded as high-value, low volume, low embodied carbon materials. Concrete, on the other hand, is regarded as a material with low value, high volume, and low embodied carbon (Ashby, 2013 ; Miller et al., 2016 ). Thus, the construction industry developed ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) in order to meet the demand for high-strength concrete (Haber et al., 2018 ; Meng et al., 2016 ). A number of commercial UHPCs contain a high cement content and fine aggregates with extremely small diameters (Habert et al., 2013 ), which significantly impact the environment and embodied carbon levels (Spragg et al., 2022 ; Gartner, 2003 ; Scrivener et al., 2018 ). Due to its mechanical properties, (Ghafari et al., 2015 ; Haber et al., 2018 ), concrete structures can last longer than conventional structures (Miller et al., 2016 ). A comparison of three commonly used construction materials: ordinary concrete, UHPC, and metal, is presented in Table 1  . Considering the different life cycles and CE strategies, the selection of materials becomes increasingly important. According to the case study in Section 2.1 , all structural elements of demountable frame systems are assumed to be reusable after demolition. As far as cementitious composite materials are concerned, they have advantages such as high durability and strength (Bajaber and Hakeem, 2021 ), recyclability, meeting market demands, and being environmentally friendly (Stengel and Schießt, 2014 ). Another hypothesis is that all modular components are fully restored after dismantling. Concrete or UHPC would be a convenient material for making blocks when cast in molds. The other material is metal, since it is a flexible and multifunctional material that can be used repeatedly. Demolition of metal and concrete is a commonly used waste management practice (Marsh et al., 2022 ; Den Hollander et al., 2017 ; Soni et al., 2022 ). Metal can be recycled into another metal with the same or greater quality (Dunant et al., 2017 ), while crushed concrete can be used as a filler material (down-cycled) for some construction applications or as an aggregate for fresh concrete. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a material evaluation to determine which material is most compatible with the reuse principle. The following section employs a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to define the key aspects of designing reusable modular components and selecting the appropriate material for promoting SDGs.   3 Multi criteria decision making method MCDM methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are flexible and efficient (Opricovic and Tzeng, 2004 ; Marzouk and Sabbah, 2021 ). These methods help establish priorities and make the best decision when quantitative and qualitative factors are to be considered (do Nascimento and Santos, 2022 ; Gulum et al., 2021 ). To determine the final rank, AHP will first obtain the criteria weights, followed by TOPSIS to evaluate alternatives and sort the index weights (Gulum et al., 2021 ). A diagram illustrating this process can be found in Fig. 5  . First, the criteria need to be determined based on the literature reviews. However, these criteria may be modified to meet the objectives. The second step is to formulate the criteria matrix. Once criteria have been defined, a pairwise comparison must be carried out (Mehra et al., 2023 ; Costa et al., 2023 ). In the third step, equation (1)  is employed to compute the weights of each criterion. In the fourth step, weights are normalized (Costa et al., 2023 ; Gulum et al., 2021 ) based on the criteria identified in the first step. An appropriate scale must be designed and applied to this evaluation. In the fifth step, positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS) are calculated (Costa et al., 2023 ) based on equations (2)–(4) , along with the criteria weights that were determined in step 3. As a final step, equation (5)  is applied to rank the order according to its relative proximity (R.C.I.*). This ranking is then used as the basis for determining the final ranking. 3.1 AHP In the AHP method, issues are structured in hierarchies, and components of those hierarchies are evaluated using pairwise comparisons (Saaty, 1990 ; Costa et al., 2023 ). This decision-making method can improve the validity of judgments in the real world by calculating weights for main criteria and sub-criteria, ranging from the lowest to the highest levels (Dağdeviren et al., 2009 ). Combining AHP and TOPSIS effectively solves MCDM in various fields (Gulum et al., 2021 ; Opricovic and Tzeng, 2004 ; Marzouk and Sabbah, 2021 ; Costa et al., 2023 ). Following is the formula to calculate the criteria weights. First, convert the resulting matrix units to the same units for comparison. The normalized weighted value v i j      is calculated as v i j   = w i  r  i j      , j = 1 , … , J ;  i = 1 , … , n   ,  where w i     is the weight of the attribute or criterion,(1) ∑ i  = 1 n   w i  = 1       3.2 TOPSIS TOPSIS is used to evaluate the superiority of ranking schemes by comparing distances between the best and worst products (Opricovic and Tzeng, 2004 ). The best alternative is the closest to the PIS and the furthest away from the NIS (Costa et al., 2023 ). Experts are interviewed to define the criteria and TOPSIS is applied after the weights of the criteria have been determined. In this method, each criterion is assumed to increase or decrease monotonically over time (Costa et al., 2023 ; Gulum et al., 2021 ), and then each criterion is divided into profitability index (I⩍') and the loss index (I⩍''). Therefore, if the benefit criterion is being studied, the larger the performance value, the larger the preference value, which is most beneficial to the evaluation result (Marzouk and Sabbah, 2021 ). It means when evaluating profitability criteria, a higher profitability performance value results in a more favorable evaluation outcome. Conversely, when evaluating cost criteria, a lower loss performance value is more beneficial to the evaluation result (Lai et al., 1994 ; Opricovic and Tzeng, 2004 ). According to Fig. 5 , the importance weights of the criteria are normalized. Then, PIS and NIS are identified using these equations:(2) A *  = { v 1  *  , … , v n  *   }  = { ( max j  v i j   | i ∈ I ′   )  , ( min j  v i j   | i ∈ I ″   )   }      (3) A −  = { v 1  −  , … , v n  −   }  = { ( max j  v i j   | i ∈ I ′   )  , ( min j  v i j   | i ∈ I ″   )   }       Assuming that I ′     represents a set of positive attributes, the larger it is, the better it performs, while I ″     represents a set of negative cost attributes. The smaller the cost attributes, the better it is. Calculate the separation measurement by using Ohrid's formula (Opricovic and Tzeng, 2004 ). Find the distances between the ideal and negative ideal solutions:(4) D j *  = ∑ i  = 1 n    ( v i j   − v i *   )  2  , j = 1 , … , J .  D j −  = ∑ i  = 1 n    ( v i j   − v i −   )  2  , j = 1 , … , J      Use relative proximity indicators (R.C.I.) to find the ideal solution in determining each planned locations strengths and weaknesses. The formula is as follows:(5) R . C . I  *  = D j −  − ( D j −  + D j *   )  , j = 1 , … , J      Eventually, preference rank order is based on relative proximity (R.C.I.*).  3.3 Component design evaluation Evaluation of modular components is conducted using a set of criteria derived from the design process. This section provides an overview for identifying critical scenarios for design reuse based on product evaluation, in this case, an evaluation of modular components (Section 2.1 ). To achieve the SDGs of reuse, the early stages of the design process must focus on identifying and prioritizing key design factors. According to Sections 3.1 and 3 .2, it is necessary to identify the value aspects of modular components before ranking the chosen criteria. Literature on building, CE, and sustainable development was reviewed to evaluate and analyze the interlocking system, emphasizing the impact on building materials and construction industries. The final set of indicators was developed (Table 2  ) to determine the most relevant implications of how topologically interlocked components contribute to value creation. Criteria need to be evaluated to interpret and implement topological interlocking systems into reusable modular components. Based on defined criteria, pairwise comparisons of process characteristics were conducted. The resulting comparison matrix was filled according to the literature reviews (Costa et al., 2023 ; Mehra et al., 2023 ; do Nascimento and Santos, 2022 ), topological interlocking design, and the criterion weight was determined (Table 3  ). The calculation process involves obtaining the original matrix through a pairwise comparison of the matrix and the priority vector (Costa et al., 2023 ). It is then possible to establish a hierarchical structure using the basic division magnitude of the AHP evaluation scale (Saaty, 1990 ; do Nascimento and Santos, 2022 ). As a first step, the row vector sum is computed. In the second step, the number in the matrix is divided by the row sum, and the eigenvector is obtained using the geometric mean. In the third step, each column's average is calculated, representing the level weight of each factor at that level. The importance of various dimensions and factors has been highlighted by comparing criteria for evaluating modular component designs. As presented in Table 3 , joint design is the most important design indicator (0.453), followed by material selection (0.246) and size determination (0.150), respectively. This emphasizes that the design of components is a crucial aspect of product reuse, and careful consideration of materials is vital for effective engineering and CE practices. This modular component design aims to contribute to the effectiveness and practical application of the CE by exploring how products can be reused multiple times. In construction, however, reuse is part of the design for deconstruction (Tingley and Davison, 2011 ; Akinade et al., 2017 ). Reusing modular components represents a significant departure from conventional business models to CEBM (Bocken et al., 2016 ), since CEBM seeks to promote sustainable production and consumption patterns as well as prolong the lifespan of products and materials.  3.4 Material evaluation According to the modular component evaluation result in Section 3.3 , material plays an important role in achieving reuse. High-strength materials, such as concrete, UHPC, and metal (Section 2.2 ), can be utilized to enhance the durability, reusability, and safety of the product. This section will evaluate materials from various perspectives, including economic, environmental, energy, recycling, policy, and social dimensions. First, various criteria were identified by reviewing the relevant literature (Sadrolodabaee et al., 2022 ; Hartwell et al., 2021 ). Based on the evaluation criteria presented in Table 4  , the AHP framework is formulated, the main criteria and sub-criteria are constructed in a hierarchical structure. A non-dimensional magnitude value can be calculated when the measurement units are different. By aggregating the dimensionless values derived from the weighing system (Pons and de la Fuente, 2013 ; Hosseini et al., 2016 ), ranking and assessing each criterion's significance is possible. A global sustainability index is calculated based on each criterion's dimensionless values. The next step will focus on the circular metrics of the 18 evaluation sub-criteria. A hierarchical diagram and relative weights for each assessment parameter must be defined before the proposed evaluation model can be used to assess material sustainability (Gilani et al., 2017 ). This research divides the hierarchical diagram into two levels: main criteria and sub-criteria. For a reliable assessment scenario, the hierarchical diagram must include a minimum number of representative and independent criteria (Gilani et al., 2017 ; de la Fuente and Fernández-Ordóez, 2018 ). The sustainability criteria in this section are divided into five main indicators. As presented in Table 4 , the criteria under Economic (C) focus on the cost and management of the product's life cycle and reducing its environmental impact and market value. Energy (EN) criteria assess the energy consumption and renewable resources used during production, deconstruction, and recycling. The Environment (E) criteria focus on sustainable design for recyclability, safe management, and GHG emissions reduction. The Recycle (R) criteria evaluate the recyclability of materials, product reuse, track maintenance, recycling technology, and information exchange system. The Policy (P) criteria address environmental certifications and regulations to support reuse and circular practices. Lastly, the Society (S) criteria emphasize customer service, enterprise willingness, and interdisciplinary research to enhance user collaboration and positively impact long-term sustainability. Weights will be assigned to all parameters within the hierarchical diagram once they have been defined. Different types of recycling strategies exist based on the different material recycling methods. Recycling and reuse are two such strategies. Recycling involves breaking down materials into raw materials and using them to create the same product they originated from (R1). On the other hand, reuse involves maintaining the integrity of an item (R2). While reuse is more environmentally friendly than recycling, recycling still plays a crucial role when items are damaged, worn out, or unsuitable. The lifespan of each material must be considered when it comes to the recycling and reuse of materials. An analysis of recyclability, remanufacturing, and durability is required for each material's lifecycle (E1). As such, E1, R1, and R2 are separate items that must be calculated individually. Due to the CE being a complex field, spanning various levels such as economics, energy, environment, recycling, policy, and society, the 18 indicators have been simplified and compared individually for consideration. A pairwise comparison matrix was used to determine the environmental benefit properties of CE. This comparison of criteria and targets for assessing CE materials displays how different levels of dimensions, factors, and indicators were weighted. In this study, the assessments are analyzed using the concordance ratio. According to the screening criteria, a score of 0.01 indicates compliance and internal consistency with the criteria. There are several weightings listed in Table 5    for the first (main criteria) and second layers (sub-criteria), respectively. Recycle (0.386) is the most significant indicator of a CE, followed by Environment (0.0333) and Economic (0.0132). It is important to note that environmental benefits primarily drive GHG emissions (0.159) and that carbon emissions in the production and use process are significantly higher than other factors. This also indicates that calculating the carbon footprint is essential to CE development. Another factor is Product Reuse (0.150). If products can be reused at the lowest cost, they will have a greater impact on the environment, which will be the focus of our research. Furthermore, Table 5  also illustrates that the top three sub-criteria for evaluating environmental benefits are GHG (E3), Product Reuse (R2), and Track Maintenance (R3). When designing modular components for reuse, special consideration must be given to both the system's design form and the durability of the materials used. During reuse, material characteristics can impact unit transportation, storage, and maintenance management. Performance safety is measured by predicting the deterioration of the material's compressive strength. Furthermore, the unit recycling management capacity of different materials is estimated based on their compressive strength in the same cycle. The grading system for evaluating the materials (Table 7  ) is based on three different scores: 0 for not visible, 1 for not significant, and 2 for significant. These estimates are based on comprehensive evaluations from literature sources. For instance, the recovery rate of materials (R1), specifically metals are considered more significant. However, there is currently no available literature on the recycling feasibility of UHPC materials. This study evaluated three common building materials (Table 1 ): ordinary concrete, UHPC, and metal. Table 6  presents a quantitative description of the CE evaluation criteria divided into 18 sub-criteria. Some boundary conditions are applied for estimating the indicator values. For instance, when designing modular components for reuse, special consideration must be given to both the system's design form and the durability of the materials used. During reuse, material characteristics can impact unit transportation, storage, and maintenance management. Performance Safety (E2) is measured by predicting the deterioration of the material's compressive strength. Furthermore, the unit recycling management capacity of different materials is estimated based on their compressive strength in the same cycle. Table 7  presents the evaluation results based on the CE criteria in Table 6 . The second row in parentheses is a numerically normalized weighting matrix. The weights assigned to each criterion are normalized to be comparable to rank and rate criteria. The PIS and NIS are shown in Table 8  . Finally, according to TOPSIS calculations, Table 9   ranks the three materials' environmental benefits. The maximum value of R.C.I.* is 0.8105. This value belongs to UHPC, which can be recycled and reused to develop CE as a strategy. However, a low score does not necessarily indicate poor quality or a lack of sustainability. For instance, metals may be more suitable for recycling than reuse. According to this assessment, UHPC significantly contributes to the long-term sustainable development, which confirms the findings of other studies (Dong, 2018 ; Habert et al., 2013 ). Several factors indicate that UHPC can be considered a priority material for the CE, and CE strategies will emphasize design reuse rather than recycling materials (Purnell and Dunster, 2010 ). It is possible to greatly enhance the environmental benefits of CE by reusing UHPC products, tracking repairs, and exchanging technology (Bajaber and Hakeem, 2021 ; Boesch and Hellweg, 2010 ; Stengel and Schießt, 2014 ). The durability of UHPC allows it to extend service life, improve the long-term environmental impact, and reduce the equivalent annual costs when used during service (Boesch and Hellweg, 2010 ). Building developers and investors indicated that reusable materials could facilitate innovation and knowledge creation, allowing organizations to adapt more effectively to legislative or social changes (Kasarda et al., 2007 ). It is possible to substantially reduce embodied carbon in construction using prefabricated UHPC elements that can be disassembled and reused (Bajaber and Hakeem, 2021 ; Eberhardt et al., 2019 ). Developing products that improve the environment and reduce future costs would give the company a competitive advantage and contribute to its strategic vision, such as the SDGs (Nußholz et al., 2019 ; Kirchherr et al., 2017 ).  3.5 Advantage of topological interlocking system and UHPC materials Topologically interlocked modular components have been identified as a promising strategy to increase circularity in construction. The components are designed to fit together seamlessly and be easily disassembled, facilitating reuse. Strong and durable materials are essential for implementing these strategies. This is based on the evaluation of the modular components (Section 3.3 ) and materials (Section 3.4 ), indicating that material is the most critical aspect of the CE strategy. As presented in Table 3 , Joint (J) and Material (M) play a crucial role during the early stages of design, highlighting the importance of design and materials in achieving reuse. Table 7  shows significantly higher satisfaction levels for three sub-criteria: Sustainability (E1), Reuse (R2), and Maintenance (R3), emphasizing the material superiority index. Furthermore, in Table 9 , UHPC was ranked first for material reuse, contributing significantly to long-term sustainable development, while metal was ranked second for material recycling. Hence, it can be concluded that reusable building components can be implemented by integrating long-lasting and high-strength materials, such as UHPC, as well as modular and reversible designs with topological interlocking systems. However, other factors should also be considered when reusing building components, such as transportation distances, site conditions, the number of materials used, and the quality of the components. Another advantage of this type of building component is its flexibility. Because the components are modular, they can be used in various applications and configurations to adapt to different environments and needs. Having this level of flexibility may also make the product more appealing to customers, who will be more likely to rent or buy a product that can be customized to meet their needs. Hence, reusable modular components are an excellent product for CEBMs that use rent-to-buy strategies, which will be discussed in the next section.   4 Circular economy business model The circular economy business model (CEBM) is important as companies move towards circular practices. By repeatedly maintaining, repairing, reusing, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling, CEBM can extend product and building life cycles (Leontief, 1991 ; Jaillon and Poon, 2014 ; Stahel, 2019 ; Bocken et al., 2014 ). In contrast to linear business models, products often degrade after a single use phase and lose their inherent value (Pieroni et al., 2020 ; Massa et al., 2017 ), CEBM proposes a new way to create and extend value while committing to CE principles (Bocken et al., 2016 ). The CE may not be the only objective, but rather part of a process that aims to improve sustainability and efficiency through long-term design (Benachio et al., 2020 ; Esa et al., 2016 ; Nußholz and Iiiee, 2020 ). There are two strategies that can be used to extend the value of a product: design for reuse, which promotes standardization of geometry, and design for recycling, which promotes optimization of geometry (Ness and Xing, 2017 ; Nußholz and Iiiee, 2020 ; Kasarda et al., 2007 ). However, as explained in the previous sections, reusing is more efficient than recycling (Charytonowicz and Skowroński, 2015 ) because it consumes less energy and resources (Geyer et al., 2002 ; Purnell and Dunster, 2010 ). Two-stage evaluation method used in this study is an example of design for reuse evaluation. The tools and information stakeholders need to evaluate various possibilities for promoting circularity are part of each construction stage. Architects, contractors, developers, material suppliers, waste management companies, government, and end users are all stakeholders in the architecture and building industry. Hence, ensuring the necessary flow of information between stakeholders is crucial (Geldermans, 2016 ; Freudenreich et al., 2019 ) to maintain the resilience of CE strategies throughout the building lifecycles (Stahel, 2019 ; Velte et al., 2017 ). As illustrated in Fig. 6  , linear economies in the architecture and building industry involve design and construction, operation and maintenance, followed by demolition. Thus, it produces a large volume of waste (Soni et al., 2022 ) and depletes resources (Miatto et al., 2017 ). However, this can be reduced by designing reusable modular components and introducing stakeholders to the CE concept (Benachio et al., 2020 ; Kirchherr et al., 2017 ). Reusable modular components with topological interlocking systems have great potential as CEBM products since they offer flexibility and durability. The greatest opportunity for this type of component lies in its potential to be easily disassembled and reused (Eckerth et al., 1998 ; Buhé et al., 1997 ; Dyskin et al., 2012 ). The components can be easily removed and replaced, making them easy to repair and update over time. This eliminates the need to manufacture new components, which can save resources and reduce waste. Moreover, using a topological interlocking system can also improve the durability and safety of the product. In addition to minimizing the risk of failure or collapse, the components are securely connected without additional materials, such as glue or screws, increasing the product's lifespan and improving customer satisfaction. Reducing waste, improving material efficiency, and promoting more sustainable production and consumption patterns, contribute to achieving the SDGs. Managing building components is then required, which involves the reuse and recycling of building materials (González et al., 2021 ). This includes disassembling designs and identifying reusable materials in good condition (Bocken et al., 2016 ). Further, CEBM can be implemented by establishing materials banks, allowing shared resources and components to be rented rather than purchased, thus improving the value of building products (Arranz and Arroyabe, 2023 ). Creating shared value between service customers and providers is important to implement the “rent to buy” strategy successfully (Massa and Tucci, 2013 ; Heyes et al., 2018 ). This strategy can be used to encourage adopting more sustainable consumption practices (Arranz and Arroyabe, 2023 ). The idea is that customers can rent a product for a set period of time and then choose to buy it outright or return it to the company for refurbishment or recycling. From a circular economy perspective, this approach can have several benefits. First, it encourages the reuse of products and extends their lifespan, reducing the need for new products to be manufactured (Salvador et al., 2021 ). Second, it can help to reduce waste and improve resource efficiency by ensuring that products are kept in use for as long as possible (Behrend, 2020 ; Salvador et al., 2021 ). Third, it can provide an affordable way for consumers to access high-quality products without committing to a full purchase upfront (Knox and Eliashberg, 2009 ; Behrend, 2020 ). However, it's important to note that the success of rent-to-buy strategies in CEBM depends on several factors. For instance, the product must be durable and designed for reuse or refurbishment. Additionally, the rental price must be affordable and competitive compared to buying a similar product outright (Salvador et al., 2021 ). Finally, the company must have a reliable refurbishment and recycling system to ensure that products are used, and their materials are recovered and reused at end-of-life. Overall, the rent-to-buy strategy has the potential to be an effective way to encourage sustainable consumption practices in a CEBM (Behrend, 2020 ; Salvador et al., 2021 ). Still, careful consideration must be given to the specific product, pricing, and end-of-life management strategies to ensure success. Clear regulation and a solid procurement contract are necessary to facilitate this building's life cycle design process. Ultimately, CEBM requires collaborative efforts between stakeholders to manage and control the system more efficiently and sustainably.  5 Conclusion and future research recommendation The research explores the potential of reusable modular components in the construction industry. A two-stage evaluation method (AHP-TOPSIS) to evaluate the circularity of building materials and determine the critical scenario for designing reusable building components that positively impact CE strategy is proposed in this research. Some criteria and weight sets from the assessment metrics can be adjusted according to stakeholder preferences and scenarios. This approach can be applied to any modular component design. Research results lead to the following conclusions.• Joint design (0.453/1.000) and material (0.246/1.000) are the key criteria for designing reusable modular components to promote CE strategies. Effective joint design and material selection ensure modular components can be easily disassembled and reused. This not only minimizes waste but also reduces the costs associated with the production of new components. Therefore, architects and designers should prioritize the design of joints and select appropriate materials to promote circularity in building construction, which can contribute significantly to achieving the SDGs.  • Product reuse (0.150/1.000) is considered a significant indicator of CE. By designing the joint using topological interlocking systems and UHPC (0.810/1.000) as the component's material, the reusability and durability of the building components can be increased, thereby extending the life cycle of the building. The interlocking system provides additional stability to the building, minimizing the risk of failure or collapse. Additionally, UHPC offers a high level of strength and resilience, reducing the need for frequent replacements and repairs. These factors result in considerable cost savings, increased customer satisfaction, and a more sustainable approach to building construction.  • Topologically interlocked modular components are designed for reuse and can be integrated into the “rent to buy” business strategy to enhance CEBM. This new business model is more affordable for customers and can increase the utilization rate of products, which can ultimately reduce the number of new products required. CEBM can contribute to sustainable consumption patterns by creating materials banks and collaborating with stakeholders. Integrating building construction practices with these strategies can promote sustainable development and support SDGs. However, the effectiveness of these strategies must be assessed in various scenarios and business environments.    Future research could focus on validating the findings of the study and developing upfront CE plans using this strategy. Businesses and policymakers can participate in this research to create new business models. A large database of environmental benefit assessment systems is needed to investigate the implications of greater access to recycling designs, business models, and innovation assessment systems for the CE. This database can assist in identifying areas of improvement and opportunities for innovation in the construction industry and other sectors. Furthermore, future research can explore the potential of enhancing circularity in the construction industry by utilizing advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain. Through these technologies, circular processes can be monitored, tracked, and verified more accurately and efficiently, and new circular business models can also be developed. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into how CE principles are implemented in the construction industry, and future research can utilize these findings to advance CE maturity.
