                  Energy projects in pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 7, which addresses affordable and clean energy, can have numerous synergies and trade-offs with all other SDGs and their targets. However, the identification of such interlinkages is both complicated and scattered in literature. To overcome this gap, this research presents the development and application of the Sustainable Development Goals Impact Assessment Framework for Energy Projects (SDGs-IAE) for qualitative assessment of SDG target synergies and trade-offs within the context of a given energy project. Two diverse case studies ‒ the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the Hinkley Point C Nuclear Power Station (HPC) ‒ are utilized to test the framework. Each case study highlights important SDG target interactions drawn out by this process. The GERD analysis shows the many synergies that result from energy access expansion while also bringing up trade-offs related to transboundary water rights and community relocation. In the case of the HPC, long-term ecosystem impacts of uranium mining and trade-offs related to future climate resilience and energy affordability are identified. The final resulting framework and corresponding excel-based tool can inform a dialog among stakeholders about the key areas of improvement related to the project´s social, environmental and economic sustainability.

Keywords Sustainable Development Goals Impact Assessment Framework for Energy Projects (SDGs-IAE)  Synergies and trade-offs  Energy projects  Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)  Hinkley Point C Nuclear Power Station (HPC)    1 Introduction The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a global call to action for sustainable development, covering areas from poverty eradication and the provision of basic services to combating climate change and reducing inequalities [1] . By definition, the 17 goals (SDGs) and their targets are “integrated and indivisible” and thus, action to implement the 2030 Agenda must consider their interlinked nature. SDG7 aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.” Links between this goal and the other SDG targets have been examined by the scientific community in an attempt to better understand these interactions and support policy makers in realizing these goals. Fuso Nerini et al. [2]  have conducted an analysis from an energy perspective; the mapping resulted in the identification of 143 and 65 targets that have synergies and trade-offs, respectively, with SDG7 and decisions about energy systems. McCollum et al. [3]  use the seven-point scale proposed by Nilsson et al. [4]  to assess interactions between SDG7 and the SDGs, from indivisible (+3) to cancelling (−3). The study also notes the importance of context, including governance, geography, and technology, upon these interactions. Thacker et al. developed an assessment of how infrastructure projects, including energy projects, influence the achievement of the SDGs [5] . Santika et al. [6]  also conducted an assessment of the interlinkages among energy and the SDGs, and attempted to estimate energy demands related to the achievement of the SDGs. In all cases, the research emphasizes the importance of the inclusion of energy aspects in the 2030 Agenda, as well as the continuation of interdisciplinary research in this area. Action for the provision of energy to a growing global population and for the achievement of SDG7 will require investment in and development of new energy projects of all types and on many scales [7] . A balance must be struck between meeting energy needs while also considering both present- and long-term impacts across the other SDGs. With only ten years remaining until 2030, assessments of global action for the SDGs show that progress towards their achievement is slow, and in some cases, backwards. Much more ambitious transformation is necessary to achieve any of the goals on a global scale [8] . One of the barriers to achieving these goals is a failure to understand the linkages between different aspects of sustainable development; as such, work mapping these interactions and communicating them to decision-makers is necessary [9] . Improved knowledge and communication of the impacts of energy projects could strengthen democratic practice and ensure desirable outcomes [10] . Considering the demonstrated abundance of interactions between energy and the SDGs, tools that facilitate accessing knowledge of how specific energy projects may affect the local and global achievement of the SDGs are sorely needed. These tools will inform a necessary dialog among stakeholders on the key actions to improve social, environmental and economic outcomes of energy projects. At present, there are several frameworks and analytical tools that can be utilized to assess the sustainability of a project from an economic, social, or environmental perspective, or some combination of these “pillars of sustainability” [11] . These processes are quantitative and/or qualitative and can be widely applied to policies, programs, and projects across industries and development areas. While there are many variations of tools to assess sustainability, a sample of commonly used assessments, as well as newer assessments that incorporate the SDGs, are included in Table 1  . However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no method that can be used to assess energy projects that considers all aspects of sustainability presented by the 2030 Agenda. As shown in Table 1 , sustainability assessments are either incomplete and do not evaluate projects across all aspects of sustainable development (EIA, LCA, S-LCA, SIA), or they do not provide information that would be useful while considering a specific project (SDG Impact Assessment Tool, Mapping the interactions between the Sustainable Development Goals). This is a critical research gap. At the same time, assessing how projects affect all SDGs is becoming a requirement in several areas. An increasing number of research funders require applicants to specify how project proposals link to specific SDGs. This approach is being pioneered by the likes of The Swedish Research Council Formas and the UK Global Challenges Research Fund [18 ,19 ]. Funding and development assistance agencies are following similar routes, such as the Swedish Development Agency [20] . Moreover, local and national governments are increasingly mapping their projects and policies to the SDGs [21–24] . As the far-reaching impacts of projects on sustainable development become increasingly recognized, it is expected that calls for impact assessments that consider all of the SDGs will increase. It is evident that the benefits of a tool to quickly assess these impacts are multiple, from supporting and guiding mapping exercises to fulfilling project requirements. With the aim to overcome the research gaps presented above with a focus on energy projects, this perspective presents a Sustainable Development Goals Impact Assessment Framework for Energy Projects (SDGs-IAE), and tests it using two diverse case studies – the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and the Hinkley Point C Nuclear Power Station. The aim of the SDGs-IAE Framework is to provide an initial framework to guide diverse project stakeholders in assessing and discussing possible synergies and trade-offs between their projects and the targets of the 2030 Agenda. The high-impact case studies were chosen to test the Framework using two diverse scenarios for energy development. This perspective first presents an introduction with targeted literature research and gaps that this study fills. Next, the methods used to develop the SDGs-IAE Framework are presented and the SDGs-IAE Framework itself is described, with its application to two case studies. Finally, conclusions, limitations, and proposed future work are discussed.  2 Methods The SDGs-IAE Framework and corresponding excel-based tool was developed with the steps detailed in the following paragraphs and depicted graphically in Fig. 1  . To develop the framework, an initial review of the existing scientific literature on mapping energy systems and targets to the SDGs was undertaken to identify and consolidate general interlinkages between energy-related projects and the SDGs. This enriches the analysis done by Fuso Nerini et al. [2] , investigating (a) if an interaction between an SDG target and any type of energy project exists, (b) if this interaction consists of synergies, trade-offs, or both, and (c) how this interaction can be influenced by the context of the energy project. This step was critical to developing an understanding of the complex relationships between energy and the SDGs. Only published studies in academic and peer-reviewed journals and ‘gray literature’ (e.g., reports published by governments and international organizations) were utilized to define the interlinkages within the Framework. While this decision may have some limitations as certain interlinkages might have been overlooked if not documented in literature, and as certain stakeholder groups (academics, governmental officials and international organizations) are better represented, it was deemed necessary to guarantee the quality of the Framework. Nevertheless, for nearly all interlinkages several items of published evidence were found and included to attempt to better represent evidence from diverse fields. Only the outcome targets (1.1, 1.2, etc.) have been included in this mapping. Means of Implementation (MoI) targets (1.a, 1.b., etc.) were excluded; while energy projects could be affected by these targets, it is less likely that energy projects would either help or hinder their achievement. Synergies and trade-offs related to the Paris Agreement (PA) within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in areas concerning carbon emissions and low-carbon energy systems are also included to encompass the effects of energy on climate change mitigation. SDG13 acknowledges the primary role of the UNFCCC in the global response to climate change, justifying the limited inclusion of the PA within the SDGs-IAE Framework [1] . Then the authors iteratively developed a series of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions to help users determine the nature of an interaction between an energy project and the SDG targets. This was based on existing literature that establishes interlinkages. Where possible, questions were nested to minimize the number of questions that users must answer. Iterations were made to ensure the nested questions within the assessment do not omit any potential interlinkage between an SDG target and an energy project. Authors’ meetings were held periodically to develop and review the results until a consensus was reached. Following adapted methods used to develp successful questionnaires, the “closed ended” questions were designed to be realistic, relevant to the context of an energy project, and unambiguous. Following two pre-screening questions regarding the location of the project and the energy type, the questions were grouped into three areas to facilitate the answering process: (1) questions regarding the project governance, (2) questions related to the specific characteristics of the project, and (3) questions about the project outcomes. A decision-tree example of one question and its follow-ups is shown in Fig. 2  . A full, final list of the questions, the resulting synergies and trade-offs, and the rationale to support each relationship can be found in Annex 2 of the supplementary information. Finally, the developed SDGs-IAE Framework and corresponding excel-based tool was tested using the two case studies presented in this paper. The interlinkages between those projects and all outcome SDG targets were assessed in parallel steps: (1) an assessment of interactions with each target using the methods developed and refined in Fuso Nerini et al. [2 ,25 ,26 ] and Vinuesa et al. 2020 [27] , totaling 126 single evaluations, and (2) an assessment using the SDGs-IAE Framework. The framework was then iteratively refined so no interlinkage found during 1) was missed. The SDGs-IAE Framework presented in this perspective is designed to be improved upon in future work and by other actors as it is applied to a wider variety of energy projects. The SDGs-IAE Framework is available as Annex 1, as well as in an online forum where other practitioners can provide inputs, share applications, and submit advice for improvements. This resource will be critical for collecting user feedback and making comprehensive updates as more projects are assessed using the framework. All questions in the framework, together with the full decision tree, rationale for interlinkages, and references are reported in Annex 2. The resulting framework and its applications are described in the following sections.  3 The SDGs-IAE framework The final SDGs-IAE Framework is a questionnaire-accessed database of interlinkages between energy projects and the SDG's targets, consisting of a maximum of 94 questions for energy project developers and decision-makers to answer for a given project. There is a potential for synergy with 94 targets and trade-off with 58 targets. However, because of the nested nature of many of the questions, most projects will not require all 94 questions to be answered and a smaller number of possible synergies and trade-offs will be identified in each context. By filling in the questionnaire with project-related information, users can find a longlist of possible ways a project can positively or negatively affect the local and global attainment of all SDGs. Based on academic and gray literature, the Framework is designed to be evidence-based and apolitical. It has a user-friendly interface and an accessible questionnaire for broad usability. Finally, it is intended to be used by all stakeholders in a project. This supports energy democracy processes [10 ,28 ,29 ] by allowing affected stakeholders to access the information and results, thus enabling the benefits of participatory approaches [30–34] . The list of possible synergies and trade-offs generated by the completion of the questionnaire is a valuable tool for project stakeholders because it quickly highlights the wider sustainable development impacts of a given energy project in a way that is easy to digest for those unfamiliar with the SDGs. Further, the tool highlights the multi-sectoral impacts of energy projects and can work to break down siloed thinking. Users connected to an energy project in any phase can access the tool in the form of an user-friendly macro-enabled Excel workbook, found in Annex 1. Furthermore, users are able to upload comments, applications and modifications to the SDGs-IAE Framework online. The evaluation asks questions regarding various project details, including location, economic planning, and end-uses for the energy. The series of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions are generally straightforward to answer; users also have the option to answer ‘maybe’ or ‘yes and no’, which returns all possible synergies and trade-offs for either case, as well as any resulting follow-up questions. Questions using terminology or concepts that users may not be familiar with are accompanied by a short explanation and link to further information in the form of published academic literature or UN publications. In-depth explanations of general reasons for synergies and trade-offs are also provided to initiate a process of further exploration in each target area. The results also produce a visual categorization of the SDGs into three groups, according to the three pillars of sustainable development, namely Society, Economy  and Environment  [35 ,36 ]. This is a pragmatic division; however it is worth pointing out that as the framework investigates interlinkages using all of the SDG outcome targets, it encompasses many cross-cutting themes, such as the institutional aspects embedded in all the SDGs and particularly in SDG16 on Peace and Justice and SDG17 on Partnerships for the Goals. While the framework is evidence based, there can be some degree of subjectivity; users may infer an unintended meaning of a question or estimate while answering, and this may return results that do not depict a full, accurate picture of a project's SDG target interlinkages [37] . Also, a single user (or a stakeholder group) could give more importance to one specific interlinkage between the project and a target over another. Therefore, while the framework is useful for single users attempting an initial sustainability analysis of an energy project, its ideal use is in a workshop setting with representatives from different stakeholder groups (e.g. project developers, community representatives, policy makers and funders). Design of such workshops could be informed by participatory processes such as the UNECE methodology for understating dynamics across Nexus systems through participatory ‘dialogues’ involving key stakeholders [38 ,39 ], and other workshop-based efforts designed to support the participation of different stakeholders in decision processes (such as in previous work by Whitton et al. [40]  presenting a social sustainability framework for energy infrastructure decisions, and work by Fuldauer et al. [41]  and by Adshead et al. [42]  on participatory planning for the local SDGs achievement in Small Island Development states). In such setting, the framework could be filled iteratively in multi-disciplinary breakout groups to start an informed dialog on how a project could affect the delivery of selected SDGs. Such groups could then discuss which interlinkages to prioritize (e.g. the trade-offs with SDGs targets that need targeted actions), and how to address those. To enable such discussion, after the results are compiled, users have the option to evaluate and organize their results within the context of the project. The “User-Defined Priority” capability uses a scale from 0 (not applicable) to 5 (top priority) to weight the relevance of proposed synergies and trade-offs and prioritize areas of focus for further impact analysis. This function enables users to focus on the interlinkages of greatest interest within the given context and to erase interlinkages that may not be relevant to the project at all; these will arise as a result of the authors’ intent to make this tool widely applicable. Using the organization capability, stakeholders will be able to shortlist which synergies and trade-offs warrant further analysis and project-related action, allowing for post-processing of the framework results. The evaluation of two case studies using this SDGs-IAE Framework aided in the identification of gaps and redundancies and helped to further refine the tool. The authors conducted a review of published literature and reports from local governments, news outlets, and project developers for both the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and the Hinkley Point C Power Station. Using this information, the authors attempted to complete the SDGs-IAE Framework questionnaire from the point of view of project planners, community members, and other decision-makers. The information used to rationalize the answer to each question is summarized in Annexes 3 and 4. The linkages generated by the SDGs-IAE Framework for each case study are included in Annexes 3 and 4. The framework returns synergies and trade-offs with a generic description of the potential SDG-energy project interaction, found in Annex 2. It is expected that with this information, project developers can evaluate how the results apply to their project context. This exercise has been done for both case studies in the following sections to demonstrate the utility of the SDGs-IAE Framework. The evaluation of each case study is intended to test the functionality of the newly developed framework, and therefore the analyses that follow serve only as an overview of the resulting synergies and trade-offs. More detailed analyses can be found in Annexes 3 and 4.  4 SDGs-IAE Framework application 1: the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), located on the Blue Nile River near the Ethiopian-Sudanese border, is a hydropower project with a reported 6,000MW capacity, 15,700GWH of expected annual production and a reservoir volume of up to approximately 74 billion m3 . Construction commenced in 2011 and the power plant is expected to be fully operational in 2020 [43] . The project is part of the Ethiopian government's plan to become a low carbon, ‘green’ economy and will expand electricity access to an underserved rural population while aiding domestic industrialization and urbanization [44] , and making Ethiopia part of an ‘African Clean Energy Corridor’ [45] . The project has been financed mainly by domestic bonds, with external support from a Chinese firm for the supporting high voltage transmission line and from the World Bank  for electricity export infrastructure. The GERD has also sparked controversy, namely over local land rights and socioeconomic impacts [46] , as well as wider water rights in the Blue Nile River Basin, due to the limited knowledge of how the dam and reservoir will impact downstream water availability in Sudan and Egypt [47–49] . When analyzing the GERD project using the SDGs-IAE Framework, we found 77 and 43 possible target synergies and trade-offs, respectively, for the GERD, as well as a synergy and a trade-off with the Paris Agreement, shown in Fig. 3  . The most synergies rely on the expansion of electricity access in Ethiopia and the surrounding region for both urban and rural populations [47] . Generally, this should aid in progress toward a high number of targets, including poverty targets 1.1 and 1.2 [50] , hunger targets 2.1–2.4, education targets 4.1–4.7 [51] , and equality target 10.2 [52] . Hydropower is also a renewable, carbon-neutral form of electricity generation; this enables a large number of synergies, including those related to target 3.9, which aims to minimize deaths related to air pollution, 12.4 and 12.5, related to the reduction of waste generation [53]  and 13.2, which calls for the integration of climate change measures into national planning [54] . These synergies, among others, demonstrate the many potential positive social and economic impacts of GERD in Ethiopia [55] . Important trade-offs are found with targets 6.5, which calls for transboundary resource cooperation [56] , and 16.7, which is related to inclusive decision making [57] , among others. These arise mainly from conflicts related to the transboundary Blue Nile River and the unpredictable effect that the project on water availability in downstream countries. Social conflicts related to the local communities’ lack of a voice in the decision-making process and their displacement must also be seriously considered. Displacement and resettlement of communities is considered one of the most pressing social justice problems associated with large hydropower projects [58] , and has trade-offs with target 11.4, preservation of cultural heritage, 10.7, safe and responsible migration [59] , and 16.7, among others. Ecosystem disruption is also a notable impact, captured by trade-offs with 15.1–15.5 [47] . All trade-offs, on both a national and regional scale, represent serious concerns surrounding the project's overall sustainability that should be further analyzed and addressed to avoid further conflict and damage as construction and reservoir filling continue. Full results for how the GERD project may impact local and international SDG attainment can be found in Annex 3.  5 SDGs-IAE Framework application 2: Hinkley Point C Power Station The Hinkley Point C Power Station (HPC) is a nuclear power station currently under construction in Somerset, southwest England. HPC will consist of two EPR reactors for a total capacity of 3,200MW. The plant is expected to provide energy to power approximately five million homes [60] , and this capacity could assist the UK in realizing its plans to close all coal power plants by 2025 [61] . HPC is a joint venture between the British government and Electricité de France (EDF), though funding also comes from the China General Nuclear Power Company. Presently, HPC is expected to be completed in 2025 and will cost an estimated 27 billion USD [62] . The project has been criticized by the media and political figures due to high construction costs and electricity prices for consumers [63] , construction delays [64] , Brexit, and the heavy financial support from both the British government and Chinese companies [65–67] . The SDGs-IAE Framework identifies possible synergies with 39 targets and the Paris Agreement and possible trade-offs with 31 targets for the HPC project (Fig. 4  ). Many of the synergies are a result of the energy generation technology. Nuclear power is carbon neutral and non-air-polluting, leading to synergies with select health (3.1, 3.2, 3.4), climate (13.2), ocean acidification targets (14.2, 14.3), and the Paris Agreement [68 ,69 ]. Further, the EPR reactors are a new, efficient, and reliable technology, resulting in synergies with infrastructure (9.4), energy (7.1, 7.3), and resource efficiency targets(8.4, 12.2) [70] . Possible synergies with poverty (1.1, 1.2, 1.4) and economy targets (8.3, 8.5, 8.6) are a result of the expectation that the project will bring economic benefits to the surrounding area via increased jobs [50] . Overall, these synergies emphasize the benefits of the technology chosen for the project scope and the possible economic benefits that follow. Furthermore, project developers have tried to implement a just and transparent operation of the project, with ample stakeholder consultation and public education efforts, generating synergies with equality targets and potentially having a positive social effect (5.1, 5.5, 10.1–10.3, 16.7) [71 ,72 ]. Similarly, many of the possible trade-offs are related to the nuclear technology. Uranium is a nonrenewable resource and thus, waste and pollution are associated with nuclear power plants. Important trade-offs were found related to pollution and its possible health effects (3.9, 12.5), sustainable consumption (12.1, 12.2, 12.4), and renewable energy (7.2) [53] . Further, the high project costs relative to other low-carbon technologies may be passed along to consumers and resulted in possible trade-offs with poverty reduction (1.1, 1.2, 1.4) and affordable energy targets (7.1) [67 ,73 ]. Tradeoffs with poverty targets could have a more significant effect on marginalized and poorer stakeholders through decreased affordability and energy poverty issues [74] . Finally, both the project and the uranium mining required for HPC operation will likely have ecosystem impacts, several of which are seen in countries outside of the UK; this generated several trade-offs with species and ecosystems on land and in water (6.6, 11.4, 14.1, 14.2, 14.5, 15.1, 15.3–15.5) [75 ,76 ]. In summary, the economic future of HPC is uncertain, and the characteristics that cause economic trade-offs may outweigh the synergies and cause social conflict. It must be noted that while consultation and public education were part of the project, ultimately UK taxpayers and local communities had limited influence on the decision to move forward with the HPC. It is also clear that environmental trade-offs of the project cannot be discounted, both in the immediate project and uranium source areas. Full results for how the project may impact local and international SDG attainment can be found in Annex 4.  6 Conclusions This research presents the SDGs-IAE Framework and tests it using two diverse projects. This tool fills a gap in current assessment frameworks by providing energy project-specific relationships to the SDG targets based on simple questions, and it could serve as a valuable starting point for diverse stakeholders in assessing the nature of these relationships, enabling a discussion of the project, and targeting more in-depth analyses for key interlinkages. By sharing the framework in this open-access perspective, the authors hope that more actors will validate and enrich the SDGs-IAE Framework by applying it to additional cases and by using the Github repository  to identify areas for refinement and improvement. In the case of the application to the GERD, the SDGs-IAE Framework highlights an opportunity for greater project-based collaboration with non-energy sectors. The outcomes from the framework also demonstrate that additional actions taken to ensure this electricity reaches rural communities without previous energy access will have important positive implications for poverty, health, and education. On the other hand, the SDGs-IAE Framework confirms a very well-documented, longstanding group of trade-offs related to transboundary water rights in the region. A continued effort to establish cooperation between Egypt and Ethiopia and an agreeable reservoir-management strategy will be critical for the success of the project; the SDGs-IAE Framework illustrates that a failure to establish a consensus could have significant negative impacts for water, energy, and food resources in areas downstream. The analysis of the GERD case also highlights the need to include local communities’ voices in the decision-making process – especially for the displaced population. The SDGs-IAE Framework also provides a holistic view of the themes most often discussed in association with the HPC, while highlighting several issues that are not emphasized by current literature or available project documents. By questioning the user about ecosystem disturbance in the resource extraction phase, the tool reveals transboundary ecosystem trade-offs resulting from uranium mining. This aspect of the HPC is not addressed in project sustainability assessments and reveals an opportunity for the HPC to work with suppliers to lessen its overall environmental impact. The issue of long-term climate resilience is also highlighted by questions about consideration of future weather and climate patterns. Though measures to protect the HPC against rising sea levels are well documented in sustainability assessments, resilience to other events, including other climate-change related events, are not emphasized. Finally, high project costs could have the largest impact on the poorest citizens by affecting energy affordability and thus exacerbating energy poverty. For the two considered case studies, the tool shows the complex impacts that a project can have across the social, economic, and environmental aspects of sustainable development. It goes beyond any typical sustainability assessment by integrating these development aspects and identifying relationships with SDG targets that are relevant in a given project context. By evaluating projects across the full spectrum of the SDGs, the use of this framework should enable a structured inclusion of social, institutional and environmental aspects in energy project assessments, opposed to the often adopted focus on techno-economic parameters [77 ,78 ]. Future work will attempt to overcome a set of limitations. Though the tool is intended to apply widely to projects of various types, not all energy resources have been considered as of this iteration of the framework. As additional cases are considered outside of what is presently available, these can be added, together with any synergies and/or trade-offs that result automatically from the selection of energy project type (e.g. hydropower, nuclear, etc.). Improvements of this nature will also rely heavily on input from other experts and project developers as they utilize the SDGs-IAE Framework. As discussed in the methods, only already-published gray and academic literature is used to characterize the interlinkages. Future iterations should also include possible missing interlinkages as new literature becomes available, and further customize the interlinkages depending on the type of project and the region. The use of indicators or additional quantitative research regarding the strength of the correlations between social and economic targets and energy access could also help generate more targeted questions for identifying first- and second-degree interactions in this space, as suggested by Santika et al. [6] . Lastly, it may be beneficial for updated versions of the tool to include an output of recommendations for which future actions can be taken to capitalize on synergies, and avoid trade-offs, including but not limited to conducting further quantitative exploration of specific synergies and trade-offs after this preliminary analysis. For example, projects with synergies and trade-offs identified by this tool related to water and agriculture may benefit from analysis using the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus tool or CLEWS (climate, land-use, energy, and water systems) scenario modeling (e.g. [79 ,80 ]). Ultimately, the SDGs-IAE Framework is the first edition of a continuously evolving tool. It is the intention of the authors to continue improving the tool based on new case studies, user feedback, and incorporation of additional expert knowledge; so that in the future it could be considered an established tool for energy project sustainability assessments. In its current form, the SDGs-IAE Framework can already be used to better understand interactions between energy projects and the SDGs and to enhance dialog across sectors and governing bodies for holistic energy project development. **Any data that support the findings of this study are included within the article.
