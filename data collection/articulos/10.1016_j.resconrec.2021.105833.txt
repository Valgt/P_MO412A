                  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) take the global challenges into a new phase, calling for reasonable resources management from holistic perspectives. This study develops a novel integrated modelling framework for sustainable agricultural energy-water-food nexus (EWFN) management, with the objectives of maximum social welfare of water resources allocation, maximum hydroelectric generation, maximum grain crop production, maximum positive farmland ecosystem service value, and minimum negative farmland ecosystem service value. The proposed framework is capable of: (1) balancing benefit efficiency and allocation equity using social welfare function; (2) reconciling conflicting targets among socio-economic, resource, and eco-environmental spheres; (3) generating sustainable water and land resources allocation strategies considering complex and uncertain environment. The proposed model was applied to the Zhanghe Reservoir irrigation area, central China. Flexible water and land resources allocation schemes among different sectors, crops, and periods were generated, as well as managerial insights into what efforts should be done were provided for decision-makers. After optimization, efficiency-equity tradeoff was balanced with social welfare index reaching [0.94, 0.99]. Optima results show that GHGs emission contributed majority of the total loss, which cannot be totally neutralized by carbon sequestration, causing negative eco-environmental impacts of [2.3, 3.4] × 108 CNY. The proposed model performs well on generating robust and coordinated solutions according to scenarios analysis and models comparison. The proposed approach has potential on achieving SDGs in agricultural EWFN system, and is portable to other agriculture-centered areas suffering from similar resources crisis.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) take the global challenges into a new phase, calling for reasonable resources management from holistic perspectives. This study develops a novel integrated modelling framework for sustainable agricultural energy-water-food nexus (EWFN) management, with the objectives of maximum social welfare of water resources allocation, maximum hydroelectric generation, maximum grain crop production, maximum positive farmland ecosystem service value, and minimum negative farmland ecosystem service value. The proposed framework is capable of: (1) balancing benefit efficiency and allocation equity using social welfare function; (2) reconciling conflicting targets among socio-economic, resource, and eco-environmental spheres; (3) generating sustainable water and land resources allocation strategies considering complex and uncertain environment. The proposed model was applied to the Zhanghe Reservoir irrigation area, central China. Flexible water and land resources allocation schemes among different sectors, crops, and periods were generated, as well as managerial insights into what efforts should be done were provided for decision-makers. After optimization, efficiency-equity tradeoff was balanced with social welfare index reaching [0.94, 0.99]. Optima results show that GHGs emission contributed majority of the total loss, which cannot be totally neutralized by carbon sequestration, causing negative eco-environmental impacts of [2.3, 3.4] × 108  CNY. The proposed model performs well on generating robust and coordinated solutions according to scenarios analysis and models comparison. The proposed approach has potential on achieving SDGs in agricultural EWFN system, and is portable to other agriculture-centered areas suffering from similar resources crisis.

Aiming to tackle global challenges, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 were adopted by the United Nations (2015)  and agreed upon by 193 countries, containing the goals with respect to food (SDG 2), water (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), climate change (SDG 13), and ecosystem (SDG 15). The SDGs challenge managers to transform the way they manage resources towards a more sustainable one. However, the operation and implementation are far from straightforward, requiring holistic approaches to generate comprehensive solutions. The nexus approaches stand out among numerous integrated approaches, by identifying connections and synergies, detecting trade-offs, and unveiling unexpected consequences (Liu et al., 2018 ). The nexus concept was firstly used in the Food-Energy Nexus in 1983, and has aroused quite vivid debate after the Bonn Conference in 2011 (Hoff, 2011 ). The most frequently application is exploration of energy-water-food nexus (EWFN), using the methods of life cycle assessment (Al-Ansari et al., 2015 ), input-output model (Deng et al., 2020 ), footprint assessment (Lu et al., 2021 ), econometric model (Ozturk, 2015 ), and system dynamic model (Naderi et al., 2021 ). Successfully uncovering connections among EWFN system fosters opportunities for optimization-based management of energy, water, and food resources and achieving SDGs that interconnect with EWFN directly and indirectly. Based on these researches, some scholars are underway to sustainable management of EWFN using mathematical modelling approaches. For example, Zhang and Vesselinov (2017)  established an integrated model framework to manage EWFN consistent with real-world management scenarios. Cost-effective decisions for optimal nexus management were provided for stakeholders. Yu et al. (2020)  developed a multi-level inexact optimization model for managing the EWFN in Henan province, China. Managerial insights were gained for hierarchical decision-makers concerning water and land resources allocation, energy consumption, fertilizer and pesticide utilization, and system benefits. Ji et al. (2020)  proposed a hybrid inexact optimization model for managing EWFN system considering decision-makers’ risk tolerance under uncertainty. Valuable insights on water-land resources allocation and energy supply were provided while balancing system benefit and risk attitude. However, optimization-based management approaches of EWFN, especially EWFN in agricultural system, are in their infancy. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have managed agricultural EWFN considering comprehensive elements associated with socio-economic, resource, and eco-environmental impacts simultaneously. To improve upon previous modelling frameworks, some endeavors have been done in this study as explained below. Firstly, efficiency and equity are two major principles which reasonable resources allocation needs to adhere to (Brechet et al., 2013 ; Yao et al, 2020 ). Efficiency refers to taking fully advantages of limited resources, to create outputs and social wealth as best as possible, while equity focused on allocating resources to each member fairly and reasonably. It is in a dilemma of how to balance high aggregate level of benefits against equitable resources distribution, which called efficiency-equity tradeoff (Mæstad and Norheim, 2012 ). Social welfare function (SWF), deriving from welfare economics, provide a potential way out of this classic dilemma by quantifying the relationship between efficiency and equity as mathematical functions (Dolan and Tsuchiya, 2009 ). In agricultural EWFN system, water and land resources are basic natural resources to food production and energy generation, facing a growing crisis of shortage. Reasonable allocation of limited water and land resources in accordance with above principles are priority areas for EWFN management in agricultural system. Hence, SWF is firstly introduced to describe efficiency-equity tradeoff and seek for balanced schemes in water and land resources distribution issues. Additionally, the equilibrium parameter is integrated with SWF to characterize varying preferences on weights of equity and efficiency, which are associated with policy makers’ attitudes and social development levels. Secondly, another crucial principle of resources allocation is sustainability, which refers to satisfying current resources demands without affecting future generations (Liu et al., 2015 ). In other word, sustainable water and land allocation solutions are capable of meeting current food and energy demands and maintaining ecosystem stability for subsequent productivity simultaneously (Hu et al, 2016 ). Ecosystem service valuation method has been proposed to quantify the impacts of human activities on ecosystem (Costanza et al., 1997 ). Whilst the large-scale ecosystem service has been well assessed (Mirghaed et al., 2020 ; Zeng et al, 2020 ; Cui et al., 2019 ), equally attention should be paid to the quantification of multiple ecosystem services from agricultural farmland, which is closely interrelated with agricultural EWFN management. Farmland ecosystem is a complex natural-artificial ecosystem, which not only provides positive services including provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural (Carpenter et al, 2009 ; Liu et al, 2016 ), but also has negative impacts on global warming and water pollution (Bennett et al, 2010 ). Maintaining farmland ecosystem stability calls for clear understanding of how ecosystem responds to water and land allocation, and when ecosystem service value is maximized. Accordingly, this study integrates farmland ecosystem service value (FESV) into general optimization framework, to reveal connections, synergies, and tradeoffs among multiple service functions, as well as identify ecosystem-based water and land allocation solutions. Thirdly, in real world, sustainable management of agricultural EWFN is challenged by a variety of uncertainties and complexities. For example, uncontrollable hydrological elements, fluctuating socio-economic parameters, and imprecise estimated modelling inputs lead to the necessity of uncertain optimization techniques (Xie et al., 2018 ). Different types of uncertain parameters require different uncertain programming methods for accurate characterization. Interval mathematical programming (IMP) deals with imprecise parameters expressed as interval numbers with the lower and upper bound, without known probability distribution or membership functions, such as market price, agricultural inputs, and crop-related coefficients (Zhang et al., 2020 ). Fuzzy mathematical programming addresses vagueness associated with human subjective judgments, expressed as fuzzy sets (FS) with membership function, for example environmental capacity (Yue et al., 2020a ). However, there may be hesitation or uncertainty in deciding membership function, calling for the extension of traditional FS to intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) (Atanassov, 1986 ; Li et al., 2017 ). Generally, IFS is superior to FS in terms of practicability and flexibility, determined by membership function, non-membership function and hesitancy degree simultaneously (Deschrijver and Kerre, 2007 ). Both IMP and IFS are applied to handle multiple uncertainties existed in agricultural EWFN systems. Besides, Stewart model is used to describe how water shortage affect crop productivity during different periods (Stewart et al., 1976 ), as well as mixed-integer non-linear programming is adopted to identify whether and when external water should be transferred for compensatory irrigation water demand. Furthermore, stochastic multi-objective programming is used, which can not only deal with random water inflow levels, but also reconcile contradictory objectives of socio-economic, resource, and eco-environmental dimensions. Finally, a novel inexact multi-objective modelling framework is proposed for sustainable EWFN management in agricultural system, incorporating with SWF, FESV, IFS, IMP, mixed-integer non-linear programming into stochastic multi-objective programming (see Fig. 1  ). The prime objective of this study is to seek for coordinated water and land resources allocation solutions, and consequently achieve SDGs concerning efficiency-equity tradeoff, food security, energy security, and farmland ecosystem sustainability. Afterwards, the modelling framework is applied to the case study in the Zhanghe Reservoir irrigation area, central China, to verify its feasibility and practicality. Optimal results can provide managerial insights into tradeoffs among water and land resources allocation policies, social welfare, resource security, and farmland environment.  2 Methodology 2.1 Triangular intuitionistic fuzzy sets (TIFNs) Following FS theory introduced by Zadeh (1965) , Atanassov (1986)  proposed IFS theory to extend traditional FS by incorporating the hesitation in the membership degree. For an IFSA I   ˜  = { < x , μ A I   ˜   ( x )  , ν A I   ˜   ( x )  > : x ∈ X }    , where μ A I   ˜   ( x )     and ν A I   ˜   ( x )     represent the degree of membership and non-membership of the element x . h ( x )  = 1 − μ A I   ˜   ( x )  − ν A I   ˜   ( x )     represents the degree of hesitation of the element x . It will become an intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) when following conditions hold: i) there existx 1  , x 2  ∈ X   such thatμ A I   ˜   ( x )  = 1   andν A I   ˜   ( x )  = 1   ; ii) both membership function and non-membership function are piecewise continuous to [0, 1]; iii) it is convex in the universe of discourse X . In this study, triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs) were used because they were computationally simpler than other IFNs. According to Singh & Yadav (2015 , 2017 , 2018 ), a TIFNB I   ˜   can be denoted by( b 1  , b 2  , b 3  ; b 1   ′  , b 2  , b 3   ′  )   , whereb 1   ′  ≤ b 1  ≤ b 2  ≤ b 3  ≤ b 3   ′    , with its membership function and non-membership function expressed as(1a) μ A I   ˜   ( x )  = { x − b 1   b 2  − b 1    ,  i f  b 1  ≤ x < b 2     1 ,  i f  x = b 2        x − b 3   b 2  − b 3    ,  i f  b 2  ≤ x < b 3     0 ,  o t h e r w i s e          (1b) ν A I   ˜   ( x )  = { b 2  − x  b 2  − b 1   ′    ,  i f  b 1   ′  ≤ x < b 2     0 ,  i f  x = b 2        x − b 2   b 3   ′  − b 2    ,  i f  b 2  ≤ x < b 3   ′     1 ,  o t h e r w i s e           According to Kumar et al. (2011) , the α -cutB α I   ˜   , β -cut B β I   ˜    and (α, β )-cutB α , β  I   ˜    of a TIFN are defined as(2a) B α I   ˜  = [ x ∈ X : μ B I   ˜   ( x )  ≥ α  ]  , ∀ α ∈ [ 0 , 1  ]      (2b) B β I   ˜  = [ x ∈ X : ν B I   ˜   ( x )  ≤ β  ]  , ∀ β ∈ [ 0 , 1  ]      (2c) B α , β  I   ˜  = [ x ∈ X : μ B I   ˜   ( x )  ≥ α , ν B I   ˜   ( x )  ≤ β  ]  , ∀ α , β ∈ [ 0 , 1  ]  , α + β ≤ 1      Based on above membership function and non-membership function, the α -cutB α I   ˜   , β -cut B β I   ˜    and (α, β )-cutB α , β  I   ˜    of B I   ˜   can be calculated by(3a) B α I   ˜  = [ b 1  + ( b 2  − b 1   )  α , b 3  − ( b 3  − b 2   )  α  ]  , α ∈ [ 0 , 1  ]      (3b) B β I   ˜  = [ b 2  − ( b 2  − b 1   ′   )  β , b 2  + ( b 3   ′  − b 2   )  β  ]  , β ∈ [ 0 , 1  ]      (3c) B α , β  I   ˜  = [ b 1  + ( b 2  − b 1   )  α , b 3  − ( b 3  − b 2   )  α  ]  ∩ [ b 2  − ( b 2  − b 1   ′   )  β , b 2  + ( b 3   ′  − b 2   )  β  ]  , α + β ≤ 1 , & ∀ α , β ∈ [ 0 , 1  ]        2.2 Optimization model 2.2.1 Notations To clearly present the model, notations of the optimization model are presented in Table 1  .  2.2.2 Objective functions 2.2.2.1 Maximum social welfare of water resources allocation Following Amartya Sen's SWF (Sen, 1987 ), equilibrium parameter λ  is introduced to realize balanced resources allocation in different development levels. When λ  equal to 1, it means the model considered economic efficiency only; on the contrary, when λ  equal to 0, it means only allocation equity is taken account. The efficiency function is defined by the total benefit of water use by all sectors dividing the maximum attainable benefit. The equity function is expressed as the arithmetic square root of the product of coordination degree and fairness degree. Among them, coordination degree refers to the degree of difference in water allocation satisfaction among different water use sectors, and fairness degree is expressed as the degree of difference in per capita land allocation in different subareas. Gini coefficient (Gini, 1921 ), which falls in [0, 1], is applied to the measurement of water and land resources inequality in the model. The distribution is more equitable when Gini coefficient is smaller, and reach perfect equality when it equals to 0 (Hu et al, 2016 ). The specific objective function can be written as(4a) M a x  F 1 ±  = M a x ( F B e n e f i t  ±  )  λ  · ( 1 − G C o o r d i n a t i o n  ±  · G F a i r n e s s  ±     )  1 − λ       (4b) F B e n e f i t  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ k = 1  K  p h  · E C k  · W S k h  ±     E b e s t        (4c) G C o o r d i n a t i o n  ±  = 1 2 k ( ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ k = 1  K  p h  · W S k h  ±   W S max , k        )    · ∑ m = 1  K  ∑ n = 1  K  | ∑ h = 1  H  p h  · W S h m  ±   W S max , m      − ∑ h = 1  H  p h  · W S h n  ±   W S max , n       |       (4d) G F a i r n e s s  ±  = 1 2 k ( ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A i j h  ±  P O P i        )    · ∑ s = 1  I  ∑ q = 1  I  | ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A  s j h  ±     P O P s    − ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A q j h  ±     P O P q     |       (4e) W S k h  ±  = ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ t = 1  T  E T a , i t h  ±  · A i j h  ±    , ∀ h , k = 5 , j = 1       2.2.2.2 Maximum hydroelectricity generation Hydroelectricity, as a significant renewable (EIA, 2019 ), contributes to ensuring energy security (SDG 7) and mitigating global warming. Hence, the second objective function is maximization of hydroelectric generation, which can be written as(5) M a x  F 2 ±  =  M a x  ∑ h = 1  H  p h  · H W h y   · W S k h  ±   , k = 4       2.2.2.3 Maximum grain crop production Increment of food demand, caused by rapid industrialization and urbanization, reinforces the necessity of ensuring abundant food production. The objective of maximization of grain crop production can be expressed as(6a) M a x  F 3 ±  = M a x  ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A i j h  ±  · Y i j  ±     , j = 1 , 3     (6b) Y i j  ±  = { Y m ±  [ 1 − ∑ t = 1  T  b t  ( E T max , t   − E T a , i t h  ±   E T max , t     )    ]  ,   j = 1    Y i j  ±  ,   j ≥ 1            2.2.2.4 Maximum positive farmland ecosystem service value Farmland ecosystem significantly contributes to human well-being, both directly (such as supply of raw material and agricultural products) and indirectly (including carbon sequestration, oxygen release, atmosphere purification, water conservation, flood regulation, nutrient cycling, and so on). How to correctly measure the service value, as well as benefit from farmland ecosystem service functions through reasonable farmland management, challenges both scholars and managers. Thus, the fourth objective is to maximum positive farmland ecosystem service value, which can be written as(7a) M a x  F 4 ±  = M a x  ( V s r m  ±  + V s a p  ±  + V c a r b o n  ±  + V o x y g e n  ±  + V a t m o s  ±  + V c o n s e r  ±  + V f l o o d  ±  + V n u t r i e n t  ±   )      (7b) V s r m  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A i j h  ±  · Y i j  ±  · δ c o l l e c t , j  ±  · δ r a t e , j  ±  · r s t r a w  ±     · P S ±      (7c) V s a p  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  1  p h  · A i j h  ±  · P C  j   ±  · Y i j  ±         (7d) V c a r b o n  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  1.63 · p h  · A i j h  ±  · Y i j  ±   /  r h a r v e s t , j  ±   · ( 1 − r w a t e r , j  ±   )  · 27.27 % · P C S        (7e) V o x y g e n  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  1.19 · p h  · A i j h  ±  · Y i j  ±   /  r h a r v e s t , j  ±   · ( 1 − r w a t e r , j  ±   )  · P O A        (7f) V a t m o s  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A i j h  ±  · ( c S O 2    ω S O 2    + c H F   ω H F   + c N O x    ω N O x    + c d u s t   ω d u s t    )         (7g) V c o n s e r  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A i j h  ±  · A P R h  · r i n      · C W     (7h) V f l o o d  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  1  p h  · A i j h  ±  · P R E ±  · l ±         (7i) V n u t r i e n t  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A i j h  ±  · Y i j  ±   /  r h a r v e s t , j  ±   · ( 1 − r  w a t e r , j    ±   )  · ( ρ N , j   + ρ P , j   + ρ K , j    )     · P P ±       More specifically, carbon sequestration and oxygen release are achieved through photosynthesis of green plants, which converts solar energy, carbon dioxide and water to sugar and oxygen, expressed as6 n C O 2  + 6 n H 2  O → n C 6  H 12  O 6  + 6 n O 2  → ( C 6  H 10  O 5   )  n  + n H 2  O + 6 n O 2    . According to the photosynthesis equation, for every 1.00 g of dry matter accumulated by green plants, 1.63 g of CO2  will be fixed, while 1.19 g of O2  will be released. That can explain the coefficient of 1.63 in formula 7(d)  and 1.19 in formula 7(e) . Besides, in formula 7(d) , 27.27% refers to the proportion of C in CO2 .  2.2.2.5 Minimum negative farmland ecosystem service value In addition to abovementioned positive ecosystem services value, some negative ecosystem service functions exist in the process of farming activities, including water resources consumption, GHGs emission, and agricultural non-point source pollution. Specifically, GHGs emission includes the emission of CO2 , N2 O, and CH4 . Among which, the emission load of CO2  was derived from agricultural activities, including usage of fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural machinery, agricultural film, and irrigation electricity. The emission load of N2 O was mainly from the fertilizer application, nitrogen volatilization, and nitrogen leaching. CH4  was mainly emitted from paddy field, associated with soil properties, climate, and tillage methods. Agricultural non-point source pollution was estimated using the alternative cost method, considering the loss of nitrogen fertilizer, phosphate fertilizer, compound fertilizer, and pesticide. The loss of potash fertilizer is ignored, because potassium element is pollution-free to the environment (Cao, 2011 ). Compound fertilizer was converted into pure TN and P2 O5  by 40% and 32%, respectively, while P2 O5  was converted into pure TP by 43.66%. The fifth objective is to minimum negative farmland ecosystem services value, which can be presented as(8a) M i n  F 5 ±  = M i n  ( V c o n s u m  ±  + V G H G  ±  + V l o s s  ±   )      (8b) V c o n s u m  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  1  ∑ t = 1  T  p h  · A i j h  ±  · ( C W · R W i t h  ±   μ i   + C W · I W i t h  ±   η  + C E · δ i t h   · T W i t h  ±   μ i    )          (8c) V G H G  ±  = ( E C O 2   ±  + 25 · E C H 4   ±  + 298 · E N 2  O  ±   )  · P C S     (8d) E C O 2   ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A i j h  ±  · ε  j         (8e) E N 2  O  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A i j h  ±  · ϕ j         (8f) E C H 4   ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  1  p h  · A i j h  ±  · ϕ C H 4           (8g) V l o s s  ±  = ∑ h = 1  H  ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ j = 1  J  p h  · A i j h  ±  · ( ε  f N   d f N , i  ±  + ε  f P   d f P , i  ±  + ε  f  d f C , i  ±  + ε  p  d p , i  ±   )     · P P ±         2.2.3 Constraints 2.2.3.1 Water supply constraints These constraints require that water allocation from each water source should not be larger than corresponding water supply availability, and can be presented as(9a) ∑ k = 1  4  W S k h  ±   μ i = 1    + ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ k = 5  5  ∑ h = 1  H  A i j h  ±  · R W i t h  ±   μ i     ≤ R Q h   I   ˜  , ∀ h , j = 1     (9b) A i j h  ±  · I W i t h  ±  ≤ P R t h    I   ˜  · A I i ±  · η , ∀ i , t , h , j = 1     (9c) ∑ i = 1  I  ∑ t = 1  T  δ i t h   · A i j h  ±  · T W i t h  ±   μ i    ≤ T Q I   ˜  , ∀ h , j = 1       2.2.3.2 Field water balance constraints These constraints describe the change of water layer depth considering the process of recharge and discharge. By introducing the maximum and minimum water layer depth, the actual water depth can be controlled in a suitable level. The constraints can be presented as(10a) H i t h  ±  = H i ( t − 1  )  h  ±  + P R t h    I   ˜  + R W i t h  ±  + I W i t h  ±  + δ i t h   · T W i t h  ±  − E T a , i t h  ±  − D W i t h  ±  − S t ±  , ∀ i , t , h     (10b) H min t   ≤ H i t h  ±  ≤ H max t   , ∀ i , t , h       2.2.3.3 Land policy constraints Allocated land resources should be within the scope of allowable land area.

The constraints can be written as(12a) W S min , k   ≤ W S k h  ±  ≤ W S max , k   , ∀ k , h     (12b)  E T min , t   ≤ E T a , i t h  ±  ≤ E T max , t   , ∀ i , t , h       2.2.3.5 Hydroelectric constraint In each hydrological year, hydroelectricity generated from water must not exceed the power station capacity and should satisfy the minimum electricity demand. The constraint is presented as(13) 1001.36 ≤ H W h y   · W S k h  ±  ≤ 8760 · C a h y   , ∀ h , k = 4       2.2.3.6 Binary constraint All the binary variables are either 0 or 1 to determine whether and when water transfer is needed. The constraint is expressed as(14)  δ i t h   = ( 0 , if external water is not transferred     1 , if external water is transferred       , ∀ i , t , h       2.2.3.7 Non-negative constraints All the decision variables in the model should not be negative. These constraints are written as(15a) T W i t h  ±  ≥ 0 , ∀ i , t , h      (15b) D W i t h  ±  ≥ 0 , ∀ i , t , h      (15c)  I W i t h  ±  ≥ 0 , ∀ i , t , h      (15d) R W i t h  ±  ≥ 0 , ∀ i , t , h          2.3 Solution method The proposed optimization model is a TIFNs-based interval stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model. The key to the solution is how to transform the uncertain multi-objective programming model into a series of deterministic single-objective programming sub-models. Firstly, the TIFNs existed in objective functions and constraints should be converted into interval forms based on (α, β )-cut measure. After that, an interval multi-objective programming model was obtained. Secondly, the weighted minimum deviation method was used to transform the model into an interval single-objective model (Zhang et al., 2019 ). Thirdly, the two-step interactive algorithm can be adopted to decompose the model into two deterministic sub-models (Huang et al., 1992 ). The specific solution steps are summarized as follows:Step 1: Give different efficiency-equity coordination coefficients (λ ) and (α, β ) value.  Step 2: Transform TIFNs into interval forms with given (α, β ) value. And then, express each interval set x ±  = [ x −  , x +   ]     as{ x −  + ε  ( x +  − x −   )  | 0 ≤ ε  ≤ 1   }   .  Step 3: Calculate the maximum and minimum optimal value of each single objectivef 1 max  , f 1 min  , f 2 max  , f 2 min  , f 3 max  , f 3 min  , f 4 max  , f 4 min  , f 5 max    , andf 5 min   .  Step 4: Obtain a reformulated interval single-objective programming model using the weighted minimum deviation method as:(16) min F ±  = ϖ 1  · f 1 max  − f 1 ±   f 1 max  − f 1 min    + ϖ 2  · f 2 max  − f 2 ±   f 2 max  − f 2 min    + ϖ 3  · f 3 max  − f 3 ±   f 3 max  − f 3 min    + ϖ 4  · f 4 max  − f 4 ±   f 4 max  − f 4 min    + ϖ 5  · f 5 ±  − f 5 min   f 5 max  − f 5 min           where ϖ 1  . . . ϖ 5    depict the weights of the objectivesf 1 ±  . . . f 5 ±     respectively, and ϖ 1  + ϖ 2  + ϖ 3  + ϖ 4  + ϖ 5  = 1   .Step 5: Decompose above interval single-objective model into the lower-bound sub-model and the upper-bound sub-model, based on the interactive algorithm.  Step 6: Solve the lower bound sub-model and obtain corresponding alternatives under each scenario.  Step 7: Solve the upper bound sub-model based on the solutions obtained from step 6. And then, generate final solutions by combining solutions from two sub-models under different scenarios.      3 Model application 3.1 Overview of the study region The study region focuses on the Zhanghe Reservoir irrigation area (ZRIA) located in the western part of the Jianghan Plain, central China. It contains three subareas: Jingmen subarea, Jingzhou subarea, and Dangyang subarea. ZRIA is the largest irrigation area in Hubei Province, with designed irrigation area of 1.737 × 105  ha. It is a vital commodity grain base which yields good profits, mainly benefited by subtropical continental monsoon climate, high-fertility soil condition, abundant water-fertilizer supply, and well-equipped agricultural facilities. The main farming pattern is middle rice and winter rape rotation, while winter wheat grows in a few areas. However, winter rape and winter wheat generally do not require irrigation. The Zhanghe Reservoir is the key water supply source of ZRIA, which is operated for irrigation, domestic water use, industrial water supply, flood control, and hydropower generation. Besides, plenty of general reservoirs and ponds are operated independently from the Zhanghe Reservoir to support on-demand agricultural irrigation. Several problems concerning sustainability in ZRIA call for special attention as: (1) How to balance economic benefit efficiency and water allocation equity among multiple water users? (2) How to satisfy increasing demand of water, food, and energy with limited water and land resources? (3) How to avoid irrigation shortage caused by water supply shortage and variability? (4) How to quantitatively and comprehensively analyze farmland ecosystem service in the irrigation area? (5) How to address complex uncertainties associated with natural condition and human activities in the management process? These issues lead to the necessity to apply the proposed inexact optimization model for water and land resources allocation. The developed model is to allocate water resources (water from the Zhangehe Reservoir, general reservoirs, ponds, and other region) and land resources (rice, winter rape, and winter wheat) to different water use sectors (domestic, industrial, ecological, agricultural, and hydroelectric) to different crop stages in different subareas (Jingmen subarea, Jingzhou Subarea, and Dangyang subarea).  3.2 Data collection and processing Data for the proposed model mainly involves hydrological data and socio-economic data. All these data (see Table S1-S5 in Supplementary Materials) were obtained from statistical yearbook of Jingmen city, Jingzhou city, and Yichang city, Tuanlin meteorological station, Statistics of Irrigation Accounts in ZRIA, field investigations by Hubei Zhanghe Project Administration Bureau, government reports, and published references (Chen et al., 2017 ; Cao, 2011 ; Hou, 2017 ; Liu, 2018 ; Jiang, 2020 ; Yue et al., 2020b ). Hydrological data included water supply and crop water demand. Precipitation, reservoir water supply, and external water supply were expressed as TIFNs based on long series statistical data. These data were divided into wet, normal, and dry conditions using frequency analysis method, with the frequencies of 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively. Crop water demand equaled the value of crop evapotranspiration, which was calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration (ET0  ) with crop coefficient (Kc  ). The Penman-Monteith equation was used to estimate the daily reference evapotranspiration (Allen et al., 1998 ). And then, reference evapotranspiration in each crop growth stage equaled the cumulative value of daily value. Socio-economic data including crop market price, water price, water use efficiency, land resources data, non-agricultural water demand, dosage of fertilizers, population, and crop-related coefficients were obtained from reliable sources. However, a certain parameter might have different value from different data sources or during different periods. These imprecise parameters were expressed as interval numbers under 90% confidence to describe uncertain information for the reason of its high computational efficiency. Economic benefit coefficients of different sectors were calculated by contribution coefficient method (Li, 2017 ). According to The First National Survey of Pollution Sources—Agricultural Pollution Sources , loss coefficient of total nitrogen was 1.12%, loss coefficient of total phosphorus was 0.28%, and loss coefficient of pesticide was ignored because of its small value. Price of carbon sequestration was 622.53 CNY/t, which equaled to the average of value estimated by Swedish carbon tax and afforestation cost method. Price of oxygen release was 376.47 CNY/t, which equaled to the average of value estimated by industrial oxygen production method and afforestation cost method. In ZRIA, Jingmen subarea had multiple water use sectors, while other two subareas only required agricultural irrigation water supply.  3.3 Objective weights Assigning different weights to objectives resulted in different resources allocation solutions. In this study, typical analytic hierarchy process method was used to generate weights scenarios of objectives. The steps are displayed as follows.(1) Build the hierarchy. The five objectives were classified into three dimensions, which is socio-economic dimension (F1 ), resource dimension (F2  and F3 ), and eco-environmental dimension (F4  and F5 ).  (2) Construct pairwise comparison matrices( a 11   a 12   ⋯  a 1 n     a 21   a 21   ⋯  a 2 n     ⋯  ⋯  ⋯  ⋯   a n 1    a n 1    ⋯  a n n      )   . Where, N denotes the matrix size. The Pairwise comparison judgment matrices were established based on a semantic 9-point scale criterion (Saaty, 1990 ). In this step, four decision-making preferences scenarios were set as: (i) Scenario 1: Three dimensions were given equal importance. (ii) Scenario 2: Objectives of socio-economic dimension was of prime importance. (iii) Scenario 3: Objectives of resource dimension was given the most important order. (iv) Scenario 4: Objectives of eco-environmental dimension had the highest weights.  (3) Calculate the weight vector of the matrices. First, calculate the product of relative weights of each objectiveb i  = ∏ j = 1  n  a i j     . Then, calculate its n-th rootP i  = b i  n    . Finally, the weight vector was obtained by normalizing the vector P  .  (4) Check the consistency of weights. First, calculate the maximum eigenvalueλ m   . Then the consistency index was calculated as C I = ( λ m  − n  )  / ( n − 1  )    (Gdoura et al., 2015 ; Li et al., 2020 ). The consistency ratio was calculated byC R = C I / R I   , and RI  denotes the mean random consistency index (Zhang et al., 2018 ).    Detailed weight of each objective can be seen in Table 2  . The consistency ratios were all 0, less than 0.1, which were acceptable.   4 Results analysis and discussion 4.1 Optimal water and land resources allocation Fig. 2   presents the water resources utilization of domestic, industrial, ecological, hydroelectric, and agricultural sectors in different hydrological years, taking λ=0.5 and (α, β) = (0.5, 0.5) under weights scenario 1 as an example. From the figure, water allocated to hydroelectric sector was most sensitive to hydrological inflow variation, with [5.74, 6.11] × 108  m3  in wet year, [3.24, 3.38] × 108  m3  in normal year, and 0.80 × 108  m3  in dry year, generating [7.17, 7.64] × 107  kWh, [4.05, 4.23] × 107  kWh, and 1.00 × 107  kWh of electricity respectively. The maximum water demands of domestic and ecological sectors were satisfied in all hydrological years. The maximum industrial water demand can be met in both wet year and normal year, while actual water allocation equaled to its lower bound of water demand in dry year. The total amount of agricultural water utilization reached 4.36 × 108  m3  in wet year and normal year, and [2.53, 2.65] × 108  m3  in dry year. The economic efficiency of allocation schemes equaled [0.994, 0.997], very close to 1, meaning that the economic benefit was almost the perfect situation. The coordination degree was [0.025, 0.027], less than 0.1, meaning that the water allocation in different sectors was totally fair. It indicated that the optimal water resources allocation alternatives can achieve the tradeoff among efficiency and equity. Fig. 3   presents the specific components of agricultural water allocation. Because of subtropical continental monsoon climatic condition in ZRIA, precipitation in wet year can fully support agriculture without any irrigation. However, precipitation reduced significantly from wet year to normal year, calling for compensatory internal irrigation water (i.e. water from general reservoirs and ponds) to guarantee crop production. When inflow levels dropped from normal to dry, reservoir water and external water were allocated to avoid crop yield reduction caused by water scarcity. Majority limited reservoir water was allocated to Jingmen subarea, because of its higher water use coefficient among three subareas. Fig. 3  also displays crop yield in each hydrological year in each subarea, while Fig. 4   reveals how detailed water distribution resulted in different crop production. In both wet year and normal year, rice production can achieve its maximum potential yield because maximum crop water demand was met by sufficient irrigation water supply. The results highlighted the important roles of general reservoirs and ponds in storing precipitation and supplying water on-demand. It also indicated that there existed precipitation surplus after meeting basic crop water demand in wet year, which numerically equaled to the difference between water allocation in wet year and in normal year. In dry year, irrigation water was priority to heading stage, which was the most sensitive stage to water shortage according to water sensitive index in each growth stage. Optimal rice production were [7.45, 9.73] t/ha in Jingmen subarea, [7.45, 9.03] t/ha in Jingzhou subarea, and [7.96, 10.16] t/ha in Dangyang subarea. The yield difference between upper bound and lower bound was the largest in Dangyang subarea. That can be explained by its larger precipitation storage capacity causing greater internal water supply variation than other subareas. In summary, the results indicated that: 1) Allocating water in different hydrological years is necessary for handling large inter-annual inflow variation. 2) Applying reasonable water distribution schemes can avoid huge yield reduction caused by water shortage in key growth stage. 3) Some engineering measures for strengthening precipitation storage capacity and improving water use coefficient should be combined with management practices.  4.2 Analysis of farmland ecosystem service value Fig. 5   depicts the contribution of each farmland ecosystem service. The positive farmland ecosystem service value (SV) was [5.87, 7.36] billion CNY, the negative farmland ecosystem SV was [1.031, 1.035] billion CNY, accordingly the total farmland ecosystem SV was [4.839, 6.325] billion CNY. It should be noted that every 1 CNY SV generation was accompanied by 0.18 CNY negative SV, meaning a great loss of human well-being from farmland ecosystem. Detailed analysis of positive SV and negative SV was conducted below. Among the positive SV, provisioning SV was the major component, accounting for [53%, 56%] with [3.11, 4.10] billion CNY, owing to plentiful production of rice, rape, wheat and crop straw. Regulating SV had a proportion of [26%, 27%] to the total positive SV with the value of [1.61, 1.88] billion CNY, among which flood regulation had the highest contribution owing to great water storage capacity of paddy field. The SV of carbon sequestration and oxygen release also made up a great proportion of the total regulating SV. That is because the agricultural productivity in ZRIA was high, resulting great net primary productivity and large amount of carbon dioxide fixed and oxygen released. Among three crops, rice contributed majority (84.1%) of regulating SV, while taking up 58.5% of the total planting area. The positive SV of paddy field may not be reflected in several cases, such as water regulation would encounter failure in chronically rainless regions relying on artificial irrigation; and the function of buffering precipitation pressure would be not apparent in flood hazard-prone regions. Fortunately, the regulating SV of paddy field could be fully reflected in ZRIA, for the reasons of (1) abundant precipitation resources with an average annual precipitation of 899 mm; and (2) powerful flood regulation capacity of the Zhanghe Reservoir with total reservoir capacity of 2.113 billion cubic meters. The percentages of nutrient cycling SV was [19%, 20%], with [1.15, 1.37] billion CNY, which can not only guarantee the crop growth, but also support the renewal of soil fertility. The economic losses caused by water consumption, GHGs emission, and fertilizer loss were estimated as Fig. 5  shown. The loss caused by GHGs emission constituted an overwhelming proportion ([93.24%, 93.60%]) of the total loss with the SV of 9.65 × 108  CNY, even beyond the value of carbon sequestration of farmland (i.e. [6.25, 7.35] × 108  CNY). The main components of GHGs emission were displayed in Fig. 5 , with CO2  occupying 73.1%, CH4  occupying 23.4%, and N2 O occupying the rest part of 3.5%. The main sources of GHGs emission included fertilizer and pesticide application, diesel oil used for agricultural machinery, electricity used for irrigation and drainage, agricultural film used for dry crops, and so on. Therefore, efficient management of agricultural inputs would be conductive to diminish negative environmental impacts and maintain natural carbon cycling of farmland. The GHGs emission contribution ranks from high to low were rice of 67.4%, rape of 25.2%, and wheat of 7.3%. On the one hand, rice taken up a large percentage of planting acreage. On the other hand, plenty of methane was emitted by methanogens in paddy field. Taking paddy field as an example, it can be summarized that more paddy field would generate more economic profits owing to its provisioning service, regulating service, and supporting service, while bring about more economic loss caused by irreversible resources consumption and environmental pollution. The proposed optimization model was capable of quantifying connections, promoting synergies, and balancing trade-offs among multiple farmland ecosystem service functions. Optimal results could support sustainable agricultural management in a coordinated and environmental-friendly way.  4.3 Scenario analysis of optimal results Fig. 6   describes how optimal objectives vary considering different importance orders of objective functions. Detailed weights scenarios can be found in Table 2 . Taking F1  as an example, social welfare index under all scenarios was below the best value of 0.967, which was obtained only considering F1 . If social welfare was given priority (S2), the value was the highest of [0.962, 0.965], and if it was taken lightly (S3), the value fell in the lowest [0.917, 0.931], because these objective functions are contradictory. Specifically, considering F2  and F3  (S3) would reduce the social welfare due to low-benefit characterize of food and hydropower production. Considering the objectives of FESV (S4) would also reduce the social welfare. These indicated that socio-economic objective was in conflict with both resource objectives and eco-environmental objectives. Similar to F1 , F2  and F3  reached their highest when they were focused on. Especially, the highest food production, i.e. [9.16, 10.99] × 108  kg, was close to the best value of 11.02 × 108  kg obtained only considering F3 . However, the results of eco-environmental objectives were little sensitive to varying importance orders of objectives. The total FESV (i.e. the difference between positive and Negative FESV) reached its lowest when it was emphasized on. It can be inferred that the total FESV was influenced by relatively low food production under S4, because food supply was one of the most important components of total FESV. How the equilibrium parameter (λ =0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0) affected efficiency-equity tradeoff is shown in Fig. 7  . It can be divided into stage 1: λ ≥  0.5 and stage 2: λ ≤  0.5. At stage 1, benefit efficiency kept stable of 0.99. At stage 2, it experienced a downtrend as λ  decreased, reaching the minimum value of 0.89 when λ  = 0. During stage 1, the importance degree of economic benefit was higher than distribution equity, resulting in benefit-oriented allocation schemes. However, the economic benefit was quite close to the best situation in this stage. It indicated that the key of promoting economic development was not the weight given to economic efficiency, but the exploration of potential best benefit. In other word, there was little potential on promoting economic development unless enhancing total system resources inputs. During stage 2, the weight of allocation equity was larger than economic efficiency. The coordination degree exhibited a downtrend as λ  decreased, while fairness degree stayed constant at 0.17 after λ ≤  0.4. During stage 1, the maximum social welfare was 0.99 when λ  = 1, and then reduced as λ  declined, attributed by decreasing fairness degree. During stage 2, the social welfare index reduced as λ  decreased until reaching the bottle value of 0.94 at λ  = 0.2, and then climbed when λ  changed from 0.2 to 0. Optimal results showed that λ≥  0.4 was favorable, because the efficiency reached a high level with equity degree staying within a suitable scope. Furthermore, the variation ranges of these indexes were small, demonstrating that optimization model can provide robust solutions considering efficiency-equity tradeoff. In the model, TIFNs were used to express highly uncertain water supply availability. Different (α, β ) corresponded to different amounts of total available water. The above results were obtained under a certain (α, β ) value, which was (α =0.5, β =0.5). To further explore how variations of water supply affected optimal results, several (α, β ) were considered as follows: (0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.3), (0.1, 0.5), (0.1, 0.7), (0.1, 0.9), (0.3, 0.1), (0.3, 03), (0.3, 0.5), (0.3, 0.7), (0.5, 0.1), (0.5, 0.3), and (0.5, 0.5). The optimal results under different (α, β ) can be seen in Fig. 8  . Taking hydroelectricity generation as an example, the upper bound decreased with increasing membership levels, whilst the lower bound increased with the same change. It was directly related with the shape of the membership function of TIFNs. A bigger value of α  represents a lower probability of fuzzy events occurrence, corresponding to a lower range of interval input parameters. On the contrary, the upper bound of hydropower increased with increasing non-membership levels, whilst the lower bound decreased with the same situation. Crop yield varied slightly with the changing (α, β ), because water supply amounts in both wet year and normal year were sufficient causing a robust total crop yield. Two main factors of total FESV were crop planting area and crop production, which were little sensitive to changing water supply. Accordingly, the total FESV displayed little change with changing (α, β ) value. Flexible optimal results under combinations of membership levels, non-membership levels, and hesitation degrees, can help managers choose the appropriate scenarios based on their own preferences. To verify the performance of proposed optimization model, six optimization models were coded and solved with the same constraints, the results were obtained and shown in Fig. 9  . “M1” was a single objective optimization model that only the first objective of the proposed model was considered. “M2” was a single objective optimization model that only the second objective of the proposed model was considered, and so on. “M6” was the proposed multi-objective optimization model. It is obvious that all objectives of proposed model were within the range of maximum and minimum value, while the results of single-objective models were extremely high or low. Taking M2 as an example, the hydropower can achieve its best value, while obtain the worst crop yield and positive FESV. M5 performed weakly on all objectives except the objective of negative FESV. It implied that concentrating on one aspect only might cause considerable negative consequences on other aspects. Among five single-objective models, M1 obtained the closest results to the proposed model. Compared with M1, the proposed model achieved improvement in crop production, positive FESV, and negative FESV of approximately 5.57%, 2.99%, and 9.41% respectively, although slightly reduction in social welfare index (0.28%) and hydropower generation (0.22%). Therefore, the proposed multi-objective model is superior to other models on identifying coordinated solutions.  4.4 Discussion The developed optimization model was dedicated to achieving SDGs in agricultural EWFN system through optimal water and land allocation. The proposed model can balance conflicting concerns among socio-economic, resource, and eco-environmental spheres, with connections, synergies, and tradeoffs among EWFN being quantified and optimized. Although multi-objective programming framework has been widely used, this was an improvement on balancing more comprehensive considerations in irrigated area. The objectives of proposed model included maximization of social welfare of water allocation (from Eqs. 4(a)  to 4(e) ), maximization of hydroelectricity generation (Eq. 5 ), maximization of grain crop production (Eqs. 6(a)  and 6(b) ), maximization of positive farmland ecosystem service value (from Eqs. 7(a)  to 7(i) ), and minimization of negative farmland ecosystem service value (from Eqs. 8(a)  to 8(g) ). Optimizing these objectives directly contributed to achievement of SDG 2 (food security), SDG 6 (water security), SDG 7 (energy security), SDG 8 (economic growth), and SDG 13 (climate change mitigation), whilst indirectly supported SDG 3 (human well-being), SDG 11 (sustainable cities), SDG 12 (sustainable production), and SDG 15 (sustainable land ecosystem) by providing safe energy, clear water, and nutritious food, and sustainable management. For example, [7.17, 7.64] × 107  kWh, [4.05, 4.23] × 107  kWh, and 1.00 × 107  kWh of hydroelectricity were generated respectively in wet year, normal year, and dry year, contributing to renewable energy strategies and sustainable development. Optimal results under different weights scenarios presented tradeoffs among different objectives (see Fig. 6 ). Socio-economic objective was in conflict with both resource objectives and eco-environmental objectives, while eco-environmental objectives were little sensitive to varying importance orders of objectives. The proposed modeling framework was applied to a real-world case study of the Zhanghe Reservoir irrigation area to identify resource management solutions. Given the current results, we propose specific managerial suggestions from three perspectives, namely economic development, resource utilization, and ecological effects. (1) Economic development: Since the economic efficiency of resource allocation is almost to the ceiling, quickening the establishment of a modern industrial system with higher potential economic benefit is desirable. On the one hand, integrating advanced technology is necessary under the guidance of government administrative regulations and financial support. On the other hand, local managers should adjust industrial layout and give impetus to gradual transition from traditional low-profit industries to strategic emerging industries, such as biotechnology, information network, and high-end manufacturing, on the basis of developing its own advantageous industries. (2) Resource utilization: General reservoirs and ponds, which are operated independently from the Zhanghe Reservoir, have important roles in storing precipitation and supplying irrigation water on-demand. The irrigation system of vine-with-melon type is accordingly highly recommended in rainy region to support flexible and efficient water allocation. The system can be further enhanced by improving internal water storage capacity of “melon” and water delivery efficiency of “vine”. (3) Ecological effects: From the results, every 1 CNY ecosystem service value generation was accompanied by 0.18 CNY negative ecosystem service value. Among which, GHGs emission constituted an overwhelming proportion ([93.24%, 93.60%]) of the total negative value. In order to reducing negative ecological effects, far more endeavors should be done on controlling application of fertilizer, pesticide, electricity, and agricultural machinery, improving tillage method, and carrying out integrated management of irrigation and drainage in paddy field. Besides, developing circular agricultural production would be a promise strategy towards efficient, eco-environmental friendly, and long-term sustainable resource management solutions. The proposed model emphasized on major connections among agricultural EWFN system in ZRIA. For example, crop production highly depended on water, energy, and land resources. Fossil energy consumption was needed for seeding, tillage, and harvest, causing negative impacts for farmland ecosystem. Agricultural inputs controlling for environmental protection would affect crop production. Although hydropower can be generated from water resources, once more gallons of water were allocated to hydropower, less gallons of water were available for agriculture, causing yield reduction of crops. However, the actual EWFN system was far more complex, and many components and processes were ignored in this study. For example, bioenergy produced by crop straw was ignored for the reasons of complex conversion processes and lower importance than hydropower in ZRIA. Interrelations among EWFN system will be enriched in further study to improve the applicability of the model framework. In this study, it was assumed that there was no variation of climatic condition and soil condition, thus the same crop water production function can be used throughout the irrigation area. Besides, several farmland ecosystem service such as biodiversity conservation, species preservation, cultivated land degradation, and soil erosion were ignored because of the difficulty of accurate quantification. Furthermore, some important social elements were not taken into consideration, such as drinking water security, resources development, and employment. Subsequent research would concentrate on the spatial variability of natural resources and field conditions, as well as improvement of accuracy and comprehensiveness of the model framework.   5 Conclusion This study provides a potential optimization-based approach to achieving sustainable development goals in agricultural energy-water-food nexus system. A TIFNs-based interval stochastic multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model is established for sustainable water and land resources management. The main contributions can be drawn as (1) developing novel modelling framework for sustainable management of agricultural energy-water-food nexus; (2) generating sustainable solutions for water and land allocation balancing socio-economic, resource, and eco-environmental objectives; and (3) reflecting complex relationships and multi-fold uncertainties in agricultural irrigation system. The modelling framework was applied in agricultural energy-water-food nexus system in Zhanghe Reservoir irrigation area. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows. (1) The efficiency-equity tradeoff was balanced, with the maximum and minimum social welfare index being 0.99 (when λ  = 1) and 0.94 (when λ  = 0.2), respectively. Increasing system inputs was pivotal to economic prosperity promotion. (2) Heading stage was the critical period for irrigation, which is the most sensitive stage to water shortage. Conjunctive allocation of reservoir water, internal water, and external water during different periods was effective in guaranteeing food security in dry years. (3) Agricultural products supply was the major contributor to positive farmland ecosystem service. Up to [93.24%, 93.60%] of negative farmland ecosystem service value was caused by carbon emission of GHGs, which cannot be neutralized by carbon sequestration of crops. Efficient farmland management was necessary for global warming mitigation, from the aspects of reducing man-made carbon emission and increasing the potential for carbon sequestration. The developed optimization approach and corresponding solving method can be applied to other similar regions and systems towards sustainability. However, there were some potential problems needed to be paid attention to in further studies, such as how to expand nexus approach to a broader scale, how to integrate more interactions among energy-water-food nexus, and how to quantify more ecosystem service functions.
