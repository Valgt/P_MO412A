                  The SDGs are intended to address sustainable development processes in both developed and developing countries, and to facilitate action at all levels and with all actors, including government, civil society, the private sector and the science community. The SDG 14 covers, among other features, economic pressures on the marine environment and takes into account the specificities of coastal communities. This paper reviews the rational for the SDG 14, as well as the framework for the SDG 14 indicators including (i) some basic concepts such as the role of uncertainty, irreversibility and thresholds in the marine context, and the multidimensionality of the indicators; (ii) synergies and trade-offs among the SDG 14 targets, and between SDG 14 and other SDGs targets, and how to track progress on policy coherence at the national level; (iii) synergies between SDG 14 indicators, and Millennium Development Goals’ and Multilateral Environmental Agreements’ targets and indicators; and (iv) the role of big data. Indicators at the global and national scales (France) are also explored. To conclude, there are challenges and opportunities for future research in this area such as the development of indicators building on the frontiers of ocean science, the development of innovative approaches for data collection, the development of common approaches in valuing marine ecosystem services and national accounting, the provision of incentives for best practice and peer-learning, the harmonisation of measurement methodologies and the selection of SDG 14 indicators according to the geographical level of intervention.

The SDG 14 covers, among other features, economic pressures on the marine environment and takes into account the specificities of coastal communities. This paper reviews the rational for the SDG 14, as well as the framework for the SDG 14 indicators including (i) some basic concepts such as the role of uncertainty, irreversibility and thresholds in the marine context, and the multidimensionality of the indicators;  (ii) synergies and trade-offs among the SDG 14 targets, and between SDG 14 and other SDGs targets, and how to track progress on policy coherence at the national level; (iii) synergies between SDG 14 indicators, and Millennium Development Goals’ and Multilateral Environmental Agreements’ targets and indicators; and (iv) the role of big data. Indicators at the global and national scales (France) are also explored. To conclude, there are challenges and opportunities for future research in this area such as the development of indicators building on the frontiers of ocean science, the development of innovative approaches for data collection, the development of common approaches in valuing marine ecosystem services and national accounting, the provision of incentives for best practice and peer-learning, the harmonisation of measurement methodologies and the selection of SDG 14 indicators according to the geographical level of intervention.   JEL-codes Q01  Q20  Q30   Keywords Oceans  Sustainable development goal  Indicators    1 Introduction and methods The SDGs are intended to address sustainable development processes in both developed and developing countries, and to facilitate action at all levels and with all actors, including government, civil society, the private sector and the science community to strengthen the capacity of the State to achieve the desired outcomes. The SDG 14 “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development” covers, among other features, economic pressures on the marine environment, as well as the specificities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and coastal communities. The latter are particularly impacted by the economic pressures and dependent on the oceans in socio-economic terms. In Section 2 , the main results of the paper are described. Firstly, the paper reviews the rationale for the SDG to highlight the importance of monitoring the oceans in a context where key pressures are compromising the ability of the oceans to deliver economic, social and environmental benefits. Secondly, the paper analyses the framework for the SDG 14 indicators as a means to understand the different concepts and processes than should be integrated when developing the indicators. In particular, the paper addresses (i) the conceptual framework of SDG 14 indicators, i.e. the role of uncertainty, irreversibility and thresholds in the marine context, the multidimensionality of the SDG 14 indicators, and how to ensure effective SDG 14 monitoring and implementation through SMART SDG 14 targets; (ii) synergies and trade-offs among the SDG 14 targets and between SDG 14 and other SDGs targets, and how to track progress on policy coherence at the national level; (iii) synergies between SDG 14 indicators, and ocean-related Millennium Development Goals’ (MDGs) 7 and Multilateral Environmental Agreements’ (MEAs) targets and indicators; and (iv) the role of non-traditional sources of data such as big data to have access to more reliable, frequent and cost-effective information. Thirdly, some preliminary indicators for the SDG 14 at the global and national scales (France) are explored. Given these results, some areas for future research in the framework of SDG 14 indicators are proposed in Section 3 . The analysis in this paper is based on an extensive literature review and on exchanges with experts from national governments, international institutions, private and public sector organisations and universities.  2 Results 2.1 The rationale for the SDG 14 2.1.1 The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs indicators On the 25th September 2015, the 193 Member States of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda is the world's first global agreement to provide a comprehensive agenda for action to support transformations towards social, economic and environmental sustainability [108] . Its 17 SDGs and 169 targets will guide the activities of diverse actors over the next 14 years [89] . The SDGs are intended to address sustainable development processes in both developed and developing countries, and to facilitate action at all levels and with all actors, including civil society, the private sector and the science community to strengthen the capacity of the State to achieve the desired outcomes [31] . A comprehensive framework of indicators is needed for implementation of the 2030 Agenda in order to monitor progress, inform policy and ensure accountability of every the stakeholders. The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG indicators (IAEG-SDGs) proposed a global indicator framework that the United Nations General Assembly adopted in March 2016 and revised in March 2017 to track progress at the global level and for collective action towards achieving the 17 SDGs [91,93] . The United Nations Statistical Commission agreed in its 48th session that this global indicator framework would include annual refinements of the indicators, and two in-depth revisions in 2020 and 2025 [110] . Global monitoring should be based, as much as possible, on comparable national data that countries should report to the international statistical system [93] . Member States should also develop more detailed indicators at the regional and national levels to track success at those scales [110] . Depending on local demand and pre-existing reviews, Member States could set revisions at regional and national levels, and report the outcomes of these reviews to the United Nations’ annual High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development [82] .  2.1.2 The policy relevance of the SDG 14 The oceans provide services that are of direct economic relevance for fisheries, aquaculture, offshore oil and gas, shipping, tourism and offshore wind energy [114] . The oceans economy's value stands at US 1.5 trillion dollars in 2010 (or 2.5% of the world gross value added) and should double its contribution by 2030, with the fastest growth in offshore wind energy, marine aquaculture, fish processing and port activities [57] . More broadly, coastal areas within 100 km of the oceans account for 61% of the global gross national product [100] . The oceans play a significant role in social terms as well, accounting for 31 million direct full-time jobs in 2010, mainly in industrial capture fisheries and tourism [57] . Moreover, 350 million jobs are linked to the oceans through fishing, aquaculture, tourism and research [96] . Aggregate income figures do not adequately reflect how the ocean contributes to well-being, particularly at the local level through food security, nutrition and income, as sources of poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities [47] . Regarding human health, 4.3 billion people obtain about 15% of their intake of animal protein through fish consumption and about one billion people depend on fish for their primary source of protein [21,97] . The livelihoods of 10–12% of the world population depend on fisheries and aquaculture; over 90% of capture fisheries’ employees work in small-scale operations in developing countries [23] . These services are particularly relevant for 54 coastal and island countries, the majority of them developing nations, given that the oceans constitute up to two thirds of their total national territory [38] . The oceans are also a critical component of the essential life support systems of the Earth [77,95] . The oceans are the primary regulator of the global climate, cycling about 93% of the total carbon dioxide and absorbing around 30% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions [37] . In addition, the oceans have absorbed about 90% of the warming of the Earth in the last few decades [85] . Healthy marine ecosystems provide services such as water filtration, nutrient cycling, recreational areas and support for biodiversity, which is worth around US 250,000 billion dollars per year [48] . The oceans also provide us with more than half of the oxygen human beings breathe [95] . While ensuring healthy oceans is vital for achieving sustainable development, the impacts of key pressures are compromising the ability of the oceans to deliver economic, social and environmental benefits [95] .1  1 The term ‘healthy oceans’ is a metaphor since the ocean is not an entity to which the concept of health applies. For a recent proposal to give meaning to this metaphor see Nellemann et al. [48] .   These key pressures include over-fishing and over-exploitation of marine resources, pollution, invasive alien species, habitat destruction and climate change [62,97] . For instance, 85% of the world's fisheries are fully exploited, overexploited, depleted or recovering from depletion [24] . Overfishing has resulted in lost benefits to fishing countries of almost US 50 billion dollars per year [118] .2  2 This estimate does not take account of several important factors and is hence a conservative estimate of the potential losses.   The worldwide value of catch from Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing has doubled between 2004 and 2011, resulting in losses of between US 10–23 billion dollars per year [69,95] . Concerning pollution in the oceans, 80% comes from land-based sources [15] . Marine pollution mainly results from direct discharge, land run-off, ship pollution, atmospheric pollution and deep sea mining [62] . Moreover, up to 80% of all litter in our oceans is made of plastic. By 2050, it is estimated that oceans will carry more plastic than fish and that almost every seabird will have ingested plastic [104] . Excess nutrients lead to eutrophication which can lead, in turn to hypoxic dead zones, the latter having increased 10 times between 1969 and 2010 [95] . In addition, marine pollution moves marine species which can impact marine industries and human health [62] . For instance, 7,000 marine species are carried around the world in ballast water every day [120] . It is estimated that 80% of the world's 232 marine ecoregions have invasive alien species [37] . Habitat destruction in the coastline and in the oceans is due, among other factors, to harmful fishing practices, poor agricultural practices, coastal development, forestry sectors, mining, dredging and anchoring, and tourism [62] . Such destruction significantly challenges the survival of plants and animals. Concerning climate change, with the absorption of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic at a rate that is 10 times faster nowadays than in the last 65 million years leading to decreased survival, calcification, growth and abundance of marine organisms [39,49] . The negative effects of climate change also include increased frequency and intensity of weather and climate extremes, ocean warming, sea-level rise, as well as changes in ocean circulation and salinity [97] . By 2100, the impacts of climate change on the oceans including sea level rise, storms, and impacts on fisheries, are estimated to cost in the range of US 600 million to US 2 trillion dollars [49] . Climate change is threatening both the survival and well-being of SIDS and coastal communities in developing countries [11] . For instance, increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events such as hurricanes and floods due to climate change, should further raise the damage already over 20% of the gross domestic product in many SIDS [68] . These states are particularly vulnerable since at least 20% are still categorized as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) [11] . To summarise, the SDG 14 targets cover environmental pressures on marine life due to economic activities. SIDS and coastal communities are particularly impacted by these environmental pressures as well as dependent on marine resources in socio-economic terms ( Table 1 ).   2.2 The framework for the SDG 14 indicators 2.2.1 Conceptual framework: uncertainty, irreversibility and thresholds in the marine context An indicator gets close to or approximates a variable of interest, without being necessarily based on an agreed standard. From a scientific standpoint, indicators are often considered proxies for measurement, which can be used until a measure can be developed. From a regulatory standpoint, an indicator should address a policy question [99] . Most countries have chosen indicators in order to match national sustainable development strategy requirements, regardless underlying conceptual frameworks [98] . Where expressed explicitly, the conceptual framework can rely on the Pressure-State-Response approach developed by the OECD as well as on the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) approach which makes all the components of the Pressure-State-Response model apparent, and which was adopted by the United Nations Development Programme in 1997 and used by European Environmental Agency [98,52] .3  3 The Pressure-State-Response model was initially developed to assess ecosystems. This model and its derived versions are not fully appropriate for monitoring all sustainable development dimensions. The risk assessment framework of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, risk - exposure - vulnerability, would be equally useful in the SDG 14 discussion, with identification of the cluster of countries at risk [101] .   The DPSIR framework is consistent with the ecosystem approach in the marine context and can be applied to the SDG 14 [115,12,14,43] .4  4 The DPSIR can be extended to the DAPSI(W)R(M) approach in which Drivers of basic human needs require Activities which lead to Pressures [18,5] . The Pressures are the mechanisms of State change on the natural system which then leads to Impacts (on human Welfare). Those then require Responses (as Measures).   These frameworks should integrate the multiple activities and the continuum between adjacent ecosystems in the oceans [18] .5  5 Risk assessment and risk management frameworks to account for natural and anthropogenic hazards would complete a unifying framework for integrated marine management. Given the uncertainties and lack of data availability in human-ocean systems and internal ocean interactions, these analytical frameworks should be kept as simple as possible, however [46] .   The complexity of the marine system will probably result on a range of unintended consequences, some of which not apparent until some threshold state has been attained [84] . The SDG 14 indicators should be developed together with the definition of safe minimum standards for interventions into the human-ocean system [113] . The capital-accounting approach is an alternative sustainable development indicator framework to the Pressure-State-Response approach [98] .6  6 A limitation of the Pressure-State-Response approach is that it does not work if there is missing evidence of causal linkages. In addition, there may be multiple pressures for most states, and multiple states arising from pressures, which create difficulties in identifying indicators [71] .   Sustainable development can be measured by analysing whether the productive capacity of the economy is constant or increasing such that the wealth of future generations will is preserved [76] .7  7 There are different degrees of sustainability, ranging from weak sustainability with substitutability between the different capital stocks [76] , to strong sustainability where certain types of capital such as natural capital are non-substitutable, that is, they contribute to welfare in a unique way that cannot be replicated by another capital stock [114] .   Under this approach, it is possible to interpret the SDG 14 indicators within a comprehensive framework that is compatible with macro-economic indicators and the budgeting process. It is also possible to define requirements on possible pathways for increasing economic activities, in the same vein as the safe minimum standards [114] . However, the value of the oceans under this approach is a research topic [114] .  2.2.2 The multidimensionality of the SDG 14 indicators In order to achieve action-oriented SDG 14 indicators, transboundary and terrestrial-marine spatial considerations should be considered [31] . The main spatial scales of intervention for each of the SDG 14 targets determine the most relevant geographical spans for the development of indicators: Subnational, national, transnational, regional or global ( Table 2 ). There are different approaches to integrate these spatial considerations. For instance, the Global Environmental Fund's Global Water Partnership – Mediterranean experience and guidelines for an “Integrative methodological framework for coastal, river basin and aquifer management” brings together the integrated water resources management (including surface water and groundwater management), spatial planning, climate change adaptation and integrated coastal management, instead of preparing them separately [105] . Further into the sea, Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) can also be a means for integrating these spatial considerations [113] .  2.2.3 Effective SDG 14 monitoring and implementation through SMART SDG 14 targets Effective SDG 14 monitoring and implementation requires SMART SDG 14 targets (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant -for all countries-, and Time-bound) [53] . While some of the targets are fairly SMART (e.g. 14.5), others such as targets 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.7 and 14.b are not sufficiently precise. For instance, the IAEG-SDGs could have reformulated target 14.3 to “ensure that the pH level of the uppermost ocean layer does not fall by more than 0.2 units compared to pre-industrial figures” [43] . Moreover, targets 14.3, 14.4 and 14.b should include a timeframe [43] . In addition, it appears that the IAEG-SDGs chose starting points for individual SDG 14 targets as the “here and now”, without accounting for a scientifically verifiable baseline [31] . Most SDG 14 targets are not measurable in quantitative terms, particularly at the global level. According to OECD [53] , among outcome targets, only target 14.5 is quantifiable, while targets 14.1, 14.3 and 14.7 are partly quantifiable. Target 14.2, in particular, involves the measurement of a poorly quantifiable subject. Some targets are not sufficiently ambitious according to scientific understanding. According to ICSU, ISSC [33]  and Loewe and Rippin [43] , for example, the IAEG-SDGs could have reformulated target 14.5 to “conserve at least 20–30% of the area of marine ecosystems through an ecologically representative and effectively managed system of marine protection areas and halt, by 2050, the anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity loss”. Moreover, target 14.5 does not specify the habitats and/or species that require attention, the location and size of the conservation areas, their conservation status and the selection criteria [51] . Targets 14.3 and 14.b would require clarification of the institutional framework that would host such developments [31] .  2.2.4 Links among the SDG 14 targets and between SDG 14 and other SDGs targets Before developing context-specific regional and national indicators, it is important to understand the nature of interdependencies among the SDG 14 targets and between SDG 14 and other SDGs targets, since some targets can reinforce each other, while others may have offsetting effects [108] . Concerning the SDG 14 targets, there are potential trade-offs between targets 14.7 and 14.b that promote economic activities, and targets 14.2, 14.4 and 14.6 that seek to conserve oceans’ ecosystems. Target 14.a on scientific knowledge and technology transfer has the potential to benefit many of the other SDG 14 targets [40] . Targets 14.2 (integrated policy and management) and 14.c (rule of law) have a pivotal role among the SDG 14 targets ( Table 3 ). There are a large number of interdependencies between SDG 14 targets and other SDGs targets. This highlights the need to identify the interdependencies that are most relevant at the different geographical levels (an illustration is provided in bold text in Table 3 ). In terms of these interdependencies between SDG 14 and other SDGs targets, it is possible to broadly identify the links according to the ecosystem services provided by the oceans such as food and energy provision, climate stability, and terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, i.e. SDGs 2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 15 [33] . Some links may involve trade-offs. For instance, there is potential for trade-offs between healthy oceans, i.e. SDG 14, food security, i.e. SDG 2 and economic growth and job creation, i.e. SDG 8 [53] . The links from economic activity, i.e. SDGs 8, 9 and 11, to SDG 14 are in the form of pollution, ocean acidification, and pressure on marine resources [40] . Some impacts of climate change such as sea level rise, ocean warming, and changes in ocean circulation and salinity are not included among the SDG 14 targets, but should be incorporated in local discussions [19] . In addition, potential synergies such as those between SDG 14 and SDG 12 on sustainable production and consumption, e.g. through seafood certification systems, may not be exploited if they are not identified [108] . One way to integrate context-specific trade-offs and synergies between SDG 14 and other SDGs, is to add the relevant ocean-related data as part of the other SDGs indicators. The Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (HELCOM) has reported how its indicators can be useful to monitor SDGs 2, 6, 9, 11 and 12 [30] . These complex links between SDG 14 and other SDGs are useful to identify all the relevant stakeholders when exchanging on the local nature of SDGs targets [40] . Besides, they reveal that there should be a stronger collaboration between the scientific and policy communities to appropriately identify the most important local trade-offs [75] .  2.2.5 Tracking progress on policy coherence at the national level The SDG 17 on means of implementation includes the target 17.14 to “enhance policy coherence for sustainable development”. Within the SDG framework, Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (PCSD) is an approach and policy tool to integrate the economic, social and environmental governance dimensions of sustainable development in policy-making [53] . PCSD aims to increase the capacities of governments and stakeholders to identify synergies and trade-offs between multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives, and address domestic policies’ spill-over effects [58] . Even though indicators for tracking PCSD vary from country to country depending on the local objectives and needs, two broad priority areas are food security and illicit financial flows [54,58] . These two topics concern, among other goals, the SDG 14 [55,74] . Concerning food security, the sustainable exploitation of marine resources can contribute to the availability of this type of food supply source. The long-term conservation of marine areas may impose though, temporary restrictions in the short-term. Policy areas to consider in conjunction with the design and implementation of food security policies include fisheries, e.g. IUU fishing and input subsidies (targets 14.4 and 14.6) [59] . Besides, the share of aquaculture in human consumption will reach 56% by 2024, with 96 million tonnes [63,65] . The SDG 14 could take a closer look to new concepts in aquaculture. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture encourages both greater environmental and economic benefits by cultivating organisms such that the uneaten feed, wastes, nutrients and by-products of one species can be used as fertilizer, feed and energy for other species. In terms of illegal financial flows, joint progress on SDG 12 (responsible production and consumption), 14 and 15 (life on land) could be mutually reinforcing. The exploitation of natural resources can be one of the drivers of corruption and a source of illicit funds [109] . Since laundering of illicit flows is an essential enabler for many of these activities, the restriction of these flows should be given priority [53] .8  8 When fisheries are made illegal by specific treaties that may be seen as highly unfair by local communities.   This topic is associated with the SDG target 16.4 whereby countries should “by 2030 significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows, strengthen recovery and return of stolen assets, and combat all forms of organized crime”.  2.2.6 Ocean-related MDGs 7 targets and indicators These SDGs built and expand on the MDGs, a global-goal setting process with a series of time-bound and quantified targets for the period 2000–2015 [86] . MDGs sought to act as a policy lever to direct development cooperation on poverty related issues [31] . The emphasis of the MDGs was on the human dimensions of poverty such as hunger, education, child mortality and maternal health. These goals included MDG 7 on ensuring environmental sustainability contain ocean-related elements, including three indicators, i.e. the proportion of fish stocks within safe biological limits (MDG indicator 7.4), the proportion of terrestrial and marine areas protected (MDG indicator 7.6) and the proportion of species threatened with extinction (MDG indicator 7.7).9  9 These indicators are associated to MDG targets 7. A (integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes and reverse the loss of environmental resources) and 7. B (reduce biodiversity loss, achieving, by 2010, a significant reduction in the rate of loss).   While the MDGs mobilised action on critical development issues, it is currently acknowledged that addressing poverty requires a much broader focus [87] . Among other factors, the MDGs failed to integrate the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development as envisaged in the Millennium Declaration [86] . As a result, environment and development were not sufficiently addressed together, practitioners often devoting separate efforts to interlinked problems [87] . Nonetheless, the ocean-related targets and indicators in MDG 7 reflect the need to protect and preserve the natural resource base for sustainable development [31] . These ocean-related indicators are used to monitor SDG 14 targets within a broader framework that encompasses the different dimensions of sustainable development.  2.2.7 Synergies between MEAs and SDG 14 indicators The SDGs that directly address the natural environments, namely, the SDG 14 but also the SDG 13 on climate action and the SDG 15 on life on land, should be closely connected to international regimes such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Such linkages are to be made politically in the coming years. Concerning the SDG 14, there are already synergies between the SDG 14 targets and key MEAs such as the CBD and its’ 20 Aichi targets as well as the Ramsar Convention on wetlands ( Table 4 ). Exploiting these synergies can be cost effective [78] . For example, it is possible to draw synergies between SDG 14 and the CBD Aichi targets at the level of indicators. Aichi target 4 is associated with SDG target 14.4, Aichi target 6 with SDG targets 14.4, 14.6 and 14.b, Aichi target 8 with SDG target 14.1, Aichi target 10 with SDG target 14.3 and Aichi target 11 with SDG target 14.5 [30,8,78] .  2.2.8 Big data and SDG 14 indicators Big data is particularly relevant for SDG 14, particularly regarding marine pollution, ocean acidification, marine protected areas and threats to biodiversity due to IUU fishing.10  10 Although there is no fixed definition for big data, this data is characterised by the volume from various sources needing large storage, the speed at which it is generated, the variety of unstructured formats needing additional processing, and the value or meaning not being immediately apparent [106,44] .   In the context of the SDG 14, earth observation (remote sensing, in-situ monitoring) is relevant for targets 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.6, 14.7 and 14.a, and can produce direct measures that can be relevant for the indicators 14.3, 14.5, 14.6 [26] . Salinity, sea-surface temperature and additional auxiliary satellite data enable to work out the pH of seawater and provide accurate information on ocean acidification (target 14.3). Other indicators that can be useful for SDG 14 are the coverage of MPAs and their overlay with key biodiversity areas (target 14.5), the not yet available global mangrove watch (target 14.5) and the Red List Index [2,26] . The Marine Park Authority in Australia uses remotely-sensed water quality information of total suspended sediments and chlorophyll-a for compliance monitoring against guideline values in the Great Barrier Reef (target 14.1) [27] . Initiatives such as Google's Global Fishing Watch and Pew Charitable Trusts’ Project Eyes on the Seas are using real-time data from vessel transponders and satellite imagery to spot illegal fishing and enable law enforcement (targets 14.4 and 14.5). Using Google's earth images, local and regional data on catch volumes, and data about types of fish caught, it is possible to find mismatches between officially reported catch data and estimates including fish catches using weirs [1]  (target 14.4).   2.3 Some preliminary indicators for the SDG 14 at the global and national scales 2.3.1 Global indicators11  11 Building on the United Nations global indicator framework, regional indicators should better reflect regional challenges. For an illustration of regional available indicators, see OECD [64] . Such analysis will evolve as additional indicators are produced [102,28,30,45] .   The SDG 14 targets have been selected according to their policy relevance independently of the availability of indicators. In turn, most indicators do not exist and there is a need to propose and build at least one relevant indicator for each target to enable monitoring. For this goal therefore, eight out of 10 indicators are currently not available compared to 58% for all SDGs indicators ( Table 5 ). The indicators should in fact meet the following criteria: (i) relevant; (ii) methodologically sound; (iii) measurable; (iv) easy to communicate and access; (v) limited in number; and (vi) outcome focused at the global level [90] . At the global level, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian agency for four (14.4.1, 14.6.1, 14.7.1, 14.b), of the 10 SDG 14 indicators [25] . The IAEG-SDGs has classified the global indicators into three categories based on the soundness of methodology and the availability of data [112] . While the SDG 14 was the only goal with no publicly available data by mid-2016, the United Nations Statistics Division currently provides open access to the two SDG 14 available indicators, namely 14.4.1 (proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels) and 14.5.1 (coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas) [16] . Without publicly accessible data, citizens and external groups cannot keep United Nation Member States accountable for their progress in implementing the SDG 14 [60] . The indicator for the target 14.4 is the “proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels” [22] .12  12 Target 14.4 can be also quantified through the maximum sustainable yield weighted by the catch in a given country. Whenever available, this indicator is usually preferred to the safe biological limits statistic since under the latter fish stock renewal is not warranted [17,46] . The maximum economic yield is a more conservative measure than the maximum sustainable yield, and is used in countries such as United States, Australia and South Africa [46] . Besides, there is a close relationship between targets 14.2 and 14.4 since there is a need to have an ecosystem approach to fisheries to integrate exploitation and conservation [119] . The technical interactions, e.g. bycatch in mixed species fisheries, and the biological interactions, e.g. predator-prey relationships, should be ideally integrated when providing advice on fisheries stock [13,70] .   It is a global indicator, covering about 57% of the global catch. There is currently no data available at country level because (i) fish migrates across areas beyond national jurisdictions; (ii) there can be political sensitivities; and (iii) it is data intensive and technically demanding as it needs stock assessment [112,32] . Beyond the SDG framework, there are several targets for this indicator. For instance, the World Summit on Sustainable Development proposed reaching 100% by 2015 and the CBD (Aichi Target 6) implicitly proposes attaining 100% by 2020 [32] . These targets are proposed in a context where global reported commercial catches have risen over time and are about 80 million tons annually, with large amounts of artisanal and IUU fishing catches unreported [94] . Despite these challenges, developed countries consider that this target 14.4 is the most clearly applicable and implementable among SDG 14 targets [66] . The indicator for the target 14.5 is the “coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas”. This indicator could be complemented with an additional indicator that aims to recognise the variation of biodiversity importance (benefits) over space (see, e.g. [6] ). This would help to inform the siting of MPAs to ensure that adequate attention is given to areas that have highest biodiversity benefits and are under most threat [62] . In addition, a complementary indicator could also measure the effectiveness of protected areas in achieving their objectives, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors [46,62] . Management effectiveness is one of the most important problems of MPAs due to insufficient resources, multiple jurisdictions, conflict between different activities and users, and lack of awareness [107] . In 2017, protected areas cover 13.2% of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore), 0.25% of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction and 5.3% of the total global ocean area.  2.3.2 National indicators: France This section reports on SDG 14 indicators in France since this country has made some progressed on this topic. The selection of national SDG 14 indicators is based on the available global and regional indicators complemented when necessary by national indicators relevant for national policies or for national stakeholders. According to the French National Statistical Office, the SDG national indicators should be (i) political relevant; (ii) of high statistical quality according to the Code of Practice; (ii) easy to communicate; (iii) already available or available in medium-term; and (iv) limited in number (around 100 in total to facilitate the communication), but contribute to a well-balanced dashboard on the different themes [72] . The French National Statistical Office shared in March 2017 a first data base of 110 SDGs indicators. The full set of the SDG 14 indicators fall under the responsibility of the French Ministry of Ecology, Energy and Sea [9] . In contrast, the indicators for each of the other SDGs fall under the jurisdiction of several authorities. Concerning the SDG 14, there are a number of scoreboards for tracking public policies on sustainable development in France. These scoreboards can provide indicators which can be integrated with, or complementary to, SDG 14 indicators since they reflect the implementation of sustainable development in the oceans in France ( Table 6 ). The SDG 14 national indicators can be classified as “statistical indicators” (corresponding to the global indicators 14.1.1-14.5.1, 14.7.1 and 14.a.1) or “public policy assessments” (corresponding to the global indicators 14.6.1, 14.b.1 and 14.c.1) ( Table 7 ). To enable public policy assessments, evaluation matrices should be completed and the resulting information should be aggregated. Statistical indicators can be further classified as “available” (corresponding to the global indicators 14.4.1 and 14.5.1), “proxy” (corresponding to the global indicator 14.2.1), or “non-available” (corresponding to the global indicators 14.1.1, 14.3.1, 14.7.1 and 14.a.1). The available indicators are identical to the SDG 14 global indicators requested by the IAEG-SDGs. The proxy indicators are close to the SDG 14 global indicators, while being more adapted to the French context. Resources have to be invested to produce the SDG 14 indicators that are not available at the national level. International institutions can provide statistical support for the estimation of certain of these indicators. In 2010, France already subscribed to an objective of zero subsidies harmful to sustainable fishing (Aichi target 3). France carried out an evaluation of harmful fishing subsidies for the year 2008 [80] . According to this evaluation, there are seven types of harmful subsidies at a total cost of 253.4 million euros; 55% of public aid to professional fishing is harmful to biodiversity. The achievement of a zero subsidy harmful to biodiversity in the fisheries sector by 2020 poses a real challenge [29] . The French SDG 14 indicators in Table 7  should evolve over time [36] . In particular, the SDG 14 national indicators corresponding to the global indicator 14.2.1 should include proxy data on the effectiveness of MPAs in terms of the management and the ecological status. The SDG 14 national indicator corresponding to the global indicator 14.4.1 should include proxy data on the maximum sustainable yield [46] . In addition, SDG 14 indicators could account for sub-national specificities ( Table 8 ). The IAEG-SDGs have raised the need for disaggregated data at global and national levels according to age, gender, migration status, income level, ethnical group, handicap and other features. Such a level of disaggregation has to be integrated into the data collection, which requires additional investments. In France, the processing of personal data including information on ethnical or racial origins is prohibited [35] . If United Nations organisations estimated such data directly, this could raise issues about data quality [9] .    3 Conclusion 3.1 Future research areas in the framework of SDG 14 indicators 3.1.1 Building on the frontiers of ocean science to develop the most appropriate SDG 14 indicators All of the SDG 14 targets have a strong science dimension. The ability to monitor human impacts on the oceans is limited but growing [3] . There are knowledge and data gaps concerning pollution, including the life cycle of marine debris, plastics and micro-plastics, heavy metals and other hazardous substances [107] . Air pollutants, for instance, can accumulate in the food chain through the contamination of water [101] . While scientists have analysed quite thoroughly how air pollution impacts human health and the terrestrial biosphere, the impact of air pollution on the oceans is less well understood [83] . Furthermore, knowledge of many aspects of ocean acidification is very limited [94] . There is limited scientific understanding of the effectiveness of conservation measures, including the associated socio-economic benefits and the role of ocean and land-based activities [107] . Many aspects of integrated coastal management still present important knowledge gaps. Moreover, there is lack of consensus on the definition ecosystem-based management [4] . Additional research to consider, within such framework, cumulative impacts, the precautionary approach and explicitly acknowledged trade-offs, can contribute to a successful application in the management of marine activities. Whatever the target, baselines should be established and further research on safe minimum standards and critical versus non critical indicators would be timely. The heterogeneity in starting positions across both goals and targets in OECD countries suggests that national priorities for implementing the SDG agenda should be set at target level [61] .  3.1.2 The development of innovative approaches for SDG 14 data collection Data should be more reliable, frequent, cost-effective and disaggregated enabling more effective, targeted and innovative public policies [56,82] . Numerous developing countries’ statistical offices were unable to collect, analyse and disseminate data for reporting on the 48 MDGs indicators [43] . Since the number of SDGs indicators is much higher at 244, there is a risk of focusing on less critical or easier to achieve targets [76] . Accountability discussions on SDGs should call for the need to support a data revolution. Earth observations, for instance, are relevant for SDG 14.1, 14.3 and 14.5 indicators. Technologies like blockchain, which facilitates secure online transactions, show promise for tracing fish from the boat to the supermarket (target 14.4). Initiatives like Google's Global Fishing Watch and Pew Charitable Trusts’ Project Eyes on the Seas are using real-time data from vessel transponders and satellite imagery to spot illegal fishing and enable law enforcement (targets 14.4 and 14.5). Drones offer timely data on ocean conditions and fish stocks at a small fraction of existing costs. Such non-traditional sources of data, especially big data, have been underutilized in producing official statistics [44] .  3.1.3 The development of common approaches in valuing marine ecosystem services and national accounting to implement SDG 14, in synergy with other goals The concept of ecosystem services can support the implementation of the SDG 14 in synergy with other goals [50] . It can serve as an organising principle to consider multi-scale and cross-sectoral synergies and trade-offs (van der Belt et al.,  2016). The normative goal underpinning ecosystem services is to ensure both long-term sustainability and the enhancement of human well-being in the short-run within the carrying capacity of the biophysical system [92] . This relationship between environmental change and human welfare should be further scrutinised through the lens of equity such that goods and services are fairly divided among all stakeholders [42] . The poor quantification of the value of marine ecosystems restricts the capacity of SIDS and coastal communities to be financially rewarded for their efforts towards ecosystems’ sustainable management and conservation [79] . Inter-generational equity is relevant for target 14.4; the equitable management of MPAs is relevant for target 14.5 [116,7] . Besides, the services provided by coastal and marine ecosystems should be linked to a number of SDGs, e.g. SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good wealth and well-being) and SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) [117] . The use of common approaches, methodologies and conceptualizations vis-à-vis ecosystem services and their integration in national accounts should be fostered.  3.1.4 The provision of incentives for best practice and peer-learning on SDG 14 indicators The SDGs indicators should inform a review process that takes stock of progress, and provides incentives for best practice and peer learning [82] . There should be a multi-layered accountability framework between actors (the United Nations system, governments, the private sector and civil society), between levels of governance (international, regional, national and sub-national), and between the 2030 Agenda and third parties, including thematic fora (for the SDG 14, for instance, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Trade Organization, the OECD, and the Regional Sea Conventions) [43,88] . Regional and thematic reviews can take the form of peer review mechanisms among countries with common characteristics such as the OECD Environmental Performance Review and the African Peer Review Mechanism [20,67] . Countries should not choose indicators to reflect better outcomes in the reviews since this may impair global efforts to develop best practices [41] .  3.1.5 The harmonisation of measurement methodologies The provision of incentives for best practice and peer-learning on SDG 14 indicators is particularly relevant when considering the harmonisation of measurement methodologies. A lack of international harmonisation of measurement methodologies can have implications both in terms of interpretation and comparability of the data. Marine ecosystem-based indicators in Regional Seas entities are disparate regarding the levels of specificity, the rationales for indicator selection, the degree of sophistication and the use of qualitative information [101] . Different methodologies have been used by Regional Seas entities, for instance, to develop indicators for target 14.1 on marine pollution (chlorophyll-a and beach litter), and target 14.2 (integrated coastal zone management). Inter-calibration shall be, at least, necessary for inter-regional comparison [45] .  3.1.6 The selection of SDG 14 indicators according to the geographical level of intervention Given that few global indicators are currently available, existing regional and national indicators are key for the implementation of the SDG targets. In addition, disaggregated indicator data should allow drawing causal inferences, particularly concerning links within SDG 14 targets, and between SDG 14 targets and other SDGs targets [81] . There is a need to match the main geographical levels of intervention with the scale of the indicator, national and subnational scales being particularly relevant.   3.2 Next deadlines to implement the SDG 14 through indicators from a policy perspective The trade-offs within the overall SDG process are often related to time-scales. On the one hand, there are pressing social needs related to poverty alleviation, food security, job creation and the development of economic activities and, on the other hand, there is a need to ensure healthy oceans to achieve sustainable development in the long-run. In this context, indicators play a key role to highlight the oceans environmental status. The 2017 United Nations Ocean Conference aimed to reverse the decline in the health of oceans through the implementation of the SDG 14. The conference succeeded in reflecting a major change in awareness and public engagement to reverse the deterioration of oceans. It brought together more than 4000 participants from governments, intergovernmental organisations, non-governmental organisations, academia, the scientific community and the private sector. Over 1400 voluntary commitments to support the SDG 14 were made by the different stakeholders. A second conference will be held in Lisbon in May 2020. This is a first deadline to monitor the progress on the four SDG 14 targets, namely, 14.2, 14.4, 14.5 and 14.6, that should be attained by 2020. Besides, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO coordinates the preparatory process of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030) which seeks to transform and bolster the SDG 14 commitments and will require indicators to monitor progress.    Acknowledgements This paper builds over the issue note that was prepared for the 2017 OECD GGSD Forum on Greening the Ocean Economy to steer discussions during the conference, in particular around the theme of Parallel Session A: “Monitoring progress of the SDG 14 implementation”.
