                  More and more Chinese investors are investing in mutual funds linked to a specific United Nations sustainable development goal (UN-SDG) supporting themes such as good health and wellbeing (healthcare mutual funds), affordable and clean energy (renewable energy mutual funds), innovation (technology mutual funds), responsible consumption and production (ethical mutual funds), or life on land (natural resources mutual funds) with the aim to increase their wealth. Therefore, it is important to analyse the financial performance of SDG-themed mutual funds in China. This study is the first in examining whether Chinese mutual funds investing in a specific sector related to the UN-SDGs can beat the domestic-market index diversified across industries. High financial performance would attract more investors and allow firms to capture private financial resources to develop innovative projects that contribute to achieving the SDGs. To this end, this study analyses a sample of 111 Chinese SDG-themed equity mutual funds over the 2009-2019 period, applying several financial performance measures from Jensen's model, Fama and French's model, and Carhart's model. Furthermore, it compares the financial performance of different categories by implementing Student's t-parametric tests for the independent samples and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric tests for the independent samples. The results indicate that the Carhart's model is superior in explaining mutual fund financial performance than the other two models. In general, SDG-themed mutual funds achieve a similar financial performance to that of the market benchmarks; and these results are robust to several asset pricing models. The results also show that the energy mutual funds significantly underperform the biotechnology, healthcare, agribusiness, technology, and ethical mutual funds in China. Contrastingly, the healthcare mutual funds are shown to outperform the energy, technology, and ethical mutual funds, while other categories exhibit similar financial performances. Furthermore, we find that SDG-themed mutual funds investing in the China geographical market perform like those investing in the global and the United States geographical markets. In conclusion, most SDG-themed mutual funds achieve risk-adjusted returns that are not significantly different from the market benchmarks. Therefore, those who invest in SDG-themed mutual funds could achieve good long-term financial performance while satisfying their non-financial preferences.

Therefore, it is important to analyse the financial performance of SDG-themed mutual funds in China. This study is the first in examining whether Chinese mutual funds investing in a specific sector related to the UN-SDGs can beat the domestic-market index diversified across industries. High financial performance would attract more investors and allow firms to capture private financial resources to develop innovative projects that contribute to achieving the SDGs. To this end, this study analyses a sample of 111 Chinese SDG-themed equity mutual funds over the 2009-2019 period, applying several financial performance measures from Jensen's model, Fama and French's model, and Carhart's model. Furthermore, it compares the financial performance of different categories by implementing Student's t-parametric tests for the independent samples and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric tests for the independent samples. The results indicate that the Carhart's model is superior in explaining mutual fund financial performance than the other two models. In general, SDG-themed mutual funds achieve a similar financial performance to that of the market benchmarks; and these results are robust to several asset pricing models. The results also show that the energy mutual funds significantly underperform the biotechnology, healthcare, agribusiness, technology, and ethical mutual funds in China. Contrastingly, the healthcare mutual funds are shown to outperform the energy, technology, and ethical mutual funds, while other categories exhibit similar financial performances. Furthermore, we find that SDG-themed mutual funds investing in the China geographical market perform like those investing in the global and the United States geographical markets. In conclusion, most SDG-themed mutual funds achieve risk-adjusted returns that are not significantly different from the market benchmarks. Therefore, those who invest in SDG-themed mutual funds could achieve good long-term financial performance while satisfying their non-financial preferences.   Keywords Chinese mutual funds  United Nations sustainable development goals  Financial performance  Industry concentration  Country concentration    1 Introduction Poverty reduction, ecological civilisation construction, global climate improvement, and sustainability governance are key issues that must be addressed to achieve sustainable development in China. To advance in these key areas, China has adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that includes a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs) focused on improving health and education, achieving equality, promoting economic growth, efficiently using natural resources, and preventing global warming, as indicated in Table 1   (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2019 ). By committing to these SDGs and taking advantage of the fast growth of Chinese economy, the Chinese government has formulated a National Plan of Science, Technology, and Innovation; created a National Program of Action of Science and Technology for Poverty Reduction; established Innovation Demonstration Zones; and built a Bank of Green Technologies. The implementation of these programs has helped to move 700 million people out of poverty; provide better social protection; reduce mortality rates; narrow gaps between regions; and promote low-carbon industries and citizen initiatives focused on improving the quality of air, water, and forests. However, public financing is not sufficient to advance towards sustainable development in China, and more financial resources from the private sector and civil society are required to complement the efforts of the Chinese government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 2019 ). In this context, mutual funds could play an important role in transforming savings from investors into financial capital that Chinese firms need for their large projects related to good health and wellbeing; affordable and clean energy; industry, innovation, and infrastructure; responsible consumption and production; and life-on-land issues. Thus, mutual funds as shareholders can attend meetings with the board of directors, exercise voting rights, submit shareholder agreements and foster joint institutional-investor engagement to pressure firms in which they invest into implementing business strategies aligned with sustainable-development goals. This would satisfy non-financial preferences of mutual fund investors (Boubaker et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, mutual-fund managers must also comply with their fiduciary duty of increasing investors’ wealth. Therefore, the important role of SDG mutual funds as financial intermediary depends on managers’ abilities to increase investor wealth. Nevertheless, finance literature examining the financial performance of Chinese mutual funds specialising in a specific United Nations SDG (SDG funds) is scarce, most likely because such funds are incipient in China. The only study to explicitly examine the financial performance of Chinese green funds is that of Jin and Han (2018) . They analysed a sample of 96 green mutual funds with concentrated portfolios in the manufacturing industry over the 2010-period, implementing Carhart's four-factor model (Carhart, 1997 ). Their results show that green mutual funds significantly underperform the conventional market benchmarks, indicating that the investment in green funds have a cost for investors. More studies have assessed the financial performance of Chinese conventional mutual funds and found, in general, no strong evidence of statistically significant risk-adjusted returns (Gao et al., 2020; Kiymaz, 2015; Koutmos et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2003; Yang and Liu, 2017 , among others). However, Xiao and Yang (2005) , Chen and Chen (2017) , and Sha and Gao (2019)  found that Chinese mutual funds significantly outperform the market benchmarks as summarized in Table 2  . These contradictory results could be due to differences in the asset allocation of conventional funds included in the samples used and/or the periods analysed. Furthermore, most previous studies adopted factor models to measure fund financial performance, mainly the four-factor model proposed by Carhart (1997) . On the other hand, previous literature focusing on the financial performance of Chinese mutual funds has given relatively limited attention to the effect of the sector in which the funds invest. However, China's economic boom, coupled with the adopted sustainable development initiatives, may have generated different investment opportunities across sectors related to the United Nations SDGs (UN-SDGs). Specifically, China has robust potential for economic growth compared to other emerging markets such as Brazil, as indicated by Li and Lin (2011) . According to the World Bank, its mean annual nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in Chinese currency was 7.85% for the 2009-2019 period, outpacing the United States, Japan and Brazil whose mean GDP growth rates in local currency were 1.84%, 0.67% and 1.25%, respectively, in the same period1  1 Available in https://data.worldbank.org/indicator . Accessed January 26, 2021  . With this growth rate, China became the second largest economy in the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) during 2009-2019 period, achieving, on average, 17.03 trillion U.S. Dollars compared to a mean value of 17.63 trillion U.S. Dollars for the United States, 4.92 trillion U.S. Dollars for Japan and 3.00 trillion U.S. Dollars for Brazil. This is probably due to the Chinese government making provisions for flexible market prices, and allowing autonomy for businesses and foreign and domestic trade and investment during the analysed period, favouring an increase in the number of firms listed in Chinese domestic markets from the 1,718 listed in 2009 to 3,777 in 2019. This has broadened the investment opportunities for Chinese mutual funds, which are of recent creation, with the first being launched in 1998 while the first modern mutual fund was launched in the United States in 1924. By the end of 2020, China had domiciled 7,682 mutual funds that accumulated 18.31 trillion yuan managed by 131 management companies. Mutual funds focused on a specific SDG, whose managers are able to detect these investment opportunities, will comply with their fiduciary duty of increasing investors’ wealth. Simultaneously, these Chinese mutual funds satisfy investors’ thematic investment profiles by investing the accumulated assets in firms related to renewable energy, healthcare, agribusiness, information technology, or natural resources sectors. This will attract fund inflows that will be invested in firms belonging to the SDG-related sectors, contributing to sustainable development. Thus, it is important to know whether mutual funds related to the Chinese SDGs can achieve high financial performance. For this reason, the main aim of this study is to examine the financial performance of Chinese mutual funds that are focused on a specific sector related to the SDGs to answer two important questions: Are Chinese SDG-themed mutual funds able to beat the market benchmark? Which SDG-themed mutual fund categories achieve the highest financial performance in China? Do SDG-themed mutual funds investing in the Chinese geographical market outperform SDG-themed mutual funds investing in the global markets or the United States market? We expect that Chinese SDG-themed mutual funds will outperform the market benchmarks, because the growing demand of products related to the SDGs allows firms to improve their financial performance, generating investment opportunities for SDG-themed mutual funds. However, we expect differences in mutual fund performance depending on the sector and geographical market in which the Chinese mutual funds invest. Stakeholder pressures and sustainable development policies adopted by governments differ across sectors (Martí-Ballester, 2020a ). For example, the Chinese government has signed the Paris Agreement that promotes the use of renewable energy technologies. This may favour firms’ growing opportunities in the renewable energy sector while reducing long-term investment opportunities in other sectors related to fossil fuel resources, which affects the financial performance of funds specialised in the renewable energy sector and the conventional energy sector. Furthermore, SDG-themed mutual funds investing in the Chinese market could benefit from the country's economic boom and outperform other SDG-themed funds investing in firms in the global, European, or United States (US) markets whose economic growth is relatively moderate. This study contributes to extending the empirical evidence in the analysis of the financial performance of SDG-themed mutual funds in different ways. First, China is the largest source of research in SDG-related practices adopted by firms. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses the financial performance of mutual funds that are focused on a specific sector related to the UN-SDGs and that are domiciled in China (Muhmad and Muhamad, 2020 ). Second, the Chinese SDG-themed mutual funds in our sample invest mainly in domestic markets, which would allow them to benefit from investment opportunities generated in the Chinese emerging market, while other studies examine SDG-themed mutual funds domiciled in other regions, such as Europe or North America, that invest mainly in the global, European, or North American geographical markets whose economic growth is moderate ((Alvarez and Rodríguez, 2015; Ibikunle and Steffen, 2017; Jin and Han, 2018; Martí-Ballester, 2019a; Martí-Ballester, 2019b ) The findings of this study could be of interest to investors, managers, firms, and policy makers. For investors focusing on a specific UN-SDG, the study findings show that investing in SDG-themed mutual funds can satisfy their non-financial needs without sacrificing their wealth. For managers, it indicates that they can offer SDG-themed mutual funds to attract SDG-oriented investors while complying with their fiduciary duty of increasing investors’ wealth and consequently their own salary by means of management fees charged on the assets under management. For Chinese firms, this study shows that firms developing activities linked to the UN-SDGs could receive large amounts of money from mutual funds. This would reduce their cost of capital, thereby improving their corporate financial performance. For policy makers, this study shows that Chinese sustainable policies can be financed with private investments. This study also has international implications given that mutual funds domiciled in Europe or the United States could benefit international diversification by considering Chinese securities or Chinese mutual fund shares in their portfolios.  2 Literature review and development of hypotheses According to the modern portfolio theory, a portfolio specialised in one specific sector may increase its unsystematic risk, which could lessen the mutual fund's financial performance, as shown in Fig. 1   (Markowitz, 1952 ). To reduce this unsystematic risk, managers of mutual funds domiciled in countries with small stock markets diversify their fund portfolios by picking stocks across countries (Solnik, 1995 ). Different authors have studied the effect of international diversification on mutual fund portfolios specialised in a specific sector related to the UN-SDGs. These studies have mainly focused on European and American mutual fund industries that mainly invest in global markets, and they provide contradictory empirical evidence depending on the sector in which the mutual fund invests, as indicated in Table 3  . Focusing on the energy sector, Ibikunle and Steffen (2017)  examined the financial performance of European green energy, black energy (fossil energy and natural resources), and conventional mutual funds investing in the European or global geographical markets over the 1991-2014 period, adopting Carhart's model (1997). Their findings indicate that green energy mutual funds underperform conventional mutual funds. However, the former group achieves a similar financial performance to black mutual funds in the European market at the aggregate level. This finding is supported by Martí-Ballester (2019a)  who studied a sample of European renewable energy, black energy, and conventional mutual funds investing in global geographical markets over the 2007-2018 period. Additionally, Martí-Ballester (2019b) shows that between 37.5 and 51.85 per cent of European renewable energy mutual funds investing in global geographical markets underperform the conventional global market benchmarks while 97.53 per cent of renewable energy mutual funds achieve a similar financial performance to black energy global indexes used as market benchmarks. Extending the sample to renewable energy mutual funds domiciled in the United States, Reboredo et al. (2017)  found that the renewable energy mutual fund category significantly underperforms the conventional mutual fund category in both the American and European markets. These findings are congruent with those achieved by Miralles-Quiros et al. (2020) and Martí-Ballester (2020a)  for renewable energy exchange traded funds and renewable energy pension funds industries, respectively. Alvarez and Rodriguez (2015) and Ibikunle and Martí-Ballester (2020)  studied the financial performance of mutual funds specialised in the water sector. At the individual level, Alvarez and Rodríguez (2015)  examined the financial performance of five global water-related mutual funds domiciled in the United States over the 2007-2012 period, implementing Jensen's model (1968). Their findings show that none of these mutual funds can beat the conventional market benchmarks. These findings are congruent with those achieved by Miralles-Quiros (2020) for exchange traded funds in the United States market. Following this research line, Ibikunle and Martí-Ballester (2020)  extended the sample to 88 global water, 198 global ecology, and 370 global natural resources mutual funds domiciled around the world, over the 2008-2017 period, adopting Carhart's model (1997). This allowed them to analyse how fund financial performance is affected by the different weights of the water industry within the fund portfolios. Their findings indicate that global water-related mutual funds achieve similar financial performance to global conventional mutual funds, while outperforming global ecology and global natural resources mutual funds at the aggregate level. These findings are congruent with those achieved by Naffa and Fain (2020)  for global water exchange-traded funds. Focusing on the good health and wellbeing goal shown in Table 1 , Martí-Ballester (2020b)  studied the financial performance of 34 global biotechnology and 178 global healthcare mutual funds domiciled around the world, over the 2007-2018 period, adopting Carhart's model (1997). Their findings indicate that biotechnology and healthcare mutual funds that invest in worldwide firms similarly perform, both achieving better financial performance than those of conventional mutual funds. Other studies focusing on exchange-traded fund industry reach similar results, stating that the healthcare sector is the most important sector for achieving the SDGs (Miralles-Quiros et al., 2020). Extending the mutual fund categories, Adamo et al. (2014)  compared the financial performances of 64 healthcare, 95 natural resources, 30 alternative energy, and 68 ecology mutual funds belonging to the green fund category over the 1985-2012 period, adopting Sharpe's model (1966) . The results showed that the financial performance of green mutual funds depends on geographical diversification of fund portfolios, especially in the case of mutual funds specialised in a specific industry, which is consistent with the findings of Solnik (1995)  for the European markets. Otero and Reboredo (2018)  analysed the financial performance of mutual funds investing in precious metals. They implemented a five-factor model developed by Fama and French (2015)  on a sample comprising 50 precious metal mutual funds and 697 global conventional mutual funds quoted in USD over the 2005-2015 period. Their findings indicate that precious metal funds outperform conventional mutual funds in the pre-crisis and crisis periods. However, the former group significantly underperforms conventional mutual funds in the post-crisis period. This is congruent with the findings of Tsola (2014, 2020), which indicate that precious metals mutual funds are inefficiently operated. Taking thematic sector funds as a group, Ielasi and Rossolini (2019)  compared the financial performance of thematic mutual funds and sustainable and responsible mutual funds over the 2007-2017 period, adopting the five-factor model developed by Fama and French (2015) . They found that sustainable mutual funds outperform thematic mutual funds. Focusing on the socially responsible investment (SRI) industry—described in Chatzitheodorou et al. (2019) —Leite and Cortez (2014)  analysed the financial performance of 54 internationally oriented SRI equity funds and 145 conventional equity funds, adopting a multi-factor model. Their findings indicate that the differences in the performance of SRI and conventional funds are not statistically significant. Considering the individual dimension of SRI, Silva and Cortez (2016)  examined the financial performance of 95 green mutual funds domiciled in Europe and nine green mutual funds domiciled in the United States, using a multi-factor model. Their findings indicate that the European and United States green mutual funds cannot beat the conventional global market index. Focusing on the United States mutual fund industry, Chang et al. (2012)  studied the financial performance of United States green mutual funds, applying a traditional one-factor model proposed by Jensen (1968) . Their findings are similar to those achieved by Climent and Soriano (2011)  that adopted the four-factor model developed by Carhart (1997) , indicating that United States green mutual funds underperform conventional mutual funds. This financial performance of United States green mutual funds is driven by energy screens (Lesser et al., 2016 ). However, the financial performance of Chinese green mutual funds is led by industrial sectors (Jin and Han, 2018 ). These contradictory findings, depending on the sector in which mutual funds invest, could be due to differences in the maturity level of the economic sectors and/or in stakeholder pressures. For example, supranational organisations and some governments have adopted strong environmental measures and policies after signing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Kyoto agreement, and/or the Paris agreement, among others, encouraging firms to adopt environmentally friendly business strategies. Most firms committed to these environmental agreements and policies have been developing incipient and innovative sustainable energy projects, assuming high operational costs in the short-term horizon and offering high returns in the long-term horizon (Reboredo et al., 2017 ; Martí-Ballester, 2017 ). This negatively affects the short- and medium-term financial performance of renewable energy mutual funds specialised in an incipient economic sector. Additionally, the de-carbonisation of the economy negatively affects the traditional energy sector and therefore the financial performance of black-energy funds (Ibikunle and Steffen, 2017 ; Martí-Ballester, 2019a ). On the other hand, mutual funds specialised in mature sectors such as healthcare could easily find undervalued stocks of firms related to the development of healthcare equipment or the delivery of healthcare services and products to patient care, which would allow mutual funds to achieve high financial performance (Martí-Ballester, 2020b ). While previous literature has analysed the financial performance of SDG-themed mutual funds domiciled mainly in Europe or the United States -most of them investing in global, European or American markets-, the financial performance of SDG-themed mutual funds investing in a large emerging market has received little attention despite China now being the most important economy in the world in terms of purchasing power parity and being on track to also become the most important economy in the world in terms of nominal gross domestic product. Its economy is growing rapidly, encouraged by industrial policies and large-scale liberation initiatives that promote domestic manufacturing, which has caused Chinese stock markets to prosper in the last ten years (Koutmos et al., 2020 ). By the end of 2020, 3,777 firms were listed in Chinese domestic markets. Its wide variety with regard to firm size, growth strategies adopted and products offered could allow mutual funds to achieve a diversified portfolio focused on one specific sector that assumes similar financial risks to the domestic market. Furthermore, the monitor and search costs assumed by SDG-themed mutual funds focused on the Chinese market could be lower -and consequently their long-term financial performance better- than those assumed by SDG-themed mutual funds focused on global, European or United States market since the global investment universe is wider, and the United States and European markets’ growth is moderate. Therefore, Chinese mutual funds will probably benefit less from international diversification than European or American mutual funds (Solnik, 1995 ). On the other hand, rapid industrial development in China is causing severe environmental degradation that governments and investors are trying to resolve by pressuring the firms in which they invest to implement environmental strategies that promote green innovation technologies in alignment with the SDGs. Specifically, the Chinese government has formulated a National Plan of Science, Technology, and Innovation and promoted the Bank of Green Technologies, among other programs, while investors are demanding mutual fund managers offer financial products that are aligned with the SDGs. Besides environmental improvements, Chinese economic development has also allowed governments to reduce poverty and to provide better social protection. This reduces mortality rates, which in turn contributes to the aging of the population, generating important social issues related to the healthcare and biotechnology sectors, which are receiving considerable attention from stakeholders. Chinese stakeholder pressure differs depending on the sector in which mutual funds invest, which is probably due to the Chinese government prioritizing two key areas in the implementation of the SDGs: poverty alleviation and pollution control and treatment. Sectors related to the SDGs could receive more attention than others. Additionally, the economic sectors related to the SDGs are at different stages of development in China, which could influence the long-term financial performance of firms in which mutual funds invest and, consequently, the financial performance of mutual funds as well. We therefore hypothesize the following: H1: Chinese SDG-themed mutual funds achieve different risk-adjusted returns depending on the sector in which the mutual funds invest. H2: Chinese SDG-themed mutual funds investing in Chinese firms outperform those investing in firms located worldwide or in the United States.  3 Research method In this section, we explain the data collection process for the Chinese equity mutual funds investing in sectors related to a specific UN-SDG (Table 1 ) and the market benchmark to adopt the proposed financial performance models. 3.1 Sample The initial sample consisted of 148 Chinese equity mutual funds in one sector related to the UN-SDGs as classified by the EIKON/Refinitiv Lipper Global Classification Scheme databases. For each mutual fund, we collected the monthly total return index and the monthly total net assets (in yuans) from December 2009 to December 2019, and we obtained the asset status (active, liquidated, or merged); the geographical areas in which funds invest; and the fund inception dates at the end of December 2019, from the EIKON/Datastream databases. On this sample, we applied several filters to exclude 34 mutual funds with less than 25 months of total return index data, due to methodological issues, and three ethical mutual funds investing in one specific sector not related to those of the UN-SDGs, as in Martí-Ballester (2020a) . The final sample comprised is composed of 111 Chinese equity mutual funds2  2 Data available on request.   classified as equity sector biotechnology (four funds), equity sector healthcare (38 funds), equity theme agribusiness (one fund), equity sector energy (11 funds), equity theme alternative energy (six funds), equity sector information technology (28 funds), ethical theme (19 funds), equity sector gold and precious metals (one fund), and equity theme natural resources (three funds) labelled primary mutual funds as in Martí-Ballester (2020a) , as shown in Table 4  . According to the Refinitiv Lipper Global Classification Scheme, equity sector biotechnology funds invest more than 50% of their assets in firms that belong to the biotechnology industry; equity sector healthcare funds invest more than 50% of their assets in firms in the industries of healthcare equipment and supplies, healthcare provision and services, healthcare technology, pharmaceuticals, and life sciences tools and services; equity theme agribusiness funds invest in firms that belong to the global food production industry, such as producers, distributors, suppliers, and facilitators; equity sector energy funds invest more than 50% of their assets in firms that belong to the energy equipment and services, and oil, gas, and consumable fuels industries; equity theme alternative energy funds invest in a mix of firms related to cleaner technologies for traditional energy, all types of renewable energy (e.g., wind power, solar, and geothermal), and sustainable energy technologies that reduce global warming; equity sector information technology (IT) funds invest more than 50% of their assets in firms that belong to the industries of IT services, software, communications equipment, technology hardware, storage and peripherals, electronic equipment, instruments and components, and semiconductors and semiconductor equipment; ethical mutual funds invest in firms across sectors adopting socially responsible policies; equity sector gold and precious metals funds invest more than 50% of their assets in firms that belong to gold, precious metals and minerals, and silver industries; equity theme natural resources funds invest their assets in a mix of firms related to the extraction of natural resources such as oil and gas, coal mining, metals and minerals, and forestry products. These SDG-themed mutual funds have long-term investment horizons; therefore, they seek investment opportunities that allow them to reach high long-term financial performance. However, mutual funds in our sample were recently created, and their mean age is 4.56 years, as indicated in Table 4 . We also obtained the monthly total return index of the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) China Index as a market benchmark and the monthly China current deposit rate as a proxy for the risk-free rate from the Datastream database. Moreover, we collected the monthly Asia Pacific ex-Japan style factors (size, book-to-market, and momentum) from Kenneth French's website. For robustness, we used the monthly total return index of the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) China Index as a market benchmark.  3.2 Financial performance models To examine the financial performance of Chinese mutual funds investing in a specific sector related to the UN-SDGs, we employed three measures of financial performance coming from Jensen's model (1968), Fama and French's model (1993), and Carhart's model (1997). These multi-factor models have been commonly used in the assessment of fund financial performance, and their implementation allows us to compare the findings of this study with those achieved by previous authors. Based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Jensen (1968)  compared the excess return of portfolio f over the risk-free rate, with the market's excess return during the time span t, running a regression for each mutual fund, as follows:(1) r f , t   = α 0 , f   + β 0 , f   r m , t   + ε  f , t         In this equation, rf,t  denotes the excess return of the fund portfolio f over the Chinese current deposit rate used as a proxy for the risk-free rate at time t; rm,t  indicates the excess return of the market represented by the MSCI China Index at time t, given that most mutual funds in our sample invest in firms located in China; α0,f  represents the fund's risk-adjusted return. A risk-adjusted return value that is higher than 0 indicates that managers succeed in beating the market; a value below 0 indicates that managers underperform the market; and a value of 0 shows that managers perform similarly to the market during the time span analysed. β0,f  denotes the market factor loading for fund f; and εf,t  is a residual term. We estimated the standard errors using Newey and West's (1987)  approach. Although this single-factor CAPM model has been extensively used to assess the financial performance of mutual funds, it neglects the risk associated with funds’ investment styles that could affect the magnitude of Jensen's alpha when the investment styles differ among mutual fund categories (Martí-Ballester, 2015 ). To lessen this omitted factor bias in the financial performance evaluation, Fama and French (1993)  extended Jensen's model (1968) by introducing the size factor, which captures the small-scale risk exposure and the book-to-market factor, capturing the bankruptcy risk, as follows:(2) r f , t   = α 0 , f   + β 0 , f   r m , t   + β 1 , f   S M B t  + β 2 , f   H M L t  + ε  f , t        In this equation, SMBt  denotes the difference between small-cap portfolio returns and large-cap portfolio returns at moment t; HMLt  represents the difference between value-stock portfolio returns and growth-stock portfolio returns at time t; β1,f , and β2,f  denote the size and book-to-market factor loadings, respectively, for fund f. The other variables are described in Model [1]. We estimated the standard errors using Newey and West's (1987)  approach. Extending the financial performance assessment model proposed by Fama and French (1993) , Carhart (1997)  introduced a momentum factor, as follows:(3) r f , t   = α 0 , f   + β 0 , f   r m , t   + β 1 , f   S M B t  + β 2 , f   H M L t  + β 3 , f   M O M t  + ε  f , t         Here, MOMt  is the difference between top and bottom performing portfolio returns in a previous period at time t; and β3,f  denotes the momentum factor loading for fund f. The other variables are described in Models [1] and [2]. We estimated the standard errors using Newey and West's (1987)  approach. For robustness, we also regressed Model [3] considering the FTSE China Index at time t as a market benchmark. Additionally, we compared the financial performance between categories by means of Student's t-parametric tests for the independent samples, as in Martí-Ballester (2020a) . As a robustness check, we also implemented the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-tests as an alternative to the parametric t-tests.   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Results and discussion for financial performance models by mutual fund categories This study assesses the financial performance of SDG-themed mutual funds by implementing Jensen's model (1968), Fama and French's model (1993), and Carhart's model (1997). Table 5   reports the descriptive statistics of biotechnology, healthcare, agribusiness, energy, alternative energy, technology, ethical, gold and precious metals, and natural resources mutual funds obtained by applying Jensen's model. As observed, while the healthcare mutual funds have a mean risk-adjusted return close to zero, the other mutual fund categories have a negative mean risk-adjusted return. The healthcare mutual fund category has the largest mean risk-adjusted return (0.00%), whereas the natural resources fund category has the lowest mean risk-adjusted return (-9.60%). No fund is able to beat the market benchmark, while 15.32 per cent of the funds in the study sample significantly underperform the market benchmark. However, this percentage varies by mutual fund category. Specifically, 66.67 per cent of the natural resources mutual funds significantly underperform the market benchmark. This percentage is reduced by half for the energy and alternative energy mutual fund categories, achieving 36.36 per cent and 33.33 per cent of mutual funds, respectively—a worse financial performance than the market benchmark. For the ethical mutual fund category, 21.05 per cent of funds underperform the market benchmark, while this percentage falls to 14.29 percent for the technology mutual fund category. Only 2.63 per cent of the healthcare mutual funds deliver a significantly worse financial performance than the market benchmark, and all mutual funds belonging to the biotechnology, agribusiness, and gold and precious metals categories exhibit a similar performance to that of the market benchmark. These results slightly change when Fama and French's model is implemented, which considers size and book-to-market factors, as indicated in Equation [2]. As observed in Table 6  , all mutual fund categories have a negative mean risk-adjusted return, oscillating between -1.30 per cent for the healthcare and agribusiness mutual fund categories and -12.20 for the energy mutual fund category. However, only 13.51 per cent of the mutual funds in our sample significantly underperform the market benchmark; and the remaining mutual funds reach a similar financial performance to that of the market. Examining the financial performance of mutual funds by category, we find that all the biotechnology, agribusiness, gold and precious metals, and natural resources mutual funds perform similarly to the market, while the percentage of mutual funds that significantly underperform the market benchmark decreases until reaching 7.14 per cent for the technology mutual funds and increases until achieving 31.58 per cent for the ethical mutual funds, in relation to the results achieved from Jensen's model. The mean R-squared by category for the three-factor model increases, compared to Jensen's model, confirming that Fama and French's model explains the mutual fund risk-adjusted returns better than Jensen's. Table 7   shows the descriptive statistics obtained from Carhart's model, which incorporate the momentum factor into Fama and French's models, as shown in Equation [3]. The results indicate that all mutual fund categories have a negative mean risk-adjusted return, oscillating between -0.30 per cent for the agribusiness mutual fund category and -14.10 for the energy mutual fund category. However, only 8.11 per cent of the mutual funds in our sample significantly underperform the market benchmark, while the remaining mutual funds exhibit a similar financial performance to that of the market, which means an improvement in financial performance compared to that achieved from Fama and French's model. By mutual fund category, the results indicate that all the biotechnology, agribusiness, gold and precious metals, and natural resources mutual funds perform similarly to the market, while 18.18 per cent of the energy mutual funds, 16.67 per cent of the alternative energy mutual funds, and 15.78 per cent of the ethical mutual funds underperform the market benchmark, which indicates an improvement in the financial performance of these categories, while the other mutual fund categories do not change in relation to the results coming from Fama and French's model. Thus, in general, the Chinese SDG-themed mutual funds perform similarly to the Chinese market index diversified across industries. This is probably because SDG-themed mutual funds invest in firms with long payback periods to reach long-term financial performance and most SDG-themed mutual funds included in our sample were created in a relatively recent period, as shown in Table 4 . This lack of maturity of the Chinese mutual fund industry could explain the differences with the findings achieved by other authors in specific sectors such as healthcare and biotechnology (Martí-Ballester, 2020b ) or ethical mutual funds (Lean et al., 2015 ). Specifically, Martí-Ballester (2020b)  finds that 6.25 percent of biotechnology funds and 12.36 percent of healthcare funds investing in worldwide firms are able to beat the conventional market benchmark. On the contrary, 2.25 percent of healthcare funds underperform the market benchmark, while the remaining biotechnology and healthcare funds perform similarly to it. The global healthcare market allows mutual funds to invest in firms located in countries with different investment incentives, healthcare laws and policies. For example, the United States has mature private healthcare and biotechnology industries characterised by a lack of regulation, which leads to an increase in per capita spending on healthcare. US healthcare firms in which mutual funds invest have been developing innovation projects for years, which makes it easier to find healthcare or biotechnology funds that achieve higher long-term financial performance than their market benchmark. On the contrary, the Chinese healthcare and biotechnology sectors are still growing, the former particularly fast but not enough to meet the demands of the health services. To satisfy this growing demand, the Chinese government has implemented policies and measures for large-scale reform of the medical and health insurance infrastructure, encouraging innovation in healthcare technologies, applying artificial intelligence to healthcare, opening up the healthcare market and permitting private investments in private hospitals and pharmaceutical firms to create an attractive market for long-term investors, such as healthcare and biotechnology funds, most of which are achieving similar medium-term financial performance to the market benchmark. According to Lean et al. (2015) , SRI mutual funds investing in European or North American markets are able to beat the market benchmark. However, 15.79 percent of Chinese ethical mutual funds in this study underperform the market benchmark, while the rest perform similarly. This difference in performance could be because United States and European SRI mutual funds have been adopting socially responsible investment practices as part of their stock selection processes in their portfolios for a while, which has allowed them to achieve high long-term financial performance. However, the implementation of ethical criteria is more recent in China, their mean age being 5.38 years, and these funds need more time to make their investments profitable in the long term. The findings for precious metal funds are contradictory. While this study shows that Chinese precious metal funds perform similarly to the market benchmark, Tsola (2014, 2020) find that they are inefficiently operated and Otero and Reboredo (2018)  find that precious metal funds outperform conventional mutual funds. These contradictory results provide evidence that the financial performance of precious metal funds depends strongly on the economic cycle. Likewise, we find that natural resource funds perform similarly to the market benchmark, while Ibikunle and Martí-Ballester (2020)  note that global natural resource funds underperform the conventional market benchmark. This contradictory finding may be due to China having an abundance of natural resources that are being managed well, contributing to Chinese economic development (Fan et al, 2012 ) and allowing Chinese natural resource funds to achieve similar financial performance to the market benchmark in the medium term. However, at the global level, the relationship between the abundance of natural resources and corruption could deteriorate the financial performance of firms operating in this sector and, consequently, the financial performance of natural resource funds (Bhattacharyya and Hodler, 2010 ) For the renewable energy and energy funds, we achieved similar results to those obtained by Ibikunle and Steffen (2017)  and Martí-Ballester (2019a , 2019b) for the European market. This is probably because the renewable energy sector is incipient worldwide, and mutual funds need more time to materialise high long-term fund financial performance, while the conventional energy sector is undergoing the progress towards decarbonisation of the economy, reducing the investment opportunities for mutual funds. Regarding the risk factors, 88.29 per cent of the coefficients on the market factor are positive, on average, and statistically significant (at the 10% level), while no mutual funds in the sample have significantly negative market-factor coefficients. Only a small number of the mutual funds exhibit significant coefficients on the size, value, and momentum factors, which could indicate that the Chinese SDG-themed mutual funds are very sensitive to domestic market movements and that they invest in firms with different size and growth strategies. This finding is congruent with those achieved by Yi and He (2016)  for conventional mutual funds. The mean R-squared obtained from Carhart's model is superior to Jensen's model and Fama and French's model in explaining financial performance in all mutual fund categories, which is congruent with the findings obtained by Sha and Gao (2019)  for the Chinese conventional mutual fund industry. For robustness, we ran the four-factor model developed by Carhart (1997) , using the FTSE China Index as a market benchmark and reached similar results to those shown in Table 7 , as indicated in Table 8  . Meanwhile, by implementing Student's t-parametric tests, we compared the mean risk-adjusted returns coming from Carhart's model [3] by mutual fund category. As shown in Table 9  , the energy mutual fund category significantly underperforms the biotechnology, healthcare, agribusiness, technology, and ethical mutual fund categories, on average. Additionally, the healthcare mutual fund category significantly outperforms the technology and ethical mutual fund categories, while the remaining mutual fund categories exhibit similar financial performances. Thus, although most SDG-themed mutual funds achieve a risk-adjusted return that is close to zero, the small percentages of the mutual funds significantly underperforming the market benchmark in some categories could lead to significant differences in mean financial performance between the mutual fund categories, which supports our hypothesis H1. This could indicate that the investment opportunities differ among SDG-themed Chinese economic sectors. This is likely due to differences in the activism of stakeholders among sectors and in the maturity level of the economic sectors. This finding is consistent with those achieved by Martí-Ballester (2020a)  for the pension fund industry. For robustness, we adopted the Mann-Whitney U-nonparametric tests to compare the mean risk-adjusted returns coming from the four-factor model developed by Carhart (1997) . The results were similar to those achieved in Student's t-tests, as shown in Table 10  .  4.2 Results and discussion of financial performance models in terms of mutual funds’ geographical scope In this subsection, we assess the financial performance of SDG-themed mutual funds, considering the geographical markets in which they invest. Table 11   summarises the descriptive statistics of the biotechnology, healthcare, energy, technology, and natural resources mutual funds obtained from Carhart's model. The other mutual fund categories specialised only in Chinese stock markets are not included in this table. As observed, SDG-themed mutual funds investing in the United States or global geographical markets have the largest mean risk-adjusted returns compared to those achieved by the biotechnology (-7.20%), healthcare (-2.70%), technology (-8.70%) and natural resources (-10.20%) mutual fund categories focused on the China geographical market. In the energy sector, the mean risk-adjusted return is higher for the mutual funds investing in global geographical markets than that achieved by mutual funds investing in the China geographical market, which, in turn, is higher than that obtained by mutual funds investing in firms located in the United States. However, only 5.95 per cent of mutual funds, mainly investing in the China geographical market, significantly underperform the domestic market benchmark, while the remaining SDG-themed mutual funds in Table 11  exhibit a similar financial performance to that of the domestic market. Adopting Student's t-parametric tests for the independent samples, we compared the mean risk-adjusted returns, applying Carhart's model [3], by geographical markets. The results obtained indicate that the differences between average annualised alpha are not more significant for SDG-themed funds focused on the Chinese market than for those focused on global geographical markets (Student-t test=0.808; p-value=0.421), for SDG-themed funds focused on Chinese markets than those focused on the United States market (Student-t test=0.102; p-value=0.919), and for SDG-themed funds focused on global geographical markets than those focused on the United States market (Student-t test=-0.360; p-value=0.724). Thus, an internationally diversified SDG portfolio domiciled in China carries a similar risk-adjusted return to that of a Chinese SDG portfolio. This finding contradicts those of Solnik (1995)  for the European markets. This could be because China is a large emerging market. It offers more investment opportunities than the European markets for which international diversification is more attractive, as their domestic markets are small. It also offers more investment opportunities than the United States market whose growth is moderate. This finding does not support our hypothesis, H2. However, this should be received with caution, as the results obtained probably do not capture the benefits of the liberalisation of the Chinese capital market, which will materialise in the long-term horizon, while most mutual funds in our sample were recently created, as shown in Table 4  (Koutmos et al., 2020 ). For a robustness check, we adopted the Mann-Whitney U-nonparametric tests to compare fund financial performance, applying the four-factor model developed by Carhart (1997) , by geographical market. The results are congruent with those achieved in the Student's t-tests. Thus, we find that the Chinese SDG-themed funds investing in Chinese markets perform, on average, similarly to Chinese SDG-themed funds investing in the United States market (Mann-Whitney U-test=0.172; p-value=0.991) and to the Chinese SDG-themed funds investing in global geographical markets (Mann-Whitney U-test=0.298; p-value=0.488). We also find that the Chinese SDG-themed funds investing in the United States market and the Chinese SDG-themed funds investing in global geographical markets exhibit similar financial performances (Mann-Whitney U-test=0.210; p-value=0.624).   5 Conclusions The progress towards achieving the UN-SDGs requires financial resources coming from both the public and private sectors. From the private sector, mutual funds could play an important role if they can increase investors’ wealth by investing the accumulated assets in sectors related to the UN-SDGs. For this reason, this study examined the financial performance of 111 Chinese equity mutual funds specialised in one sector related to the UN-SDGs, by sector and market in which the mutual funds invest. We implemented three financial performance models on this sample: Jensen's model, Fama and French's model, and Carhart's model (Jensen, 1968 ; Fama and French, 1993 ; Carhart, 1997 ). We compared the financial performance of the funds by sector and market in which the mutual funds invest, adopting the Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U-test. Our findings indicate that, in general, SDG-themed mutual funds can perform similarly to a Chinese market index diversified across industries in the medium-term horizon; it is expected that they will be able to achieve high long-term financial performance. SDG-themed mutual funds invest in firms that make large initial investments with long payback periods, offsetting their initial investments in the medium-term horizon; it is probable that they will reach high corporate financial performance in the long-term, increasing fund financial performance. Comparing SDG-themed mutual fund categories, we found that the healthcare fund category significantly outperforms the energy, technology, and ethical fund categories; and the energy fund category significantly underperforms the biotechnology, agribusiness, technology, and ethical fund categories. The remaining mutual fund categories exhibit similar financial performances. These differences by fund categories could be due to the fact that economic sectors in which SDG-themed mutual funds invest are in different stages of their life-cycles and/or that stakeholder pressures are different depending on the sector related to the SDG. Renewable energy and traditional energy sectors are facing challenges, regarding the efficient use of energy, from conventional and renewable sources encouraged by governments that promote environmental laws and directives and by civil society that demands environmentally friendly products. These challenges require large investments to develop innovative green technologies that allow sectors to reduce pollution and waste and to improve efficiency. In the initial phase of the sector life-cycle, it is difficult for mutual funds and firms working in renewable energy projects to achieve high financial performance in the short-term, as they seek to offset the investment costs in the medium-term and to reach high financial performance in the long-term. The de-carbonisation of the economy has been detrimental to the fossil-fuel energy sector in the declining stage of its life-cycle. While the use of renewable energy resources is incentivised worldwide, the use of fossil fuel resources and their importance in the global economy is diminishing. This reduces the investment opportunities for the energy mutual funds in the short-, medium-, and long-term. On the other hand, the healthcare sector is receiving support from the Chinese government, and it is easy for mutual funds to find undervalued stocks of firms specialised in the treatment of diseases or in the development of healthcare technology for curing specific diseases, which allows them to achieve better financial performance in the medium term than that achieved by other fund categories. Furthermore, we also found that the Chinese SDG-themed mutual funds investing in Chinese firms perform similarly to those investing in firms located in global geographical markets or in the United States market. Thus, Chinese SDG-themed mutual funds do not benefit from international diversification, probably because their large emerging market allows them to find investment opportunities that are expected to materialise a high fund financial performance in the long-term, whereas the sample used in this study includes mutual funds with a mean age of 4.56 years. Most SDG-themed mutual funds investing in domestic markets can comply with their fiduciary duties. This could increase their assets under management, deriving from investors interested in funding sustainable-development projects implemented by Chinese firms, which would allow SDG-themed mutual funds to increase their shareholdings in portfolio firms. These large shareholders may exert their voting rights on the board to pressure firms in which they invest into implementing business strategies that are aligned with sustainable-development goals. This would contribute to the sustainable development of China's economy. This study has one limitation. While the thematic mutual funds are long-term-oriented financial products, the mean age of mutual funds in the sample for this study is 4.56 years (see Table 4 ); therefore, future research could repeat this study, extending the analysis period.
