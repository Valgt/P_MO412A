These 10 papers published in this special issue, we believe, contribute to deepening our understandings of the role tourism plays in contributing to the SDGs.   Keywords Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Tourism and SDGs  Tourism for SDGs    1 Introduction The study and analysis of sustainable tourism occupies significant attention in the scholarly literature (e.g., Boluk, Cavaliere, & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2017, 2019, 2021 ; Bramwell, Higham, Lane, & Miller, 2017 ; Hall, 2019 ; Wheeller, 1993 ). Broadly, in the field of recreation and leisure studies, critical tourism scholars have foregrounded important questions pertaining to the impacts generated by the sector. Perhaps tourism scholars lead such research because we can no longer ignore the environmental, socio-cultural, and political injustices and implications, wrapped up in our decisions and entitlement to travel. Prior to March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic (Ghebreyesus, 2020 ), the impacts of the climate crisis, various unsustainable approaches, and practices, and overtourism occupied the focus of tourism scholarship. Paying attention to, and recognizing such impacts, led to a series of degrowth responses (See Hall, Lundmar, & Zhang, 2021 ) including an important contribution re-defining tourism, centering community stakeholders, who are often neglected or ignored in tourism planning and decision-making (Higgins-Desbiolles, Carnicelli, Krolikowski, Wijesinghe, & Boluk, 2019 ). Our approach to sustainable tourism attempts to strike a balance between the economic, environmental, and social-cultural benefits, and the costs of tourism development (Buckley, 2012 ; Hall, Gössling, & Scott, 2015 ; Rasoolimanesh & Jaafar, 2017 ). Mutually aiming to improve the quality of life of destination residents, while simultaneously trying to conserve the environment, nature, and heritage for future generations (Edgell Sr, 2016 ; Higgins-Desbiolles, 2006 ). While tourism development may have both positive and negative economic, socio-cultural, environmental, technological, and political impacts on destinations (Higgins-Desbiolles, 2018 ; Rasoolimanesh & Jaafar, 2017 ), recent scholarly research has suggested tourism as a sector, is less sustainable now than ever before (Hall, 2011 ; Rutty, Gössling, Scott, & Hall, 2015 ; Scott, Gössling, Hall, & Peeters, 2016 ; Scott, Hall, & Gössling, 2016 ); and critical tourism scholars continue to remind us of this (e.g., Boluk et al., 2021 ; Boluk, Cavaliere, & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2019 ; Bramwell et al., 2017 ; Hall, 2019 ; Wheeller, 1993 ). The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) resulted from the unmet achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (UN, 2018 ), and thus serve as a global framework to improve well-being. Specifically, the SDGs were created as part of a new sustainable development agenda, to address the world's most pressing problems with respect to ending poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring prosperity for all by the year 2030 (UNWTO, 2015 ). In September 2019, world leaders attending the SDG Summit recognized the imperative to accelerate sustainability work responding to the grand contemporary global issues. This resulted in the Decade of Action,  emphasizing the imperative to accelerate and mobilize sustainability solutions on three levels: global action, local action, and people action (UN, 2020 ). Critically, and carefully considering the SDGs as a framework for actioning sustainability thinking in tourism, presents the backdrop for this current special issue. Accordingly, our aim with this special issue was to call on scholars to prudently reflect on the contribution of tourism and hospitality, in progressing sustainability and the SDGs. Such thinking is crucial given the considerable attention the topic of sustainability has received in contemporary tourism scholarship, the imminent global climate emergency, and the fact we really have not given the SDGs adequate reflection in the literature (see Ali, Rasoolimanesh, & Cobanoglu, 2020 ; Bramwell et al., 2017 ; Boluk, Cavaliere, & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2019 ; 2021 ; Rasoolimanesh, Ramakrishna, Hall, Esfandiar, & Seyfi, 2020 ; Scheyvens & Cheer, 2021  for exceptions). This paucity may hinder our realization of the powerful role tourism may play in progressing sustainability. Our call invited analyses from a critical perspective illuminating challenges, hypocrisies, and limits in employing tourism to address issues of sustainable development. We believe such considerations make a valuable contribution to the limited literature in the area and shines a light on exciting avenues for future research. The goal of our editorial is to reflect on and situate our special issue within the current work being carried out in tourism in relation to the SDGs.  2 Setting the scene: tourism and the SDGs scholarship The United Nations has explicitly recognized the importance of the tourism industry in driving sustainability. Initially, deeming 2017 the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development  and secondly, in highlighting the importance of tourism in playing a pivotal role in aiding three (SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production; SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 14 Life Below Water) (UN, 2018) of the 17 SDGs. However, since the pronouncement of the SDGs in 2015, there has been minimal attention paid to examining how the tourism sector may effectively mobilize the SDGs, in order to enhance sustainability in tourism (e.g., Boluk et al., 2021 ; Boluk, Cavaliere, & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2019 ; Bramwell et al., 2017 ; Hall, 2019 ). Despite the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development resolution only mentioning tourism three times, the SDGs have become focal points for the study of tourism's contribution to sustainable development (Ali et al., 2020 ; Boluk, Cavaliere, & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2019 ; Boluk et al., 2021 , Hall, 2019 ; Rasoolimanesh et al., 2020 ; Scheyvens & Cheer, 2021 ; UNWTO and UNDP, 2017 ). Yet, the functionality of the tourism and hospitality industries to facilitate sustainable development and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs has been criticized by some scholars and practitioners (Boluk, Cavaliere, & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2019 ; Boluk et al., 2021 ; Higgins-Desbiolles, 2018 ; Scheyvens, 2018 ). Although, as Butler (1999)  argued, the ambiguity of what is meant by sustainable tourism has led to sporadic and non-systematic monitoring of the impacts of tourism, and achievement of sustainability. Bramwell et al. (2017)  in their marking of 25 years of the Journal of Sustainable Tourism  (JoST) initially noted a dearth of scholarly activity published in JoST on the SDGs. Thus, the authors noted the insufficient attention paid to many of the SDGs in tourism, and explicitly identified most  of the SDGs were underserviced in their journal. Specifically, the authors recognized SDG 13 Climate Action, SDG 14 Life Below Water, and SDG 15 Life on Land, as the three areas receiving the most attention in the literature (Bramwell et al., 2017 , p.6). This led to their following reflection,[…] when an international world body has identified 17 broad areas to define sustainability, and the journal dedicated to thinking about what tourism can contribute to sustainability does so through its connection predominantly in five or six of these areas, then it should give us pause to reflect upon our contribution as a community of scholars, while also encouraging thought on the value of the development path identified by global bodies (Bramwell et al., 2017 , p.6).   Given the attention paid to thinking about sustainability in tourism, as evidenced in the scholarly literature, we believe taking such pause is incumbent among the tourism scholarly community. Furthermore, it is our intention here to continue to stimulate research activity on tourism and the SDGs, and build on some of the initial work encouraging the use of a critical lens in pursuing the SDG agenda (Boluk et al., 2021 ; Boluk, Cavaliere, & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2019 ), considering technology in tourism and SDGs (Ali et al., 2020 ), and the critical importance of partnerships in tourism (Scheyvens & Cheer, 2021 ) to progress the SDGs. Considering Bramwell et al. (2017)  reflections on the underserviced SDGs, we will reflect on some of the contributions of the three special issues in tourism and the SDGs here. The initial special issue published in the field of tourism on the SDGs in JoST called for scholars to engage in “critical thinking to realize sustainability in tourism systems” (Boluk, Cavaliere, & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2019 ), and started to fill a gap in the literature. For example, two papers responded to SDG 1 No Poverty, for example, Scheyvens and Hughes (2019)  critiqued understandings of tourism's role in directly ending poverty. Aligning with this work was one paper which responded to SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities, where authors reflected on the role of multinational corporations in the implementation of fair, and inclusive practices (Campos, Hall, & Backlund, 2018 ). Two papers responded to SDG 4 Quality Education for instance, Cottrell et al.'s (2019)  contribution provided an analysis on conceptualizations of sustainability from the perspective of undergraduate students in Australia. Moreover, Boluk, Cavaliere, and Duffy (2019)  created a framework for empowering critical tourism citizens which they defined, stemming from their analysis of undergraduate students' reflexivity, across three campuses in North America. SDG 5 Gender Equity was examined by authors in three contributions. For instance, Moreno Alarcón and Cole (2019)  noted the need to consider gender equity in all 17 SDGs, and Khoo-Lattimore, Yang, and Je (2019)  noted the underrepresentation of gender and diversity in UNWTO planned events, raising concerns regarding “gender greenwashing”. The second special issue published in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology  focused on the role of technology in tourism and hospitality to achieve the SDGs (Ali et al., 2020 ). For example, Tham and Sigala (2020)  discussed the role of blockchains and cryptocurrencies in tourism aligned with reduced inequalities (SDG 10), facilitating responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). Moreover, the contribution of the sharing economy to community-based tourism (Ditta-Apichai, Kattiyapornpong, & Gretzel, 2020 ), and gamification to sustainable tourism (Souza, Marques, & Veríssimo, 2020 ) and achieving SDGs were highlighted in this special issue. Furthermore, Neto, da Silva, Ferreira, and Araújo (2020) , used TripAdvisor reviews to illustrate how hotels may reconstruct their brands supporting the SDGs. Importantly, Arcuri, Gai, Ielasi, and Ventisette (2020)  investigated the risk of the application of technologies in tourism and hospitality and its impacts on progressing the SDGs. Lastly, Scheyvens and Cheer's (2021)  special issue in JoST centres the importance of partnerships (SDG 17) in the achievement of the SDGs. In addition to sharpening our understanding of the importance of SDG 17, three contributions leaned into the opportunities of tourism for reduced inequalities reflected in SDG 10. For example, Movono and Hughes (2020)  discussed the importance of Indigenous values and respecting local cultural frameworks in Fiji, considering how partnerships between tourism businesses and the local community may contribute to the SDGs. Dolezal and Novelli (2020)  discuss new understandings of empowerment in community-based tourism in three communities in Bali. Mugo, Visseren-Hamakers, and van der Duim (2020)  examine two partnerships in the Amboseli landscape in Kenya, revealing the role of institutional power, challenging conservation, and development discourses. Furthermore, one contribution contributed to our understanding of the role tourism could play in advancing SDG 2, Zero Hunger. For instance, de Visser-Amundson's (2020)  multi-stakeholder partnership analysis highlights the role of nudging consumers to engage in pro-social choices in the Netherlands. The three preliminary special issues on tourism and the SDGs described here, draw our attention to tourism's role in mobilising several SDGs, outside of the few (SDG 13, 14 and 15) receiving the most attention up to 2017 signalled by Bramwell et al. (2017) . Accordingly, SDG 1 No Poverty, SDG 4 Quality Education, SDG 5 Gender Equity, SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities, and SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals has received increased attention since 2017. Building on this work, Rasoolimanesh et al.'s (2020)  scoping review exploring the relevance of sustainable tourism indicators to the SDGs, offered their research as a way to assist tourism stakeholders to improve their understanding of how tourism indicators may respond to the SDGs, across scales and approaches.  3 Deepening our understandings Building on the previous work on tourism and the SDGs, the aim of this current special issue was to publish a collection of studies and best practices helping us to deepen our understandings of the role of tourism and hospitality in progressing the SDGs. We invited analyses from a critical perspective to illuminate the challenges, hypocrisies, and limits in employing tourism to address issues of sustainable development. At the time of writing the call for papers, it was our position, that a more explicit consideration, and critique of the role played by tourism in achieving sustainable development could offer new and exciting avenues for research. Specifically, allowing us to deepen our understanding of the contexts, conditions, and requirements of managing the tourism and hospitality industries, at a time when sustainable development is contested and difficult. We were taken by the abundance of scholarship carried out in tourism studies in relation to the 17 SDGs. We received 71 abstracts in response to our call for papers. To us, this response recognizes the critical role tourism plays in progressing the goals as scholars are clearly reflecting on, and considering sustainability work in the context of this global framework. Yet, the work being carried out is also a reminder of the importance of being critical of the SDGs, as well as tourism's role in responding to the SDGs (Boluk, Cavaliere, & Higgins-Desbiolles, 2019 ; 2021 ; Hall, 2019 ; Higgins-Desbiolles, 2018 ; Schevyens, 2018). All submitted abstracts were reviewed by the editors, and 23 proposals were invited to submit full manuscripts. Finally, 10 papers were accepted after a few rounds of critical reviews. The 10 papers published in this special issue we believe, contribute to deepening our understandings of the role tourism plays in contributing to the SDGs. Importantly, a scholarly focus on tourism's role in progressing SDG 5 Gender Equity was particularly emphasized in the response to our call. We thought, it was incumbent to highlight the attention paid to SDG 5 specifically because Bramwell et al. (2017)  review noted this SDG as underserviced in JoST. Furthermore, the importance of SDG 5 builds on Boluk, Cavaliere, and Higgins-Desbiolles' (2019)  special issue, as well as their contribution which explicitly recognizes the importance of feminist perspectives in critiquing the SDGs. We were also pleased with the variety of geographic perspectives represented in our special issue which we will signal below. This response is important given Boluk et al.'s, (2019 2021)  call for the SDGs to be analyzed from a diversity of approaches and perspectives. Gender Equality (SDG 5) was centered in Abou-Shouk, Mannaa and Elbaz's analysis, who noted the importance of perceptions as predictors of the level of women's empowerment on tourism development, in three Arab countries including Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Oman. The authors' contribution ranked the UAE first among the study sites for women's empowerment. Elshaer, Moustafa, Sobaih, Shaker and Aliedan's work was similarly motivated to explore SDG 5, supported by the Saudi Vision 2030, given women are still understated in tourism. Their results found women's involvement in tourism mutually mediated psychological, political, and social empowerment, and sustainable tourism development. Kaygalak-Celebi, Ozeren and Aydin's cutting-edge analysis casts a light on neoliberal entertainment via Amsterdam Pride drawing attention to SDG 5 and SDG 12, Responsible Production and Consumption. Specifically, the authors call for SDG 5 to be extended paying attention to sexual minorities not currently considered in the presentation of the 17 SDGs. While SDG 5 is centered, the authors argue sexual orientation and gender identity matters must be considered in achieving and queering the SDGs in tourism. Finally, Freund & Hernandez-Maskivker's empirical research on female leaders in Catalonia, Spain, recognized the underrepresentation of women in tourism leadership positions. Their analysis highlighted the importance of women associations, networks, and access to resources to help accelerate SDG 5. We received analyses responding to the importance of supporting Sustainable Cities and Communities SDG 11. For example, Pasanchay and Schott's Community Based Tourism homestays research in Laos adopted a Sustainable Livelihood Framework and presented opportunities to advance SDG 1 No Poverty and SDG 11. SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth and SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities was explored in Jämtland, Sweden, as Kronenberg and Fuchs cast a light on the importance of institutional initiatives for socio-economic sustainability in tourism. The imperative nature of development strategies is situated in the context of an industry notorious for precarious and low paid positions. Reflecting on SDG 13 Climate Action, Nhep, Schott, and Sahli consider the vulnerable circumstances of the coastal hotel tourism sector in Cambodia. Their analysis of hotel managers' perspectives of the hotel sectors' climate vulnerability, juxtaposed scientific reports due to a variety of dynamics including proactive adaptation measures. Degarege and Lovelock analysis centered SDG 2 Zero Hunger, to understand how tourism may aid food security strategies in two rural tourism destinations in Ethiopia. The authors extended the application of the sustainable livelihood framework to tourism, and food security linkages and offer policy implications. Other contributions to this special issue revealed broader impacts to several, if not all, of the 17 SDGs. For example, Izurieta et al.'s analysis explored the perception of scientific tourism and its contribution to the SDGs in the Ecuadorian Amazon, empowering the community and progressing eight SDGs. Birendra, Adity & Tek using Nepal as a case study, specifically reveal how tourism development has the potential to progress nearly all the SDGs, recognized in their discussion of the interconnections. Yet, the authors noted specific challenges for Nepal, given its lengthy political transitioning, dubious infrastructure, and concerns surrounding meeting the basic needs of its citizens, which could delay SDG progression.  4 Where to next? The United Nations has set 2030 as the target date for the achievement of the proposed 17 SDGs and as stated at the outset of our editorial we have now entered a Decade of Action  and must focus on accelerating global, local and people action (UN, 2020). While we announced our call for papers prior to the World Health Organization determining a Global Pandemic, significantly derailing the progression of the SDGs in many contexts, it is incumbent we reflect on a.) the impact of COVID-19 on the progression of the SDGs, b.) continue to consider diverse contexts regarding SDGs progression, and c.) pay particular consideration to tourism's role in progressing the SDGs in light of the contemporary halt to the tourism industry. Bruce Poon (2020) , tourism social entrepreneur, published an instabook early in the pandemic, encouraging industry stakeholders to use the interruption to business as an opportunity to consider how tourism could be reshaped, for the betterment of peoples and the planet. This is also reflected in recent work on redefining tourism (Gössling, Scott, & Hall, 2020 ; Higgins-Desbiolles, 2020 ; Higgins-Desbiolles et al., 2019 ), and work on degrowth (e.g., Hall, Lundmark & Zhang, 2021). Considering this work, we believe we are at a crossroads. When it is safe to resume travel how might we reshape the industry which has prioritized bringing benefits to some, at the costs of other humans and the planet? We are critical of the priorities of businesses operating within capitalist markets, driven by profit orientations. What may the restart of tourism look like? and where will sustainability and the SDGs fall on the priority list? Importantly, we must continue to consider the ways in which tourism may progress sustainable development and the SDGs. Perhaps considerations regarding how the SDGs could be used to disrupt the tourism industry in our considerations of recovering from the pandemic are needed. Furthermore, thinking around how COVID-19 may support building more resilient communities, and businesses, is going to warrant attention, and the SDGs may provide tourism stakeholders with some inspiration, as well as a canvas warranting iterative critique in our considerations tracking ahead. The global framework acts as a reminder that the status quo must continue to be challenged. Specifically, the growth trajectory supported by capitalism explicitly recognized and supported in SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production. This emphasis does little to support co-operation between the North and South which is essential for collectively addressing poverty and climate change (Walker, Pekmezovic, & Walker, 2019 ). Clearly, it is important to recognize that the business as usual neoliberal ideology will not help us in this moment, as we think through overcoming COVID-19 and its resulted impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the mindset, and behavior of different stakeholders including residents, tourists, and businesses. Understanding these changes to establish a more sustainable future for tourism and positive contribution to the SDGs is key, which should be considered in the process of tourism recovery. Moreover, we may reconsider our understanding of the contribution of tourism to different SDGs post vaccine. Our pre- COVID understandings about the incorporation of tourism and the SDGs might not be valid anymore, which highlights the importance of redefining these mutual contributions post COVID-19 vaccine. The application of technology has been accelerated during the pandemic, and the positive contribution of technology in tourism to achieve SDGs has been highlighted by several studies (e.g., Ali et al., 2020 ). However, understanding the impacts of such technology use to Co2 emissions is not widely understood, and deserves further attention in consideration of the SDGs. Accordingly, post vaccine, it might be time to think about if and/or how the adoption of technologies in tourism could facilitate the direction for more positive incorporations of tourism and SDGs. Planning, supporting, and executing a special issue during a pandemic is a reminder it takes a village to support such projects.
