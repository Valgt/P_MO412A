                  The exponential growth of food demand due to the increasing global population has the potential to seriously threaten the quality and quantity of food supplies due to climate change. This study explores the utilisation of green urban spaces for achieving food self-sufficiency by investigating the extent to which sustainable urban farms could be used to reduce the consumption of imported produce in the UK. It also examines urban farming stakeholders’ perspective on how food self-sufficiency can help realise the SDGs especially SDG 2 (Zero hunger) and SDG 13 (Climate action). The study adopts a mixed method approach through a survey with 115 respondents and semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 respondents from 4 different urban farming stakeholder groups. The findings of this study presented a strong correlation between stakeholders who had concerns about where their food came from and the carbon footprint of imported produce. The research shows that, urban farms will no doubt play a vital role in the future of food security in our cities/communities and that the SDGs could be realised through sustainable urban farms implemented within the relevant planning regulations/policies.

Green urban space is crucial to city health and well-being (Stoltz and Shaffer, 2018 ) and to address these global challenges, ‘Green Cities’ concept has been adopted globally since it offers green solutions through sustainable practices such as mixed land use through planning systems that aim to meet ecological, economic, and social needs (Li et al., 2016 ). Unplanned urbanisation reduces green public places’ ability to enhance air quality, mitigate Urban Heat Island (UHI) and stimulate physical activity (Li et al., 2016 ). Food systems and green spaces should be planned and maintained collaboratively to reduce pollution, increase the consumption of nutritious, safe food, and promote active excellent health. Food self-sufficiency means meeting a population’s consumption demands through production, not buying or importing (Baer-Nawrocka and Sadowski, 2019 ). An ‘Edible Infrastructure’ or ‘edible city’ suggests an enclosed loop of energy, nutrients, and waste cycles that might help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (Chatterjee et al., 2020 ). Ecovillages are one of the attempts to shift food production toward sustainable food systems. Such green communities can be considered a model where sustainability, in relation to food production, is a crucial component (Ulug et al., 2021 ). Ecovillages are collaborative communities that strive to integrate sustainable practices into daily living, emphasizing sustainable environmental and community development (Gillman, 1991 ). The sustainable food system in the ecovillage prioritizes environmental, social, and economic issues by connecting people who produce with people who consume, reducing unfavourable external inputs, and promoting affordability and accessibility throughout the food chain (Blay-Palmer and Koc, 2010 ; Feenstra, 2002 ). The Vertical Farming (VF) is a sustainable agriculture practice that serves as a source of food supply within the urban regions (Khalil and Wahhab, 2020 ) by growing plants that are arranged in layers within a controlled environment (Chatterjee et al., 2020 ). This approach to farming takes advantage of green urban spaces such as abandoned spaces; warehouses, shipping containers or buildings. Food self-sufficiency has been achieved in many ways including backyard, communal allotment, rooftop, and alternative farms (Ayambire et al., 2019 ). High-tech farming fosters sustainable farming practices and helps achieve food self-sufficiency in urban areas. Both existing and modern city buildings can use high-tech indoor agricultural systems (Farhangi et al., 2020 ). VF also aims to improve urban food security by producing more food on less land (Chatterjee et al., 2020 ). Vertical agriculture involves growing plants in tiers, stacked several stories high. VFs employ hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics (Kalantari et al., 2017 ). Farhangi et al. (2020)  stated that the aeroponic system uses 90% less water than the most efficient hydroponics system. Hydroponics and aeroponics both grow plants without soil. Hydroponics replaces soil with a new medium, which can be anything that can absorb and circulate nutrient-rich fluid (Chatterjee et al., 2020 ). In aeroponics, nutrients are sprayed directly on the roots. Aeroponics offers a yield and plant growth advantage over hydroponics, but hydroponics wins when initial cost is an issue if a stable power supply is not available (Al-Kodmany, 2018 ). Since VF may be implemented into tall structures, according to Shahda and Megahed (2022) , food production in skyscrapers and tall buildings is a possible way to maximise limited green urban space in cities and a solution to environmental problems and food poverty after the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, Tablada et al. (2020)  also stated that adapting existing buildings for VFs will not only relieve housing and shelter needs but also transform buildings and communities into a food-production built environment. In addition, Shahda and Megahed (2022)  noted that modifying an existing building for VF was a sustainable way to produce food because it would produce more food with less water and land than traditional farming. The American Planning Association (APA, 2007 ) recommended integrating food systems planning into urban planning to address urban food production. According to Al-Kodmany (2018) , transporting food by freight generates twice as much CO2  as maritime freight. Fresh produce must be transported swiftly, thus, maritime shipment is not an option. Access to locally grown produce on urban farms could reduce transportation’s climatic impact. Sustainable urban food production and consumption reduces long-distance food transport, cooling, and storage energy (Lwasa et al., 2014 ). Urban farms reduce environmental and climate consequences because food is not shipped or imported (International Resource Panel, 2021 ). Reducing built-environment resource use helps create more resilient cities. If cities generate sustainable local resources, they may become more resilient (Benis et al., 2017 ). The built environment has a key role in maintaining biodiversity through design, asset maintenance, and SDG realization since biodiversity and human well-being are vital in construction (Opoku, 2019 ). Urban farming could make a significant impact on 8 of the 17 UN goals directly, all of which links to reducing poverty (SDG 1). This to a larger extent shows the interrelatedness and interdependency of one SDG to each other. Urban farms can help the realisation of the following SDGs including SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health & well-being), SDG 4 (Quality education), SDG 8 (Decent jobs & economic growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation & Industry), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities & communities), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (Climate action), by ensuring that the food system meets the requirements of all residents, regardless of where they live or how much they earn (see Table 1  ) (Nicholls et al., 2020 ; Manila Standard, 2021 ). It is however important to note that the realisation of SDGs 11, 12 and 13 is affected by the level of sustainability of the urban farming systems. This is dependant on the realisation of existing green designs by considering the impact of the entire life cycle of the existing food production system through environmental life cycle assessment. Conventional agriculture methods contribute to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional agricultural methods release most of the soil’s initial carbon supply as CO2 , raising atmospheric CO2  concentrations, according to Crews and Rumsey (2017) . Bennedetti et al. (2023)  support the development of sustainable urban farming models that can be adaptable to different contexts based on the socio-economic and environmental contextual factors in cities in the Global North and Global South. This study is therefore positioned in the Global North context even though findings could be applied in the Global South. The value of this study is to provide the urban stakeholders an insight into the possible utilisation of green urban space for urban farms in achieving the 2030 agenda for the sustainable development. The study therefore aims to explore the utilisation of green urban spaces for achieving food self-sufficiency and the realisation of the sustainable development goals. The objectives of the study are to: 1) explore green urban design in achieving food self-sufficiency, 2) examine the role of urban farms in reducing food importation, 3) investigate how urban farms contributes to the realisation of the SDGs.  2 Materials and methods This study used a mixed method approach which can generate ‘profoundly novel empirical insights’ by combining both qualitative and quantitative research methods (Malina et al., 2010 ). One hundred and fifteen (115) respondents from the UK were surveyed including an interview with twelve (12) professionals in February/March 2021. First, a quantitative study examined stakeholders attitudes and knowledge about urban farms and how to achieve food sufficiency through green urban designs. The second phase of data collection involves a semi-structured interview with stakeholders to understand their perspectives on the role of urban farms on achieving food sufficiency and the realisation of the SDGs. Focusing on the research objectives, it is expected that urban stakeholders will be more aware of urban farms, hence more sensitive of where their food originates from, and that they will be more prepared to pay a greater price premium for such items. An online administered questionnaire were used to acquire quantitative data on the role of urban farming towards the realisations of the SDGs. The questionnaire was formulated around the following broad themes aligning with the research questions: 1) green urban space design and food self-sufficiency, 2) reducing food importation through urban farms, and 3) the role of urban farms in achieving the SDGs. The survey was created using online survey platform Survey Monkey and administered electronically through a snowballing sampling technique. A link to the designed questionnaire was emailed to the respondents who agreed to take part in the study until a sample size of 120 was achieved. However, 115 respondents completed the questionnaire fully for analysis, representing a response rate of 95.8%. The survey data was analysed using advanced statistical techniques in Microsoft Excel. From vertical farmers to sustainability professionals, four urban farming stakeholder groups were interviewed for qualitative data. A semi-structured interview was used to acquire open-ended qualitative data regarding a participant’s perspectives on the use of green urban space for urban farms towards the realisation of the SDGs. The interview sought input from urban farm stakeholders including retailers/restaurants, VF operators, local council employees, and construction sustainability professionals. According to Guest et al. (2006) , 12 interviews of a homogenous sample are enough to reach saturation. Four participants from each stakeholder group were chosen and contacted via email; 12 replied, leading to interviews. Purposive sampling was used for the interview, thus, participants were chosen because of their experience and knowledge in the topic, which ensured they had the necessary expertise to answer the interview questions (Cresswell and Plano Clark, 2011 ). The interview data was analysed using qualitative content analysis which initially involved extensive immersion in the interview data. After this a process of coding and grouping responses by theme is followed . Several types of analysis are grouped under the heading of content analysis, and therefore it is important to define the process this research used for repeatability and validity of the data analysis. Content analysis used qualitative data to discover themes or common concepts, which were used to infer text messages. A speech-to-text transcription application/tool (Otter) was used to transform recorded phone calls into text for phone interviews lasting between 30 min and 40 min.  3 Results This section examined urban farming stakeholders’ roles and perspectives on urban farm development as a catalyst for achieving the SDGs. 3.1 Results of quantitative data One-hundred and fifteen (115) participants were largely based in South England with a 79:36 split biased towards urban areas; Fig. 1   illustrates the split and location of the participants. This urban area dominance is ideal due to urban farms being targeted in these areas; therefore, urban stakeholders’ opinions were more significant. Fig. 2   explored how conscientious the research participants were regarding where their food comes from. The data shows that the more conscientious people were about where their food comes from, the more concerned they were about the carbon footprint of imported produce. sets. This meant, those who care about where their food came from, were concerned about the carbon footprint of imported produce, and this stimulated potential interest towards urban farms. The study further examined the views of stakeholders on how much price premium they were willing to pay for local produce as a means to reduce food importation. From Fig. 3 , it is  evident that most participants would be willing to pay up to 30% more; statistically, 66% of participants stated that they would be willing to pay between 20% and 30% premium. The relationship between how conscientious the participants were about where their food came from and how much of premium they were willing to pay were also assessed and found to be positive. The Spearman’s Calculation R -value was 0.212; the correlation was positive but relatively weak, reflecting a gap beyond which people were not willing to pay of around 30% premium.  3.2 Results of qualitative data The study interviewed stakeholders across four groups involved in the progression of urban farms and the realisation of the SDGs, including Retailers/Restaurants, from independent to chain restaurants; Urban farmers to determine how viable urban farms as a business model can reduce the consumption of imported goods and achieving the SDGs; Research participants who were Local Council members to help examine planning implications and construction sustainability professionals view on urban farms as a potential driver to the realisation of the SDGs. Table 2   presents a profile of the stakeholders interviewed. When respondents were asked if urban farms could be a feasible economic model for achieving food self-sufficiency, and the results demonstrate that when done at the right scale, they can be. However, idealistic urban farms have limits, including access to urban space. The size of the premises needed to make the economics work can be hard to come by in central urban areas, meaning peri‑urban areas may be better suited for sites of production. Urban farms are part of the solution to achieving food self-sufficiency and that innovative urban farming is to complement existing urban agriculture and conventional agriculture. Urban farming with various scales therefore provides a potential contribution to food security by supporting local food supply and reducing dependency on the rural-urban food value chain (Armanda et al., 2019 ). Available data shows that the UK construction industry created 100 million tonnes of rubbish a year, generating a third of the UK’s total yearly waste (Planning and Construction News, 2020 ). As mentioned, hydroponics requires a substrate, which can be gravel, styrofoam, sand, or sawdust - all building site materials. So, urban farms can minimize costs of construction waste to landfill by donating them for use in urban farms. In terms of how urban farms could cut imports, interviewees feels urban farms could reduce some imported commodities,  particularly leafy greens, herbs and salad leaves, many of which are imported to the UK’ were crucial products that can be grown locally in urban farms rather than imported. Urban farms would have positive impact on the community in the area of community engagement. In addition to food safety, supply chain resilience is an essential factor that can be addressed using urban farms. Sourcing food produce from different countries is challenging so streamlining and shortening the supply chain through urban farms would be beneficial. Again, the research participants were asked about how urban farms could help achieve the SDGs. The general trend was that sustainable urban farms can help achieve the SDGs, but they are only part of a solution. However, the research respondents agree that urban farms are a partial solution and suggested alternative solutions. Sustainable urban farming can produce food with minimal water inputs and is also extremely space-efficient; this gives opportunities to grow food for the growing global population without causing damage to natural habitats, etc. Table 3   provides a summary of interview results across the research themes aligned with the research objectives.   4 Discussion Both the survey and interviews results showed that consumers wanted to know where their food came from and the impact of imports on the environment. The results show that 66% of participants would pay a 20% to 30% price premium for locally grown produce, indicating a market for urban farms despite the premium. Peri-urban is a theme throughout the interviews since urban land prices are much higher than peri-urban prices. The small cost of transporting produce into inner cities would offset the costs of operating farms in inner city areas. This depends on the city landscape because land prices and availability vary throughout urban areas of the country/world. The acceptance of remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced office space use, making spaces available for urban farms. Sustainable urban farms could give increased social value, employee engagement, health and well-being, and a sense of community, more than sustainability standards such as BREEAM. Urban farms will just be part of the solution for lowering our imports, according to the interview results. Certain herbs and spices can please global preferences without sacrificing sustainability and food mileage. For example, the British Herb Trade Association believes that growing wages, a lack of labour, and an uncertain climate make it more attractive for overseas growers to export fresh herbs to the UK (Prestwich, 2020 ). The UK is the 4th largest importer of fresh or chilled vegetables and fresh herbs in Europe (CBI Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2020 ). Urban farms could reduce the need to import herbs. The analysis of the interview data shows that zero hunger (SDG 2), good health and well-being (SDG 3), sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12), and climate action (SDG 13) were cited by interviewees as some of the goals that urban farms can contribute directly to its realisation. However, SDGs 4, 8, 9, and 11 are indirectly impacted by the whole urban farming process as presented in Table 1 . For example, the proper implementation of urban farms could enhance food security in cities and communities, and also serve as a key source of household income (Poulsen et al., 2015 ). The development of urban farms will not only assist in reducing the harm to natural habitats, but it will also stimulate health and well-being through the consumption of the products and the physical activity of caring to the crops, driving the achievement of multiple SDGs. The findings support the work of Nicholls et al. (2020)  which argue that urban farms has the potential to contribute to food security (SDG 2) and improve human health and well-being (SDG 3). Food security and healthy diets have become more important during the COVID-19 pandemic; urban farms can therefore help in this situation. Urban farms are seen as a way for people to learn how to start small farms, which would reduce consumption. Urban farms or VFs engage a community to tend the crops, getting health advantages from both.  5 Conclusions Urban farms will feed cities in the future with the growing global population increases for food consumption. This paper sought to explore the role of urban farms in achieving food sufficiency and reduce imported produce. It also examine how urban farms can drive the realisation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals. Implementing sustainable urban farming systems with green urban space design can lessen human-caused environmental problems like climate change. Sustainable urban farms enhance the development of more resilient cities, the use of green urban spaces to achieve food self-sufficiency and encouraged healthy diets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Encouraging the adoption of sustainable urban farming system would also help achieve the SDGs such as goals 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13. In the event of a pandemic, transitioning green urban places into urban farms has become increasingly viable. Increasing office space could be a prospect for urban farms, especially as firms try to boost their social value and office community. The study’s findings contribute to the current body of knowledge on the link between green urban spaces and SDGs by revealing the significance of sustainable urban farming as a green initiative, the potential they possess to mitigate the adverse effects of climate crises and urbanisation on the environment, society, and economy. It is recommended that further research is undertaken to determine what construction materials can be used for urban farms and the role of the construction industry in promoting urban farming. Again research into renewable energy source for the lighting and ventilation for hydroponics and aeroponics that doesn’t produce CO2  emissions will need to be explored in order to truly make urban farms sustainable. Due to the severe lack of awareness of the potential urban farms possessed, the study concluded that knowledge deficiency hindered the development of urban farms and recommended that education ought to be improved amongst all stakeholders of the potential of urban farms in achieving the sustainable development goals.
