                  Academia and industry have strengthened each other under the guidelines of regulatory institutions to contribute theoretical knowledge and practical solutions for society, which can be presented in a combination of publishing research and filing patents. In the case of municipal solid waste management (MSWM), a great transformation from a linear to a circular view has been in process. In this study, we investigated the role of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in MSWM-related development and transformation. The authors examined the contributions of academic and industrial spheres to MSWM in the past 70 years by examining Web of Science's Core Collection and Derwent Innovations Index. The results showed that SDGs not only accelerated the research on MSWM but also pulled MSWM-related knowledge and innovation to new fronts that focus on sustainable and circular methods. Based on the current findings, we derived implications for academia, industry, and policymakers.

These guidelines address the global challenges that humans face, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice (UN, 2020 ). The United Nations has emphasized that SDGs are more important than ever, since they can be a crucial framework for COVID-19 recovery (UN, 2022 ). Notably, Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) can be considered a multidisciplinary issue that significantly affects the economy, society, and the environment (Mohsenizadeh et al., 2020 ). When quantifying the footprints of MSWM over the spectrum of SDGs, the literature has shown that MSWM has a direct or indirect effect on each target of the SDGs (Appendix A ). However, several countries have struggled to connect the SDGs with MSWM (Silva et al., 2019 ), especially in developing and emerging regions (Pérez et al., 2021 ). Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) can be interchangeably used with rubbish, garbage, or trash, which refers to items people throw away, that is, household organic and inorganic wastes (U.S.EPA, 2016 ). Kaza et al. (2018)  defined MSW as a combination of residential, commercial, and institutional wastes. The components of MSW vary widely within municipalities and countries (K.K. Prajapati et al., 2021 ), which are caused by the rate of urbanization (Elsaid and Aghezzaf, 2015 ), geographical location (Das et al., 2019 ), socioeconomic conditions (Iqbal et al., 2020 ), industrial structure, and waste management regulations (Abdel-shafy and Mansour, 2018 ). As a result, there are several definitions of MSW in the literature, (Appendix B ). MSWM is a multidisciplinary process (Hirpe and Yeom, 2021 ) that comprises several stages, including waste collection, transportation and storage, treatment, and disposal (Dewi et al., 2010 ). According to the literature, the stages of MSWM are reported and documented in various ways, (Appendix C ). As MSWM is a complex system, it can be comprehensively examined through technical, environmental, financial, sociocultural, institutional, and legal lenses (Guerrero et al., 2013 ). Soltani et al. (2015)  also emphasized that MSWM can be affected by environmental, social, and economic conditions. Despite constant efforts, almost all countries have faced serious challenges in MSWM. The World Bank (2019)  predicted the account of MSW would reach an alarming height of 3.40 billion tons by the year 2050. In many countries, especially in developing regions, organic and inorganic solid wastes are mixed while collecting, transporting, and disposing that reduces the waste recycling rate (Xin et al., 2020 ). Landfilling and incineration are the most frequent disposal approaches for MSW worldwide (Cheng et al., 2020 ). Although landfilling is a relatively easy and low-cost approach for MSW disposal (P. Prajapati et al., 2021 ), it potentially affects life on land and water (Zhang et al., 2019 ). Moreover, incineration not only leads to severe air pollution but also causes social problems (Zhang et al., 2016 ). In other words, MSWM has a significant impact on social, ecological, and economic fronts (Tasi et al., 2020 ). However, in contrast to the linear view model, MSW can be considered a valuable source of renewable energy under the circular view (Ding et al., 2021 ). Through waste-to-energy or energy-from-waste conversion, MSW has gained strategic value as a source of renewable energy (Nanda and Berruti, 2021 ). Therefore, academia and industry have been consistently exploring the best possible ways to optimize MSWM operations, minimizing ecological footprints by maximizing circular approaches. In the academic sphere, several studies have concluded that waste minimization and the 3Rs (reuse, recycling, and recovery) are constructive measures to deal with the carbon footprints of MSWM. Moreover, Karak et al. (2012)  emphasized that the importance of political motivation in the field of MSWM. Luo et al. (2021)  argued that the sustainable development of MSWM requires integrated concerns from economic, environmental, societal, technological, and energy perspectives. Wang et al. (2022)  found that public participation is the key to achieving sustainable MSWM, which means that effective communication and education are necessary. Wang et al. (2020)  argued that waste sorting at the source requires effective public education and support facilities for waste separation. In the industrial sphere, technological advancements can be seen as a critical factor in optimizing and practicing MSWM (Wang et al., 2022 ). Tan et al. (2015)  mentioned that techno-driven development in MSWM has a greener impact on energy, economic, and environmental (3E) concerns. Mohsenizadeh et al. (2020)  evaluated how a geographical information system can help optimize the logistics and operations of MSWM. Furthermore, Vyas et al. (2022)  reviewed waste-to-energy technologies for converting MSW and other feedstocks into electricity, hydrogen gas, bioethanol, and other value-added products. Emerging technologies for MSW resource utilization are being developed worldwide (Ding et al., 2021 ). Based on the literature discussed above, there have been numerous efforts contributed by academic and industrial stakeholders to the sustainable future of MSWM. MSWM still is one of the serious challenges globally. However, in recent years, especially since the declaration of the SDGs, there is a greater transformation other than switching from a linear to a circular way in the field of MSWM. It is quite necessary to analyze past and current research outcomes of MSWM as well as discover future trends, which investigates from both academic and industrial (knowledge and innovation) perspectives. For achieving this goal, this study created an atypical and original research method that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. On the one hand, data visualization and exploration of academic literature were performed by CiteSpace and VOS Viewer. On the other hand, historical data of patents were analyzed by machine learning techniques (NLTK and YAKE) with Python. Such research method clearly presented the track of intellectual growth and footprint of technological advances in the field of MSWM. Therefore, this study offered a more holistic and detailed understanding of MSWM, which can be an effective method to make recommendations for researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers. For obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of MSWM research, this study included two distinct aims: (1) to analyze the different trends in MSWM-related research (academia) and innovation (industry) during the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods, and (2) discovering what aspects of the SDGs were addressed by academic and industrial stakeholders during the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods. Specifically, this study examined internationally published research and registered patents to map the roles and contributions of academia and related industries in the sustainable development and evolution of MSWM. The following sections explore the intellectual growth and technological advances of MSWM from the academic (Study 1) and industrial (Study 2) perspectives.  2 Academic perspective (Study 1) 2.1 Methods The bibliometric approach adopts a quantitative method to uncover thematic views. It helps examine the association and behavior of the nodes (authors, articles, keywords, journals, contributing institutions, and countries) within the intellectual growth of a specific research area (White and McCain, 1989 ). It can also further help highlight the origin, development, and potential future trends in a particular domain by performing longitudinal data analysis (Erar, 2002 ). The bibliometric approach is valuable because it (1) helps perform quantitative data analysis on large datasets (Chen and Ibekwe-Sanjuan, 2010 ), (2) facilitates the generation of temporal data based on the co-occurrence of nodes and co-citation-based big data analysis (Wang et al., 2016 ), and (3) can provide hotspots and turning points that drive multidisciplinary growth in a specific research domain (Seyedghorban et al., 2016 ). A detailed brief of the tools used for bibliometric analysis (CiteSpace and VOS Viewer) is listed in Appendix C . 2.1.1 Searching source and strategy The authors designed a search query to examine articles related to MSWM and the SDGs. Specifically, a comprehensive list of synonyms and closely related terms was reviewed. Moreover, three experts specializing in environmental studies and public policy were invited to revise the search query to ensure validity and reliability. Noticeably, while designing the search query, this study included the words “urban” and “city” as possible alternates for “municipal.” Moreover, the words “solid” interchanged with “trash,” “litter,” “rubbish,” and “garbage” were also used as alternatives for “waste” to maximize the coverage of the concept. Finally, all 17 SDGs were included in the search query to avoid query coverage issues (Appendix D ). A total of 1017 research articles published between 1994 and 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) core. This study only emphasizes WoS because it covers the world's leading publications from every possible multidisciplinary view and can be considered the world's most comprehensive data repository for academic research (Anwar et al., 2022 ). In the crawled data, the nodes (articles, authors, countries, institutions, journals and keywords) reported without any change or modification as provided by the WoS database. Furthermore, several researchers have mentioned that bibliographic details in WoS are the most comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and reliable compared to other repositories (Anwar et al., 2019 ; Asmi et al., 2019 ). Finally, to ensure data reliability and relevance, the authors manually filtered records that were observed to be irrelevant or duplicated.   2.2 Bibliometric findings for the academic sphere In line with the research questions stated in section 1 , the current study examined the growth of relevant literature in the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods. First, a descriptive analysis was conducted for each period. This included a brief view of the nodes (total publications, number of authors, contributing journals, and countries). Furthermore, a co-citation-based cluster analysis was conducted for the research published during the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods. In addition, co-occurrence-based keyword and country-level analyses were performed to highlight dominating nodes in the micro- and macro-structure of the concerned research area during each period. 2.2.1 Primary observations In the pre-SDG period, this study obtained 370 research publication records from January 1, 1900, to December 31, 2015, which were obtained from 167 academic journals and written by 981 authors from 71 countries. The collected data from the pre-SDG period included 13,998 bibliometric references with an average citation count per item of 37.83 and an H-index of 64. In contrast, from the post-SDG declaration period, this study acquired 647 research publications, which were published from January 1, 2016, to the present (April 23, 2022) in 275 academic journals and written by 2187 authors from 96 countries. The collected data from the post-SDG declaration period included 7128 bibliometric references with an average citation count per item of 11.02 and an H-index of 39. A graphical view of academic research for each year is shown in Fig. 1  . The collected bibliometric records can help further examine co-citation and co-occurrence. The prominent contributing journals, authors, and research areas in the pre- and post-SDG declaration periods are listed in Table 1  .  2.2.2 Intellectual growth pre- and post-SDG declaration periods In the pre-SDG declaration period, the caption “municipal solid waste” (silhouette score = 0.966) was the most prominent cluster. It emphasized related policy reforms and barriers in MSWM while implementing administrative policies (Sevigné Itoiz et al., 2013 ). The second most prominent cluster, “container system” (silhouette score = 0.88), underlined the ecological impact of waste containers in municipalities (Rives et al., 2010 ). The next cluster, “municipal solid waste management system” (silhouette score = 0.916), was comprised of practices of effective and sustainable MSWM systems across the globe. The fourth cluster, “technological challenge” (silhouette score = 0.819), signified the role of technology in the sustainable MSWM systems (Vásquez et al., 2014 ). The fifth cluster highlighted the best MSWM practices. Feo and Malvano (2009)  explored the best MSWM system by analyzing 11 environmental impact categories produced by 12 management scenarios. The rest of the most vibrant clusters included “life cycle” (silhouette score = 0.916) and “global warming factor” (silhouette score = 0.968). The common theme of these clusters was the effort to quantify the ecological footprint of MSWM (Hultman and Corvellec, 2012 ). In the post-SDG declaration period, the most prominent cluster was “life cycle assessment” (silhouette score = 0.858). Research associated with this cluster has emphasized the positive effect of life cycle assessment for MSWM (Ripa et al., 2017 ). This was followed by the cluster “different municipal solid waste management scenarios” (silhouette score = 0.994), which comprised research analyzing/comparing different regions or different scenarios of MSWM. For example, Liu et al. (2017)  examined greenhouse gas emissions from different MSWM scenarios in China through carbon and energy flow analyses. The third major cluster, “financial risk” (silhouette score = 0.851), focused on the financial assessment of MSWM. Diaz-Barriga-Fernandez et al. (2018)  presented an optimization formulation for strategic planning in an MSWM system by analyzing financial risks and uncertainty. The fourth cluster, “Best‒worst method” (silhouette score = 0.761), aimed to construct and propose novel methodologies or optimized solutions for sustainable MSWM. The fifth cluster, “municipal solid waste generation composition” (silhouette score = 0.706), investigated the conditions of MSW generation, composition, management, and related problems. The sixth cluster, “COVID-19 pandemic” (silhouette score = 0.848), highlighted the negative impact of COVID-19 on MSWM. For example, Kulkarni and Anantharama (2020)  examined various aspects of MSWM during the COVID-19 outbreak and presented challenges and opportunities. The seventh cluster, “performance assessment model” (silhouette score = 0.94), emphasized the role of performance assessment of MSWM systems, such as examining MSWM systems in a fuzzy rule-based modeling (Alhumid et al., 2019 ). The eighth cluster was “circular economy goal” (silhouette score = 0.845), which highlighted how efficient MSWM is necessary for implementing circular economy goals. For example, Di Foggia and Beccarello (2021)  proposed a waste-effective waste management system to achieve circular economic goals in Italy.  2.2.3 Author- and keyword-based trends pre- and post-SDG declaration periods In the author citation network analysis, from the pre-SDG declaration, the highly cited authors included Gordon Huang (also recorded as Guo He Huang) from the University of Regina (Regina, Canada) and Beijing Normal University (Beijing, China); Małgorzata Grodzińska-Jurczak from Jagiellonian University (Krakow, Poland); and Ali El Hanandeh from Griffith University (Brisbane, Australia). In contrast, the authors from the post-SDG declaration period included Vincenzo Torretta and Navarro Ferronato from the University of Insubria (Varese, Italy) and Sergio Ulgiati from the Parthenope University of Naples (Naples, Italy) and Beijing Normal University (Beijing, China) (Appendix A ). During the keyword co-occurrence analysis, from the pre-SDG declaration period, “sustainability,” “sustainable development,” “life cycle assessment,” and “energy recovery” were noted as attributes that sustainably addressed the top 30 co-occurring keywords. However, in the post-SDG declaration period, “circular economy” and “recycling” were added. Noticeably, in recent years, newly added keywords included “COVID-19,” “circular economy,” “sustainability assessment,” “sustainability evaluation,” “sustainability indicators,” and “sustainable development goals,” which can be predicted as dominating future trends in the unified intellectual growth of MSWM and SDGs (Appendix A ).  2.2.4 Contributing regions and institutions pre- and post-SDG declaration periods During the country co-occurrence analysis, from the pre-SDG declaration period, the dominant regions in the literature included China, the United States, Canada, England, and Japan. Conversely, in the post-SDG declaration period, noticeable countries included Brazil, India, Malaysia, Ghana, and South Africa. This signifies that the SDGs increased the researchers' attention on developing regions, which had rarely been observed in the pre-SDG declaration period (Appendix B ). In the institution-level analysis, the dominant institutions from the pre-SDG declaration period included the University of Regina (Canada), North China Electric Power University (China), Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Greece), and Technical University of Denmark (Denmark), which emphasized concerns related to waste recycling, MSWM planning and management, lifecycle assessment, and sustainability, respectively. During the post-SDG declaration period, the leading institutions included the Chinese Academy of Science (China), the University of Tehran (Iran), the Indian Institutes of Technology (India), and the University of Johannesburg (South Africa). Specifically, these institutions highlighted the correlation between MSWM and SDGs by connecting eco-environmental science, disposal management, community development, environmental protection, and circular economy to MSWM (Appendix B ).    3 Industrial perspective (Study 2) 3.1 Methods In this study, we performed a statistical analysis of patents’ historical data to explore the influence of SDGs. To investigate the trends, patterns, and relationships among patents and SDGs, the historical data of patents were extracted from the WoS Derwent Innovations Index (database). Notably, the default settings for WoS were used for data extraction. In the crawled data, the patents-related detail (i.e. country) were reported as provided by the WoS database without any change or modification in the collected data. The extracted patent information was divided into two segments: patents published before (before 2015) and after the SDGs (2016 to present). Each patent record combines its information in the following tags: PN, TI, GA, AB, TF, DC, MC, CP, and CR of patents for statistical analysis. The total number of patents was 9612 before 2015 and 9216 after 2015. 3.1.1 Analysis tools This study used PyCharm1  1 https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ .   (one of the integrated development environments to write Python code and configurations), which is a well-known open-source tool for software development among researchers because of its keyboard-centric approach, intelligent code completion, on-the-fly error checking, quick fixes, automated code refactoring, and rich navigation capabilities. The present study analyzed patent information regarding intellectual growth, trends, and significance. Different Python scripts were written for this analysis. Moreover, the Python Natural Language Toolkit2  2 https://www.nltk.org/ .   (NLTK) was used to extract keywords from the patents’ textual information according to the SDGs, as NLTK performs better for text computation in contrast to other text processing libraries, e.g., spaCy3  3 https://spacy.io/ .  . Recent studies have suggested machine learning techniques that can extract and rank keywords according to the semantic representation of the text (Goldberg, 2015 ; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004 ). Various techniques are available for extractive summarization and ranking of keywords, such as TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004 ), RAKE (Rose et al., 2010 ), IBM NLU (Vergara, 2017 ), KEA (Witten et al., 1999 ), and YAKE (Campos et al., 2018 ). However, YAKE yields the most accurate results for automatic keyword extraction or a single document (Campos et al., 2018 ).  3.1.2 Analysis strategy The authors performed text preprocessing and extracted keywords based on their ranks. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques (Cheng et al., 2021 ; Umer et al., 2020 ) were leveraged to preprocess each patent's textual information, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization. The text used in the patents is domain-dependent, and YAKE is domain-independent. Therefore, YAKE was modified for keyword ranking by leveraging the methodology proposed by Illahi et al. (2021) . The following pseudocodes were implemented to analyze patents' intellectual development, trends, and significance.1) To analyze intellectual growth pre- and post-SDG declaration, the cited patent (CP)-related information was first extracted from the patents' historical data. Second, the number of CPs for each patent was computed. Consequently, the textual information of CPs was converted to decimals. Finally, the converted data were sorted to identify the most influential patents pre- and post-SDG declaration.  2) To identify the patent trends pre- and post-SDG declaration, the textual information (Title (TI), Abstract (AB), and Technological Focus (TF)) of patents from historical data was first combined and converted into lowercase font. Then, the percentage of SDGs for each patent was computed. Finally, the top trends among patents pre- and post-SDG declaration were identified (attached as Supplementary Material).  3) The MC and DC tags were examined to consider the significance of Derwent Manual Codes and Servant Class Codes pre- and post-SDG declaration. A list of unique MCs/DCs was obtained from the patents, and the percentage of each unique MC/DC was computed.      3.2 Analysis As stated in Section 3.1 , data was collected from Derwent Innovations Index of WoS, based on a search query designed to address all aspects of MSWM (listed in Appendix D ). Further relevance and relatedness with any of the SDGs were examined by NLP techniques. A total of 18,828 patents were collected from WoS. However, after further analysis, it could be concluded that each registered patent can comprise multiple patent IDs registered in different countries and within multiple categories. The initial findings concluded that 38,496 patents were registered in 59 countries in total. China (count = 13,045), Japan (count = 4748), the United States (count = 4115), and Spain (count = 2966) were the dominant contributors to the industrial front. When comparing the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods, Japan could be noted as the most dominant country in the pre-SDG declaration period. However, China's contribution was distinguishable in the post-SDG declaration period, as shown in Fig. 2  . 3.2.1 Patent citation before and after SDG declaration The patents with the highest citation count from the pre-SDG declaration period mostly addressed issues related to waste (refuse) collection, which includes household, organic, and agricultural wastes. Furthermore, aspects related to waste crushing, combustion, and disposal were also considered to be the dominant issues in industrial concerns. The list of highly cited patents from the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods is listed in Appendix E . Surprisingly, in the past decade, the SDG declaration has pushed many key industrial players to act more responsibly. The same trend could be noted for MSWM-related industrial fronts, as all the top 10 highly cited patents in the post-SDG declaration period emphasized the role of conversion, conservation, and recycling. The leading patents in the citation count were discussions on fermentation, waste treatment, and energy generation through waste. Therefore, science and technology will lead the industrial fronts of MSWM in the future.  3.2.2 Patent trends/keywords pre- and post-SDG declaration periods To briefly compare and analyze the trend of the content discussed in the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods, NLP-based semantic analysis was performed, as discussed in section 3.1.2 . This included counting the frequency of words that can help further score the importance of any topic, word, and meaning. The title, abstract, and technological focus of each obtained patent was examined, and the top 30 keywords observed in the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods were computed and compared, as listed in Table 2  . When comparing the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods, it can be concluded that keywords, such as solid, method, furnace, acid, combustion, and treatment, are the prominent words that differentiate the pre-SDG declaration period from the post-SDG period. In other words, the distinctive words in the post-SDG declaration period included rubbish, utility, and crushing. However, from the keyword occurrence analysis, it can be concluded that there has been no drastic change in content in the last five decades, since more than 40% of the highly occurring keywords were noted as repeated among the patents that addressed innovation and development in waste collection, sorting, and treatment processes pre- and post-SDG declaration.  3.2.3 Patents’ technical areas pre- and post-SDG declaration periods The Derwent World Patents Index classifies all technologies into three broad sections: chemical, engineering, and electronic and electrical engineering. These classifications are further divided into classes based on the technical areas addressed by each patent. To define further technical areas, the alphabet from the section is combined with two-digit numbers. Upon examining the records of patents related to MSWM, a total of 41,790 patents were recorded in 263 technical areas. The highest count (4136) was recorded for P43, which addresses the mechanical attributes that can help clean or separate waste disposal. Q73 is noted as the second most noticeable technical area, with a count of 3,332, as shown in Fig. 3  . It includes the combustion apparatus and processes for lighting and heating. Q35 was the third most visible technical area, with a count of 3314. It includes patents that address refuse collection, conveyors, and sorting facilitation. Moreover, D15 (count = 2450) and P41 (count = 2321) were noted as the fourth and fifth most noticeable technical areas addressing the biological treatment of industrial waste/sewage and sorting/separating solid waste mechanically, respectively. However, when comparing the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods, no significant change in the trends in technical areas was observed.    4 Discussion MSWM can directly or indirectly affect each target of SDGs. Appropriate MSWM can be regarded as a critical measure to achieve the SDGs, especially post-COVID-19 (Bhakta et al., 2021 ). Therefore, it is time to assess how MSWM has been addressed by academia and industry to attain the intended targets of SDGs. In this study, a systematic approach was adopted to obtain, examine, and understand publications and patents related to MSWM from both pre-and post-SDG declaration periods. Moreover, this study showed how and what industrial and academic stakeholders in MSWM contributed constructively. To address research question 1, the trends in the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods in academia and industry were comparatively analyzed. From an academic perspective, the declaration of SDGs can be labeled as a revolutionary point in the growth of literature addressing MSWM, as the findings concluded that there was a 175% upshift in the growth in academic literature when comparing the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods. The depth and width of content and its nature have advanced in recent years while comparing the intellectual growth of literature related to MSWM in the pre-and post-SDG periods. For instance, in the pre-SDG declaration period, the content related to MSWM was usually categorized into a generalized view of MSW, commonly utilized MSWM systems, and best practices. Apart from the broader view of MSWM, technological shifts and global warming and its impact were also published. However, it is important to emphasize that the technological shifts and examination of ecological concerns in the pre-SDG declaration period were lower in terms of count, detail, and implications. Based on the findings detailed in section 2.2.2 , a multidisciplinary view was observed in the post-SDG declaration period. This shift in research growth illustrated academia's attention toward a multidimensional circular view of MSWM, which included the hard (MSWM scenarios, sustainability assessment) and soft aspects (financial risks, sustainability indicators, and evaluation). Moreover, COVID-19 pulled MSWM-related research into new health-centric issues and challenges for both active and passive stakeholders of MSWM (Appendix D ). Regarding the post-SDG declaration period, this study reported that the emerging clusters included “different municipal solid waste management scenario ,” “financial risk ,” “municipal solid waste generation composition ,” “COVID-19 pandemic ,” and “circular economy goal .” First, MSWM is addressed in multidisciplinary processes, which comprises waste collection, transportation and storage, treatment, and disposal. Except for traditional landfill and incineration, technologies for energy recovery from MSW can be divided into thermochemical (incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification) and biochemical conversions (anaerobic digestion and composting) (Shah et al., 2021 ). Second, “financial risk ” can be marked as a unique contribution to the post-SDG declaration period, which broadly emphasized that MSWM requires adequate financial support. An appropriate MSWM initiative not only requires related infrastructure, automatic management systems, and treatment facilities but also requires sufficient human resources, soft power, and critical stakeholder management. Third, regions with different urbanization or economic conditions generate different MSW compositions, which leads to the need for different treatments and procedures. As Ramachandra et al. (2018)  mentioned, understanding the composition of waste is an essential precondition for its effective treatment and management. Therefore, “municipal solid waste generation composition ” became a considerable part of the intellectual growth of MSWM-related literature in the post-SDG declaration period. Fourth, the cluster of “COVID-19 pandemic ” appeared in the intellectual growth of MSWM in the post-SDG declaration period, which indicates the impact of the pandemic on waste quantity, composition, and related risk, which has caused huge challenges in waste management practices (Fan et al., 2021 ; Kulkarni and Anantharama, 2020 ). Hantoko et al. (2021)  quantified the effects of COVID-19 on the quality and quantity of waste generation and provided short-, mid-, and long-term measures for waste management to cope with COVID-19. Lastly, the “circular economy goal ” can be counted as one of the key clusters. It encapsulated the essence and core of the SDGs, as the shift from a linear to a circular economy can also be found in the case of MSWM-related practices. Di Foggia and Beccarello (2021)  highlighted that the cost of waste management could be reduced by a system that conforms to circular economic goals. However, several studies have argued that circular economy model in MSWM is critical for achieving the SDGs post-COVID-19. In the author co-citation network analysis, most of the dominant authors who contributed to the MSWM-related literature shared affiliations from the developed and developing regions simultaneously. However, this analysis underlined the less prominent contribution of developing regions. Thus, the findings of the current study indicated that authors from developed regions have been dominant in the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods. A similar trend in prominent nodes from the developed region was observed in the country-level co-occurrence analysis. However, in terms of future predictions, this study highlighted that the developing regions across the globe, including the most populous regions (i.e., Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Russia, and Pakistan), can be considered prominent nodes among developing regions in future research. Interesting patterns were noted when comparing the growth of patent registrations. For instance, in the pre-SDG declaration period, apart from China's contribution, Japan was noted as the top contributor to the growth of patents, followed by the United States and the World Intellectual Patent Office. However, since 2016, China has secured a prominent position compared to the rest of the world. In recent years, China has registered more than 1500 patents per year that address MSWM-related issues. In the generalized view, China accounted for 96.9% of utility models, 51.7% of trademarks, and 52.3% of industrial design-related patent filings. There has been a recent debate regarding the market value of patents filed by China (Alex He, 2021 ). The same open-ended debate can be predicted in the case of MSWM-related patent growth originating in China. The trend of industrial patent filing was also examined using the keywords that were used in the title, abstract, and technology in the pre- and post-SDG declaration periods (Supplementary Material ). The top 20 keywords from the combined view of title, abstract, and technological focus are listed in Table 2 . This research concluded that most of the common trending keywords included “device,” “chamber,” “processing,” and “furnace.” However, the unique keywords from the pre-SDG declaration period were “acid,” “ash combustion,” and “treatment.” In contrast, the post-SDG declaration period keywords included “model,” “utility,” “crushing,” and “recycling.” However, most of the keywords from the pre- and post-SDG declaration periods addressed the process of conversion, processing, and treatment, as most of the patents were used in utility design and chemicals. However, a few keywords addressing sustainable behavior and practices could be noticed in the post-SDG-declaration period. The Derwent Innovation Index also offers a manual coding scheme to classify general, mechanical, and electric patents, and it covers a broad range of subject matter. When examining the manual coding of the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods, manual coding was also compared, as discussed in Section 3.2.3 . Based on the study findings, patent filings in both pre-and post-SDG declaration periods usually addressed sorting, cleaning, and waste disposal (P43), refuse collection and conveyors (Q35), chemical and biological treatment issues (D15), and combustion and process handling (Q73) as the most prominent manual codes used when filing MSWM-related patents. This observation aligns with the recent findings reported for keyword-based analysis of patents. As previously stated, the role of technology can be predicted as a game-changer in the future of MSWM-related patent filling, which can be proven by the presence of digital computers (T01) in manual coding by Derwent in the post-SDG declaration period. In particular, techno-driven innovations, such as robotic arms to sort waste, play an essential role in the future of the MSWM (Xiao et al., 2020 ). To answer research question 2, the keyword-based comparison and patents' nature and contextual reference to the SDGs were compared and analyzed. When examining the intellectual growth of the academic sphere, the findings showed that the literature addressing MSWM following the declaration of the SDGs increased by more than 200%. For instance, the findings reported 305 keywords from 370 research publications in the pre-SDG period, while 670 keywords were produced by 647 research publications in the post-SDG declaration period. During further analysis of the keywords, only 218 overlapping keywords were observed. Moreover, 81 keywords existed only in the first period, but 452 new keywords appeared in the post-SDG period. The SDGs can be considered as guidance for MSWM-related research and innovation on new fronts. Specifically, “circular economy” is the most visible node (among nodes with high strength in the keyword co-occurrence analysis) in MSWM research. The circular economy method in MSWM is critical for attaining the SDGs because it emphasizes the reduce‒reuse‒recovery‒recycle‒redesign‒remake model rather than the produce‒consume‒dispose model (Bhakta et al., 2021 ). Moreover, in recent years, “COVID-19” has appeared as a prominent keyword. COVID-19 has impeded the process of achieving the SDGs (Sachs et al., 2021 ). This has challenged the waste generation, collection, treatment, and disposal (Fan et al., 2021 ; Hantoko et al., 2021 ). As a result, the negative impact of COVID-19 and solutions for post-COVID recovery have been broadly discussed in the field of MSWM. Thus, further research is needed to make the journey toward achieving the SDGs more resilient and agile. Another emerging keyword is “new public management.” Although there is no best governance regime in the field of MSWM, new public management is increasing. The reason is that this regime can encourage the public sector to become more productive and innovative (Bugge et al., 2019 ). Patent citation analysis shows that the attention of industrial stakeholders has shifted from linear MSWM operations and management to a circular view. The highly cited patents from waste collection-related issues have shifted towards tools and techniques that can help in the process of conversion, conservation, and energy generation from waste and refuse collection. Moreover, the emerging role of technology in recent patent trends can predict its role in the future of MSWM-related patent filing and registration. Similarly, based on the findings of research question 1, sustainable practices in MSWM have been proven. However, to further examine which aspect of the SDGs has been researched, a machine learning-based algorithm was used, as discussed in Section 3.1 . The findings concluded that clean water and sanitation (SDG6) was one of the most prominent SDGs in both the pre-and post-SDG declaration periods, as its earliest trace can be seen in the year 1970 (Fig. 4  ). The second one is sustainable cities and communities (SDG11), which explicitly highlights the MSWM system's supply chain network and its footprint in the ecology of society and communities. And then, affordable and clean energy (SDG7), responsible consumption and production (SDG12), and life below water (SDG14) were noted as key aspects addressed by the industry during the pre-SDG declaration period, and these SDGs still comprise the dominant position among the industrial issues currently addressed by industrial players. When examining the post-SDG declaration period, ourfindings indicated that zero hunger (SDG2), good health and wellbeing (SDG3), industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG9), and life on land (SDG15) are the key aspects that can be marked as significantly addressed by the industry. In summary, it can be concluded that the academic sphere significantly addresses the soft aspects of SDGs and provides a driving force to industrial concerns and priorities, as a significant shift in industrial concern can be seen when comparing pre-and post-SDG declaration periods. However, the hard aspects mostly dominate the industrial sphere, as most of the innovation and technological focus is on addressing the conversion, processing, and treatment for collecting, transferring, sorting, and transforming MSW.  5 Conclusion This study reported that research on MSWM has significantly increased since the declaration of the SDGs in 2015. MSWM has addressed almost all the SDGs. It includes social, economic, and ecological fronts for creating sustainable opportunities. However, it can be predicted that the challenges will be more serious and complex in the post-COVID-19 period, as the circular view is now encountering an increasing amount of hard (MSWM scenarios and sustainability assessment) and soft issues (financial risks, sustainability indicators, and evaluation, and governance and policies) in MSWM practices. This systematic review employed big data analysis, where data visualization, exploration of academic literature performed by CiteSpace, and historical data of patents were analyzed using machine learning techniques (NLTK and YAKE) with Python. The results highlight that the SDGs have refocused the interests of academic and industrial stakeholders concerning MSWM, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The findings also show the cross-regional collaboration, including developing and developed countries, which places MSWM as a global issue. Furthermore, the intellectual growth and change over the period across academic and industrial fronts related to MSWM indicate that concerned stakeholders are actively participating in addressing concerns on social, economic, and environmental fronts. Finally, to offer the best solutions for society and the future world, efforts to minimize the gap and maximize the synchronization between academia and industry are necessary. The findings of this study can help elucidate the intellectual development of MSWM while keeping the SDGs at the forefront for academia and industry. Thus, the current study provides several policy implications for related stakeholders, such as policymakers and administrative authorities. As discussed above, developing countries are also engaged in integrating the SDGs on MSWM, which highlights their commitment. However, developed regions are still major contributors. As SDG17 emphasizes, "the SDGs can only be realized with strong global partnerships and cooperation." Recovery from COVID-19 requires stronger international cooperation to achieve the SDGs. It cannot be ignored that MSWM remains a global issue. Thus, the experience and lessons from developed regions can help avoid failures and economic losses. Developed countries should also enhance international hard (technology) and soft (capability building and financial assistance) aspects. To strengthen the role of SDG17 further, policy-level coordination and policy coherence related to MSWM at the global level should be discussed., It is, therefore, necessary to establish a high-quality, timely, and reliable data system that can address the MSWM life cycle and related processes globally. It can further help propose and implement policies and reforms to offer a sustainable and circular view in MSWM and build global accountability. Furthermore, the increasing collaborating trends between academia and industry in MSWM can be presented by the synchronization of theory (i.e., publications) and practice (i.e., patents). MSWM involves multiple research fronts and comprises several stages, including multistakeholder dynamics. The traditional bureaucracy regime is not the only choice for achieving sustainability in MSWM; other administrative views, that is, new public management and networked governance, can also be considered, as it is an effective way to encourage and promote public-private partnerships and civil society partnerships while addressing MSWM, which can facilitate the sharing of knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial resources. These findings offer policymakers sound and meaningful insights. As such, the sustainability-centric transition of MSWM is vital in the process of practicing and achieving the SDGs. This study took academic publications and patents as industrial-level markers of productivity from academia and industry, respectively. However, several patents have been filed by educational universities. This study deliberately examined a variety of patents, regardless of the inventor's source. Therefore, it can be suggested that future studies investigate patent growth performed by academia and industry. Moreover, alternate bibliometric sources (databases/repositories) of academic research publishers (i.e., Scopus) can also be considered in future research. Innovation, apart from the patents, also includes the service attributes, that is, how the MSWM operations and services have been performed, which could also be seen as part of the industrial-level contribution. Therefore, an alternative methodological approach, such as case-study-based research, could also be employed.
