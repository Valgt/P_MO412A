                  The need for sustainability and social responsibility investments is magnified as the world faces a significant loss of ecosystem function and biodiversity. Unfortunately, current assessment and decision-making support tools used to establish local sustainability priorities have limited efficacy. Thus, there is a critical need to design decision-making support tools and assessment models that appropriately fit a specific context. Essentially, they must be more effective in directing our investments in sustainability and social responsibility, both of which influence our future global economic growth.
                  The sustainable value mapping and analysis (SVMA) methodology, presented for the first time in this work, is a tool to engage multi-stakeholder groups in a strategic assessment of the social, environmental, and economic priorities and needs within supply chain operations. This paper introduces the SVMA methodology and applies it to two case studies, California almond growing and California winegrowing systems. The results point to the efficacy of the SVMA and opportunities to use it to develop and evaluate localized sustainability performance and outcomes against broader sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Keywords Sustainable development goals  Localization  Decision-making tools  Supply chain management    1 Introduction In recent decades, investment in sustainability and social responsibility has been part of global economic growth. These investments have occurred through various means, ranging from company-specific sustainability initiatives to international collaborative efforts like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2020 ). The SDGs provide a broad global framework to align sustainability efforts. However, a critical need to achieve the SDGs by 2030 will be the ability to effectively translate the goals, targets, and indicators of the broad framework into locally appropriate benchmarks and actions (Patole, 2018 ). More than ever, there is a wide range of options for organizations and companies with strategic approaches to benchmark their progress in achieving the SDGs. Unfortunately, the benchmarks and related sustainability reports developed by various entities can be misleading. Further, it is far from clear that the data included in sustainability reports are “aggregated and analyzed in ways that genuinely help decision- and policymakers to track, understand, and manage the systemic effects of human activity” (Elkington, 2018 ). In effect, investing in sustainability and social responsibility is not always based on real-world impacts nor appropriately fitted to specific, local contexts. It is imperative to identify “sustainable” goals representing the community and broader stakeholders’ shared values in sustainability relevant to local contexts. Local community involvement in stakeholder groups provides essential context-specific evidence (Agnew et al., 2006 ; Wahyudi and Jati, 2012 ) to adjust policy appropriately and manage the systemic effects of human activity. Products identified as “sustainable” in this way can also enhance the accountability for the social, environmental, and economic impacts and performance of production processes and specific products (e.g., Ozinga, 2004 ; von Hagen et al., 2010 ). The successful implementation of sustainability initiatives also requires capacity building (e.g., understanding obstacles, strengthening skills) across government, civil society, the private sector, indigenous peoples, and local communities (McLennan and Banks, 2019 ; IPCC, 2018 ) and at regional and global scales (Patole, 2018 ). Thus, we need to devise tools to help define and assess sustainability goals through stakeholder consensus inclusive of community shared values; and evaluate the outcomes of these efforts against broader SDGs. To achieve this goal, we developed the sustainable value mapping and analysis (SVMA) methodology. This paper defines the SVMA and evaluates it for two agri-food system case studies (i.e., the California winegrowing and California almond growing systems). The question is whether the SVMA can help establish multi-stakeholder shared values in local sustainability priorities and relate them to broader global sustainability goals (i.e., the SDGs).  2 Background Development of sustainability decision support tools initially emerged, in part, from widely adopted social responsibility concepts like corporate social responsibility (CSR), creating shared value (CSV), and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. CSR and CSV are often criticized for failing to embrace the perspective of community-based values and communities’ role in the long-term sustainability of systems (e.g., production and consumption processes and natural ecosystems) (McLennan and Banks, 2019 ; Lamb and Roundy, 2018 ). Yet, research shows it is imperative to have community-involvement in the stakeholder group, participating in the systematic approach to shared value assessment (Lock et al., 2016 ; Lock and Seele, 2017 ; Lamb and Roundy, 2018 ). Further, when implementing new initiatives or employing a framework for decision making, organizing bodies need to define the stakeholders, institutions, and cultural relevance of social responsibility activities; these factors change with time and are location-dependent (Porter and Kramer, 2006 ; Baric, 2017 ; Lock and Seele, 2017 ; Lamb and Roundy, 2018 ). Porter’s value chain model was one of the first frameworks or decision support tools for assessing value chain activities to create shared values for actors along the supply chain (Porter, 1985 ; Porter and Kramer, 2006 ; Porter and Kramer, 2011 ). Providing systematic mechanisms or frameworks by which multi-stakeholders can define shared values also helps create standards (e.g., a sustainability certification) (ISEAL, 2013 ). Extending Porter’s value chain model is not new. Several studies extend Porter’s value chain model. Tonelli et al. (2016)  integrated lean manufacturing with the value chain model with the aim to identify opportunities to reduce waste and economic impacts in manufacturing processes. Geissdoerfer et al. (2016)  integrated design thinking with the value chain model in a workshop format to include a broader set of stakeholders in assessing value chain activities. Chofreh et al. (2019)  extended the value chain model to help stakeholders identify challenges and potential opportunities to create sustainable water and sewage treatment systems. The methodology presented in this work, the SVMA, uses Porter’s value chain model as a conceptual basis and starting point to engage stakeholders in discussions about sustainable management activities and shared values. In the present study, we focus on activities at the production phase (on-farm) for two agri-food production systems. By applying the SVMA, a multi-stakeholder group contributes to defining and creating shared value in their local agri-food systems aligned with broader SDGs. To a limited extent, this study also evaluates the ability of the SVMA to support voluntary sustainability standards (or certifications).  3 Sustainable value mapping and analysis (SVMA) methodology The SVMA methodological approach emphasizes operational mapping using an adapted analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (Wallenius et al., 2008 ). It also uses operational mapping as a framework to define management practices and priorities in assessing local sustainability goals aligned with broader SDGs. It, therefore, can contribute to the localization of the SDGs. The primary stakeholders engaged through the SVMA methodology include community members, industry partners, and expert panels selected based on their agricultural production and sustainability science areas of expertise. For both case studies included in this work, the SVMA method is applied to a wide range of on-farm activities like pest management, tillage, and water management. The SVMA rates and ranks practices used to monitor impacts. The SVMA does not estimate impacts like greenhouse gas emissions, water quality scores, or air quality pollutant levels. 3.1 Methodology: stepwise approach The stepwise SVMA methodology includes 6 steps (Fig. 1    ). Step 1 is to identify the stakeholders. The stakeholders are identified using a participatory action research approach (e.g., Dlott et al., 1994 ; Méndez et al., 2017 ). In the present work, this approach is used to identify the primary stakeholders who are most directly affected by the select SVMA project (e.g., farmers and their immediate buyers such as wineries or almond handlers, followed by trade associations). Two main aims of this approach are to maintain the integrity of diverse perspectives (McLennan and Banks, 2019 ) and to recognize the importance of traditional or local knowledge of the agricultural production system(s) (Alzate et al., 2019 ) in combination with scientific knowledge.Step 2 – Develop high-level value propositions. The high-level value propositions are created through discussions with the primary stakeholders. The high-level value propositions include environmental, social, and economic goals linked to SDGs (e.g., Healthier Environment Life on Land).  Step 3 – Based on community-defined sustainability development goals (CDSDGs), create strategic value propositions, and sustainable management activities. The main objective of this step is to create strategic value propositions and practices aligned with the high-level value propositions. Creating strategic value propositions includes identifying some of the main drivers(s) of sustainability (e.g., reducing greenhouse gas emissions) to help form priority sustainability management areas. For each strategic value proposition, a sustainable management area and related practices are defined in Tables 1 and 2 .Step 4 – Define the indicator system. In this step, the indicator system is defined, including developing impact scores, score criteria, and decision logic for scoring the practices. Impact scores include a scaling system using 1, 3, or 5, where a ‘5′ indicates a high impact best management practice. This scaling system results in the greater perceived distance between practices (i.e., ‘1’ to ‘3’ rather than ‘1’ to ‘2’) when evaluating and discussing results. In part, this approach is based on prior experience and research conducted by Lubell et al. (2011) . This decision logic may take the format of a decision-tree. It may also include a ‘yes,’ ‘no,’ or ‘maybe’ type reasoning with qualifiers such as ‘yes, it is a critical factor to consider.’ The decision logic provides a way for individuals within a group to review a wide range of practices in a round-table discussion format or an electronic survey-based format for consensus-building purposes. The outcome of the process is a prioritized list of practices that are then reviewed in the next steps of the SVMA. Note that these round table discussions or an electronic review of this first list of practices typically happens in Step 5 of the SVMA.  Step 5 – Scoring. The application of the scoring system to the value propositions and practices (from Step 4) is carried out by engaging stakeholder groups in a series of round-table discussions wh or through virtual (or electronic) information exchanges. The purpose of this review process is to evaluate the high-level value propositions, strategic value propositions, sustainable management areas, and related practices.       In each case study, each practice was scored using pair-wise comparisons to decide if a practice was a best management practice (BMP) or a candidate for an industry-standard practice (ISP). For candidate IPSs, a subsequent pair-wise score was given to confirm the ISP or a low to no value practice. Experts were trained on the decision logic to address the consistency and validity of the pair-wise decisions, including post-assessment comparisons of the same set of practices. Stakeholder round-table meetings or virtual exchanges also included training and calibration sessions. In some cases, two or more subcategory practices can be included within a practice category. In this case, the impact scores can be applied to sub-categorical practices. For example, for the practice category “water supply management,” a possible sub-categorical practice is “total water use monitored.” The option to add the sub-categorical operations in the assessment tool enables practitioners (e.g., a producer) to continue to improve in meeting their sustainability goals within a broader category (e.g., water supply management). In other words, the subcategories are designed to provide actionable items to support incremental improvement toward sustainability goals. This approach is also useful for sustainable certification programs. Finally, Step 6 includes data analysis. The values applied to practices in Step 5 are summed and ranked, from low to high values, to help prioritize the practices within sustainable management areas, strategic value propositions, and high-level value propositions. The data collected through the 6-step process is unique between commodities and stakeholder groups and therefore varies for each of the case studies evaluated in this study.  3.2 Case study descriptions The case studies selected for this study include almond growing and winegrowing. These are two of the main agricultural industries in California. As of the most recent California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) data, almond is the top crop in CA by acreage (wine/grapes are #2), and winegrape is the leading crop by value (and almonds are #2) (excluding dairy and hay/alfalfa) (CDFA, 2018 ). In part, the SVMA was developed in partnership with these industries based on their expressed need to invest in data-driven continuous improvement approaches toward sustainable on-farm practices considering scientific evidence on best practices, multiple stakeholders’ values, and broader implications of localized agricultural production and product-level sustainability goals. 3.2.1 Case study one: California winegrowing The primary stakeholders include the California winegrape and vintner associations, California winegrape growers, and winemakers. The expert panel consists of a team of the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance (CSWA), SureHarvest staff, and a joint review committee, including more than 90 growers and vintner members of Wine Institute and California Association of Winegrape Growers. SureHarvest is a California-based organization that offers third-party verification and certification services and aims to drive food and agriculture system sustainability. The CSWA is a San Francisco-based 501(c)3 non-profit organization incorporated in 2003 by the Wine Institute and the California Association of Winegrape Growers to enhance sustainable winegrowing practices (California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance, 2020a ). The CSWA and the joint review committee oversaw and provided technical input into the California Code of Sustainable Winegrowing Workbook, a tool for growers and vintners to measure their level of sustainability by assessing their practices and learning about ways they can improve. Initially released in 2002, the second edition of the Workbook was issued in late 2006, and the 3rd edition was published in January 2013 (California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance, 2020b ). A 4th edition is pending publication. The Workbook addresses environmental, economic, and social equity criteria through an integrated set of 15 chapters and 191 criteria. Reporting includes a built-in system with metrics to measure performance. This Workbook is the source of sustainable management areas and related practices generated in Step 3 of the SVMA. The Workbook also serves as the standard for the Certified California Sustainable Winegrowing (CCSW) program, which was introduced in 2010 (CSWA, 2020c ). The certification program is administered by CSWA and includes third-party verification of wineries and vineyards according to practices in the Workbook. The SVMA, Steps 2–6 were carried out through round table discussions with key stakeholders with PowerPoint guided key discussion areas, including the background to the SVMA approach (e.g., the concept of shared value). These discussions resulted in a draft of high-level value propositions (Step 2) and the refinement of the strategic value propositions, sustainable management areas, and related practices (Step 3). Additional in-person round table discussions were held to facilitate continuous review and exchange of information, including real-time review and revisions for each step in the value mapping and analysis process, including reaching consensus on the value map and scores. The sustainable winegrowing expert panel generated the initial drafts of the impact scores, scoring criteria, and decision logic, created in Step 4, and then reviewed and revised it with the joint committee. The final round-table discussions consisted of applying the indicator system to the value propositions and practices (in Step 5). The sustainable winegrowing expert panel generated the initial drafts of the aggregated results, created in Step 6, and then reviewed and revised them with the joint committee. Implementation of the SVMA for winegrowing started in January 2015. The final report was completed in August 2015.  3.2.2 Case study two: California almond growing For the almond growing case, the primary stakeholders include California almond growers and handlers and the Almond Board of California and Environmental Committee. The Almond Board of California and Environmental Committee comprises almond growers, handlers, pest control advisors, neighbors, and crop production specialists. The stakeholder group expanded over the years to include, for example, consumers. The expert panel was comprised of SureHarvest staff. The Almond Board of California is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, established in 1950. It is based in Modesto, California. It administers a grower-enacted Federal Marketing Order under the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Almond Board of California, 2020 ). The Almond Board of California Environment Committee recommended creating the California Almond Sustainability Program (CASP) approved and funded by the Almond Board of California Board of Directors starting in 2009. CASP currently includes nine topic-specific almond production sustainability modules with more than 500 practices (modules have been added over time). CASP modules are the source of sustainable management areas and related practices generated in Step 3 of the SVMA for this case study. The SVMA methodology, Steps 2–6 were run through a platform of information exchange for almonds following a similar approach to the winegrowing example. SureHarvest staff facilitated a series of in-person meetings with the Environmental Committee and the Almond Board of California staff to discuss the SVMA approach. Outcomes from these discussions included the high-level and strategic value propositions, sustainable management areas and related practices, impact scores, score criteria, decision logic for practices (created in Steps 2 through 5). The final product created in Step 6 is the SVMA aggregated results for the value propositions and priority sustainable management areas and practices. Implementation of the SVMA for almond growing started in August 2013, and the final report was completed in January 2014.   3.3 Data and data structures 3.3.1 California winegrowing The winegrowing case study data includes winery and vineyard data for 2012–2019 and 2013–2015 SVMA results. Some of the strategic value propositions and practice unique names changed over time from the initial assessment data (2013–2015) to the more recent winery and vineyard data (i.e., in 2018/2019). These changes are mainly due to gained awareness of redundancy between practices. Also, there is a non-uniform number of samples available from year to year in the winery and vineyard data, depending on the number of participants (i.e., growers) in the sample pool for a given year. Only the complete 2018, one-year data (January 1 to December 31, 2018) is used for this evaluation.  3.3.2 California almond growing The almond growing case study data includes almond grower data (i.e., the CASP data) for 2009–2019 and 2014/2015 SVMA results. The data includesa non-uniform number of samples from year to year, depending on the number of participants (i.e., growers) in the sample pool for a given year. CASP data is collected according to crop year, which is retrospective and runs from November 1 to October 31. The most recently completed assessment year is the 2018 Crop Year, and those assessments were completed from November 1, 2018, to October 31, 2019. The complete 2018, one-year data is used for the evaluation of the SVMA applied to almond growing.   3.4 Data analysis and visualizations The data were stored in relational databases and then extracted to MS Excel files for analysis. The data were processed and analyzed using a series of basic Microsoft Excel functions and R Studio packages (e.g., dplyr packages). Visualizations were created in ggplot2. 3.4.1 California winegrowing The line plots show the responses from growers (e.g., vineyards) ranked categorically (on a scale of 1–4, where a ‘4’ represents best management practice) relative to the practices in each sustainable management area (results shown in Appendix A1 ). Table 1  shows the sustainable management areas linked to the strategic value propositions, the high-level value propositions, and example SDGs. The endpoints on the lines represent the 25th and 75th percentiles for the stakeholders’ responses, and the point represents the arithmetic mean (Appendix A1 ). Heat maps visualize relational data between the high-level value propositions and sustainable management areas linked to the strategic value propositions and scores for the practices (1, 3, 5) (Appendix B1 ). A summary table (Table 3  ) is used to combine information from the grower responses presented in the heat maps and the expert panel responses given in the line plots. This table shows the relationship between the expert panel strategic value propositions and scores for the practices (1, 3, 5) from the heat maps and grower community practices categorical rankings from the line plots (on a scale of 1–4). In this table, for each sustainable management area (e.g., pest management), each practice is evaluated to identify expert ranked practice scores (3, 5) and community ranked practice scores (3, 4). We assume practices the community members invest effort in improving that receive a score of ‘4′ or ‘3’ are of the highest priority or highest value to the community member.  3.4.2 California almond growing The grower community responses are ranked categorically as ‘No,’ ‘Not applicable,’ and ‘Yes’ for each practice in each sustainable management area (Appendix A2 ). Table 2  shows the sustainable management areas linked to the strategic value propositions, the high-level value propositions, and example SDGs. The ‘Yes’ indicates the grower did use the defined practice, ‘No’ means the grower did not use the practice, and ‘Not applicable’ means the practice does not apply to their production system. Heat maps are used to visualize the high-level value propositions (e.g., environmental value) and sustainable management areas linked to the strategic value propositions and expert panel scores applied to the practices (Appendix B2 ). A summary table (Table 4  ) combines information from the grower responses and the expert panel responses. In this table, for each sustainable management area (e.g., pest management), we present the expert ranked high ranking practices (3, 5) and community ‘Yes’ responses. We assume practices the community members invest effort in improving or maintaining (i.e., the ’Yes’ responses) are of the highest priority and highest value to the community. Also, in the almond growing case study, the SVMA was used to identify and prioritize practices that enhance its brand. The two score criteria included in the evaluation of enhancing brand include ‘sustain high-quality or improve quality’ and ‘consistency and communicate sustainability accomplishments.’ Each of these categories’ maximum score is a ‘5.’    4 Results 4.1 California winegrowing results The results provide value ranking for experts (1, 3, 5) and community members (i.e., vineyard producers) (average categorical scale based on the range of values, 1–4, presented by vineyard growers) for each sustainability management area (Appendices A1  and B1, and Table 3 ). The summary table shows the highly shared values (ranked 3.2 and above in the community and a total ranking of higher than 10 by the expert panel) and the challenge areas (Table 3 ). The shared values in sustainable winegrowing management include herbicide leaching potential, ecosystem management for aquatic habitats, nitrogen management, surface water diversions for erodible sites, and pest management (Table 3 ). A handful of practices are considered a priority by vineyard producers (i.e., they received a higher ranking than 3.2) but experts rank as less than a total of a ‘10.’ These include all the practices within the sustainable management areas of wine quality, viticulture, neighbors, and community (Appendices A1  and B1). A challenge area is defined as a practice a community member scores below a ‘3.2,’ but the expert panel scores as ‘10’ or above. In other words, the expert panel ranks the practice (or activity) as a high priority in reaching sustainability goals, but the community members ranks it as a low priority. Based on the current study results, these include water budget, weed management, agricultural burning, and non-point source (NPS) pollution prevention vineyard block (Table 3 ). Overall, of the thirteen sustainable management areas in the SVMA for winegrowing, vineyard producers mainly invest in five areas. These areas include neighborhood and community, viticulture, wine quality, pest management, and soil management (Appendix A1 ). For each of these sustainable management areas, 50% or more of the practices are ranked as a ‘3’ and above by the community. For the following three sustainable management areas, all practices within the management area have community rankings less than a ‘3’: energy efficiency, material handling, and environmentally preferable purchasing. Eight (of the 13) sustainable management areas show no highly shared values between the community and expert panel: energy efficiency, viticulture, wine quality, human resources, neighborhoods and community, sustainable business strategy, materials handling, and environmentally preferable purchasing (Table 3 ). The community and expert panel consider the ‘environmentally preferable purchasing’ sustainable management area a low priority.  4.2 California almond growing results The results provide grower community practice responses (‘No,’ ‘Yes,’ or ‘Not Applicable’) (Appendix A2 ) and expert panel rankings (−1, 0, 1, 3, 5) (Appendix B2 ) for the sustainability areas and related practices. The summary table shows the highly shared values (ranked ‘Yes’ by the community and a total ranking higher than 10 by the expert panel) and the challenge areas (ranked as ‘No’ in the community and a ranking of 10 by the expert panel) (Table 4 ). The shared values in almond growing sustainable management include fertilizer-efficient and irrigation-efficient practices used together, comprehensive nitrogen management plan and budget, rootstocks selection, and groundwater protection against contamination (Table 4 ). There are a handful of practices highly ranked by the almond grower community that have a total ranking of less than ‘10’ by experts, including on-site solar energy used to generate electricity or heat (e.g., hot water or processing heat) (Appendices A2  and B2). The expert rankings for social values were highest for the air quality sustainable management area. Based on the results of this study, almond growers invest equally in all five of these sustainable management categories: air quality, energy efficiency, irrigation management, nutrient and soil management, and pest management (Appendix A2 ). For each of these sustainable management areas, 49 or 50% or more of the practices have grower community rankings of a ‘Yes.’ For the enhanced brand proposition, the highest-ranking practices (total rankings ‘8’ or higher) include variable-rate fertilizer applications and irrigation efficiency to maintain desired nitrogen in the root zone and reduce losses from nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions, nitrate leaching, and runoff (Appendix A2 ). These practices are presented in the SVMA based on the two scored criteria included in evaluating and enhancing the brand category (i.e., sustaining high-quality or improving quality and consistency and communicate sustainability accomplishments).   5 Discussion 5.1 Managerial implications and future research: shared values and challenge areas in California winegrowing and almond growing 5.1.1 California winegrowing The SVMA highlights the following sustainable management areas that are challenge areas for winegrowing: soil management, air quality, and water management (Table 3 ). These results present a range of potential managerial implications. Stakeholders, including community members, can invest (e.g., in education and awareness or incentive programs) in these areas to improve the performance of the activities or value to help meet broader sustainability goals. Based on the SVMA results, this study reveals some compartmentalization or perceived compartmentalization of the practices within the sustainability management areas. Meaning the interactions between practices are not considered. Therefore, the values placed on a specific practice or activity may not reflect the most effective management option(s) to meet multiple sustainable management goals. For example, highly shared values in water management include off-site water movement. However, within the same sustainable management area (i.e., water management), developing a water budget and water management strategy is a challenge area (Table 3 ). It cannot be overstated that systematically managing resources with an understanding of the interconnections within the system is essential. The SVMA and other tools that intend to address localizing the SDGs need to consider individual activities, interactions, and feedback between activities.  5.1.2 California almond growing Based on the results of this study, the SVMA highlights the following priority sustainable management areas that are challenge areas for almond growing: nutrient (e.g., nitrogen), water, and energy management practices used together to reduce overall environmental impacts (Table 4 ). Like the winegrowing case study, the almond growing case study indicates that there may be a perceived compartmentalization of practices and a limited amount of consideration regarding the interactions between activities. Again, the importance of systematically managing production systems considering feedbacks within the system cannot be overstated. For instance, uFor instance, using less water, nutrients, and energy resources per unit almond produced can significantly affect the overall environmental effects of the almond production operations (e.g., Winans et al., 2020 ). In the almond growing case, the SVMA results were used to improve management options as part of the ongoing Almond Board of California sustainability efforts. Specifically, the SVMA results were used to update the CASP nine topic-specific almond production sustainability modules. As such, the managerial implications of the study results are realized through the CASP ‘translation tool’ that plays a role in the sustainability conversations between almond-specific sustainability efforts (e.g., CASP) and global sustainability definitions (e.g., SDGs), and actors along the supply chain (e.g., retailers). This dialogue supports the industry’s capacity to respond to consumer (or investor) demand on sustainability issues.   5.2 Opportunities and limitations The SVMA aggregated results (or value map) include a prioritized list of high-level value and strategic value propositions, sustainable management areas, and related practices that narrowly represent localized sustainability goals. We use the community members’ assessment of the practices and their CDSDGs as critical feedback in an iterative process to inform localized SDGs. Future research options include identifying the motivations or drivers of values assigned to practices and related management areas. Improvements to the SVMA include standardizing the numerical approach for the scoring system. Overall, a standardized process for the baseline SVMA methodology (i.e., the 6-Steps) will enable flexibility in the method for comparison across studies (e.g., winegrowing and almond growing) and with the SDGs. Recent surveys have suggested that progress is being made towards the SDGs. Further research and projects are recommended to employ the SVMA as outlined in this paper to support tailoring and prioritizing the SDGs’ targets and indicators (GlobeScan-SustainAbility Survey, 2019 ). Using the SVMA framework as a tool for localization of the SDGs will provide context for the practice improvements that impact local systems that ultimately drive the sustainability of global systems. Specifically, this alignment can enable the SVMA to function as a support tool for regional system sustainability linked with global impacts of ecosystems (e.g., biodiversity), responsible consumption and production (e.g., material and product footprint), climate actions (reduction of GHGs and improved human health), and decent work and economic growth (e.g., sustainable tourism, green economy, employment, and human health). Also, we recommend adding flexibility to include more rigorous quantitative assessments (e.g., life-cycle assessment (LCA)) and results. Integrating the SVMA with a standardized LCA framework (e.g., define the goal(s) and scope, inventory analysis, etc.) can generate useful information—that can provide critical insights for the SVMA. For example, defining the system boundary is in itself an educational process. This effort can help provide clear boundaries for the extent of the production system boundary concerning the rest of the supply chain.   6 Conclusions This paper defines the SVMA and evaluates it for two agri-food system case studies (i.e., the California winegrowing and California almond growing). This study establishes that the SVMA helps multi-stakeholders determine shared values in local sustainability priorities, linked with the SDGs. To a limited extent, this study also evaluates the ability of the SVMA to support sustainable certifications considering that one of the case studies represents a sustainability certification program. Overall, the SVMA methodology presented in this work enables a vital opportunity to re-engage stakeholders, including local communities. It does not provide a way to link sustainability drivers to responsible investing for developing effective, sustainable decisions. Identifying the drivers of stakeholders’ decisions regarding practices or activities assessed using the SVMA needs to be incorporated into the methodology. Further, standardization of the numerical scoring system will help assess and compare product-level and supply chain sustainability performance and outcomes. Despite these limitations, we conclude that the SVMA is an effective method for multi-stakeholder groups to assess activities at a specific production phase (on-farm) to see how those activities contribute to creating shared value in sustainable agri-food systems. As demonstrated through case studies of California almond growing and winegrowing, the SVMA has helped create locally relevant sustainability programs with widespread adoption. The SVMA could be used in a similar way to support the localization of broader sustainability frameworks such as the SDGs.  CRediT authorship contribution statement K.
