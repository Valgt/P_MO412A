                  This study investigates the pivotal role of remittances in advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within developing countries. While previous literature has acknowledged the potential of remittances in fostering growth, empirical analyses on their impact on SDGs remain scant. Utilizing data from 109 developing countries spanning 2000 to 2022 and employing system GMM and the Lewbel's (2012) estimator to tackle endogeneity issues, we unveil significant positive effects of remittances on SDGs. Additionally, we identify financial inclusion as a mediating factor enhancing remittances' impacts on SDGs. Moreover, we show that remittances, international aid, and government spending exhibit complementary roles in SDGs attainment.

Another initiative from the World Bank, namely The World Bank's Global Partnership on Financial Inclusion (GPFI) attempts to promote financial inclusion for all, including remittance receivers. The GPFI supports a variety of programs that help increasing access to financial services for low-income people. Finally, The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) supports smallholder farmers in developing countries using remittances funds.

This study investigates the pivotal role of remittances in advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within developing countries. While previous literature has acknowledged the potential of remittances in fostering growth, empirical analyses on their impact on SDGs remain scant. Utilizing data from 109 developing countries spanning 2000 to 2022 and employing system GMM and the Lewbel's (2012) estimator to tackle endogeneity issues, we unveil significant positive effects of remittances on SDGs. Additionally, we identify financial inclusion as a mediating factor enhancing remittances' impacts on SDGs. Moreover, we show that remittances, international aid, and government spending exhibit complementary roles in SDGs attainment.

While rich countries often managed to stimulate recovery and mitigate the impact of various setbacks, developing countries encountered serious challenges to meet their growing needs with not enough resources. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), developing countries would require a minimum of USD 3.9 trillion by 2030 to attain their targeted sustainable development goals,1  1 The full list of SDGs is reported in Table A1  in the Appendix.   possibly reaching USD 4.3 trillion as projected by the UN Conference on Trade and Development. The recent COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated these needs due to lower internal government tax revenues and reduced external financing through foreign direct investment and remittances (World Bank, 2021 ). Moreover, even before the COVID-19 crisis, and despite some gradual convergence, progress towards the 2030 SDGs agenda had already shifted from its intended track (UN, 2023 ; OECD, 2023 ). Developing countries have achieved milestones in critical domains such as poverty alleviation, maternal and child healthcare, electricity access, and gender parity. However, the advancements in other vital areas, including reducing inequality, promoting peace and justice, curbing carbon emissions, reducing maternal mortality, preserving biodiversity, and combating hunger, were either sluggish or had regressed (Pattberg & Bäckstrand, 2023 ). For instance, the global number of undernourished individuals experienced a 7% increase, with an additional 43 million people falling into this category between 2014 and 2019. Moreover, progress in achieving justice and peace (SDG 16) has significantly slowed down, as highlighted by the latest UN report in 2023. As a result, the United Nations has emphasized the urgent need for immediate actions (UN, 2023 , p. 2023). Progress in SGD 4, which aims to guarantee quality education, also faced severe obstacles. Indeed, estimates suggest that the emphasis on providing more resources to healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic may result in around 84 million children and adolescents being deprived of access to education by 2030 due to funding shortages (Pattberg & Bäckstrand, 2023 ; UN, 2023). Amidst this backdrop, remittances emerge as a viable tool for economic growth to overcome the scarcity of resources in many developing countries, usually surpassing Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). This potential solution is of utmost importance, especially given the increased economic unpredictability (Barkat et al., 2023 ). Interestingly, despite a slight 1% decline in remittances to developing countries between 2019 and 2020, dropping from USD 504 billion to USD 499 billion (OECD, 2023 ), their resilience to numerous crises has been instrumental in maintaining investments related to consumption and shielding vulnerable populations from extreme poverty. These private funds assist families in reducing poverty, improving health and nutrition, accessing quality education, enhancing housing and sanitation, and navigating life's uncertainties through larger savings and better asset-building. Because these goals are the essence of several SDGs, remittances can significantly contribute to their achievement at the micro and macro levels. At the micro level, remittances positively impact socio-economic conditions of households, improving family welfare (Adams Jr and Page, 2005 ; Azizi, 2018 ; Barkat et al., 2023 ; Tsafack & Djeunankan, 2021 ), which aligns with SDGs 1 to 5. At the country's level, remittances can help in implementing policies and measures that enhance financial inclusion, promote market competition, support regulatory reforms, and mitigate potential climate changes (Deonanan & Williams, 2017 ; Musah-Surugu and Anuga. 2023 ; Couharde et al., 2011 ). This is in line with SDGs 6 to 13. Finally, at the global level, the revitalized Global Partnership for Sustainable Development (SDG 17) and the Global Compact on Migration should encourage cross-sector collaboration in remittances, fostering international cooperation to achieve these goals (UN, 2023). While remittances offer significant benefits, it is important to recognize their potential negative impacts on the economy, hindering the progress towards the SDGs. For instance, remittances may significantly increase recipients’ wealth, leading to a shortage in labor supply due to reduced work incentives, thereby slowing down economic growth (Rodriguez and Tiongson, 2001; Chami et al., 2018 ). Remittances can also trigger the Dutch disease effects by appreciating the real exchange rate, shifting resources from the tradeable sector to non-tradeable sector, potentially harming long-term economic expansion (Chami et al., 2008 ). Moreover, remittances can present moral hazard issues by decreasing political will for policy reforms and delaying crucial public infrastructure upgrades (Chami et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, some empirical works suggest that a surge in international remittances may negatively impact the environment by encouraging the consumption and production of energy-intensive goods, posing challenges to achieving several SDGs (Dash et al., 2024 ). It is important to note that the effectiveness of remittances in achieving the SDGs depends on the existence of well-established financial services infrastructures as they provide individuals and families with access to banking, savings, credit, and insurance. This enhanced financial inclusion through remittances contributes directly to improving multiple SDGs, including SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), and SDG 4 (Quality education). It also boosts economic productivity, supporting SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), and helps reduce inequality (SDG 10) promoting equitable economic participation. A sophisticated financial services infrastructure supporting mobile banking and digital wallets can reach underserved populations (Tay et al., 2022 ). Hence, the more sophisticated the financial services are, the more likely and swiftly the SDGs can be achieved. Accordingly, financial inclusion serves as an important mediator in the relationship between remittances and SDGs performance. This study aims to examine the extent of this mediating effect. Overall, our study sheds light on the role played by international remittances in the achievement of the SDGs and offers practical recommendations into how this transformation can be realized. In doing so, this research makes several significant contributions to the existing literature. First and foremost, it empirically analyzes the impact of remittances on SDGs attainment using a large panel dataset including 109 developing countries over the period from 2000 to 2022. Second, this study examines the influence of remittances on each individual SDG. Specifically, it assesses the impact of remittances not only on the overall global SDGs performance score, but also on each stand-alone SDG. This approach allows us to provide a detialed understanding of the effects of remittances across the diverse spectrum of SDGs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study attempting to address this issue empirically. Furthermore, given the diversity within the sample under investigation, the estimations are performed by considering the specificities of each region (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) and income group (low, lower-middle, and upper middle-income countries). This stratified analysis will enrich the policy implications of our findings. Third, our study explores how remittances affect SDGs achievement by introducing financial inclusion as a mediating variable. To this end, a novel comprehensive financial inclusion index is constructed by employing a two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) method. The findings of our study reveal that financial inclusion serves as a crucial channel through which remittances contribute to achieving the SDGs. Indeed, by granting access to formal financial services, remittances help recipients to alleviate poverty, reduce inequalities, stimulate economic growth, promote gender equality, support education, enhance healthcare access, and facilitate climate-resilient initiatives. Thus, financial inclusion amplifies the positive impacts of remittances on various SDGs, fostering well-being and sustainable development in developing countries. Fourth, our study investigates the combined effect of government funding, Official Development Assistance (ODA), and remittances on achieving SDGs. This is achieved by exploring the interaction between these funding sources and their influence on SDGs. This provides valuable perspectives into the importance of government investment and foreign aid in supporting the role of remittances. Our study employs a range of robust econometric techniques, including fixed and random effects as benchmark estimations, as well as the system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and Lewbel's (2012) estimator to address potential endogeneity concerns. Moreover, a two-staged estimation approach is implemented to thoroughly investigate whether financial inclusion is a potential mediating channel through which remittances influence SDGs achievement. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2  highlights the different mechanisms through which remittances affect SDGs achievements and discusses the existing literature. Section 3  presents the model, methodology, and data used in this study. Section 4  discusses the results. Finally, Section 5  concludes and provides policy recommendations.  2 The impact of remittances on SDGs achievement: theoretical framework and literature review  2.1 Effect of remittances on SDG 1: Poverty reduction Remittances are a powerful tool in the fight against poverty (Adams Jr & Page, 2005 ). They directly impact SDG 1 by providing financial resources to recipient households. When individuals or families receive remittances from relatives working abroad, they often experience an increase in their disposable income. This additional income can help lift recipient households above the poverty line, reducing their vulnerability to extreme poverty. Remittances can also contribute to the diversification of income sources in recipient communities through asset-building. For example, families can invest remittances in income-generating activities, such as starting small businesses or agricultural ventures (Massey & Parrado, 1998 ). This economic empowerment helps reducing the reliance on subsistence farming and informal labor. Several empirical studies have shown the positive impact of remittance on poverty reduction in developing countries. For instance, Adams Jr and Page (2005)  conducted a study in which they analyzed the influence of remittances on poverty in 71 developing countries. Their main finding indicates that, on average, a 10% rise in per capita remittances in a developing country result in a 3.5% reduction in the proportion of people living in poverty. Another empirical study by Acosta et al. (2008)  suggests that international remittances have a positive, albeit modest impact on poverty in Latin America. On average, each 1% increase in remittances is associated with a 0.4% decrease in poverty in Latin America. Additionally, various studies conducted at country levels such as Taylor, Mora, Adams, and Lopez-Feldman (2008)  in Mexico, Lokshin et al. (2010)  in Nepal, and Adams (2006)  in Ghana, using household survey data, support the findings according to which international migration and remittances contribute to poverty reduction. In contrast, another body of empirical research indicates that remittances may not necessarily reduce poverty in developing countries. For example, De la Fuente (2010) , utilizing panel data from rural households in Mexico, found that remittances may rise the risk of future poverty among Mexican rural populations. Similarly, a study by Nguyen Viet (2008)  on Vietnam revealed that remittances have a negligible impact on reducing poverty for recipient families.  2.2 Effect of remittances on SDG 2: Zero Hunger Remittances can enhance food security by increasing household income, reducing food poverty, and improving dietary diversity (Mabrouk & Mekni, 2018 ; Sulemana et al., 2019 , 2023 ). Families with increased purchasing power for nutritious food are less likely to experience hunger and malnutrition. Several studies investigated the role of remittances in securing food security in developing countries, especially in Africa. For instance, Mabrouk and Mekni (2018)  investigate the relationship between remittances and food security using panel data of Africain countries during the 1990–2013 period. Their main findings show that remittances play an important role in enhancing food security in this region. In the same vein, Sulemana et al. (2019)  used data for over 48,000 people in 32 sub-Saharan African countries. They found a positive and highly significant relationship between remittances and household food security. Additionally, their results reveal that the frequency of receiving remittances is the most important determinant in this relationship. Sulemana et al. (2023)  investigated the influence of remittances on food security across three income groups in Africa. Their findings revealed that, in low-income countries, households receiving remittances were 83.59% more likely to report that they had never experienced food scarcity. In lower-middle income countries, this likelihood was 72.66% higher, and in upper-middle income countries, the likelihood increased by 26.06%. Moreover, remittances can also boost agricultural productivity as some households receiving remittances invest these funds in agricultural activities. This investment can take various forms, such as the purchase of seeds, tools, livestock, or fertilizers (Li et al., 2013 ; Rozelle et al., 1999 ). Such investments can lead to substantial increases in agricultural productivity (Li et al., 2013 ; Rozelle et al., 1999 ).  2.3 Effect of remittances on SDG 3: Good health and well-being Enhancing access to healthcare services represents a direct avenue through which remittances can positively impact health. Families can allocate remittances to cover medical expenses, including doctor's visits, hospital stays, and medication costs. Moreover, remittances offer the opportunity to invest in health insurance, providing a financial safety net against unforeseen medical problems. Additionally, the influence of remittances extends to promoting child health by augmenting maternal health knowledge (Adams, 2011 ). Empirical studies consistently demonstrate that households receiving remittances exhibit superior health outcomes compared to those without such financial support. For instance, Azizi (2018)  found that remittances positively affect health expenditures while reducing malnutrition and child mortality rates. Duryea et al.’s (2005)  investigation, based on Mexican population census data, revealed a significant decrease in infant mortality rates linked to international remittances, particularly in large urban areas. The study also identified improvements in living conditions, such as access to tap water and the acquisition of appliances, as primary contributors to the decline in infant mortality. Moreover, remittances play a role in disease prevention, as families can utilize these funds to acquire essential items like mosquito nets, vaccines, and hygiene products, aiding in the fight against infectious diseases and fostering healthier living conditions (Amuedo-Dorantes & Pozo, 2011 ; Yang & Choi, 2007 ).  2.4 Effect of remittances on SDG 4: Quality education Remittances may play a pivotal role in funding education, as families utilize the income to cover school fees, acquire educational materials, and invest in private tutoring when necessary. This increased financial support, facilitated by remittances, contributes to enhancing access to quality education for children within recipient households. Moreover, remittances allow individuals to pursue higher education or vocational training, resulting in enhanced skills and employability. This aligns with the objectives of SDG 4, which strives to ensure inclusive, equitable, and quality education, promoting opportunities for lifelong learning. Empirical studies consistently confirm the positive impact of remittances on education in developing countries. For instance, Azizi (2018)  used a vast panel dataset comprising 122 developing countries and demonstrated that international remittances positively influence school enrollment, completion rates, and private school enrollment. At the national level, Lopez-Cordova (2018)  utilized data from all Mexican municipalities in 2000 to unveil that an increased proportion of households receiving international remittances leads to a reduction in illiteracy rates among children aged 6 to 14. In contrast, attendance among teenagers aged 15 to 17 experienced a significant decrease, suggesting a potential disincentive effect on investing in the education of older children. Similarly, Edwards and Ureta (2003) , using nationally representative household survey data from El Salvador, found that remittances significantly increase school attendance and, in urban areas, reduce the risk of a child dropping out of elementary school by 54%. In contrast, other research suggests that remittances can negatively affect human capital. A study by Alcaraz et al. (2012)  investigated the influence of remittances on school attendance among Mexican migrant families between 2008 and 2009. Their main findings indicated that remittances adversely impacted school attendance and contributed instead to an increase in child labor.  2.5 Effect of remittances on SDG 5: gender equality Beyond the direct financial benefits of remittances, these private inflows are linked to improved gender equality (Ratha, 2013 ). For example, women receiving remittances often experience increased decision-making authority within their families and communities, thereby contributing to the advancement of gender equality. Additionally, families frequently allocate remittances to support women's education and entrepreneurial endeavors, facilitating the acquisition of valuable skills, access to economic opportunities, and the challenging of traditional gender roles. There is a scarcity of empirical studies on the impact of remittances on gender equality, and the results are mixed. Sambo's (2016)  examination of 21 African countries spanning 2006–2014 revealed a positive influence of remittances on women's economic and political empowerment. In contrast, Soedarwo et al. (2023) , studying Indonesian workers' remittances, found that while remittances significantly contribute to social welfare, their impact on gender equality and political participation is insignificant.  2.6 Impact of remittances on SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation Remittances can contribute to investments in infrastructure, particularly in the development of clean water and sanitation facilities. Families have the opportunity to utilize remittance income for enhancing water sources, constructing latrines, or investing in wastewater treatment, aligning with the objectives of SDG 6 (Akanle et al., 2022 ). The higher income derived from remittances enables families to secure access to clean and safe drinking water, which reduces the prevalence of waterborne diseases and enhances the overall health and well-being. Investigating the impact of remittances on access to safe drinking water and sanitation in 116 developing countries from 2000 to 2017, Tsafack and Djeunankan (2021)  found a positive causality between remittances and access to these essential services for the entire sample, containing both urban and rural subgroups. Furthermore, the authors highlight the crucial role played by remittances in bridging the urban-rural gap in terms of access to these services.  2.7 Impact of remittances on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy Remittances play a pivotal role in fostering the adoption of clean and sustainable energy technologies, as families channel these funds into investments such as solar panels, efficient cooking stoves, and other renewable energy solutions. This proactive engagement contributes significantly to the achievement of SDG 7 (Agradi, 2023 ; Barkat et al., 2023 ; Hosan et al., 2023 ). When supported by remittances, households can transition away from the use of polluting fuels for cooking and heating, resulting in reduced levels of indoor air pollution and a corresponding decrease in associated health risks. Empirical studies consistently show the positive and substantial impact of remittances on alleviating energy poverty in developing countries, aligning with the objectives of SDG target 7.1, which seeks to ensure affordable, reliable, and modern energy services for all. Barkat et al. (2023)  examined 109 developing countries from 2000 to 2019 and found that remittances can effectively mitigate energy poverty in low and middle-income countries. The study identifies income poverty, human development, institutional quality, and income inequality as important mediating channels through which remittances influence energy poverty. Similarly, Agradi (2023)  investigates the short-run and long-run effects of remittances on energy poverty in 51 African countries from 1991 to 2017, concluding that remittances do indeed alleviate energy poverty in Africa. Specifically, their findings indicate that a 1% increase in remittances is associated with a 0.5–0.8% increase in electricity consumption. On a country-specific level, Wijayarathne et al. (2022)  and Hosan et al. (2023)  demonstrate that remittance inflows significantly mitigate energy poverty in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, respectively.  2.8 Impact of remittances on SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth Remittances have the potential to indirectly foster job creation and stimulate economic growth within recipient communities. When directed towards local businesses or entrepreneurial initiatives, remittance funds can boost economic activity, leading to an expansion of employment opportunities. Families may choose to invest remittances in vocational training, ultimately enhancing employability, fostering entrepreneurship, and promoting sustained economic growth. However, the empirical literature presents inconclusive findings regarding the impact of remittances on economic growth in developing countries. Some studies posit a positive effect, attributing it to the stimulation of consumption, investment, and savings (Glytsos, 2005; Meyer and Shera, 2017). In contrast, other research suggests a negative relationship between remittances and economic growth, particularly when these funds are predominantly directed towards consumption rather than productive investments (Adams & Klobodu, 2016 ; Ahamada & Coulibaly, 2013 ; Barajas et al., 2009 ; Chami et al., 2005 ).  2.9 Impact of remittances on SDG 10: reduced inequality Remittances possess the potential to alleviate income inequality within and among countries. When flowing from urban to rural areas or from more developed countries to less developed ones, these remittances spark economic development in regions that might otherwise remain marginalized, addressing spatial inequality. However, the empirical impact of remittances on income inequality remains a topic of debate in the literature and lacks clarity. On the national scale, numerous studies suggest that international remittances may exacerbate income inequality (Leones et Feldman, 1998 ; Nguyen Viet, 2008 ; Stark et al., 1986 ). This finding is attributed to the costs associated with migration, as international migration tends to be a costly endeavour involving expenses such as paperwork, travel, and job search costs. Hence, international migrants often come from middle to upper-income groups. In contrast, other microeconomic studies (Ratha, 2003 ; Taylor & Wyatt, 1996 ) and macroeconomic studies (Acosta et al., 2008 ; Chauvet & Mesplé-Somps, 2007 ; Ebeke & Goff, 2010 ) found that remittances can mitigate income inequality in developing countries. For instance, McKenzie and Rapoport (2007)  conducted a study in Mexico, revealing an inverted U-shaped relationship between migration and income inequality in rural sending communities. In other words, in communities with low levels of international migration, further migration flows initially increase income inequality, but as migration levels rise, income inequality is ultimately reduced. The authors argued that as international migration becomes more widespread, its effects on income inequality should become more equalizing over time.  2.10 Impact of remittances on SDG 13: Climate Action Remittances emerge as a valuable funding source for climate-resilient infrastructure projects. Indeed, families residing in regions prone to climate-related disasters can use remittance income to construct or fortify their homes and communities, enhancing their ability to withstand extreme weather events. This proactive approach significantly contributes to climate adaptation (SDG 13). Recipient families can strategically allocate remittances towards disaster preparedness and response measures. This includes the establishment of emergency savings and investment in early warning systems. These measures collectively enhance the community's resilience to climate-related disasters. Several empirical studies highlight the pivotal role of remittances as a safety net for impoverished families affected by climate-related crises in various sub-Saharan African countries (Couharde & Generoso, 2015 ; Findley, 1994 ; Musah-Surugu et al., 2017 ). Additionally, research by Musah-Surugu et al. (2017)  and Babagaliyeva, Kayumov, Mahmadullozoda, and Mustaeva (2017) , examining the impact of remittances on local-level climate change adaptation in Ghana and Tajikistan, respectively, reveals the effectiveness of remittances in channelling adaptation funding to the most vulnerable households. Furthermore, remittances play a key role in facilitating the adoption of clean energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines. This will diminish reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, which align with broader objectives aimed at combating climate change and promoting cleaner energy sources (Barkat et al., 2023 ). It is worth noting that an increase in international remittances may be harmful to the environment by triggering the consumption and production of goods that require intensive energy consumption, leading to environmental damage (Dash et al., 2024 ). In this context, several empirical studies show the negative effect of international remittances on CO2  emissions and environmental pollution (Yang et al., 2020 ; Khan et al., 2020 ; Rahman et al., 2021 ).  2.11 Impact of remittances on SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals As a reliable and growing source of financing development, remittances can help to strengthen partnerships between governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders. One way in which remittances contribute to SDG 17 is by supporting the development of financial markets and institutions. When migrants send money home, they help in increasing the liquidity of financial markets allowing businesses to easily access credit. This can lead to increased investment and economic growth, which benefits all stakeholders in the economy. Remittances can also help promoting financial inclusion, particularly for women and marginalized groups. When remittance receivers have access to formal financial services, they are better able to save, invest, and start businesses. This can help in reducing poverty and inequality and contributes to a more inclusive and sustainable economy. Some initiatives recognize remittances as a vital tool for sustainable development, such as The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM), which calls for governments and other stakeholders to work together to reduce the cost of remittances and make it easier for migrants to send money to their countries. Another initiative from the World Bank, namely The World Bank's Global Partnership on Financial Inclusion (GPFI) attempts to promote financial inclusion for all, including remittance receivers. The GPFI supports a variety of programs that help increasing access to financial services for low-income people. Finally, The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD ) supports smallholder farmers in developing countries using remittances funds. IFAD's programs help farmers to access credit, improve their production practices, and market their products. Fig. 1   summarizes the different mechanisms through which remittances affect the various SDGs achievement.   3 Data and estimation methodology 3.1 Data and variables description This study explores the impact of remittances and financial inclusion on the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in developing countries. Our dataset comprises 109 countries, categorized as follows: 41 upper-middle-income countries, 47 lower-middle-income countries, and 21 low-income countries, based on the 2023 World Bank classification. In terms of regional distribution, our sample includes 46 African countries, 35 Asian countries, 19 Latin American countries, and 9 European countries.2  2 Please refer to Table A1  in the Appendix for a comprehensive list of these countries.   The data we have collected spans the period from 2000 to 2022. Regarding the dependent variable, we use the SDGs Index, in which scores are presented on a scale of 0–100 and can be interpreted as a percentage towards optimal SDGs performance. This index is extracted from The Sustainable Development Report  2023 by (Sachs et al., 2023 , p. 2023) and provides an assessment of the progress made towards the SDGs by all UN Member States. Our main explanatory variable, remittances, is denoted by personal remittance received (as a % of GDP) and extracted from the World Development Indicators (WDI, 2023). Furthermore, to capture the mediating role of financial inclusion on the effect of remittances on SDGs, we have constructed a composite financial inclusion index using a two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) method (Cámara & Tuesta, 2014 ; Nguyen, 2020 ; Tram et al., 2021 ; Lenka & Bairwa, 2016 ). This method has been commonly employed in empirical research for its accuracy in determining appropriate weights (parametric method) in index construction, as opposed to the nonparametric methods, which rely on the researcher's intuition when assigning weights (Nguyen, 2020 ; Tram et al., 2021 ). In the first stage of constructing the index, we applied the PCA method to estimate two key dimensions representing financial inclusion, namely, “availability ” and “usage ”. It is important to note that we excluded the “penetration ” dimension from our index due to missing data.3  3 The data is only available for 60 developing countries. Using the dimension penetration  would limit our baseline estimation. We include it, however, in Section 4.3 to determine the role of each financial inclusion component in mediating the remittances–SDGs relationship.   For the availability  dimension, we utilized the number of commercial bank branches (per 100,000 adults) and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) (per 100,000 adults). For the usage  dimension, we considered the outstanding deposits (% of GDP) and outstanding loans (% of GDP) (Sarma, 2008 ; Nguyen, 2020 ; Tram et al., 2021 ; Lenka & Bairwa, 2016 ). In the second stage, we followed a similar procedure applying the PCA method to estimate an overall Financial Inclusion Index (FII) using the two sub-indices obtained in the first stage and calculating their respective weights in the overall FII. We have also incorporated various control variables that are commonly employed in the existing literature. These variables include economic growth, inflation, government spending, trade openness, and a governance index constructed using the PCA method. We provide below the definitions and the justifications for the choice of each variable to be included in our empirical models: Economic Growth:  is defined as real GDP growth. The inclusion of real GDP growth as a control variable is grounded in the theory that economic growth can influence a country's ability to achieve SDGs. Higher economic growth may lead to increased government revenue and investments in areas such as education, health, and infrastructure, which directly impact SDGs' attainment (WTO, 2018 ). Additionally, economic growth may improve the standards of living and job opportunities, thereby supporting sustainable development (Halim and Rahman; 2022 ; Jiang et al., 2022 ; Rosa, 2017 ). Trade Openness:  Trade openness, as measured by the share of the sum of exports and imports of goods and services in total GDP, is fundamental for achieving SDGs. The World Trade Organization (WTO), which plays a key role in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, highlights trade's essential contribution to sustainable development. Historically, trade has been a driving force behind development and poverty alleviation, particularly in developing nations (Alsamara et al., 2019 ; Bangoura et al., 2013 ; Barkat, Jarallah, & Alsamara, 2024 ). Thus, stimulating trade may provide the means to achieve various development objectives in social and environmental areas (Barkat, Alsamara, et al., 2024 ). Furthermore, trade contributes in reducing poverty by creating job opportunities and decreasing the costs of goods and services for low-income consumers, including staple items such as food. Hence, trade is instrumental in advancing SDGs progress by fostering economic growth and enhancing the life quality in developing countries (WTO, 2018 ). Inflation :  is an important control variable as it can reflect the stability of a country's macroeconomic environment. High inflation may erode purchasing power and create economic uncertainty, potentially slowing progress towards the SDGs. In contrast, low and stable inflation is conducive to sustainable economic development and growth (Halim and Rahman; 2022 ). Government Spending :  Government spending as a percentage of GDP is a crucial variable to consider in our models because it represents the extent to which a government invests in its population's welfare and development. Investments in education, health, and infrastructure are of utmost importance for achieving SDGs (Cristóbal et al., 2021 ). Government spending can also play a role in creating an enabling environment for the positive impact of remittances (OECD, 2017 ). Governance Index:  The governance index with a higher score indicating a better level of governance is constructed using the PCA method. It comprises various aspects of governance such as control of corruption, government effectiveness, quality of regulation, political stability, rule of law, and voice and accountability, all sourced from the World Development Indicators of the World Bank (WDI, 2023). Several empirical studies support that strong governance is fundamental for sustainable development as it ensures efficient allocation of resources (Delavallade, 2006 ; Nyamongo & Schoeman, 2010 ; O'hare & Hall, 2022 , pp. 109–129) and effective implementation of policies to achieve SDGs (Sari, 2023 ). Good governance can also attract foreign investments, including remittances, which can further support SDGs (Globerman & Shapiro, 2002 ; Halim & Rahman, 2022 ; O'hare & Hall, 2022 , pp. 109–129). Table 1   reports the descriptive statistics of the variables outlined above .4  4 Please refer to Table A2  in the Appendix for a comprehensive list of all variables used in this study.   A careful inspection of this table reveals that the mean score on the SDGs Performance Index for the developing countries included in our sample is 59.66. This implies that these countries have achieved around 60% of the progress required to meet the SDGs but are still approximately 40% short of attaining them by the year 2030. Afghanistan had the lowest score of 36 in the year 2000, while Moldova achieved the highest score of 79 in 2021. When examining these scores in terms of income groups, it comes as no surprise that low-income countries have the lowest performance score at 48, followed by lower-middle-income countries at 58, and upper-middle-income countries at 66. These statistics can be explained by the fact that the achievement of the SDGs predominantly depends on investments in human capital and physical infrastructure. Moreover, poor countries often lack the financial flexibility to respond to crises like COVID-19 and climate change-related events while also investing in sustainable development. This financial constraint is due, among other factors, to their limited access to favorable terms in financial markets. Regarding our variable of interest, lower-middle-income countries have received a higher average of remittances, equivalent to 7% of their GDP. In contrast, upper-middle-income and low-income countries received 5.35% and 3.09%, respectively. Interestingly, the highest remittances-to-GDP ratio was recorded in a sub-Saharan country, Lesotho, where remittances accounted for over 50% of the GDP in 2000. For the two indices that we have constructed, namely financial inclusion and quality of governance, both exhibit negative signs for low and lower-middle-income countries. In contrast, they show a positive value for upper-middle-income countries. This implies that countries with higher incomes tend to have more favorable financial and governance indicators. The correlation matrix reported in Table 2  , shows the potential relationships between SDGs and the other variables used in our study. Remittances, economic growth, government spending, trade openness, governance, and financial inclusion index, exhibit a positive correlation with our dependent variable (SDGs), while inflation, and population growth show a negative correlation with the SDGs variable. To ensure that there are no issues of multicollinearity between the independent variables, which may lead to inconsistent results, we use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test to assess whether potential multicollinearities exist in our data. A general rule of thumb is that the maximum VIF should not exceed 10. The results in Table 3   indicate that VIF values for the explanatory variables included in our model do not exceed 2, implying that multicollinearity issues are not severe in our data.  3.2 Estimation methods This study employs fixed and random effects models for baseline estimation. However, these methods may not adequately address potential endogeneity issues, potentially leading to inconsistent estimators (Barkat et al., 2023 ; Li et al., 2021 ). Given the prevalence of endogeneity issues in empirical studies with panel data, it is important to account for these challenges to ensure reliable results. The subsequent section discusses the potential sources of endogeneity that may arise in our model and outlines methods to address these issues. 3.2.1 Endogeneity issues In panel data, endogeneity can occur due to omitted variables, reverse causality, measurement error, or simultaneity bias (Barkat et al., 2023 ). Our analysis may face reverse causality between our variable of interest (remittances) and the dependent variable (SDGs score). While remittances can positively impact SDGs score by providing additional financial resources for development projects, higher SDGs score may also attract more remittances. Improved SDGs score could signal economic stability and better opportunities, encouraging increased financial flows from abroad. Another potential source of endogeneity is dynamic endogeneity, which can arise when past values of the dependent variable influence the current values of the independent variable. For instance, current levels of remittances may be affected by recent SDGs achievement levels. Foreign workers often send more money to families with low incomes and high living needs to improve their well-being. Therefore, past levels of SDGs achievement in areas such as health, education, poverty, and hunger may impact current remittances levels. Our model may also suffer from omitted variable bias. Unobserved factors such as cultural attitudes, informal institutions, or other country-specific characteristics may simultaneously influence both remittances and SDGs score. To address these potential sources of endogeneity, the literature often employs methods such as Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) or the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). While the first method requires at least one external instrument for the endogenous variables, the latter relies on internal instruments by using lags of the variables as instruments. Given the challenge of identifying suitable external instruments that correlate with remittances and are uncorrelated with the error term for all 109 sample countries, we employ the system Generalized Method of Moments (system GMM) for two main reasons: First, system GMM uses lagged variables as instruments, allowing us to effectively control for reverse causality and other endogeneity concerns. These lagged variables provide information about the past relationships between variables, helping establish a more causal direction in our analysis. Second, system GMM is particularly well-suited for dynamic panel data models where the dependent variable is potentially influenced by its past values (dynamic endogeneity). Third, system GMM combines both level and difference equations, enabling us to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches. The level equation incorporates current-period values, while the difference equation focuses on changes over time. This combination improves efficiency and produces more reliable estimates (Blundell & Bond, 1998 ). To ensure the reliability of our results, we conduct two major statistical tests, namely the Hansen J  test of over-identifying restrictions to assess the validity of our instruments and the AR (2) test that controls for the absence of second-order serial correlation among the differenced residuals (Ullah et al.2018 ; Li et al., 2021 ). Finally, we perform robustness checks using alternative estimation methods such as the Lewbel (2012) heteroskedasticity-identified endogenous variable regression model. This technique can be useful in panel data when external instruments are not available (Lewbel, 2012). It is important to note that this method, implemented with only internal instruments, can perform as good as other estimators that use external instruments (Barkat et al., 2023 ; Chaudhry & Shafiullah, 2021 ).  3.2.2 Empirical model To derive our empirical model, we rely on the Cobb-Douglas production functions’ framework. This is a well-established theoretical model in economics that describes the relationship between inputs (such as capital and labor) and output in an economy. Our model extends this framework by examining how various inputs, including remittances and control variables, influence SDGs score as an output measure of sustainable development. In the Cobb-Douglas function, the total factor productivity represents the efficiency with which inputs are converted into output. In our model, financial inclusion acts as a mediator, enhancing the efficiency of remittances and other control variables in achieving SDGs. Hence, the model equation employed in the study is as follows:(1) S D G  i t   = α 0  + α 1  S D G  i t − 1   + α  2  R E M  i t   + α 3  G D P G  i t   + α 4  G S  i t   + α 5  P O P G  i t   + α 6   INF i t   + α 7  T R A  i t   + α 8  G O V  i t   + α 9  F I I  i t   + μ  i t       i = 1 , 2 , 3 , … N ; t = 1 , 2 , 3 , … , T     Where S D G  i t      is the SDGs Index, in which scores are presented on a scale of 0–100 and represent the percentage towards optimal SDGs performance, G D P G  i t      is the per capita GDP growth, R E M  i t       is our variable of interest and represents remittances received as percent of GDP, G S  i t      is the government spending (in % of GDP), and P O P G  i t      indicates the population growth. INF i t      refers to the rate of inflation in the country. T R A  i t      is a proxy for trade openness, measured as the share of the sum of exports and imports of goods and services in GDP, G O V  i t      refers to the level of governance, and F I I  i t      is the financial inclusion index. Equation (1)  is then augmented by including the interactive terms between remittances and the financial inclusion index in equation (2)  to assess whether the effects of remittances depend on the level of financial inclusion in developing countries.(2) S D G  i t   = α 0  + α 1  S D G  i t − 1   + α  2  R E M  i t   + α 3  G D P G  i t   + α 4  G S  i t   + α 5  P O P G  i t   + α 6   INF i t   + α 7  T R A  i t   + α 8  G O V  i t   + α 9  F I I  i t   + α 10  ( R E M * F I I  )  i t   + μ  i t        Differentiating equation (2)  with respect to remittances, yields equation (3)  which provides the marginal effect of remittances on SDGs for different levels of financial inclusion in developing countries.(3) M R E M = ∂ S D G  ∂ REM   = α 2  + α 10  F I I         4 Empirical estimation results 4.1 Main results Table 4   reports the results from the empirical estimation using fixed and random effects as baseline estimation and the system GMM to control endogeneity. In specifications 1, 2, and 3 of Table 4 , we estimate the baseline equation without the interactive term between remittances and financial inclusion. We then add the interactive term of these two variables in specifications 4, 5, and 6. According to the Hausman test results reported at the bottom of Table 4 , the test statistic is significantly different from zero suggesting that the random effects model is inconsistent and less efficient compared to the fixed effects model. In such case, the fixed effects estimator is more relevant. Hence, we only consider the results obtained from the fixed effects and system GMM models. The results reveal a consistently positive and highly significant relationship between our main variable of interest, remittances, and the SDGs performance index in all model specifications. The coefficient for remittances variable ranges from 0.020 to 0.208, indicating that a 1% increase in remittances corresponds to a rise of between 0.02 and 0.21% in the SDGs performance index. It is important to highlight that the magnitude of this causality obtained from the fixed effects estimator (0.208) surpasses that of the system GMM estimator (0.020). According to Li et al. (2021) , the fixed effects estimator may exhibit bias in the presence of dynamic endogeneity. Consequently, it tends to overestimate the relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables. In such cases, the results derived from the system GMM are more reliable. Interestingly, when we augment our model by including the interaction between remittances and financial inclusion index (Spe 6), the results show a positive and significant coefficient of the interactive term between these two variables. Accordingly, when the level of financial inclusion is high, an increase in remittances will accelerate the achievement of the SDGs. For instance, for the lowest financial inclusion level of −12.56 (see Table 1 ), the interactive coefficient in Spe 6 indicates that the effect of remittances on the SDG performance index is 0.014 + (0.020*(−12,56)) = -0.23 . Thus, lower financial inclusion reduces the beneficial effects of remittances on SDGs. This might be explained by the limited financial access and a lack of investment opportunities in such settings. Similarly, at the median FII level of −0.19, the direct effect of remittances on the SDGs index is −0.01. Lastly, at the highest level of the financial inclusion index (3.72), the effect becomes 0.09. These results reveal the role of financial inclusion in determining the effectiveness of remittances in supporting SDGs achievement. This positive impact can be attributed to improved access to financial services, enhanced investment opportunities, and better risk mitigation strategies. For the control variables, the results suggest that economic growth, government spending, governance, and financial inclusion have a positive impact on the SDGs performance index. These findings align with previous research indicating that economic growth can contribute to achieving SDGs due to increased resources and investment opportunities (Singh et al., 2022 ). Government spending, particularly when invested effectively in areas related to SDGs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, can significantly facilitate their achievement. Moreover, good governance practices, which include transparency, accountability, and effective institutions, are conducive to advancing SDGs. The positive relationship with the financial inclusion index indicates that when more people have access to financial services and products, it can contribute to better SDGs outcomes, likely by reducing poverty and inequality. On the other hand, the results in Table 4  show that inflation, trade openness, and population growth have a negative effect on the SDGs performance index. The negative effect of inflation on the SDGs performance index suggests that high inflation rates may hinder progress towards achieving SDGs. Inflation can decrease purchasing power and economic stability, potentially affecting the ability to invest in sustainable development. Surprisingly, trade openness has a negative effect on SDGs’ performance. However, the coefficient is only significant at the 10% level. Finally, the rapid population growth may pose challenges for sustainable development and put further pressures on limited resources, making it more challenging to achieve the SDGs. To investigate whether the above results are region-specific, we augment the model by including interactive terms between remittances and each region dummy (Africa, Asia, and Latin America) in Table 5   (Spe 1, 2, and 3, respectively). These regions are usually characterized by different SDGs performance progress. Moreover, they have different economic and political characteristics such as economic growth, size of remittances, financial inclusion, population size, political stability, and governance quality. Hence, studying these regions individually helps identifying the specific effectiveness of remittances by region. The results in Table 5  show positive and significant coefficients for the interactive terms between remittances and all regional groups (Spe 1, 2, and 3). For instance, remittances to African countries appear to have a more pronounced effect leading to larger SDGs progress compared to the other two regions. Specifically, a 1% increase in remittances is associated with a 0.21% increase in the SDGs performance index in Africa, while the corresponding effects for Asia and Latin America are 0.05 and 0.03%, respectively. These results can be explained by the fact that the African continent has the lowest SDGs index on average compared to the other continents (see Table A3  in the appendix). Thus, remittances appear to have more impact on SDGs in the African countries as the needs are larger, making them a major source of income for low-income households. These funds can be used to improve living standards, access to education and healthcare, and reduce poverty. As a result, remittances can directly contribute to the achievement of several SDGs, particularly those related to poverty reduction and access to basic services in this region. We also study if the causality between remittances and SDGs is income dependent. To do so, we include interactive terms between remittances and income groups (low, lower-middle, and upper middle-income countries) in Spe 4, 5 and 6 of Table 5 . The results show positive and significant coefficients for the interactive terms between remittances and all income groups, with a higher coefficient observed for low-income countries. Accordingly, remittances to this group of countries appear to have a more pronounced effect on accelerating SDGs progress compared to the other two income groups. This finding aligns with our previous results by region, as most of low-income countries in our sample are located in Africa (18 of the 21 low-income counties included in this study belong to the African continent). We now extend our analysis by examining the effects of remittances on the performance of each SDG individually. Specifically, we explore the relationship between remittances and the following SDGs (discussed in Section 2 ): SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). The results of this analysis are presented in Table 6  . The findings reported in Table 6  reveal that remittances exert a positive and statistically significant influence on all SDGs, with one exception being SDG 6, Clean Water and Sanitation, where the coefficient is negative and statistically significant. Overall, the results suggest that remittances effectively contribute to the reduction of inequalities, alleviation of income and energy poverty, and the eradication of hunger. They also support the enhancement of good health and well-being, improve the quality of education, promote decent work and economic growth, and advance of partnerships for achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, our results indicate that the interactive terms between remittances and financial inclusion are positive and significant for all SDGs. This is consistent with our previous finding highlighting the role of financial inclusion as a channel through which remittances affect SDGs.  4.2 Robustness check and further investigations To assess the robustness of our findings and further investigate the remittances–SDGs nexus, we conduct three further analyses. First, we employ system-GMM and Lewbel's (2012) estimator to investigate which aspects of financial inclusion are most relevant to achieving the SDGs. Second, we explore the mediating effect of financial inclusion. Finally, we empirically examine and discuss other crucial sources of funding that may influence SDGs, such as government spending in various sectors and foreign aid. 4.2.1 The effect of financial inclusion components on SDGs outputs To investigate which characteristic of financial inclusion matters for achieving the SDGs, we use each of the three dimensions of the financial inclusion index, namely “Availability ”, “usage ”, and “penetration ” as explanatory variable in equation (2) . Due to missing data, the estimation for the last dimension (penetration ) has been performed using 60 developing countries only for which data is available. This dimension includes two components: depositors and borrowers with commercial banks (per 1000 adults). Our primary objective in this analysis is to examine whether our results are robust to the use of each component included in the financial inclusion proxy separately. This approach will also allow us to identify which dimension is the most influential mediating variable between remittances and the SDGs performance index. The results are presented in Table 7  . The findings in Table 7  reveal that the positive impact of remittances on the SDGs performance is robust to the use of each of the three components of the financial inclusion index for both estimators (system GMM and Lewbel (2012)). Furthermore, the interactive terms between remittances and the three dimensions of FII are all positive and statistically significant. Interestingly, both methods reveal that the remittances usage  dimension exhibits the highest coefficient, followed by penetration  and availability  dimensions, respectively. Thus, our findings highlight the pivotal role of the usage  dimension of financial inclusion in strengthening the positive impact of remittances on the achievement of SDGs. Accordingly, remittances are more effective in reaching the SDGs when the country has more usage of financial services.  4.2.2 Mediating effect of financial inclusion We now use the financial inclusion index and its three components (usage , availability , and penetration ) as mediating variables to explore the effect of remittances on the SDGs performance index. To this end, we employ the two-staged estimation widely used to study potential mediation between two variables (Barkat et al., 2023 ; Dogan et al., 2022 ; Munyanyi & Churchill, 2022 ; Qin et al., 2024 ). This estimation consists of two sequential steps. In the first step, we compute the correlation between remittances and the financial inclusion proxies (i.e. the FII and each of its components). If the correlation between these variables is significant, we move to the second step to validate whether these financial inclusion proxies (mediators) are indeed mediating factors through which remittances impact SDGs. Specifically, to perform the second step, several sequential tasks are required. First, we regress the SDGs performance index on remittances and record the resulting coefficient, which will be used as a benchmark. We then add each of the mediators as additional covariate in the regression. If the mediator's inclusion causes a reduction in the benchmark coefficient of our remittances variable or makes it statistically insignificant, then we validate the corresponding variable as a potential mediator (channel) through which remittances affect SDGs. The results of the two steps estimation are reported in Table 8  . The results in Table 8  show that remittances have a positive and significant effect on the financial inclusion index and its components (first step), suggesting that remittances promote financial inclusion in developing countries. This result is in line with those of Naceur et al. (2020) , Tu et al. (2019) , and Eggoh and Bangaké (2021) . Therefore, given the significant correlation, the financial inclusion index and its components can be considered as potential channels of influence and moved the second step of the estimation. Hence, we regress the SDGs performance index on the variables remittances and FII, remittances and Usage, remittances and Availability, and remittances and Penetration (second step). The coefficient on the remittance's variables in each of these estimations is compared to the benchmark regression where only the remittances variable is included as an explanatory variable (column 1). The results from the second step reveal that the FII variable and its components all have a positive and highly significant effect on SDG performance index. This result aligns with those obtained in Table 7 . Interestingly, the inclusion of these mediators as additional covariates reduced the magnitude of the remittance's variable coefficient compared to the benchmark model in column1. Hence, these mediators are significant channels through which remittances influence SDGs progress. It appears, therefore, that remittances impact SDGs through better financial inclusion. This result suggests that remittances play a crucial role in influencing the achievement of SDGs by improving financial inclusion.5  5 As robustness check, we estimated the two sequential steps using Lewbel's (2012) method. The results reported in Table A5  in the Appendix are similar to those obtained in Table 8 .   In other words, it appears that the positive impact of remittances on SDGs is mediated or facilitated by advancements in financial inclusion. This finding implies that as remittance inflows increase, individuals and communities are better able to harness improved access to financial services, which in turn enhances their capacity to contribute to sustainable development objectives. This link between remittances and better financial inclusion shows the interconnected nature of economic and developmental factors, emphasizing the importance of inclusive financial systems in realizing the broader goals of sustainable development.  4.2.3 The role of governments funding in achieving the SDGs: Complement or substitute to remittances? Government funding plays a crucial role in advancing the SDGs by supporting key sectors such as education, health, infrastructure, and social welfare (O'hare & Hall, 2022 , pp. 109–129). Effective government investment in these areas creates a positive environment for the advancement of sustainable development by addressing fundamental needs, improving quality of life, and fostering inclusive economic growth. Additionally, government policies and funding can accelerate progress towards achieving specific SDGs by setting clear targets and implementing programs tailored to local needs. In addition to government funding, foreign aid, also known as Official Development Assistance (ODA), is another vital source of financing for achieving SDGs in developing countries. ODA provides additional resources for projects and initiatives that may not be fully supported by domestic funding. It can significantly strengthen critical areas such as healthcare, education, energy, environment, and infrastructure, all of which are essential for sustainable development (Iacobuţă et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, ODA facilitates knowledge transfer and capacity building, enabling countries to better plan and implement strategies to achieve the SDGs (WTO, 2018 ). To assess the impact of government funding (i.e. government funding in investment (INV), government expenditure in education (GEE) and government expenditure in health (GHE)) and foreign aid (ODA)6  6 Please refer to Table A3  in the Appendix for the definition and sources of all these variables.   on SDGs scores, we implement several estimations. First, we examine the effect of these variables by employing seven different specifications reported in Table 9  . The first two specifications assess the impact of ODA and government funding in investment on the global SDGs score. The third and fourth specifications evaluate the effects of government health expenditure on SDGs 3 and 8. Specifications 5, 6, and 7 investigate the impact of government education spending on SDGs 4, 5, and 8, respectively. Second, we introduce interactive terms between these variables and remittances to test their incremental contribution towards SDGs progress depending on the level of remittances. Additionally, we explore the interaction between these funds and institutional variables to assess the effects of government funding and ODA on SDGs progress, considering the quality of governance. The results including the interactive terms are reported in Table 10  . The results presented in Table 9  demonstrate that the coefficient for the INV variable is positive and highly significant. Specifically, a 1% increase in government investment corresponds to a 0.063% increase in global SDGs progress. Specification 2 also indicates that foreign aid positively affects SDGs outcomes, highlighting the substantial role of government investment and ODA in advancing SDGs. Specifications 3 and 4 reveal that government health spending has a significant positive impact on SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth). Similarly, the results from specifications 5, 6, and 7 suggest that government spending in education positively influences SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 5 (gender equality). These findings indicate that strategic investments in health and education play a pivotal role in achieving multiple SDGs. It is worth noting that the coefficients of these variables are greater than those of remittances in all specifications, except in specification 2 related to the ODA variable. Accordingly, education and health spending have more pronounced effects on specific SDGs scores compared to remittances. These results highlight the importance of dedicated spending (targeted to specific SDGs) and the crucial role of governments in achieving SDGs. Specifications 1–4 in Table 10  include an interactive term between the level of governance in a country and INV, GHE, GEE, and ODA variables, while specifications 5–8 incorporate interactive terms between remittances and INV, GHE, GEE, and ODA variables. The results reported in Table 10  reveal three key findings. First, all interactive terms between governance level and INV, GHE, and GEE produce positive and statistically significant coefficients. This implies that government funding, irrespective of its form, is more effective in achieving SDGs when governance quality is higher. Our findings align with the results of O'hare and Hall (2022) . Second, the coefficient for the interactive term between governance and ODA is also positive and significant, supporting the idea that aid has a greater impact on SDGs in countries with high-quality governance and better stability (Barkat & Alsamara, 2019 ; Barkat et al., 2016 ; Yahyaoui & Bouchoucha, 2020 ). Third, all interactive terms between remittances and government funding, regardless of its type, are positive and statistically significant, indicating a complementary relationship between these two sources of funding. This implies that government investments in health and education as well as international aid enhance the beneficial effects of remittances on SDGs achievements. This synergy leads to improved human capital, stronger health outcomes, higher economic productivity, more productive investments, and reduced inequality—all of which contribute to achieving SDGs targets more effectively.7  7 We also conducted the same estimations in Tables 9 and 10  using the Lewbel (2012) estimator, and the results are similar in terms of sign and significance. These results are available upon request.      5 Conclusion and policy recommendations Recent years have witnessed significant obstacles to progress in achieving the 2030 agenda and the SDGs due to pandemics, natural disasters associated with climate change, and the escalation of global and regional conflicts. These events have contributed, in part, to the rising costs of energy and food. Consequently, the question of financing SDGs has become central to achieving these goals and advancing towards the 2030 agenda. Our analysis addressed this challenge by conducting an in-depth examination of the impact of remittances on the attainment of SDGs, using a comprehensive dataset covering 109 countries and spanning the period from 2000 to 2022. We find that remittances have a significant and positive effect on the achievement of SDGs. Moreover, we show that the impact of remittances is more pronounced as the level of financial inclusion increases. Our analysis across geographical groups reveals that the interaction between remittances and financial inclusion has a consistent positive and statistically significant effect on SDGs across all groups. This reveals the critical role that financial inclusion plays in the relationship between remittances and SDG achievement. Additionally, we show that remittances exert a positive effect on the attainment of 10 specific SDGs (SDG 1, 2,3, 4, 5,7, 8, 10, 13 and 17). Finally, we demonstrate that financial inclusion serves as a potential mediator through which remittances influence progress towards SDGs. Overall, our findings provide several policy recommendations that can assist governments and policymakers in their decision-making processes towards advancing the 2030 agenda. First, policymakers should prioritize efforts to improve access to financial services, particularly for underserved populations. This can maximize the positive impact of remittances and empower marginalized groups. Second, incentives to channel remittance flows into projects that address critical SDGs such as poverty reduction, health, education, and gender equality should be implemented. This can be achieved through partnerships with financial institutions and non-governmental organizations. Third, governments should invest in financial infrastructure that supports efficient remittance flows, in addition to reducing transaction costs and regulatory barriers. This facilitates the effective utilization of remittances for development projects. Government should also continuously assess remittance flows and their impact on SDGs through data collection, research, and knowledge sharing to enhance the understanding of the complex relationship between remittances and sustainable development. This helps identify emerging challenges and opportunities, potentially allowing for adaptive policy responses. Finally, policymakers should align remittance strategies with other sources of funding, such as government funding and foreign aid. This synergy can amplify the overall impact on sustainable development.  Funding None.
