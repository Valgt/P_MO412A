               For decades, microalgal biotechnology has experienced impressive growth due to its application capacity for the production of bioenergy as well as its potential for bioremediation, through technologies considered to be environmentally sustainable. However, human interest in microalgae has changed exponentially, and the use of microalgae as base ingredients for food supplements, valuing the functional and nutritional quality of its biochemical composition, has driven industrial markets. In parallel, a new issue emerges: Can natural ingredients be considered sustainable foods? To answer this knowledge gap, sustainability assessments have been proposed in order to measure the real impacts of natural ingredients production to microalgae-based. After all, one of the main limitations of the microalgae-based process is related to the energy demand, the requirement of high water and nutrient use, which cast doubt on the real sustainability of microalgal products. In this sense, this chapter aims to address ways of how the production of microalgae can contribute to achieving the global sustainable development goals. Besides, the methodology for assessing sustainability indicators will be reviewed, with an exclusive focus on bio-based processes. A closer look at the energy-water-carbon nexus applied to the production of microalgae-based ingredients was addressed, in order to point out the microalgal processes hotspot, presenting their environmental vulnerabilities, offering alternative improvements to obtain more efficient, equitable, and fair use of natural resources, promoting global sustainability.

Keywords Microalgae  Sustainable development goals  Metrics sustainability and indicators  Environmental footprint   1 Introduction Innovation is the backbone of many companies in the food sector, as the volatility of consumer preferences and profiles is often associated with an uncertainty whirlwind. Thus, to ensure space and future market consolidation, new value-added product strategies are constantly put to the test on supermarket shelves (Lafarga et al., 2021 ). From this perspective, recent technological advances, changes in the population’s lifestyle, as well as socioeconomic trends, have driven the need for foods with greater health promotion, giving rise to the following of functional foods (Tadesse and Emire, 2020 ). Undeniably, the global demand for functional foods is expanding at a robust pace. This sector was recently valued at USD 98.9 billion, and market inclinations predict that it will be estimated at USD 137.1 billion in 2026, recording a CAGR of 6.8%, during the period 2021–2027 (Anil and Roshan, 2020 ). Thus, the main players that move these markets are represented by specific ingredients such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, hydrocolloids, prebiotics, amino acids, plant extracts, and carotenoids. However, with the market’s rapid expansion and the available raw materials lacking, microalgae are emerging once again in the global market but are now boosted in the functional and nutritional segment. In fact, research in microalgal biotechnology is not recent. This is because microalgal biomass has been consumed for thousands of years by colonizing people. However, in the last 70 years, these microorganisms have emerged in the scientific milieu as a modern raw material to be applied in the bioenergy and waste treatment sectors (Deprá et al., 2018 ; Severo et al., 2019a ; Jacob-Lopes et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, the emphasis on microalgal biotechnology attributed to food ingredients has only gained prominence in the last two decades (Maroneze et al., 2019 ; do Nascimento et al., 2020 ). Since then, scientific advances have shown us the incomparable profile of this biomass, whose high nutritional and functional value results from its high nutrient content and bioactive compounds, such as proteins, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and chlorophylls (Fernandes et al., 2021 ). So, with recent scientific findings increasingly bringing their benefits to light, microalgae continued to move the global economy at an exponential level. Proof of this is that, even in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, the global microalgae market was estimated at USD 3.4 billion in the year 2020, and it is projected to reach a size of USD 4.6 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 4.3% in the reporting period 2020–2027 (Markets and Markets Reports, 2021 ). In both scenarios, the microalgal biomass phenomenon can successfully corroborate and take a position. However, the technology to produce microalgae is still immature. This is because on a large scale, biologically based processes face several obstacles such as the high demand for energy and nutrients, which make commercial competitiveness unfeasible. Therefore, it is desirable that there is a leap in the development of microalgae technology; on a practical level, the scale of production needs to increase with a concomitant decrease in the cost of production (Kratzer and Murkovic, 2021 ). Concurrently, linked to technological bottlenecks, questions about its environmental benefits are debatable. This is because microalgae are often associated with raw materials and sustainable technologies, due to their high carbon photo-sequestering potential (Xu et al., 2021 ). However, the sustainability notion goes beyond, as it also encompasses social and economic indicators. Thus, based on the various aspects of sustainability concepts, the idea that microalgae are fundamentally sustainable must be thoroughly investigated, since sustainability has become an important criterion in decision-making in the daily life of more aware consumers. Therefore, in this new era of the global search for health-promoting products, it is essential to expand the knowledge on sustainability metrics and indicators of microalgae-based ingredients. Thus, our contribution with this chapter was to bring together addressing microalgae as a key to achieving sustainable goals. In addition, our view on sustainability metrics and indicators was revised under the context of applying microalgae-based bioprocesses. Finally, the direct relationship under energy-water-carbon in microalgae-based ingredients production was discussed in order to further elucidate possible technological paths to circumvent the application bottlenecks of microalgal processes.  2 How can microalgae contribute to sustainable development goals? In today’s global economy, increasing stakeholder pressure and widespread recognition that environmental activities are critical to the ecosystem have led companies to implement sustainable practices across all unit operations in the production chain (Stekelorum et al., 2021 ). As a result, the bearable intensification of manufacturing systems is the recurrent mantra in forecasting a sustainable future for economic and social scenarios. Against this backdrop, an action plan for all individuals and the ecosystem was collectively built to put the world on a more sustainable and resilient path by 2030. This set of actions—known as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—was assumed by all United Nations Member States in Agenda 2030 (Merlo et al., 2021 ) (Fig. 1  ). In short, the 2030 Agenda consists of a Declaration, a results framework—the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets—a section on means of implementation and global partnerships, as well as a roadmap for follow-up and review. The 17 objectives are integrated and indivisible, and mix, in a balanced way, the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental. They are like a list of tasks to be accomplished by governments, civil society, the private sector, and all citizens on the collective journey toward a sustainable 2030. Thus, driven by the search for environmental sustainability under the logical integration of industrial symbiosis and circular economy, the microalgae attractiveness has stood out as a motivating alternative to achieve sustainable development goals. In fact, microalgae production provides a benefits combination to our society that goes beyond the potential to supply an additional energy source while supporting or improving environmental sustainability. This is because its ability to produce a wide range of active compounds and the possibility of using alternative resources such as unclassified land as fertile soil, seawater, and reclaimed streams make this microorganism a promising alternative resource (Fig. 2  ) (Herrera et al., 2021 ). Therefore, an overview of the microalgae application and how they support—directly or indirectly—sustainable development goals will be provided below. (i) SDG-2 Zero Hunger:  The main goals to be achieved in this goal are to ensure the need for adequate food supplies and combat malnutrition. Thus, the role of microalgae as an auxiliary tool in combating zero hunger can be presented in two ways: due to the high quality of protein available in the biomass and nutrient supplementation through nutraceuticals from microalgae. In fact, the use of microalgal protein as a new resource is considered a relatively current concept. Several microalgal strains have the same protein content (or higher amounts) when compared to conventional sources such as high-quality animal (beef and swine) and vegetable (soybean, pea, chickpea, etc.) protein (Siahbalaei et al., 2021 ). In addition, commercially available species such as Arthrospira platensis  and Chlorella vulgaris  are recognized by international regulatory bodies (WHO/FAO/UNU) for their well-proportioned amino acid essential profile for human consumption (Jacob-Lopes et al., 2019 ). Additionally, combating malnutrition can be associated with the richness of the chemical composition of the microalgal biomass. Several species of microalgae synthesize compounds with high nutritional value as fatty acids not produced by the human body, such as the fatty acid linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, linoleic, gamma-linolenic, and arachidonic (do Nascimento et al., 2019 ). These, in turn, are essential nutrients for the synthesis of cellular products that strengthen the immune system and other biochemical processes related to metabolism. In addition, microalgal biomass also has a wide range of antioxidant vitamins and pigments, with β-carotene and astaxanthin being the main pigments used as food dyes, due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities (Fernandes et al., 2020 ). (ii) SDG-6 clean water and sanitation and SDG-14 Life below water:  These objectives have as their main purpose to improve the general viability, as well as the sustainable management of drinking water and basic sanitation, including incremental measures for the treatment of wastewater, through the containment of pollution and water recovery. In addition, it is committed to preventing and significantly reducing marine pollution. Faced with this perspective, wastewater treatment through microalgal biotechnology has achieved significant popularity in recent years (Sharma et al., 2021 ). Microalgae are preferred over other traditional wastewater biological treatment systems (such as activated sludge) because they offer attractive benefits such as low energy requirement, cost effectiveness, greater reduction in pollutants and pathogens, nutrient recycling, less sludge formation, greenhouse gases reduction, and nutrient recovery in the valuable biomass form (Ahmad et al., 2021 ). Proof of this is that a sequence of studies developed by dos Santos et al. (2017)  and dos Santos et al. (2020)  show that the simultaneous conversion process of organic matter, nitrogen, and total phosphorus by microalgae using agro-industrial wastewater resulted in removal efficiencies of 97.6%, 85.5%, and 92.4%, respectively. The same removal excellence could also be observed for the removal rates for nitrogen and phosphorus (75% and 50%, respectively) in full-scale municipal wastewater (Sutherland et al., 2018 ). On the other hand, by comparison, the removal rates of conventional waste treatment systems do not exceed 30% (Sutherland et al., 2021 ). In addition, these reductions also beneficially influence the diffuse pollution of water bodies, since there is bioremediation and assimilation by microalgal biomass, protecting the river ecosystem (Merlo et al., 2021 ). Consequently, biomass originating from these processes can also be used to generate a local source of bioenergy in support of ODS-7 (affordable and clean energy). (iii) ODS-7 affordable and clean energy:  This goal strives to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030. In light of this projection, research into green bioenergy has been carried out. Among them, the generation of third-generation biofuels, including biodiesel, bioethanol, biogas, bio-oil, as well as aviation fuels, and bio-electricity, has been proven by microalgal efficiency. However, although promising, the production of microalgae for bioenergy purposes on a large scale still faces barriers to be overcome (Li et al., 2021 ). This is because the high energy requirements in upstream processes—cultivation, harvesting, and drying stages—in addition to the particular doubts about the economic and energy viability of these technologies—test the real effectiveness of systems based on microalgae as a collaborative way to achieve this goal. (iv) SDG-13 climate action:  The battle against catastrophic climate change has never been hotter. Therefore, this objective is intended to take urgent measures to combat climate change and its impacts. In this scenario, microalgae are cited as an important environmental solution that is too necessary and urgent. The biological technique of carbon capture and storage through photosynthetic microorganisms such as microalgae is estimated to be by far the most promising strategy for the mitigation challenges of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (Severo et al., 2019b ; Deprá et al., 2020a ). Attributes such as its high photosynthetic efficiency (8.3%) when compared to terrestrial plants (∼4.6%) confirm the superiority of these microorganisms (de Mendonça et al., 2021 ). Thus, carbon fixed in biomass plays different biological functions, resulting in biomass that can be remodeled and redirected to a wide range of products (food, biofuels, bio-cosmetics, among others) that help in the integrative search for sustainable development (Daneshvar et al., 2022 ). However, key factors such as pH, temperature, salinity, turbidity, nutrient availability, in addition to concentrations of toxic compounds (from flue gases), as well as the design of cultivation systems and species selection are some of the numerous bottlenecks to be circumvented by microalgae-based processes. The strategies suggested above on the microalgae use as an auxiliary tool for achieving sustainable development are assumed to be optimistic alternatives to encourage the race for sustainability (Efroymson et al., 2020 ). However, it is evident that there are still multiple hurdles that must be overcome to establish the relationship of microalgae with sustainable objectives. Among them, the limited investigation about sustainability criteria suggest there are still gaps that need to be filled. That is because declaring that a best practice for a local level is adequate for a global scale would be presumptuous. Therefore, recognizing the weaknesses of microalgae-based systems and emphasizing, through sustainability metrics and indicators, the limits imposed by the entire life cycle of the process is very fundamental to achieving greater and better sustainable global benefits.  3 Sustainability criteria and indicators for microalgae-based ingredients Measuring sustainability is the main challenge of the century. This is because the conceptual and operational difficulties surrounding sustainability promotion can only be overcome with the advancement of assessment models and methods (da Silva et al., 2020 ). Meanwhile, misconceptions about certain products and processes labeled as sustainable are widespread in current literature. No different, microalgae-based ingredients are often placed in the spotlight of industrial companies, attributing to sales marketing the appeal associated with sustainable superfoods and with promises to change the game as a future sustainable food solution rich in nutrients. But are microalgae-based ingredients really sustainable? To answer this question, it is necessary to go deeper into sustainability metrics and indicators. To date, sustainability-monitoring tools are structured into individual indicators correlated with their key dimensions. This means that there is no single indicator that assesses sustainability in a global context. What happens is that environmental, social, and economic indicators are assessed separately, and the difficulties of translating these results into a single score are far from being consolidated. Given these aspects, the advances achieved so far in sustainability indicators and metrics lie in mathematical modeling and research methodologies, which have developed into tools that estimate and quantify potential environmental and economic impacts. Today, the main environmental tools consist of a cluster of impact categories selected by life cycle assessment (LCA). Within this tool, it is possible to estimate, through a theoretical–experimental design, the potential impacts associated with ecological niches that encompass the potential for global warming, depletion of atmospheric layers, demand for water, energy, and land, beyond to attributes associated with the cycles biogeochemical, such as acidification and eutrophication of water or land resources (Jacob-Lopes et al., 2021 ). No different, economic tools such as Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) usually assess subcriteria such as capital cost and investment ratios, operating and maintenance costs, payback period, among others (Li et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, the most robust tools also cover technical criteria such as technological maturity, process efficiency, and global feasibility (Saraswat and Digalwar, 2021 ). By contrast, social indicators are still in their infancy. In fact, currently, few studies assess social criteria in-depth, largely as a result of their subjectivity. However, more complete studies usually include subcriteria such as social benefits, job creation, social acceptance, worker safety, in addition to potential impacts on worker health. In light of these storms’ conditions, it is desirable that the selection and use of indicators should be aligned with a sustainable development strategy that provides access to information on relevant dimensions and aspects in an integrated manner (da Silva et al., 2020 ). However, as this is not yet within our reach, the use of environmental sustainability indicators (ESIs), which provide clear and accurate information about conditions, trends, and changes in the environment, is the main focus of research (Fuentes et al., 2021 ). This is because although social, economic, and environmental indices have the same weight in the balance, it must be agreed that preserving the environment is essential to maintain the health of the planet and all living beings that live on it. Therefore, elucidating environmental issues and the possible impacts of processes and products under development has become the core of sustainability research. Therefore, in order to evolve in the path of sustainability of microalgae-based products and processes, the main ingredients from microalgal biomass were submitted to the LCA tool, and their environmental profiles were discussed in order to interrupt the assumptions that microalgae are products—today—environmentally sustainable. Compounds derived use from consolidated microalgae in the pharmaceutical and food industry is restricted to ingredients such as pigments, β-carotene, astaxanthin, and phycocyanin, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, ω-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, ω-3), beyond whole biomass as an alternative protein source. Thus, based on the analyses developed by Deprá et al. (2020b) , the main sustainability metrics associated with the environmental impacts of obtaining these ingredients were revised in order to obtain an overview of the sustainable concept of microalgae-based ingredients (Fig. 3  ). Microalgae-based products have high energy demands. By dividing the processes into upstream and downstream, we note that the environmental impacts associated with open cultivation systems correspond to 26% of the total, while the stages of harvesting, drying, and purification correspond to more than 74%, which is the case of ingredients such as β-carotene, phycocyanin, and total biomass from Chlorella vulgaris  and Arthrospira platensis  species. On the other hand, when the reaction core takes place in closed systems, that is, in photobioreactors and fermenters, where to originate lipid ingredients or even by the strains using more sensitive to external contaminants, the scenario is inverted. It is estimated that to be around 80% of the demands are associated with the cultivation stage, while only 20% are attributed to the downstream stages. Another important factor to be considered is the carbon dioxide emitted by the systems. Although microalgae are recognized for their high carbon fixation rates, it is evident that the higher demand for fossil energy—from coal—puts the advantages of microalgae-based systems to the test. Thus, much has been researched and discussed the inclusion of renewable energy systems, such as wind systems and photovoltaic panels, which could improve the energy scenario and, consequently, the environmental profile of these systems (Tafavogh and Zahedi, 2021 ). Not differently, the water demand of microalgal systems is a hotspot to be addressed. This is because microalgae are strictly aquatic. Thus, the demands for water resources are fundamental for its development and multiplication. However, the use of seawater, as well as integration approaches and rainwater harvesting, or even the optimization of systems with a high evaporation rate can be promising strategies to reduce this environmental barrier. Furthermore, the exploitation of microalgae cultures in effluents has been widely investigated. However, food safety criteria and other toxicological aspects are bottlenecks yet to be fulfilled (Buono et al., 2014 ). Given the intrinsic technological aspects of microalgae-based processes and products, it is important to emphasize that the energy-carbon-water nexus are essential bottlenecks that need to be elucidated. Undeniably, the nexus approach goes beyond demands and emissions because it involves understanding the interdependencies and linkages between water and energy at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In fact, water is needed for energy generation, and energy is needed for various processes related to extraction, treatment, purification, and distribution, and these, in turn, affect carbon emissions and contribute to environmental pollution (Bukhary et al., 2020 ). Therefore, finding solutions in an integrated way to assist in decision-making about the use and development of resources, and ensuring sustainability is not a problem associated with microalgae alone but with all global processes. Therefore, although microalgae are still promising sources to lead the global market, unfortunately, the level of technological maturity is low and the lack of economies of scale for processing is not yet competitive (Caporgno and Mathys, 2018 ). However, once these hurdles are outweighed, incorporating microalgae-based ingredients will not only bring health benefits but will also contribute to improving sustainability issues, taking into account population growth and our nutrition, habits, and human health.  4 Conclusions Microalgae clearly show potential to meet the population’s needs for more sustainable food solutions. Within a sustainable cycle, microalgae-based ingredients are a very valuable material, with several interesting and possible outcomes that need more careful evaluation, in addition to the currently known sustainability perspectives. Because, in their current state, the environmental impacts caused by these systems still put planetary boundaries at risk. Therefore, as we look to the future, the availability of new species, advances in cultivation techniques, and more efficient downstream processing cascades may offer a more viable approach. At the same time, the standardization and certification of sustainability characteristics as well as the consolidation of key criteria for a successful implementation of the circular economy and green marketing will be able to consider microalgae-based ingredients as sustainable products.
