                  In 2015 the United Nations created the Agenda for Sustainable Development and a list of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) for 2030. This year is the halfway mark toward meeting the goals, and the results reported by the World Health Organization in 2023 are not as positive as hoped, as progress has stagnated. The third SDG primarily focuses on the health and well-being of all ages to prevent unavoidable deaths in children aged < 5 years. Pediatric nurse practitioners are uniquely positioned to support programs building toward the health and well-being of children. Becoming aware of opportunities will help pediatric nurse practitioners use their voices toward success in meeting the SDGs.

KEY WORDS Global health  sustainable development goals  pediatrics    Eight years ago, country members of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly committed to working together, through the World Health Organization (WHO), toward 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) which, if realized, would improve health, wellness, and prosperity for all, but most importantly the poor, disadvantaged and marginalized (United Nations [UN], 2015 ; Figure 1  ). The SDGs were developed from the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, signed in 2015 as a call for action. Viewed together, the SDGs directly or indirectly affect the health of children worldwide; however, the third SDG most directly impacts the health of children to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages. The 17 SDGs are divided into 179 targets which outline and give direction to actions that will lead to success in meeting the goals. The targets are followed by indicators that demonstrate success in meeting the goals when achieved. There are nine targets for the third SDG, which aim to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages (Figure 2  ). The target most focused on children is 3.2:By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. (World Health Organization [WHO], 2021 , p. 41)   The indicators for SDG 3.2 targets are under five and neonatal mortality rates (WHO, 2021 ). The member states of the UN recognized the need to monitor and report the targets and indicators. A general report presented to the UN has been required every four years since the SDGs were agreed on in 2015. The secretary general of the UN appoints an independent body of scientists to gather the data, review the findings, and put it into context on the basis of social, developmental, and economic factors. The 2019 report was encouraging, with positive movement on several SDGs (UN, 2019 ). The 2023 scientist members are a diverse group from all over the world. The disciplines represented on the panel of scientists are primarily economists, sociologists, and math, social science, and climate change experts. The 2023 panel includes one physician who has an adult infectious disease background (UN, 2021 ). The need for input on how best to address goals that impact the health and well-being of infants, children, and their families is needed, with pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs) and pediatric-focused health care providers uniquely qualified to help guide the next stage of 2030. Ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being of children is not a new idea for PNPs or pediatric-focused providers. Our training and education have prepared us for this role in our communities (Buser & Taha, 2022 ). A recent literature review reported a clear role for the nursing profession in creating pathways for successfully attaining the goals (Fields et al., 2021 ). This paper will primarily review the third SDG, which most directly addresses the health of children. Attention will focus on where we are now, where we need to improve, and how PNPs can contribute toward attaining these goals for children worldwide. WHERE ARE WE NOW? The WHO has recently published the world health statistics report outlining health targets toward the SDGs (WHO, 2023 ). The global under-five mortality in 2000 was 76 deaths per 1,000 live births. By 2021, that number had dropped to 38 deaths per 1,000 live births. The improvement curve would have been expected to continue as we approached the second reporting time frame however, the global movement for all member countries to reach under 25 deaths per 1,000 deaths has not been reached (WHO, 2023 ). These findings indicate the success seen between 2015 and 2019 has slowed significantly. More than five million children aged < 5 years died in 2021 (WHO, 2021 ). For many countries, particularly in the African region, progress toward attaining their targets to reduce neonatal deaths and deaths for children aged < 5 years has slowed, and if aggressive measures are not taken now, they will not meet their target for 2030. In some countries, the mortality rate for children aged < 5 years is still more than 75 deaths per 1,000 births. The reasons for this change in course are unclear, but the COVID-19 pandemic and worsening climate change are factors (Bhutta et al., 2021 ). Countries with less than adequate health care systems experienced increased system stress starting in 2020 with overwhelming numbers of patients with Coronavirus illnesses. Worsening drought and heat have caused food shortages leading to insecurity and malnutrition. The number of children experiencing the effects of malnutrition, stunting, wasting, and obesity had decreased during the initial SDG years, but since 2019, improvement has stagnated. As occurred in the United States, children worldwide did not receive their scheduled vaccines and missed important primary care visits during the pandemic, and this may have contributed to a lack of forward movement toward reducing child mortality. The decrease in many of the areas of progress reported in 2019 had either stalled or worsened for most countries. If no improvement toward SDGs is made, it is estimated that 63 countries will not be able to meet their 2030 SDG targets. This number represents a potential 10 million avoidable deaths of children aged < 5 years (WHO, 2023 ).  WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE The 2023 health statistics review has highlighted the problems and areas needing more attention. Continued financial and personnel investments by governments focused on the world's children are required to mobilize countries toward their 2030 goals (Clark et al., 2020 ). We realize the health of children is complex, and mortalities for those aged < 5 years, although a reliable indicator, should not be viewed alone. The third SDG speaks to the health and well-being of all ages. A child who suffers from malnutrition and lack of medical care may survive to adulthood but with avoidable deficits: early death, development of noncommunicable disease, poor growth, and intellectual impairment leading to lost opportunity and cost (Global Nutrition Report, 2022 ). Helping children reach their sixth birthday and full potential requires a more focused approach to all the social determinants of health. A widened scope to include targets beyond mortality and including children aged > 5 years would be valuable to ensuring well-being at all ages (Alfvén, 2022 ; Simon et al., 2018 ).  HOW PNPS AND PEDIATRIC-FOCUSED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO MEETING THE SDGS BY 2030 The approach is not simple, but PNP's and pediatric-focused health care providers can do something to help achieve the third SDG goal of improving health and well-being for children and people of all ages. The first step is to become aware of the issues (Dossey et al., 2019 ). Know where your own country is on the path to the WHO SDGs. Another place to start might be to look at the countries in which your own family immigrated or your patients’ families immigrated from. Putting faces with the data is an important step in transitioning from looking at someone else's problem to having a personal involvement in helping to solve problems. Review a particular special area of interest and monitor the issues for that particular problem or indicator. For example, if children getting their scheduled vaccinations is very important to you, there is a special interest group at the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (2023)  that focuses on this topic, and you can join the discussion online. Find out what Shot@Life (2019)  is doing to promote vaccinations across the globe, and see where you can help. A simple call or letter to your federal congressional representative may help encourage legislation to fund global vaccination programs. If climate change is a concern for you, there are nursing organizations that focus on the planet and climate health, such as the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments (2023) . Encourage your professional nursing organization to play a larger role in promoting global health by submitting an abstract for presentation at a conference or writing a paper for a journal. If you are a nursing educator or researcher, your role toward the 2030 goalz can be to mentor and educate your students and colleagues on how important their voice is to global health (Dossey et al., 2019 ). You can encourage your students to participate in projects that help countries attain their goals or join letter-writing campaigns for health-related issues. Doctoral students should know how their advanced role is critical in the movement toward the health of children across the globe. Research projects should relate how the scholarly work sustains and promotes positive movement toward meeting the SDGs. Advanced practice registered nurses can put themselves forward to legislators and government committees as expert consultants on the health and well-being of children across the globe. Another positive move to help countries attain their SDGs is participating in local volunteer opportunities or traveling on medical missions. A recent Journal of Pediatric Health Care  article clearly outlines the opportunities to impact global health locally, including community involvement in climate change initiatives, contacting legislators about issues involving children, and preventing child trafficking (Buser & Taha, 2022 ). Traveling to foreign lands is an eye- and heart-opening experience for those who can. It is hard to ignore children suffering when you can see and feel it firsthand. There are many medical mission groups at teaching hospitals and universities, and nursing schools often have global health programs that take teams to various countries (UT Health San Antonio School of Nursing, 2023 ). Reach out to inquire if teams are seeking someone with your pediatric expertise on their next mission. When you find a mission, read and learn about the country you will be visiting. Where are they on reaching the SDGs? What barriers are they experiencing, and how might your team help them? The best mission trip is the one in which you are not arriving to show your foreign colleagues how smart you are or how much better you do things in your country. The best trip is when you leave smarter and are a better PNP because of what they have taught you. Our foreign colleagues want you to share your protocols and knowledge but with the expectation that they will make changes on the basis of what resources they have available and what is feasable in their health care delivery environment. Promoting protocols such as infection prevention may decrease avoidable deaths for children under five and will move them toward their SDG goals. Helping our world neighbors attain health and well-being for children is worth every moment you volunteer.  CONCLUSIONS In 2023, we are halfway in the 15-year path for SDG 2030. Improvement has slowed, and success will require intense involvement from our world leaders, governments, nongovernmental organizations, professional organizations, and you. As experts in pediatric care, PNPs, and pediatric-focused providers, we are in a unique position to find our seat at the table as data are reviewed, decisions are made, and work is done to improve the health and well-being of children around the world. Do not delay; join a group, use your voice, write a letter, and take a trip to help the world ensure healthy lives and well-being for all ages.   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST None to report.
