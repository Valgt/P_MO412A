                  The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) serve as a comprehensive framework guiding humanity's response to various pressing challenges. Using fossil fuels presents a significant environmental challenge due to the release of greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy satisfies the expanding energy demands and mitigates climate change. Moreover, solar energy has a significant potential on a global scale for energy production. Solar photovoltaics (PV) technology, from utility-scale megaprojects to modest residential installations, is becoming more affordable and investment-worthy worldwide while providing customers with higher efficiency per watt. Due to the absence of a comparative study of the largest solar PV power plants, studies are subject to set inputs on the impact of these power plants and contributions in relation to the SDGs. The present study has two main objectives, i.e., a comparison of the largest solar PV power plants globally and an analysis of the contribution of solar PV power plants to the SDGs. The study also explores the alignment of solar PV power plants with SDG 7, emphasizing affordable and clean energy access. Solar energy is a powerful driver for achieving SDG 13, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and diminishing reliance on fossil fuels. Beyond environmental impacts, solar PV power plants contribute to economic growth, innovation, and job creation, aligning with SDG 8. This research would provide valuable insights into the global social, economic, and environmental dimensions of solar PV power plants.

Graphical abstract       The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) serve as a comprehensive framework guiding humanity's response to various pressing challenges. Using fossil fuels presents a significant environmental challenge due to the release of greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy satisfies the expanding energy demands and mitigates climate change. Moreover, solar energy has a significant potential on a global scale for energy production. Solar photovoltaics (PV) technology, from utility-scale megaprojects to modest residential installations, is becoming more affordable and investment-worthy worldwide while providing customers with higher efficiency per watt. Due to the absence of a comparative study of the largest solar PV power plants, studies are subject to set inputs on the impact of these power plants and contributions in relation to the SDGs. The present study has two main objectives, i.e., a comparison of the largest solar PV power plants globally and an analysis of the contribution of solar PV power plants to the SDGs. The study also explores the alignment of solar PV power plants with SDG 7, emphasizing affordable and clean energy access. Solar energy is a powerful driver for achieving SDG 13, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and diminishing reliance on fossil fuels. Beyond environmental impacts, solar PV power plants contribute to economic growth, innovation, and job creation, aligning with SDG 8. This research would provide valuable insights into the global social, economic, and environmental dimensions of solar PV power plants.   Keywords SDGs  Renewable energy  Utility-scale projects  Solar energy  PV   Data availability Data will be made available on request.   1 Introduction Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned for energy, one of the leading causes of climate change. This emphasizes the critical need to switch to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, etc., to limit the impact of fossil fuels. Renewable energy has recently played an important part in creating numerous worldwide technologies [1,2] . It has become one of the most significant energy sources for electricity generation without using fossil fuels. Fig. 1   demonstrates the sources of energy. Using renewable energy decreases pollutants and averts global warming. Solar energy technology is one of the most significant renewable energy resources. It produces clean power while significantly reducing CO2  emissions [3,4,5] . Fig. 2   illustrates the installed solar energy capacity worldwide. The electricity generated from solar energy increased from 72 GW in 2011 to 850 GW in 2021 [6] . This increment in generated electricity shows the upward trend in solar energy technology, even with the disruption caused by COVID-19 in recent years. The increasing growth and economic development worldwide increase the demand for solar energy. Thus, solar energy has significant potential for applications in different areas with high levels of global solar radiation every year [7,8] . Various strategies are being researched to make solar energy more technologically and economically viable. Solar PV energy is distinguished by its high reliability, quiet operation, and low maintenance. Because of the flexibility of PV electricity, the generated power ranges from milliwatts to gigawatts. PV harnesses solar energy for large-scale, domestically secure, and environmentally friendly power generation [6,10,11] . Hence, software tools that can determine the potential energy production characteristics and operating performance of PV systems are required [12,13] . Solar PV power plants provide vital environmental insights by deploying clean and economical energy sources instead of conventional fossil fuel power plants, which are still widely employed worldwide [14] . These tools will evaluate the performance and cost of energy generation of various system configurations [15] . Many authors have addressed the environmental performance of photovoltaic systems with life cycle assessment studies and efficiency improvements in converting solar cell devices in recent research on solar PV energy [16–19] . Other current research fields [20–24]  have provided guidelines for comparing solar PV technology to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition to the absence of a comparative study of the largest solar PV power plants, studies are subject to set inputs on the impact of these power plants and contributions. The present study has two main objectives, i.e., a comparison of the largest solar PV power plants globally and an analysis of the contribution of the role of solar PV power plants to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To achieve these two objectives, this study started by giving a brief background on solar energy and then focusing on solar PV power plants. Solar PV power plants support human development by facilitating access to essential services, improving human health, and supporting income generation activities. Solar PV power plants may also contribute to sustainable economic growth by generating economic benefits such as job creation and industrial development. A thorough investigation was presented for each power plant to demonstrate such linkages. This research examined the largest thirteen solar power plants in 2024. Given the time required to establish such power plants, this study can be valid for many years. Also, this study provides valuable insights into the global social, economic, and environmental dimensions of solar PV power plants.  2 Background on solar energy Solar energy is one of the most environmentally friendly sources that does not contribute to global warming. It is used for electricity production and heating systems, and it is also used in the desalination field [25,26] . Applications of solar energy are shown in Fig. 3  . One of the critical aspects for achieving the desired improvement in the quality of life is the availability of cheap and abundant energy with minimal environmental and ecological impacts connected with its production and usage [27–29] . The increasing scarcity of fossil fuels has increased the global interest in capturing solar energy. Solar power is a kind of energy with significant future potential, even though it now meets just a small percentage of the world's energy consumption [30–32] . Fig. 4   shows the solar energy potential worldwide. It is worth pointing out that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has a vast potential yet to be utilized [33] . Global Solar Atlas reported that 93 percent of the world population resides in nations with an average daily PV potential of 3 to 5 measured in kilowatt-hours per installed kilowatt peak (kWh/kWp) [34] . Furthermore, countries in the favorable mid-range of 3.5 to 4.5 kWh/kWp account for 71 % of the worldwide population [34] . A comparison of the actual potential in addition to socioeconomic reveals new insights. Despite the richness and distribution of other renewable resources, such as wind power, the worldwide spread of solar power has gained substantial attention [35,36] . As a result, solar energy has far outpaced many other renewable energy technologies. In terms of overall cumulative size, the emerging market for solar power has exceeded additional renewable energy markets [3,37] . Fig. 5   shows the types of solar energy conversion technologies. Several works have been conducted on the optimal sizing of PV systems [38] , solar tracking systems [39] , cooling systems for PV systems [40] , and prediction of photovoltaic maximum current [41] . Furthermore, Wang et al. [42]  investigated the efficacy of the peak shaving auxiliary services in a hybrid solar PV system. Their system showed the ability to optimize planning and dispatch, which helps reduce electricity costs and enhance grid reliability. Kee et al. [43]  developed a model for small scale CSP system with thermal energy storage to minimize the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and maximize the capacity factor (CF). When comparing optimistic and pessimistic power block cost assumptions, the ideal LCOE ranged from 122.7 USD/MWhe to 217.8 USD/MWhe. Also, [44]  studied capacity optimization for PV-hydrogen hybrid systems to maximize the annual profit of the system. The findings showed that when PV physical modeling is applied, a 1-MW PV plant needs a transformer of 226.9 kW, electrolyzers of 366.8 kW, and three compressors. The LCOE was 0.03 $/kWh, the levelized cost of hydrogen was 2.9 $/kg, and the payback period was 11 years. An accurate estimation of the levelized energy cost is necessary with such vital investments. These data are critical in the design, size, selection of equipment, and prediction of the performance of these power generation units. In this context, high accuracy in statistics is necessary for developing and implementing solar PV systems and decreasing financial risks [45–47] . Solar energy plants may require incentives and financial facilities compared to traditional energy production facilities due to high investment costs. Several regulatory tools and support mechanisms assist in increasing the number of solar power systems installed in Chile, for example [48] . Solar energy power plants significantly implement the 2030 agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) globally [49–52] . Energy security, affordability, domestic benefits, and poverty reduction are the top priorities of solar PV power plant implementation. One of the solar energy targets is to eliminate poverty in rural areas and provide an alleviated strategy targeted for the poverty [53–56] .  3 Comparison of mega solar PV power plants Solar PV possesses properties and is likely the most prevalent energy source. Every day of the year, outside the polar rings, sunlight falls on the whole world. Fig. 6   shows the largest solar PV power plants worldwide ranked according to their size. This section reviews different solar PV power plants in the world. An effort was made to decrease the subjectivity of the data by sourcing information and numbers from published documents. Through this, any potential subjective biases of the findings can be reduced. 3.1 Mohammed Bin Rashid solar park (United Arab Emirates) The Mohammed bin Rashid Solar Park (MBRSP) is one of the largest single-site solar installations worldwide; the ambitious project is in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It consists of multiple phases to achieve 5000 MW by 2030 of clean energy produced by solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power. This major power plant is being led by the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA). Several stages have been fully operationalized and commissioned. MBRSP is a huge milestone for Dubai’s commitment to sustainable energy and helps reduce its carbon footprint [24,57] .  3.2 Al Dhafra solar plant (United Arab Emirates) The two-gigawatt project will be around 35 km outside Abu Dhabi and provide electricity to the plant's off-taker, Emirates Water and Electricity Company [58] . Once operational, the Al Dhafra Solar Plant IPP will use over 4 million solar panels to provide enough electricity for almost 160,000 homes throughout the UAE, making it the world's largest single-site solar power plant. Every year, 2.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be reduced. The facility will use the most recent crystalline, bifacial solar technology, which will produce energy at the highest efficiency and allow the facility more power by exploiting both the front and back of panels [59,60] .  3.3 Noor Abu Dhabi solar plant (United Arab Emirates) Noor —the Arabic word for light— Abu Dhabi is the largest single-site solar power facility near Abu Dhabi in Sweihan, with 3.2 million solar panels. Ninety thousand people in Abu Dhabi receive renewable electricity from the facility. The solar panels are cleaned by a robotic system that doesn't need water. Every day, the robots clean it across 1600 km. The Abu Dhabi National Energy Company subsidiary, Sweihan Power Company, runs it [61,62] . It is a partnership between the Abu Dhabi Government and a group that includes Jinko Solar Holding in China and Marubeni Corporation in Japan.  3.4 Solar star plant (United States) The Solar Star projects are two co-located photovoltaic (PV) solar installations in the United States close to Rosamond, California. They were initially known as the Antelope Valley solar projects. The 579 MW Solar Star power plant is the largest running solar generating facility in the US and is owned and operated by BHE Solar, a division of BHE Renewables. It was also the largest solar power station in the world when it was first put into operation in 2015. SunPower Corporation first took on the Solar Star projects. In December 2012, SunPower sold the project to BHE Renewables, a division of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Energy [63,64] . However, SunPower was kept on as the project's engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor. The Solar Star installations are situated in southern California's Antelope Valley, which serves as the westernmost point of the Mojave Desert. About 13 km2  of privately held property in the northern and southern parts of Los Angeles County and Kern County are home to the PV solar arrays. The area was chosen because it has excellent solar resources and seldom rains. Two distinct installations, Solar Star-1 and Solar Star-2, with capacities of 314 MW and 265 MW, comprise the Solar Star power plant. The 265 MW Solar Star-2 project is in Kern County, while the 314 MW Solar Star-1 complex is spread throughout Kern and Los Angeles Counties. The power plant comprises 1.72 million PV solar modules installed on single-axis trackers. These modules monitor the sun's path to produce solar power as efficiently as possible. The project included the construction of about 137 km of new roadways [65,64] .  3.5 Bhadla solar park (India) A 2.25GW solar complex called Bhadla Solar Park was built in the Rajasthani hamlet of Bhadla in the Jodhpur area. The project is constructed in four parts, with the first two phases developed by Rajasthan Solar Park Development Company Limited (RSPDCL), the third phase developed by Saurya Urja Company of Rajasthan, and the fourth phase developed by Adani Renewable Energy Park Rajasthan. The project’s cost is around $1.4 billion in total. The power plant’s construction began in 2015, and its final phase was implemented in 2018. Rajasthan has the maximum sun irradiation at 5.72 kWh/m2 /day, making it the ideal location for constructing solar parks [65–69] . The nation also benefits from having a 142GW maximum solar power potential on enormous tracts of inexpensive, arid land. Over 10 million solar panels are installed over all the sites to achieve the 2.25 GW generation capacity; these solar panels are cleaned using robots, which humans handle and monitor.  3.6 Pavagada solar park (India) The Pavagada Solar Park, located in the Tumkur district of Karnataka, is one of the biggest solar power stations in India and the world. Establishing this central solar park was done by Karnataka Solar Power Development Corporation (KSPDCL), which is a joint venture between two companies, Karnataka Renewable Energy Development (KREDL) and Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI), which happened in 2015, to develop the 2,050 MW solar park. The Government of Karnataka granted clearance for the $2.2 billion mega solar power project in October 2015, and construction began in October 2016. The solar park as a whole was put into operation in December 2019 after completing the 600 MW first phase of the project in January 2018. This substantial solar park covers 53 km2  in the Pavagada taluk of the Tumkur district. KSPDCL acquired this land for the solar park by lease agreements on a yearly lease rental basis with the farmers. The Pavagada solar park consists of eight PV installation segments, each having a rated capacity of 250 MW. Each section is then split into five blocks, each with a capacity of 50 MW. A 220 kV pooling substation receives the power produced by each solar park block through 66 kV/33 kV double-circuit subterranean wires. The 400 kV/220 kV substation in Pavagada, owned and operated by the Power Grid Corporation India (PGCIL), is connected to the pooling substation. The Pavagada substation is further linked to a 400 kV substation in Mysore and another in Tumkur at Vasantnarsapur [70] .  3.7 Longyangxia Dam solar park (China) In China, renewable energy is a booming industry. A nation that has led the world in greenhouse gas emissions for more than ten years and where coal-fired power has long dominated the energy mix has recently embraced renewable energy sources. The government has made progress toward its lofty goals for expanding generation from cleaner fuel sources and decreasing its dependency on coal-fired electricity thanks to the Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, a component of a hydro-solar integration in the high desert on the Tibetan Plateau. Solar plants can supply electricity to 200,000 homes. Power Investment Cooperation, one of China's top five power providers, runs the Longyangxia Dam Solar Park in the Qinghai region in northwest China. Longyangxia is a gigantic power plant that cost around 6 billion yuan ($889.7 million) to build and has been expanding practically continuously since construction started in 2013. It can produce 850 MW of power, enough to power up to 200,000 houses. About 4 million solar panels had been installed across 27 km2  of Qinghai province [71–73] .  3.8 Tengger desert solar park (China) Tengger Desert Solar Park, which covers an area of 43 km2  in the open desert and provides electricity to more than 600,000 homes, was built at a never-before-seen scale, allowing China to have access to 1.5 GW of additional solar power capacity, earning it the distinction of being the largest photovoltaic power facility in the world in terms of both size and output when it was finished in 2015. The Tengger facility's completion assisted in raising China's installed solar capacity above 176 GW. With over 32 % of the world's installed capacity, the nation is one of the top in that category. Tengger's 1.5 GW capacity does not guarantee that all energy is utilized [74–77] . Although most Chinese citizens reside in the east, most of the nation's vast solar parks are located in the northwest, in desert regions with low electricity consumption. The transmission of power generated in these remote locations to where it may be utilized has some significant technical challenges.  3.9 Benban solar park (Egypt) One of the largest solar complexes in Africa is Benban Solar Power Park. The Benban project launched a regional revolution in renewable energy and put Egypt on the map for solar energy. Over 37 km2  of land make up Benban, which is situated in the Aswan Desert. It produced 1.5 GW of power. The Egyptian government divided the site into 41 plots, which were then allocated to 30 developers from 12 nations, including Spain's Acciona, Alcazar Energy in the United Arab Emirates, Italy's Enerray, France's Total Enren and EDF, China's Chint Solar, and Norway's Scatec, through financial incentives known as “feed-in tariffs,” where the government guarantees the developers a fixed price for the electricity generated for 25 years. Benban was connected to Egypt's National Grid in 2019, generating enough power for 420,000 homes and saving 423,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) values Egypt's Benban solar power facility at $4 billion [78–81] .  3.10 Noor solar power (Morocco) Morocco's largest concentrated solar power plant project is the Noor Power Plant. The Noor plants are located in a highly advantageous area with one of the highest quantities of sunshine in the world (2635 kWh/m2 /year) in the municipality of Ouarzazate in the Agadir province of Morocco. The Ouarzazate complex delivers over 500 MW of power with several utility-scale solar power units utilizing different solar technologies. The 160 MW Noor I plant is the first one in this complex, and it uses three hours of thermal energy storage to provide electricity during the nighttime peak hours. Noor II utilizes parabolic trough CSP technology, has a 200 MW capacity, and is constructed with 7 h of storage. The third project is the 150 MW Noor III CSP Project, a greenfield IPP. The three initiatives enclose 25 km2 . Noor I was formally commissioned in February 2016 after phase one building work began in August 2013. In 2019, Noor II and Noor III began supplying the grid with sustainable energy. The Noor I CSP plant created around 1,000 construction jobs and 60 permanent jobs during the operation and maintenance phase, and it offsets 240,000 tons of CO2  emissions annually. The Noor II and Noor III plants reduce annual CO2  emissions by 533,000 t. The technology licensor for the three plants is Sener. Sener's unique SENERtrough cylindrical parabolic troughs are installed in Noor I, SENERtrough-2 parabolic trough collectors are incorporated in Noor II, and central tower technology with salt receivers is utilized in Noor III. While other plants use a dry cooling system, Noor I employs a wet cooling system. The Mansour Eddabhi dam, about 12 km from the project site, will supply the water needed for the plants, which will be kept in water storage reservoirs with a combined capacity of 300,000 m3 . Noor II has 400 loops and a surface area of around 6.12 km2 . Each loop consists of four linked solar collector assembly (SCA) modules, including 12 solar collector element (SCE) modules. Noor III spans around 5.98 km2  of land [82–84] .  3.11 Núñez de Balboa Spain solar plant (Spain) Through a Spanish subsidiary, the Iberdrola group constructed the Nez de Balboa solar project in Badajoz, making it one of the biggest in Europe with a 500 MW installed capacity and the ability to power 250,000 households. The plant, which has a 500 MW installed capacity (391 MW of maximum grid connection capacity), provides clean electricity to 250,000 homes, which is more than the combined populations of Cáceres and Badajoz, and prevents the release of 215,000 tonnes of CO2  into the environment each year. The 1,430,000 photovoltaic panels at Nez de Balboa, which has a surface area of almost 10 km2  and a total weight of 12,100 metric tons, generate around 832 GWh annually. They are mounted on 288,000 ground mounts. The total cost of the project is around €300 million ($340 m), with purchases totaling €227 M from about 30 suppliers who participated in the construction, supply of photovoltaic modules, the fixed structure, inverters, transformers, and the civil works and engineering of the electrical lines and substation, this project has revitalized the local industrial fabric and created local jobs. This solar plant employed more than 1,200 people, a record amount generated due to the work, with 70 % going to people from Extremadura [85–87] .  3.12 Neuhardenberg solar power plant (Germany) The largest photovoltaic power project in Germany and one of the biggest solar power plants in the world right now is the Neuhardenberg solar power plant. It is located in Neuhardenberg's Oderbruchstraße on a former military airstrip site. The plant's 145 MW installed capacity allows it to produce 19.69 million kWh of renewable electricity annually, enough to power 48,000 households and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by around 12,700 t annually. 60,000 Talesun TP660P solar panels with a maximum power output of 235 W–240 W and an efficiency of 14.5 %–14.8 % make up this enormous structure. The plant employs Skytron Energy's Skycontrol PV controller, which has several technological features. This sophisticated technology not only enhances and ensures energy stability but also regulates the adjustment settings for transferring the electricity generated by the plant to the grid. This technology combines ABB PV800 inverters, 985 Diehl Ako 22,000 TL inverters, and KACO XP500 inverters into a single, unified control system to increase the facility's efficiency. The 145 MW solar power plant's financing came from a $365 million loan agreement. SUISSE BANK supplied the necessary guarantees, and Enerparc, Ecos-energy, BaySolar, and MEP Asset Management provided equity financing for the power plant [88–91] .  3.13 Setouchi Kirei Mega solar power plant (Japan) A 235 MW solar power plant called Setouchi Kirei Solar Park is in Okayama, Japan. The project is currently operational and has undergone a single development period. The project was commissioned in October 2018 once construction was finished. Chudenko and Toyo Engineering designed the project, which is owned by Chudenko, GE Energy Financial Services, Kuni Umi Asset Management, and Toyo Engineering. The ground-mounted solar project Setouchi Kirei Solar Park spans 2.65 km2 . The initiative reduces carbon dioxide emissions (CO2 ) by 192,000 t annually while providing sustainable electricity for 80,000 families. $965 million was spent on the project with a power purchase agreement to sell the power produced by the plant to Chugoku Electric Power for a 20-year term; the electricity is sold at a rate of $0.351 per kWh, with a contracted capacity of 186 MW [92,93] . Table 1   summarizes the solar PV power plants discussed in this section.   4 Discussion on sustainable development goals and solar PV plants Section 4  discusses the SDGs and the impact of solar PV power plants from environmental, social, and economic aspects. Solar energy may boost trade, lower the cost of fuel imports, and drive capital investment. Fig. 7   displays the benefits of solar energy on the sustainability pillars. There are numerous challenges that humanity is facing due to sustainability transformation. Sustainable development “is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” [101] . The main aim of the SDGs is to eliminate discrimination and inequality, end poverty, and overcome climate change by 2030 [102] . All United Nations members adopted the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 as a universal goal to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that people live in peace and prosperity by 2030. These SDGs are officially adopted by 193 countries at the Sustainable Development Summit. The SDGs comprise 17 goals and 169 targets related to sustainable development in terms of overall economic, environmental, and social aspects. Each set goal written by the United Nations has a title, description, and detailed list of targets and indicators that cover the specific purpose of the goal [103,104] . Although implementing the SDGs requires various approaches, they must be measured and monitored. In light of this, countries are encouraged to promote sustainability and renewable energy sources for energy generation [105] . Solar energy plays a direct role in achieving the SDGs, especially in climate action, affordable and clean energy, and sustainable cities and communities [52,106] . Implementing plans and policy tools for applying solar energy will be crucial for fostering sustainable economic growth and improving the quality of life, particularly in rural areas. Güney [107]  investigated the real impact of solar energy on the SDGs based on data from 35 countries from 2005 to 2018. The study confirmed that prioritizing solar energy helps advance sustainable development and enables countries to take positive steps to achieve the SDGs. Economic, social, and environmental pillars are the three dimensions of sustainable growth. Raising all people's living standards is essential to achieve sustainable development. While also reducing the pollution of the resources utilized to meet the rising energy demand. Compared to non-renewable energy, renewable energy has a more significant impact on sustainable development. In other words, the potential of achieving the 2030 targets set by the UN is increased along with the countries' use of renewable energy. As a result, Güney [108]  highlighted the significance of countries' usage of renewable energy for sustainable development. Moreover, the breakdown of the SDGs based on sustainability pillars is shown in Fig. 8  . 4.1 Environmental impact of solar energy Solar energy, as a sustainable energy source, is crucial in lowering greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change, which is critical for preserving people, wildlife, and ecosystems. Solar energy helps to enhance air quality and minimize water consumption associated with the energy generation [109,110] . Shahsavari [3]  observed that solar energy offers exceptional environmental benefits and the capacity to address the issue of energy poverty, which may play a critical part in achieving diversified energy security in the future. Around the world, many countries have also explored the environmental benefits of solar PV power plants, such as Africa [52] , the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) [111] , China [112] , India [113] , Palestine [114,115] . Fig. 9   shows the environmental benefits of solar PV power plants. To mitigate any potential environmental impacts, there is a need to study the sustainability level of each phase of solar energy and evaluate the ecological impacts of each technology. Much literature has been published on the environmental effects of solar energy fields [116–119] . These studies examined the current practices and observed the future potential for further reduction in carbon emissions. In an investigation into policy formulation involving the recycling of waste solar panels, Chowdhury, et al. [120]  suggested that the number of end-of-life panels will need the development of a recycling and recovery plan by 2040. This is found based on the rapid expansion in installed PV generation capacity. Recycling solar PV waste might cut CO2  emissions, having a significant favorable influence on the environment [4,120–122] . As a result, this analysis examined the need for solar PV recycling regulations by analyzing existing recycling methods [122–124] . The phases of solar energy projects, whether PV or Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), will undergo a series of steps. The lifecycle of a solar PV power plant consists of the project phase, operation and maintenance, and end-of-life phase, as illustrated in Fig. 10  . According to [125–128] , solar panels have a life expectancy of approximately 30 years before decommissioning. A 20 % decrease in power capacity may occur throughout the life of solar panels. The highest decline in efficiency is 10 % within the first 10 to 12 years and 20 % after reaching 25 years.  4.2 Social impact of solar energy There needs to be more awareness of the social benefits of solar PV power plant. In many places in Africa, the public is more concerned with practical issues affecting people's livelihoods and physical health [129–132] . The benefits of low-carbon energy development are increased employment rates, a boosted local economy, and improved living standards for the public [54,133,134] . Solar PV power plants create job opportunities for all social classes and develop a modern rooftop household PV facility that aids residents in rural areas [135–138] . Fig. 11   shows the social benefits of employing solar PV power plants. Furthermore, the significant aesthetic impact would be minimal in comparison to the overall advantages gained by society. Large-scale solar PV power plants are installed in locations with low population densities. Forests and areas of remarkable natural beauty are also avoided [139,140] . Similarly, noise is minimal compared to other power sources, including conventional, wind, and gas turbines [141,142] . The noise from large-scale systems' generating plants is unlikely to cause any disturbance to the public. Central tower solar systems can concentrate light to levels that harm eyesight. Under normal operating conditions, this should provide no risk to operators; nevertheless, failure of the tracking systems might result in straying beams, which could pose an occupational safety issue on-site [143,144] . However, there will be some job opportunities throughout the solar energy system's development and operation [145] . Several authors have reported an analysis of the social impacts of solar energy that demonstrated overall improvement in residents' social status and living standards in the area [146–152] . Sharma, et al. [150]  showed the impact of the solar home lighting system, which is significant to the performance of school-going children. Thus, many beneficiaries have reported that using solar lights is essential and improves their children’s education [151–156] . Correspondingly, PV manufacturers should be given additional responsibility for decreasing the toxic and hazardous compounds used in producing PV modules [120,154,155] . Manufacturers should take good care of end-of-life treatment to ensure solar modules/components/materials can be reused, recycled, or recovered [156,157] . The authorities should provide additional incentives, finances, and infrastructure to encourage the implementation of large-scale PV installations [158] . More awareness and training initiatives should be established to enhance the social acceptance of solar PV installations. Many papers have shown their concerns about the aesthetic impact of solar energy fields [159–162] . Sánchez-Pantoja, et al. [139]  affirmed that different European initiatives are now unconcerned with their aesthetic influence on cities or the social impression evaluation. It is preferable to think of technology as an integrated core component of work and everyday life that leads to more significant benefits and promotes the implementation of renewable energy.  4.3 Economic impact of solar energy Diversifying the national energy grid through solar energy technologies fosters sustainable economic growth and improves the quality of life, particularly in rural areas. This will rely heavily on implementing government strategies and policy instruments to use solar energy. In the worldwide market, solar PV technology is a competitive and economically developed [163,164] . Given Africa's strategically vital position in global politics and economy, the continent has been a center of attention for many countries throughout the world [133,165] . Also, solar PV power plants will allow the use of underused or no longer usable land, with a net benefit that does not burden existing infrastructure. Liao and Fei [166]  findings revealed that countries are executing photovoltaic power plants, and the main restricting factors include poor infrastructure, limited population, and low economic activity in rural regions. In another study, Zaman, et al. [167]  studied the role of solar energy as a safety net during the COVID-19 pandemic. Solar energy has provided poor rural households in remote and difficult-to-reach areas access to energy. These safety net programs should be maintained with emphasis on their potential to assist people in resilient livelihoods. Local energy power plants meet economic and climate change goals, supply clean energy to isolated areas, and provide social benefits, such as access to jobs and energy resources. For example, in the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Rashid Solar Park has helped to develop economic activities such as job creation and decreased power expenditures [24] . Solar energy is competitive with coal, oil, gas, and other carbon-generating resources [168,169] . Fig. 12   shows the economic benefits of solar energy concerning the energy market, land use and infrastructure, public benefit, industry, research, and development. It is worth noting that there is no one-size-fits-all policy solution for the solar energy system to maximize its value. Many interconnected viewpoints relate to the socio-economic benefits of exploiting solar energy. These benefits include greater regional and national energy independence, energy supply diversification and security, and support for energy market trade. The cost of solar panels is decreasing, and the demand for renewable energy is increasing. These two factors have led to an increase in affordability for solar PV power plants. Thus, utility-scale power plants are becoming more affordable than modest residential installations. Solar PV power plants are a form of renewable energy that is helping the world reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Solar energy plants have a significant impact on the environment and society. They provide clean and renewable energy and are a great source of employment for different people. Table 2   comprehensively summarizes the major solar PV power plants, incorporating data extracted using a greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator [170] . Furthermore, researchers analyzed each power plant covered in this study from diverse perspectives. Table 3   showcases the various fields of study covered for these power plants. Based on Table 2 , Fig. 13   illustrates the economic, environmental, and social impact of each solar energy plant provided. Furthermore, Table 4   shows the contribution of solar PV power plants to each SDG. For instance, access to essential energy services and making electricity accessible is directly related to target 7.1, which ensures universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. Also, target 7.2 states the need to increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Food security is enhanced by solar energy, which provides refrigeration and food preservation. In addition, providing clean energy while lowering pollutants helps achieve target 7.2. Ensuring everyone has access to sufficient power for food preservation helps achieve SDG 2 of Zero Hunger, target 2.1. Sustainable energy practices promote food security and nutrition by ensuring year-round food availability, especially for vulnerable populations. Similarly, improving agriculture is directly related to target 2.3, which aims to double agricultural productivity, which promotes ending hunger and sustainable agriculture. Moreover, providing access to the internet directly contributes to SDG 9, target 9.2c, which states an increase in information and communication technology. This enhances the infrastructure and fosters industrialization for the coming generation. In addition, enabling women to work after the dark provides equal rights to women to economic resources and access to ownership, which is directly related to SDG 5, target 5. a. It also contributes to SDG 7 target 7.1, ensuring everyone can access electricity. Furthermore, increasing employment directly relates to SDG 8, target 8.5, which entails achieving full and productive employment, decent work for all, and equal pay. In line with SDG 8, the development of jobs is a crucial component of encouraging decent work and economic growth. This aim focuses a strong emphasis on the creation of jobs, sustainable economic growth, and fair working conditions for all people. Furthermore, several new local businesses will form by introducing a new market. This directly relates to SDG 8, target 8.3, which promotes productive activities, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation development. Thus, solar PV power plants contribute to the three pillars of sustainable development, with the economic pillar impacted by job creation and supporting economic development in the country. Providing access to energy positively impacts communities, including homes, schools, and healthcare facilities, which aids the social pillar. Ultimately, solar PV power plants provide clean energy, which helps mitigate climate change SDG 13 and supports responsible consumption and production SDG 12 under the umbrella of the environmental pillar. Because solar energy makes sustainable power sources accessible, it substantially contributes to achieving SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy. The broad implementation of this technology contributes to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing reliance on fossil fuels, hence supporting the goals of Climate Action SDG 13.   5 Conclusion This paper explored the state of solar photovoltaic projects worldwide. The findings provide insight into solar PV power plants currently in the pipeline and those that have been completed. Solar PV power plants support human development by facilitating access to essential services, improving human health, and supporting income generation activities. Solar PV power plants may also contribute to sustainable economic growth by generating economic benefits such as job creation and industrial development. A thorough investigation was presented for each power plant to demonstrate such linkages, providing insight into solar PV plants that aim to decentralize electricity, minimize energy poverty, and fulfill the SDGs. These plants contribute to sustainable economic growth through job creation, local business support, and entrepreneurship. This aligns with various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as No Poverty (SDG 1), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9), and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10). From a social perspective, solar PV power plants facilitate access to essential energy services, powering homes, schools, and healthcare facilities. They contribute significantly to achieving SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and address social goals related to Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Quality Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5), and Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6). On the environmental front, solar PV power plants have a direct impact on SDGs like Affordable Clean Energy (SDG 7), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12), and Climate Action (SDG 13). By mitigating climate change and promoting clean energy, these plants align with responsible consumption practices (SDG 12) and contribute to goals related to Life Below Water (SDG 14) and Life on Land (SDG 15). Looking ahead, the focus should extend to decentralizing electricity, minimizing energy poverty, and aligning solar PV power plants with the broader Sustainable Development Goals. The economic, social, and environmental pillars of sustainability offer a comprehensive framework for evaluating the impact of solar PV power plants, emphasizing their potential to drive positive change on a global scale.
