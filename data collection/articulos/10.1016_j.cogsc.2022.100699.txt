                  Lignin, as an abundant natural polymer with interesting mechanical, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, has the possibility to produce numerous chemicals and biofuels of current interest. However, the structural recalcitrance, heterogeneity, and complex extraction methods of lignin can hinder its transformation into value-added materials. Therefore, the research community is exploring innovative bioconversion technologies capable of effectively valorizing lignin. Thus, effective bioconversion and deconstruction methods have been recently studied. In this review, we first define lignin as a versatile raw material considering its characteristics, properties, and abundance. Then, lignin valorization is described in terms of the current opportunities and technical challenges. Finally, we discuss the industrial potential of lignin-derived products such as biofuels, biopolymers, biopesticides, and fertilizers. Those lignin-derived products are highly valuable for the energy and food industries, which are two main sectors challenged by the rapid growth of population, urbanization, and consumption. Thus, progress on lignin valorization would represent significant advancements in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and circular economy aspects.

Lignocellulose biomass is composed of 44–50% cellulose, 28–31% hemicellulose, and 15–25% lignin [2 ] (Figure 1  ). The role of lignin in plants is to provide mechanical support, provide physical barriers to pathogens, facilitate fluids transport, and provide strength to the plants; therefore, lignin plays a fundamental role in plant functioning. Other components of lignocellulose include cellulose (44–50%), hemicellulose (28–31%), and some trace compounds including inorganic materials, terpenoids, chlorophyll, pectin, and proteins [3 ]. The potential exploitation of lignin as raw material relies on the 20 × 109  tons of lignin produced each year by the conversion of environmental carbon through photosynthesis processes [4 ]. Basically, lignin is a type of complex aromatic polymer formed by cross-linking of various aromatic building blocks usually conjugated with hemicellulose and cellulose. The mechanical strength provided by lignin has been demonstrated with wood possessing high lignin content, thus, better durability [5 ]. In addition, lignin can produce around 26.6 kJ/g heat when used as fuel, which is a higher energy value in comparison to cellulose. Lignin biosynthesis is regulated by the phenylpropanoid pathway, being phenylalanine as the main substrate, which is generated through the shikimate pathway [6 ]. The structure of lignin is produced by the oxidative polymerization of monolignols, which are p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols such as sinapyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and p-coumaryl alcohol [7 ,8 ]. Those monolignols are obtained from the phenylpropanoid pathway and they are the origin of the basic monomeric units: syringyl (S), guaiacyl (G), and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units [9 ]. Generally, the biosynthesis of lignin involves multiple oxidation processes and enzymes. The composition of monolignol units varies significantly among the different types of plants; for example, the grass contains a mixed type of lignin with all three monolignol units (S, G, and H units) with a low lignin content of 10–19%, whereas in hardwoods a mixed type of lignin with G and S units is in the range between 18 and 25%. In contrast, pine and spruce softwood contains around 25–35% of G-unit. The random arrangement and variations in the basic monomeric units are major contributors to the final constitute of lignin in vascular plants. For example, the presence of H-units in plants has been highly associated with biomass recalcitrance [10 ]. Different linkage has been identified in lignin structure, such as C–C, ester, and alkyl–ether or aryl, among others. Among the multiple bonds, the linkage of β-O-4 outstand for being very strong and the most abundant and common. Those linkages and the presence of functional groups have been reported as responsible for the recalcitrant nature of lignin. Despite the interesting properties that lignin possesses and its great abundance, it is not fully and properly utilized. Lignin has an aromatic nature; thus, it is a valuable feedstock from an industrial perspective. Researchers have demonstrated that it can be used as a raw material for bioplastics, biofuels, resins, biopesticides, fertilizers, and fine chemicals, among others [11–14 ]. It has a great potential to substitute many products derived from fossil-based resources [15 ], decreasing the high dependency on such non-renewable resources. Lignocellulosic biomass is the main source of lignin, being agricultural lands big contributors to dry biomass. Other producers of lignocellulosic waste containing considerable amounts of lignin include sugar, pulp, and paper industries. Annually, 50–70 million tons of lignin are produced only by the pulp and paper manufacturing sector [16 ]. Considering its plentiful and inexpensive nature, lignin valorization has been highly encouraged in recent times. Traditionally, lignin utilization has been restricted as low-quality solid fuels; however, its composition rich in aromatic compounds suggests the production of value-added products and biofuels as new avenues to increase the interest in its valorization. In this manner, the integration of lignin-derived products will lead to sustainable and economical industries based on circular economy concepts. Several barriers can be found in the search for an efficient valorization of lignin, such as high asymmetrical structure, heterogeneity, low reactivity, and structural recalcitrance. Therefore, novel technologies are required to convert lignin into valuable products through scalable, reliable, and cost-effective processes.  Lignin valorization: Opportunities and challenges Extensive quantities of lignocellulosic biomass are continually generated due to uncontrolled urban expansion and the rapid growth of population and consumption. Different studies have evidenced the huge amounts of accessible lignocellulosic residues. The global production of rice straw waste exceeds 730 million metric tons per year, while plant biomass production is approximately 200 × 109  tons per year [17 ]. The generation of lignocellulosic biomass varies depending on the region. For example, most of the rice straw is generated in Asia (667.6 million tons), followed by America (37.2 million tons) [18 ]. Some estimations showed developed countries as the main contributors. The USA produces more than 200 million tons of corn stover residues [19∗∗ ], 150 million metric tons of agricultural waste [20 ], and 26 million metric tons of sugarcane residues [21 ]. Economically developing nations like India and China are also considered important contributors to lignocellulosic biomass; estimations show that 500 million tons of agricultural residues are generated in India, while more than 900 million tons of agricultural straw are generated in China [19∗∗]. Despite the huge existing amounts of lignocellulosic biomass and their industrial potentialities, most of them remain unused. Approximately 600 million tons of different agricultural waste materials are generated by India; however, around 300 million tons of it are discarded without valorization attempts [18 ]. The extensive availability of lignin biomass and its strong aromatic nature placed it as a potential candidate for the sustainable production of value-added chemicals and biofuels. Thus, its proper valorization represents great opportunities for sustainable development by the substitution of non-renewable resources. Improving the efficiency of lignocellulosic valorization processes might contribute significantly to reducing the energy crisis and environmental contamination [22 ]. Lignin valorization incorporated in an integrated biorefinery would be a useful scheme to generate value-added products. Integrated biorefinery is an approach to the sustainable transformation towards an innovative, versatile, and economical industry based on the sustainable exploitation of the abundant lignocellulosic biomass [23 ,24 ]. However, lignin is utilized to a limited extent from an industrial perspective, and its use is even more restricted for advanced materials applications. Typically, lignin valorization through conventional methods is limited to the production of solid fuels with low quality for the generation of heat and electricity in biorefinery industries [25∗∗ ,26 ]. Lignin possesses a structurally stable complex polymer due to its higher insolubility and molecular weight. Therefore, the pretreatment processes of the lignocellulosic biomass are fundamental for the efficient conversion of lignin biomass into high-value products. They increase the vulnerability to enzymatic hydrolysis and cellulose accessibility; pretreatment methods encompass chemical, physical, and biological processes (Figure 2  ). Chemical methods refer to the treatment with acids, alkali, and ionic liquids; physical pretreatments involve sonication, mechanical extrusion, and milling methodologies; while biological pretreatments require a biological agent like fungi to treat the lignocellulose. Regarding the latter, it possesses advantageous features such as the lower energy requirement and its natural identity. In contrast, physical, and chemical treatments typically require chemical reagents and energy inputs and the use of expensive instrumentation. However, some authors have recommended the use of a combination of methods to increase efficiency [27 ]. The recalcitrance nature of lignin remains a potential barrier to cost-effective lignin utilization. Numerous attempts have been focused on the development of innovative bioprocesses to produce tailored lignin for the synthesis of valuable bioproducts [13 ,28 ,29 ]. In this manner, the research community has widely contributed to enhancing the digestibility recalcitrance nature of lignin [29–32 ]. Firstly, providing insights into the properties and the structure of lignin to understand the catalytic deconstruction pathways for its proper valorization. Understanding the intermediate enzymes involved in the pathways and their functions would allow lignin with better characteristics for its valorization. The consideration of lignin composition and the ratio on monomer units is of high relevance to understanding biomass recalcitrance. For example, poplar plants have exhibited a positive correlation between the ratio of G and S units and the bioconversion rates [33 ]. Lignin modification has obtained extensive research attention as well. For instance, the modification of the monomeric composition in lignin or the decrease in the lignin content in lignocellulosic biomass can result in the enhancement of lignin digestibility. Strategies based on the modification of the monomeric ratio result in decreasing the polymerization, hydrophobicity, and interlinkage; thus, enhancing degradability and the overall efficiency of lignin valorization [34 ]. The composition, quantity, and structure of lignin can be improved by altering the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways. Some research groups have explored the alteration of the biosynthesis genes in order to produce designer lignin [35 ]. Experimentation using different plants has demonstrated the key role that bioengineering can play in the improvement of biomass valorization without negative effects on the yield [36 ]. Thus, altering the lignin composition of monomers is considered a potential approach for biomass processing.  Industrial potential of lignin-derived products Lignin utilization is far from being a new concept; in early history, different biomass wastes such as straws and wood were used for the fabrication of tools and fuels. This trend was dramatically shifted to fossil fuels, which have dominated the energy and economical system for many years. In recent times, a new trend has emerged based on the complete utilization of waste materials to replace fossil fuels and non-environmentally friendly sources for material manufacturing and energy purposes. In this context, the abundance and characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass placed it as a suitable and economical candidate. The need to take advantage of these low-cost raw materials has been highlighted, since of the total amount of available biomass, 50% corresponds to lignocellulosic residues. Thus, the research community has explored innovative technologies to convert lignin into useful and high-value products such as biofuels, solvents, food additives, surfactants, pharmacological products, and biomaterials. Energy Global energy demand is growing fast in line with population growth and rising living standards anticipating a possible energy crisis in the future [37 ]. To fulfill the increasing energy demand, fossil fuels like coal, petroleum, and natural gases are highly used. Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources with negative environmental impacts; thus, they are limited in supply and cannot be used sustainably. Furthermore, the burning of fossil fuels is highly associated with global warming by the generation of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide [38 ]. All these reasons have motivated the search for more sustainable alternative sources in order to replace fossil fuels with renewable feedstocks [39 ]. The abundant lignocellulosic biomass produced every year places it as a suitable solution to substitute conventional energy sources. In addition to their abundant supply, their potential has not been fully exploited and they do not compete with food. This is of relevance considering the current malnutrition issues and food scarcity; for example, the production of some biomass-derived products depends on sugar and starch harvest suggesting competition with food production [40 ]. In this manner, the high dependency on fossil fuels can be reduced through an affordable and environmentally friendly approach [41∗ ]. To achieve energy security through the utilization of lignocellulosic feedstock, different processes are required including the conversion of the lignocellulosic structure to fermentable sugars through hydrolysis, which is considered the most challenging stage in biofuel production. Among the many strategies to generate such fermentable sugars, the chemical and enzymatic methods outstand due to their effectiveness. The biomass transformation into biofuels is not a straightforward process; after the hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic structure, other processes such as fermentation and distillation processes must be performed. In this manner, the whole process can be divided into four main stages: (1) partial depolymerization of biomass, (2) enzymatic hydrolysis of pre-treated biomass into simple sugars, (3) fermentation of biomass to fuel, and (4) distillation of the fermented broth to remove impurities [42 ]. Hydrolytic enzymes are required during the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into simple sugars for a facile fermentation. In this respect, Actinobacteria has attracted research attention for its degradable capacities and its ability to produce a broad range of valuable enzymes utilized in biomass transformation [43 ,44 ]. Fermentation can then take place, which is a typical biological process where lignocellulosic biomass is biologically transformed into biofuels by the use of microbes. In addition to biofuels –bioethanol and biobutanol–, other materials, chemicals, and combustion gases are generated. Yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae  are the preferable option for this process since yeasts present higher levels of tolerance to ethanol concentrations and inhibitors that can be generated during the process. The fermentation stage shows serious economic challenges; thus, innovations to propose cost-effective alternatives are currently required.  Food industry The valuable physical, mechanical, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties of lignin-derived products have led to applications in agro-food industries. Various related applications can be found in the literature (Table 1  ). For instance, lignin has multiple applications in agricultural industries such as biopesticides, fertilizers, bioremediation agents, and dispersants. In the food industry, lignin can be converted into polymers with additional properties used for packaging or even used as a functional ingredient in food products [45 ]. The notable antioxidant activity of lignin has been reported by many authors; it has been associated with the polyphenolic structure and has an important role in its applicability for packaging and food [46 ]. Interestingly, the antioxidant activity is strongly influenced by the extraction method used since different lignin structures can be obtained. In this respect, the presence of lignin fractions with low molecular weight and S-units are highly associated with antioxidant activity [47 ,48 ]. Cassoni et al. [45 ] have successfully summarized the evidence that demonstrates the effect of the extraction methods and lignin source on the antioxidant activity. On the other hand, some studies have reported the antimicrobial properties of lignin, specifically against common contaminants in food. For instance, lignin from corn stover has shown antimicrobial activity against multiple bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus , Salmonella enterica , Escherichia coli , and Bacillus subtilis  [45 ,49 ]. Overall, Gram-positive bacteria have shown higher sensitivity to lignin in comparison to Gram-negative bacteria, regardless of the lignin source and the extraction method used [45 ]. Fungi like Aspergillus niger , S. cerevisiae , and Alternaria alternata  has been tested, demonstrating a growth inhibition by lignin [50 ,51 ]. The proposals to apply lignin in food matrices are mainly based on its antioxidant properties. Different authors have suggested the application of lignin-derived products in food to obtain additional benefits. For example, lignin extracted from wheat straw has shown a preventive effect on flavor change, in addition to the antioxidant effect [52 ]. Moreover, nanocomposites for food coating able to prevent microbial spoilage have been developed using lignin from corn stalks [53 ]. In addition to the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, the addition of lignin in biopolymers results in many positive effects in their physical and mechanical properties, including thermal stability, UV resistance, hydrophobicity, tensile strength, and biodegradability [45 ]. Biopolymers have many applications including the manufacturing of active food packaging. The economic importance of such biopolymers relies on improving shelf life by providing upgraded packaging to ensure product quality. In this respect, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of lignin can be highly useful to inhibit or remove harmful species. On the other hand, the antimicrobial properties of lignin support its application as a biopesticide. In this respect, lignin bio-oil showed a better insecticide function in comparison to bio-oil derived from cellulose and hemicellulose [54 ]. Similarly, researchers have reported the development of biodegradable lignin-rich fertilizers using different lignin sources such as wheat straw and sugarcane bagasse [55 ,56 ]. In comparison to the food industry, a small number of studies have reported the employment of lignin as fertilizer or biopesticide for agriculture [11 ,14 ]. Considering the documented antimicrobial activity of lignin, further research efforts should be made in the development of novel agricultural products based on the circular economy.   Conclusions Historically, many applications have been employed and proposed for the abundant source of lignin biomass opening a wide range of possibilities for its valorization. However, several limitations and challenges have slowed down the progress for full exploitation of its industrial potential. In this review, challenges such as the recalcitrant nature and complex methods for its valorization have been discussed, in addition to the research attempts to overcome such barriers. In this respect, innovative bioprocesses and the alteration of biosynthesis genes have been proposed for the production of tailored lignin. Any approach to improving lignin digestibility requires a detailed understanding of the deconstruction pathways, which is why it is also reviewed here. Similarly, the understanding of lignin conversion methodologies including pretreatment processes is fundamental to achieving the successful incorporation of lignin-derived products into the market. Finally, the potential of lignin-derived products in the energy and food sectors was described considering their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The effective valorization of lignin into useful products might represent significant advancements in the SDGs and circular economy aspects.
