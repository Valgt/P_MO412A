                  Using a sample of Chinese listed companies between 2000 and 2020, this study uses the econometric method to examines the influence of financial restrictions on development of green economic growth and sustainable development goals. We also examine how natural resources development rules help businesses overcome financial barriers to green finance and promotes sustainable development goals. Economic recovery is proven less capable when businesses face more financial restraints, and privately held businesses are often more at risk than state-owned ones in this respect. Particularly after 2016, the financing efficiency of businesses in the center and western areas dramatically increases, demonstrating the synergistic effects of green finance regulations and economic policies that promote undeveloped regions. The combination of green financial investment, insurance, and credit shows the greatest positive supportive impact. Insurance serves a bridging function in this combination by better ensuring that clean energy performance matches clean energy projected performance and encouraging clean energy to get green credit financing. The findings also suggest that the existing green financing sector is still following a pattern dictated by the government. The effectiveness of finance is influenced by both elements at the corporate and national levels, such as formal institutions and financial oversight. These results have significant ramifications for policymakers who are considering clean energy policies to assist renewable energy development via a successful financial sector structure, which ultimately aids in realizing the energy sector transformation.

Using a sample of Chinese listed companies between 2000 and 2020, this study uses the econometric method to examines the influence of financial restrictions on development of green economic growth and sustainable development goals. We also examine how natural resources development rules help businesses overcome financial barriers to green finance and promotes sustainable development goals. Economic recovery is proven less capable when businesses face more financial restraints, and privately held businesses are often more at risk than state-owned ones in this respect. Particularly after 2016, the financing efficiency of businesses in the center and western areas dramatically increases, demonstrating the synergistic effects of green finance regulations and economic policies that promote undeveloped regions. The combination of green financial investment, insurance, and credit shows the greatest positive supportive impact. Insurance serves a bridging function in this combination by better ensuring that clean energy performance matches clean energy projected performance and encouraging clean energy to get green credit financing. The findings also suggest that the existing green financing sector is still following a pattern dictated by the government. The effectiveness of finance is influenced by both elements at the corporate and national levels, such as formal institutions and financial oversight. These results have significant ramifications for policymakers who are considering clean energy policies to assist renewable energy development via a successful financial sector structure, which ultimately aids in realizing the energy sector transformation.

Greater resource use and the resulting emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary causes of ecological deterioration (GHG). Recent figures from the show that CO2 accounted for more than 75percentage points of the total GHG emissions in 2017, with emissions coming from a wide range of economic and financial activities, including the manufacturing and use of carbon-intensive fossil fuels (Rasoulinezhad, 2020 ). Therefore, to reach the goals, countries need to identify the variables that might assist cut CO2 emissions and give a path toward a sustainable atmosphere. It has been called for worldwide action to address the growing environmental pollution problems in developing and rising nations rich in natural resources. Countries have pledged to meet ecological sustainability targets by 2040 in several international venues, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) (Rasoulinezhad and Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2022 ). Energy consumers all across the globe were actively involved in the global energy industry, leading to new choices in energy management a nd consumption. In order to solve the trilemma problem, decarbonization has a significant effect on the demand and supply dynamics due to the increased use of recycled energy resources (Taghizadeh-Hesary, et al., 2022a,b , Li et al., 2022 ). Energy security, universal access to inexpensive, clean energy, and environmental sustainability are the three interconnected challenges at the heart of the energy trilemma. As the energy transition improves in all three dimensions, so does the pace at which the trilemma can be solved. There is profound changes in how the world's energy is produced and used due to the energy transition. To maintain its relevance, the Energy Trilemma Index (ETI) is always trying to update its methodology and include new variables that more accurately reflect the dynamic nature of the energy market (Phung et al., 2022 ) (Taghizadeh-Hesary, et al., 2022b ). Ecological rules have been shown to increase “green production” by sure researchers. For example, observed that the rise in operating expenses of commercial pollution treatment facilities in China did not boost its total green factor productivity. There is a correlation between environmental restrictions and green production in OECD nations, as discovered by (Saboori et al., 2022 )(Han et al., 2022 ). More stringent ecological laws have been linked to an overall rising trend in green production, as demonstrated by. Ecological restrictions have a favorable effect on green production, as also discovered. Some research, however, has reached the opposite conclusion. For instance, discovered that China's production firm's green efficiency is negatively affected by ecological rules. The effect of ecological restrictions is non-linear, according to some research. Identified a U-shaped association between China's market-incentive ecological rules and green production from 2006 to 2015. In contrast, discovered an inverted U-shaped relationship (Si et al., 2021 ). Environmental restrictions may positively affect green production, but this may only be the case in countries with a relatively high degree of financial growth. Firstly, ecological restrictions might encourage businesses to create less polluting goods, but less developed regions may need more resources to invest in research and development in this field (Jin et al., 2022 ). Secondly, the extent to which an invention is implemented influences whether or not its benefits can compensate for the costs of ecological restrictions(Zheng et al., 2022a ). Green technology tends to be more expensive, and economies with a smaller gross domestic product (GDP) do not have the scale to offset that. Third, if less developed regions have adequate green innovation stock, it is possible to deploy these technologies owing to the absence of complementarity support from other technologies. For good measure, suggested the environmental Kuznets curve. An inverted U-shaped association between financial development and pollution was discovered. As economies develop, ecological quality worsens before gradually improving due to increased production. The ecological Kuznets curve would be compatible with the hypothesis that ecological control is only effective in regions with high GDP (Zheng et al., 2022b ). China is the relevant research sample as China is the most fantastic user of natural resources. Moreover, the nation has the fastest-growing economy in the world, as shown by its advanced banking sector. China is a resource-rich nation because of its plentiful coal, oil, and natural gas. China also produces a plethora of other crucial minerals and is a leading producer of fossil fuels. For example, in recent years, China has worked to secure a reliable supply of minerals needed in the electronic elements of many industries, including defense, communications, and the development and storage of renewable energy. China is home to considerable quantities of other vital minerals like vanadium, graphite. China also possesses enormous deposits of rare earth elements used in high-tech materials (Liu et al., 2022b ). To analyze the difficulties as mentioned above, a sample of listed Chinese companies is employed in this research. The CNIPA data on green patenting, which includes both patent numbers and patent claims, is used as a proxy for companies' capacity for green inventions. A green ratio, which compares the number of green patents to all patents, is also calculated to show how heavily businesses emphasize green ideas. A synthetic index based on multiple finance factors constructed measures financial restrictions. Our key result is that green finance policies may considerably improve green innovation capacities by addressing the consequences of funding challenges encountered by businesses. Under the existing green financing laws, POEs are undoubtedly less creditworthy than SOEs, which limits their capacity for green innovation. This paper's contribution may be summed up as follows. First, our findings support financial limitations' markedly detrimental effect on Chinese businesses' green innovation. Second, by analyzing the implications of the green finance policy via the enterprises' financing restrictions, we provide a novel perspective on green innovation in the existing literature. Investigating the disparity in distribution between POEs and SOEs leads to several conclusions. Thirdly, this work sets itself apart from previous research by measuring research outputs using a variety of metrics. This allows for a thorough assessment of green innovation skills.  2 Literature review 2.1 Nexus among economic growth and green economic development To paraphrase “The Organization for Financial Cooperation and Growth,” “Green growth” promotes financial development and expansion while protecting natural wealth to keep giving back to the community and the environment. It involves developing a sustainable financial system that uses minimal amounts of carbon. It is a potential method of financial growth that would not compromise on issues like climate change or ecological sustainability. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum of a country's output of goods and services during a specific period multiplied by the inflation rate. As industrialization and globalization spread throughout the world, so do the risks of rapid depletion of natural resource assets. Letting it continue unchecked leads to even more pollution, climate changes, biodiversity loss, and depletion of natural resources. The entire economy needs Green Development. The adoption of green growth policies aids economic development (Liu et al., 2022a ). Possessing a wealth of natural resources is beneficial to a country's economy. A healthy economy is essential, and natural resources are celebrated for fostering progress and prosperity. We looked at the impact of fluctuating raw material prices on growth in the BRICS economies from 1890 to 2020. More uncertainty in the factors under study is beneficial to economic performance (Lin, 2022 ).The causal analysis also revealed a reciprocal relationship among the factors. The article also claimed that helping spread green technology would help the planet. It found that this natural resource plays a significant role in determining the success of the BRICS economies. Different results are obtained from the endowment of natural resources and economic growth, and these two elements are cointegrated with the other components included in the research (1990–2020). They conclude that natural gas prices are causally related to economic growth (Qiao et al., 2022 ). From 1970 to 2019, we looked at data from various sources to see how natural resources have fared in helping Sub-Saharan African countries' economies grow. China's financial development from 1995 to 2017 was examined, along with the effects of natural resource volatility and green financing (Li et al., 2022b ). Discovered a highly significant positive relationship between the presence of natural resources and economic growth. Find that the link between China's natural resources and GDP works both ways. Determine the environmental footprint's relation to the profits from natural resources. According to the findings, there were significant relationships among the factors studied (W. Liu et al., 2008 ).A better functioning economy is another benefit of promoting green growth. The significance of natural resources, human capital, and organizational quality to economic growth was investigated in a seminal study. According to the findings, increasing human resources and institutional funding would help the country develop faster. Green financing and the unpredictability of natural resources are suitable for the economy. An article published in 2020 by Wang et al.,(2022)  argues that improved economic performance can be achieved with the help of natural resources, but only if those resources are managed well by robust organizations. However, natural resources sometimes benefit a country's long-term economic health. The decline of China's economy is linked to the country's reliance on its natural resources. Natural resource depletion has been shown to stunt Russia's economic development. Although oil rents tend to go up as economies grow, natural gas rents tend to go down (Ikram et al., 2019 ) (Abbas et al., 2022 ). Contrary to common belief, however, studies (Sun et al., 2019b ) (Iram et al., 2020 ) have shown that economic growth and natural resource uncertainty are positively correlated. There is a negative significance and connection between natural resource volatility and global financial effectiveness, even as natural gas rents and administration boost global financial efficiency. They also demonstrated the link between public management quality and the uncertainty of natural resources, which could explain the recent increase in global financial efficiency. They concluded that the wild swings in resource prices stunted economic development. It also demonstrated that Covid-19 substantially contributed to the economic downturn, whereas green financing contributed to the recovery and growth of the economy. This resulted in the discovery of the resource curse effect, which is responsible for the poor economic growth experienced by regions abundant in natural resources. It was also determined how much of a toll both direct and indirect influences on economic growth have on the quality of a business (Sun et al., 2019a ).  2.2 Green growth and economic performance Sustainable development is an objective that requires different strategies in each country. Sustainable economic growth is made possible by “green development,” or the adoption of growth technologies that minimize negative impacts on the ecosystem improved economic performance by studying innovative green growth (process and manufacturing). Claim that the goal of fiscal policy should be to encourage ecologically friendly development that is also resource efficient. Found that environmental progress is only correlated with increased greenhouse gas emissions in one direction. The findings also underlined the need to scale down financial growth to achieve green development and neutrality targets(Mohsin et al., 2018 ). Only some studies(Iqbal et al., 2022 ) have evaluated the effect of ecological technology on the financial and ecological efficiency of Chinese enterprises and Korean-owned firms in the state of China or determined whether or not there is a correlation between environmental innovation and financial output. Environmental innovation aids in sustainable development by increasing both economic and environmental productivity. Investigated how ecological growth can be made more cost-effective without sacrificing efficiency. The results positively impacted the asset value and equity of the companies studied. There is a substantial indirect influence of eco-innovation on the financial achievement of businesses, as evidenced by the reduction of emissions necessary for economic development due to technological progress in the environmental sphere (Mohsin et al., 2020b ). Nonetheless, the (Xia et al., 2020 ) findings show that emerging economies lag behind the developed world regarding green growth. Tourism and environmentally friendly technology were analyzed for their divergent impacts on GDP growth in the world's top 10 nations. The positive effects of green technology on GDP growth and carbon emissions were demonstrated in this study, providing support for the tourism-led development theory in the countries analyzed. Discovered a link between originality of mind and environmental health. Analyzed how green innovation is used and how green innovation affects green development. The empirical data showed a positive correlation between green technology and green trade on green development over the longer term. In general, it has been found that green technological innovation contributes to green growth. It has also been found that increased spending on green finance and innovative technologies increase GDP, which benefits the environment (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Renewable energy's contribution to a thriving economy cannot be stressed enough. Using renewable energy to reduce harmful carbon emissions is essential to long-term financial and ecological sustainability (Mohsin et al., 2020a ).examining the correlation between renewable energy and economic growth are many. They observed bidirectional causality between economic growth and the use of renewable energy sources for the sample or sample member countries. They concluded that there is a causal relationship between adopting renewable energy and economic growth in OECD countries. The effect is positive, but the influence is negative until emerging economies reach a certain threshold. The effects on developing and developed countries were studied, and while they were found to be positive in the case of OECD countries, no effect was found in developed economies. The results show that switching to renewable energy sources slows economic growth, though the effect varies with socioeconomic status.   3 Methods 3.1 Theortical background Using investment in non-assets and energy use as indicators, this study looks at the effects of the global energy trilemma and transformative energy development on financial development and ecological sustainability of the SDGs from 2000 to 2020. mediator factors. We started by making our case from the vantage point of an energy-transformation-technology-and-capital-goods-based, two-sector manufacturing model. Knowledge-containing intermediate financial products in the energy industry owe their existence to extensive research and development (R&D), which in turn is responsible for the industry's technological advancements (Wu et al., 2022 ). Since there are several sources of power, the manufacturing parameter capital (Ki) will consist of a range of capital items (Xiuzhen et al., 2022 ) that may be combined with any of the inputs.(1) K i  = ∫ O N  K i j   d j        (2) Y i  = A L  i 1 − a   ∑ j = 1  N  X i j  a        3.1.1 Entropy method All four GFIs and their permutations of them are examined in this research. To synthesize GFI-related data, the volatility approach is used. It is information theory that gives rise to the idea of entropy. System disarray may be quantified using this tool. The degree of variance in the Data is considered while determining the fair values for time series using the information gain approach (Umair and Dilanchiev, 2022 )As a result, it is more suited for weight estimates than those subjective approaches (Grossman and Krueger, 1995 )Four GFI sequences are combined into a single indicator (dubbed IGFIs) based on each GFI time series's estimated values to depict the overall growth level of green finance (Ullah et al., 2020 )(3) I G F I s   = ∑ j  w j  × G F I j    , j = 1,2,3 ,      For each GFIj,  there is a j th, which indicates the GFI's specific weight (Yoshino et al., 2021 ). Before we can do anything further, let's consider the data acquired from the four different GFIs by transforming their indices into a matrix G=(GFIij )m × n. Classic normalized change G=(GFIij)m × n to B=(bij)m × n, a new matrix with the exact dimensions as the original matrix G (Sironen and Mononen, 2018 ).As demonstrated in Equation B=(bij )m × n, the probability of bij (denoted as pij) is calculated, as illustrated (4).(4) p i j   = b i j   ∑ i  b i j     p i j   = b i j   ∑ i  b i j          Based on P=(PIJ)mn, the entropy value (hj) is calculated, as indicated in Eq. (4) , using the matrix P=(PIJ)mn (5).(5) h j  = − ( ln  4  )  − 1   ∑ i  p i j    ln  p i j         where pij  = 0, set pijlnpij = 0, then 0 ≤ hj ≤ 1. Finally, the weight coefficient wj can be determined, a(6) w j  = 1 − h j   ∑ j  ( 1 − h j   )           3.2 Time-series econometrics Analyzing financial relationships between green financing and GB expansion using time series quantitative methods is a promising technique (Huang et al., 2022 ). More specifically, this research uses VAR and VEC models since they can not only evaluate the dynamic link between GFIs and GBs but also deal with the temporal lag in this interplay. The following is a typical time series macroeconomic analysis procedure. First, a unit root test is carried out to see whether the Data is suitable for forecasting models. Next, stationary and stochastic time series are analyzed using VAR and VEC models. Analysis of original signal and variance breakdown of GFIs' contributions to forming GBs are carried out using the predicted models. These procedures are detailed in the following sections. 3.2.1 Unit root test It is necessary to use suitable macroeconomic models based on the data features provided by the unit root test results to investigate the influence of GFIs on GBs. The goal of unit root testing is to determine whether or not a time series is stationary. If a data set's mean, variability, and correlation are all unchanged for any given time lag and exhibit no patterns in function, it is considered stationary. Data that cannot be modeled or projected because the outcomes may have a misleading association are known as nonstationary datasets (Colditz et al., 1986 ). As a result, time series that are neither stationary nor nonlinear should be handled differently. Three standard unit root tests are the Dickey-Fuller, enhanced Dickey-Fuller, and Phillips-Perron.   3.3 Johansen cointegration test Cointegration tests are carried out if there are stochastic series with the same order, as determined by the results of unit root testing. Cointegration occurs when two or more nonstationary time series are linearly combined to produce a stationary time series. First, cointegration tests must be carried out. A differentiating criterion is used to find the appropriate lag order. The cointegration test is run next to find out how many cointegrations there are. Regarding cointegration testing, the two most popular approaches are EG two-step and the Johansen maximum probability When it comes to cointegration testing, the former is a simple one-equation test, but the latter also takes into account the number of cointegration vectors (Wijndaele et al., 2011 ) This research uses the Johansen maximum probability technique.  3.4 VAR model (Hozawa et al., 2007 ) popularized VAR models as a multivariate time series expansion of the single variance decomposition model. It's used to explain the dynamic connection between fixed effects. The elasticity and accessibility of VAR models for multivariate periods have made them popular in microeconomics as a complement to large-scale synchronous equation structural models (Go et al., 2013 ) The dynamic entangled link between the green financing industry and the GB property market may be examined using VAR analysis. According to Eq., the bivariate VAR model (y1t and y2t) is used in the majority of the VAR models in this research (7).(7) { y 1 t   = β 10  + ∑ i = 1  k  β 1 i   y 1 , t − i     + ∑ i = 1  k  α 1 i   y 2 , t − i     + u 1 t      y 2 t   = β 20  + ∑ i = 1  k  β 2 i   y 1 , t − i     + ∑ i = 1  k  α 2 i   y 2 , t − i     + u 2 t           (8) { d y 1 t   = β 10  + ∑ i = 1  M  β 1 i   d y 1 , t − i   + ∑ i = 1  M  α 1 i   d y 2 , t − i   + θ 1  V E C M t − 1   + ε 1 t          d y 2 t   = β 20  + ∑ i = 1  M  β 2 i   d y 1 , t − i   + ∑ i = 1  M  α 2 i   d y 2 , t − i   + θ 2  V E C M t − 1   + ε 2 t                 3.5 Data sources The panel dataset of Chinese publicly traded firms operating from 2000 to 2020 is the foundation for the empirical analysis in this paper. Financial information, including financial statements, comprehensive income, and cash flow, as observed in the China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) Database, are the sources for the indicators used to create an index of financing constraints is presented in Table 1  .   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Main results Standard deviation values indicate that the top ten and the near-bottom ten selected countries of the SDGs index 2021 may anticipate a wide range of behavior from transformative energy development. We calculate using the Kolmogorov entropy distribution. The factor correlation shows that the global energy trilemma has positive associations with financial growth and negative associations with environmental damage. Similarly, there is a negative correlation between transformative energy technologies and economic progress and a positive correlation between the ecological footprint in the top ten countries in the Sustainable development goals (SDG index 2021). It is inversely related to financial development and ecological effect; however, in the near bottom ten selected nations with Sustainable development goals (SDG indicator 2020). The model results indicate that innovative energy sources, non-financial asset investment, and energy usage contribute to global financial development and variable statistics is presented in Table 2  . In model II, the global energy trilemma and disruptive technologies harm the ecosystem. On the other hand, the China country in the Sustainable development goals (SDG index 2021 have a larger ecological footprint due to higher energy consumption and spending on non-financial assets. Overall, these findings show that the top ten countries on the Sustainable development goals (SDG index 2021 are actively working toward a world free of the energy trilemma by, among other things, developing transformative energy innovations, increasing financial development, and safeguarding ecological sustainability in Table 3  . On the other hand, spending money on infrastructure and energy consumption boosts financial growth but comes at the expense of environmental stability. Increases in material and energy consumption associated with economic expansion contribute to a non-sustainable state of affairs. In contrast, the findings of this paper about the global energy trilemma suggested that overcoming the trilemma's three challenges at once might promote long-term economic growth and ecological sustainability. These challenges are accessibility and affordability; security; and sustainability in Table 4  . This finding indicates that the global energy trilemma allows countries to monitor their progress and get insight into what is and is not working. In addition, these rulings provide no silver bullet for the world's energy trilemma problems; instead, long-term solutions can be achieved only via cooperation between the private industry, consumers, states, and industry can be attributed to the findings that a one percent increase in such growth reduces the environmental footprint of the top ten provincial of China, respectively. Increased environmental sustainability is offset by slower economic growth using renewable energy sources. This research proves that new energy innovations are required to reduce energy consumption while maintaining current levels of energy efficiency. Expanding and enhancing architecture to deliver more efficient and clean energy may stimulate growth and improve the environment, as shown by these outcomes. In addition, these findings bolster the argument that renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and thermal energy must be prioritized if the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 is to be achieved by 2040. Table 5   lists the estimated dynamic VAR findings. The displayed result indicates that NIS has a positive and a negative statistical significance when used to explain NS. This finding illustrates how rising resource pollution is accelerating ecological deterioration and how green expenditure in the economy provides a crucial chance to lessen this impact. This finding parallels research done by. Moreover, compared to traditional sectors that do not use green innovation, the economic and environmental effectiveness of businesses that have made green investments is far higher. Equally, ES negative significance in explaining NIS holds. The findings revealed that rents are brought about by altering ES owing to the use of natural resources. The leading producers of these material items—manufacturing, industrialization, and urbanization—are the main depleters of natural resources. The ecological footprint is negatively elastic concerning the abundance of natural resources; more abundant natural resources result in a larger ecological footprint. Since the coefficient of natural resource availability is negative, countries with little natural resources must rely on imported fossil fuel energy to build an economy that does not affect the ecosystem. These results show that China is not optimizing its use of its natural resources and is using inefficient energy strategies that will not cause it to become less dependent on conventional energy sources. The abundance of raw materials in China might be responsible for the country's environmental impact. To accomplish environmental objectives without endangering the country's wealth, China aims to establish ecological footprint requirements for significant sectors of the economy. When the rent on available resources rises, so makes the associated ecological footprint, as argued in a similar vein. Furthermore, ES is both positively and negatively relevant in helping to explain Age. This finding sheds light on how a deficiency in ES may adversely affect the environment and the climate, whereas gains in ES can mitigate warming and boost Age. A considerable drop in pollution is possible if green technology is used correctly. Therefore, the Chinese state uses environmentally friendly technologies to shield itself from the dangerous impacts of the natural world. Finally, both the positive and negative importance of GDP are found in explaining Age. These results validate the EKC theory in China, suggesting that when financial development occurs, pollution levels increase in terms of the ecological footprint. However, once financial development reaches its optimal level, pollution levels decrease. The current study investigates the impact of China's “ecological footprint” on the environment by analyzing the asymmetric link between green expenditure, natural resource rent, green technological development, and financial growth. Table 6   displays the results of the predicted variables' long-term asymmetric link. It has been shown that ES and Age have a long-term asymmetric link that can go either way. Multiple studies' findings of a correlation between ES and Age have been statistically confirmed. Therefore, it is recommended that the state raises people's consciousness about the need to practice environmentally friendly practices in the workplace and at home. R&D also shows a negative asymmetric long-term connection with Age. This indicates that an increase in ES will negatively affect Age, ultimately leading to a more severe deterioration of R&D. It was also said that growing economies lead to more demands for R&D, which significantly negatively affects the natural world. As it turns out, R&D boosts Age in China. The beneficial impact of R&D on the Age, as reported by(Bohr and McCreery, 2020 ), suggests that R&D needs to be extracted and utilized efficiently and sustainably in Table 7  .While evidence suggests a favorable and unfavorable long-term relationship between SME and Age, this link is not balanced. This is explored in light of technical improvements to convert the original industry into an eco-friendly one that conserves resources and creates little or no environmental pollution. Consequently, it is suggested that the state promote public education about adopting sustainable practices in everyday life and using green innovation that permits effectiveness with minimum ecological effect in industrial and household activities. At last, it is shown that Age and R&D have a long-term connection that is neither uniformly positive nor negative. According to, financial growth initially raises the Age, yet, it subsequently improves the quality of the climate. Consistent with earlier claims, we now know that a growing economy boosts the Age. found that the ecological footprint had grown due to the absence of stringent regulations stressing environmental concerns at a time of fast development. This calls for an assessment of current practices and principles and limits imposed by the proper authorities to ensure future environmental health. Several analyses were performed before settling on. Also, residual normalcy was found by the Jarque-Bera test with a value of 5.671, showing no multicollinearity in the research model. Its statistical significance naturally reflects that our model has been appropriately presented that the model is also stable in this investigation. All of the model's variables are so stable, as can be shown in Table 8  . Scholars and policymakers have recently paid a great deal of attention to the question of what variables influence the volatility of natural resources. In this context, the research looks at how things like GDP growth, international commerce, energy investments, and technological progress play a role. According to the data, the volatility of natural resources in 30 different regions throughout China is greatly exacerbated by economic growth, international commerce, and technological advancement. Notably, financial activities that stimulate expenditure in creating additional products and services are closely correlated with improvements in financial effectiveness(G. Li et al., 2020 ). The increased activities stimulate financial development and increase the use of fossil fuels, which causes a rise and fall in the price of these fuels. However, the countries and businesses that rely on oil exports provide additional energy resources to maximize their profits. The increased availability of natural resources increases the resource's inherent instability. These correlations are consistent with the findings of, which found a positive link between financial growth and natural resource volatility. As a result of rising worldwide demand, exporting economies are compelled to ramp up output to meet international demand and generate income. Technological advancements can produce more products and services with less labor. As a result, these positive shifts in natural resource availability are driving up demand. Empirical research by supports statements by the latter author that increased trade openness leads to price swings in natural resources(Zakari et al., 2022 ). Development in technical innovation and green technology dramatically disrupts natural resource demand and supply chain, leading to natural resource instability. Further, the data show that spending money on energy resources has an unfavorable impact on the volatility of such resources. The empirical findings of this study are in line with those of existing research by, which claim that investing in energy resources, such as renewable energy resources, significantly reduces natural resource volatility because of its capacity to lower natural resource usage(Offodile et al., 2010 ). Given the paucity of data in the current research, this research kicks off a new policy-level discussion on the variables influencing natural resource volatility in Chinese provinces. Using these empirical findings, the paper proposes several policy solutions to address natural resource volatility among Chinese regions.   5 Conclusion and policy implications The literature on the resource curse phenomenon is enormous. Using a sample of Chinese listed companies between 2000 and 2020, this study uses the econometric method to examines the influence of financial restrictions on development of green economic growth and sustainable development goals. Despite their riches of natural resources, resource-rich countries nonetheless face several challenges to their financial and monetary development. The VAR method is ideal to undertake a comprehensive investigation that provides actionable insights into critical policy issues. The results of these tests reveal that there is only one order of integration, across all the variables. Using the VAR method the interrelationship between variables based on their quantiles. The existence of the resource curse hypothesis in China is substantiated by the negative and statistically significant impact of NIS on ES. Since the Chinese government needs more time to figure out its financial plan, the country's financial development has slowed down generally. Similar to how ES was boosted by fiscal decentralization and financial innovation, the effect of China's resource curse was mitigated. The error correction model parameter was also strongly negative, suggesting a recovery of China's long-term relationship between the dependent and independent variables. VAR postulates a connection between; the Wald and Granger Causality tests confirm this hypothesis regarding the stated association's strength and direction. This study confirmed The Chinese version of the “resource curse” theory. The findingsthat China is a resource-rich country with great potential to reverse the resource curse by taking new indicators to put natural resources rent better use in boosting residential demand to some policy recommendations. manufacturing. Proper resource administration is essential right now. The government might boost income more quickly by encouraging value-added exports rather than selling essential commodities and minerals. To further strengthen the financial structure at the state level, the administration should encourage self-financing, co-financing, and inter-government money transfer as part of fiscal decentralization. Because technological innovation has been shown to affect ES positively, the state must also improve the current economic system. To this end, substantial resources must be devoted to research and development to foster new economic technology growth. In addition, reliable contract enforcement is essential for preserving trade revenues and monetary security. Like how the state prioritizes policy stability, mechanisms should be implemented to deal with the high NIS issue.
