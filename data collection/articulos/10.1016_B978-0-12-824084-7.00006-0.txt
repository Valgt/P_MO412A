               The chapter outlines the main features of national and international policy-making process in the area of energy and environment. The standard policy-making cycle is adjusted to incorporate the multifacet nature of the subject area, along with involvement of various stakeholders.
               Further, security aspects in key universal international agreements with environmental and energy goals, including the UN Resolution establishing SDGs, are analyzed. Besides setting the harmonized energy and environmental goals, they wipe out the zero-sum game and free rider risks, limit discrimination, and bring more substantial results. Moreover, these agreements provide grounds for discussions, information exchange, and cooperation for all signatories. Regional agreements may also bring security gains, including a more optimal use of resources and production capacities among member states, while at the same time may create tensions with the third parties.
               Additionally, the possibility to harmonize energy and environmental policies from the security perspectives is discussed. How could energy and environmental targets be attained simultaneously? At which level should efforts be applied, and where is the power concentrated? The following approaches are suggested: common administration, interdepartmental cooperation, and integration of energy and environmental priorities in one document.
               The chapter finishes with an outlook of the changing international relations around global environmental and energy security priorities. Despite the growing trends toward regionalism and nation-state protectionism, the future of energy and environment security is associated with universalism. Global accords allow addressing the public goods nature of both energy and environment, grand challenges (climate, pandemic, etc.), and the most efficient and timely responses.

The market failures include the public good nature of energy resources, environmental externalities, high capital costs, deficiencies in marginal cost pricing for electricity, efficiencies in prduction and allocation, and lack and asymmetry of information (Siebert, 2008 ; Gillingham et al., 2009 ; Sovacool, 2011 ). Behavioral failures are associated with barriers and constraints to pro-ecological behavior (Gaspar, 2013 ). Energy policy is closely related with economic policy, foreign policy, and national and international security policy. Traditionally, the goals of energy policy were closely linked with assuring energy security, including “security of supply, affordability, and limited impact on the environment” (Kohl, 2004 ). Thus, environmental considerations have been integrated in energy policy and senergy security, and this interlink has been accentuated in the course of the past decades. In the same period, environmental and climate issues have gained importance and, similar to energy considerations, have  also been included in the economic, international relations, and security domains. Additionally, energy and environmental policy discussions are increasingly intertwined with technological change, as energy and environment policy interventions may create significant effects (constraints or incentives) for technological progress (Kohl, 2004 ; Proskuryakova, 2018 ). Environmental policy, like energy policy, is closely connected with a number of other policy domains, including economic, energy, and industrial policy. The interactions between ecosystems and mankind result in environmental degradation, the increasing economic and social demand for natural resources, ecosystem services, and environmental goods, and represent the major challenges for environment security (Zurlini and Müller, 2008 ). Thus, environmental security involves threats to national and human security posed by environmental change (Barnett, 2020 ). According to the AC/UNU Millennium Project, environmental security incorporates the following components: “adverse impact of human activities on the environment,” “the direct and indirect effects of various forms of environmental change (especially scarcity and degradation), which may be natural or human-generated on national and regional security,” and “insecurity individuals and groups (from small communities to humankind) experience due to environmental change such as water scarcity, air pollution, global warming, and so on” (Zurlini and Müller, 2008 ). The process of national energy and environment policy-making follows the same cycle as most other policy processes (Fig. 22.1  ). The main difficulties arise from the need to integrate priorities that may be diverse or even polar. Another complication is the need to take into account the interests and opinions of a wide range of stakeholder groups, where the position of energy stakeholders (especially large energy companies) may prevail.  Global policy-making is more complicated. International arena is the area where national interests clash, countries try to move forward their priorities by establishing alliances or exercising pressure, seeking compromise or using other (i.e., economic) issues as a leverage. Energy security has traditionally caused multiple diplomatic and military conflicts among nations. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and International Energy Agency (IEA) were consecutively established as a response to the 1970s oil crisis. Global energy and environmental policies are developed not only by policymakers. Other stakeholders also initiate new policies or express positions on existing laws and regulations. Business offers advice and good practice (such as closed-loop technologies) and addresses grand challenges as part of corporate social responsibility and charity programs (such as Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). Companies could also react to security risks by establishing international organizations, as it was the case with the World Energy Council (Russ, 2020 ). At the global level, green growth was put forward at the G20 Los Cabos Summit in Mexico in 2012 (G20 Information Center, 2012 ) and provided the basis for a business alliance of corporations (В20). The B20 Group is made up of business leaders from 19 developed and developing countries and the European Union. Until 2019, the B20 Group has addressed issues of energy and environmental security numerous times. In 2020, B20 and IEA issued a joint call on the G20 to accelerate clean energy transitions for a resilient economic recovery, building on the energy demand and related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions downward trends set by the COVID-19 pandemic. The joint statement calls for accelerated deployment of existing and new low-emissions and emissions-neutral technologies, including hydrogen, energy storage, and carbon capture, storage, and use CCSU. B20 and IEA also underline the need “to secure energy systems and provide access to affordable and uninterrupted flow of clean energy for all” (IEA, 2020 ). Global civil society is also an active player in advancing and monitoring sustainable policy agenda. Environmental civil society organizations (CSOs), like Greenpeace and WWF, point out government or corporate actions that violate environmental law. They are also instrumental in raising public awareness on environmental security issues. In some instances, CSOs may put forward policy initiatives aimed at putting energy-related issues on political agenda and ultimately changing energy systems. Given the close relations between environmental issues, climate change, and energy, the same CSOs are often involved in setting both environmental and energy security policy agenda (Biagini and Sagar, 2004 ; Blanchet, 2015 ). This chapter is structured as follows. Section 2  discusses multilateral agreements that set up environmental and energy goals. Section 3  analyzes options for harmonizing environmental and energy security priorities, including the integration of environment and energy policy-making under one administration, close interdepartmental cooperation, and adoption of single policy documents (international agreements, laws, and regulation, etc.). Section 4  looks into the future of international relations around energy and environment security.  2 The main international agreements with environmental and energy goals The international agreements, negotiations around them, and national strategies provided a significant impetus for advancing renewable and other low-carbon technologies: hydrogen; CCSU; solar and  wind; geothermal, wave, and other, including revolutionary ones. This section features several multilateral agreements with environmental and energy goals, with a focus on those that are universal in nature, i.e., signed by all (or nearly all) countries in the world under the auspices of the United Nations, the world's only organization with universal representation. The documents are arranged by subject area. 2.1 Green growth and sustainable development agreements The Johannesburg Declaration and Plan of Implementation, agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, identify global challenges and specific timetable to address some of them, as well as underline the continuous international oversight on sustainability agreements. Both documents emphasize the human dimension of sustainability and the cross-sectoral security aspects, such as food security and secure housing. With regard to energy security, the focus is on energy efficiency, affordability and accessibility, and the integration of energy issues into socioeconomic programs. The interlink of energy and environmental security is made through improved “access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally sound energy services and resources, taking into account national specificities and circumstances, through various means, such as enhanced rural electrification and decentralized energy systems, increased use of renewables, cleaner liquid and gaseous fuels, and enhanced energy efficiency, by intensifying regional and international cooperation in support of national efforts, including through capacity-building, financial and technological assistance, and innovative financing mechanisms, including at the micro- and meso-levels, recognizing the specific factors for providing access to the poor ” (UN, 2002 ). In 2009, the green economic growth policy was officially adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as strategic medium-term (until 2030) and long-term (until 2050) development paths (OECD, 2011 ). Forty-seven countries, including those that are not members of OECD, adhered to the Declaration. There is no “one-size-fits-all” solution for fostering greener growth that depends on economic development, policy and institutional context, societal issues, environmental pressures, and other factors. Therefore, countries put forward green growth plans and strategies that should take into account national social and economic priorities, and social equity considerations (OECD, 2009 , 2021 ). For example, Vietnam National Green Growth Strategy (Viet Nam National, 2012 ) “must be based on science and modern technologies ” and “ contributes to employment, poverty reduction, and improving the material and spiritual life of all people .” The document is also linked with the national climate change strategy. “The Future We Want,” the outcome document adopted at Rio+20, focuses on green economic growth without negative externalities for the environment (UN, 2012 ). Similarly to the Johannesburg Declaration and Plan of Implementation, the document emphasizes the human dimension of sustainability (including access to sustainable modern energy services for all) and the cross-sectoral security aspects, such as food security. Energy efficiency measures are called for in “urban planning, buildings, and transportation, and in the production of goods and services and the design of products .” Sustainable development is regarded as integration of economic, social, and environmental aspects, and their interlinkages at all levels. The document underlines the use of renewable and other low-emission energy technologies, increasing energy efficiency and more sustainable use of fossil fuels, access to electricity, and sustainable cooking and heating solutions. According to the document, the listed technologies are important for securing development, meeting the climate targets, and promoting research and development in all countries.  One of the key documents is the UN General Assembly Resolution that set the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in September 2015 (UN, 2015 ). The SDGs for 2015–30 became the new agenda and a plan of action “for people, planet, and prosperity.” Energy issues are in the focus of SDG7 “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all,” while a number of other SDGs also tackle sustainable generation, distribution and use of energy and natural resources. Environmental concerns are integrated in SDG 15 “Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss,” SDGs 6 and 12. The global effort to attain SDGs sets the international policy agenda around sustainable development that addresses energy, climate, and environmental challenges together (Proskuryakova and Loginova, 2021 ). Energy and environment security is addressed in SDG7 through the energy access and affordability aspects, in SDG15 by combatting environmental problems caused by climate change and anthropogenic activity, restoration of degraded ecosystems, and addressing threats to human security caused by the loss of biodiversity, resource scarcity, and ecosystem change. There are 12 environment targets related to SDG15 that address a wider array of security issues compared with five energy targets for SDG7. If considered together with eight targets of SDG6 on water and sanitation, it may be noted that there are many more environmental targets that cover a wide array of security aspects. SDG 12 merges environment and energy targets and security elements under the common umbrella of sustainable production and consumption (UN, 2021 ).  2.2 Environment and climate agreements There are several conventions that deal with pollution of air, water, and soil (i.e., Convention On Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution 1979) and a few that limit and control the pollutants—waste generation, disposal, and movement (i.e., Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal 1989). These agreements are aimed at minimizing damage to the environment. The implications for the energy industry most commonly include the shift to clean energy sources, application of pollution prevention and resource efficient technologies, and adoption of circular economy solutions (such as waste-to-energy). Importantly, multilateral agreements underline the transboundary nature of energy and environmental security challenges, and list solutions that need to be applied by all parties. Agreements and conventions that focus on climate change also state energy and environment-related goals. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (1985) is a framework convention that requires countries to take control actions to protect the ozone layer. The Vienna Convention principles were later laid down in the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987). The 1997 Kyoto Protocol operationalized the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC): its signatories commited to limit GHG emissions in line with agreed national targets. In 2015 the Kyoto Protocol was replaced by the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty that aims to prevent and mitigate global warming. It has multiple implications for environment and energy security, including advancement of renewable and low-carbon energy technologies, the sustainable use of fossil fuels and large hydropower plants, as well as increased energy efficiency. As stated by Yvo de Boer, UNFCC Executive Secretary, at the Major economies meeting on climate change and energy security in September 2007: “Overall, mitigation action needs to ensure that the aggregate result of mitigation initiatives is commensurate with the challenge of maintaining climate security ” (UN Climate Change, 2007 ).  The UN Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa (1994) specifies the following actions that have to be included in national action plans “sustainable management of natural resources, especially the rational management of drainage basins ,” “sustainable management of natural resources in high-altitude areas ,” “rational management and conservation of soil resources and exploitation and efficient use of water resources .” Additionally, convention signatories need to develop and apply emergency plans to address risks related to desertification, such as droughts, by using specially designed instruments like early warning systems, and efficient use of available energy sources, including nontraditional ones. The agreement also underlines the need to enhance the availability of scarce natural resources in affected areas, such as water, through the application of new technologies, including cloud seeding. Information about best available technologies, including the new ones could be made accessible through specific information systems and centers along with terms and conditions of their acquirement. Summarizing the main features of multilateral environmental agreements, it may be noted that agreements with the largest number of signatories are environmental conventions, since they tackle issues of global public good. Issues like climate change and transboundary pollution cannot be addressed by few countries and require a global approach (Besedeš et al., 2020 ). Agreements that regulate the use of resources (i.e., fisheries) are commonly concluded with neighboring countries, trade partners, or counties that share common interest. The topics covered by international environmental agreements are very diverse: about one-third of them is related to species, one-third to pollution and energy, and the remaining third are devoted to wide range of other issues (Mitchell et al., 2020 ).  2.3 Energy agreements One of the key international energy documents is the International Energy Charter Treaty of 1994 that provides a multilateral framework for cross-border energy cooperation (Energy Charter, 1994 ). The Treaty aims at promoting energy security by establishing more open and competitive energy markets, with due consideration of sustainable development principles and energy resources sovereignty. Energy security is enhanced through “the protection of foreign investments…, nondiscriminatory conditions for trade in energy materials, products and energy-related equipment based on WTO rules…, the resolution of disputes between participating states…, the promotion of energy efficiency, and attempts to minimize the environmental impact of energy production and use.” There are a number of related documents that besides the consolidated Energy Charter Treaty,1  1 Includes understandings, declarations and decisions contained in the Final Act of 1994, and changes introduced by the Protocol of Correction of 2 August 1996.   include The International Energy Charter of May 20, 2015, The European Energy Charter of December 17, 1991, and the Protocol on Energy Efficiency and Related Environmental Aspects of December 17, 1994. Energy obligations are included in multinational sustainable development and green growth documents–UN resolutions, Council of the European Union, and European Commission documents (Council of the European Union 2017 ; EUR-Lex, 2013  and other). Unlike environmental issues, energy problems often cause more polarized views, creating obstacles for multinational agreements. Thus, energy agreements and international agreements that incorporate energy targets are typically less binding, have smaller membership, or concluded at regional level. For instance, the International  Energy Charter Treaty has 53 signatories, while Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, Montreal Protocol, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UN Convention to Combat Desertification, Convention on Biological Diversity, and Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (Sustainable Development Goals 2030) have over 190 signatories. Overall, the universal nature of international energy and environmental agreements creates a level playing field for all countries around the world. Even though universal agreements are more difficult to agree upon and they are typically more general, they lower perceived risks of zero-sum game and provide a much more significant outcome. Universal agreements also offer a solid framework for discussions, information exchange, and cooperation around energy and environmental security issues for all parties involved. If all countries are in, no states would feel discriminated against or attempt to be a free rider. Whenever it is not possible or feasible to conclude universal agreements, regional or local treaties are made. Undoubtedly, they resolve significant security matters, while at the same may create tensions with other countries. Moreover, close regional energy integration may decrease the demand for cumulative installed capacity and decrease negative geographic and socio-environmental impacts due to resource optimization and greenhouse emissions mitigation (Santos, 2021 ). However, this conclusion may be region-specific and may not apply to some regions. For example, a study of intraregional trade among the South Asian economies points to a negative interlink between trade increase and renewable energy consumption (Murshed, 2021 ). Lessons learned from the past agreements (i.e., the Millennium Development Goals, the Kyoto Protocol) are relevant for the treaties and declarations that came to replace them (SDGs, The Paris Agreement). The criticism of these documents focuses on incentives for participation and compliance, and several issues have to be taken into account in future accords. First, universal global goals need to be tailored for each country and rely on specific policy, environmental, economic, and social context. The value of this approach is to make high-level and general targets relevant and specific for each country; ambitious, but achievable. The challenge of this approach is to make sure that these national goals and targets that nation-states set for themselves are high enough, and countries are not imitating progress toward common goals. Second, they have to be supplemented by national action plans with clear division of responsibility, allocation of financial resources, cross-sectoral and interdepartmental coordination, and cross-country cooperation to address transboundary issues. Third, there should be different approaches to countries depending on their level of development (GDP per capita) and the volume of emissions. Finally, national and regional level goals and targets should be designed to ensure accountability. Not all agreements preview a mechanism to enforce compliance with commitments. Additional difficulty is to gather high-quality data to monitor progress in implementation and compare these data across countries (Philibert, 2004 ; Diniz, 2007 ; UNECE, 2015 ).   3 Harmonizing environmental and energy policies from the security perspective As noted in Section 1 , the energy and environmental policy-making process is similar and could be unified. As stated in Section 2 , many environmental and energy targets set in multilateral agreements are closely connected. This section looks into various approaches to harmonizing environmental and energy security policies at institutional and instrumental levels.  There is a set of security factors in energy policy that may contradict those in environmental policy: the need to provide affordable energy for all; budget constraints and the choice of economically feasible energy sources (energy technologies); social and economic acceptability by various stakeholders; the need to assure accessible energy; and good governance (Indriyanto et al., 2011 ). To give some examples, the dirtiest energy carrier—coal—may be the most affordable and economically feasible energy resource in certain locations. Environment and climate friendly large windmills may face protests from local communities, and certain territories covered by solar panels may be alternatively used for agriculture. Access to energy could imply more high-voltage transmission lines or gas pipelines across an area that may be regarded as problem by local dwellers or have negative implications for nature and wildlife. Social acceptance of certain energy technologies (like nuclear) may also significantly limit policy options. There are several approaches to harmonizing energy and environmental policies, while assuring security considerations for both domains. Often these issues are grouped under the overarching “sustainability” topic. First is the integration of environment and energy policy-making under one administration (government agency). Second, close interdepartmental cooperation could help government agencies responsible for energy and environment to achieve coherence of both agencies' policies. This could be done through governmental commissions or consultations. Third, one document (international agreement, law, regulation, etc.) could cover both energy and environmental domains, as well as joint security implications. These options are discussed below and illustrated with Fig. 22.2  . The integration of environment and energy policy-making under one administration is an attempt to eliminate some of the inherent contradictions at institutional level. Some international organizations and national authorities organize special units that integrate energy and environment policy-making. A good example here is the US Department of Agriculture that set up the Office of Energy and  Environmental Policy (OEEP). OEEP is a focal point that integrates the Department's energy, environmental, and climate change activities and assures harmonized energy and environmental policy analysis, long-term planning, research priority setting, and response strategies. This single unit accommodates the Office of Environmental Markets (OEM), the Climate Change Program Office (CCPO), and Energy Policy and New Uses (OEPNU). The range of issues covered by OEEP is vast and includes the development of renewable energy and resources; construction of climate resilient and sustainable farms, rural lands, and rural communities; expansion of markets for conservation and environmental goods, and more (US Department of Agriculture, 2021 ). Close interdepartmental cooperation is an option when setting up a single energy and environment administration is not deemed possible or feasible. For example, in Russia, the Commission for Strategic Development of the Fuel and Energy Sector and Environmental Security was established to assure interdepartmental cooperation, to coordinate the administrative efforts at federal, regional, and local levels in advancing the energy sector; ensuring industrial, energy, and environmental security; and the rational use or resources. Among the issues discussed at the Committee meetings are the wide application of cutting-edge technologies in coal mining to increase efficiency and safety. The industry should comply with stringent environmental standards along the entire supply chain from mining to coal-handling places, including sea ports, to ensure improvements in quality of life and health, as well as urban environment (President of Russia, 2021 ). At the instrumental level, policy-makers tend to integrate energy security concerns in environmental legal and regulatory documents and vice versa. For example, Canada has developed Defense Energy and Environment Strategies (DEES) to integrate energy efficiency and sustainability in the activities of the Department of National Defense (DND) and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). DEES is harmonized with a range of other national documents related to sustainable development, green growth, and climate, as well as international agreements such as the 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The latest strategy outlines priorities for 2020–2023 and focuses on sustainable use of defense assets, such as land and buildings; green procurement; investments in green technologies and nontechnological innovations; and input in Canada's goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 (Government of Canada, 2017 ). In addition to the three approaches to harmonizing energy and environmental policies described above, certain efforts may be applied by international organizations. For instance, the IEA has followed several strategies since 2015. The organization attempted to widen its membership beyond the OECD base, and involve new members, including emerging economies. The IEA also sought to broaden its mandate so that it covers clean energy transition and issues of interest to the new member states, such as energy access. It also attempted to increase its influence at the international arena, in particular, through partnerships with other forums, such as G20 (Downie, 2020 ). With the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, international organizations initiate policies to help their member states in preserving energy and environmental security simultaneously. For instance, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has issued a note summarizing the analytical and research work on energy security and resilience for implementation of the 2030 Agenda. ESCAP approaches energy and environmental security in the context of international cooperation related to integration of new technologies, platforms, and frameworks, and addressing associated resilience challenges. The reviewed research serves as a basis for the development of evidence-based energy security and resilience policy in the region (ESCAP, 2021 ).   4 Universalism, regionalism, or nation-state protectionism: what is the future of international relations around energy and environment? With the appearance of new challenges, energy and environmental security experiences more pressure than ever before. Traditionally, security issues have been handled at international and national levels. However, in recent years, there is an increasing influence of subnational and virtual organizations, i.e., cyber terrorism. Not only security issues but also economic and governance issues are increasingly handled at subnational level, thus contributing to greater regionalization. The changing balance of power among global, middle, and regional states and world regions also have an impact for energy and environmental security. Global powers (world powers and superpowers) are typically characterized by superiority in military, economic, and political power in addition to geographic outreach (O'Loughlin, 2009 ). They address global security challenges related to price and supply stability at global energy markets, international trade of energy resources and energy technologies, and international energy cooperation. Other global challenges include, but not limited to rising capital needs and misinformation in the energy industry, energy and environmental aspects of rising vehicle use, rising global energy demand and the impact of largest world energy consumers (e.g., China and India), energy poverty, nuclear technologies proliferation, global environment and climate (and related clean energy) targets, resource scarcity, and the deployment of energy infrastructure (Dorian et al., 2006 ). The examples of superpowers are the United States and USSR during the Cold War period and the British Empire at the end of the 19th century. Global incidents of market failure make up rationale for global public policy interventions and actions related to energy security. At least four key areas should be subject to global public policy regulation in the energy sphere: “market transparency and planning security; negative spill-over effects of a global scale; free rider problems; and the existence of global market imbalances caused by cartels” (Sovacool, 2011 ). With regard to environment and climate, global governance should be exercised in relation to any issues of planetary or interregional scale, as all environmental issues may be classified as public good. Having this in mind, it should be noted that there is an inherent collective action problem related to investments in energy infrastructure aimed at increasing energy security due to its public goods character (Sovacool, 2011 ). The terms “middle powers” and “regional powers” are somewhat vaguer, and their meanings are debatable. Middle powers (or major powers) are typically referred to states that have somewhat less power in the international arena than superpowers. Although these states lack superpower capabilities, they still exercise significant influence and possess the capacity necessary to shape international relations. The examples of middle powers are Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China, and Germany. The middle powers cannot act on their own (as superpowers do) and rely on alliances with other states and “niche diplomacy” to influence global politics in many aspects including energy and environment (Yilmaz, 2019 ). Regional powers exercise their influence within a certain geographic region. The regional power capabilities cannot be challenged by any other country in its region making it the regional hegemon. The regional powers shape regional energy and environment security agendas. Regional alliances are instrumental in addressing environmental issues (i.e., a river and its basin) or energy resources (OPEC countries) limited to a certain locality (Yilmaz, 2019 ). Examples of regional powers are the Mexico, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.  One example of regional alliances with an energy security agenda is the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). The EEU seeks to create common energy markets for oil and petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity. The close cooperation in the energy area is driven by economic, policy, and development issues. EEU's development institution—the Eurasian Development Bank—provides funds for projects that benefit member states, such as those related to green energy, energy access, and energy security (Bianco et al., 2021 ). As stated in the EEU 2025 Strategy, “one of integration priorities shall be the improvement of energy saving and energy efficiency, the resolution of existing environmental problems, and the ensuring of sustainable development” (Eurasian Economic Council, 2020 ). Within larger countries, policy-makers and researchers also differentiate between various regions that have diverse energy mix, energy supply and demand, and environmental issues. In countries like the United States of America, Canada, China, and Russia, certain regions may be energy poor and other regions may generate the bulk of national energy resources, some regions may accommodate large energy consumers, while others may be sparsely populated with few small economic actors (Proskuryakova, 2017 ). Researchers employ the concept of “energy regions” with regard to regions within a country to indicate common policy approach based on long-term visions that frame short-term objectives and policy evaluation. These “guiding visions” play an important role in energy transition management for mobilizing social actors and the interagency coordination (Späth and Rohracher, 2010 ). Over two decades starting from the year 2000 trends in international relations suggested more regionalism and nation-state protectionism in dealing with energy and environment security. This statement may be illustrated with new OPEC and OPEC + deals, the inability of international community (and the largest emitters) to agree on a new climate change accord, and many countries failing to meet the Paris Agreement goals. The US President Biden announced in 2021 ambitious plans to decrease emissions by 50%–52% below the 2005 level by 2030, thus doubling the commitment of the previous administration. If this happens, it will be done outside the Paris Agreement, as the United States ceased its participation in 2017. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries faced new challenges related to economic slowdown, overburden of national healthcare systems, and a major decline in international trade (UNCTAD, 2020 ). Energy systems have also experienced difficulties due to a drop in demand, lower prices, deterrent and nonpayments, and disconnection bans (Proskuryakova et al., 2021 ). These changes contributed to a more prominent role of nation-states and greater concerns about energy security. Environment pollution and greenhouse gas emissions have reduced due to decreasing economic activity, and this triggered discussions about a more ambitious and consistent green growth strategy (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ). Green recovery is particularly visible in the financial markets (Naeem et al., 2021 ), agriculture, tourism, energy, and a few others (Ranjbari et al., 2021 ). Even though the recent developments contributed to the advancement of regionalism and nation-state protectionism, the future of energy and environment security is associated with universal agreements. Institutional settings that regulate energy and environmental security should be treated as transnational public goods and require global cooperative efforts. Researchers note that public character of energy security may limit coordination in other areas of global governance, such as climate change and environment pollution (Valdes, 2021 ). Therefore, energy, climate, and environment security in the global security policy agenda should be treated together, in a coherent and comprehensive manner.   5 Conclusions Over the past decades, energy and environmental policy have been closely integrated. Moreover, there is an interlink with other policy domains, such as economic policy and foreign and security policy. Although policy agenda in this area is mainly set by government agencies, businesses and civil society are also active players. Environmental and energy issues have been connected not only in policy-making but also in research and public discourse. The national and international policy-making cycle in energy and environmental security is similar to that in other policy domains. The differences are associated with the necessity to integrate security concerns that in certain cases may be opposite for energy and environment. This integration may be pursued through international agreements, common energy and environment administration, interdepartmental cooperation, and common strategic documents. Additionally, international organizations could also make an input in addressing this challenge. There are clear benefits in concluding universal energy and environmental agreements. Besides setting the harmonized energy and environmental goals common for most countries around the world, they lower the probability of zero-sum game and free rider risks, limit discrimination, and result in more substantial outcomes. These agreements provide a basis for discussions, information exchange, and cooperation around energy and environmental security issues for all signatories. Regional agreements may also result in security gains for countries involved, including a more optimal use of resources and production capacities among member states, while at the same time may create tensions with the third parties. The changes in economy, trade, and society that became visible over the last decades contributed to a more prominent role of nation-states and greater concerns about energy security. There has also been a growing trend toward regionalization. At the same time, the future of energy and environment security is associated with universalism and global accords. The public goods nature of both energy and environment, grand challenges that international community faces (climate, pandemic, etc.), and the need to address them in most efficient and timely manner are the arguments in favor of this approach.
