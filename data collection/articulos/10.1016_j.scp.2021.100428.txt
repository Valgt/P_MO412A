                  Water and wastewater treatment plants were not developed to remove pharmaceuticals from effluents. Consequently, pharmaceutical residues are being detected in many ecosystems worldwide. Pharmaceutical pollution is a diffuse issue that has the potential to unbalance ecosystems. It is a complex environmental problem that involves all sectors of society. In this article, we present: (1) an evaluation of the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) considering pharmaceutical pollution as a case study; (2) a narrative review regarding legislation of pharmaceutical disposal of several countries; and, finally, (3) reflections concerning alternatives for better management aiming to reduce pharmaceutical pollution. Regarding these three main aims, we found that: (1) pharmaceutical pollution is still a problem, so we are going against SDGs from this point of view (2) the lack of drug disposal regulation in some countries may have a global impact and harm many ecosystems worldwide; (3) the solutions indicated here would integrate the management and help to reduce drug pollution, consequently, moving towards SGDs.

Also, such waste should not be placed in the domestic collection service (EPA, 2003). Because that policy is not for the whole country, the Australian Government (Department of Health) funded the “Return Unwanted Medicines Project” in 1998, which is a national community pharmacy network aimed to collect unwanted or overdue drugs (Glassmeyer et al., 2009; Wheeler 2017). After collection, the drugs are sent to the Environmental Protection Authority and incinerated at high temperatures for elimination (Murdoch 2015).The member states of the European Union shall ensure appropriate collection systems for medical products that are unused or have expired (Directive 2004/27/EC). The European Union also has some strategies for handling pharmaceutical pollution, such as understanding the pharmaceutical fate in the environment, awareness of rational use and support the development of less environmentally harmful pharmaceuticals (European Comission, 2019).This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) - Finance Code 001, Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) and Innovation Department at the State University of Rio de Janeiro (InovUerj), linked to the Sub-Dean of Graduate Studies and Research.

Water and wastewater treatment plants were not developed to remove pharmaceuticals from effluents. Consequently, pharmaceutical residues are being detected in many ecosystems worldwide. Pharmaceutical pollution is a diffuse issue that has the potential to unbalance ecosystems. It is a complex environmental problem that involves all sectors of society. In this article, we present: (1) an evaluation of the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) considering pharmaceutical pollution as a case study; (2) a narrative review regarding legislation of pharmaceutical disposal of several countries; and, finally, (3) reflections concerning alternatives for better management aiming to reduce pharmaceutical pollution. Regarding these three main aims, we found that: (1) pharmaceutical pollution is still a problem, so we are going against SDGs from this point of view (2) the lack of drug disposal regulation in some countries may have a global impact and harm many ecosystems worldwide; (3) the solutions indicated here would integrate the management and help to reduce drug pollution, consequently, moving towards SGDs.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Disposal  Legislation  Solutions  Medicines    1 Introduction Humankind has created several synthetic chemicals over the years that have the potential to affect and change the environment negatively. Bernhardt et al. (2017)  showed that synthetic chemicals are increasing more rapidly than other global change agents, such as atmospheric CO2  concentrations, nutrient pollution, and biodiversity loss. Emerging pollutants, for example, present a significant environmental concern since they are not commonly monitored in the environment and have the potential to cause ecological disturbances and human health effects (Tang et al., 2019 ). Pharmaceuticals are a relevant class of emerging pollutants. The pharmaceutical consumption is associated with population growth and their environmental occurrence has implications for human and environmental health (Quadra et al., 2017 ; Klatte et al., 2017 ). Pharmaceuticals reach sewage by human excretion and they are not completely removed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (Alvarino et al., 2018 ; Patel et al., 2019 ). Therefore, pharmaceuticals are reaching the environment continuously and they have been found in different aquatic ecosystems globally (aus der Beek et al., 2016 ; Mezzelani et al., 2019 ). The incorrect disposal of medicines in trash, toilets or sinks, as well as industrial effluents and veterinary application, are other potential sources of pharmaceuticals to the environment (Quadra et al., 2017 ; Klatte et al., 2017 ). Pharmaceuticals in the environment, even at low concentrations, are capable of causing toxic effects in organisms (Xin et al., 2020 ; Chaturvedi et al., 2021 ). In general, most studies regarding pharmaceuticals present occurrence data or ecotoxicological effects. These data are fundamental to understand the consequences of this complex environmental issue. However, gathering information to assess the human management behind drug use and its associated environmental consequences is equally important. Therefore, the aims of this work are: (1) reflect about the achievement of the UN's proposed sustainable development goals (SDGs) using pharmaceutical pollution as a case study; (2) compile legislation of different countries to understand the gaps regarding medicines disposal management; and (3) point out solutions that may help fill the gaps regarding the causes of drug pollution and, consequently, move towards the SDGs. The present work results are important to fill the gaps about the reasons for drugs reaching the environment and how to overcome them, avoiding environmental imbalances and potential public health issues.Aim 1 The relationship between pharmaceutical pollution and sustainable development goals. At the United Nations Conference in 2012, 17 sustainable development objectives were proposed as well as indicators that will be used by UN member states over the next 15 years (Glaser 2012 ; Hák et al., 2016 ). The SDGs involve the global urgencies that encompass economic, environmental, and social factors (Sachs 2012 ). Pollution has been a challenge for sustainable development and pharmaceutical pollution has direct implications in the environmental, economic and social spheres, which are considered the triad for sustainable development.Goal 3: Ensuring a healthy life and promoting well-being for all at all ages    Humankind life expectancy has been increasing with the advance of medicine and the pharmaceutical industry is essential for human health. However, the non-rational use of medicines may harm environmental health with the potential to cause public health issues. The medicines consumption generally increases while humans are getting old since the immunological system does not work at the same efficiency and the incidence of chronic diseases enhances. Therefore, polypharmacy becomes a key element, which is the use of five or more drugs simultaneously, in some cases without a prescription (Aguirre et al., 2017 ; Thorel et al., 2020 ). However, the interaction of different drugs may cause adverse effects and researchers showed the correlation between polypharmacy and increased hospital admissions (Molokhia and Majeed 2017 ). Consequently, polypharmacy may favor treatment abandonment due to adverse effects and, then, the accumulation of unused drugs. Still concerning medicines consumption, the irrational use of antibiotics has already proved to contribute to bacterial resistance (Zaman et al., 2017 ), leading to the reduction of pharmaceuticals' therapeutic efficiency (Gothwal and Shashidhar 2014 ). Consequently, the potential public health risk has become a global challenge (Klatte et al., 2017 ).Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all    Depending on the persistence, polarity, and solubility in water, pharmaceuticals are not entirely removed from WWTPs (Patel et al., 2019 ). More worrying is the fact that many countries still lack proper sanitation. In 2015, more than 5 billion people did not have access to safe sanitation services (WHO 2017 ), which means that more than 50% of the world's sewage goes straight into the environment with a complex pool of contaminants, including drugs, that did not pass through any attenuation. Therefore, pharmaceuticals reach soils, surface water, groundwater, sediments and even drinking water (aus der Beek et al., 2016 ).Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns    Considering the economic factor, it is noteworthy that the drug market moves a lot of money annually worldwide (IQVIA, 2019 ) with a trend of increasing continuously to supply the population growth and the inversion of the population age pyramid (Quadra et al., 2017 ; Kasonga et al., 2021 ). In Brazil, for example, the per capita drug consumption is also increasing (Quadra et al., 2017 ). Consequently, as pharmaceuticals are not completely removed from WWTPs (Park et al., 2017 ) and in many countries, medicines are not properly disposed of (Quijano-Prieto et al., 2016 ; Ayele and Mamu, 2018 ; Quadra et al., 2019 ; Naser et al., 2020 ), human consumption will have a more significant impact on the environment in the coming years.Goal 13: Action against global climate change    Some classes of returned medicines go through incineration, which depends on each country's regulation. However, open burning is still a common practice, mainly in developing countries, where the waste is not separate at all. Open burning of healthcare waste is a potential source of carbon and other contaminants such as dioxins and furans (WHO 1999 ; Babanyara et al., 2013 ; Raila 2017 ). Black carbon, for example, may intensify global warming due to its capacity to absorb solar energy and increase dark cloud formation, decreasing its ability to reflect sunlight (DeAngelis 2011 ). Goal 14: Conserving and sustainably using oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development and Goal 15: Protecting, restoring and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, manage forests sustainably, combat desertification and stop and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss.    Drugs are designed to cause-specific biological effects at low concentrations and, therefore, have the potential to cause huge damage to organisms in the environment (Arnold et al., 2014 ). The ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceuticals have already been described for many aquatic and terrestrial species. Pharmaceuticals have the potential to cause major ecological imbalances. For example, the study by Oaks et al. (2004)  found that diclofenac caused renal failure and visceral gout resulted in the decline of the population of oriental white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis, Gyps indicus  and Gyps tenuirostris) , leading to a population decline, a striking environmental effect.  Aim 2 An overview of national disposal legislations As mentioned and exemplified in the previous topic, pharmaceutical pollution is not in line with the SDGs. To achieve sustainable development, the pharmaceutical residues must be properly managed. The incorrect disposal of pharmaceuticals involves decentralized legislation and the lack of information by society (Santos et al., 2010 ). Therefore, we reviewed the national laws present in the countries with the highest drug market according to Glassmeyer et al. (2009) .   1.1 Argentina Argentina establishes medicines return by the national decree n° 1.299/97  and the resolution 522/2016  provides measures for the correct management of household medicines referred as “Residues of special generation”. The National Medicines Policy is an effective program for optimizing drug use in the Argentine health system, which is a real intervention from the government to bring information to the health system and patients (Cangenova 2006 ).  1.2 Australia In South Australia, the disposal of medical waste is controlled by the Environment Protection Policy (Environment Protection Act, 1993 ), ensuring that people who generate medical waste should not cause environmental or human harm. Also, such waste should not be placed in the domestic collection service (EPA, 2003). Because that policy is not for the whole country, the Australian Government  (Department of Health ) funded the “Return Unwanted Medicines Project ” in 1998, which is a national community pharmacy network aimed to collect unwanted or overdue drugs (Glassmeyer et al., 2009 ; Wheeler 2017 ). After collection, the drugs are sent to the Environmental Protection Authority and incinerated at high temperatures for elimination (Murdoch 2015 ).  1.3 Brazil Decree n° 10.388/2020  was approved in Brazil, which includes medicines and their packages for human use, expired or in disuse in the reverse logistics system. In the Decree, the manufacturers, importers, distributors, traders, and consumers are responsible for implementing. It will initially include states and municipalities with a population greater than 500.000 inhabitants and, later, municipalities with a population greater than 100.000 inhabitants. Some municipalities already had legislation for the correct disposal of medicines by consumers (e.g., Law n° 13.442/2016 ; Law n° 17.211/2012 ; Law n° 13.905/2012 ). About the drug disposal program, Brazil does not have any national coverage. However, some initiatives, such as the conscious disposal program, have collection points in some Brazilian states (Descarte Consciente, 2021 : https://www.descarteconsciente.com.be/pontos-de-coleta ).  1.4 Canada There is no national provision program for the public in Canada. Anyway, there is the Ontario Regulation n° 298/12 , where producers must collect and dispose of pharmaceuticals brought by consumers, as well as the collection, recycling and/or disposal of their packages (Regulation n° 298/12, 1990 ). There are a variety of programs established at the provincial, municipal, and community level (Gagnon 2009 ). For example, in Alberta, pharmacies receive correct disposal instructions through the (Return Old or Unused Medications for Environmentally Friendly Disposal, 2021 : https://rxa.ca/member-benefits/envirx/ ) program. This program is funded by the Alberta Pharmacists' Association, with donations from Innovative Medicines Canada and the Health Products Stewardship Association  (Alberta Pharmacists’ Association, 2021 : https://emeraldfoundation.ca/aef_awards/envirx/ ). The “Medications Return Program” of the British Columbia province dedicates efforts to collect unused or expired medicines from people before going to the garbage. They receive all prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and natural health products. Health Products Stewardship Association manages the “Medications Return Program” since 1999 and is an initiative regulated explicitly in the Recycling Regulation (Regulation n°449/2004 , Gagnon 2009 ).  1.5 Japan In 2006, the Planning Conference and Resource Saving & Waste Management Groups collaborated with the Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations of Japan (FPMAJ ) to promote solid waste disposal in the pharmaceutical industry (Hanashi 2011 ). In 2008, the Academic Committee of the Japan Hospital Pharmacist Association and the Environmental Safety Committee of the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Japan released a document with guidelines for disposing of hospital waste (Pharmaceutical Packaging and Container Disposal Guide, 2007 ), especially pharmaceutical containers and packages. These products must be incinerated if the pharmaceutical products are inside the package and recycled or disposed of the empty ones. According to Glassmeyer et al. (2009) , Japan ranks second among twelve nations in the pharmaceutical market. Consumers in Japan are advised to dispose of medical waste, including pharmaceuticals, in their household garbage (JPMA 2007 ). In 2014, Sanofi Company started the first program for the disposal of unused or expired medicines for members and 60% of employees participated in the first year (Sanofi, 2017).  1.6 Mexico The General Law for prevention and integral management of residues in Mexico as well as the general health law establishes the producers' responsibility of proper disposal of the waste generated to ensure environmental protection (Gracia-Vásquez et al., 2015 ; Guzmán et al., 2019 ; General Law, 2015; General Law 2021 ). The Official Mexican Standard (NOM-052-SEMARNAT, 2005 ) establishes the characteristics, the identification procedure, classification and the list of dangerous waste, including residues from pharmaceutical chemistry. Mexico has a national plan led by the health sector and pharmacy industry, where they are responsible for the management of expired medicines in the entire commercial chain (COFEPRIS, 2012 ; Jáuregui-Medina et al., 2015 ). The National Management System of Residues of Medicines and Packages has collectors for medicines disposal covering 72% of the country's states (Jáuregui-Medina et al., 2015 ;Singrem, 2021  :http://www.singrem.org.mx/contenedoresSeguros.html ).  1.7 New Zealand Although the Medicines Regulations 1984 (Regulations n°143/1984 , updated in 2020) established that the General Director might request the destruction of medicines for any manufacturer or drugstore, there is no national policy for medicines disposal in New Zealand (Tong et al., 2011a ; Bisset, 2019 ). However, the country has the Disposal of Unwanted Medicines Properly Project (2020), encouraging society to return the medicines for the pharmacies. Moreover, the country also holds a program to distribute medicines for people who needs them worldwide by showing a prescription (Medical Aid Abrod, 2021 : : https://maa.org.nz/about ). Although the country has many programs for medicines disposal and distribution, a wide-range policy would help create public awareness and avoid environmental issues (Murdoch 2015 ).  1.8 United States The disposal of pharmaceuticals in the United States is regulated by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (Brechtelsbauer and Shah 2020 ). In 2019, the EPA published the Final Rule of Management Standards for Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals intended to change the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulation of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019 ; Brechtelsbauer and Shah 2020 ). One aim is to avoid the pharmaceutical residues to reach the wastewater effluents due to the old practice of discarding medicines in the toilet (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019 ; Brechtelsbauer and Shah 2020 ). All the states have until July 2021 to adopt the final rule. All healthcare facilities and all reverse distributors should comply with the new rule managing all kinds of pharmaceuticals, except for small establishments with conditional exemption (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019 ; Brechtelsbauer and Shah 2020 ). The new EPA rule set the sewer prohibition, where pharmaceuticals may not be discarded in drain or toilet. However, the new rule did not include household generation of pharmaceutical waste, maintaining the take back programs and events managed by each state (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019 ; Brechtelsbauer and Shah 2020 ).  1.9 United Kingdom Disposal of medical products in the United Kingdom is covered by Controlled Waste Regulation (1992) (HMSO, 1992), and clinical waste is controlled by Special Waste Regulation (1996) (HMSO, 1996; Bound and Voulvoulis 2005 ). According to this Law, such waste can be disposed of in landfills specifically designed for this type of waste or may be incinerated. The country also has an Action Plan elaborate in 2012 to minimize waste and improve drug use, such as encouraging the society to return medicines in pharmacies rather than stocking them (Government of United kingdom, 2012 ). Besides, the country also has pharmaceutical collection events held by National Health Service (NHS) (Kusturica et al., 2016 ). Pharmacies in the United Kingdom are obliged to take back unwanted and unused medicines brought by patients and return these to the NHS. The system only covers household waste and the local authorities are responsible for the final disposal and promote awareness campaigns (Health Care Without Harm 2013 ). The campaign encourages people to request only the pharmaceuticals that will be used to avoid waste generation (Medicine Waste UK, 2021 : http://www.medicinewaste.com/campaign ). In the United Kingdom, pharmacies and veterinary clinics can denature pharmaceutical residues according to their classification before disposal (UKGuidance, 2021 : https://www.gov.uk/guidance/waste-exemption-t28-sort-and-denature-controlled-drugs-for-disposal ).  1.10 Member states belonging to the European Union The member states of the European Union shall ensure appropriate collection systems for medical products that are unused or have expired (Directive 2004/27/EC ). The European Union  also has some strategies for handling pharmaceutical pollution, such as understanding the pharmaceutical fate in the environment, awareness of rational use and support the development of less environmentally harmful pharmaceuticals (European Comission, 2019 ). 1.10.1 France In France, Decree no  92-377  had designated the packers' responsibility for the disposal of packaging waste. The French Law n° 248/2007  established that the pharmacies must receive unused pharmaceuticals (Law n° 248/2007 ). Moreover, France operates a structured industry-funded system for recalling pharmaceutical waste (Macarthur et al., 2000 ; Defarges 2020 ). The collaborative system includes manufacturers, wholesalers and community pharmacies carried out by Cyclamed (Macarthur et al., 2000 ). Cyclamed has contributed to the reduction of unused pharmaceuticals in France (Defarges 2020 ).  1.10.2 Germany Updated in 2012, the German Waste Management Act established prevention and recycling to mitigate the waste impacts on the environment and human health (Germany Federal Environmental Agency, 2014 ). Although there is no specific regulation for medicine disposal, according to the Germany Federal Environmental Agency, pharmaceutical products can be disposed of in collection points or ordinary garbage since most of the waste is incinerated in the country Arzneimittel-Entsorgung richtig gemacht, 2021 : https://arzneimittelentsorgung.de/hom ).  1.10.3 Italy In Italy, decree n° 254/2003  encourages the authorities to reduce, recycle and, whenever possible, recover waste at the final destination. The Associazione Indennizzo Resi (Assinde) is responsible for managing the collection of unused drugs (Costa et al., 2018 ). In the country, unused drugs are received in specific collectors in pharmacies, health centers, streets, and collection sites, depending on the municipality (Health Care Without Harm 2013 ). Municipalities can rely on public or private partnerships to manage and pay the costs involved in collecting and disposing of medicines. Italy was one of the first European countries to present a collection and disposal of drugs in the late 70's (Hiratuka et al., 2013 ).  1.10.4 Spain In Spain, Royal Decree n° 1345/2007  establishes the pharmaceutical sellers' responsibility to collect drugs from the household. Law n° 29/2006  determines that the medicine packages have the authorization symbol of the Spanish Agency for medicines and health products to assist the collection process. Spain also has Law n° 22/2011  - the general Law on solid waste and contaminated soils -, where the authorities do waste disposal in a way that does not impact the environment and public health. The country has a reverse logistics program for medicines (Bellan et al., 2012 ). In 2002, the Integrated waste packaging management system was established by the Spanish National Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry, according to the Directive 94/62/CEE based on the expanded responsibility for medicine disposal management (Directive 94/62/CEE ; Hiratuka et al., 2013 ). The system collects unused, overdue, and even empty boxes of medicines (Coma et al., 2008; SIGRE, 2021 :https://sigre.es/conocenos#que-es-sigre ). The country also has awareness campaigns (Medsdisposal) to inform society about the correct disposal of drugs that involves some countries in Europe (MedsDisposal, 2021 : http://medsdisposal.eu ).  Critical evaluation of disposal legislation and consequences   It was observed that legislation is diverse among the studied countries. In a general form, laws between countries differ ranging from federal legislation to more regional regulations or even an apparent lack of regulations. Most of the countries legislations shared the stablishment of collection points and the final disposal as landfills and/or incineration. The member states of the European Union stand out, since they have national regulations as well as medicine collection programs, sharing the management responsibility among all the sectors of society. Indeed, involving all social sectors in the management, such as manufacturers, distributors, prescribers, pharmacists, and public health authorities, is one way to reduce pharmaceutical pollution (Smale et al., 2021 ). Brazil has a recent national regulation and some regional regulations, but there is still a lack of connection between the commercial chain, i.e.,  from the production to final disposition (Oliveira et al., 2019 ). In addition, Brazil has many small cities not covered by the new national legislation. Moreover, awareness campaigns are crucial since ~66% of Brazilians discard expired medicines in the common garbage (Quadra et al., 2019 ). Among the countries with more punctual legislation, Australia and Canada have regulations at a regional scale and collection programs, but pharmaceutical disposal legislation is decentralized. Regional and local initiatives are essential, but national management may help achieve effective actions across the country. Despite being one of the pharmaceutical market leaders, Japan relies on the producers for medicine disposal management, which is risky as community participation is crucial to ensure proper disposal. There is a concern about the most populous countries, like China and India, which seem to lack legislation. While in India, the National Formulary (NFI 2011 ) explains the correct disposal of drugs, an effluent from an Indian wastewater treatment contained the highest levels of pharmaceuticals reported in any effluent (Larsson et al., 2007 ; Balakrishna et al., 2017 ). In China, the review carried out by Liu et al., (2018)  showed high levels of pharmaceutical products in different environmental compartments. Most worrying is that the population is getting older, which means more drug consumption (Belloni et al., 2016), and more significant pollution potential. Although many countries have legislation, even at a regional scale, as well as collection programs, the lack of a global standard for the collection and correct disposal of medicines has environmental impacts. aus der Beek et al. (2016 ) showed that pharmaceuticals are a global concern, although there is still a lack of data from many countries. Moreover, in general, the legislation does not include environmental monitoring and inspections to check the procedure efficiency. The pharmaceutical industry brings many benefits to humankind, but it is necessary to prevent, reduce, and manage the medicines' production, consumption, and destination. Initiatives, such as the German UBA (2018)  with the “Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management”, are crucial to understand and manage pharmaceuticals globally. Organic pollutants, including some pharmaceuticals, can be transported over long distances, which can be evidenced by the detection of various compounds in non-urbanized areas, such as the poles (Gonzalez-Alonso et al., 2017 ; Kallenborn et al., 2018 ). Then, pharmaceuticals pollution is a global issue and needs more effort to control. Aim 3 Measures to go towards SDGs Many technological initiatives have been adopted worldwide to reduce pharmaceutical pollution, but some simpler initiatives, such as campaigns for the correct disposal of medicines or avoiding polypharmacy in older people, may be very effective in minimizing the risks. It is suggested a global cooperation sharing investment in research to a better understanding of pharmaceuticals in the environment and share technologies. Therefore, an international agreement for the reduction and mitigation of pharmaceutical pollution would benefit the entire population, while the lack of it is generating cascading effects reaching human and environmental health. It often seems that we are following opposite paths considering pharmaceutical pollution as a study case and the SDGs. Therefore, we suggested some measures and solutions associated with goals 9, 11 and 17, related to the industry, innovation and infrastructure, sustainable cities and communities, and partnerships (UN 2014 ).   Klatte et al. (2017)  already summarized some measures to reduce pharmaceuticals in the environment. First of all, it is necessary to review the entire process, from the pharmaceutical production to the prescribers, the consumer, and the final destination, rather than only the final disposal as considered in many national regulations. It is required that doctors and health professionals understand the issue and guide the patients into conscious consumption. Moreover, effluent monitoring, whether industrial or domestic, is essential to ensure that they are free of pharmaceutical residues. Since drugs are not entirely removed in water and sewage treatment plants nowadays, it is crucial to support new technologies to remove these substances. The recent reviews by Kanakaraju et al. (2018) , Mansour et al. (2018)  and Rosman et al. (2018)  describe drug removal technologies, mainly focusing on adsorption on activated carbons and advanced oxidation processes that employ ozone, ultraviolet radiation, gamma radiation and electro-oxidation. Some methods contemplated by those reviews present a removal potential up to 100% for some drugs. Although these techniques require a high operational cost, some countries already use them, such as Germany, Switzerland, and Sweden (Baresel et al., 2019 ). The support for these technologies must be political since they have a significant social impact. However, the issue is more critical in developing countries since the sewage sometimes is not even collected, then it is also not treated at all. Along with these technologies, the “Ecopharmacovigilance” (EPV) must be widely adopted. EPV is a science and activity field related to the detection, evaluation, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects derived by drug occurrence in the environment (Velo and Moretti 2010 ). Moreover, EPV encourages the design of green drugs, which means the application of green chemistry principles in the development, the reduction of emissions in the factories, and the adoption of best practices for the prescription and management of unused medicines (Holm et al., 2013 ). EPV is similar to the Green Pharmacy concept, which Leder et al.  (2015)  showed, for instance, for β-blocker Metoprolol. In this following scheme, it is possible to observe the correct pathways that drugs should follow, including improving technologies in sewage and water treatment plants, such as those mentioned above (Fig. 1  ). The cycle shown in  Fig. 1A is mainly related to a more controlled prescription of medicines and reverse logistics for these substances, which already exist in some countries. It is based on return programs that collect the products and apply the proper destination. The consumer in this system has an important task to bring the products no longer required to the collection point. Reverse logistics are essential to reduce drug pollution, as well as better management of solid waste (Pereira et al., 2017 ). These programs exist, for instance, in Italy, France, and Australia and are based on a partnership with the government and drugs industries (Macarthur et al., 2000 ; Daughton 2003 ). Like in the United States and New Zealand, there are also drug recycling programs, which aim to redistribute unused drugs to needy people who cannot afford them. In Canada, there are some efforts to recycle drugs, but regulatory or legal obstacles hamper such programs' creation (Doyle 2010 ). Regarding the second cycle (Fig. 1B)it is necessary to mention the need to improve sewage collection systems. In many countries, much of the wastewater is thrown directly into the environment without proper treatment. Then, after improving the sewage collection systems, techniques should be implemented in the treatment plants to remove pharmaceuticals better. Fig. 1 also included the rational use of drugs. The definition of this concept englobes that patients receive the appropriate medication, in doses that meet the treatment, for an adequate time and at the lowest cost for society at all (WHO 1985 ). This concept should be expanded to patients by avoiding self-medicate and follow the complete treatment prescribed by their initiative and responsibility. Still in the domestic cycle, other measures can be adopted by people, as, for instance, having listed all drugs already available at home, so before going to the doctor or drugstore, it would be possible to check what you already have and avoid rebuying the same drug unnecessarily. Besides, mobile apps may be created informing about local drugstores that perform the correct disposal of drugs and instructions concerning the proper disposal in the package or the label of the medicines, besides the pharmacological information. A third main line of action is environmental education. How can such measures be adopted and worked out without the support of environmental education? Examples such as the review by Tong et al. (2011b)  and Kusturica et al. (2016)  showed that people in some countries have the habit of disposing of overdue or unused medicines in toilets, sinks, or garbage. This habit could be related, probably, because people usually do not know the impacts of these substances on the environment or even for themselves. In this line of action, environmental awareness projects are essential, including within schools and universities. Scientific communication regarding medicines disposal accessible for all the society, including children, is highly encouraged (Souza et al., 2019 ). The drug industry should also support advertising campaigns to educate both health professionals and consumers about the environmental problem and health issues associated with drugs and cosmetics, incorrect disposal, or irrational use (Bhati et al., 2013 ). Green Chemistry principles establish a relationship between education, economic and technological advantages, then, investments in this emerging field are necessary. In this field, researchers are studying the design of chemical products and processes to reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances (Anastas et al., 2000 ; Noce 2018 ). Green chemistry was first introduced in the United States, England, and Italy. “The 12 Principles of Green chemistry” developed by Anastas and Warner (1998)  is a manual available to industries that indicates the characteristics necessary to make substances less hazardous to the environment, such as the use of biodegradable substances (Anastas and Warner, 1998 ). Some obstacles have arisen for the implementation of green chemistry in pharmacology. An interview conducted with green chemistry leaders in the United States showed some “regulatory barriers”, one of them is the expensive recertification process when a pharmaceutical company wants to change the production methods (Matus et al., 2012 ). Other measures involving decision-making are regarding free samples that have already been known as a problematic issue when their use is not carefully evaluated, a point that definitely needs to be modified and more supervised (Daughton 2003 ). Moreover, there is a need to study and implement treatments that may reduce the large number of drugs administrated. In addition, research projects regarding the occurrence and effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment should continue existing since they provide legislation information.    2 Summary and future perspectives It seems that we are going against some SDGs, using pharmaceuticals pollution as a study case ( Fig. 2  ) :Goal 3:  pharmaceuticals have been detected in drinking water and bacterial resistance is a current global issue. Both aspects put healthy lives at risk and the application of new technologies in water treatment plants and the conscious use of medicines may help.   Goal 6:  pharmaceuticals are being found everywhere and in relatively high concentrations in developing countries, demonstrating a lack of sanitation and water quality. There is an urgent need to expand sewage networks to reduce these gaps.   Goal 12:  people are spending more money on drugs than before, which means that people are getting older and having more access to medicines, which would be positive, but at the same time, it means unsustainable production for profit, which deserves further investigation. The development of Green Chemistry may be a great help on this goal.   Goal 13:  medicines incineration, if not properly done, may result in more residues and carbon. Developing countries may also invest in more feasible practices, such as inertization, where the medicines without the packs are mixed with other substances such as water and concrete (WHO, 1999 ). Moreover, the recycling of the packages is essential to avoid unnecessary solid residues.   Goals 14 and 15:  pharmaceutical pollution is a threat to other living organisms besides humans since ecotoxicological studies already reported toxicity in environmental concentrations, mainly considering behavior and long-term effects, as well as mixture effects. The rational use of medicines is essential to avoid unnecessary disposal.     3 Conclusion Considering pharmaceutical pollution as a case study to observe the adherence of human attitudes to sustainable development goals (SGDs), it was observed that from this point of view, in many instances we are going against them. Probably the most apparent evidence for this is that pharmaceuticals have been detected everywhere, showing gaps in sanitation and water quality, posing a threat to human and environmental health. Our narrative review showed that all of the studied countries have drug disposal legislation, even if they are in different spheres (municipal, provincial, or state level, or federal). The current state of drug disposal procedures is difficult to ascertain, but pharmaceutical pollution is still being recorded in these countries also. However, there is still a lack of information and controls from the population in some countries on the correct way to dispose of their discarded medicines. As a consequence, we still have in many instances a continuous route of entry of drugs into the environment via landfills or effluents. In addition, even with current legislation, not all countries reported in this article have a program for monitoring these substances in the environment. We also noted that pharmaceutical pollution is a global environmental issue and efforts must be joined to create a global agreement that provides a regulatory basis for dealing with these pollutants in the environment. The global business actors in this field must take into account the measures mentioned, such as (i) legislation that covers the entire production cycle; (ii) campaigns for the correct disposal of medicines, including environmental awareness for conscious consumption; (iii) avoiding polypharmacy; (iv) investment in monitoring research, environmental fate and ecotoxicological effects of these compounds; (v) investment in sanitation and removal technologies; (vi) application of reverse logistics, eco-pharmacovigilance and green chemistry. Thus, we would protect natural resources and preserve human health by reducing the pollution of pharmaceutical products and moving towards the SDGs.
