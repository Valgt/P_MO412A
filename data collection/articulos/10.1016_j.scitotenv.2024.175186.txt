                  The Water-Energy-Food Nexus (WEFN) has gained international attention as an approach for managing water more holistically, building on the progress made by the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach. However, modelling the availability of water, energy, and food and their interconnections is complex, with major barriers that include the availability of both data and modelling platforms capable of assessing the interconnected systems of the WEFN. There have been attempts to model resource availability in each sector generally, but few attempts to consider the WEFN in complex transboundary basins, especially considering Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, a water, energy, and food availability model was developed using a combination of remotely sensed, national government reported, and global datasets. The model explores the complex interactions between the physical availability and production of water, energy, and food for several subbasins representing different states. Results showed the potential impacts of socioeconomic development, population changes and transboundary cooperation on resources. Transboundary cooperation in the case study Ma Basin in Southeast Asia, under existing resources and operations could improve monthly food security and reduce coal power operations using excess hydropower in the basin during the dry season. These findings show that transboundary cooperation improves access to energy and food, whilst potentially reducing demands for water. Furthermore, the research has highlighted ways in which transboundary cooperation can further assist in attaining SDGs 12 and 13 on responsible production and climate action, respectively. The modelling framework is easily transferable and can support similar analysis in other basins, contributing to global attainment of several SDGs.

Editor: Antonella Petrillo The Water-Energy-Food Nexus (WEFN) has gained international attention as an approach for managing water more holistically, building on the progress made by the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach. However, modelling the availability of water, energy, and food and their interconnections is complex, with major barriers that include the availability of both data and modelling platforms capable of assessing the interconnected systems of the WEFN. There have been attempts to model resource availability in each sector generally, but few attempts to consider the WEFN in complex transboundary basins, especially considering Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, a water, energy, and food availability model was developed using a combination of remotely sensed, national government reported, and global datasets. The model explores the complex interactions between the physical availability and production of water, energy, and food for several subbasins representing different states. Results showed the potential impacts of socioeconomic development, population changes and transboundary cooperation on resources. Transboundary cooperation in the case study Ma Basin in Southeast Asia, under existing resources and operations could improve monthly food security and reduce coal power operations using excess hydropower in the basin during the dry season. These findings show that transboundary cooperation improves access to energy and food, whilst potentially reducing demands for water. Furthermore, the research has highlighted ways in which transboundary cooperation can further assist in attaining SDGs 12 and 13 on responsible production and climate action, respectively. The modelling framework is easily transferable and can support similar analysis in other basins, contributing to global attainment of several SDGs.

The WEFN is a holistic approach for water, energy, and food sectors, equally weighting the importance of each sector (Wicaksono et al., 2017 ). Holistic management is critical to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and can provide substantial benefits (Scharlemann et al., 2020 ), with a large number of studies detailing the depth of SDG interconnections (Allen et al., 2019 ; Requejo-Castro et al., 2020 ). The WEFN approach has been documented as important to achieve SDGs 2, 6, and 7 (Pahl-Wostl, 2019 ). However, whilst the WEFN has received extensive attention both in its importance for attaining SDGs, and in water management, few studies have quantified how availabilities of resources interact to achieve SDGs in complex basins. Here, a WEFN model detailing physical quantity interactions between water, energy, and food sectors was developed, for the first time explicitly considering transboundary WEFN availabilities. Water, energy, and food security is a significant inter-connected global issue and WEFN management is imperative to make advances in resource security without cascading problems from one sector to another. Globally, 2 billion people did not have access to safely managed drinking water in 2020 (United Nations, 2021b ), whilst 759 million people lacked access to electricity (United Nations, 2021c ) and 690 million people were hungry in 2019 (United Nations, 2021a ). With water, energy, and food insecurity such a major problem now, and with projected increases in global demand in each of these sectors (U.S. National Intelligence Council, 2012 ), the crisis will likely intensify. The WEFN aims to increase synergies and limit trade-offs between sectors (Albrecht et al., 2018 ), thus reducing the stress of socioeconomic development and climate change on these resources. The SDGs aim to address these problems regarding access to water, energy and food. The SDGs are a group of 17 goals and 169 associated targets which aim to eradicate extreme poverty and strengthen global peace (United Nations, 2015b ). Similar to other countries, Vietnam and Laos have both committed to the implementation of the SDGs, through incorporating the SDGs into their national plans (Government of the Lao PDR, 2018 ; Ministry of Planning and Investment, 2018 ). SDG 2, 6, and 7, are related to food, water, and energy, respectively, and are most relevant to the WEFN. SDG 2 consists of 8 targets, with the intention to “end hunger, ensure food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agricultural development.” ; SDG 6 also consists of 8 targets, to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” ; and SDG 7 consists of 5 targets which seek to “ensure access to sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy for all .” (United Nations, 2015b ). Transboundary water basins contain 60 % of the world's accessible freshwater, and over 40 % of the world's population are situated within these (UN Water, 2018 ). Transboundary water management is imperative for sustainable development globally, however, <60 % of basins had functional arrangements on water management, as of 2018 (UN Water, 2018 ). Thus, there is need to develop transboundary agreements to ensure sustainable use of these resources in the future. Developing these sustainable transboundary agreements with maximum benefits for local basins relies on understanding the local scientific/technical environmental problems and the drivers of these (Uitto and Duda, 2002 ; Sadoff and Grey, 2005 ; Arjoon et al., 2016 ). There are several barriers in modelling the WEFN approach, with some of the most critical being the availability of data and modelling software (Kaddoura and El Khatib, 2017 ; Endo et al., 2020 ). System Dynamics Modelling (SDM) was chosen as an approach for modelling the WEFN in this study, as SDM was developed for systems thinking, and is fundamentally interdisciplinary (Sterman, 2002 ). SDM has been used extensively in WEFN related studies (Sušnik et al., 2021 ; Purwanto et al., 2021 ; Chen and Chen, 2020 ), and in various SDG assessments (Allen et al., 2019 ; Pedercini et al., 2018 ). For example, Sušnik et al. (2021)  used SDM to understand the nexus in Latvia, however, this considered national boundaries and neglected transboundary water impacts. Furthermore, there was no hydrologic routing of flows. Purwanto et al. (2021)  also used SDM for the WEFN at an administrative level, considering water downstream of a reservoir. However, the reporting of the water component of the model lacks clarity on how water flowed through the system, changing irrigation requirements with temperature, or generating electricity in hydropower dams. The model here differs to these other SDM-WEFN attempts, in its novel conceptualisation of a physical availability model framework scaled to the subbasin level for transboundary basins. It considers physical interactions, using sector specific robust methods, accounting for how changes in flows will affect hydropower generation and how precipitation and evapotranspiration will affect irrigation for example. This accounts for flow of water downstream and the demands of subbasin users, in a way which fully considers physical availabilities and constraints of water systems, whilst displaying transparently the interactions between these systems. The physical nature of the water components mean this model can be further used for understanding climate change in a robust way, by understanding the impacts water and temperature changes will have on energy and food systems. There are other studies which have modelled the WEFN in transboundary basins, but none have considered WEFN availabilities in transboundary basins using SDM. For example, Basheer et al. (2018)  conducted a study combining multiple modelling tools, assessing how cooperation could improve the situation in the Blue Nile Basin, but this modelling approach required substantial data requirements and modelling expertise, and further not considering future socioeconomic scenarios. Vinca et al. (2021)  also modelled a WEFN approach to transboundary agreements to assess progress towards SDGs for the first time, however with an economic focus on investment required to mitigate water scarcity. Their approach also required substantial data and sub-discipline specific modelling expertise. More generally, data requirements and sector specific modelling expertise are limiting factors to implementation of these modelling frameworks globally. The SDM approach proposed here can be more easily adapted because it integrates sub-discipline models into one framework. The model developed here is a base model considering physical interactions with relatively low data requirements which can be obtained from globally available data and commonly available government statistics. Thus, this model bridges a crucial gap in the literature. Until now there have no attempts to develop a transboundary availability model to consider how a WEFN approach to transboundary agreements can assess progress towards attaining SDGs 2, 6, and 7 using SDM. The novel model developed here is the first SDM to explicitly consider transboundary water-energy-food physical availability interactions, using quantitative data available and rigorous methods. This modelling framework can be used with data which is commonly available via national government data and global data. Thus, the approach assists in navigating two barriers and gaps in WEFN implementation, specifically data availability and through a modelling framework which natively integrates water, energy, and food (Kaddoura and El Khatib, 2017 ; Endo et al., 2020 ). The model considers the complexity of transboundary basin interactions, thus allowing for consideration of transboundary policies affecting water, energy, and food systems. The model is developed for a case study basin, namely the Ma River Basin. The Ma Basin is situated in the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Democratic Republic of Lao (hereafter Vietnam and Laos, respectively). A transboundary water project is currently planned in this basin to manage water resources under bilateral and multilateral partnership through the support of a Global Environmental Facility (GEF) International Waters project. Like many other transboundary projects in the world, the GEF project suggests a WEFN approach (Global Environment Facility, 2019 ). The Ma River Basin is a good case study for assessing how a WEFN modelling framework for a transboundary basin can provide information to understand water, energy, and food security in a region undergoing substantial development.  2 Case study area The Song/Nam Ma (Vietnamese and Lao, respectively) or Ma River is a transboundary river basin situated in Southeast Asia, East of the Mekong. The Ma flows from Northwest to Southeast, beginning in Vietnam, flowing through Laos, and returning to Vietnam before draining into the Sea (Fig. 1 a ). Thus, Vietnam and Laos are both upstream and downstream of one another. Here, ‘upstream Vietnam’ is referring to the Vietnamese upstream portion of the Ma River; ‘Laos’ is referring to the Ma River Basin in Laos; and ‘downstream Vietnam’ is referring to the Vietnamese downstream portion of the river (Fig. 1 a). Upstream and downstream Vietnam are separated by Laos. The upstream and Laos sub basins are characterised by complex mountainous topography, whereas the downstream is relatively flat with low elevation (Fig. 1 a). Preliminary analysis in the basin identified several key challenges in the basin, including hydropower causing changes to natural river flow, water withdrawal increases relating to socioeconomic growth, population growth, and agricultural expansion (Global Environment Facility, 2019 ). There are at least 17 hydropower dams already operating in the basin, which have all been developed since the 2000's, thus causing large changes to the river system in recent years. Vietnam and Laos have both increased electricity consumption by 847 % and 741 % per capita between 2000 and 2021 (IEA, 2023a ) associated with socioeconomic development, and driving this increase in hydropower and other energy demand, whilst intensifying the challenge of the transition to renewables. Further, population has increased by 25 % and 42 % in Vietnam and Laos respectively between 2001 and 2023, with a further 8 % and 28 % projected increase by 2050 in each respective country (World Bank, 2023a ). Thus, there will be more demands on already stressed food and energy systems caused by socioeconomic development and population growth in the future. The model developed here assesses water, energy, and food security in the Ma Basin, considering hydropower, crop and animal production, and domestic water use, addressing some of these critical issues for this basin. Given the significant socioeconomic development in Vietnam and Laos, coupled with population increases and existing pressures on resources, this study and model are critical to understand how resources interact in this basin. The model further incorporates some of the most critical factors in the basin as outlined by Global Environment Facility (2019) , which considered local stakeholder inputs. This study and model thus provide a critical source of information for a basin undergoing major development, whilst providing a base of information for transboundary water management which is very important to global SDG 6 implementation (UN Water, 2018 ). 2.1 SDG and socioeconomic situation Both Vietnam and Laos have implementation programs for achieving SDGs centred around water, energy, and food. In Vietnam, overall SDG 2 is progressing, but at an insufficient rate to attain the goal by 2030, SDG 6 is on track, and SDG 7 is stagnating, according to Sachs et al. (2023) . In Laos, overall SDG 2 progress has stagnated, SDG 6 is on track, and SDG 7 progress has stagnated (Sachs et al., 2023 ). In both countries challenges remain for achieving SDGs 2, 6 and 7, by 2030 (Sachs et al., 2023 ). The socioeconomic situation in both Vietnam and Laos has been improving steadily, where both countries consistently had GDP growth higher than world average since 1990 (International Monetary Fund, 2021 ). The GDP has grown at similar rates in recent years, however, Vietnam's GDP is substantially higher than Laos, with GDP in Vietnam estimated at 408.8 Billion USD, and Laos estimated at 15.47 Billion USD in 2022 (World Bank, 2023b ). The Human Development Index (HDI), representing education, health, and standard of living of Vietnam is also higher than the HDI in Laos, with values of 0.703 and 0.607, respectively (UNDP, 2020 ).  2.2 Hydrology The Ma Basin is characterised by distinct wet and dry seasons, with over 85 % of precipitation typically occurring over five months, from May to October. Average monthly precipitation in the catchment ranges from approximately 15 mm in December to almost 300 mm in August. There are several large tributaries for the Ma River, including the largest, Nam Xam/Chu River (Fig. 1 a), which flows through Lao PDR and Viet Nam before joining the Ma River close to where the Ma drains to the sea.  2.3 Energy Energy in the basin is mostly driven by hydropower, with many small-scale hydropower dams (<10 MW), and at least 17 medium-large scale hydropower dams (>10 MW) (Fig. 1 b). Only dams which were operational by December 2022 and over 10 MW were considered in model developed here. There are major dam constructions planned in the Nam Xam River in Laos, which will potentially cause large changes to flow and transboundary scenarios, but data are generally unavailable for these, and operations could not be estimated in this study. Major solar and wind development are not mentioned in literature regarding energy plans in Laos (Ministry of Energy and Mines, 2020 ), nor was it found in a review of renewable energy plans in Vietnam in the basin. Biomass is recognised as a potential energy source in the basin (World Bank, 2018a ). There is one coal power plant in downstream Vietnam and one coal power plant in Laos. The largest dam in upstream Vietnam with regards to total capacity (m3 ) is the Song Ma 3, with a capacity of 42.48 million m3 , and the largest dam with regards to energy generation is the Ta Co Dam, with an installed capacity of 30 MW. During the driest month of the year at Xa La station – situated close to the Laos-Vietnam border (Fig. 1 b), the flow is 102.3 million m3 , meaning none of hydropower dams upstream contribute to monthly flow regulation upstream. In Laos, on the Ma River, there are currently no major hydropower dams. However, on the Nam Xam/Chu River, there are hydropower dams under planning or development. This includes the Nam Xam 3, with a dam height of 121.7 m (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2022 ), and an installed capacity of 156 MW, providing up to 626 GWh per year (Voith, 2021 ). This dam was not operational by the cutoff date for modelling of December 2022 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2022 ), and thus was not modelled. In downstream Vietnam, there are several large hydropower dams on the Ma and on the Nam Xam/Song Chu River. The largest dam with regards to water storage is the Cua Dat Reservoir on the Song Chu tributary, with a gross capacity of 1450 million m3  and a useful capacity of 793.7 million m3 . The largest dam on the Ma River is the Trung Son dam, directly downstream of Laos, with a gross capacity of 348.5 million m3 , and a useful capacity of 112 million m3 . Trung Son Dam is also the largest with regards to energy generation capacity in the Ma Basin, with an installed capacity of 260 MW (Supplementary Information – Energy Data).  2.4 Agriculture Agriculture is diverse in the basin. In upstream Vietnam, maize was historically a major crop, although this has been changing in recent years (Tien et al., 2022 ). Downstream, rice dominates crop production (GSO, 2023 ). The percentage of agricultural land under irrigation varies largely between the upstream and downstream portions of the basin. In the upstream of the basin, the agricultural area irrigated is approximately 47 %, the midstream agricultural irrigated area is 32 %, and the downstream agricultural irrigated area is approximately 93 % (Teluguntla et al., 2023b ).   3 Methodology and data 3.1 Model development The model developed assesses the transboundary water, energy, and food systems for the case study Ma Basin. The model was created using stock and flow systems using data obtained from literature, government statistics and global datasets to drive the model. The stock and flow system was disaggregated into three subbasins, the Vietnam upstream Ma, Laos Midstream Ma, and Vietnam downstream Ma (Fig. 2  ), leading to a lumped availability model for each subbasin that detailed water, energy, and food availability/production. It was assumed in the base case (i.e. without a transboundary agreement) that only water moved downstream from Vietnam to Laos and Vietnam subbasins. Energy and food were not transferred between Laos and Vietnam, however, energy and food were assumed shared between upstream and downstream Vietnam. SDM used a lumped (i.e. spatial average) model structure and monthly temporal resolution as this limited data requirements whilst capturing seasonality and spatial distribution necessary for understanding transboundary complexities in dry and wet seasons. Thus, the SDM model balanced capturing the necessary detail with accessibility of data. The globally rigorously tested methodologies for each component of the model were selected considering local and global data availability, and local methods used in other studies. After verifying the model (Section 4.1), the model was used for scenario testing. The 2015 population was used in the base case. Two future scenarios were then modelled, firstly the projected 2030 population with a 20 % increase in energy and food demand with no cooperation between Vietnam and Laos; and secondly a 20 % increase in energy and food demand with transboundary cooperation between Vietnam and Laos. 3.1.1 Water model GR2M conceptual rainfall runoff models (Mouelhi et al., 2006 ) were developed for modelling river flow, so that hydropower dam inflows could be estimated. GR2M was used, as this model has been shown to skilfully represent monthly flows for a variety of catchments around the world (Mouelhi et al., 2006 ). GR2M has relatively low data requirements, and all of the data is available via global data products. It is important to note however that GR2M is a lumped conceptual model, which does not incorporate physical processes, for example the impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) change on hydrological flows. The GR2M models were calibrated for varying time periods depending on data availability (Supplementary Table S2) and then verified for the most recent hydrological period available in the data (2009–2013). Three streamflow gauges, Xa La (upstream), Cam Thuy (downstream Ma) and Cua Dat (Chu/Nam Xam River) (Fig. 1 b) were used for the calibration and validation. It was assumed that the ungauged hydropower dam flows could be represented by GR2M model parameters calibrated to nearest downstream streamflow gauge. Thiessen Polygons were used to estimate catchment average rainfall for each dam. The runoff from areas between dams were added to the outflow of the preceding dam(s). Precipitation and Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) was used as an input into each subbasin SDM for crop water requirements. Streamflow was simulated from 1983 to 2013. The water requirements for the different energy, food and domestic water components were taken from the whole subbasin storage, such that the water moving downstream has the water requirements for domestic water consumption, food, and energy sectors removed from historical flows. These water requirements were not taken from individual dams but were removed from overall subbasin water availability.  3.1.2 Energy model Hydropower, biomass, and coal were modelled as the energy supplies. The current primary energy supplies in the basin are hydropower in upstream and downstream Vietnam, and two coal power plants in Laos and downstream Vietnam (Fig. 2 ). 3.1.2.1 Hydropower model Hydropower energy generation was based on first principle energy equations, using the flows modelled in GR2M, such that impacts of upstream subbasin uses and climate could be considered in changing hydropower energy available. The energy potential of a hydropower dam for any given month was:(1) E hydro , i   = ηρgh Q i   3600     Where Ehydro,i  is the energy potential for the dam in month i  (Watt-hours/month), η is the efficiency of the hydropower dam, assumed to be 0.9 (Killingtveit, 2020 ), ρ is the density of water (kg/m3 ), g is gravity acceleration (m/s2 ), h is head (m), and Qi  is the monthly flow for month i  (m3 /month). For all hydropower dams, energy generation was limited to the maximum energy generation possible according to the reported installed capacity. Monthly river flow passing through the dam over the maximum energy capacity was assumed to flow downstream without producing energy. Where dam capacities were substantially smaller than monthly flows, the water in the model was assumed to flow through the dam, generating energy, without being stored, as the dams do not have capacity to store monthly water. Evaporation was conceptualised to occur first, and environmental flows were assumed to bypass the turbines for dams where energy generation was not at the dam site, which was estimated to be the case for at least six dams according to visual analyses of satellite imagery. For the two hydropower dams capable of storing monthly flows, the regulation rules (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2018 ) were modelled to simulate operations in dry months. A modified reservoir routing continuity equation was used to determine the energy outflow in the dams capable of storing monthly flow in all months, where energy outflows were calculated using the recorded historical capacity at each time step, (Eq. (2) ):(2) En out  = S t  + Q t  − O t  − E t  − S t + 1      Where Enout  is the river outflow producing energy at time t ; St  is the storage at time t ; Qt  is the runoff at time t ; Ot  is the environmental flow at time t ; Et  is the evaporation from the dam at time t ; and St+1  is the historical storage in the next month. Elevation-area-volume relationships were modelled for the three dams where data was available. For the remaining dams, area was assumed to be the average area value (Ministry of Industry and Trade, 2023 ) with data directly collected from dam operating companies, or calculated as according to maximum storage divided by maximum elevation reported by Ministry of Industry and Trade (2023) . Volume, height and area of dam water were constants assumed average value (Ministry of Industry and Trade, 2023 ) where the capacity of dams was small compared to monthly flow.  3.1.2.2 Biomass model Biomass modelling was based on statistics of residue to yield ratios and low heat values for each major crop in Vietnam (World Bank, 2018a ). The method for understanding biomass energy was chosen due to its use in Vietnam and because the required data for method was available (World Bank, 2018a ). The method has also been used to estimate biomass in studies globally as highlighted in Lodge et al. (2023) . The theoretical energy available for biomass from crops was calculated for each crop (World Bank, 2018a ; Jiang et al., 2019 ; Angelis-Dimakis et al., 2011 ):(3) E Biomass , i   = ∑ j = 1  n  CP i , j   × RYR i , j   × LHV i , j      Where, E is the total energy potential of all n  crops in month i  (Wh); CPj  the crop production of crop j in month i  (kg); RYRj  is Sthe residue to yield ratio of crop j in month i,  and LHVj  is the low heat value of crop j in month i (Wh/kg).  3.1.2.3 Coal power model The coal power plants were assumed to be operating when renewable energy did not meet the energy requirements of any subbasin. This was calculated such that the difference between demand and renewable energy supply was met by coal energy. This generation was also limited by the maximum installed monthly energy capacity, thus using the following equation:(4) E Coal , i   = MIN ( E coal , installed , i   , ( E Demand , i   − E Hydro , i   + E biomass , i   )      Where E Coal , i     is the coal energy produced in month i, E Hydro , i     is the hydropower energy produced in month i , and E biomass , i     is the biomass energy produced in the month i . Thus, assuming that when renewable energy was available it would be used.   3.1.3 Crop model To estimate the basin crop areas, the national government provincial crop type areas were clipped and aggregated to subbasin level using Eq. (5) :(5) A irri , cropi   = ∑ A irri  / A total    LGRIP  × A agri  basin  A Agri  prov    WorldCover  × A cropi , GR       Where, A irri , cropi     is the calculated total area of crop i  under irrigation; A irri   is the total area under irrigation in basin and A total   is the total agricultural area according to LGRIP (Teluguntla et al., 2023b ); A agri  inbasin    is the agricultural area of the province in the basin area and A Agri  province    is the total agricultural area in the province based on WorldCover (Zanaga et al., 2022 ); and A cropi , GR     is the provincial government reported crop area of crop i.  This was summed for all subbasin provinces to get subbasin total crop area for crop i . Crop areas were disaggregated into irrigated and rainfed areas to account for differences in productivity, to more accurately represent irrigation and to allow for future scenario assessments, considering the impacts of changing ratios of rainfed and irrigated areas. Crop yield was calculated assuming that irrigated crops were twice as productive as rainfed crops, based on Teluguntla et al. (2023b)  and Thenkabail et al. (2010)  for global crop yields. The crop yield relationship used in the model was developed such that the combined total of rainfed and irrigated crop yield was equal to the total government reported crop yield:(6) A irri  × Y irri  + A rain  × Y rain  = A total  × Y total     (7) where  Y irri  = 2 Y rain      Where, A irri   is the area under irrigation as previously calculated; Y irri   is yield of the irrigated area); A rain   is the rainfed area of the crop; Y rain   is the yield of rainfed crop; A total   is the total crop area in basin; and Y total   is the total reported yield. The irrigation requirement was calculated primarily based on a simplified FAO56 method (Allen et al., 1998 ), using Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0 ) and Crop Coefficients. The FAO method is a relatively simple method for spatially-lumped analysis of crops, and by using ET0  with crop coefficients, the impacts of changes to crop types on water can be determined. Thus, using the irrigated and rainfed distribution of crops in the subbasins allows the changes to irrigation, impacts of changing crop types, and corresponding impacts on water, to all be assessed at an individual crop type level. A combination of crop calendars, crop coefficients, and the local expertise of authors were used to determine crop growing dates and crop coefficients. These data were used to develop crop water requirements monthly, such that:(8) ET c , i , j   = K c , i , j   ET 0 , j      Where ET c,i,j   is the crop evapotranspiration (ETc ) for crop i  in month j; k c,i,j   is the crop coefficient for crop i  in month j;  and ET 0,j   is the reference evapotranspiration in month j. The irrigation requirement (IN) for month j was then calculated as the difference between effective precipitation and ETc  for that month, where effective precipitation is defined as the rainfall which is used by the plants, subtracting runoff and water for deep percolation (Brouwer and Heibloem, 1985 ):(9) IN i , j   = ET c , i , j   − P e , j       Where IN i,j   is the irrigation requirement; ET c,i,j   is the crop evapotranspiration for crop i  in month j;  and P e,j   is the effective precipitation in month j. Effective precipitation is calculated as according to local expertise of the authors:(10) P e , j   = 0.6 ∗ P − 10  when precipitation < 70 mm     P e , j   = 0.8 ∗ P − 24  when precipitation > 70 mm          The irrigation requirement applies to all crops except for rice where the following initial irrigation requirement is added:(11) IN Rice  = SAT + WL + PERC    Where INRice  is the additional irrigation need of rice; SAT  is the water required to saturate the soil in the prior to sowing rice, set to 200 mm (Brouwer and Heibloem, 1985 ); WL  is the water layer established to submerge the crop at the start of the growing season, assumed to be 100 mm (Brouwer and Heibloem, 1985 ); and PERC  is the water percolating throughout the rice growing season. Soil was assumed as heavy clay as the two major soil types are Acrisols and Gleysols (Open Development Mekong, 2019 ), both of which are not highly permeable. Thus, percolation was assumed to be 4 mm/day (Brouwer and Heibloem, 1985 ). Rainfed crop production water requirements were determined using Eq. (8) , however, in rainfed agricultural areas, irrigation water was assumed unavailable. Thus, instead, when rainfall was below ETc  in any given month, the yield of that crop was reduced for that month by P/ETc.  This accounted for months when ET was greater than P, given water stress induced reductions in productivity. Livestock water requirements for Vietnam and Laos were calculated using Vietnamese government data, which sets minimum water required to be pumped to farms according to population of livestock (TCVN, 2012 ), which was then multiplied by the government reported livestock populations in the subbasins.  3.1.4 Demand model Water, energy, and food demands were estimated based on statistics from global datasets, and national government collected data. Population was modelled from 2009 to 2039, with upstream, midstream, and downstream estimates based on population growth statistics in rural and urban areas in both countries (World Bank, 2023a ). Rural growth rates were used for upstream Vietnam and Laos, as both subbasins are predominantly remote communities. The average of urban and rural growth rates was used downstream, due to the presence of small urban centres in this part of the basin (General Statistics Office, 2020 ). These estimates were bias corrected to match the reported population from 2009 to 2020, with the bias corrected population in 2030 used. The future 2030 scenario assumed static population and was tested with a 30-year hydrological simulation to assess impacts of interannual climate variability. Food demand was based on the kcal energy requirements of people in Vietnam and Laos (FAO, 2023 ). The scenarios consider a direct increase in kcal demand. GDP and other economic variables were not included in the overall kcal demand model. This is because the relationship between income and food suggests a move from starchy foods towards a more diverse diet, including fruits, vegetables, and animal based products (Fukase and Martin, 2020 ). Thus, a simple increase in kcal requirement to satisfy demand associated with GDP increase may not be representative of true food demand. A linear regression model was fitted to the GDP/capita and energy demand/capita, which was used in the model for both Laos and Vietnam subbasins to understand potential energy demand in the future under a changing economy and population.  3.1.5 Monitoring progress in water, energy, and food security Monitoring of water, energy, and food was based on resource security. Despite notable progress having been made, water, energy, and food security remain major wicked problems globally (United Nations, 2021b ; United Nations, 2021a ; United Nations, 2021c ). Monitoring resources from a security perspective is vital to satisfy the needs of growing populations that also aspire to improved socioeconomic wellbeing. The indicators used here are based on targets SDG 2.1, to provide “sufficient food all year round” (United Nations, 2021a ); SDG 6.1, achieving equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all (United Nations, 2021b ); and SDG7.1, ensuring access to energy (United Nations, 2021c ). To monitor the security, the ratio of each resource's supply to demand was calculated, limited to a maximum of one, when supply is greater than demand.(12) Resource Security = MIN 1 Resource Supply Resource Demand        In addition to resource security, the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix was considered in the model, calculated as the ratio of renewable: coal energy. Thus the model also assesses SDG 7.2, increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix (United Nations, 2021c ).   3.2 Scenario development After verifying the performance of the model for the base case for the year 2015, two scenarios were modelled, including 2030 population with a 20 % increase in food and energy demand with no cooperation and the 2030 population with a 20 % increase in food and energy demand with transboundary cooperation. The cooperation scenario assumed ‘central management’ of all water, energy, and food in the basin, such that water, energy, and food were managed as ‘one basin’, rather than disaggregating to countries. Thus, supply was the combined energy and food supply for the whole basin, and demand was the combined energy and food demand of the whole basin. The scenarios were tested to investigate the ability of current water, energy, and food systems to meet water, energy, and food security of the subbasins and to achieve SDGs 2.1, 6.1, 7.1, and 7.2 in 2030, the final year of the SDGs' implementation.  3.3 Modelling data Data are one of the key barriers in WEFN implementation (Kaddoura and El Khatib, 2017 ; Endo et al., 2020 ). In situ data, including national government data, were used where available. Where in situ data were not available, the data hierarchies developed in Lodge et al. (2023)  were used for selecting globally available data as proxies. The Supplementary Information contains for full details on the data sources used. For modelling the WEFN in the Ma Basin, much of the data was not available over the same time period requiring some compromises on the choice of time periods to be modelled. The time periods were selected ensuring consistency within sectors, for example, where possible, all crop data was chosen from the same period (e.g., rice, maize, and sweet potato areas and yields in Vietnam and Laos), and all hydrological data was chosen from the same period (e.g., precipitation, evapotranspiration, and streamflow). However, the crop and hydrological data periods did not align. Hydropower dams completed as of December 2022 were modelled, but the base case hydrological data was from 1983 to 2013, meaning many hydropower dams had not been completed in the period represented by base case hydrological data. The base case scenario was thus a hypothetical representation of the basin, designed to understand the implications of climate variability on the WEF. See Supplementary Information for the data periods of all data. 3.3.1 Water data Hydrological data was collected from a variety of sources, including in situ precipitation gauge data, global reanalysis driven Evapotranspiration (ET) products (NOAA PSL, 2018 ), and in situ observed streamflow data. Thiessens Polygons were used to determine the average rainfall over all catchments contributing to dams for modelling runoff.  3.3.2 Energy data Several data sources were necessary to model hydropower. Dam locations were determined using satellite imagery, web-based searches, and literature. Installed energy capacity was determined using a combination of hydropower operating company websites (Table 1  ) and Ministry of Industry and Trade (2023) . Dam water surface areas for ET losses were determined using Ministry of Industry and Trade (2023)  average areas if dams did not contribute to flow regulation, and relationships detailed in multi-reservoir procedures (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2018 ) where dams could contribute to flow regulation. Basin areas contributing to runoff between dams were calculated using SRTM data. Different methods were used to determine dam water column head used to create energy depending on what information was available. For most dams in the basin, where dam capacity did not contribute to monthly flow regulation, data available for average head of the water column was used directly. For Song Ma 3, there were no data available on the operating head of the water column. Instead, the maximum head of the water column from sea level was used Ministry of Industry and Trade (2023) , and adjusted to the head producing energy using SRTM data. This height was validated by comparing the maximum energy generation flows from Ministry of Industry and Trade (2023)  with the height back-calculated from the power equation estimates of the generated energy (Eq. (1) ), based on the maximum flows and installed capacity of the dam. Relationships using area, capacity and head data (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2018 ) were used to continuously calculate head for dams capable of regulating monthly flow. Biomass data was collected from a study of biomass energy potential (World Bank, 2018a ), which estimated low heat values and residue to yield ratios for Vietnam. These values were also assumed for the Laos portion of the Ma Basin. Coal energy generation capacities were collected through online searches, with national government data primarily used to understand installed energy capacities.  3.3.3 Food and land data Several datasets were used in model development for crop and land areas, including remote sensing products and national government data. ESA's WorldCover Product (Zanaga et al., 2022 ), developed for nominal years of 2020–2021 and the Landsat derived Global Rainfed and Irrigated Cropland Product (LGRIPC30) (Teluguntla et al., 2023a ), developed for the nominal year of 2015 were used for land and crop data. The WorldCover product is available with 10 land cover classes (Zanaga et al., 2022 ). However, there is only one cropland class, and thus it is not suitable for understanding different crop types. A combination of cropland and grassland was used to estimate total agricultural area within each province's basin area. Both Laos and Vietnam publish provincial level crop type area, yield and production data, which were used to determine the different crop types planted and quantities associated with these crops (LAOSIS, 2022 ; GSO, 2023 ). Vietnam and Laos also publish provincial level livestock population data, and Vietnam produce livestock yield values, which were used for both Vietnam and Laos. Food resources (kcal) were estimated based on crop production and conversion factors from mass to kcal (FAO, 2001 ). For water requirements of crops, growing season and crop coefficient data was required, to ensure accurate estimation of monthly water requirements. Growing season data was collected from USDA Crop Calendars (USDA FAS, n.d. ) and local experience of the authors. Crop coefficients were also based on in country expertise and FAO56 crop coefficient tables (Allen et al., 1998 ). For water requirements of livestock, Vietnamese Standards for water requirements per population of livestock were used for Vietnam and Laos (TCVN, 2012 ).  3.3.4 Demand data The demand model was driven by global statistics and in-country information. The subbasin population was based on the provincial population from national government data, factored according to the percentage of the area in the basin. The base population was the population in 2015 according to government statistics. An annual increase in population was applied based on World Bank (2023a)  estimates of population to 2050. Historic energy demand was collected from IEA (2023b)  and GDP was obtained from World Bank (2023b) . Food kcal requirements were collected from FAO (2023) .    4 Results The model details the interactions of water, energy, and food availability at the subbasin level, whilst ensuring water flows from upstream to downstream are maintained. This allows the impacts of future scenarios on water, energy, and food security to be estimated, and the ability for subbasins to achieve SDGs 2, 6, and 7, under transboundary cooperation and no cooperation in 2030 to be assessed. 4.1 Baseline model verification Calibration and validation of transdisciplinary models is complex, largely due to the unavailability of data. Due to this complexity, a range of methods and data can be used for development and verification of models, including comparison with other models and expert peer review (Meadows and Randers, 1972 ; Sterman, 2002 ; Elsawah et al., 2017 ). The verification of the availability model relied on national government data, satellite remote sensing data, previous studies using sector specific, well tested models, and in situ data. The demand model did not need verification as the demand estimates were directly modelled from published data sources. 4.1.1 Water model Split sample calibration and validation was used for the GR2M model. The adopted calibration and validation periods are shown in Table S2 and were chosen to maximise the data available for calibration. The GR2M models had reasonable accuracy, with slightly lower skill for the Cua Dat station, potentially due to hydropower development at Hua Na affecting observed flows. The Supplementary Information provides comparisons of GR2M modelled flows and the observations. The energy production driven by runoff was consistent with expected energy production listed estimated by hydropower operating companies and the Ministry of Industry and Trade (Table 1 ), acting as a secondary verification of runoff estimates.  4.1.2 Energy model Average annual energy production was used for verifying the modelled hydropower energy. All modelled hydropower dams produced results within 25 % of the average annual energy production reported (Table 1 ). This verified both runoff estimates based on the GR2M model, and the hydropower model, thus a validating the central link between water and energy production in the basin.  4.1.3 Crop and crop water model The crop model is based on country statistics (GSO, 2023 ; LAOSIS, 2022 ), so static values of growing area and yields were used, based predominantly on data from 2017 to 2019. The crop data thus did not need to be verified in the model, assuming the collection of these data were performed with appropriate rigour. Output requirements of water for crops were compared against global models and FAO data on range of crop water requirements globally. All values were close to or within the FAO ranges and global models, noting that the global datasets will not represent the climate in Southeast Asia (Table 2 ) .   4.2 Scenario impacts on system 4.2.1 2015 base case The 30-year hydrology simulation shows that under existing conditions, water, energy, and food is secure, including during dry and wet years. The annual rice and maize crops sustain year-round food security, where up to 12 times the monthly food requirement is produced during a single month (Fig. 3  ). The existing energy system is shown to be particularly dependent on hydropower wet season flows as shown (Fig. 3 ), with wet month flows in wet years in Vietnam generating up to 40 % over the energy demand for Vietnam. In the 2015 base case, there are clear impacts from seasonal variability in the water supply, where there is an abundance of water available in the wet seasons compared to dry seasons. The model here however does not fully account for extreme wet events (e.g. floods) due to the monthly temporal resolution, which could have other impacts on availability.  4.2.2 2030 scenarios Under a 2030 population with no cooperation and a 20 % increase in food and energy demand, monthly security is reduced. Food is the most affected under the same crop areas and yields, reducing to 0.81 for the Vietnamese portion of the basin which includes 94 % of the basin population (Fig. 4  ). At the annual scale, food remains secure due to the contribution of rice sustaining year-round food supply. Energy security is sustained by intensive coal energy generation, particularly during the dry season, when low ratios of renewable energy in the energy mix occur (Fig. 5  ). Thus, it would be difficult to meet SDG 7.2, in a local context under this scenario. The average share of renewable energy (hydropower) in the energy mix in the 2015 scenario was 59 %. In the 2030 scenario, renewable energy in the mix was reduced to 47.5 %. Renewable energy generation relies on wet season flows (Fig. 5 ) and thus future changes to wet season flows could cause substantial changes in energy mix. However, there are opportunities for the renewable energy share to increase. Increased renewable energy could be achieved by increased biomass, which has large potential capacity under existing conditions as well as the planned new hydropower projects in the basin. Under the cooperation scenario in 2030, average monthly food security improves from 0.82 to 0.84 (Fig. 6  ), under the same crop areas and yields. The greatest benefits from cooperation are seen in the renewable energy mix in Vietnam and Laos during wet seasons, where coal energy use in Laos can in some months be mitigated by surplus hydropower in Vietnam (Fig. 5 ). If energy was shared within the basin boundaries only the coal power plant in downstream Vietnam would be required, and the Laos coal plant could be inactive. This would increase the renewable energy share by up to 1.7 % monthly using existing infrastructure. Thus, transboundary cooperation in SDG 6, can directly benefit SDG 7.2, and further, SDG 2.1 on zero hunger. These results show the importance of cooperation in the context of sustainable development. The implications of these findings are that cooperation can lead to benefits in water, energy, and food security, without technological development, or increasing infrastructure. Thus, in the context of climate mitigation, where reducing greenhouse gas emissions from human activities is necessary (UNDP, 2024 ), transboundary WEFN cooperation can make large contributions. In the context of SDGs, transboundary WEFN cooperation contributes to more than WEF goals, but also to SDG 12 on “Sustainable Consumption and Production”, and SDG 13 on “Climate Action” (United Nations, 2015a ). The model showed that food was secure in the basin with respect to the indicator of the ratio of food available to food demand in kcal/capita. In reality the situation is more complex because measuring food production does not account for nutrition, particularly for vulnerable subpopulations (e.g. children) or economic access to the available food. These indicators are most important in Vietnam and Laos (Government of the Lao PDR, 2018 ; Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2023 ). Further work is required to understand the relationship between national food demands and basin scale production. Additionally, energy was shown to be secure for Vietnam, but recently, power systems have failed to provide the necessary energy in Vietnam, with power cuts occurring due to a lack of energy available during dry seasons (Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, 2023 ). These results are not expected to be shown here due to the system boundaries being limited to the basin, where enough energy is produced for the basin, but in reality some energy may be exported to other locations. Finally, water security was defined based on the ratio of human water use to total water availability, hence it is based solely on human water requirements. However, if all water was used in the system (or the indicator was equal to 1), this would constitute extreme water stress, with ecosystems collapsing.    5 Discussion The model here was developed to understand socioeconomic changes in a complex data-sparse river basin. This model provides insight into the impacts of transboundary cooperation, population change and socioeconomic development on water, energy, and food sectors, and the associated SDGs. Thus, the model framework using a nexus approach and different scenarios, advances our understanding of impacts and mitigation measures necessary in the future to enable sustainable development in complex transboundary basins. Although the model developed was for the Ma River Basin in Southeast Asia, the modelling framework is directly applicable to other basins globally. In the Ma Basin, water security was not a major problem, with the water security index at or near one for most time steps, including during dry seasons in dry years. Water stress is more pronounced in many other regions in the world. For example, North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, are expected to be some of the most water stressed regions globally by 2050 (World Resources Institute, 2023 ), and this modelling framework could easily be transferred to basins in these countries. Thus, this framework can assist in addressing complex transboundary resource security challenges in the context of SDGs 2, 6, and 7, including through connecting environmental and socioeconomic systems, which is required for future mitigation and adaptation (Mishra et al., 2021 ). A 20 % growth in food and energy demand was assumed for the modelling. This is approximately equal to the estimated global business-as-usual change from 2015 to 2050 per population, according to IIASA SSP 2 scenarios (Riahi et al., 2017 ). Thus, the modelling assists in understanding how current resources will be stressed under global 2050 scenarios for the local population in business-as-usual growth for use in the basin. The results indicate that local populations will still have access to adequate water, energy, and food under the existing infrastructure and increases in energy and food demand. This analysis does not account for use of crops outside of the basin. According to the calculated average of three main crops in Vietnam and the basin from 2011 to 2018 using GSO (2023)  data, the crop production in the basin accounts for approximately 3.8 % of Vietnams total crop production, whilst the population in the basin was approximately 3.6 % of the total population in Vietnam. This might be initially interpreted to suggest that only a small amount of food used in the basin may be exported outside of the basin. However, this should also be considered alongside the large amount of food used in economic centres where there is comparatively low crop production. There could be demands for food outside of the basin which are not modelled here. Considerations should also be made to the export of crops outside of the country. According to FAO (2023) , between 2014 and 2019, of the three main crops considered in the basin, including maize, rice, and cassava, an average of 19,219 thousand tonnes were exported from Vietnam of 60,709 thousand tonnes produced (GSO, 2023 ). Thus, approximately 32 % of these crops produced in Vietnam were exported. Therefore, although increased demand under the same area suggests food security can be attained, this could potentially have cascading impacts on global food security, especially considering increasing pressures on global food systems (World Resources Institute, 2018 ). Global food security and the amount of food exported is however not modelled here. Vietnam has been a net energy importer since 2015 (IEA, 2023a ). In 2017, the installed energy generation capacity in Vietnam was 42 GW (World Bank, 2018b ), whilst here, the estimated capacity of the basin 1.5 GW, including hydropower and coal. Thus, the basin has approximately 3.6 % of the country's energy generation capacity which is approximately the same percentage as people in the basin. However, again, this does not account for large economic centres where demand is high, and supply is relatively low. Energy could be secure only considering the basin, when in reality energy is insecure for the country overall. The results show that in the Ma Basin, water, energy, and food are secure under the 2030 scenario even with substantial increases in energy and food demand and no changes in crop areas, yields, or further energy development. However, whilst water, energy, and food security can be met, there are trade-offs in the targets presented here, including an increase in coal power in the energy mix to supplement production. Thus, whilst human demands can be met, progress on SDG 7.2, increasing renewable energy in the global energy mix would be reversed. With the creation of an agreement under a river basin organisation, managing the transboundary WEFN holistically and existing resources, progress on targets can be improved marginally. However, changes in infrastructure will still be necessary to ensure the energy mix does not rely more on fossil fuels in future scenarios. The model demonstrates ability to understand trade-offs in energy and food supply chain, whilst ensuring future demands are met. This can identify priority areas in energy development in the Ma Basin, or in any basin where the modelling framework is applied. The aim here was to assess the ability of the basin to meet energy and food security with existing resources and operations. However, the model could be modified to account for changes in hydropower operations, impacts on flows, impacts from increasing installed biomass, or cascading effects on water requirements from changing energy policies. The model details water requirements for agriculture, accounting for rainfall, ET, and areas assigned to the most important crops in the basin. This ‘sub-model’ allows for easy agricultural scenario testing, showing how much more water would be required under changes in agriculture areas for any major crop, or for changes in total irrigation areas, and identifying cascading impacts on water security, forest areas, and biomass energy potential. Stationarity was assumed in the climate here for the 30-year hydrological period to allow the impacts of interannual variability to be assessed, however, the model is designed such that changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration can be modelled, thus allowing for climate change scenarios. Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration will have substantial impacts on water, energy, and food systems and the nexus. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate scenarios are expected to lead to changes in precipitation seasonality and increasing temperatures in Southeast Asia (Gutiérrez et al., 2021 ). The SSP5–8.5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5–8.5) scenario, which is the most extreme climate scenario from the IPCC where no action is taken on reducing emissions (IPCC, 2021 ), was considered here. The ensemble mean of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate models for this scenario suggests a small reduction in January–February dry season precipitation in the basin. In all other months precipitation increases, leading to an annual average increase of 8 % per month in precipitation in the Ma River Basin. Temperature is projected to increase by an average of 4°. The projected changes were used to scale historical inputs to the hydrological models. Only small changes are projected for annual total river flow to all dams (between 1 and 4 %). However, changes in seasonality are projected to reduce dry season flows and increase September–October wet season flows. Climate scenarios such as the one modelled here, would have negative consequences for the WEFN. Increases in temperature and potential evapotranspiration would increase crop water requirements, impacting crop yields and shifting the timing of crop growth cycles. The modelled changes will exacerbate issues of water security in the dry season, with decreased flows available, whilst potentially increasing risk of floods in the wet season, due to increased river flows in September – October. There could also be cascading impacts onto hydropower, because dry season flow decreases would reduce annual output, as wet season flows generally already produce peak hydropower energy outputs. Thus, it is vital that appropriate data and models are available for WEFN analyses to allow climate change scenarios to be integrated into policy and decision making. 5.1 Limitations 5.1.1 Limitations and assumptions of individual model components In developing a lumped, monthly scale SDM for assessing the WEFN, there were trade-offs in the modelling components' complexity and selection. All methods were chosen to limit data requirements, making the modelling relatively accessible to any location globally, with little modelling expertise required. However, this resulted in trading complexity with potential realism of the physical system dynamics. Limitations of individual components of the model are mentioned in the methodology, however, more detail is provided here on the overarching implications of these limitations on the model use. The hydrological model driving the water component of the SDM was a GR2M model, which has been shown to estimate flows well around the world (Mouelhi et al., 2006 ), and estimated flows with high NSE values here. However, as noted in the methodology, lumped models cannot consider LULC change impacts on flows, or non-stationary catchment processes, as they are trained on historical data (Fatichi et al., 2016 ; Singh, 2018 ). The monthly temporal resolution of the hydrological model also limits the ability of the model to estimate the impacts of extreme events in small dams. Only hydropower, biomass, and coal were considered in the energy component of the model. This was a decision based on published policies of future energy sources in the basin, and therefore solar and wind energy have not been incorporated in the model. Moreover, the energy demand is limited to the basin itself, not considering use of energy outside of the basin, where energy intensity and population density could be higher. Whilst basin scale is suitable for water, the national energy grid in Vietnam makes it unlikely that hydropower and coal produced in the basin will only be used in the basin. Coupled basin-national WEFN studies would be required to provide a more comprehensive understanding. The crop and food components of the model were developed with similar considerations of data requirements. The crop component relies on statistical data reported by government which inherently considers pests and fertilization, limiting data requirements. However, due to this the impacts of future climate, crop technology and other drivers can therefore not be separately quantified. Further, irrigated crops are assumed twice as productive as rainfed crops, as is estimated in global literature, but some crops are more resilient to droughts, for example, cotton can withstand water shortages better than rice paddy (Brouwer and Heibloem, 1985 ). Thus, the assumption does not capture some of the dynamics between certain crops and drought resistance in rainfed agriculture. The assumption does however capture the varying water requirements for different crops and allows for understanding how different crop production will contribute to water insecurity for irrigated areas.  5.1.2 Gaps in model Whilst the model achieved promising results that can be used to understand impacts of future scenarios, there are some assumptions which fundamentally limit the work. Water quality and soil degradation are not considered here, for example. Considering water quality would particularly affect food-water interactions and is important in the region (Sebesvari et al., 2012 ). Changes in food production are assumed to only rely on water and irrigation, whereas, fertilizers and soil would have a large impact (Cuong et al., 2017 ). The model shows that water is not limited in terms of quantity. However, if considering water quality, the ‘water security’ could be changed substantially. Additionally, considering security from the availability perspective at the subbasin level may not be representative for individuals, where various socioeconomic factors affect individuals access to resources. Moreover, whilst food security is determined by calories available compared to calories demanded, this does not account for nutritional value or food waste, which contributes to a series of other system problems (Melikoglu et al., 2013 ). There were several challenges in developing the WEFN model, many of which are caused by problems cited widely in literature (Kaddoura and El Khatib, 2017 ; Endo et al., 2020 ). The key barrier was access to data, which resulted in running scenarios using data from various time spans to force the model. The data barrier was partially navigated using Lodge et al. (2023) , however, both developing and validating the model was difficult without access to comprehensive in situ observations at the correct spatial and temporal resolution. Assumptions were necessary in some cases to overcome data scarcity, for example, assuming that water requirements for livestock were the same in Vietnam and Laos, or assuming that livestock yields would be the same. This meant compromising potential spatial variability in livestock practices and infrastructure, which could have demonstrated impacts of changing livestock populations in Laos.   5.2 Future work Human interactions with the physical system should be included in the modelling framework in future work. The base model developed here could be used in conjunction with a socioeconomic model with feedback loops to assess various socioeconomic scenarios. More comprehensive transboundary cooperation scenarios and the impacts of this on water, energy, and food can be assessed under this framework, for example. Such a model would consider any policies or scenarios for the whole integrated WEFN system, showing how achieving energy and food targets can impact on water security. Through framing the model from an SDG perspective, whilst testing impacts on availabilities of resources, the sustainability of these decisions can be assessed. The energy and food produced considered in the basin are assumed constant under the scenario tested here. New energy infrastructure would affect the energy mix results here, for example, hydropower energy is likely to change in the future, as several dams planned are not modelled. Biomass could additionally be an energy source in the basin to investigate further, as detailed in World Bank (2018a) , however the data and stakeholder participation to determine this could not be achieved within the scope of this research. Furthermore, changes in food, in terms of increasing irrigated area, changing diets, increasing yields, or changes in irrigation water use efficiency are major changes which can be modelled under the modelling framework here. Social impacts on the system are important, especially in the context of socioeconomic changes, and stakeholders should be consulted under any future work considering this. Southeast Asia is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts (IPCC, 2023 ), and these impacts are critical to understand for transboundary water and the WEFN. Precipitation intensity will intensify and become more frequent, and temperature will likely increase (IPCC, 2023 ). The changes in precipitation are highly uncertain between climate models, whilst different representative concentration pathways, representing climate change scenarios change the temporal distribution, direction, and scale of changes (Gutiérrez et al., 2021 ). Thus, whilst climate scenarios are of great importance in the region, a comprehensive analysis of these was considered outside the scope of this study. Climate analyses are critical in studies of future water, energy, and food systems in the region.   6 Conclusion A model was developed for assessing the impacts of socioeconomic growth and transboundary cooperation on transboundary river basins, focussing on the case study Ma Basin in Southeast Asia. The model shows how population growth, socioeconomic development and transboundary cooperation affect water, energy, and food security until 2030. This model framework can be used for other basins globally, with good compatibility for using global and widely available government reported data. The results show that water, energy, and food availability will be secure until 2030, under existing infrastructure, however, SDG 7.2 relating to renewable energy in the energy mix will not be met under this infrastructure. Transboundary cooperation, in managing the river basin as one entity, improved attainment of all SDG targets considered with no changes to development, showing the importance of transboundary cooperation in a future sustainable world.
