                  Forests are considered as a sacred asset in India and have guided the way of living throughout its history. Indian forests not only accommodate the myriad species but also act as a survival support system to the communities that depended on them. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development proposed by the United Nations (UN) has gained momentum and becomes an integral part of the recent efforts of Indian governance. In this investigation, we examined the potential nexus between Indian forestry system (biodiversity-enriched assets, ecosystem services, constitutional mechanisms, and governances) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through theoretical underpinnings from literature that selected from database like Google Scholar, Indian forest survey reports, and information retrieved from Indian government websites. The significance of this review is that it presents comprehensive information about Indian forestry, biodiversity-rich assets, and sustainable forest management practices. The results show that Indian forestry as a whole is an integral part of the food-energy-water cycle and contributes to all dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. The investigation confirms that besides partly contributing to the economy and life support systems to many dependent species, forests also act as boosters in the areas of food security and health. Targets related to the climate action, peace, and partnership goals are well in place through various forestry interventions and environmental commitments by the Government of India.

Forests are considered as a sacred asset in India and have guided the way of living throughout its history. Indian forests not only accommodate the myriad species but also act as a survival support system to the communities that depended on them. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development proposed by the United Nations (UN) has gained momentum and becomes an integral part of the recent efforts of Indian governance. In this investigation, we examined the potential nexus between Indian forestry system (biodiversity-enriched assets, ecosystem services, constitutional mechanisms, and governances) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through theoretical underpinnings from literature that selected from database like Google Scholar, Indian forest survey reports, and information retrieved from Indian government websites. The significance of this review is that it presents comprehensive information about Indian forestry, biodiversity-rich assets, and sustainable forest management practices. The results show that Indian forestry as a whole is an integral part of the food-energy-water cycle and contributes to all dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. The investigation confirms that besides partly contributing to the economy and life support systems to many dependent species, forests also act as boosters in the areas of food security and health. Targets related to the climate action, peace, and partnership goals are well in place through various forestry interventions and environmental commitments by the Government of India.   Keywords Indian forests  Sustainable Development Goals (SDSGs)  Sustainable forest management  Economic sustainability  Social sustainability  Environmental sustainability  Climate change    1 Introduction The concepts of protection and propagation of forests are deeply rooted in various practices of Indian civilization, because many of its cultural principles regard forests as a sacred natural asset and rely on the motive of ‘save the tree, it saves you’ (Kumar, 2008 ; Anthwal et al., 2010 ). The methods of conservation and sustainable management of forests were ingrained at every stage of protecting the natural resources right from the times of pre-historic India, and forests with their associated natural resources have guided the way of living in India from the beginning of civilization (Bhattacharya, 2014 ). In 2015, the member countries of United Nations (UN) adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which now has gained momentum and becomes an integral part of the policies by governments, institutions, businesses, and societies. This agenda is a plan of action for people, the planet, and its prosperity, designed to strengthen the universal peace (United Nations-Sustainable Development, 2015 ). The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets under this agenda are integrated, indivisible and attempt to balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability (United Nations-Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015 ). The targets under SDG 6-‘Clean water and sanitation’, SDG 13-‘Climate action’, SDG 14-‘Life below water’, and SDG 15-‘Life on land’ are responsible for achieving sustainability of the biosphere that hosts forests and associated ecosystems (Rockström and Sukhdev, 2016 ). Forests play a significant role in the water-cycle, providing livelihoods and mitigating climate change; they are an essential component of sustainable food production (Food and Agriculture Organization-United Nations Environment Programme, 2020 ). A primary support for the forestry sector has been emphasized in SDG 15 with the theme ‘Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss’. Especially, one of SDG 15 targets is dedicated to forests, saying: ‘By (2030), promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests, and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally’. De Jong et al. (2018)  and Baumgartner (2019)  have investigated the relationship between the targets of SDGs and the forestry sector; their studies concluded that several SDGs have a strong relevance with the aspects of forests. Recently, Krause and Tilker (2021)  focused on defaunation in the tropics and its impacts on achieving SDGs, and argued that tropical forests are of utmost importance for achieving all SDGs and that preventing defaunation is crucial for maintaining ecological functions and evolutionary relationships. The purpose of this study is to review and examine how comprehensively the Indian forest ecosystem, its associated services and forest policies contribute to achieving the SDGs through a literature survey. Even though the forestry sector is closely associated with SDG 15, we investigate the fostering elements of the Indian forestry sector whether they support the remaining 16 SDGs within the framework of sustainability dimensions.  2 Brief background about the state of Indian forests As per the India State of Forest Report (Forest Survey of India (FSI), 2019 ), the total forest cover of the country is 7.12 ​× ​105  ​km2  and accounts for 21.67% of the country’s geographical area. Due to this remarkable feature, India takes a slot in the list of ten most forest-rich countries of the world (Food and Agriculture Organization-United Nations Environment Programme, 2020 ). Even though the predominant forest types in India are tropical dry deciduous and tropical moist deciduous, other forest types are also found based on different zones of rainfall and topography (Reddy et al., 2015 ). With only 2.40% of the world’s land area, India has 7.00%–8.00% of recorded species, including 4.50 ​× ​104  plant species and 9.10 ​× ​104  animal species (Thakur et al., 2018 ). India, a mega-diverse country and amazingly rich in biodiversity, harbors four of 36 global terrestrial biodiversity hotspots (Clearing-House Mechanism of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2018 ). Currently, Indian forests include 104 national parks, 551 wildlife sanctuaries, 88 conservation reserves, and 127 community reserves that satisfy the norms under various categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) under the Central Government is responsible for planning, promoting, coordinating, and overseeing the implementation of India’s forestry related policies and programs (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, 2021 ).  3 Methodology The FSI, an organization under the MoEFCC, publishes a biennial report: the India State of Forest Report; the India State of Forest Reports pertaining to the years during 1999–2019 were considered in this investigation to derive the statistics of Indian forest and associated sub-systems. The United Nations Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform (2016)  has been referred to understand the intricate details of various targets related to the SDGs. A systematic literature review on a particular topic enables the researchers to synthesize the results of published research for an evidence-based practice (Xiao and Watson, 2019 ). In recent years, the systematic literature review approach has gained popularity and is considered to be more rigorous, structured, and robust, especially in the emerging areas of environmental and climate science (Williams et al., 2018 ; Akinyi et al., 2021 ). In this study, systematic literature review was employed to evaluate the state of Indian forests in the framework of sustainable development; towards this, the features of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis proposed by Moher et al. (2009)  were adopted and the method is depicted in Fig. 1  . A total of 78 peer-reviewed publications published in and after 2010 were used to evaluate the ecosystem services offered by Indian forests and to understand the relationship of Indian forests with various targets of SDGs. Specifically, Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/ ) was utilized in this review with relevant keywords pertaining to forests and SDGs were given as search keys there. The reviewed literature also includes summaries and results from various surveys and interviews by other scholars, as their results are correlated with the targets of SDGs. Prevailing laws under the Constitutions, policies, schemes, and rules that govern the Indian forest system were retrieved from the official websites of Government of India such as Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (https://moef.gov.in ), Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (https://agricoop.nic.in ), Press Information Bureau, Government of India (https://pib.gov.in ), and National Portal of India (https://www.india.gov.in ). Examples of best practices from various forest-related projects originated recently in India that are available from the websites of National Mission for Clean Ganga (https://www.nmcg.nic.in ), National Health Mission (https://nhm.gov.in ), Smart Cities (https://smartcities.gov.in ), and National Water Development Agency (http://nwda.gov.in ) were used to check their alignment with SDGs. Works done by Hazarika and Jandl (2019)  and Katila et al. (2019)  have established the core connection between the global forestry sector and SDGs; their results were utilized in identifying the core targets of SDGs that are relevant to the forestry sector and were used in this investigation to make the necessary defense.  4 Results and discussion The following results are the findings after synthesizing the literature review done for Indian forest ecosystem, its associated services and the forest policies abided by the Government of India towards achieving the targets of SDGs. 4.1 SDG 1: No poverty Evidence shows that forests and its associated services can play a pivotal role in poverty alleviation, supporting rural livelihoods, acting as safety nets, and providing a natural insurance (Cheng et al., 2017 ; Miller et al., 2020 ). Forestry is the second largest land use type in India after agricultural land and an estimated 2.75 ​× ​108  people in the rural areas depend on forests at least partially for their livelihoods (Mundial, 2006 ). The contribution of agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector to India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) occupies more than 17.00% during the last three financial years: 2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018 (Press Information Bureau, 2018 ). As reported in 2011, the total number of forest fringe villages is about 1.70 ​× ​105 , which are located in the proximity of forest areas (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ). Barik and Mishra (2008)  assessed the contribution of forests located in the northeastern states to Indian economy and concluded that the economic and environmental benefits of this extensive biodiversity-rich forest area are immense and that people’s livelihood depends heavily on it. Damania et al. (2020)  investigated the relationship between forests and poverty in India by using household survey data in two Indian states, namely Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh; their analysis confirmed that the poorest receive about 30.00% of their income from forests and this amount is higher than the income that they earn from agriculture. The results obtained from Barik and Mishra (2008)  and Damania et al. (2020)  revealed that Indian forestry sector contributes to the targets 1.1 and 1.2 under SDG 1. In addition, their findings endorsed that the forest resources contribute to people’s livelihood mainly as a safety net during lean times (conformal to the targets 1.3 and 1.5 under SDG 1). Forests are recognized as an integral part of national economies as they provide a wide range of capital stocks like timber, which is a typical source of capital for forested nations (Food and Agriculture Organization, 1995 ). Growing stock is one of the basic statistics of any forest inventory and is an indicator of the balance between the net annual increment and annual felling of trees for wood supply (Wolfslehner et al., 2016 ). The total growing stock of trees latest by 2019 in India is estimated to 5.91 ​× ​109  ​m3  (including inside forest areas and outside recorded forest areas), and there is a total increase of 9.30 ​× ​107  ​m3  (1.60%) in the growing stock of the country as compared to the estimates reported for 2016–2017 (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ). Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) refer to products and services other than timber that is produced by forests. NTFPs are useful commodities obtained from forests without harvesting (logging) of trees (Bettinger et al., 2016 ). NTFPs include wild plants, fungi, wild fruits, nuts, edible roots, small mammals, insects, fish, honey, palms, and medicinal plants (Pullanikkatil and Shackleton, 2019 ). NTFPs are an integral part of Indian National Forest Inventory and an important source of livelihood for many tribal communities and villagers living in the proximity of forests. As a source of food, medicine, handicraft material, and income for many, NTFPs do certainly play a role in alleviating poverty in countries like India. The spice trade from India to European countries is commercially successful and the demand continues (Shackleton and Pullanikkatil, 2019 ). The India State of Forest Report (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ) has published state-wise details of NTFPs, which indicate a significant contribution of various NTFPs to the national GDP. Large revenues flowing to the nation’s exchequer from NTFPs have increased the country’s vested interest in marketing the products, benefiting both the poor who rely on gathering them for their income, and the potential users of NTFPs (Kumar et al., 2000 ). Mangrove is a salt-tolerant evergreen forest ecosystem, which is mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical coastal and/or inter-tidal regions; the ecosystem services provided by mangrove have many advantages (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2010 ). Mitra (2020)  mentioned that from the perspective of environmentalists, mangrove acts as a captivator of greenhouse gases and also as a natural guard against natural disasters. Similarly, from an economic point of view, mangrove provides various commodities like timber, fuel wood, fodder, fishes, honey, wax, etc., and acts as an economic driver for coastal prosperity. The India State of Forest Report (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ) assessment shows that the current mangrove cover in India is 4975.00 ​km2 , which is 0.15% of the country’s total geographical area. The India’s Joint Forest Management (JFM) strategy is a decentralized program that is often hailed as a successful strategy in arresting forest degradation and promoting socio-economic development of forest fringe villages (Khare et al., 2000 ). Bhattacharya et al. (2010)  previously analyzed the design and implementation components of the JFM based on its two decades of experience and evaluated its impacts on forest protection and forest productivity as well as on the livelihoods of local communities. The JFM strategy is built on the notion that local communities will cooperate with forest departments in forest protection and regeneration and other allied activities in exchange for a share of the final harvest and so-called “usufruct” rights, i.e., the right to utilize the forests so as long as they are not damaged or altered (Kumar et al., 2000 ; Sreedharan and Matta, 2010 ). The Forest Policy of India 1988) paved the way for implementation of the JFM throughout the country, which has been encouraged by the central government (Kumar et al., 2000 ). An analysis done by Singh et al. (2011)  confirmed that the village-level JFM committees that have local rule-making, local monitoring, and local enforcement are more likely to succeed in improving forests and livelihoods. Chhattisgarh contains approximately 7887 JFM committees (covering an area of 3.31 ​× ​104  ​km2 ) and involves 1.12 ​× ​106  families, whereas Madhya Pradesh has a strong network of 15,228 JFM committees, covering an area of 6.68 ​× ​104  ​km2  (Forest Research Institute, 2015 ). This clearly shows that the concept of the India’s JFM strategy is focused well in the direction of the targets 1.4 and 1.a under SDG 1, as they emphasize the issues like access to natural resources and enhancing development cooperation. Singh (2005)  in his work related to the Indian version of the JFM strategy mentioned that, the JFM strategy has not only rejuvenated the forest cover but also brought socio-economic changes in the life of the communities living in the villages on the periphery of forests in the country. Nautiyal et al. (2020)  appreciated the commercial value of medicinal plants in various forest reserves of India. Bamboo, also called green gold, is becoming increasingly more valuable in the global economy. As a faster growing plant, it is a widely used economic resource, especially for the tribal population, which can alleviate poverty (Thakur, 2020 ). Over the last few years, the bamboo policy in India has undergone major changes as the National Bamboo Development Program has been restructured with a shift in priority from restoring bamboo forests to promoting farm bamboo and developing its market linkages (Tambe et al., 2020 ; Thakur, 2020 ). In India, there are about 125 indigenous and 11 exotic species of bamboo from 23 genera, and bamboo grows naturally almost throughout the country (except Kashmir). This species grows abundantly in the deciduous and semi-evergreen forests of the northeastern India and tropical moist deciduous forests of northern and southern India. It is estimated that the total area of bamboo in the country is 1.60 ​× ​105  ​km2  (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ). Lal and Singh (2003)  mentioned that the economic value of carbon is stored in various forms of Indian forest biomass. The India State of Forest Report (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ) has estimated that the total carbon stock of Indian forest for 2019 is 7.12 ​× ​109  ​t, in which soil organic carbon is the largest pool of forest carbon, accounting for 56.19% of the total carbon pool, followed by above-ground biomass (31.67%), below-ground biomass (9.84%), litter consisting (1.80%), and dead wood (0.50%). This huge carbon stock resource clearly shows the economic and ecological value that Indian forests can provide. Gorain and Malakar (2020)  have suggested various methods for formulating the valuation of forestry sector and proposed quantifying methods, such as the total economic value method, carbon sink method, and green accounting method. All forest-based tangible economic assets described above, together with the economic aspects including medicinal plants, aromatic plants, and flowering plants, as well as other intangible benefits (e.g., ecotourism) will surely account for a significant valuation in all forms of these quantifying methods. This clearly shows that Indian forestry sector can foster all poverty targets under SDG 1.  4.2 SDG 2: Zero hunger Sunderland et al. (2013)  mentioned the role of forests in combating the issues related to food security and nutrition. Asprilla-Perea and Díaz-Puente (2019)  expressed the importance of wild foods in regular food security in tropical forest areas. Dlamini (2020)  elaborated how forest ecosystem services can contribute towards helping food security in the context of SDG 2. Bose (2020)  surveyed four particularly vulnerable tribal groups located in the remotest places of forests in central, east, west, and south of India using a detailed qualitative interview; the results of this survey clearly showed that particularly vulnerable tribal groups are dependent on sustainably collected food from the forests, including wild rice, millets, honey, fruits, bamboo shoots, small wild animals, insects, etc. This type of evidence supports the Target 2.1 of SDG 2. The work conducted by Bose (2020) , Kumar and Saikia (2020) , and Neelakantan et al. (2020)  appreciated the abundance of NTFP resources in Indian forests for tackling food security issues of the indigenous people. Nautiyal et al. (2020)  have presented an analytical model for medicinal plant cultivation to improve food security in India. Patel et al. (2020)  has mentioned the role of agroforestry-based agriculture practice in India towards supplementing food security issues, which clearly fosters the Target 2.3 under SDG 2. Agroforestry can contribute to food security, increase biodiversity, and combat climate change, and sustainable agroforestry methods have the strongest impact potential on nine of the 17 SDGs (Andersson, 2018 ). India is the first nation in the world to adopt a dedicated policy on agroforestry (World Agroforestry, 2021 ). The policy titled “The National Agroforestry Policy of India” is a comprehensive policy framework designed to improve agricultural livelihood, protect environment, provide environmental security, increase forest cover, and seek to overcome many of the obstacles to the adoption of agroforestry in the country, including adverse policies, weak markets, and a dearth of institutional finance (Government of India, Department of Agriculture & Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, 2014 ). The diversity of genetic resources for food and agriculture plays a crucial role in meeting the basic human food and nutritional needs (Dar et al., 2020 ). A review conducted by Koskela et al. (2014)  showed that the Indian forests have significantly contributed a wide variety of genetic resources to other countries. The Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education is a leading organization in India for forestry research and has formulated strategies for improving the genetic forest resources in India (Koskela et al., 2014 ). Dar et al. (2020)  have elaborated the initiatives and programs for conservation of genetic resources in India, which partly strengthens the Target 2.5 under SDG 2. Indian forests are the richest source of genetic diversity, providing the gene pool for many species with food value (Sharma, 2001 ; Food and Agriculture Organization, 2003 ; Forest Research Institute, 2019 ). These edible forest products are derived from almost all the parts of the tree, such as fruits, stems, tubers, leaves, seeds, flowers, roots, and rhizomes. Recent studies done by Gajurel and Doni (2020) , Mallick et al. (2020) , Sharma et al. (2020) , and Ghosh-Jerath et al. (2021)  collected the records of forest-based food products through field studies in various parts of Indian forests.  4.3 SDG 3: Good health and well-being Forests play a significant role in both providing health benefits and mitigating negative health impacts (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, 2020 ). The recreational benefits of forests provide physical and mental health through stress alleviation. McFarlane et al. (2019)  analyzed the co-benefits between SDG 3 and forest ecosystems. Certain NTFPs provide medicinal products and essential nutrients that are needed for good maternal and child health, as well as ingredients of modern and traditional medicines. Medicinal plants sector in India has traditionally occupied an important position in the sociocultural, spiritual, and health domains (Holley and Cherla, 1998 ). About 9000 species of medicinal plants are used by the traditional systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy, and about 90.00% of the country’s medicinal plants are found in the wild (Biswas et al., 2017 ). The Himalayan region and northeastern parts of India are widely known for their rich medicinal and aromatic plant biodiversity, consisting of 2500 medicinal species (Nautiyal et al., 2020 ). The National Medicinal Plants Board under the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) is implementing Central Sector Scheme on conversation, development, and sustainable management of medicinal plants. Nautiyal et al. (2020)  provided the details of medicinal plant biodiversity in India along with their economic viability and related government sponsored schemes for promoting the medicinal plants sector. Santhan (2020)  conducted field studies in major parts of the country and reported numerous medicinal plants that have antioxidant, laxative, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-amoebic, and anti-cancer properties. The Forest Rights Act 2005 of India seeks to recognize the rights of communities living in and near forests for collecting medicinal plants. Various schemes and capacity-building programs are offered to the local communities to train them on sustainable collection and processing of quality medicinal products which are made available to the medical industry. The end result ensures a livelihood opportunity for the local and indigenous people. Over 1.04 ​× ​108  tribal people from 705 tribes account for 8.60% of India’s population according to the 2011 census (National Health Mission, 2016 ). An expert committee constituted by the Government of India on tribal health issues has reviewed the status of tribal health and health-care in India. The primary issues they face include child mortality, disease burden, malnutrition, mental health, addictions, and health-care infrastructure. The recommendation of this committee includes overarching sub-goals to create a functioning, sustainable, and universal system of health-care for tribal people (National Health Mission, 2018 ). These sub-goals aim to meet the targets 3.1 to 3.5 under SDG 3. To strengthen the primary healthcare for the tribal hotspots, the Government of India has trained local tribal youth volunteers (called Arogya Mitra), equipped the traditional resource persons, and engaged the trained female community health activists (designated as Accredited Social Health Activists) for an effective and doorstep delivery of primary health. The Government of India under its ambitions National Health Mission provides financial and technical support for strengthening the public healthcare system, including development of health infrastructure in tribal areas (National Health Mission, 2018 ; Parliament of India - Lok Sabha, 2019 ). The Ministry of Tribal Affairs through its Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-scheme provides funds to the state governments as an additive towards the development of various sectors, including the health sector. The Mobile Medical Unit under the National Health Mission is a key strategy to facilitate access to public healthcare, particularly to the people living in remote, difficult, under-served, and unreachable areas. The objective of this strategy is to achieve universal access to equitable, affordable, and quality health care services that are accountable and responsive to people’s needs (National Health Mission, 2016 ). Schemes like this can help in achieving the targets 3.7, 3.8, 3.b, 3.c, and 3.d under SDG 3.  4.4 SDG 4: Quality education Pro-environmental behavior will consciously seek to minimize the negative impact of one’s actions on the natural and the built world (Kollmuss and Agyeman, 2002 ). The elements of positive environmental factors related to forests is a part of pro-environmental behavior and also a basis for building a positive relationship between SDG 4 and forests (Kanowski et al., 2019 ). Evidence-based education is a must, similar to evidence-based forest management; research is needed about the future forest-economic-sustainability, curricula objectives and content, educational material, and pedagogical methods (United Nations Forum on Forests, 2019 ). Educational institutes that offer forest schooling are pathways to connect with the nature and for pro-environmental behavior (Cudworth and Lumber, 2021 ). Regarding education in forestry, India has a good pool of dedicated universities/institutes in agriculture and horticulture that have kept forests as a mainstream subject in their core curriculum (Dhaka and Choudhari, 2018 ). Forestry and associated institutions play an important role in efficient management of forest and wildlife resources for capacity building and research activities. Table 1   presents the national-level academic institutes dedicated to the forestry sector in India. National Portal of India Tribal Affairs (2020)  contains various schemes that are designed for the upliftment of educational facilities for tribal students. These schemes and programs cater primary and secondary education along with scholarships (fulfillment of the targets 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.b under SDG 4). Fellowships like Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship for scheduled tribe students can help students with disabilities and in vulnerable situations in getting quality education (positive for the Target 4.5). A scheme titled ‘Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram’ is an initiative that targets livelihood generation for the tribal population through harnessing the forest wealth. This sort of schemes aims to use the traditional knowledge and skill sets of the tribal people by adding technology services for the upgradation of output at each stage, and to convert the tribal wisdom into a remunerative economic activity (Press Information Bureau Government of India Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 2019 ). Such schemes meet the objectives of the targets like 4.3 and 4.4 under SDG 4. The Tribal Co-operative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is involved actively in capacity building of the tribal people through sensitization and creating Self Help Groups. The TRIFED is engaged in training tribal groups in several activities, so that they can contribute effectively as entrepreneurs. The TRIFED plays the dual role of a market developer and a service provider, empowering them with knowledge and tools to improve their operations in a systematic and scientific manner, and also assisting them in developing their marketing approach (TRIFED Tribal Co-operative Marketing Development Federation of India, 2020 ). Such programs will improve the socio-economic development of the tribal people in the country by marketing the development of tribal products, on which the lives of tribal groups depend heavily as they spend most of their time and derive a major portion of their income.  4.5 SDG 5: Gender equality SDG 5’s ambition to ‘achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’ is extremely important in the forestry context as it brings attention to aspects that make forest livelihoods possible (Arora-Jonsson et al., 2019 ). In the Indian context, as women constitute the most important user group for collecting forest produce to meet the subsistence needs of their families, sustainable forest management is impossible without their active involvement (Godbole, 2002 ; Jattan, 2003 ). Case studies related to the Indian tribal sector show that the greater presence of women on the decision-making bodies, the better the effectiveness of forest conservation and regeneration outcomes (Larson et al., 2016 ). Rout (2018) , Minakshi (2019) , Elias et al. (2020) , Malyadri (2020) , and Sengupta (2021)  have analyzed the recent trend of gender-forest issues that prevail in India; mostly, their positive observations include the existing schemes that encourage women’s participation in various decision-making programs, although the ground reality is the need of awareness programs to highlight and recognize the importance of their involvement.  4.6 SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation Amezaga et al. (2019)  analyzed the forest-water interaction mechanisms. They argued that there are intrinsic links between forests and water. Trees, as living organisms, need water to exist and thrive; as critical landscape components, they strongly influence water availability at local and continental scales. In India, an important aspect of the forest-water nexus is the ‘riparian buffers’, which support rivers and streams in many ways as vital ecosystem buffers (Panda, 2018 ). Krishnaswamy (2017)  has investigated the trade-offs and synergies of Indian forest management and its association with water resources and concluded that India needs a culture of collaboration among hydrologists and establish hydrologic observation units that cater to a range of disciplines and techniques and reach out to communities whose water resources are under threat. Singh (2018)  mentioned that most of the Indian rivers originate or traverse through forest regions in the Western Ghats, central Indian forests, and Himalayan region, and there is an intrinsic link between forests and rivers. Either way, at catchment, landscape, and sub-continental scales, the forest-river interactions benefit each other and these synchronized ecosystem processes yield manifold advantages to flora, fauna, and humans (Calder et al., 2008 ; Panda, 2018 ). The Ganga River, which forms one of the largest basins in the world and drains 26.00% of India’s landmass, is home to many ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, swamps, and mangroves. The Namami Gange Program (Clean Ganga Mission) is an integrated mission and a flagship project by the Government of India, which has achieved success in reaching its dual objectives of effective pollution reduction, and conservation and rehabilitation of Ganga (National Mission for Clean Ganga, 2016 ; Namami-Gange, 2018 ). Namami Gange Program includes forestry-related interventions as the diversity and complexity of forest ecosystems are interconnected with highly dynamic river ecosystems. Experiencing the success of Namami Gange Program, similar forestry interventions are now included in the rejuvenation of 13 major rivers in India (National Water Development Agency, 2016 ). This sort of interventions surely accelerates the achievement of the Target 6.5 under SDG 6. India State of Forest Report (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ) has reported that there are 6.25 ​× ​104  ​km2  wetlands in India, covering 3.83% of the area within the recorded forest area of India. Wetlands in forest areas are of importance for ecosystem services as they add both faunal and floral richness to the biodiversity in forest areas. MoEFCC has notified Wetlands Conservation and Management Rules-2017 under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, which acts as a regulatory framework for the conservation and management of wetlands in India irrespective of their location, size, ownership, biodiversity, or ecosystem service values (Wetlands Conservation and Management, 2017 ). These wetland rules clearly foster the Target 6.6 under SDG 6, which aims to protect and restore water-related ecosystems that are part of forests.  4.7 SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy Forestry and its associated products play a range of roles in the energy service provision and sustainable energy transitions, depending on a variety of contextual factors, such as forest-based energy (Jagger et al., 2019 ). The Government of India initiated an active social welfare scheme titled the “Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana”, which envisages smoke-free rural India to benefit families living ‘below the poverty line’, especially the women, by providing concessional liquefied petroleum gas connections through the entire nation (Ujjwala-Yojana, 2016 ). This scheme encourages increasing usage of liquefied petroleum gas and helps to reduce fuel wood removal from forests (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ). This scheme will contribute to reach the Target 7.1 under SDG 7, which ensures universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. Pali et al. (2020)  in their report mentioned the abundant availability of Sal (Shorea robusta ) in approximately 1.00 ​× ​105  ​km2 , which could produce 1.80 ​× ​105  ​t non-edible seeds annually that can propel the biodiesel mission of India due to its low acid value. Eco-friendly energy from highly abundant biological residue of pine trees has been proposed by Bisht and Thakur (2020) , Malik et al. (2020) , and Sengar et al. (2020)  for Indian conditions. Pilot projects are already underway to utilize the pine needles-based biomass gasifiers by the state government like Uttarakhand (Uttarakhand Renewable Energy Development Agency, 2019 ). These efforts take part in achieving the targets 7.2 and 7.3 under SDG 7.  4.8 SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth The forestry sector is one of the natural resources-based sectors contributing to the national economies and accounts for the contributions to GDP. It is also a relevant source of employment (Stoian et al., 2019 ). In India, forests play a vital role in the rural economy and provide different kinds of benefits, such as jobs and income, which are often needed to supplement the inadequate returns from agricultural production (Malik and Dhanda, 2003 ; Mishra et al., 2021 ). Ghosh (2020)  mentioned the potential of Indian ecosystem services that can contribute to an indicator titled ‘GDP of the poor’. The Food and Agriculture Organization (2020)  mentioned that in 2019, 12.50 ​× ​106  people globally were employed in the forestry sector; out of this, India accounted for 6.23 ​× ​106  people, nearly 50.00%. As of now, India is the second largest producer of herbal products next only to China. The export of herbs and value-added extracts of medicinal herbs are gradually increasing over the years. India exported the worth of 3.30 ​× ​108  USD herbs during 2017–2018, with a growth rate of 14.22% over the previous year (Press Information Bureau Government of India Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 2019 ). The use of modern technologies like Internet of Things, remote sensing, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and big-data analytics can aid in sustainable forest management, and pilot projects utilizing these modern technologies in the Indian forestry sector are already in the active phase (Shah, 2020 ). The regular mapping of forest cover mapping using remote sensing and geospatial information system (GIS) techniques for three decades has been a remarkable achievement in the field of natural resource monitoring, which has played a pivotal role in the conservation of forest resources in India (Ashutosh and Roy, 2021 ). The Target 8.2 under SDG 8 emphasizes technological upgrading and innovation towards achieving a higher level of economic productivity. Ashutosh and Roy (2021)  clearly indicate that the usage of Indian Earth Observation Systems, GIS, and related technologies in the forestry sector have made successful attainment of the Target 8.2 under SDG 8. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has been regarded as the largest social safety net in the world. It aims at enhancing the livelihood security of households in rural India by providing guaranteed wage employment (Giribabu et al., 2019 ). Under the MGNREGA, social forestry activities and afforestation tasks that are aimed under the National Mission for a Green India are included (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 ). Ecological rejuvenation and regeneration are spun-off results from the MGNREGA, while the rural segment benefits from the implementation of these developmental works; this is a positive indication towards the targets 8.3 and 8.5 under SDG 8. JFM is a sustainable way of generating employment through forest-related management (Mishra et al., 2021 ). Moreover, in India, forest-based eco-tourism is an emerging business and provides employment opportunities for the local unemployed segment (Karanth and DeFries, 2010 ; Sharma et al., 2019 ; Prakash and Reddy, 2020 ). Thus, forest-based tourism sector helps in achieving the Target 8.9 under SDG 8.  4.9 SDG 9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Tomaselli et al. (2019)  have analyzed the forestry sector with respect to progression of SDG 9; their analysis confirms the positive and negative impacts of various targets that aim at industry, infrastructure, and manufacturing on forests. In recent times, forest-based industries like pulp and paper, incense sticks, silk, sandalwood, plywood, handicrafts, etc. are being pushed for forest certification to improve India’s forest management regime that is often criticized for various issues that ail the sector, such as forest rights, forest degradation, biodiversity losses, and encroachments. However, huge employment opportunities and economic value exist due to these industries. Given some of the serious and potentially irreversible impacts on forests from some targets and indicators of SDG 9, alternative socio-economic models and new development paradigms could be considered to mitigate some of these effects (Tomaselli et al., 2019 ). In a nutshell, there exists trade-offs between the targets of SDG 9 and the forestry sector.  4.10 SDG 10: Reduced inequalities Targets under SDG 10 call for reducing inequalities within and among the countries. All the policies and acts of Indian forests encourage the upliftment of the poor and vulnerable sections, including women that depend on the forests (Gill, 2016 ; Das and Sanskar, 2021 ; Diduck et al., 2021 ). Earlier, Gill (2016)  has instigated the intricate details of environmental justice in India with emphasis on genesis, operation, and effectiveness of the Indian National Green Tribunal; the results from this study indicated growing usage and public respect for the Indian National Green Tribunal’s commitment to environmental protection and the welfare of the most affected people. However, from the analysis of selected case studies, it is understood that even though Indian judicial systems have made significant improvement in reducing the inequalities, there is still a scope for enhanced interventions that are actionable at grass-root level (Diduck et al., 2021 ).  4.11 SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities Though cities act as social-economic forces, ignoring the consideration of green space, urban forests, and nature-based solutions in urban planning could result in further environmental degradation and have knock-on negative effects on human health and well-being (Devisscher et al., 2019 ; Ramaiah and Avtar, 2019 ). Urban forests are beneficial in mitigating urban heat island effects (Khare et al., 2021 ), reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ) (Liu and Li, 2012 ), and providing recreation facilities (Liu et al., 2021 ). The National Smart Cities Mission (NSCM) is an urban renewal and retrofitting program led by the Government of India with a mission to develop smart cities across the country, making them citizen friendly and sustainable (Smart-Cities, 2019 ). The performance analysis done by Prasad and Alizadeh (2020)  with respect to the NSCM concluded that the policymaking has responded to the earlier critiques regarding development of sustainable cities in India. The Indian National Forest Inventory includes the trees outside forests in urban areas (Forest Survey of India, 2019 ) and efforts are underway to implement urban forests in the nation through various schemes (Javedekar, 2020 ). This is a clear step to accentuate the Target 11.7 under SDG 11. Similarly, city forests are akin to green infrastructure in an urban landscape, where trees and associated vegetation provide an assortment of environmental services, such as cleaning the air, improving the local environment, and increasing the recreational and aesthetic value. In this regard, a recent study by Lele et al. (2020)  conducted in the Delhi National Zoological Park assessed the total annual economic value of the ecosystem services (including biodiversity conservation, employment generation, carbon sequestration, education and research, and recreation and culture), which was estimated as 56.90 ​× ​106  USD for the financial year 2019–2020. Their study highlighted the importance of habitats such as zoos for human well-being and the need of replicating similar studies across various urban landscapes and/or cities in India.  4.12 SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production Sustainable consumption and production could promote social and economic development within the carrying capacity of ecosystems, increase the efficiency and sustainability in the use of resources and production processes, and reduce resource degradation, pollution, and waste (Nanda, 2016 ). SDG 12 makes no direct reference to forests or forest-dependent people among its targets or indicators, despite there exists linkages between sustainable forest management and agricultural commodity supply (Schröder et al., 2019 ).  4.13 SDG 13: Climate action Forests have been integral to address the challenges of global climate change and play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Tropical deforestation and degradation are significant contributors to global carbon emissions (Louman et al., 2019 ). Forests capture and store CO2  in biomass and help store carbon in soils (Moomaw et al., 2020 ). Sustainable forest management that includes afforestation activities avoiding deforestation and can help in meeting 4.00%–20.00% of global CO2  emission-reduction targets required by the +2 ​°C limit of the Paris Agreement (Forsell et al., 2016 ). Indian forests play a role in carbon sink as a whole. From 1995 to 2005, carbon stocks stored in the Indian forests have increased from 6.24 ​× ​109  to 6.62 ​× ​109  ​t, registering an annual increment of 37.68 ​× ​106  ​t of carbon (138.15 ​× ​106  ​t of CO2  equivalent) (Kishwan et al., 2009 ). The carbon stock of Indian forests in both soil and vegetation for the period 2006–2030 is projected to increase (from 8.79 ​× ​109  to 9.75 ​× ​109  ​t), gigaton of carbon with forest cover becoming more or less stable, and new forest carbon deposits coming from the on-going initiatives of afforestation program (Ravindranath et al., 2008 ). At the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties 2015) (COP-2015) in Paris, the Government of India made a Bonn Challenge pledge to bring 1.30 ​× ​105  ​km2  of degraded land into restoration by 2020–2021 and an additional 8.00 ​× ​104  ​km2  by 2030 (Borah et al., 2018 ). India is committed to reducing the emission intensity of GDP by 33.00%–35.00% by 2030 from the level in 2005 through mitigation efforts across various sectors, and it is envisaged to create an additional carbon sink of approximately 3.00 ​× ​109  ​t of CO2  equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030 (Roy, 2020 ). India’s national policies and programs, such as the national mission on green India, the national afforestation program, compensatory afforestation, and state plantation campaigns, encourage and pursue afforestation and sustainable forestry. These policies and programs strengthen resilience to climate-related hazards and natural disasters and are well integrated into national policies to counter the challenges of climate change (synergetic to the targets 13.1 and 13.2 under SDG 13). The Government of India has directed all state governments and union territories to prepare the State Action Plan on Climate Change consistent with the strategy outlined in the National Action Plan on Climate Change. The National Action Plan on Climate Change has given states an opportunity to design their own custom development plans that can anticipate in, prepare for, and respond to hazardous events, trends, or disturbances related to climate and promote investments in low-carbon infrastructure. Most of the projects under the National Action Plan on Climate Change have education-related strategies strictly adhering to climate change knowledge and skill development also in areas such as forestry, biodiversity, health, water, and waste through the Strategic Knowledge Mission. These interventions correspond and link directly with the Target 13.3 under SDG 13 (Pahuja et al., 2020 ). The Food and Agriculture Organization (2020)  in their report mentioned that India ranks third among the top 10 countries that have gained forest areas during 2010–2020, with 0.38% or 2.66 ​× ​103  ​km2  gain in forested area every year at an average. The organization (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2020 ) also credited the Indian government’s JFM strategy for the significant increase in community-managed forest areas in Asia and endorsed India’s commitment towards the targets 13.a and 13.b under SDG 13.  4.14 SDG 14: Life below water SDG 14 emphasizes the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and marine resources. Activities like deforestation and degradation of forests create erosion and send sediments downstream, which can block the sunlight reaching the marine ecosystems. Securing and expanding forest areas and ensuring that forests are well-managed to support the targets of SDG 14 could reduce marine pollution from land-based activities (Forest Stewardship Council, 2018 ). The coastal and marine focus of SDG 14 means that it may have impacts on the coastal forested ecosystems, such as inter-tidal mangrove forests, beach dune forests, and tidal freshwater forested wetlands (Friess et al., 2019 ). The mangrove forests of India are globally unique with the highest record of biodiversity along the eastern coast of India, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sundarbans, and western coastal plains (Kathiresan, 2018 ). As per the studies done by Kathiresan (2018) , despite increasing pressure factors, the mangrove forest cover in India is increasing annually at the rate of 1.90% due to successful management strategies, as against the global mangrove forest cover that disappears at 0.66%. Efforts in this direction are a positive for the targets like 14.2 and 14.3 under SDG 14.  4.15 SDG 15: Life on land The claim that stewardship of terrestrial ecosystems, particularly forests and their rich biodiversity, is essential for sustainable development, and conservation of terrestrial life is recognized as goal 15 of the SDGs (Sayer et al., 2019 ). SDG 15 explicitly refers to focusing on forests, protecting and restoring forests, and making sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems to reduce the loss of biodiversity. The concurrent list of the Indian Constitution contains the subject of forest and wildlife. As per the Article 48A in the Indian Constitution, the states have the duty to ‘endeavor to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country’. Similarly, as per Article 51A in the Indian Constitution, every citizen has the duty to ‘protect and improve the natural environment, including forests, lakes, rivers, and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures’ (Bhullar, 2008 ). Tables 2–4     present the various policies that are in place for the protection of forests and forest-dependent species. Forest fire is a common natural hazard that negatively affects the environment and ecosystems; emissions from forest fires have an impact on regional and global air quality and rainfall patterns as they contribute to global warming and land degradation through the release of greenhouse gases (primarily CO2  and black carbon) (Martin, 2019 ). The UN SDGs do not explicitly mention forest fire, although many of the targets are affected by the adverse consequences of fires on ecosystem services. As the India’s centrally sponsored scheme, the Forest Fire Prevention and Management is specifically dedicated to assist states in dealing with forest fires. The guidelines under the National Action Plan on Forest Fires minimize the effects of forest fires by informing, enabling, and empowering the communities living in and around forests and incentivizing them to work in cooperation with the forest department. Efforts under the Forest Fire Prevention and Management and National Action Plan on Forest Fires cater to various protection mechanisms mentioned in the targets 15.5 and 15.7 under SDG 15. Tiger Reserves are an epitome of species protection in India. Saving the tigers (apex predator) requires saving the entire ecosystem and the natural habitat that support such large-bodied living organisms. Tiger reserves offer the highest degree of protection under the Wildlife (Protection) Act-1972, and over the past four decades, Project Tiger has been successful in supporting and increasing tiger populations. In addition, being the cornerstones of biodiversity conservation, tiger reserves also provide a wide range of economic, social, and cultural benefits in the form of ecosystem services (Verma et al., 2017 ). The findings from Verma et al. (2017)  showed that the monetary value of benefits emanating from the selected tiger reserves (six in total) ranges from 1.28 ​× ​108  to 2.71 ​× ​108  USD annually. In terms of area, this equates to 862 to 2923 USD/(hm2 •a). Verma et al. (2017)  also derived the ecosystem services value from tiger reserves, including employment generation, agricultural, timber, fishery resources, carbon storage, water provisioning, nutrient cycling, and biological control, besides preserving the cultural heritage and promoting recreation spots.  4.16 SDG 16: Peace, justice, and strong institutions SDG 16 embodies the targets that promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels (United Nations-Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015 ). The Indian forestry sector contributes to this goal in numerous ways. The enforcement of relevant laws by the Indian government is the basis of sustainable forest management, which is reflected in the forest and environmental commitments mentioned in concurrent list of the Indian Constitution. Policies, laws, schemes, and rules related to the Indian forestry sector govern the requirements regarding legal rights to harvest and harvesting activities, environmental and social requirements, and customary rights. Interventions such as the JFM strategy aim to establish better managed and more effective benefit-sharing mechanisms, and to deal with the issues related to forest fringe communities in innovative ways (promoting the Target 16.3 under SDG 16). Various indicators of SDG 16 require quantifying and reporting data related to forest information. Analyzing these indicators can inform the pressure points of forests as well as the degree of sustainability (McDermott et al., 2019 ). The Forest Survey of India has published 16 biennial publications (State of Forest Reports), which provide state/district-wise forest cover of the country and the changes therein with respect to the previous assessment by utilizing satellite data. These reports are made available to the public (Forest Survey of India, 1999, 2019 ) and adhere to the needs of the Target 16.6 under SDG 16. India’s proactive participation at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP-2015) as well as the commitments made in the Bonn Challenge strengthens the aim of participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance and thus acts as positives towards the Target 16.8 under SDG 16. The Indian National Forest Inventory and forest assessments are attracting increasing attention due to their role in providing information related to various forest functions. The new National Level Continuous Forest Inventory System of India has been conceived to form a basis for making continuing policies and planning decisions, including the role of forests as an ecosystem and a resource provider, which holds for all levels of forestry from local to global scales (Tewari et al., 2020 ). This stance clearly indicates how Indian forestry is strengthening the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance.  4.17 SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals Targets under SDG 17 strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. SDG 17 is the most comprehensive goal, bringing the other 16 goals together and their associated targets on finance mobilization, connecting people through information technology, international trade, and capacity building, and strengthening data collection and analysis, especially for the developing countries. Humphreys et al. (2019)  analyzed the nexus between forests and SDG 17 and concluded that SDG 17 promotes the need to increase financing levels for the sustainable forest management and increases cooperation among public, private, and non-governmental stakeholders. The Indian government has allied with numerous partnership programs with international organizations like the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Development Countries, the International Tropical Timber Organization, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the United States Agency for International Development, the Asia-Pacific Forest Invasive Species Network, Ramsar Convention, the World Bank, and the South-South Cooperation, etc. towards sustainable forest management.  4.18 Indian forestry sector’s contribution towards reaching the targets of SDGs Throughout the history, the forests are always been an important renewable resource. They play a vital role in the economic development, ecological balancing, and social wellbeing for a developing country like India (Rawat et al., 2008 ; Ahmad, 2011 ). The India’s National Forest Policy focuses on the maintenance of environmental stability, conservation of natural resources meeting the basic needs of the people, and also stabilization of the relationship between forest-dependent communities and forest governing bodies (Rawat et al., 2008 ). In recent decades, the range of goods and services sought for sustainable yield in India has vastly increased, with a focus on forest ecosystem services as they are integral parts of dynamic landscapes (Saigal et al., 2016 ). Indian forests are treated as national asset and the environmental policies of the central government have successfully integrated the principles of sustainable development. Fig. 2   shows the contributions of the Indian forestry sector to achieving the targets under SDGs.   5 Conclusions In this investigation, the nexus between Indian forestry system and SDGs is explored using the prevailing forestry governance and ecosystem services and by understanding the economic implications. Towards this, publications obtained from a database, authentic reports published by various ministries of the Indian government, proceedings of flagship projects, and interventions/schemes in the area of forestry and allied ecosystems are systematically reviewed. The outcome of this review highlights the effectiveness of Indian forest governance in addressing the issues of afforestation, biodiversity conservation, and future carbon storehouse; similarly, there are efforts to minimize the pressure on forest resources, thereby putting them as an integral part of food-energy-water cycle. Almost a quarter of the Indian geographical area is covered by diverse forests which have been proven to be an integral part of the Indian economy. Indian forests not only act as a source of livelihood for forest-dependent people, but also are a habitat to diverse flora and fauna. The results from this study confirm that various provisions for the protection of forests have been well placed in the concurrent list of the Indian Constitution, and are being supported by various policies, laws, acts, and rules that have led to both economic and ecological sustainability. Concepts like the JFM committees have not only led to local control of the resources but also acted as a path for conservation and promotion of socio-economic well-being. The nexus mapping between Indian forestry and SDGs completed through this review strongly confirms the contribution of forests’ role in poverty alleviation and livelihood support to forest-dependent communities. Even though India is primarily an agricultural country, the contributions from forest NTFP play a booster role in providing food security. The abundant medicinal plants of the country not only provide a holistic support to the medical sector, but also are instrumental in providing the necessary ingredients to pharmaceutical products. Adequate institutional setup is in place and are ready to take pro-environmental behavior with regards to forestry education. The participation of local, vulnerable sections, marginal communities, and women are being encouraged by various schemes and dedicated interventions do exist for the well-being of tribal communities. Recognizing the importance of forest-river interconnection towards provision of clean water, the Indian government has made successful forestry interventions in rejuvenating the rivers. Indian government’s commitments towards climate action are in full swing, as is evident from various interventions that have given a confidence boost to fulfilling the international norms for climate change by 2030. Clauses for protection, restoration, and promotion of sustainable use of forests and their ecosystems are well placed in the Constitution of the country, which ensures to fulfill the ambitions of SDG 15. Indian forestry setup is in a good handshake with the international institutes towards achieving the partnership goals. Indian forests are regarded as sacred natural assets and play a pivotal role in all dimensions of sustainable development, and the success can be attributed to the initiatives taken by the central government. This research outlines the synergies that are created between forest conservation and economic development by Indian forest governance; the future scope of this study can be on issues related to the trade-offs between economic growth and environmental sustainability with a special emphasis on forestry and associated ecosystems. Similarly, interventions with respect to the issues related to inequalities at grassroots level need better and new methods of introspection to find out the effectiveness of current forestry governance.
