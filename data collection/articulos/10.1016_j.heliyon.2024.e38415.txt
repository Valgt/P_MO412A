                  Fossil fuels are vital in the cooking field rather than the automotive sector. Hence, solar cooking has been popularized in recent years due to the rising cost of cooking gas. However, implementing successful renewable energy for cooking in urban area is still challenging for industries. Hence, a solar thermic cooking device with a compact size suited for domestic cooking in urban area is proposed. Thus, the solar cooking device will be developed as a fully functional prototype with necessary supporting modules, depending on the heat transfer fluid (HTF) flow and heat transfer rate between fluids. The main objective is to represent various computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and thermal analysis results on different optimistic designs for a solar thermoelectric cooking device's heat exchanger and storage unit. The 3D part model of the modules has been developed using SOLIDWORKS 2019 software. CFD has also been carried out using the same workspace with an additional package called flow simulation to analyze the flow properties of heat transfer fluid at different rates when circulated in other modules.
                  Moreover, the thermal behavior of the HTF concerning the heat transition between module surfaces is simulated using SOLIDWORKS flow simulation to evaluate the heat storage capacity and rate of heat transfer. The theoretical formulations for the modules are derived through thermodynamic equations concerning the materials and fluid involved in the unit. The thermal and CFD analysis is carried out for different optimistic 3D models based on thermal sustainability, and the results are compared with theoretical analysis, which is discussed in this paper.

Fossil fuels are vital in the cooking field rather than the automotive sector. Hence, solar cooking has been popularized in recent years due to the rising cost of cooking gas. However, implementing successful renewable energy for cooking in urban area is still challenging for industries. Hence, a solar thermic cooking device with a compact size suited for domestic cooking in urban area is proposed. Thus, the solar cooking device will be developed as a fully functional prototype with necessary supporting modules, depending on the heat transfer fluid (HTF) flow and heat transfer rate between fluids. The main objective is to represent various computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and thermal analysis results on different optimistic designs for a solar thermoelectric cooking device's heat exchanger and storage unit. The 3D part model of the modules has been developed using SOLIDWORKS 2019 software. CFD has also been carried out using the same workspace with an additional package called flow simulation to analyze the flow properties of heat transfer fluid at different rates when circulated in other modules. Moreover, the thermal behavior of the HTF concerning the heat transition between module surfaces is simulated using SOLIDWORKS flow simulation to evaluate the heat storage capacity and rate of heat transfer. The theoretical formulations for the modules are derived through thermodynamic equations concerning the materials and fluid involved in the unit. The thermal and CFD analysis is carried out for different optimistic 3D models based on thermal sustainability, and the results are compared with theoretical analysis, which is discussed in this paper.   Keywords Solar cooking device  Thermal and flow analysis  Molten salt analysis  Transient thermal analysis  Heat storage unit    1 Introduction Over 80 % of the world's energy consumption depends on fossil fuels. In recent years, the demand for fossil fuels has been amplified because of increased population and industrialization, resulting in increased fuel prices. The attention to environmental damages because of air pollutants caused by fossil fuel consumption significantly impacted significant industrial sectors. The auto industry has increased demand for petroleum products, and people are getting more concerned about environmental damage and its influence on human health. The economic cost spent on fossil fuel consumption has been estimated to be a gross total of PKR 138.03 trillion for coal, oil, and gas annually [1 ]. Hence, people are moving towards an electric future in the automotive and industrial sectors. However, when emphasizing the cooking field, fossil fuels are used as the primary source of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and natural cooking gases such as propane and butane. The rural area is an open swath of land with few homes and less population density. Agriculture is the primary industry in a rural area, with most farming people having vast farming lands. Traditional biomass cooking techniques are the foremost resource in rural areas and have significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In rural India, biomass fuels such as firewood, cow dung, kerosene, and charcoal biogas are used as the primary cooking source, releasing large amounts of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in smoke. They emit other air pollutants, around 500–2000 μg m−3  of suspended particles, 10–100 times more than modern fuels, and release significant SO2  [2 ]. LPG has been introduced for clean cooking to reduce SPM and other air pollutants. Still, few pollutants such as Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2 ), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), Sulphur dioxide (SO2 ), and Formaldehyde (HCHO) were lower when compared to the biomass fuels [3 ], which could cause respiratory and cardio-pulmonary health hazards. Thirugnanasambandam et al. performed a detailed review of solar thermal technology [4 ], Fatemi studied the feasibility of employing flat plate collectors in solar water heating systems [5 ], and Kumar and Ramakrishnan explored the domestic applications of solar thermal systems [6 ]. Under uncertain atmospheric conditions (solar irradiance and temperature), the power quality and stability of the grid-tied solar photovoltaic systems were analyzed using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy control system [7 ]. Zgham et al. found that mono-crystalline solar photovoltaic technology outperforms poly-crystalline in terms of energy output and performance ratio under the studied climatic conditions [8 ]. To comprehend the effect of indoor air pollutants on human health, an experimental trial was conducted with 180 participants aged 25–64 years for 2 years, resulting in reduced quality of life factors caused by inhaling household air pollutants [9 ]. Indoor solar cookers offer a solution to social acceptance issues, and a versatile day-round system is essential for modern cooking needs. The pilot study demonstrated the technological efficacy of a novel passive indoor solar cooker, promising a sustainable and efficient cooking solution [10 ,11 ]. In addition to that, LPG also emits a negligible amount of Sulphur dioxide (SO2 ) and SPM while burning, which could cause asthma and other respiratory allergies in children as per the study conducted and examined between 3456 children in India by Raj Kumar et al., in 2008 [12 ]. The price of LPG has gradually risen for the past 8–10 months and hiked INR 15 per cylinder in the past few months, currently selling at around INR 1118 per 14.5 kg domestic cylinder in India. LPG price has risen 76 % in a year from 665 USD per ton to 797 USD per ton and is further expected to increase by 20 % [13 ]. Even though electric cookware was introduced recently, it failed to fulfill domestic needs and increased electricity bills to the peak. Hence, using renewable energy for cooking is a significant way to achieve better cooking quality, which is getting acquainted among people, especially when using abundantly available solar energy as the prime source, commonly termed solar cooking [14 ,15 ]. Without revolutionary changes, the current cooking technology will increase India's GHG emissions by 24 % from 2012 to 2047 [16 ]. Solar cooking is one of the most significant ways to utilize renewable energy [17 ]. However, the traditional methods were not well recognized among urban and semi-urban people. The conventional solar cookware model is categorized into two primary methods: (i) Direct and (ii) Indirect, based on the operation procedure. Based on construction, the solar cookware was divided into three main types: (i) Box type, (ii) Concentrating type, and (iii) Panel type [14 ]. Traditional solar cooking has impactful drawbacks such as a larger footprint, outdoor operation, lack of control, and limited features [18 ]. It could exhibit only 30 %–60 % efficiency due to solar reflectors. Direct solar cookware was constructed so that the concentrated solar beam is engaged to focus on the utensil directly. Solar irradiance is used for cooking without any intermediate medium for heat transmission [19 ]. Parabolic reflector-based solar cooking is a reliable way to use dishes and troughs in the broader area of about 2–3 m2 . Parabolic reflectors must be placed in a wide outer space; thus, people must cook outdoors without shades. Moreover, a few risks may cause skin burns erroneously when in contact with the concentrated solar beam. In indirect solar cooking methods, thermodynamic oils have been used as a heat transfer medium operating at a maximum temperature of about 350 °C. Hence, it would be safer than direct cooking, where the heat energy is transmitted to the user's utensils through a heat transfer medium. To overcome the limitations in prior solar cookware models, hybrid solar cookware models could operate using photovoltaic solar panels to collect solar energy in the form of electricity. Then, the harvested electricity is stored in batteries, used to operate induction cookware. Even though it had additional user-friendly features, it exhibited lower operational efficiency than the direct type because of multi-energy conversional losses. Recent advancements bring the thermal storage system using phase-changing material (PCM), such as molten salt and paraffin wax, as the heat storage medium. The performance enhancement of PCM coupled with the solar thermal system was reviewed [20 ]. Sk-14 cookware has been developed using a 1.52 m2  aperture parabolic solar collector that takes 5 h to melt the nitrate salts completely with the solar irradiation of 850 W m−2  at an efficiency of 20 % [21 ]. In a box and panel type, an absence of storage units reduces the practical possibilities of using it in shades or cloudy days. The thermal storage unit is considered mandatory for high-temperature solar cooking applications. Most thermal storage systems use a eutectic mixture of molten salt (Solar salt) as PCM has a melting temperature of 220 °C and withstands up to 600 °C, which stores the latent heat. An experimental study was conducted where solar cookware with thermal storage was developed, which uses solar salt as the storage medium and could supply about 170–180 °C uninterruptedly. A 250 g of potatoes fried within 17 min in one heat charge is adequate. The storage unit has to be directly exposed to a concentrated solar beam from a parabolic through outdoors to restore the heat, and it takes 110 min to charge solar salt [22 ]. The major drawback is that the storage unit must be placed manually in a solar collector every time to charge the solar molten salt. The molten salts are available in various compositions and exhibit different chemical and thermal properties. Based on its properties, density, viscosity, melting temperature, and specific heat capacity, it could be used for thermal applications such as Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) and Thermal Energy Storage (TES). Nitrate salts are the most commonly used molten salt in solar power plants at an operating temperature above 250 °C. An article overviews the molten salt TES in concentrating solar power plants installed worldwide with a capacity of 21 GWh at the end of 2019. The molten salt TES is an inexpensive, non-flammable, non-pressurized, and non-toxic way to store the energy to provide superheated steam up to 550 °C [23 ,24 ]. The non-eutectic molten salt mixture (60 % Sodium Nitrate and 40 % Potassium Nitrate) was used for TES in commercial Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. The heat transfer salt has a similar composition as solar salt with an acceptable level of impurities for excellent thermo-physical properties; thus, it has a low melting point and thermal stability up to the maximum of 600 °C. Solar concentration using the Fresnel lens is a unique solution for optical solar concentration instead of reflecting radiations. It can generate very high temperatures at the focal point, about 1500–2000 K, within a few seconds. Moreover, a surface-treated Fresnel lens has a solar power density of 260 W cm−2  at the focus of 5 mm diameter, 2644 times concentrating the solar radiation on the aperture [25 ,26 ]. The solar cooking system with integrated rock-bed thermocline storage was studied, and the system's optimal configuration and economic viability were analyzed [27 ]. The novel dual-purpose solar concentrating cooker and a water heater design were introduced, and real cooking tests confirmed its excellent performance [28 ]. Recently, a hybrid solar thermal-electric powered cooking oven was designed and analyzed. It was found that the proposed device exhibits 63 % efficiency in hybrid mode which was more than for electric and solar mode [29 ]. A solar cooker with a parabolic dish collector was developed for indoor applications and found that the overall energy efficiency and exergy efficiency were 10.3 % and 0.18 %, respectively [30 ]. Based on the previous experimental and analytical studies, an overview of box-type solar cooking with heat storage units was reviewed [31 ], and it was found that Box-type solar cooking with heat storage material requires additional reflectors. The research found that a single solar cooker for a family with two members decreases a total of 148.3 kg of CO2  yearly [32 ]. An urban solar food cooking system with commercial-grade erythritol as PCM as a heat storage tank was developed. The designed device took considerably less time to cook food compared to other existing solar cookers [33 ]. The prioritization and current challenges of solar cooking technology in India were reviewed and found that insufficient marketing policies are identified as the significant factor for inadequate market deployment statistics [34 ]. The working of the cooktop thermosyphon heat transport device for the indoor cooking system was demonstrated and found that boiling of water time was reduced by 22–53 % [35 ]. As concluded from the literature study, the authors learned that the reflector-based solar cookware delivers lower efficiency rates, between 30 and 40 %. The storage unit has not been adequately insulated and embedded into the system for a seamless energy flow. Hence, a novel solar cooking device with integrated features is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of traditional solar cooking methods. Implementation of a distinct type of solar concentration technique intended to use a Fresnel lens optical concentrator instead of parabolic reflectors for practical focus with an efficiency of up to 70 % on clear sunny days. Two different compositions of molten nitrate salts tend to be used as HTF and TES, each having distinct thermo-physical properties and melting points of 140 °C and 220 °C, respectively. The proposed solar cooking device is designed as a domestic model for urban and semi-urban areas with compact size and commercial application. Its configuration, is similar to that of a split air conditioning system, making it particularly well-suited for urban areas due to its minimal space requirements. The system can be conveniently placed on a kitchen counter, like a traditional gas stove, with the heat source connected via a tube, similar to a gas line. The additional operational features, intuitive controls, and easy handling enhance user benefits. Furthermore, a requirement of minimal maintenance for the Fresnel lens ensures its ease of use and long-term reliability. This design offers a more compact and reliable solution compared to existing solar cooking systems, thereby enhancing user acceptance in real-world applications. To ensure durable operation regardless of climatic conditions, an optimized heat exchanger and thermal storage unit will play a critical role, aiming to develop a thermal barrier for 24/7 operation with a holding capacity of 8.24 MJ for nearly 24 h. An effective heat dissipation unit with a solid top for uniform heat transmission is required for the user utensils for cooking. A rigid refractory base to resist downside heat flow supports the heat dissipater unit. Developing an optimized design is the primary part of the work to bring up an effective result. Based on the literature study, an initial plan with basic functionality was developed. Then, the 3D model was created using the part modeling software SolidWorks to visualize the object in a 3D workspace. Furthermore, the operational effectiveness of 3D part models is evaluated by imposing them for thermal and flow analysis using flow simulations available with SolidWorks add-ons. Adding the specified material to 3D modeled components with definite physical and thermal properties provides better 3-D visualization of heat flow between units via HTF to comprehend the working principle of the simulated design. The initial design is evaluated based on previous research works. Then, based on the prior simulation results, designs are optimized to the extreme over-dimensionally or by altering the materials with virtuous thermal properties. Based on simulation results, the designs are being optimized for a while until satisfactory results arise to fulfill the cooking needs of a medium-sized family. Given the rising cost of cooking gas, the proposed research work responds to a real-world problem. Proposing a practical and renewable alternative has the potential for significant positive impacts, especially in regions where access to affordable cooking fuels is challenging. This research contributes to the broader field of renewable energy by advancing solar cooking technology. This has implications not only for household cooking but also for reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources. 1.1 Objectives ➢ To design a schematic arrangement for an effective solar cooking device, especially for domestic requirements in urban and semi-urban areas.  ➢ To select an appropriate experimental method to determine basic valuation parameters and materials.  ➢ To conduct the theoretical evaluation of models using thermodynamic relations and mathematical calculations.  ➢ To conduct thermal and flow analysis on developed 3D models using flow simulation for enhanced thermal and flow characteristics visualization.  ➢ Design optimization using several iterations to develop well-performed solar cookware with maximum operational efficiency.  ➢ Evaluate the simulation outcomes with the theoretical results to determine real-world practical losses.      2 Design of solar thermic cooking device Regarding the literature study, a novel design has been developed for practical solar cooking with predominant features apt for urban and semi-urban areas. Based on the fundamental research papers, the proposed solar cooking device was designed with improved structural design and was divided into two units, an indoor unit and an outdoor unit, which consist of four major components: (i) solar concentrator, (ii) heat exchanger, (iii) thermal storage unit, and (iv) heat dissipater interconnected through the heat transfer lines. 2.1 Designing scheme The solar cooking device has been designed to collect solar irradiation directly through heat utilizing an absorbent medium. The schematic representation of solar thermic cooking device is presented in Fig. 1  . The absorbent can convert the solar irradiation falling on it into valuable heat energy. Then, the absorbed heat will be transmitted to a heat transfer fluid, "Heat transfer salt," which flows through a copper line wound over the absorbent, similar to a heat exchanger assembly. Here, the molten salt absorbs the heat energy from the absorbent. Heat dissipation and thermal storage units were connected in series via thermally insulated transfer lines made of highly thermal-resistant material. Thus, the heat generated by the absorbent will be transferred to the thermal storage unit and then to a heat dissipation unit for user application through HTF. The cyclical assembly between all those necessary modules will produce an effective solar cooking model. The HTF will gain and lose thermal energy in a cyclic condition at the heat exchanger and dissipator. The overwhelmed heat energy generated while the device is not in use will be accumulated in a thermal storage unit for later use. Moreover, electronic components are integrated into the device to control the system's thermal activities according to the user's necessities. The heat dissipation unit is designed to have a solid metallic base on top to dissipate heat evenly to the user utensils. It is supported by a rigid thermal barrier to resist heat flow downwards. The storage unit uses molten salt as a thermal storage medium. It is insulated by a twofold walled vacuum-sealed casing for perfect insulation (zero heat loss) to the atmosphere or by a 50 mm thick glass wool insulation according to the manufacturing feasibility. The heat transfer between modules is the primary factor affecting a device's efficiency due to external energy losses. Thus, the mechanical designs of the proposed modules have to be optimized to their maximum based on the performance and manufacturing feasibility to attain maximum efficiency as the outcome. To evaluate the optimistic design, the thermal and flow analysis of components and the heat transfer fluid is conducted for optimal 3D models with various heat fluxes and temperature rates. The results were discussed, and conclusions were drawn for the optimized designs that could attain high operational efficiency.  2.2 3D modelling of parts The definite 1:1 scale of the prototype has been modeled using SolidWorks CAD modeling software. Real-view graphics are used to visualize the real-time representation of the product in a confined 3D workspace, as shown in Fig. 2  . The materials were selected based on the designing criteria, which can add up to the model to represent the actual visualization of the product in real-time. Solar Concentrator : Here, an optical concentrator has been used to converge solar irradiation in one sq. m into a highly concentrated beam at its focal point. A unique lens capable of converging the solar rays with a maximum optical efficiency than the commercial parabolic reflectors was used to achieve the required solar concentration. A solar concentrator uses a high-efficiency optical concentrator supported by rigid hollow metallic frame sections for better rooftop stability to manage strong wind gusts [36 ]. An angle adjusting mechanism has been included to fine-tune the lens angle based on solar incident angle and could lock in a particular position through a locking screw. The adjusting mechanism may be automated through a closed-loop motorized operation. The solar concentrator had supporting links to hold the heat-exchanging unit in its position and was designed to adjust the focal length. Heat Exchanger:  An enclosed structure for an effective heat exchanger is designed with the necessary provisions for adequate heat flow at appropriate areas. An absorbent of a rigid bar placed at the lens spot will absorb solar radiation and emit heat energy as the output. A heat-exchanging tube is wound around the absorbent, carrying heat transfer fluid as the thermal carrier. The inlet and outlet of the tubes are projected out of the dome for external connections. The HTF is pumped or naturally flows to the other modules from the heat exchanger via transfer lines well-insulated by heat insulators. Moreover, the inner surface of the heat exchanger dome was coated with IR reflective paint, which reflects the rays emitted from the absorber. A 50 mm thick thermal insulation was stuffed over the dome and covered by another dome crown on the outer side to attain effective heat insulation. Thermal Storage Unit:  The storage unit is a thermal battery where the accumulated heat energy is stored in latent heat for some time. In 2004, Herrmann et al. intended to investigate a two-tank storage system with heat transfer salt as the storage medium using a commercial solar trough in solar power plants at 600 °C [37 ]. The thermal battery consists of an internal heat exchanging unit, where a coil is immersed into the storage salt sump, which transmits heat from HTF to the storage salt. A definite transfer tube design determines the effective heat transfer between them. A vacuum chamber is dedicated and offered around the core of the thermal battery. It physically separates the storage salt sump (core) and outer casing and prevents heat loss to the atmosphere. Hence, the heat can be stored for a more extended time. Heat Dissipation Unit:  A dissipation unit transfers heat to the cookware top, which acts like a stove; users can place the utensils over there for cooking. It is an indoor unit that can be placed inside the kitchen like the commercial stove model for effortless cooking. The basic design of the dissipater has a solid top that dissipates heat evenly over the area and is supported by a refractory base to resist heat loss to the atmosphere. A specially designed tubular structure in a circular form will be the flow tube sandwiched between the metallic top and the solid base. The flow tube will be made of metal with high thermal conductivity for a better heat transfer rate and carry the HTF. Here, the heat gained by the HTF is dissipated to the user utensil and circulated back to the heat exchanger to regain energy.  2.3 Selection of materials and parameters An appropriate selection of materials will be the essential functional characteristics of the solar cooking device. The materials were selected based on their thermo-physical properties, exhibiting better thermal characteristics for excellent product outcomes. Solar Concentrator:  The Fresnel lens will act as an optical concentrator with concentric grooves on an acrylic sheet with a 5 mm thickness. Each succession concentric ring has a simple lens and provides a short focal length. Fresnel lenses are thin in structure compared to conventional convex lenses. Hence, it occupies a smaller area than the solar reflectors with a higher concentration ratio [38 ]. Absorbent:  An absorbent is a material that can absorb the energy in contact. In the proposed device, an absorbent is responsible for absorbing the solar radiation that falls on it in the form of heat energy. Thus, a material with high solar absorptivity (i.e., the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the surface) and thermal conductivity. Hence, copper has been selected as the absorbent, having well-suited thermal properties of 0.29 L mol−1  cm−1  thermal absorptivity and thermal conductivity of 386 W m−1 K−1 , respectively [39 ]. Copper absorbent's thermal absorptivity (emissivity) can be increased by coating with the black-colored medium. A solid copper bar is used as an absorbent with a crown-like structure at the top for a larger absorbent area. Solid copper can hold a definite amount of heat due to its specific heat capacity of 385 J K−1  kg−1  during the operation. Heat Exchanging Coil:  The copper absorbent was wound by a 12.7 mm copper tube carrying the HTF, where the absorbed heat is the HTF through the copper wall. The exchanging tube is wound like a coil, with 6–7 turns around the absorbent bar with smooth curves for a seamless fluid flow. Dome:  A dome is an enclosed structure around the absorbent and heat-exchanging tube made up of thermal resistant material (Inconel) having a low thermal conductivity of 15 W m−1 K−1  [40 ] among other materials with a wall thickness of 2 mm. Refractory base:  The copper absorbent and the dome will be placed in the refractory base. It can withstand the maximum temperature of 400 °C raised inside. A silica-based refractory material with low large thermal conductivity and low large thermal resistivity is used [41 ]. Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF):  A fluid used to transfer heat from one to another. Here, a non-eutectic mixture of molten nitrate salt (53 % KNO3 , 40 % NaNO2,  and 7 % NaNO3  with impurities) has been used as an HTF melting at 142 °C, operating up to 593 °C [42 ]. Transfer lines:  The modules are interconnected using transfer lines that carry HTF from one to another. It has also been made using Inconel (heat-resistant material) [40 ]as a pipe with a nominal diameter of 12.7 mm. The lines are insulated with a tight pack of insulation materials over the Inconel pipes. Heat Dissipater:  A circular top of solid copper with a thickness of 10–15 mm is used as a heat transfer plate, with groves at the bottom for placing above specially designed heat exchanging copper pipe—the copper pipe in the form of concentric circles connected alternatively between them for even heat flow. Similar molded circular concentric grooves were on the resistive base made of refractory material such as silica, with the least thermal conductivity of 1.3 W m−1 K−1  [41 ] and a rigid structure. Thermal insulation:  The heat exchanging dome was constructed with two Inconel walls and stuffed with thermal insulators. Glass wool with the least thermal conductivity of 0.023–0.04 W m−1 K−1 , can withstand temperatures up to 450 °C [43 ], which was suggested to resist heat and avoid thermal loss to the atmosphere. Thermal Storage Unit:  The thermal storage unit is generally termed thermal energy storage (TES), where the heat can be stored in a molten salt pool above 220 °C. An immersed copper coil carries heated HTF, transferring heat to the storage salt. For thermal storage applications, a binary solar nitrate salt has a composition of 60 % NaNO3  and 40 % KNO3  with an average specific heat capacity of 1520 J K−1  kg−1  [44 ]. Thus, the salt is kept inside a metallic chamber to withstand high temperatures and insulated by a thermal insulator around the chamber.   3 Mathematical Modelling & theoretical evaluation According to the working principle of solar thermic devices, various technical terms and parameters were considered to ensure the system's capability through mathematical calculations. The authors elaborate on the mathematical terms and parameters considered during this system's theoretical evaluation. 3.1 Parameters considered ➢ The annual average solar flux per sq. m on the earth's surface – 1000 W m −2   (per unit time)  ➢ The surface area of the Fresnel lens (Aa) – 1 m 2    ➢ Optical concentration efficiency of Fresnel lens (ƞo) = 70 %  [45 ]  ➢ The surface area of the absorbent at the focal point (Ar) = 0.00196 m 2    ➢ Mass of the absorbent (m) – 0.87 kg   ➢ The focal length of the Fresnel lens (f) – 1.2 m   ➢ Material considered to use as an absorbent – Copper (Cu)   ➢ Dimension of the absorbent = 0.06 × 0.085 mm   ➢ Specific heat of the absorbent (Cp) – 376.8  J⋅kg−1⋅K−1   ➢ Ambient temperature of the absorbent (To ) – 25 °C = 298.15 K      3.2 Mathematical calculations 1) Solar flux density, (Gsc) = Avg. solar flux density ∗ Area of aperture (lens).    =1000 ∗ 1.

The absorbent material should have high thermal conductivity for effective heat transfer between the absorbent and the molten salt. Here, "copper," which has high thermal conductivity among the reliable absorbent materials, was chosen.4) Rate of change of temperature per second at absorbent,   (ΔT) t = Q/(m∗Cp) = 700/(0.87∗376.8)    (ΔT) t = 2.13 °C/s. Hence, the absorbent can reach the working temperature (600 °C) within 4.7 min and reach the maximum temperature of 1000 °C within 7.8 min.5) Energy raised per second in the absorbent,   Q = Cpa∗ma∗(ΔT) t.    =376.8 ∗ 0.87 ∗ 2.13. Q = 698.2 W.6) The total thermal energy that can potentially be stored by an absorbent at 1000 °C is calculated as.   Qp = Cpa∗ma∗ΔT    =376.8 ∗ 0.87 ∗ 975Qp = 319.6 kJ   7) Energy required to raise the temperature of molten salt which is in contact with the absorbent up to 450 °C, Qr.    Mass of molten salt is in contact per unit time (mm) = 0.22 kg.Qr = Cpm∗mm∗ΔT    =1600 ∗ 0.22 ∗ (450–25) Qr = 149.6 kJ. The diameter of the exchanging coil around the absorbent was taken as 15 mm (0.015 m). Thermal conductivity of the HTF (Km) = 2.22 W m−1 K−1  (avg. value for Nitrate salts).8) Effective heat transfer from the absorbent surface (@ 600 °C) to molten salt is calculated as.   Qt = (K_m∗S.A∗ΔT)/l    = (2.22∗0.00782∗575)/0.015Qt = 668 W   9) Hence, the time required to raise the temperature of molten salt to 450 °C was calculated as.   T = (m_m∗〖Cp〗_m∗ΔT)/Q_t    = (0.22∗1600∗425)/668. T = 223.9 s ≈ 3.73 min.10) Hence, the mass flow rate of molten salt in the closed circuit was estimated as   Mm = 0.01 kg s−1     Suppose the system uses only 5 kg of molten salt (for calculation purposes) as the heat transfer fluid. In that case, the whole HTF will reach the temperature of 450 °C in 1.4 h (Approximately) and potentially store 3400 kJ of energy at the mass flow rate of 0.001 kg s−1 . Hence, 5 kg of salt can store up to 24,285 kJ of energy daily (10 h daily). For example, During the heat dissipation process at the user end, the molten salt loses its energy from 450 °C to 150 °C with a temperature difference of 300 °C (Approximately) through the effective surface area of 0.03 m2  (Effective dia. = 0.2 m).11) Hence, the heat energy supplied by the HTF medium to the user cooking pot has been theoretically calculated as,   Qs = (K_medium∗A∗ΔT)/l    = (79.5∗0.03∗300)/0.005. Qs = 143.1 kW  (for uncontrolled heat flow) [Here, the medium is taken as an iron (Fe) plate with 5 mm thickness for calculation purposes]  3.3 Estimation of user requirement Energy consumed by a user per day was estimated to be 23.19 MJ when using a conventional LPG stove. Hence, the energy consumed per hour has been calculated as 6.62 MJ, which is 6.4 kW h per day (average cooking time was 3.5 h daily). [∗If the LPG stove operates at 60 % efficiency, only the user can effectively consume 3.97 MJ of energy per hour. Therefore, the actual requirement of the user was estimated as 3.86 kW h]  3.4 Evaluated theoretical results The model (taken for calculation purposes only) can effectively supply the required energy of 1.8 kW for 3.74 h. It shows that the model can efficiently provide the power of 6.74 kW h per day. [∗The 5 kg system can store thermal energy up to 4200 kJ @ 550 °C max. The energy accumulation by the absorbent and the heat-exchanging dome was neglected during this calculation∗]   4 Methodology In this paper, the solar thermic cooking device will be well-engineered by optimizing the structural designs based on thermal flow analysis. Hence, a series of analytical techniques will be followed to analyze the designs using the analysis method for every design iteration. Thus, an optimized design will be generated as the outcome for all modules belonging to the cooking device. The detailed methodology is shown in Fig. 3  . The computational parameters were declared based on the thermo-physical characteristics of the selected materials. Estimating temperature and heat flux values initiates simulation from the theoretical thermodynamic results. The generated design was modeled using CAD 3D modeling software and then subjected to the simulation part after fixing the parameters, such as material and computational fluid properties. After the completion of the simulation, the generated results were extracted and compared with the theoretical results for evaluation. The difference between theoretical and practical results will provide a range of design optimization.  5 Results & discussion 5.1 Design analysis &optimization This part of the paper represents a systematic process of developing designs for the proposed solar cooking device. The initial component design was created with basic parameters and subjected to various thermal and flow analysis using an embedded software package. Based on the simulation results, the basic design of the components was optimized to the best, which would exhibit its better performance. Moreover, the design will be optimized based on the manufacturability and material availability to attain a fully functional prototype as cheaply as possible. A standard methodology for simulating modules under different parametrical inputs on an equivalent simulation environment has been derived. An appropriate simulation and analysis of the modules using software simulation platforms and the results will be extracted as graphical and numerical outputs to understand the results better. Initially, a 3D model of the proposed designs will be developed using the SolidWorks modeling software and rendered with material properties and visual effects for a better illustrative outcome. Moreover, the material selection applies the properties to each module that can be directly imposed to run the simulation study through the simulation wizard available in the SolidWorks add-ons.  5.2 Heat exchanger The absorbent and copper tube wound around it are the core responsible for energy conversion and transfer. The absorbent crown (top surface) is exposed to the concentrated solar beam, where thermal energy is accumulated and transferred to the HTF through exchanging coils. Thus, the computational fluid dynamic simulation was carried out to analyze the change in the flow of HTF through the flow tube around the absorbent. The HTF absorbs heat from the absorbent, and the temperature will increase to definite values within a specific period. The design of the heat exchanging unit has been optimized with well-engineered geometric modulations and based on consideration of manufacturing feasibility.  5.3 Simulation parameters The model has been subjected to mesh analysis, where the 3D model was split into elements of uniform size [46 ]. CFD analysis is carried out in the heat exchanger, with a total mesh element of 62275, including solid and fluid particles. In addition, some properties have been defined for calculation purposes, such as the type of heat transfer and flow, which is conduction and Laminar and Turbulent flow, respectively. The initial and boundary conditions are given in Table 1  . The rate of change of temperature of the fluid concerning the flow rate of fluid with the mass flow rate of 0.01 kg s−1 , which is 10 g s−1 , is calculated. The HTF has entered the flow tube at atmospheric conditions and tends to absorb the temperature from the absorbent due to conductive heat transfer between the absorbent and the flow tube. Once the temperature of the fluid reaches its phase transition state (150 °C ∼ 423 K), the solid particles are converted into the liquid, which tends to flow towards the outlet of the flow tube due to pressure difference.  5.4 Geometry considered The specified materials are wrought copper and copper to the absorbent. A flow tube was applied to the selected geometry for simulation, where the material properties were assigned to the geometry. A heat transfer salt has been chosen as the heat transfer fluid, which has the composition of Sodium Nitrate (NaNO3 ) and Potassium Nitrate (KNO3 ) mineral salts in the proportion of 3:2, respectively. The properties of molten salt are given below.✓ Specific heat ratio (Cp/Cv): 1.000   ✓ Molecular Mass: 0.0914 kg mol −1    ✓ Dynamic viscosity: 0.0010 Pa s   ✓ Specific heat (Cp): 1500  J⋅kg−1⋅K−1   ✓ Thermal conductivity: 0.5200 W m −1  K − 1      5.5 Primary model The heat-exchanging coils were initially designed in such a way that they have a larger area of contact with absorbent. Thus, a square cross-sectional copper tube with a 9 mm inner side has been designed to wound over the absorbent with eight total turns, holding 0.0001 m3  of HTF per unit time. The analysis and simulation were carried out using the SolidWorks 2019 software package with flow simulation to determine the heat transfer and the flow rate of HTF between modules. The primary model of a heat exchanger and CFD simulation are shown in Fig. 4  a and b respectively. The flow analysis results represent the HTF flow into the tube at atmospheric conditions. The temperature transition of the HTF is noticeable as the HTF passes through every level of the copper winding. The maximum temperature the HTF reaches is around 600 K at the outlet. The copper absorbent reaches almost 600 K, and the heat is transferred to the HTF due to conductive heat transfer. Its temperature rises to 400 K within 120 s (258 iterations) at the flow rate of 10 g s−1 .  5.6 Optimized model Upon considering the material availability standards and the manufacturing feasibility, geometric optimization was carried out, where the copper absorbent dimensions were altered to the optimum. Due to the readiness of standard copper tubes, the coil was changed to a 12.7 mm tube with a wall thickness of 0.5 mm. Moreover, the fabrication of a squared coil was measured as a difficult task and replaced by standard circular cross-sectional tubes, which will wind over the absorbent's helical grooves, or else, copper fillings are placed between coils to provide a larger heat transfer area. The optimized heat exchanger is shown in Fig. 5  a. The optimized heat exchanger design consists of 5 turns only because of the increase in coil diameter by 3.8 mm for the seamless flow of HTF, which can hold the same quality of salt as the primary model. Because of geometric optimization alone, the optimized design has been subjected to thermal and flow analysis with the same simulation parameters and boundary conditions. In addition, the flow direction of HTF through the coil has inverted for even heating instead of making contact with the high-temperature side will improve the system's stability. Then, the results were extracted and equated to the primary model to identify the level of optimization with high feasibility. The CFD results indicate that the HTF can heat up to 660 K at the maximum when it reaches the coil outlet. Here, the crown temperature has been given as 873 K, which is 600 °C initially; the bottom end of the copper absorbent also reaches up to 700 K due to conductive heat transfer in 58 s (131 Iterations). The simulations were carried out at atmospheric pressure throughout the process; in case of additional pressure rises, it will be compensated by the safety pressure regulators fitted to the transfer lines. Moreover, the range of thermo-physical characteristics was obtained from the simulation and shown in Table 2  . Hence, the analysis and simulation results of the primary and optimum models intimate that the optimum model can heat HTF to the desired temperature within a shorter period than the primary model required. Change in flow direction improves the heat transfer and enhances the heating-up process.  5.7 Heat dissipator A thermal dissipator has a solid structural design of metals and insulators in a desired pattern. A specific design of circular flow tubes of copper has been placed between the refractory bottom base and the solid copper top. The HTF flows through the tube at high temperatures and evenly distributes heat via the copper top. Hence, the CFD analysis has been carried out to comprehend HTF's thermal and flow behavioral characteristics. HTF has a standard flow rate of 0.01 kg s−1  throughout the process, heat is lost when it passes through the flow tube due to thermal dissipation according to the heat transfer rate. The model has been subjected to mesh analysis, where the 3D model was split into elements of uniform size. CFD analysis is carried out, which has a total mesh elements of 69392, including both solid and fluid particles. In addition, some properties have been defined for calculation purposes, such as the type of heat transfer and flow, which is conduction and Laminar and Turbulent flow, respectively. Hence, the rate of change of the fluid's temperature concerning the fluid's flow rate with the mass flow rate of 0.05 kg s−1  is calculated. Where the HTF has entered the flow tube at atmospheric conditions and dissipates heat to the copper top due to conductive heat transfer between them, there will be some heat losses to the atmosphere due to conduction occurring with a refractory base. Thus, accumulated energy in HTF will dissipate to the copper top and the user utensils. Hence, simulations have been carried out to comprehend the rate of heat dissipation and the thermal behavior of HTF and solids concerning time.  5.8 Geometric consideration Dissipator has been designed to have a circular top section for effective utensil placement. A 12.7 mm copper tube is fabricated as a circular concentric coil (flow tube) with alternate connections in between them for effective fluid flow and heat distribution. The base and top of a heat dissipator have proper provisions to place the flow tube with restricted movement. The heat dissipator also has been optimized to provide an effective heat transfer rate at the same flow rate as HTF.  5.9 Model The heat dissipator consists of four parts assembled one over the other in a sequence, as shown in Fig. 6  a. Two layers of thermal insulators (refractory liners having a thermal conductivity of 0.3 W m−1 K−1 ) were placed at the bottom, one over another. The top refractory layer has provisions to place HTF inlet and outlet flow tubes. The flow tube has been placed over the refractory liner and covered by a copper disc over the flow tube. The high thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of copper provide adequate heat dissipation. CFD and thermal analysis have been conducted on the heat dissipator where the initial temperature of HTF is 400 °C (∼673 K) at the inlet. The thermal simulation exhibits the heat dissipation over the surface from HTF based on its flow throughout the analysis time of 169 s, which takes around 276 iterations. At 400 °C, the HTF is at a pure liquid phase and efficiently tends to flow in a heat dissipator. Simulation results represent the cut plot view where the thermal flow at the middle of the heat dissipator is shown in Fig. 6 b. The heat-carrying HTF transfers heat to the conductive surfaces at the edges in 20 s and brings the whole cross-sectional surface to the desired temperature in 15 s, as represented in Fig. 5 b. The proposed initial design of the heat dissipator has been analyzed, and the results are optimistic and satisfactory. Hence, the optimized design has been considered, and no further optimization has been done for the heat dissipator. The range of thermo-physical properties of materials for the heat dissipator is recorded while the simulation is carried out and represented in Table 2 .  5.10 Thermal storage unit A unit can store energy in the form of heat, commonly known as Thermal Energy Storage (TES) or thermal battery. Hence, the unit uses molten mineral salt as the storage medium, enclosed by a metallic structure and insulated by thermal insulation. Thus, a double-walled structure has been designed to make an effective model. A similar heat exchanging unit is used in a storage unit to transfer heat from HTF to the storage salt. Binary solar nitrate salt is preferred as a storage salt that can hold thermal energy at about 400 °C and up to 590 °C without changing its thermal properties.  5.11 Simulation parameters A refined mesh analysis is conducted on the 3D model and split into mesh elements of uniform size. In the heat exchanger, a transient thermal simulation study is used to simulate the thermal characteristics of a storage unit concerning time. The thermophysical properties of storage salt and the casing are user-defined for calculation purposes such as the type of heat transfer rate and to analyze the storage capacity of the unit based on its construction. The initial conditions for TES are given in Table 1 . For the simulation parameters, the thermal capacity of molten salt is analyzed on specific environmental characteristics. Thus, the heat loss to the atmosphere from the storage unit will be simulated based on the material's conductive and convective heat transfer properties. Here, the storage unit's construction is vital to the specified material. Thus, the effect of structure in storing thermal energy will be observed during the simulation. 5.11.1 Geometry consideration A design has been made to store thermal energy where the storage medium (solar salt) is held inside a core shell insulated and covered by an outer shell. Hence, the inner shell was supported by insulators at minimal contact points to restrict movements. The heat-exchanging coil has been kept in the core; thus, the extended coil up to the outer terminal is well insulated to avoid contact with the outer shell. A coil made of copper material is used to better transmit heat to the salt.   5.12 Primary model Initially, the storage unit was designed as a cylindrical structure made of Inconel material with high thermal resistance at a thickness of 5 mm. The exchanging coil was defined as a U-tube at a diameter of 10 mm, as shown in Fig. 7  a. For thermal insulation, a vacuum chamber has been created between the inner and outer metallic shells for a distance of 50 mm. Moreover, the silver reflective coating was applied to the shells to avoid heat loss via radiation. A rigid epoxy or an iso-thermal insulator that could withstand up to 450 °C without losing thermal stability is used between two shells to provide rigid support to the core with minimal contact area. Transient thermal analysis has been carried out using the SolidWorks simulation wizard to analyze the thermal storage unit's heat storage capacity, and the results are shown in Fig. 7 b. Hence, the heat-exchanging coils were initially considered to be at a temperature of 400 °C. Then, the heat transfer to the storage salt and the heat loss to the atmosphere were observed through simulation outcomes. The convective heat transfer rate between the outer shell and the atmospheric air has been taken as 25 W m−2  K−1  for transient analysis. Hence, the simulation results will determine the unit's storage capacity. The results revealed a maximum storage capacity of 673 K. As discussed, the U-shaped copper tube has been used as the heat exchanging unit at a constant temperature of 400 °C, surrounded by solar salt (for storage), and bounded by a metallic surface made of Inconel. Transient thermal analysis was carried out for the geometric model; the results are shown in Fig. 6 b, representing the temperature change rate concerning change in time. Thus, the results showed that the heat was uniformly transmitted to the storage salt and well insulated by the 50 mm vacuum chamber. The total quantity will heat up to 673 K in 0.8 h from room temperature (300K); moreover, observe that the supporting insulators conduct heat and partially rise to the temperature of 400 K. The primary battery can hold only 0.21 kg of molten salt within the 0.0001 m3  volume, storing an energy of 125.3 kJ.  5.13 Optimized model Considering the manufacturing feasibility and material availability, the thermal storage unit has been optimized to maximize efficiency within the feasibility limit. Hence, the Inconel material for transfer lines has been replaced by stainless steel-304 (SS304) material based on the availability of materials. A 3 mm wall thickness SS304 plate is used with proper insulation and iso-thermal coatings to increase its thermal resistance. The vacuum chamber between the shells is replaced by glass wool material for insulation, which has the most negligible thermal conductivity of 0.03 W m−1 K−1 . Hence, the glass wool between the shells will act as a thermal barrier, and rigid insulators are also placed to support the core shell. Moreover, the heat-exchanging coils were redesigned to have multiple helical turns to create a larger contact area with storage salt. It will increase the heat transfer rate, reducing the heat energy storage time. The optimized design of the thermal storage unit is shown in Fig. 8  a. Like the primary model analysis, the optimized model has also been subjected to simulation for the same analytical parameters to analyze the models under similar environmental conditions. Under the same simulation environment, the optimized model was exposed, and the result represented that storage salt reached up to 450 K in 4.16 h. However, the thermal resistance of insulating material is well-worked where the outer wall is still under atmospheric conditions even after time. The findings demonstrate an apparent enhancement in the heat transfer performance of the molten salt receiver when utilizing a spiral tube. This design significantly reduces radiation and convection losses, leading to improved efficiency. The receiver's ability to absorb heat from solar radiation is maximized by employing the spiral tube configuration due to the increased surface area available for heat transfer. Furthermore, the spiral tube promotes better fluid flow, facilitating enhanced convective heat transfer and ensuring a more efficient distribution of thermal energy. Consequently, these improvements contribute to a notable reduction in radiation and convection losses, ultimately enhancing the molten salt receiver's heat transfer capabilities [47 ]. Redesigned exchanging coils transfer maximum heat to 14.96 kg of storage salt within 0.008 m3 , as shown in Fig. 8 b. Harnessing solar energy mitigates global warming, alleviating environmental concerns with renewable and sustainable power generation [48 ].   6 Concept validation The proposed split solar cooking system utilizes the core principle of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), in which a Fresnel lens plays a pivotal role in converting solar irradiance into a concentrated heat source. In this study, the device was designed and simulated under ideal conditions, assuming a solar irradiance of 1000 W/m2 , representative of the average solar irradiance in tropical regions. To validate the concept, a Fresnel lens with an area of 1 m2  was tested on February 24, 2022, at 1:00 p.m. During the test, the lens achieved a focal point temperature of approximately 540 °C, under a Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) of 883 W/m2 , as recorded in the Solcast Solar Radiation Database [Solcast_site_80.270721_13.08268]. This experimental data underscores the device's reliability under real-world conditions. Furthermore, a first-phase working prototype has been developed which exhibits an operating efficiency of 35 % during testing. Further enhancements have been planned to improve the system's efficiency in future works.  7 Future scope A full-fledged prototype is currently under development and undergoes testing under a range of environmental conditions, including morning, noon, evening, and cloudy scenarios, among others. These comprehensive datasets will be instrumental in our future work to ensure the reliability and durability of the proposed system.  8 Limitations and further recommendations 1. Weather Dependency: Solar cooking devices are highly dependent on sunlight. Cloudy days, nighttime, or locations with limited sunlight could challenge consistent and reliable cooking.• This can be overcome by including a backup or supplementary heating system that can be used during cloudy days or at night.  • This could involve incorporating energy storage systems or alternative heating sources.     2. Initial Cost: Solar technologies, including thermic cooking devices, can cost more upfront than traditional cooking methods. Assess the economic feasibility and potential barriers to adoption, especially in areas with lower income levels.• Part of the initial cost can be funded by government subsidies, grants, or financial incentives to reduce the initial cost for consumers.  • Collaborate with NGOs or other organizations that support sustainable and renewable energy initiatives.     3. Storage Capacity: The ability of the device to store and retain heat may be limited. This could impact cooking duration and the ability to store energy for later use, especially during periods of low sunlight.• Storage capacity can be enhanced by advancing the insulation properties of the storage unit to minimize heat loss.  • Research advanced materials or technologies that can improve heat retention over longer periods.     4. Cooking Capacity: Depending on the size and design of the device, it may have limitations on the amount of food it can cook at once.• Cooking capacity can be enhanced by designing the device with modular components scaled up based on cooking needs. Allow users to connect multiple units if more cooking capacity is required.     5.

Regulatory and Safety Compliance: Ensure the cooking device complies with safety standards and regulations. Address any safety concerns related to using specific materials, heat transfer fluids, or other components.• Working closely with regulatory bodies and standards organizations can ensure regulatory and safety compliance.  • Obtain certifications that can instill confidence in consumers regarding the device's safety.        9 Conclusions This work proposes an innovative method for utilizing abundant solar energy through an indirect solar cooking technique. The proposed solar thermic cooking device demonstrates an impressive efficiency rate of over 60 %, surpassing other harvesting methods that exhibit only 20–22 % efficiency. This study uses thermal flow simulation tools to develop and simulate structured 3D models of crucial device units. The simulation results allowed for the evolution of the initial design to an optimistic model, which achieved higher efficiency rates than the preliminary models. In particular, the heat exchanger design is considered a crucial part of the system. It is optimized to its maximum performance based on the studies and updated geometric preferences due to manufacturability. The preliminary design of the exchanger can raise the temperature of the heat transfer fluid to 400 K within 120 s. In contrast, the optimized model can exhibit its performance 1.5 times that of the preliminary one due to its curved groove design in the copper absorbent. It raises the temperature of HTF to 660 K in 58 s at the same flow rate of 10 g s−1 . The curved groove design predominantly increases the surface area of contact between the absorbent and flow tube, resulting in excellent efficiency. Likewise, the thermal storage unit has been designed initially concerning the previous works and further optimized through crucial design changes, which improves its heat transfer rate to the storage salt up to 450 K in 4.6 h, which is well simulated. Thus, the thermal storage unit's transient thermal analysis was done to determine its maximum storage capacity. The preliminary model using a walled vacuum insulator is best when replaced with glass wool insulation because of its simple construction. The insulation characteristics of glass wool are improved through increased wall thickness to achieve effectiveness similar to vacuum insulation. The heat dissipator is subjected to a thermal simulation. It exhibits an expected performance of the surface heat up to 570 K in 20 s if the system is sufficient to supply the HTF at 673 K. Thus, the preliminary model of the heat dissipator is considered the optimistic design for a higher efficiency rate. Therefore, the paper describes the thermal optimization of the key components of the proposed solar thermic cooking device based on its performance using CFD and thermal simulation tools. The optimized heat exchanger and thermal storage unit models demonstrated exceptionally high efficiency rates. Furthermore, the executed numerical simulations reveal that, with the implementation of the primary model, the rate of temperature change in the HTF at the heat exchanger is approximately 1 °C per second - a value that is half of the anticipated analytical projections. In contrast, when utilizing the optimized absorbent model, the HTF demonstrates a temperature increase three times greater than the corresponding analytical projections. These results suggest that, based on the simulations, the HTF can attain a temperature rise of up to 450 °C within 68 s. The observed disparity between the simulated and analytical results may be ascribed to the exclusion of certain parameters in the analytical design. This study posits the viability of employing the concentrated solar power technique in indirect solar cooking methodologies, incorporating molten salts as the heat transfer medium. Moreover, This work highlights the potential of the proposed solar thermic cooking device as a modernized solution for utilizing solar cooking techniques, with the possibility for further development in real-time applications. The future scope includes developing a fully functional solar thermic cooking device with extended features. Other studies and improvements in this work can lead to an enriched product accessible to the general public.
