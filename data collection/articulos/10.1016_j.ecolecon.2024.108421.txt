                  Reaching the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs) is influenced by a country's position in global value chains and its involvement in international trade. Here, we assess how changes in global trade patterns (CGTP) during 2004 and 2014 impacted 13 SDG indicators in 141 countries/regions which are further divided into four income groups. Trade pattern is characterized by the direction, composition, and magnitude of trade, indicating an economy imports what types (composition) and magnitudes of goods or services from where (direction). We find that CGTP aggravated socioeconomic and environmental inequality between countries in two ways: 1) the amount of indicators that significantly worsened due to CGTP decreased from 8 indicators (2004–2007) to 1 (2011–2014) for high-income and upper-middle-income countries, but increased from 5 to 14 for lower-middle-income and low-income countries; 2) CGTP led to a coupling of value added with most natural resource consumption and environmental pollution indicators for low-income countries, while they strengthened decoupling or reducing coupling for other countries. The findings imply one key to achieving SDGs is to address the inequality between rich and poor countries through implementing policy interventions that influence import and vertical supply chain thereby shifting the trade patterns towards environmental-economic decoupling in poor countries.

Note that “Ind” is short for indicator.  Fig. 1   Fig. 2 Impacts of changes in global trade patterns on income groups. The size of the bubbles indicates percentage change. White bubbles and grey bubbles stand for negative and positive percentage change, respectively. a) Impacts of changes in global trade patterns from 2004 to 2007. b) Impacts of changes in global trade patterns from 2007 to 2011. c) Impacts of changes in global trade patterns from 2011 to 2014. d) Number of indicators that were negatively affected by changes in global trade patterns with percentage changes higher than 5 %.  Fig. 2   Fig. 3 Coupling versus decoupling impacts of changes in global trade patterns. The horizontal axis represents the percentage change in value added and the y-axis represents the percentage change in indicator in a single time period. The red line represents the boundary between coupling and decoupling, where data points below the red line refer to decoupling, while data points above show coupling.

Reaching the UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs) is influenced by a country's position in global value chains and its involvement in international trade. Here, we assess how changes in global trade patterns (CGTP) during 2004 and 2014 impacted 13 SDG indicators in 141 countries/regions which are further divided into four income groups. Trade pattern is characterized by the direction, composition, and magnitude of trade, indicating an economy imports what types (composition) and magnitudes of goods or services from where (direction). We find that CGTP aggravated socioeconomic and environmental inequality between countries in two ways: 1) the amount of indicators that significantly worsened due to CGTP decreased from 8 indicators (2004–2007) to 1 (2011–2014) for high-income and upper-middle-income countries, but increased from 5 to 14 for lower-middle-income and low-income countries; 2) CGTP led to a coupling of value added with most natural resource consumption and environmental pollution indicators for low-income countries, while they strengthened decoupling or reducing coupling for other countries. The findings imply one key to achieving SDGs is to address the inequality between rich and poor countries through implementing policy interventions that influence import and vertical supply chain thereby shifting the trade patterns towards environmental-economic decoupling in poor countries.   Keywords SDGs  Global trade patterns  Decoupling  Inequality  Input-output  Decomposition   Data availability Data will be made available on request.   1 Introduction In 2015, 193 nations committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, announcing 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) with 169 associated targets. The goals and targets will guide future human activities in three interconnected and indivisible sustainable dimensions, related to economic, social, and environmental aspects of development (United Nations (UN), 2015 ). The achievement of the SDGs may be affected by international trade, given that trade leads to a massive geospatial transfer of economic, social, and environmental benefits and burdens (Xu et al., 2020 ). Research has shown that up to 70 % of such impacts can be transferred through trade (Wiedmann and Lenzen, 2018 ). These trade patterns are subject to change driven by changes in technology, demand, prices, and other global forces (Lund et al., 2019 ). For example, most recently, we could observe the relocation of the early production stages in the global value chains being relocated from China and India to lower income economies, especially after the global financial crisis in 2008 (Meng et al., 2018 ; Yuan et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ; Wang et al., 2024 ). The increasing share of flows between developing countries has led to worldwide changes in employment and environmental burden because developing countries tend to have relatively low labor productivity, production efficiency, and lower levels of environmental regulation, monitoring, and enforcement (Wiedmann and Lenzen, 2018 ) but also tend to be located at the more polluting parts of the global supply chain (Prell et al., 2014 ). In addition, this reorganization of global trade has posed noticeable impacts on each component of sustainable development, for instance, contributing to an uneven distribution of material extraction (Schaffartzik et al., 2019 ), land use (Prell et al., 2017 ), and income (Bensidoun et al., 2011 ), between and within countries (Feng et al., 2013 ; Mi et al., 2017 ; Duarte et al., 2019 ). A large number of previous studies evaluated environmental pollution or resource extraction embodied in international trade, but the scope is usually limited to a specific aspect of sustainable development, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Chen et al., 2018 ), land (Yu et al., 2013 ), human appropriation of net primary productivity (Dorninger et al., 2021 ), particulate matter (PM) emissions (Tessum et al., 2019 ), water pollution (Oita et al., 2016 ), and associated health implications (Lin et al., 2019 ), or carbon-water-food nexus (Fan et al., 2022 ). A few studies incorporated multiple indicators, but with less focus on lower income countries (Tukker et al., 2016 ) or were limited to a specific region (Yang et al., 2020 ). For example, Xu et al. (2020)  evaluated the impacts of international trade on achieving nine environmental SDGs for 40 countries, but lower income countries were highly aggregated and socio-economic SDGs were not considered. Analysis on the impacts of changes in global trade patterns on lower income countries and on a wider range of sustainable development indicators is still missing. Moreover, the impacts of international trade on sustainable development can significantly differ between countries. Because of differences in terms of labor productivity, technology, efficiency, governance, and environmental regulation, trade not only enables countries to benefit economically from participating in global supply chains, but also shifts both location and magnitude of social and environmental impacts (Mongelli et al., 2006 ; Acquaye et al., 2017 ). There is a substantial body of literature that argues that the benefits and costs triggered by international trade are imbalanced between countries (Wang et al., 2020a ; Chen et al., 2021 ; Xiong and Wu, 2021 ; Dorninger et al., 2021 ; Cheng et al., 2023 ) and that international trade helps rich countries avoid environmental losses at the cost of increasing environmental burdens in poor countries (Xu et al., 2020 ). For example, for simple extractive sectors, the global share of sulfur dioxide driven by US consumption for core countries is only 16 % whereas its global share of value added is 77 %, while the global share of sulfur dioxide and value added for periphery countries are 17 % versus 4 %, respectively (Prell et al., 2014 ). Core countries tend to be higher-income and industrialized countries whereas countries at the periphery tend to be low-income countries (Wallerstein, 2011 ; Prell et al., 2014 ; Prell and Feng, 2016 ; Prell et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, Presberger and Bernauer (2023)  analyzed panel data on environmental impact flows among 187 countries from 1990 to 2015 to investigate the drivers of environmental impact shifting. They found that wealthier nations with greater domestic income equality tend to “outsource” environmental burdens to poorer, more unequal countries, and discrepancies in democracy levels exacerbate this trend, while environmental clauses in preferential trade agreements offer a partial mitigation. Therefore, assessing the impacts of international trade and its changing patterns on sustainable development for different types of countries provides a better understanding of the roles of countries at different income levels in global value chains and the potential implications for different SDGs. Here, we focus on changes in global trade patterns and evaluate their impacts on sustainable development for 141 countries or regions. In this study, trade patterns refer to the share of imports from different countries, and the impacts of changes in trade patterns are evaluated by simulating trade patterns in different years with other factors (e.g. production technology and intensity coefficient) unchanged. In addition, we compare countries at different levels of income and explore whether impacts differ between high- and low-income countries. The detailed regional classification provides a comprehensive evaluation that includes low-income countries which happen to be the ones facing the greatest challenges and deserving special attention towards achieving SDGs. This study answers the following questions: first, what are the global impacts of changes in global trade patterns on different SDG indicators and how do these impacts change over time? Second, how do these impacts differ between countries? Third, are the changing patterns of global trade beneficial to decoupling of each SDG indicator from value added in different countries? To answer these questions, we selected 13 indicators that are closely related to international trade and can be clearly quantified as a proxy for twelve SDGs, covering all three dimensions of sustainable development. The 13 SDG indicators include economic indicators, i.e. GDP, wages, and taxes on production; natural resource consumption and environmental pollution indicators, i.e. water pollution, blue water consumption, blue water withdrawal, total fossil fuel consumption, mineral resource use, CO2  emissions, PM emissions, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and forest area loss; and social indicators, i.e. high- and medium-skilled labor. The list of the indicators and the corresponding goals are shown in Table 1   (see more details in Methods and data). Using multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis and structural decomposition analysis, we quantify the entire impacts embodied in trade related to 13 SDG indicators and distinguish the impacts induced by changes in global trade patterns for three time periods, which are 2004–2007, 2007–2011, and 2011–2014 (see more details in Methods and data).  2 Methods and data 2.1 SDG indicators The “Global Indicator Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and Targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Report” (United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), 2020 ) operationalized the conceptual goals by proposing a series of quantifiable “sub-targets”, providing us with a reference to select indicators. Given that both production characteristics and share of trade volume vary by sector, the indicators we choose must be supported by sub-sectoral data, which is exactly the advantage of the satellite data of MRIO tables. Thus, we matched the satellite account of the EXIOBASE MRIO table and the sub-targets proposed by UNSD, and finally selected 13 indicators corresponding to 12 goals (see Table 1 ). The indicators we chose are highly correlated with the goals and can be clearly quantified. In our study, we used more than 300 out of 1104 indicators of the EXIOBASE satellite account and aggregated them into 13 SDG indicators (see comparison table in Table A.1  of Appendix); other indicators have no explicit relevance to the SDGs. By reconciling the EXIOBASE satellite account with the GTAP MRIO table, our study managed to cover all three dimensions of economy, society, and environment that the SDGs emphasized.  2.2 MRIO analysis Input-output analysis is widely used to measure socio-economic and environmental flows (e.g. energy, water, CO2 , labour, GDP) along supply chains (Wang et al., 2020b ; Wang et al., 2020c ). Based on the input-output table and the extended satellite, the input-output analysis can directly calculate in matrix form the socio-economic and environmental outcomes that are embodied in imports and exports between different countries and sectors, which are also known as virtual flows or flows embodied in trade. Moreover, global MRIO analysis and its databases allow for monitoring sustainable development progress globally (Wiedmann and Lenzen, 2018 ). In this study, we applied global MRIO analysis to calculate employment, resource consumption, environmental pollution, and economic benefits associated with production activities along global supply chains for 141 countries or regions and their sectors. Assuming there are m  countries and n  sectors for each country, the direct input coefficient matrix A = a ij od     can be derived from eq. (1) :(1) a ij od  = z ij od  x j d      where a ij od    represents the inputs from sector i  in country o  (origin country) required by one unit of the total output of sector j  in country d  (destination country). z ij od    denotes the intermediate monetary flows from sector i  in country o  to sector j  in country d , while x j d    denotes the total output in sector j  of country d . In this study, parameters Z   and x   are from the GTAP MRIO tables, while i , j  = 1, 2, …, n  (n  = 65) and o , d  = 1, 2, …, m  (m  = 141), respectively. Notations in lowercase, bold lowercase, and bold uppercase stand for elements, vectors, and matrices, respectively. To measure the sustainable impacts embodied in trade, we need to calculate the direct intensity coefficient h = h i o     for each indicator:(2) h i o  = s i o  x i o      where s i o    is the physical amount of each indicator (e.g., total economic benefit, resource consumption, or pollutant discharge) of sector i  in country o . The direct intensity coefficient h i o    represents the amount of economic benefit, resource consumption, or pollutant discharge to increase a unit of output of sector i  in country o . In this study, s   is from the EXIOBASE satellite account. Finally, using the Leontief inverse matrix (I  -A  )−1 , the entire virtual transfer matrix VT = vt i od     of each SDG indicator along the global supply chains can be calculated as follows:(3) vt = h ̂  ∙ I − A   − 1   ∙ Y ∙ i     where h ̂    is the diagonalizable h  . I   is the identity matrix. i   is a unit column vector with a magnitude of 1, providing only the direction information. Y = y i od     is the final demand matrix, of which the element means the volume of output of sector i  in country o  to satisfy the final demand in country d . In this study, matrix multiplication and element-wise multiplication are distinguished by symbols “·” and “×”, respectively. Using the equation h ̂  ∙ I − A   − 1   ∙ Y  , the virtual transfer (VT  ) from sector i  in country o  to country d  can be clearly traced. Furthermore, the total amount of all sectors and all destinations in each country vt   can be calculated by adding up the above virtual transfer matrix VT   by sectors and by destinations.  2.3 Inflation procedure To ensure the GTAP MRIO tables comparable over time, we need to eliminate the impacts of price changes caused by inflation. Referring to the approach used by the EXIOBASE technical documents (Wood et al., 2014 ), we calculated the annual price indices using the current-year-price and the previous-year-price WIOD database:(4) pi t t − 1   = x t t   x t t − 1        where x   (t , t ) and x   (t , t -1) denote the total output in year t  measured in the current-year price and the previous-year price in the WIOD database, respectively. pi   (t , t -1) is the annual price index showing the price change between the year t  and the previous year t -1. For the 43 countries or regions that are included in WIOD, the corresponding price indices can be calculated respectively. For other countries or regions, the price indices were approximately represented by the price indices of the “rest of the world (RoW)”. Then, we changed the annual price indices to chained price indices:(5) pi  t t − n   = pi  t t − 1   × pi  t − 1  t − 2   × ⋯ × pi  t − n + 1  t − n      which shows the price changes in year t  compared to year t -n . In this study, the base year was 2014 and the three previous GTAP MRIO tables were inflated to the price level of 2014 using the double deflation method (Wood et al., 2014 ).  2.4 Decomposition analysis The most widely used method to identify the effects of changes in trade patterns is to decompose changes in embodied transfer (e.g., pollutant discharge) into contributions of various driving factors, one of which is trade patterns usually denoted by export or import structure (e.g., Arto and Dietzenbacher, 2014 ; Meng et al., 2018 ; Perrier et al., 2019 ). Consequently, the impacts of changes in trade patterns can only be depicted as to what extent the changing patterns increase or decrease the pollutant discharge without a detailed exploration of the mechanism of why these changing patterns would have such impacts on sustainable development. Xu and Dietzenbacher (2014)  looked into the impacts of changes in trade patterns by decomposing the emissions embodied in trade to changes in trade patterns, production technology, total final demands, emission intensities and distinguishing the changes at home and abroad, but the range is only for CO2  emissions. To capture the impacts of changes in global trade patterns on multiple aspects of sustainable development, we followed the framework used in Jiang et al. (2018)  and conducted a simulation assuming that the pattern of share of imports from different countries (i.e. importing pattern) in year t 1 is replaced by the pattern in year t 2, with production technology, and intensity coefficient of each indicator unchanged. First, we decomposed the direct input coefficient A   matrix into technical matrix A  ⁎  and matrix of importing pattern of intermediate use C  . A ∗  = A ∗ 1    ⋯  A ∗ m     ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   A ∗ 1    ⋯  A ∗ m         with A ∗ d   = ∑ o = 1  m  A od    calculated by summing by sector all origin countries (o  = 1, 2, …, m ) of the direct input coefficient A   matrix for destination country d . There are n  rows in A  ⁎d  , indicating the amount of the intermediate inputs from each sector required by one unit of the total output in destination country d , irrespective of the exporting country. There are m A  ⁎d  s in one column of A  ⁎ , indicating the share of the intermediate inputs of each sector contributing to the destination country d  is the same in different origin countries o . While C = C 11   ⋯  C ∗ m     ⋮  ⋱  ⋮   C m 1    ⋯  C mm        with C od  = A od  A ∗ d      indicates the share of the intermediate inputs imported from each region irrespective of the exporting sector. There are n  rows in C  od  , indicating for each row sector, the proportion of intermediate inputs to destination country d  that comes from origin country o . There are m C  od  s in one column of C  , and the sum of the corresponding rows of different C  od  s is 1. Matrix A  ⁎  represents the share of intermediate inputs in each sector demanded by destination country d , while matrix C   represents the share of intermediate inputs from each origin country o . For more detailed information, please see Jiang et al. (2018) . Meanwhile, the trade pattern changes affect not only input structures in intermediate products but also in final products. Similarly, final demand F   can be decomposed into the stacked final demand Y  ⁎  and the importing pattern of final demand F  . Thus, eq. (3)  can be written as:(6) vt = h ̂  ∙ I − C × A ∗    − 1   ∙ F × Y ∗    ∙ i     To simplify the expression and make the decomposition process clear, the superscripts and subscripts indicating region and sector were not displayed in eq. (6) . Then, through eq. (7) , we can calculate the virtual transfer of each indicator in year t 1 under the baseline scenario that the trade pattern (C  , F  ), production technique (A  ⁎ , Y  ⁎ ), and intensity coefficient (h  ) are all in year t 1:(7) vt t 1  t 1   = h t 1   ̂  ∙ I − C t 1   × A t 1  ∗    − 1   ∙ F t 1   × Y t 1  ∗    ∙ i    where vt t 1  t 1     represents virtual transfer in t 1 with t 1's trade pattern. Meanwhile, through eq. (8) , we can also calculate the virtual transfer of each indicator in year t 1 under the simulation scenario that the trade pattern is replaced by the pattern in year t 2 with production scale, production technique, and intensity coefficient remaining unchanged:(8) vt t 1  t 2   = h t 1   ̂  ∙ I − C t 2   × A t 1  ∗    − 1   ∙ F t 2   × Y t 1  ∗    ∙ i    where vt t 1  t 2     represents virtual transfer in t 1 with t 2's trade pattern. The changing rate of an indicator caused by structural change in global trade between the time period t 1 and t 2 can be expressed as:(9) cr t 1 ∼ t 2   = vt t 1  t 2   + vt t 2  t 2     / 2 − vt t 1  t 1   + vt t 2  t 1     / 2  vt t 1  t 1   + vt t 2  t 1     / 2      where vt t 1  t 2   + vt t 2  t 2     / 2   denotes the virtual transfer under the t 2's trade pattern and the average level of other factors from t 1 to t 2, while vt t 1  t 1   + vt t 2  t 1     / 2   denotes the virtual transfer under t 1's trade pattern and the average level of other factors from t 1 to t 2. And cr  t 1∼t 2  indicates the changing rate of an indicator triggered by the replacement of the trade patterns from t 1 to t 2, based on the average economic development level (production scale, production technique, and intensity coefficient) of the period t 1 to t 2. In this study, we calculated cr  2004∼2007 , cr  2007∼2011 , and cr  2011∼2014 , respectively. We measured the effects of changes in global trade patterns in the three time periods instead of a whole ten-year (2004–2014) period because: first, the global financial crisis in 2008 had a huge impact on global trade patterns, and the global trade patterns have changed markedly before, during, and after the global financial crisis; second, the production technology and geographical specialization along the global supply chain have considerably changed during this decade, the approach we follow could lead to inconsistent results over longer time periods which we are able to avoid with this more detailed step-wise analysis.  2.5 Data The MRIO tables were acquired from GTAP version 10 (Aguiar et al., 2019 ). We chose the GTAP MRIO tables in 2004, 2007, 2011, and 2014 because the three time periods composed by these four years represent the financial-crisis era and the two periods before and after it. The most popular global MRIO tables include WIOD, Eora, EXIOBASE, and GTAP (Tukker and Dietzenbacher, 2013 ). Given that the GTAP database has a detailed country category (140 countries or regions, and one RoW”) with the sectoral classification consistent for different countries, we selected the GTAP database instead of other global MRIO tables, see comparison table in Table A.2  of Appendix. The 141 economies were further divided into a high-income group (56 economies), an upper-middle-income group (31 economies), a lower-middle-income group (37 economies), and a low-income group (17 economies). Income groups are classified according to the World Bank Analytical Classifications in 2014 (World Bank (WB), 2020 ). However, the satellite data of GTAP is limited, only including data about air pollutions, land use, energy volumes, and migration, while satellite data of EXIOBASE covers many fields that the UN SDGs focus on (see comparison table in Table A.3  of Appendix). In this regard, we obtained satellite data from the EXIOBASE account version 3.4 (Stadler et al., 2018 ). The country and sector classifications are diverse in different data sources, thus we adjusted them in accordance with the classifications of GTAP MRIO tables. To ensure monetary value comparable between different years, the price indices were calculated based on the current-year-price WIOD database and the previous-year-price WIOD database (Timmer et al., 2015 ). For detailed information about the harmonization of country category and sector category among different global MRIO databases and the country list in each income group, please see Supplemental Data.   3 Results 3.1 Impacts on SDG indicators at global level SDG indicators related to natural resource consumption and environmental pollution were significantly affected by changes in global trade patterns, while socio-economic SDG indicators were less affected. From 2004 to 2014, changes in global trade patterns have hardly affected global economic development, with all three economic indicators in each time period changing less than 1 % (Fig. 1 a ). In comparison, other dimensions of sustainable development associated with natural resource consumption and environmental pollution, were profoundly affected by changes in global trade patterns (Fig. 1 a). In the period 2004–2007, changes in global trade patterns increased pollution discharge and resource utilization globally, especially water pollution (increased by 12 %) and water consumption (increased by 10 %). In the period 2007–2011, fossil fuel consumption (Ind 5), GHG emissions (Ind 11), and forest area loss (Ind 12) decreased by 4 %, 1 %, and 4 % respectively, which were accompanied by a decline in employment (decreased by 2 %) and an increase in water consumption (increased by 17 %). In the period 2011–2014, most SDG indicators changed only slightly, less than 3 %, except for the substantially increased fossil fuel consumption (increased by 13 %) and decreased water consumption (decreased by 5 %). Generally, the amount of SDG indicators with higher percentage changes (> 3 %) declined from eight (in the period 2004–2007) to four (in the period 2007–2011) to three (in the period 2011–2014), whereas the amount of SDG indicators with lower percentage changes (≤ 3 %) increased (Fig. 1 b), indicating that the impacts of changes in global trade patterns on SDG indicators decreased from 2004 to 2014.  3.2 Impacts on SDG indicators among different income groups Changes in global trade patterns exacerbated inequality among income groups. The detrimental impacts triggered by changes in global trade patterns, represented by the size of bubbles in Fig. 2  , were concentrated in high-, upper-middle-, and lower-middle-income countries during the period 2004–2007 (Fig. 2 a). This pattern shifted towards low-income countries in the period 2007–2011 (Fig. 2 b), with some negative impacts (e.g., water pollution and blue water consumption) persisting in upper-middle- and lower-middle-income countries. By the period 2011–2014 (Fig. 2 c), the concentration of negative impacts had shifted primarily to lower-middle- and low-income countries. During the period 2004–2007, under the influence of changes in global trade patterns, forest area loss and blue water consumption in high-income countries increased by 11.35 % and 9.88 %, respectively. Mineral resource use, PM emissions, and blue water withdrawal in upper-middle-income countries increased by 11.27 %, 10.92 %, and 10.09 %, respectively. Meanwhile, water pollution, GHG emissions, and blue water consumption in lower-middle-income countries increased by 42.94 %, 25.45 %, and 15.04 %, respectively. In the period 2007–2011, blue water consumption and water pollution in upper-middle-income countries increased by 35.84 % and 13.42 %, respectively. Blue water consumption increased by 16.52 % in lower-middle-income countries, while fossil fuel consumption, mineral resource use, and CO2  emission in low-income countries increased by 102.32 %, 21.49 %, and 20.34 %, respectively. Finally, in the period 2011–2014, fossil fuel consumption, GHG emissions, and water pollution in lower-middle-income countries increased by 68.42 %, 19.52 %, and 10.09 %, respectively. Mineral resource use, PM emissions, and blue water withdrawal in low-income countries increased by 38.06 %, 36.00 %, and 25.16 %, respectively. If we further investigate the amount of change in SDG indicators negatively affected by changes in global trade patterns, focusing on those with percentage changes greater than 5 % (Fig. 2 d), we observe a distinct trend. The number of such indicators for high- and upper-middle-income countries decreased from eight to three to one across the three time periods. Conversely, the number of indicators for lower-middle- and low-income countries increased from five to nine to fourteen. For high-income countries, out of a total of 39 data points representing percentage changes across 13 SDG indicators over the three time periods, most (31 data points) were within ±3 %. Only five data points exhibited percentage changes larger than ±5 % (Fig. 2 a, b, c). This suggests that the sustainable development of high-income countries was not significantly sensitive to changes in global trade patterns. Furthermore, for all four income levels, percentage changes in all three economic indicators (Ind 6, Ind 9, Ind 13) across the three time periods remained largely within ±3 %. These changes are considerably smaller compared to percentage changes in other indicators, further confirming our earlier finding that the impacts of changes in global trade patterns on the global economy were minimal.  3.3 Impacts on decoupling of environment and economy among different income groups Sustained global economic growth relies on excessive resource consumption and has generated numerous environmental problems such as accelerated climate heating (Schandl et al., 2016 ). Decoupling economic growth from environmental pressure, as well as from social damage has been widely accepted as a necessity to achieve long-term sustainable development (Schandl et al., 2016 ; García-Alaminos et al., 2020 ) and has been proposed in SDG 8. Relative decoupling refers to resource and environmental impacts growing slower relative to the growth of value added (area I in Fig. 3  ) or reducing faster relative to the decline of value added (area III). Absolute decoupling, on the other hand, refers to a decline of resource and environmental impacts as value-added grows (area II). Conversely, rising resource and environmental impacts relative to value added indicate relative coupling, regardless of whether value added is rising (area VI) or falling (area IV). Finally, rising resource and environmental impacts relative to declining value added indicates absolute coupling (area V). From a dynamic perspective, a path for an income group that starts in the upper-left areas (IV, V, VI) and ends in the bottom-right areas (I, II, III) indicates a transition from coupling to decoupling of economic growth and sustainability. Similarly, a path that begins in area V and ends in either area IV or area VI reflects a transition from absolute coupling to relative coupling. Conversely, a path that starts in area I or area III and ends in area II suggests a transition from relative decoupling to absolute decoupling. These three paths illustrate a trade pattern that either reduces coupling or strengthens decoupling. As shown in Fig. 4  , for high-income countries, changes in global trade patterns resulted in a transition from coupling to decoupling of value added from water pollution (Ind 2), water consumption (Ind 3), CO2  emissions (Ind 8), and forest area loss (Ind 12). For upper-middle-income countries, changes in global trade patterns strengthened decoupling of value added from water consumption (Ind 3), reduced coupling to some extent for CO2  emissions (Ind 8), PM emissions (Ind 10), and GHG emissions (Ind 11), and also led to a transition from coupling to decoupling of value added from water pollution (Ind 2) and fossil fuel consumption (Ind 5). However, decoupling of value added from forest area loss (Ind 12) weakened. For lower-middle-income countries, changes in global trade patterns reduced coupling of value added with water pollution (Ind 2), water consumption (Ind 3), water withdrawal (Ind 4), and fossil fuel consumption (Ind 5), as well as GHG emissions (Ind 11). Additionally, there was a transition from coupling to decoupling of value added from mineral resource use (Ind 7) and PM emissions (Ind 10), but a transition from decoupling to coupling occurred for CO2  emissions (Ind 8) and forest area loss (Ind 12). For low-income countries, changes in global trade patterns reduced coupling of value added with mineral resource use (Ind 7). However, these changes also led to a transition from decoupling to coupling of value added with water pollution (Ind 2), water consumption (Ind 3), water withdrawal (Ind 4), fossil fuel consumption (Ind 5), CO2  emissions (Ind 8), PM emissions (Ind 10), GHG emissions (Ind 11), and forest area loss (Ind 12). In summary, changes in global trade patterns promoted decoupling of value added from most SDG indicators for higher-income countries, but resulted in coupling of value added with most SDG indicators for low-income countries.  3.4 Impacts on decoupling of environment and economy for specific countries We further explore the decoupling and coupling effects triggered by changes in global trade patterns on individual countries. Taking the period 2011–2014 and seven economies as an example (see Fig. 5  ), for high-income countries, changes in global trade patterns resulted in a decoupling of blue water withdrawal (Ind 4) from value added in the EU27, the US, and Russia, and a decoupling of forest area loss (Ind 12) in the US and Russia. For upper-middle-income countries, changes in global trade patterns from 2011 to 2014 led to a coupling of CO2  emission (Ind 8) with value added in China, Brazil, and South Africa, while resulting in a decoupling of blue water consumption (Ind 3), PM emissions (Ind 10), and GHG emissions (Ind 11) from value added in Brazil and China. For India, a lower-middle-income country, changes in global trade patterns led to a decoupling of mineral resource use (Ind 7) and PM emissions (Ind 10) from value added, but to a coupling of blue water consumption (Ind 3), blue water withdrawal (Ind 4), total fossil fuel consumption (Ind 5), CO2  emission (Ind 8), and GHG emissions (Ind 11) with value added. This logic can likewise be used to analyze the decoupling impacts of changes in global trade patterns on any SDG indicator, country, and time period (see impacts on more individual countries at different income levels in Fig. A.2 —Fig. A.5  of Appendix). Additionally, Fig. A.1  (see Appendix) shows the amount of countries at different levels of income affected by decoupling and coupling related to all natural resources and environmental pollution indicators in the three time periods.   4 Discussion and conclusions While the number of indicators is limited to some extent, given that there are 17 SDGs and over one hundred targets announced by the United Nations, and the used indicators may not represent every single development requirement of the SDGs, this set of indicators is the most detailed one currently used for the analysis of trade impacts. This is because many other SDGs are more affected by policies in areas like health care and education, and are less directly impacted by trade. Although an increasing number of databases are available for sustainable development-related research, e.g. Warchold et al. (2022) , the data provided remains at the country level, lacking sector-specific information relevant to this analysis. Improving the availability of comparable data of a wide range of indicators, encompassing both countries and industries, can provide a foundation for future SDG-related scientific research. Moreover, the choice of the MRIO database and the process of calculation may lead to uncertainty in results. There is inherent variability in results when using different MRIO databases, including sets of MRIO tables and satellite data, because source data, construction techniques, and conceptual scopes differ across multiple MRIO databases (Moran and Wood, 2014 ; Owen, 2017 ; Wood et al., 2018 ). Specifically, in this study, the MRIO tables were sourced from GTAP, while satellite data for SDG indicators were sourced from the EXIOBASE account. This was done to leverage the detailed regional and sectoral classifications available in GTAP and the comprehensive indicator classification in EXIOBASE. To reconcile the regional and sectoral classifications of the EXIOBASE satellite account with those of GTAP, the process of aggregation and disaggregation in region and sector of the satellite may further contribute to uncertainty. Similarly, the calculation process of price indices and constant-price MRIO tables may also introduce uncertainty due to the regional and sectoral reconciliation. Additionally, the use of multiple data sources makes it less timely to extend the study period. Extending the study period would require all the data sources used in this study to be updated, ensuring that the statistics calibers are consistent with their respective previous versions. Alternatively, one could consider fitting and forecasting the data based on the existing dataset, but this would introduce further uncertainty. We note that GTAP version 11 has been updated to 2017, but WIOD, the data source for price indices, has not been updated to the same extent. EXIOBASE, the source of satellite data, is updated in different calibers based on estimation. Our study goes beyond the literature that hitherto has mainly focused on one specific issue. Most research investigating the relationship between economic development and the environment tends to examine a single issue, then draw conclusions such as “GHG emissions have decoupled from economic growth for a certain period.” Our study demonstrates that this picture becomes less clear-cut when considering multiple issues simultaneously over longer time periods. In this study, we proposed a framework quantifying the impacts of changes in global trade patterns on SDG indicators at both global and country levels for three time periods. This framework contributes to the existing research in the following aspects: 1) existing research lacks a comprehensive analysis that covers all sustainable elements and their integration (Fuso Nerini et al., 2018 ). Our study considers multiple indicators referring to the three sustainable dimensions, corresponding to 12 goals and 14 targets, which is the most exhaustive research on the impacts of changes in trade patterns on globally sustainable development so far. 2) Current research on SDGs lacks information for developing countries and the least developed countries. Our study has a global coverage including 141 countries or regions. 3) Existing research on evaluating the impacts of changes in global trade patterns on sustainable development tends to calculate the share of contribution of each driving factor and lacks an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of these impacts. Our approach is able to quantify the contribution of changes in trade patterns on multiple SDG indicators and the degree of decoupling between value added and those indicators. Our analysis shows that while the impacts of changes in global trade patterns decreased for most SDG indicators between 2004 and 2014, results also show significant differences for different indicators and countries at different income levels. Specifically, 1) SDG indicators related to natural resource consumption and environmental pollution were significantly affected by changes in global trade patterns, while socio-economic SDG indicators were less affected. 2) Changes in global trade patterns lead to an unequal distribution of gains and costs of trade. The amount of SDG indicators significantly and negatively affected by changes in trade decreased in high- and upper-middle-income countries but increased in lower-middle- and low-income countries. 3) Trade does not lead automatically to optimal outcomes related to sustainable development goals, especially when taking the environment into account. Changes in global trade patterns led to a decoupling of value added from most SDG indicators for higher income countries but resulted in a coupling for low-income countries. Our study is able to quantify the differential impacts of changes in global trade patterns of a recent time period on countries, and thus, be instructive and guide future interventions for improving the fairness of trade and inform cooperation between countries in the future in terms of sustainable development. This could be the first step for countries to improve trade policy. Because trade flows are influenced by trade treaties, path dependencies of past trade relations, relative prices, power, and underpriced environmental resources, trade patterns are more than territorial management within the influence sphere of policymakers but an issue of global cooperation. Therefore, 1) it is necessary to improve the understanding of shared responsibility towards achieving the SDGs, especially for higher income countries. The high levels of sustainability of higher income countries are due to not only their advanced production and pollution control technologies but also the benefits of outsourcing resource-intensive productions to lower income countries with lower production costs. However, our study shows that the economic and social benefits that lower income countries have gained are not enough to offset the negative impacts on resources and the environment. Thus, strengthening the awareness of shared responsibility among high-income countries and encouraging them to share advanced technology and equipment is conducive to improving the fairness of trade-related sustainable development. 2) Policies that influence import (e.g. border tax adjustment) as well as vertical supply chain management could be helpful tools in achieving a country's environmental and social goals. Considering the value attributes of tax policies, tax or subsidy policies can assign economic value to resources and the environment. Economic gains in comparable volume can compensate for the losses in resources and environment, thereby accelerating the decoupling of economic development from resource and environmental burdens in lower income countries. This study assessed the differential impacts of changes in global trade patterns across countries rather than explaining reasons for changes in global trade patterns. Future studies can delve deeper into how global trade patterns have shifted, specifically elucidating the changes in each country's role within global supply chains to analyze the underlying reasons for trade patterns affecting sustainable development. Future studies could also conduct uncertainty analysis on a specific region or SDG indicator based on different data sources and various data reconciliation approaches.
