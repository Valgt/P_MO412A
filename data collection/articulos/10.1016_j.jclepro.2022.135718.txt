                  Sustainability has become a key corporate strategy inspiring companies to implement the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in accordance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development proposed by the UN. Although studies do examine the SDG priorities, to our knowledge, the main factors that influence the prioritisation of the SDG remain hazy. We identify the SDG priorities in the automotive industry worldwide and from the point of view of the geographic, cultural, social, and economic specifics of the countries in which these companies operate. The automotive industry is a good subject of analyses because it is a pillar of the global economy and a main driver of macroeconomic growth, stability, and technological prosperity. We accordingly employ frequency analysis and the PROMETHEE multi-criteria decision-making method. The PROMETHEE method not only prioritises researched groups, but also the dependencies between the evaluating criteria and profiles of the groups’ performance. Frequency analysis showed that SDG 8 ’Decent work and economic growth’ was adopted by 81% of companies, followed by 3 ’Good health and well-being’, 5 ’Gender equality’, 12 ’Responsible consumption and production’, 13 ’Climate action’, and 4 ’Quality education’, which had similar frequencies. Overall, these six SDGs were adopted by at least 66% of companies. However, the PROMETHEE analysis confirms that SDG priorities are highly dependent on the continent and country’s basic economic performance. Companies from developed Asian economies and developing African economies have significantly different SDG priorities than the rest of the world. We also identified similarities between the developing American and developed European economies, the developing economies of America and Asia, the developed economies of America and Europe, and developing Asian and developed European economies. These findings may be particularly important for practice (managers, professional associations, investors, shareholders, and other stakeholders) and policy (policymakers, regulatory bodies, and sustainability initiatives).

Handling Editor: Weidong Li Sustainability has become a key corporate strategy inspiring companies to implement the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in accordance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development proposed by the UN. Although studies do examine the SDG priorities, to our knowledge, the main factors that influence the prioritisation of the SDG remain hazy. We identify the SDG priorities in the automotive industry worldwide and from the point of view of the geographic, cultural, social, and economic specifics of the countries in which these companies operate. The automotive industry is a good subject of analyses because it is a pillar of the global economy and a main driver of macroeconomic growth, stability, and technological prosperity. We accordingly employ frequency analysis and the PROMETHEE multi-criteria decision-making method. The PROMETHEE method not only prioritises researched groups, but also the dependencies between the evaluating criteria and profiles of the groups’ performance. Frequency analysis showed that SDG 8 ’Decent work and economic growth’ was adopted by 81% of companies, followed by 3 ’Good health and well-being’, 5 ’Gender equality’, 12 ’Responsible consumption and production’, 13 ’Climate action’, and 4 ’Quality education’, which had similar frequencies. Overall, these six SDGs were adopted by at least 66% of companies. However, the PROMETHEE analysis confirms that SDG priorities are highly dependent on the continent and country’s basic economic performance. Companies from developed Asian economies and developing African economies have significantly different SDG priorities than the rest of the world. We also identified similarities between the developing American and developed European economies, the developing economies of America and Asia, the developed economies of America and Europe, and developing Asian and developed European economies. These findings may be particularly important for practice (managers, professional associations, investors, shareholders, and other stakeholders) and policy (policymakers, regulatory bodies, and sustainability initiatives).

The report introduced three fundamental sustainable dimensions: economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality. This approach was further developed by Elkington (1998)  through the triple bottom line, which equally prioritises all three dimensions of sustainability to create an integrative theory of sustainability (Das, 2017 ). In the present study, however, we shift from this macroeconomic perspective and apply the microeconomic view and definition of Sikdar (2003) : ‘Sustainability is a wise balance between economic development, environmental stewardship, and social equity’. Sustainable development is a key industry strategy and companies regularly publish the implementation of such strategies in sustainability, corporate social responsibility or non-financial reports. They define their key areas of sustainable development, strategic goals, and activities, and an evaluation of their fulfilment. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the UN (UN Global Compact, 2021b ) is an especially important reference to build these strategies. The key element of the agenda is a group of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were expected to be adopted by all member states of the UN in 2015. The SDGs are an urgent call for global partnership in action to combine poverty alleviation and economic growth through improving education, health, social protection, and job opportunities within the context of climate change and environmental protection (United Nations, 2022a ). All SDGs are related, so action in one area is expected to affect outcomes in others. This inspires development that balances social, economic, and environmental sustainability. The SDGs comprise 17 lofty goals (UN Global Compact, 2021a ): (1) ‘No poverty’, (2) ‘Zero hunger’, (3) ‘Good health and well-being’, (4) ‘Quality education’, (5) ‘Gender equality’, (6) ‘Clean water and sanitation’, (7) ‘Affordable and clean energy’, (8) ‘Decent work and economic growth’, (9) ‘Industry, innovation and infrastructure’, (10) ‘Reduced inequalities’, (11) ‘Sustainable cities and communities’, (12) ‘Responsible consumption and production’, (13) ‘Climate action’, (14) ‘Life below water’, (15) ‘Life on land’, (16) ‘Peace, justice and strong institutions’, and (17) ‘Partnerships for the goals’. These are further specified into 169 targets and 231 unique indicators (United Nations, 2017 ). Although the SDGs are not legally binding, countries are expected to take ownership and establish a national framework to achieve them through their own sustainable development policies, plans, and programmes. They require resource mobilisation and financing strategies. Thus, successful implementation of the SDGs depends on multi-stakeholder partnerships containing governments, municipalities, public organisations, NGOs, academic, companies, business associations, and other stakeholders (United Nations, 2020 ). Businesses worldwide should play an important role in the advancement of the 2030 Agenda and implementation of SDGs (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). Awareness of SDGs is constantly increasing not only among companies, but especially among their stakeholders (Yamane and Kaneko, 2021 ). Not all 17 SDGs will be equally relevant for a company. Many factors influence the extent to which a company can contribute to each goal and the risks and opportunities each goal represents (SDG Compass, 2017 ). A literature review (see Section 2 ) helps us identify the research gaps in studies on SDG prioritisation in the business sphere: • There are many internal and external factors that influence SDG reporting. However, this influence has so far been examined from the perspective of SDG adoption (whether companies have adopted the SDGs).  • No consistent approach or pattern to SDG prioritisation in business practice was identified.  • Studies on SDG prioritisation focussed only on the overall priorities of SDGs from the perspective of the whole world, the selected region, or country.  • So far, no detailed research has been conducted on the main factors that influence the prioritisation of the SDGs in business practice, such as the geographic, cultural, social, or economic specifics of the countries in which companies operate.    In our study, we focus on the automotive industry because it is a pillar of the global economy and a main driver of macroeconomic growth, stability, and technological prosperity. It creates economic development, generates government revenues, fosters R&D, and encourages people development. It is one of the largest industries in the world, with an estimated USD 2.8 trillion of global commercial activity in 2022 (Statista, 2022 ). It includes not only major car manufacturers but a variety of companies whose principal business is in the manufacturing, design, or marketing of automotive parts or vehicles. The automotive industry has also an important multiplier effect in the overall economy, as it is important for upstream industries (such as mining, steel, fuel, chemicals, and electronics) as well as downstream industries (such as ICT, finance and insurance, repair, and mobility services). It is also one of the world’s largest investors in R&D, with an annual spend of over EUR 120 billion (ACEA, 2022 ). According to European Commission (2021), the automotive industry is crucial for European prosperity, representing 6.1% of total EU employment and more than 7% of EU GDP. The main goal of our study is to identify the SDGs that the automotive industry considers the most important or, conversely, the least important, for global sustainable development. We thus investigate the following research questions: • What are the SDG priorities in the automotive industry and to what extent are the results of our research in line with the studies already conducted? We compare our results with the findings established in seven critical studies identified through a literature review.  • Are there patterns (similarities and differences) in SDG prioritisation from the point of view of geographic, cultural, social, or economic specifics of the countries in which companies operate? We examine these patterns in terms of both the selected goals and their number.    To answer the second research question, we investigate whether and how priorities differ in terms of the following two factors: (1) the continent in which the company’s headquarter is located, namely, Africa, America, Asia, and Europe, which is assumed to affect the preferences for the SDG owing to the regional heterogeneity in geographical, cultural, and social factors; and (2) basic economic performance of the country in which the company’s headquarter is located, that is, the present situation in the overall economy of a country. We use the classification of countries according to the UN, namely, developing, transforming, and developed economies (United Nations, 2022b ). The classification is based on economic status, industrialisation, and standard of living. Again, it can be assumed that SDG preferences will reflect the different economic conditions under which companies operate. Both views simplify the situation significantly because the selected continents include countries with different basic economic performance and vice versa. For this reason, we pay special attention to providing and identifying differences in priorities from a combination of both perspectives. We also consider our problem to be indicative of a problem of multi-criteria evaluation, which inspires us to use the multi-criteria decision-making method. We thus adopt the PROMETHEE ranking method for its universality and high traceability, and ability to accomplish complementary analysis. This allows us to explore the dependencies between criteria and alternatives and performance profiles of the alternatives. Our study is novel because it explores the influence of the two factors above on SDG prioritisation at a global scale. We specifically build on two conference papers that present partial results of a two-year investigation (Lenort and Zapletal, 2020; Zapletal et al., 2021 ). To the best of our knowledge, no other study has made such forays. We accordingly offer interesting implications for practice and policy. The remaining study is organised as follows. Section 2  presents the literature review and novelty of the research questions; Section 3  presents the mathematical foundation of the PROMETHEE ranking method and related analyses; Section 4  describes the input data and structures; Section 5  summarises the results; Section 6  discusses the results and offers implications for practice and policy; and, finally, Section 7  concludes.  2 Literature review The SDGs are directed at governments and other actors in society, but both academia and professionals recognise the importance of businesses (Mio et al., 2020; Pizzi et al., 2020 ). While governments are the key actors in driving the SDGs, business is an important stakeholder owing to its resources, ability to innovate, and scale and reach (Agarwal et al., 2017 ). It plays a key role in the provision of products and services that are needed today and will be needed in future; thus, it is the cornerstone of economic investment, job creation, and a multitude of other important aspects of sustainable development (Sullivan et al., 2018 ). The SDGs are also one of the most important drivers of companies in developing business models for sustainability (Rauter et al., 2017 ). SDGs allow companies to select and prioritise corporate sustainability issues and also align strategies towards specific or relevant sustainability goals (Calabrese et al., 2021; Gómez-Bezares et al., 2017 ). SDGs can be the catalyst for innovation and new products. They serve as a powerful recruitment tool for a new generation of employees whose values align with the goals and who can build trust with a wide range of stakeholders (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2019 ). The adoption of the SDGs in company strategies and sustainable reporting is influenced by a large number of internal and external factors. These factors have been identified and analysed in several studies, which are summarised in Table 1 .   Rosati and Faria (2019b)  investigated the relationship between seven internal factors and early adoption of SDG reporting to identify the companies that addressed the SDGs in their sustainability reports. They found that early adoption of SDG reporting is related to larger size, higher level of intangible assets, higher commitment to sustainability frameworks and external assurance, higher share of female directors, and younger board of directors. The follow-up study of Kazemikhasragh et al. (2021)  analysed the influence of the same internal factors on the adoption of SDGs in large companies in low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa. They also explored new internal factors such as company age, number of external advisors, company’s status, number of publications, and sectors to which the companies belong. They demonstrated that economic performance, presence of women and younger directors in the company’s management structure, company’s age, number of publications, and sector significantly influenced SDG adoption. Pizzi et al. (2021)  investigated 14 internal factors grouped into three categories. Based on a sample of Italian companies, they showed a positive relationship between SDG reporting and the presence of independent directors on the board, expertise with non-financial reporting, and length of the report. The highest levels of SDG reporting were achieved by companies operating in environmental sensitive sectors. Martínez-Ferrero and García-Meca (2020)  explored the strength of internal corporate governance as a determining factor in a company’s bid to address the SDGs. Using a European sample of analysis, they examined CEO independence, board composition, and board attendance as internal corporate governance factors that affect a company’s commitment to sustainable development and increase the propensity to report SDGs in the sustainability reports.  Rosati and Faria (2019a)  conducted a comprehensive worldwide analysis of external factors. Their research was undertaken by considering 27 country-specific institutional factors belonging to six different national institutional systems. The results show that companies reporting on the SDGs are more likely in countries with higher levels of climate change vulnerability, national corporate social responsibility, company spending on tertiary education, indulgence, and individualism, but lower levels of market coordination, employment protection, power distance, and long-term orientation. Bose and Khan (2022)  argued for the importance of other country-level factors than those investigated by Rosati and Faria (2019a) . They analysed sustainability regulation, SDGs performance score, and nature of corporate governance models, finding that SDG reporting differs for companies in countries with sustainability regulation and better SDGs performance ratings. Furthermore, companies in developing countries did higher company-level SDGs reporting than those in developed countries, while companies in shareholder-oriented countries than stakeholder-oriented countries had higher SDG reporting. Both internal and external factors addressing SDG adoption and reporting feature in the literature. van der Waal and Thijssens (2020)  analysed five factors in their worldwide study and found that company involvement in the SDGs is mainly associated with commitment to sustainability-related initiatives, country settings, company size, and company sustainability level. However, the commitment to sustainability-related initiatives is the only factor that was highly and consistently significant. Elalfy et al. (2021)  also analysed five factors that influence the adoption of the SDGs by companies around the world. They confirmed that larger companies, publicly listed companies, companies from industries with higher sustainability impact, and companies that follow international sustainability guidelines and standards are more likely to address the SDGs in their reporting. They also confirmed a regional effect regarding SDG reporting. van Zanten and van Tulder (2018)  conducted explanatory research of four factors on a sample of European and North American companies. The survey indicates that companies engage more with SDGs that are actionable within their operations than those outside of it, and more with SDGs that ‘avoid harm’ than those that ‘do good’. They also explored differences in SDG engagement based on companies’ home- and host-countries and their industrial sectors. de Oliveira Claro and Esteves (2021)  conducted a questionnaire survey in companies doing business in Brazil to identify factors that motivate these companies to adopt SDGs. The main factor identified was existence of a strategic plan that integrates the SDGs and future-desired image and reputation on sustainability. While all SDGs are considered equally important by the UN, it is up to individual companies to interpret and prioritise their implementation (Ike et al., 2019 ). Agarwal et al. (2017)  argued that meaningful engagement by business with the SDGs should begin with identifying the most impactful SDGs—whether positive or negative. Prioritisation of the SDGs should be based on a transparent, robust analysis, and inclusive consultations (Mhlanga et al., 2018 ), as each sector has different specifics and challenges (Zimon et al., 2020 ). The goals are not of equal relevance not only from the point of view of the sector but also of each company or geography (KPMG, 2018 ). Companies engage more with SDGs that are actionable within their operations than outside of it (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018 ). According to UN Global Compact (2021b) , all SDGs can be divided into three groups depending on how business practice can affect them: (1) ‘Lead and shape’, (2) ‘Cooperate with others’, and (3) ‘Follow and amplify’. While most companies prioritised a subset of SDGs, the prioritisation processes appeared to have significant gaps in terms of consistency, justification, and breadth not only in terms of business as a whole, but also individual sectors (Mhlanga et al., 2018 ). The business adopts different SDG prioritisation strategies. Some companies prefer to concentrate on a limited number of SDGs, while others try to engage with most of the goals (Calabrese et al., 2021 ). Generally, it is difficult to find a clear pattern in terms of the number of SDGs companies choose to prioritise (KPMG, 2018 ). There are several studies researching SDG in business practice. Mhlanga et al. (2018)  reviewed a sample of 76 global companies across a set of eight industry sectors. KPMG (2018)  investigated the world’s 250 largest companies across all sectors. PricewaterhouseCoopers (2019)  reviewed the largest sample of 1141 companies from 31 countries across seven industry sectors. Ali et al. (2018)  focussed on the adoption and implementation of SDGs in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—emerging economies with large population and abundant resources. The research included 25 top multinational companies (five from each country). Izzo et al. (2020b)  analysed a sample of 134 European companies from the International Integrated Reporting Council list, which published an integrated report in 2018. Similarly, Yu et al. (2020)  investigated sample of 100 Chinese companies that are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2018. Finally, Izzo et al. (2020a)  focussed on a sample of 40 biggest Italian listed companies from different sectors (see Table 3  for the findings of these studies).  3 PROMETHEE methodology When dealing with a multi-criteria decision-making problem, many different methods can be applied. They are based on different principles, such as establishing the utility function (for weighted sum approach, see Figueira et al. (2005) ; for analytic hierarchy process, see Saaty (2004) ), measuring the distances between criteria (for TOPSIS method, see Figueira et al. (2005) ), or outranking methods based on special binary evaluating relations (for ELECTRE Roy, 1990  or PROMETHEE, see Mareschal et al. (1984) ). Each method has merit and demerits. Matching a method to a problem thus requires careful selection. In the present study, we seek to solve a problem with a flat structure of quantitative criteria; the weights of the criteria are not applicable, because there is no objective reason to assign a different importance to SDGs. We also explore the dependencies between both the criteria and the alternatives. For this purpose, the PROMETHEE provides a unique tool — the GAIA plane (geometrical analysis for interactive assistance), see Hayez et al. (2009) . There are several reasons why the PROMETHEE ranking method is a suitable choice for this study: (1) it does not require any special data type (it can handle both qualitative and quantitative data) or structure (as in the case of analytical hierarchy process  ). Furthermore, (2) the method is well traceable and computationally easy (Ishizaka and Nemery, 2013 ). (3) When leaving aside the weights of criteria (which are irrelevant in this study), no artificial subjective inputs are required from the decision maker (the only one special input is a preference function shape for each criterion, which is described later in this section, but this choice is driven by the datatype of a criterion) (Ishizaka and Nemery, 2013 ). (4) It is easy to determine how each particular criterion influences the final ranking of an alternative (the profiles of the alternatives can be easily derived). Finally, (5) the dependencies between pairs criteria and alternatives can be captured by the GAIA plane (Hayez et al., 2009 ). PROMETHEE was developed by Mareschal et al. (1984)  and has been applied to many fields of application since then (Behzadian et al., 2010 ). For this study, the basic PROMETHEE ranking algorithm (Mareschal et al., 1984 ) and the graphical tool called GAIA plane (see Hayez et al. (2009) ) are used. The ranking algorithms allow for the evaluation of alternatives. The GAIA plane captures the dependencies within the problem’s structure, which are useful for better understanding the modelled problem. Therefore, these algorithms and tools are briefly recalled in the rest of this section. Let us have a ranking problem where s   alternatives A   are to be evaluated based on k   criteria. First, the alternatives must be pair-wisely compared in terms of each criterion. A preference function P  i     assigned to each criterion is thus used. This preference function is chosen by a decision-maker and indicates the extent to which the performance of one alternative is preferred over the performance of another alternative regarding the criterion i   (this preference is quantified and expressed in [ 0 , 1 ]   ). The six predefined shapes of preference functions were first introduced by Mareschal et al. (1984) . By far, the most popular type for quantitative criteria is the linear one (see Behzadian et al. (2010)  and Fig. 1 ), which we use herein. The ranking of alternatives is done using the net flows (ϕ  ) of the alternatives, which can be calculated using (1) .  (1) ϕ ( A  t   )  = ∑  j = 1 , j ≠ t  s   ∑  i = 1  k   w  i   ⋅ P  i   ( v  i , t   − v  i , j   )   s − 1   − ∑  j = 1 , j ≠ t  s   ∑  i = 1  k   w  i   ⋅ P  i   ( v  i , j   − v  i , t   )   s − 1   ,      For all t  , where v  i , t     is the performance value of t  th alternative in terms of i  th criterion, w  i     is the weight of the i  th criterion.  The greater the net flow, the better the ranking of the given alternative. The graphical output GAIA is, unlike the PROMETHEE ranking, independent of the weights w  i     and works with the so-called unicriterion net flows ϕ  i  C   ( A  t   )    , for i = 1 , 2 , … , k   (2) .  (2) ϕ  i  C   ( A  t   )  = ∑  i ≠ t   ( P  i   ( v  i , t   − v  i , j   )  − P  i   ( v  i , j   − v  i , t   )   )   s − 1   , ∀ t      The relationship between the aggregated flow (1)  and unicriterion flow (2)  of an alternative is as follows: ϕ ( A  t   )  = ∑  i = 1  k   w  i   ⋅ ϕ  i  C   ( A  t   )    . Using the unicriterion flows, each alternative is represented by the point in k  -dimensional space [ ϕ  1  C   ( A  t   )  , ϕ  2  C   ( A  t   )  , … , ϕ  k  C   ( A  t   )  ]   , which is further projected onto a 2-D plane using principal component analysis (Hayez et al., 2009; Abdi and Williams, 2010 ). This projection is called the GAIA plane and consists of axes (representing k   criteria) and points (representing s   alternatives). As each projection usually brings the loss of information, it is necessary to check for quality (if the projection is not too distorted), see Brans and Mareschal (2005) . According to Mareschal et al. (2008) , the quality of the projection is good enough if it captures at least 80% of information. The following conclusions can be deduced from the plane: • If two alternatives are close to one another, they have a similar performance profile (i.e. they both tend to be good/bad in terms of the same (similar) set of criteria) and vice versa. For example, V  1     and V  2     in Fig. 2  have similar profiles and V  3     and V  4     have contradictory profiles.  • If two criteria are oriented in a similar direction, they express similar preferences (i.e. their preferences are positively correlated), and vice versa. For example, C  1     and C  2     in Fig. 2  are positively dependent, and C  3     and C  5     are negatively dependent.  • If two projected axes are orthogonal, the corresponding criteria are not mutually dependent (e.g. C  2     and C  5     in Fig. 2 ).  • The longer the projected axis, the stronger the distinguishing power the corresponding criterion has (i.e. the greater variability in the performance values of the alternatives) and vice versa. In Fig. 2 , C  1     has substantially greater distinguishing power for the given problem than C  3    .     Given that all criteria in the solved problem are quantitative with the same range from 0 to 1, the threshold values for the linear preference functions (see Fig. 1 ) are set accordingly: p = 0    and q = 1   . This will ensure that no criterion (i.e. SDG) is favoured over the others. For the same reason, the weights are set equal for all criteria.  4 Input data The input data for the article were taken from the UN Global Compact database (UN Global Compact, 2022 ). Founded in 2000, this non-binding UN group represents the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative (UN Global Compact, 2021a ). The database provides information and documents on the sustainability of more than 18,500 participants (companies and non-profit organisations) from 162 countries. The participants are divided into 20 sectors and 42 subsectors. We draw data from the Automobiles & Parts sector which contains 233 active participants. Each participant provides a Communication on Progress (COP) report to the database. This is an annual publication of information and documents through which participants inform their stakeholders about their efforts to implement the principles of the UN Global Compact (UN Global Compact, 2013 ). One part of the COP concerns the SDGs. Participants are expected to answer the following question: ‘Which SDGs are covered by the activities described in the COP?’. This way, companies declare which SDGs they fulfil through their activities. In the examined sector, 136 companies answered this question. These 136 companies represent the sample set for our research. The Cochran’s formula (Cochran, 1977 )—which is especially appropriate in situations with large populations—was used to determine the representativeness of the sample. The margin of error was ±  8.40% at a 95% level of confidence, making the sample sufficiently representative. The sample also contains both small and medium (23%) and large companies (77%). Companies from different levels of the automotive supply chain are represented. The sample also includes the leading automotive suppliers such as BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, KIA, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Renault, and Volvo. Among the leading automotive suppliers, we include Antolin, Bosch, Continental, Faurecia, Knorr-Bremse, Michelin, or Valeo. Binary values were obtained from the sample. A value of 1 means that the relevant SDG was marked by the participant; a value of 0 means that the SDG was not selected in the response. Each company was classified in terms of both factors examined, that is, the continent and the basic economic performance of the residential country. The input data represent the preferences declared by the companies themselves. However, real preferences, that is, the real activities of companies in the field of sustainability, do not necessarily have to coincide with the declared ones. This is an important distinction. The breakdown of the companies in terms of the continents in which they are located is as follows: 4 companies (2.94%) from Africa, 25 companies (18.38%) from America, 36 companies (26.47%) from Asia, 1 company (0.74%) from Australia, and 70 companies (51.47%) from Europe. As Australia is represented by only one company, the continent was excluded from further analysis. The division of companies in terms of the basic economic performance of the residential country is as follows: 49 companies (36.03%) from developing economies, 1 company (0.74%) from transforming economies, and 86 companies (63.23%) from developed economies. Given that the transforming economies are represented by only one company, the group was excluded from further analysis. The combination of both factors generates the following six alternatives of economies: • Developing African economies: 4 companies (2.99%).  • Developing American economies: 18 companies (13.43%).  • developed American economies: 7 companies (5.22%).  • Developing Asian economies: 27 companies (20.15%).  • Developed Asian economies: 9 companies (6.72%).  • Developed European economies: 69 companies (51.49%).    The established classification shows that developing African economies, developed American economies, and developed Asian economies have relatively low representation. This fact should be considered when interpreting the results. To obtain the performance values of individual alternatives, the arithmetic average of binary values was used, that is, the relative frequency r   with which companies included in a given alternative (group) contribute to the fulfilment of the given SDG (e.g. the value r = 0 . 5    means that half of the companies of the given alternative contribute to the SDG and the second half do not). In our opinion, the relative frequency of adoption of each particular SDG is a measure which is easy to understand and offers the first insight into the problem before the decision analysis is made. The resulting input data are shown in Table 2 .    5 Results To yield results, we analysed the obtained input data in two ways. First, we performed frequency analysis based on the relative frequency r   with which companies included in a given alternative contribute to the fulfilment of the given SDG. This analysis identified the SDGs which are highly preferred by companies worldwide and the assessed alternatives (companies from the given group contribute the most to their achievement) or, conversely, almost neglected. Second, through PROMETHEE analysis, we graphically explored both similarities and differences in the preferences to the considered alternatives (economies). 5.1 Results of SDG frequency analysis The frequency analysis revealed a preference for meeting SDG 8 ‘Decent work and economic growth’ (adopted by 81% of companies), followed by five other SDGs with very similar overall frequency (in descending order): 3 ‘Good health and well-being’, 5 ‘Gender equality’, 12 ‘Responsible consumption and production’, 13 ‘Climate action’, and 4 ‘Quality education’. These six SDGs were adopted by at least 66% of companies (see Fig. 3 ). On the contrary, 14 ‘Life below water’ and 2 ‘Zero hunger’ were adopted by at most 22% of companies, while SDG 1 ‘No poverty’ and 15 ‘Life on land’ were adopted by only 34% of companies. These SDGs were thus judged to be the least preferred. The rest of the SDGs were placed between the indicated extreme values, with overall frequency varying between 57% and 39%.  Table 3  compares our results with prior findings. SDG 8 ‘Decent work and economic growth’ is highly preferred across all studies (i.e. either the highest or the second highest priority). In most studies, 3 ‘Good health and well-being’, 12 ‘Responsible consumption and production’, and 13 ‘Climate action’ have very high priority, as in our study. However, they are not preferred in studies targeting developing countries (Ali et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2020 ). This supports the hypothesis that one of the main factors influencing the prioritisation of SDGs is the basic economic performance of the country. Izzo et al. (2020a)  also reported different results; however, they examined only a small sample of Italian companies and identified only three prioritised SDGs. In contrast, SDGs 5 ‘Gender Equality’ and 4 ‘Quality Education’, which were highly preferred by the automotive industry in our study, were only marginally preferred in other studies. SDG 9 ‘Industry, innovation and infrastructure’ was also a priority in most studies, but ranked seventh in ours (although just behind the group of strongly preferred SDGs).  Regarding the SDGs with the lowest priority, the least preferred SDG (14 ‘Life below water’) in our study was included among the less-preferred SDGs in all studies. Most studies also identified 2 ‘Zero hunger’ and 15 ‘Life on land’ as weakly preferred, consistent with our research. Only PricewaterhouseCoopers (2019)  published SDG priorities for the Industrial manufacturing & Automotive sector. These SDGs included 8 ‘Decent work and economic growth’, 12 ’Responsible consumption and production’, 13 ‘Climate action’, 3 ‘Good health and well-being’, and 9 ‘Industry, innovation, and infrastructure’. Four of these goals (SDGs 8, 12, 13, and 3) were also considered a priority in our research. SDG 9 ‘Industry, innovation and infrastructure’, however, was ranked seventh herein. Table 4  presents the preferences in terms of the considered alternatives. We label as ‘highly preferred SDGs’ those with a relative frequency r   greater than 0.7. SDGs with a relative frequency r   less than 0.3 are considered less preferred in this study. The highly preferred SDGs are listed in descending order and less-preferred SDGs in ascending order with respect to the r   value. We observe massive differences in SDG preferences across the studied alternatives (economies). Only one SDG is highly preferred by all alternatives: 8 ‘Decent work and economic growth’. The second SDG, preferred by four of the six alternatives, is 12 ‘Responsible consumption and production’. In general, developed Asian economies (represented only by Japanese companies) have adopted most of the SDGs (relative frequency r = 0 . 948   ) (see the last column of Table 2 ). These companies strongly emphasise fulfilling 16 out of the 17 SDGs on average, and no less-preferred SDG was identified for this group. Companies from all other economies prefer to concentrate on a limited number of SDGs (relative frequency r   varies between 0.397 and 0.503).    5.2 Results of PROMETHEE and GAIA analyses In this section, we present the results of the PROMETHEE and GAIA analyses, namely, the profiles of the alternatives and dependencies between criteria and alternatives. Fig. 4  shows the GAIA plane of the examined input data. The quality of the compiled GAIA projection is equal to 89.7% (the value was automatically calculated by Visual PROMETHEE software). That is, only about 10% of information was lost by the projection, which fits the threshold set by Mareschal et al. (2008) ; thus, the projection is sufficiently reliable. The location diversity of the investigated alternatives in the plane is relatively large, that is, the companies belonging to particular alternatives (economies) contribute to the fulfilment of relatively different SDG groups through their activities. A certain similarity in preferences can be seen in developed American economies, developing American economies, developing Asian economies, and developed European economies. On the contrary, developing African economies and developed Asian economies have significantly different preferences in terms of SDGs than other economies.   Visual PROMETHEE software offers so-called action profiles, which display the unicriterion net flows of the alternatives as well as the GAIA plane, but in a different way. These action profiles help us assess the similarity of the SDG preferences of the considered alternatives in further detail. The action profile is represented by a bar chart, where the horizontal axis shows the individual SDGs and the vertical axis shows the values of their unicriterion flow ϕ  i  C   ( A  t   )     that fluctuate in the interval [ − 1 , 1 ]   . If the value of the unicriterion flow is negative, companies belonging to the given alternative tend to meet the relevant SDG less often than companies from all other alternatives, and vice versa. The action profile can also be used to define the order of the SDG preferences. The thresholds for assessing the level of SDG preferences were set to −0.2 and 0.2, respectively. This means that, for ϕ  i  C   ( A  t   )  ≤ − 0 . 2   , the corresponding SDG is considered a weakness for the given economy (it is followed substantially less often than other economies). In contrast, for ϕ  i  C   ( A  t   )  ≥ 0 . 2   , the corresponding SDG is considered a comparative strength for the given economy (it is followed substantially more often than by other economies). Fig. 5  shows the action profile of developing African economies. Compared with other alternatives, companies from developing African economies are clearly more likely to prefer (ϕ  i  C   ( A  t   )  ≥ 0 . 2   ) 16 ‘Peace, justice and strong institutions’, but less likely (ϕ  i  C   ( A  t   )  ≤ − 0 . 2   ) to prefer 9 ‘Industry, innovation and infrastructure’, 17 ‘Partnerships for goals’, 2 ‘Zero hunger’, 14 ‘Life below water’, 11 ‘Sustainable cities and communities’, 10 ‘Reduced inequalities’, 5 ‘Gender equality’, 3 ‘Good health and well-being’, 4 ‘Quality education’, and 7 ‘Affordable and clean energy’. However, it is necessary to emphasise here that this is an alternative covering the lowest number of companies, and thus the lower representation of this group is achieved. Even such a representation can be relevant because the database used covers the biggest and the most important companies in the market. Fig. 6  shows the action profile of developing American economies. Compared with all other companies, companies from developing American economies do not prefer any SDGs substantially more often than other considered economies. 7 ‘Affordable and clean energy’ and 13 ‘Climate action’ are the SDGs adopted with substantially lower frequency than the other alternatives.  Fig. 7  shows the action profile of developed American economies. Companies in developed American economies do not prefer any SDG at a substantially higher rate than all other companies. However, their emphasis on 6 ‘Clean water and sanitation’, 1 ‘No poverty’, 11 ‘Sustainable cities and communities’, 10 ‘Reduced inequalities’, and 15 ‘Life on land’ is even lower in comparison with other groups.  Fig. 8  shows the action profile of developing Asian economies. Compared with the other considered alternatives, companies belonging to developing Asian economies are likelier to declare the fulfilment of SDG 1 ‘No poverty’. On the edge of their interest are two SDGs: 16 ‘Peace, justice and strong institutions’ and 9 ‘Industry, innovation and infrastructure’.  Fig. 9  shows the action profile of developed Asian economies. Compared with all other alternatives, the companies in this group (all of them are Japanese companies) largely prefer all SDGs except SDG 8 ‘Decent work and economic growth’. However, this goal is also strongly supported; its preference is reduced because it is also a generally preferred SDG across economies. The preference order of the remaining SDGs (in descending order according to unicriterion flows) is as follows: 14 ‘Life below water’, 7 ‘Affordable and clean energy’, 15 ‘Life on land’, 10 ‘Reduced inequalities’, 11 ‘Sustainable cities and communities’, 17 ‘Partnerships for the goals’, 6 ‘Clean water and sanitation’, 9 ‘Industry, innovation and infrastructure’, 2 ‘Zero hunger’, 1 ‘No poverty’, 16 ‘Peace, justice and strong institutions’, 4 ‘Quality education’, 13 ‘Climate action’, 3 ‘Good health and well-being’, 5 ‘Gender equality’, and 12 ‘Responsible consumption and production’. Thus, there are no SDGs which are adopted by developed Asian economies substantially less often than by other economies.  Finally, Fig. 10  shows the action profile of developed European economies. Compared with all other companies, and like developed American companies, companies from developed European economies do not significantly prefer any SDG than the compared alternatives. However, three SDGs are substantially less common: 15 ‘Life on land’, 1 ‘No poverty’, and 16 ‘Peace, justice and strong institutions’.     6 Discussion Most of the 136 surveyed companies are located in developed European economies, followed by companies from developing Asian and American economies. Developed Asian and American economies and developing African economies are represented by a relatively small sample of companies. European and Asian transition economies and Australian developed economies contain only a couple of companies (or they are empty). From the perspective of the countries in which the headquarter of the surveyed companies is located, 40 out of 193 UN member states are represented. These results answer both our research questions: (1) What are the SDGs priorities in automotive industry and to what extent are the results of our research in line with the studies already conducted?   By far, the world’s most preferred SDG in the automotive industry is 8 ‘Decent work and economic growth’ (see Fig. 3 ) because it represents the most obvious link to business. This goal is followed by a group of goals with a similar priority: 3 ‘Good health and well-being’, 5 ‘Gender equality’, 12 ’Responsible consumption and production’, 13 ‘Climate action’, and 4 ‘Quality education’. This is because the examined sample includes more than half of the companies from developed European economies. The resulting order thus almost matches the priorities of these companies, where a main motive for adopting the SDGs is the tightening regulation of sustainable reporting (Lashitew, 2021 ). A clear example is the EU’s Non-Financial Reporting Directive, which will be replaced by a new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. This directive introduces reporting requirements that oblige companies to disclose their sustainability targets and transition plans. These targets are in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This way, they are linked to the most preferred SDGs identified in our research. On the opposite side of interest are SDGs 14 ‘Life below water’ and 2 ‘Zero hunger’, which are followed by 1 ‘No poverty’ and 15 ‘Life on land’. It may be that these SDGs are very complex and are very difficult for businesses to adopt without broad partnership with governments and civil society (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018 ). These results are in line with established research covering the whole world and wide range of sectors (see Table 3 ). In fact, differences were evident in studies that examined companies from developing countries only. It is also very interesting to compare the results with the UN Global Compact strategy 2021–2023 (UN Global Compact, 2021b ), which prioritises five SDGs where the UN Global Compact will seek to lead and shape: 5 ‘Gender equality’, 8 ‘Decent work and economic growth’, 13 ‘Climate action’, 16 ‘Peace, justice and strong institutions’, and 17 ‘Partnerships for the goals’. On the contrary, the same source defines the six SDGs with the lowest priority, where the UN Global Compact is best positioned to follow and amplify existing efforts: 1 ‘No poverty’, 2 ‘Zero hunger’, 3 ‘Good health and well-being’, 4 ‘Quality education’, 11 ‘Sustainable cities and communities’, and 15 ‘Life on land’. A comparison with our results and other global studies shows relatively fundamental differences in the defined priorities. These comparisons confirm the legitimacy of examining the second research question: (2) Are there any patterns in SDG prioritisation from the point of view of geographic, cultural, social, or economic specifics of the countries in which companies operate?  We show that the preferences of SDGs are strongly dependent on the continent (i.e. geographical, cultural, and social conditions) and the basic economic performance of the country in which the automotive companies are headquartered. Table 5  presents the synthesis of the analyses and results. In Table 5 , each column belonging to an alternative (economy) is divided into two sub-columns. The first of them includes the results of the frequency analysis (i.e. the relative adoption frequency r  ) with the SDGs that are most often chosen in green (highly preferred SDGs with r ≥ 0 . 7   ) and the rarely adopted SDGs in red (less preferred SDGs with r ≤ 0 . 3   ). The second sub-column shows the results of the PROMETHEE analysis and unicriterion net flows ϕ  i  C   ( A  j   )    . The colour green indicates the SDGs adopted much more often compared with other economies (alternatives), namely, with ϕ  i  C   ( A  j   )  ≥ 0 . 2   . Conversely, the colour red indicates the SDGs chosen less frequently by the companies belonging to the given economy in comparison to the others (with ϕ  i  C   ( A  j   )  ≤ − 0 . 2   ). The partial results in Table 5  can be interpreted according to the scheme given in Table 6 .  Table 5  and Fig. 4  (GAIA plane) clearly show that developed Asian countries, in the input data set represented just by Japanese companies, have completely different preferences. In the vast majority of cases, Japanese companies report to all SDGs, making them conclusively different from all other companies. This may be because Japan has an active UNGC Local Network, active civil society network on the SDGs, and certain cultural characteristics that are beneficial to this end, such as long-term orientation or uncertainty avoidance (van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). Japan has also been actively promoting SDG localisation at national and local levels (Masuda et al., 2021 ). Another alternative that differs quite significantly from the others is the developing African economy (see Fig. 4 ). The surveyed companies report nine less preferred SDGs for this alternative (see Table 5 ). Surprisingly, these SDGs include areas that plague the African continent, that is, poverty, hunger, and water scarcity. It may be that companies in these countries perceive little public pressure promoting the sustainability topics in general (van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020 ). African companies strongly prefer SDG 16 ‘Peace, Justice, Strong Institutions’, unlike the vast majority of other surveyed companies (excluding Japanese). This preference can be explained by the tendency of countries with weak governmental laws to be more pressured by trade unions, employees, activists, shareholders, and society at large (Rosati and Faria, 2019a ). However, these conflicting results can also be attributed to the small number of companies in this group, resulting in a limited representation of the results. Table 5  also shows similarities between the other economies examined (they have similar priorities for certain SDGs). To define these similarities more precisely and clearly, we analysed them further. The GAIA plane in Fig. 4  shows that the greatest similarities (shortest distances between alternatives) are between these economies (arranged from shortest distance): (1) developing American and developed European economies, (2) developing American and developing Asian economies, (3) developed American and developed European economies, and (4) developing Asian and developed European economies. We derive this result by calculating the absolute deviations of unicriterion net flows ϕ  i  C   ( A  i   )     between the listed alternatives. A deviation of 0.05 was considered the similarity cut-off. If the deviation is less than 0.05, then the priority of the given SDG is highly similar in both economies. Visually, the similarity of the SDGs between the alternatives can be assessed based on the action profiles (see Figs. 6 to 8 , and Fig. 10 ). Table 7  summarises the results of the similarity analysis.  Based on studies that examined the influence of the development level of political, legal, economic, social, and cultural factors (Rosati and Faria, 2019a; van der Waal and Thijssens, 2020; Bose and Khan, 2022 ), as well as standards and regulation of sustainable reporting (Lashitew, 2021; Elalfy et al., 2021; Bose and Khan, 2022 ) on SDGs reporting, we assumed that our research would demonstrate similarity among developed economies and, in the same way, among developing economies for SDGs prioritisation. However, our conclusions show that companies that have already adopted the SDGs may have completely different priorities, even if they are situated in economies with a similar level of development. Typical examples are the completely different priorities of companies from developed Asian economies compared with developed American and European economies, and companies from developing African economies compared with developing American and Asian economies. Moreover, we find similarities between (1) developing American and developed European economies, and (2) developing Asian and developed European economies. This confirms the correctness of using the combination of factors chosen in our study, namely, continent and basic economic performance of the country. The findings may be particularly important for practice (managers, professional associations, investors, shareholders, and other stakeholders) and policy (policymakers, regulatory bodies, and sustainability initiatives). The mentioned groups are key decision-makers who can help fulfil the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development from a business perspective. Therefore, the implications for practice and policy will be discussed in more detail. Moreover, the results may be of interest to researchers working on SDGs and corporate sustainability topics. (1) Managers and professional associations  This study aims to support managers and professional associations in developing a better understanding of key SDG priorities in different geographic, economic, cultural, and social conditions around the world. This could be particularly important for multinational corporations operating across continents and countries. If a multinational corporation is to be successful, it should adapt its SDG priorities and sustainable strategies to the expectations of stakeholders in individual regions. A clear example of the correctness of this approach is the very fundamental differences in priorities between developed Asian economies and the rest of the world, as identified in our study. Our results can be also helpful for small and medium enterprises from different regions that are just planning to adopt the SDGs as an integral part of their sustainability strategy, but do not have the resources and capacity for the demanding process of materiality analysis. Finally, our findings can motivate professional associations to create priorities in the field of SDGs and sustainable strategies for their members. For example, in the automotive industry, prestigious international associations such as the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers or European Automobile Manufacturers Association do not yet have strategies aimed at adopting the SDGs. (2) Investors, shareholders, and other stakeholders  This study might also be useful for potential investors, shareholder, and other stakeholders that evaluate commitment of companies from different regions to sustainability and SDGs. Given the very rapid increase in companies adopting SDGs, these groups will no longer only assess whether companies conduct SDG reporting and formulate strategies, but will focus on priorities based on regional specifics. (3) Policymakers, regulatory bodies, and sustainability initiatives  A growing number of companies from both the automotive and other industries are committed to meeting the SDGs adopted by the UN member states. However, the 136 active SDG supporters from the automotive industry who report the SDGs to the UN Global Compact (sample of our study) still comprise a small group. By comparison, the German Automobile Industry Association alone brings together more than 650 automotive manufacturers and suppliers (VDA, 2021 ). Therefore, the first implication for policy is to increase the motivation of companies to adopt the SDGs and corresponding sustainable activities. Furthermore, our study can help policymakers, regulatory bodies, and sustainability initiatives develop region- and country-specific policies, incentives, and instruments aimed at the SDGs with the highest priority for business and, thus, use limited resources effectively. However, policymakers such as governments may have their own SDG priorities that will not fully reflect the business priorities we have identified. Some SDGs are very complex and difficult for business to adopt. Our study shows that these are mainly SDG 1 ‘No poverty, 2 ‘Zero hunger’, 14 ‘Life below water’, and 15 ‘Life on land’. According to van Zanten and van Tulder (2018) , a partnership among actors from policymaking, business, and civil society is a way to contribute to these SDGs. Businesses can thus contribute to the achievement of goals that cannot be achieved individually by each of the given actors. Finally, van Zanten and van Tulder (2018)  also recognised that companies engaged in different sectors are active in different SDGs. Thus, the task for policymakers, regulatory bodies, and sustainability initiatives is also to align policies, incentives, and instruments to sectors that are more willing to include preferred SDGs in their sustainability strategy. Our study identifies these priorities for the automotive and related industries.  7 Conclusions The main goal of this study was to prioritise SDGs in the automotive industry as a key global sector. While similar studies have researched SDG prioritisation at a global, regional, or country-specific scale, we focussed on the geographical, cultural, social, and economic specifics of countries in which companies from the automotive industry operate. For this purpose, data from the UN Global Compact database were used for frequency and PROMETHEE analyses (including the GAIA plane). In addition to the identification of highly, moderately, or less-preferred SDGs, we confirm significant differences in the preferences of companies operating in different continents and countries with different basic economic performances. Based on these results, we formulate specific implications for practice and policy. One of the main limitations of the study is its lower representation for groups with too small a number of companies. However, the number of companies that apply to the SDGs and declare their progress in building sustainability under the UN Global Compact can be expected to increase in future owing to the growing stakeholder demand for business sustainability and the tightening legislative requirements for environmental protection and to curtain non-financial reporting in developed countries. Furthermore, the analysis is built only on the declaration of the companies that they will adopt some set of SDGs without feedback on the quality and quantity of their fulfilment. For these reasons, future research should focus on verifying and extending our results, especially through trend analysis and the search for similarities and differences in priorities over time. One pertinent question that still needs answering is ‘Will the gradually growing global interest in adopting the SDGs and the high degree of globalisation of the international business environment reduce the differences in SDG prioritisation within continents and different types of economies?’ A greater number of companies in the input dataset would also allow us to determine other external and also internal factors affecting the prioritisation of the SDGs. These potential factors have been identified in the literature review.  CRediT authorship contribution statement Radim Lenort:  Conceptualization, Investigation, Resources, Writing.
