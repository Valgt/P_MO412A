               This chapter introduces the biodiversity effects on the ecosystem and sustainable development goals (SDGs). It starts by presenting an overview of biodiversity meaning, importance, threats, and conservation strategies. It then explains the emerging role of biodiversity as a source of important materials and the relationship between biodiversity and climate change. Moreover, it includes biodiversity threats and methods of conservation, nature conservation, conventional and emerging biotechnological techniques to conserve biodiversity, and the relationship between biodiversity and sustainability. By the end of the chapter, the main elements of the future scope and research opportunities on the role of artificial intelligencein biodiversity conservation, as well as SDGs, are explained. A full discussion of biodiversity effects on the ecosystem and sustainable development is included to show their relationship with the key concepts of biodiversity importance, climate changes, nature conservation, emerging biotechnological techniques, sustainability, and with biodiversity conservation methods entities, protocols, and procedures.

It starts by presenting an overview of biodiversity meaning, importance, threats, and conservation strategies. It then explains the emerging role of biodiversity as a source of important materials and the relationship between biodiversity and climate change. Moreover, it includes biodiversity threats and methods of conservation, nature conservation, conventional and emerging biotechnological techniques to conserve biodiversity, and the relationship between biodiversity and sustainability. By the end of the chapter, the main elements of the future scope and research opportunities on the role of artificial intelligencein biodiversity conservation, as well as SDGs, are explained. A full discussion of biodiversity effects on the ecosystem and sustainable development is included to show their relationship with the key concepts of biodiversity importance, climate changes, nature conservation, emerging biotechnological techniques, sustainability, and with biodiversity conservation methods entities, protocols, and procedures.   Keywords Biodiversity  bioeconomy  climate change  nature conservation  sustainability   5.1 An overview of biodiversity meaning, important, threats and conservation strategies  Biodiversity generally refers to the billions of unique living organisms including unicellular bacteria, archaea, and fungi to giant animals such as blue whales, African elephants, and giraffes and plants such as Ficus, Conifers, and Cycades on Earth. These all biological components are in interaction with each, which changes as a result of a change in environmental factors. This defines the diversity among species in the biosphere. All ecosystems such as sea, water, and land where living organisms are found are pivotal for various ecosystem services we humans receive (Haahtela, 2022 ). Biodiversity is the variety of plants and animals inhabiting an ecosystem. It occurs at three different levels, namely, species diversity, genetic diversity, and ecosystem diversity (Fig. 5.1  ). The importance of biodiversity in a particular ecosystem will positively affect the quality of life of other living organisms in the environment and will support the needs that may arise. Biodiversity will be able to offer such advantages by facilitating energy flow and even information transfer, especially material circulation within the ecosystem (Gora et al., 2022 ; L. Liu, Zhang, et al., 2022 ). The importance of biodiversity continues to increase from the past to the present. The identification of new species and new highly valuable products is pressing the importance of biodiversity for a sustainable bioeconomy (Chapters 1 and 3 Chapter 1  Chapter 3    ). Throughout history, biodiversity has provided many services that human societies depend on materially, spiritually, culturally, and esthetically (Cafaro, 2022 ). Biodiversity forms the basis of the functioning of all ecosystems. Similarly, biodiversity has value both on its own and in terms of ecological, genetic, social, economic, scientific, cultural, recreational, and esthetic aspects  (providing various ecological services) (Costanza et al., 1997 ). In addition, biodiversity is important for the maintenance and evolution of life support systems in the biosphere (Linhares et al., 2023; Sobti et al., 2023 ). As an example of the importance of biodiversity, in an ecosystem where there are many different plant species, plants can gain resistance against invasive organisms that can harm them and can provide more production. For instance, diverse native plant communities tend to be resistant to biological invasion and resilient to a range of abiotic threats meantime providing multiple ecosystem services (Gross et al., 2017 ). Likewise, the diversity of living organisms in the aquatic ecosystem can provide various ecosystem services including but not limited to, water purification, carbon sequestration, nutrient balance, and maintaining chemical and biological oxygen demand (Scherer-Lorenzen et al., 2022 ). Biodiversity plays an important role in meeting people’s food, medicine, and other requirements we encounter in every walk of life and thus contributes to various sustainable development goals (SDGs). Biodiversity is especially essential for food security (Zero Hunger SDG 2). The basis of all agricultural products and plant and animal species produced is based on their wild relatives in nature. Today, wild species are used to obtain new agricultural products or to improve existing ones according to the needs of people (Hazarika et al., 2022; Saaondo & Olalekan, 2023 ). By providing clean air, water, and  soil with such advantages where biodiversity exists, a better sustainable environment is provided where various requirements for human life can be met (Brevik et al., 2022 ). Without biodiversity conservation, achieving SDGs is only wishful thinking. According to biodiversity research, exposure to natural habitats enhances the human microbiota, maintains immunological balance, and guards against allergies and inflammatory illnesses (Haahtela, 2019 ). The existing order may be disrupted by the reduction or negative impact on biodiversity and threat to some species. Extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, storms, and tornadoes have quick and substantially visible impacts on biodiversity. However, the results from a great deal of theoretical and empirical studies show that the greatest threat to biodiversity is due to intensified agricultural activities, urban development, and the unparallel use of fossil-based energies. The majority of the losses in biodiversity are due to excessive population growth and urbanization as well as the irregular use of natural resources, pollution, destruction, and climate change (Chapungu et al., 2023; Prakash & Verma, 2022 ). Natural systems that give humans food, water, and other benefits from nature have undergone tremendous stress due to the fast degradation of ecosystems and biodiversity over the past 50 years (McElwee et al., 2020 ). Along with the increasing threats to biodiversity, they reported that as a result of the studies conducted between 2006 and 2015, the number of living species under the threat of extinction increased and according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 60% of the ecosystem was completely deteriorated and irreversibly destroyed (Habibullah et al., 2022 ). Many strategies are being developed and implemented to protect biodiversity. At the beginning of these, measures such as limiting urbanization and keeping it away from threatened ecosystems reduced the use of chemical materials such as the irregular use of pesticides, especially by farmers, preventing wild hunting and raising awareness among people can be taken (Barral & Guillet, 2023; Mueller et al., 2023; Pour, 2023 ).  5.2 The emerging role of biodiversity as a source of important materials In addition to the ecological values of biodiversity among living things, it meets the basic resources in many areas such as water, food, shelter, medicine, and clothing that can be used for humans (Silvestro et al., 2022 ). The genetic diversity of plants provides resilience to species and acts as an immense opportunity to get new medicinal resources. The maintenance of genetic diversity is of paramount importance and can be met through different pollination and conservation methods. Plant species with rich bioactive molecules and different bioproperties have been used for years to treat human diseases. It is used as the main material for the production of antibodies that can prevent the disease on some diseases of various plants. Thus, the presence of biodiversity in the production of natural medicines improves the pharmaceutical industry  and can eliminate the lack of raw materials that will facilitate the treatment of diseases (Audah, 2019; Sharma et al., 2019 ). Examining the effects of biodiversity on food and agriculture reveals how important pollination, product development, and pest management are for the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity. As a significant contributor to agriculture and food systems, biodiversity has always been intertwined with human activity and is prone to accelerating planetary changes. These interactions cover the growth and development of livestock and crops, the functions provided by agroecosystems, and human diets, food, and health (Zimmerer et al., 2019 ). Biodiversity emerges as a source of raw materials, including the textile industry, as well as the health and food industry. For example, Agave Sisalana Perrine can be used as a fiber source (Howes et al., 2020 ). The places with high levels of biodiversity in terms of wood are said to be rich in wood materials and cellulose raw resources. The unplanned consumption of this biodiversity, however, is widely recognized to cause deforestation and a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, both of which can contribute to climate change (Ortiz et al., 2021 ).  5.3 Biodiversity and climate changes Globally, the climate change concept has a broad term; however, it is defined as a “long-term change of weather patterns in a given area, any changes in the environment due to anthropogenic activities or natural processes is referred to as climate change” (Gogoi & Lahon, 2022 ). The ecosystem is a set of life forms consisting of interacting biotic and abiotic components with each other and with their surrounding environment. Therefore, an ecosystem is a biological population interacting with its surrounding environment. However, the ability of an ecosystem to be stable and adapted to the disturbances in its surrounding environment such as climate change resulting a healthy ecosystem (A. K. Verma, 2017 ). Rich biodiversity and healthy ecosystems are fundamental to sustaining life on the earth. Biodiversity is explored usually at three levels of diversity such as ecosystem diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity (Ashok Kumar Verma, 2021 ). The rate of global nature change has accelerated during the past 50 years due to direct and indirect drivers of changing nature. Climate change is introduced as a direct driver change in nature that is contributed to increasingly magnifying the impact of other drivers on nature and human well-being. Thus, climate change impacts accelerate and are reflected in many aspects of biodiversity, such as species distribution, ecosystem function, phenology, and community structure. According to observational evidence, the effects are accelerating in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems and dominant agricultural patterns (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services; The global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services, 2019 ). The diversity of wild resources has become critically threatened in recent years due to the  consequences of climate change (L. Liu, Zhang et al., 2022 ). However, climate change can impact biological processes at multiple levels of biological organization, from individuals to populations and communities, and from physiological to ecological and evolutionary processes. The adaptation and response of an ecosystem to climatic changes are usually complex and cannot be always generalized (Vázquez et al., 2017 ). A very recent study using a global dataset collected from 115 countries and from the Red List published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature explored the adverse impacts of global climate change on biodiversity conservation. However, the study concluded that the climatic variability of temperature, precipitation, and natural disaster occurrences increase biodiversity loss, and higher economic developments are also playing a critical role in accelerating the negative impacts on biodiversity conservation (Habibullah et al., 2022 ). Climate change is influencing all natural systems on Earth planet (Lenton et al., 2019 ). Thus, research and literature reviews on the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystems at a global scale are profoundly needed (Sheldon, 2019 ). Ecosystem services defined as the environmental conditions and services are supplied and maintained by ecological systems that are considered the environmental basis for the survival and evolution of an ecological community (Gao, 2020 ). Climate change has significant impacts on the ecosystem’s balance for ecological communities. Climate change has negative effects on certain species, their interaction with other living organisms, and their habitat loss, which pose serious threats to the survival of these affected species. Moreover, climatic shifts due to climate change are a serious threatening factor contributing to deforestation, cultivation shifts, and overexploitation of natural resources, which lead to disturbance of the ecosystem’s balance. Therefore, both disturbances of ecosystem balance and climate change are major challenges that contribute to the loss of biodiversity worldwide (Turyasingura & Mohammed, 2022 ). The continual and growing impacts of climatic variabilities are a serious threat to ecosystems and biodiversity worldwide. These impacts have disturbed the timing of animal and plant species reproduction, as well as the migration of affected species changes in population size and species distribution, and their habitat loss (Fonseca et al., 2022 ). Sustaining and restoring a healthy ecosystem balance constitute a key approach to mitigating and adapting to climate change for biodiversity conservation (Srivastava et al., 2019 ). Climate change is altering and disturbing the structure and function of ecosystems in the affected communities. Thus, there is a pressing need to understand and assessment of ecosystem responses to climate change impacts for environmental management interventions development and enhance resilience measures in order to mediate consequent altering in biodiversity and natural systems function (Anabaraonye et al., 2022; Feeley et al., 2017 ). However, climate change and biodiversity loss are expected to have synchronous effects on ecosystems, whereas many researchers studied the impacts of climate change on biodiversity loss, and research to understand the inherent mechanisms of how each driver change factor  mitigates the other is still limited. The interactive effects of variations in rainfall with garden litter diversity on ecological processes using tank bromeliad ecosystems concluded that ecosystem functions are influenced by the variability of rainfall with diminished letter diversity in three aspects such as their stability, the inherent mechanisms, and non-additivity in response (Pires et al., 2018 ). This study demonstrates the necessity of studying of interactive impacts of global climate change to predict future ecosystem functions (Pires et al., 2018 ). The stability of future ecosystem functions, particularly for sustainable food security under global climate change via adapting and mitigation measures, is a vital matter. Future climatic changes will have environmental disturbances followed by substantial impacts on both resistance to more extreme events in the future and in turn recovery of ecosystem functioning (White et al., 2021 ). The unprecedented and unpredictable global climate is changing an ecosystem of species’ habitats, and many researchers conducted studies to predict species’ habitat distribution under different global climate change scenarios. There are variable results but most of the studies conclude there is a shift in the localization of species in future climate settings. For instance, Liao et al. (2023)  explored the current global distribution of suitable habitats of Pantala flavescens , a dragonfly, and its future shifts under different global climate change scenarios. The result of the study shows that the habitat suitability of P. flavescens  reduced with higher elevation, global climate change forced it to shift to higher elevations, and the habitat suitability of P. flavescens  around the equator expanded under the impact of global climate change (Liao et al., 2023 ). Due to climate change, species around the world have already been forced to change their ranges along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients (Haight & Hammill, 2020 ). Climate change impacts pose shifts in distributions of species that have moved to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 m and 16.9 km per decade to higher latitudes as well as extinction rates of 1103 species in a migration situation (Muluneh, 2021 ). Shi et al. studied the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of wild Meconopsis punicea , a perennial herb, using the maximum entropy (maxent) niche model; the study reported that the predicted climate change will decrease suitable habitat for M. punicea. T he distribution of this perennial herb was mainly governed by precipitation and temperature shifts; the study concluded that in the future, a potential reduction in the climatic niches not only for this species but also even those belonging to the same trait base, morphology, and physiology based on future greenhouse gas emission scenario (Shi et al., 2022 ). The effects of climate change on insects are complex, and in a few cases, climate change promotes the dominance of some insects particularly vectors of various diseases. However, climate change is impacting their distribution, diversity, abundance, development, growth, and phenology. The rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and temperatures as well as fluctuation of precipitation patterns affects the biology and ecology, and geographic range of agricultural insect pests and their natural enemies, especially invasive pest species, which can be a major problem in crop  production, agricultural crops, and their corresponding pests are directly and indirectly influenced by climatic fluctuations (Skendžić et al., 2021 ). Biodiversity loss expands with invasive species, high average temperatures, and precipitation (Gren et al., 2016 ). Climate change refugia are identified as areas that remain relatively buffered from changes in climate during large-scale, long-term that can protect species (Keppel et al., 2015; Morelli et al., 2017 ). However, identifying climate change refugia using systematic processes provides opportunities to improve protected area designations to reduce effects from non-climate stressors within potential refugia; this initial identification represents an initial step to managing refugia for climate adaptation (Barrows et al., 2020 ). The potential distribution of Neurobasis chinensis , a species of damselfly—considered a sensitive climate change indicator—under different scenarios of climate change revealed that annual mean precipitation, mean temperature of driest quarter, and precipitation patterns are important forming factors for the current and future geographical distribution of this species (Liao et al., 2022 ). Manes recently studied the differences in predicted responses between endemic, non-endemic native, and introduced species. Under a range of projected climate change scenarios, the study reported that climate change is projected to have adverse impacts in all assessed areas, but endemic species are more significantly and negatively affected; terrestrial endemics are projected to have 2.7 and 10 times more affected than non-endemic natives and introduced species respectively, with the introduced species being overall unaffected by climate change (Manes, 2021 ). On the other hand, climate change has significant impacts on global water resources. This leads to severe threats to aquatic biodiversity, and the conservation of water resources through long-term droughts, floods, melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, warming, and acidification of water resources. These drivers can subsequently influence modifying species, diversity abundance patterns, and community composition of water resources. According to The Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, 66% of the global ocean hydrosphere is affected by severe impacts that contribute to richness loss of ocean biodiversity (Ojija & Nicholaus, 2023; Talukder et al., 2022; The global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services, 2019 ). Aquatic ecosystems have a weak ability to respond to climate change impacts (Prakash, 2021 ). LeMoine et al. (2020)  reported that aquatic communities have a range of responses to climatic fluctuations, and enhancing the connectivity of water bodies could be an important climate adaptation measure for aquatic biodiversity conservation (LeMoine et al., 2020 ).  5.4 Biodiversity threats and methods of conservation A key component of ensuring resilient ecosystems and biodiversity is the development of new conservation and restoration strategies. Prioritizing species, habitats, and ecosystems with highly ambitious and achievable goals is urgently needed to save the earth  from foreseeing catastrophes (Díaz et al., 2020 ). In this context, building strategies start with defining the problem definition, and its causes are underway. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, the number of threatened species reached 42,108 from 150,388 species assessed in 2022. The critically endangered species were 9251. Additionally, 16,364 and 16,493 species were considered endangered and vulnerable, respectively [International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 2022]. These results may be related to one or more of the following threats and causes. 5.4.1 Threats The land use factor can impact biodiversity in different ways. Converting a natural ecosystem might be an open natural ecosystem (ONE), a grassland or prairie, forest, pond, river, etc. to other uses such as tree plantation on ONE, replacing forests for bioenergy crops, and utilizing small ponds or lakes for human settlements are destroying the shelter for various plants, animal, and microbes and inviting new exotic species. Sometimes, these new species or strains may create global health and ecological challenges. Urbanization is the first land use factor that can threaten the biodiversity in a specific area (Davison et al., 2021 ). According to the literature, the construction of buildings and roads encouraged the spread of invasive species (Forys et al., 2002 ). Researchers linked urbanization and the collapse of the global insect (Fenoglio et al., 2021 ). According to Salomão et al. (2020) , urbanization is one of the most significant reasons for habitat loss and fragmentation (Salomão et al., 2020 ). The second factor related to land use is the farming style, cultivating the land for food and livestock, which has the most pressing negative effects on biological diversity. As the food scarcity problem increases worldwide, more calories are needed and nations are trying to cultivate more crops intensively, further degrading ecosystems and putting pressure on available natural and intact ecosystems. Thus, the seminatural and biodiversity-rich grasslands are superseded with more beneficiary crops (Brambilla et al., 2021 ). Another solution for food security is to obtain crops with draught and climate-resistant capabilities by the gen-modification process. As a result of this process, the native plants are substituted by crossbred varieties. Therefore, the genetic resources of the native species and the associated microorganisms are lost. The uncontrolled use of fertilizers and pesticides decreases microorganism varieties (Sobti et al., 2023 ). Further, the mining activities to meet human needs endanger flora and fauna. Minimizing the ecologically sensitive zones around natural ecosystems such as forests negatively affects flora and fuana flora and fauna (Martins-Oliveira et al., 2021 ). Biodiversity loss may also occur because of air, water, and soil pollution. Regarding air pollution, polluted air causes diseases in the respiratory system by entering it. Also, it contributes to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and even mortality  (West et al., 2016 ). Beyond human health, all the ecosystem types are exposed to air pollution (Lovett et al., 2009 ). Reich and Amundson (1985)  stated that the ozone can reduce plants’ photosynthesis rates (Reich & Amundson, 1985 ). The acid rain resulting from SOx  and NOx  pollutants affects species diversity and richness in the aqua system (Brönmark & Hansson, 2002 ). The impact of air pollution on avian species is highly negative and substantial. Accordingly, air pollution was found to have adverse effects on population density, species diversity, and richness (Sanderfoot & Holloway, 2017 ). Water pollution adversely affects living being. Isik et al. (2022)  reported that the cationic dyes in the water bodies increase the death possibility of flora and fauna in the aquatic system (Isik et al., 2022 ). The presence of some heavy metals such as cadmium, arsenic, and chromium in the water causes environmental toxicity and human diseases (Saleh et al., 2021 ). Chen et al. (2020)  considered water pollution as one of the threats to aquatic biodiversity protection in the Yangtze River (T. Chen et al., 2020 ). Dulsat-Masvidal et al. (2023)  explored the threats of water pollution on bird and biodiversity areas in Spain. In their study, organic micropollutants, pharmaceuticals, and pesticide residues were classified as emerging threats to biodiversity conservation (Dulsat-Masvidal et al., 2023 ). Abdelhady et al. (2019)  investigated the metal pollution threats to the Nile-Delta region biodiversity. According to their results, faunal diversity has been significantly affected by metal pollution (Abdelhady et al., 2019 ). Soil pollution is one of the considerable aspects that threaten biodiversity by disrupting ecological balance, reproduction, and health (Bao et al., 2022 ). Sazykina et al. (2022)  explored the impacts of soil pollution on microbial communities and found that bacterial diversity is negatively affected by high pollutant concentrations. Also, the pollutants have influenced the bacterial taxa and soil microbiome (Sazykina et al., 2022 ). The outcomes of another study showed that soil biodiversity decreased with soil contamination by electronic wastes (X. Wang et al., 2022 ). Changes in soil biological health are also of great concern. A significant alteration in soil biodiversity has been observed due to increase soil salinity, greenhouse gas emissions, and unsustainable and frequent tillage practices (Haj-Amor et al., 2022 ). Natural calamities may affect biodiversity. For example, tropical islands suffer from violent cyclones, sea surges, and tsunamis, which affects negatively the biodiversity in these areas (Jaisankar et al., 2018 ). The assessment of the impacts of floods on terrestrial plant diversity shows a decrease in plant health and diversity due to floods. According to their results, floods have higher detrimental effects on grasses, and plant diversity is seriously affected by floods during summer rather than winter (Zhang et al., 2022 ). It is proved that the global pandemic COVID-19 happened due to biodiversity loss and recent studies show the ramifications of COVID-19 on biodiversity (Rondeau et al., 2020 ). Global biodiversity is threatened by invasive species introduction. There are significant and substantially visible impacts of biological-plant and animal-on structure and  functioning of native communities. All species that are introduced accidentally or intentionally for various purposes to new places are called invasive or exotic species. With human aid, invasive species enter the ecosystem and disrupt its balance (Linders et al., 2019 ). With changes in land use and climate, more invasive weeds are spreading around the globe and increasing the vulnerability to native diversity. Shabani et al. (2020)  expected future scenarios related to invasive weed species in changing climate conditions (Shabani et al., 2020 ). The loss of biodiversity caused by rapid climate change endangers human needs and security. Climate change compromises the whole natural resources, including flora and fauna (Abrahms et al., 2017 ). Also, the overexploitation of native species is another threat to biodiversity conservation. In this context, Hammerschlag and Gallagher (2017)  recorded passenger pigeons’ extinction due to overhunting (Hammerschlag & Gallagher, 2017 ). Bodeker et al. (2014)  noticed the disappearance of medical plants for the same reason (Bodeker et al., 2014 ).  5.4.2 Biodiversity conservation methods Biodiversity conservation was defined previously as the management of human uses to achieve the highest sustainable benefits for the present generation while maintaining the potential to meet the future generation (International Union for Conservation of Nature, 1980). Thus, biodiversity conservation aims to protect, maintain, sustainably use, restore, and enhance biodiversity (Kasso & Balakrishnan, 2013 ). The conservation process can be categorized into in situ and ex situ methods (Fig. 5.2  ).  5.4.2.1 In situ methods The conservation of genetic resources or species using in situ strategies occurs in their natural habitat or the simulated anthropogenic made environments (Convention on biological diversity C. o. b. d., 1992 ). This method is very suitable for wild flora and fauna since the in situ includes population fortification. According to Dudley and Stolton (2008) , the protection of species via in situ methods includes dedicating an area of land/sea for maintenance and biodiversity protection purposes, where the existence of dangerous species is eradicated by several appropriate mechanisms. In situ methods can be realized in different shapes, such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and community reserves (Dudley & Stolton, 2008 ). The national park is the first in situ method for protecting biodiversity. The utilization purpose of the national park is restricted to particular species conservation. Human activities in the national park are not allowed except for research and observation (Dar et al., 2022 ). The protected areas were found to play a significant role in amphibian conservation and the identification and enhancement of the amphibian decline crisis (Halstead et al., 2022 ). Likewise, stringent laws to protect natural ecosystems can deepen the diversity of flora and fauna. Chen et al. (2023)  investigated the quality of the habitat in China’s first group of national parks. In this context, an increasing pattern/trend was noticed for habitat quality from 1980–2019 (X. Chen et al., 2023 ). Bhat and Sofi (2021)  measured the willingness to pay for the improvement of Dachigam National Park, India (Bhat & Sofi, 2021 ). The type of protected area for the conservation of a particular species only refers to a wildlife sanctuary. In wildlife sanctuaries, the capturing and hunting of living wild species are also prevented. Over several papers, wildlife sanctuaries are weakly characterized qualitatively and quantitatively. Thus, several works were accomplished to deal with this problem (Anand et al., 2022; Jamloki et al., 2022; Noor et al., 2016 ). The conservation and community reserves are also in situ methods. Both of them have biodiversity-protecting purposes concerning the rights of land residents. In 1971, UNESCO launched the biosphere reserve program as a part of Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) to motivate sustainable development based on local community initiatives and sound scientific research. In this program, all life forms were preserved in situ methods so the whole system may be used as a reference for monitoring purposes (Dar et al., 2022 ).  5.4.2.2 Ex situ methods Ex situ conservation means the conservation of species outside their native environment under a human-controlled environment. The ex situ methods are efficient when the species are exposed to distinct threats, such as human disturbance, overexploitation, competition from exotic species, and diseases. To keep the genetic stock of threatened species healthy and viable, their populations are captured and bred under controlled  conditions (Borokini, 2010 ). The ex situ methods include zoos, aquariums, captive breeding, botanical gardens, and gene banks. Zoos or zoological parks are considered a method for biodiversity conservation where animals are confined partially or totally for public demonstration and breeding purposes (Melfi, 2012 ). In this context, the number of many endangered animals increased, and several species were saved from extinction because of zoos’ breeding (Lacy, 2013 ). Despite these benefits, Fernandez et al. (2009)  found that the interaction between animals and humans in zoos may induce stress for many species (Fernandez et al., 2009 ). The aquarium is the process of saving aquatic organisms in an artificial habitat for multipurpose, such as conservation, education, research, and recreation (Reid et al., 2013 ). The other technique in the ex situ conservation methods is captive breeding, which plays a significant role in the conservation of many endangered species. The species with fragmented populations are exposed to extinction due to the previously mentioned threats. Therefore, the availability of sufficient information on biology and husbandry species assists individuals in successful and safe captivity (Lewis et al., 2019; Modena et al., 2023 ). There are 77 amphibian species with active captive breeding and reintroduction programs for their conservation (Harding et al., 2016 ). However, captive breeding faces several challenges. The very first obstacle in captive breeding is the complications related to the nature of environment simulations that are associated with nutritional, husbandry, and habitat needs (Modena et al., 2023 ). In addition, the management of small and/or young populations results in genetic variety loss and demographic stochasticity. Also, the successfully adapted species in captive breeding programs may suffer during the reintroduction (Williams & Hoffman, 2009 ). In this context, researchers tried to solve these issues to answer the above challenges. A few researchers incorporated captive breeding with research programs for Panamanian Harlequin Frogs (genus Atelopus ) conservation in the United States (Lewis et al., 2019 ). Ariyaraphong et al. stated that the long-term conservation of wild Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus ) via captive breeding needs monitoring for genetic breeding plans monitoring (Ariyaraphong et al., 2021 ). Botanic gardens contribute directly to the plant's ex-situ conservation and indirectly to its immense associated wildlife. A recent study states that 30% of the known wild plant species (105,634 species) were conserved in the world’s botanic gardens (Mounce et al., 2017 ). There are a number of botanic gardens registered as a member of botanic gardens conservation international (BGCI|Botanic Gardens Conservation International). However many authors described there are different types of gardens based on their scale, nature, age, and geographic position. For example, Wyse and Sutherland categorized botanic gardens into twelve types: (1) classic multipurpose gardens, (2) ornamental gardens, (3) historical gardens, (4) conservation gardens, (5) university gardens, (6) combined botanical and zoological gardens, (7) agro-botanical and germplasm gardens, (8)  alpine or mountain gardens, (9) natural or wild gardens, (10) horticultural gardens, (11) thematic gardens, and (12) community gardens (Wyse & Sutherland, 2000 ). Each garden harbors a variety of plant (micro and macro flora) and animal (micro and macro fauna) species. Recently, Zhao et al. (2022)  through a systematic analysis of 52 botanical gardens in China found 1754 threatened species including 252 critically endangered, 589 endangered, and 913 vulnerable species are conserved in these botanic gardens. Chen and Sun (2018)  identified the role of botanic gardens in scientific research, conservation, and citizen science. In terms of evaluation of the ability of threatened plants that were conserved in the botanic garden to survive based on climatic provenance, a model was developed (Thomas et al., 2022 ). Genebanks were formed during the mid-20th century to conserve cultivated biodiversity as landraces were replaced by modern varieties. Gene banks have been established to store biodiversity based on the type of materials, allowing it to be utilized in the future for breeding programs or directly as a resource in anticipation of changes in environmental conditions or social demands (Díez et al., 2018 ). Kasso and Balakrishnan (2013)  classified the gen banks into seed banks, field gene banks, in vitro conservation, cryopreservation, and de-extinction by gene editing (Kasso & Balakrishnan, 2013 ). Ex situ conservation methods are an effective way to conserve and revive endangered species within a short period. However, several changes occur in storing species in an artificial environment, such as losses in genetic diversity, transpiration of inbreeding depression, and accumulation of detrimental alleles. Besides, the ethical constraints related to animal cloning make the ex situ method to be limited.    5.5 Nature conservation and biodiversity Ecological networks are becoming a key issue for nature conservation policy, and global nature conservation has evolved from site protection in its early days to existing conservation planning systems. Nature conservation is defined as the protection of animal, and plant species and the conservation of the ecological integrity of their natural or alternative habitats such as hedgerows, quarries, ponds, or other habitats shaped by humans. Its objective is to maintain good conservation status and to prevent or correct the degradation of ecosystems (Bennett & Wit, 2001 ). The term conservation has not a definition in the Rio Convention (from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, another name for the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992) when the word is often used there. There is no formal and definitive definition of nature conservation, but the terms are often the same as those used to explain sustainable development. The overall strategy for the biophysical environment and biodiversity thus refers to conservation as being the management of man’s use of the biosphere, enabling present generations to enjoy the lasting benefits while maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of  future generations (Tower, 2010 ). For Carl Jordan, it is a “philosophy of environmental management that does not lead to waste, exhaustion, extinction, or the resources and values it contains” (Management, 2000 ). Conservation biology (or conservation ecology) is a scientific discipline dealing with issues of loss, maintenance, or restoration of biodiversity. According to Robert Barbault, it is a crisis management discipline; it aims to identify populations in decline or revictual and endangered species, to determine the causes of their decline, propose, test, and validate means of remediation to this decline (possibly temporarily ex situ) (Bennett & Wit, 2001 ). Evelyn Hutchinson (1965) presents it “to preserve the actors of the evolutionary piece and the ecological decoration where it is played.” This discipline is recent and rather of Anglo-Saxon origin. However, the term was applied previously when some countries were influenced by cultural and architectural heritage conservation techniques and with general scientific ecology. In the second half of the twentieth century, its disciplinarity expanded by evolving toward ecology and relying on biogeography, landscape ecology, population genetics, modeling, and cartography, as well as on sociology, economics, philosophy, and political science (Slobodkin & Slack, 1999 ). The biology of conservation has greatly influenced international strategies for the protection of nature, including within the UN and UNESCO; the word is particularly present in the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) but has not been redefined (Smith & Maltby, 2003 ). The essential characteristics of conservation biology are the scientific field, in which nature conservation is the origin of conservation biology, a new science that applies the principles of landscape ecology, biogeography, and ecology, as well as population dynamics and genetics. Anthropology, economics, and sociology are also involved in the triple objective of restoring, protecting, and/or managing biodiversity. Michael E. Soulé, an American biologist and one of the founders of this new science, describes conservation biology as the “science of scarcity and diversity” (Science of Scarcity and Diversity, Michael Soulé’s title) (Bradshaw & Brook, 2010; Smith & Maltby, 2003 ), a new discipline that addresses the dynamics and problems of disturbed species, communities, and ecosystems. Its objective is to provide principles and tools for biological diversity preservation. He also describes this discipline as a “science of crisis” in which managers and biologists must provide quick and effective solutions to important conservation problems, such as preserving a population of endangered species. Conservation biologists often have to find answers and management methods to conservation problems for which they do not have all the data since theoretical tools and principles are still being developed, and we do not have all the information on the biology of the species to be managed (Bennett & Wit, 2001 ). With two complementary dimensions, as its name reminds us, the biology of conservation has two dimensions: “biology” and “conservation”, which make it both a  science and a field of application (with choice of means, but the obligation of result). In the theoretical dimension, it is that of biology, eco-ethology, and more generally of ecology called to try to understand the causes, modalities, and stages of the decline of certain species or populations, as well as their probabilities and conditions for survival, maintenance or restoration of species or populations. Especially conservation biology assesses, for a population and in a certain context, the minimum viable population (Milot et al., 2020 ) (MVP or Minimum Viable Population for Anglo-Saxons), which does not depend only on the number of individuals but also on the dispersion of individuals, their ability to meet and reproduce, maintaining sufficient genetic diversity, which may no longer be the case in revictual populations that appear viable; therefore, conservation ecology is concerned with “inbreeding depressions” and to “genetic drift” (T. Wang et al., 2019 ).  5.6 Conventional and emerging biotechnological techniques to conserve biodiversity The definition of biotechnology is briefly the art of living organisms used for the development of various products such as food, drink, and medicine production or for environmental sustainability and other benefits to the human being and other animal species. This science existed long before it was named because involved methods, principles, and techniques are very old, and they have developed since prehistoric times. The discovery of the milk conversation into cheese or yogurt or fruit juices fermentation into wine, or that beer made by fermenting solutions of malt and hops started the study of biotechnology (Manimala, 2001 ). More recently, in biotechnology, plant cross-pollination and animal cross-breeding were done by macro-biological techniques to improve product quality and/or fulfill specific standards or requirements. Although the discovery of microorganisms, antibiotics, causes of infectious diseases, and immunizations could probably be computed among significant discoveries, the newest biotechnological techniques are getting their existence to the discovery of DNA and many necessary techniques for gene cloning. The actual biotechnology is that researchers can do transgenic technology, which is to take a single gene from a plant or animal cell and insert it into another plant or animal cell of a different species (New Technologies in Agricultural Biotechnology: High Level Group of Scientific Advisors: Explanatory Note 02/2017, 2017 ). Biotechnology focuses on applications made possible by biological research in agricultural applications, industrial processes, aquatic applications, medical applications, and interdisciplinary, and so many applications like bioenergy generation from food wastes (Lc, 2010 ). Regardless of conventional or modern biotechnologies leading to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and outside of any control, the impact on biodiversity can be large due to potential genetic erosion resulting from a single varietal  orientation of interest (Milot et al., 2020 ). The positive aspects of biotechnology can be summed up on the one hand, the positive contribution of biotechnology, not being limited only to the aspects of rapid evaluation of genetic resources, in addition, the sanitation of visored plants and micropropagation by in vitro culture of species destined for extinction. Modern biotechnology plays a big importance to biodiversity conservation, plant tissue culture role (micropropagation) in biodiversity conservation. It has different techniques such as cells-culture, anther and pollen culture, seeds-tissue culture, plant organ culture, and tissue culture, participating highly in biodiversity by vegetative multiplication, and allowing the production of a lot of plants from small pieces of the stock plant in relatively short periods of time, recovery of virus-free plants, production of somatic hybrids, organelle and cytoplasm transfer, and cryopreservation (use of freeze-preservation for germplasm storage) (T. Wang et al., 2019 ). On the other hand, the restriction of the field of biological diversity is also a probable result of biotechnological applications. Indeed, even if the requirement of homogeneous industrialized productions obtained by means of compliant in vitro culture has made the success of biotechnologies, it would also have led to the risk of loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity in general (Montreal, 2000 ). There are two different relevant applications of biotechnology or molecular biology. The use of biotechnology participates as a tool to acquire knowledge, while also the use of biotechnology intervenes directly in the field of plant and animals reproduction, in particular, to remove genetic information from one type of organism to a particular crop, or to a farm animal to make it genetically modified (Ammann, 2004 ). Today, biological sciences cannot be used without biotechnology in one way or another. Molecular markers are used in taxonomy to identify individual strains of organisms or species. This is useful for storing plants and microorganisms ex situ and to study the link between one plant variety and another, and genetic fingerprints are used in crop collections and seed banks. Biotechnology participates in the preoccupation with GMOs for biodiversity conservation (Karp, 1997 ). The introduction and spread of biotechnology have social consequences. This has led to a vigorous public debate on many different aspects, economic, legal, ethical, and environmental. The reluctance to apply recent biotechnologies began to be felt from the 1970s onward as researchers developed new methods for combining DNA segments and transferring them from one organism to another. It was then transgenesis and the problems of the ambivalence of biotechnology began to be tackled (Ammann, 2004 ). The differentiation of newly transformed organisms was the starting point for the accusation by undermining some of the natural properties of the species and thus their diversity; while others advocate that transgenesis is an excellent approach to increase, artificially, but sustainably, the spectrum of diversity by adding “useful” hereditary traits of genetically modified crops and their ethics and bioethics. However,  it is this “utility,” based on economic interests, that is taxed with distrust and concern about the possible loss of biodiversity. Moreover, GMOs are described as “disruptive” of the surrounding ecosystems, by genetic exchange of some of their characteristics (via pollination) with wild species and related weeds (Loevei et al., 2010 ). In 1992, more than 400 field trials were carried out on a small scale on various plant species such as cotton, maize, potatoes, rapeseed, rice, soybeans, and rice. The first introduction of a variety created by genetic engineering took place in 1994. It is a quality-improved tomato variety. International opinion remains aware of the positive and negative effects of biotechnology on biodiversity that will continue to precede and condition an appropriate development of all applications, from transgenics to livestock and agriculture. It is for this reason that biodiversity was the subject of the first international agreement in Rio in July 1992, under the United Nations Convention on Environment and Development, which has the conservation of biodiversity, its sustainable use, and the sharing of benefits from its exploitation as its objectives.  5.7 Biodiversity and sustainability Biodiversity is defined as the variety of life on Earth, encompassing all living organisms, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. Sustainability is the ability of human society to meet its needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. However, biodiversity is threatened by human activities, such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. The relationship between biodiversity and sustainability is complex and interdependent, with biodiversity providing many of the ecosystem services that are necessary for sustainable development. A study by Sandra Díaz et al. analyzed the relationship between biodiversity and 10 key areas of sustainable development, including food security, health, and climate change. The authors found that biodiversity is essential for achieving SDGs and that current efforts to conserve biodiversity are insufficient (Díaz et al., 2020 ). Another study by Forest Isbell et al. found that biodiversity loss reduces the ability of ecosystems to provide multiple ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and water purification. The authors argue that conservation efforts should focus on maintaining biodiversity to maximize the benefits provided by ecosystems (Isbell et al., 2019 ). However, they urge for scaling up the research of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in various production and natural ecosystems. A review by Vallet et al. (2018)  examined the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services in different types of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. The authors found that biodiversity is essential for maintaining the productivity and stability of ecosystems and that conservation efforts should focus on maintaining biodiversity at all levels of ecological organization (Vallet et al., 2018 ). Moreover, Du et al. (2019)  analyzed the  impact of land-use change on biodiversity in China. The authors found that habitat fragmentation and degradation are major threats to biodiversity in China and that conservation efforts should focus on preserving and restoring fragmented habitats (Du et al., 2019 ). Another study by Montoya et al. (2020)  analyzed the relationship between biodiversity and food security in developing countries. The authors found that agricultural systems that incorporate biodiversity are more resilient and productive than monoculture systems and that conservation efforts should focus on promoting agroecological approaches to food production (Montoya et al., 2020 ). A review by Johnson et al. (2019)  examined the impact of climate change on biodiversity and conservation strategies. The authors found that climate change is already affecting biodiversity and that conservation efforts should focus on preserving the genetic diversity of species to enhance their resilience to changing conditions (Johnson et al., 2019 ). A review by Hsu et al. (2021)  analyzed the impact of urbanization on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The authors found that urbanization is a major driver of biodiversity loss and that conservation efforts should focus on promoting green infrastructure and sustainable urban planning (Hsu et al., 2021 ). 5.7.1 Human impacts on biodiversity Human activities are the primary cause of the current biodiversity crisis, with many species facing extinction due to habitat destruction, pollution, and overexploitation (Fig. 5.3  ). According to a study by Pimm (2021) , the extinction rate of species is  currently 1000 times higher than the natural background rate. The study also found that the primary drivers of extinction are habitat loss and overexploitation, followed by climate change and pollution (Pimm, 2021 ). Another study by Díaz et al. (2020)  found that more than one million species are at risk of extinction due to human activities, with implications for the sustainability of ecosystems and human societies (Díaz et al., 2020 ).  5.7.2 Benefits of biodiversity for sustainability Biodiversity provides many essential ecosystem services that support the sustainability of human societies and ecosystems. For example, biodiversity is essential for maintaining soil fertility and nutrient cycling, as well as for pollination and pest control. A study by Mace et al. (2021)  found that protecting biodiversity is essential for achieving SDGs and ensuring the long-term sustainability of human societies and ecosystems (Mace et al., 2021 ).  5.7.3 Strategies for conserving biodiversity Conserving biodiversity requires a range of strategies, including protected areas, restoration of degraded habitats, sustainable land use practices, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A study by Watson et al. (2018)  found that protected areas are essential for conserving biodiversity and reducing the impacts of human activities on ecosystems. However, the study also found that protected areas alone are not sufficient to conserve biodiversity and that complementary measures, such as restoration of degraded habitats and sustainable land use practices, are necessary (Watson et al., 2018 ). Another study by DeFries (2019)  found that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential for conserving biodiversity, as climate change is a significant threat to many species and ecosystems. Biodiversity is essential for the sustainability of human societies and ecosystems, providing many essential ecosystem services. However, human activities are threatening biodiversity, with many species facing extinction due to habitat destruction, pollution, and overexploitation. Conserving biodiversity requires a range of strategies, including protected areas, restoration of degraded habitats, sustainable land use practices, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These strategies are essential for achieving the SDGs and ensuring the long-term sustainability of human societies and ecosystems.   5.8 Future scope and research opportunities on the role of artificial intelligence in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development goals Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform biodiversity conservation and support the achievement of SDGs. Recent research has highlighted the importance of AI in monitoring and managing ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as supporting sustainable agriculture and natural resource management. In this literature review, we  explore recent research on the future scope and research opportunities on AI’s role in biodiversity conservation and SDGs. AI can support the identification and monitoring of invasive species, which pose a significant threat to biodiversity (Feng et al., 2019). AI can support the development of smart cities, which can integrate biodiversity conservation into urban planning and promote sustainable development (Da Silva & Topf, 2020 ). It can support the development of biodiversity databases and facilitate data sharing between researchers and conservation organizations (P. Liu, Wang, et al., 2022 ). The use of AI in marine conservation can support the monitoring and management of marine ecosystems and promote sustainable fisheries (Huang et al., 2020). AI can help to address the data gaps in biodiversity conservation, by analyzing large datasets and providing more accurate and precise information on species distribution, abundance, and threats (Pimm & Raven, 2019 ). AI can be also used to monitor and manage invasive species, which can have devastating effects on native ecosystems and biodiversity (Jiang et al., 2011 ). AI can support the development of sustainable fisheries management practices, by analyzing data on fish stocks, fishing efforts, and environmental conditions to provide recommendations for sustainable fisheries management (Hobday & Matear, 2020 ). AI can be used to develop early warning systems for biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, by analyzing data on ecosystem health and identifying potential threats before they become irreversible (Garnett et al., 2018 ). AI can be used to monitor and manage wildlife trade, which is a significant threat to biodiversity and can contribute to the spread of zoonotic diseases (Challender, 2019 ). AI can support the development of sustainable energy systems, by analyzing data on energy consumption, production, and distribution to provide recommendations for sustainable energy practices (Cappello & Milici, 2019 ). AI can support the monitoring and management of biodiversity by enabling the analysis of large datasets and identifying patterns and trends (Ferrier et al., 2019 ). AI can enhance the effectiveness of conservation interventions by predicting the outcomes of management strategies and identifying the most effective interventions (Fernández et al., 2020 ). AI can support the management of protected areas by enabling more efficient and effective decision-making and resource allocation (Fuentes, 2020 ). AI can support the monitoring and management of marine ecosystems by enabling the analysis of large datasets and identifying patterns and trends (Guinotte, 2020 ). AI can support the development of sustainable agriculture and food systems by enabling more precise and efficient resource management (Fountas et al., 2020 ). AI has the potential to transform biodiversity conservation and support SDGs by improving our ability to monitor and manage ecosystems, support sustainable agriculture and natural resource management, and develop smart cities. There are many research opportunities for the integration of AI into conservation efforts, and ongoing research will be critical to realizing the potential of AI in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. The future scope of AI in biodiversity conservation is  immense and holds great potential for helping us better understand, protect, and manage the world’s biodiversity. From the literature, here are the most prominent examples of how AI can be used in this field: Predictive modeling: AI can help in developing predictive models that can forecast changes in biodiversity patterns and help us identify and prevent potential threats before they occur. For example, AI-powered algorithms can predict the impact of climate change on different species and habitats, allowing conservationists to take proactive measures to protect them. Monitoring and surveillance: AI can help in monitoring and surveillance of endangered species, allowing conservationists to track their movements, population density, and health status. AI-powered drones and cameras can collect real-time data and provide insights into the behavior and habits of wildlife, helping us to make informed conservation decisions. Wildlife identification: AI can be used to identify species through image and sound recognition technology. This can help in automating the process of species identification, making it easier and faster to monitor biodiversity and track changes in species populations. Habitat mapping: AI can help in mapping and monitoring habitat quality and quantity, which is crucial for conservation planning. By analyzing satellite imagery and other data sources, AI can provide accurate and up-to-date information on the extent and condition of different habitats, helping us to prioritize conservation efforts. Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize the field of biodiversity conservation by enabling us to collect and analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately and providing new insights and tools for protecting our natural world.
