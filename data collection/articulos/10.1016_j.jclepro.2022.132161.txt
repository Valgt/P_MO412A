                  Food waste is a worldwide issue due to its significant ecological, social, and economic impacts. China's high amount of food waste has resulted in severe environmental implications. Aside from the food waste ecological concerns, China also faces high energy consumption and demand. The Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) task countries worldwide to design environmental, social, and human development policies. Hydrogen gas from biogas derived from food waste is considered a potential source of clean energy production. The present study assesses how the energy and environmental benefits of hydrogen from biogas using food waste in China could contribute to realizing sustainable development goals. The biogas potential of food waste in 31 provinces of China was obtained using Buswell's equation. The amount of hydrogen from biogas was calculated using the steam reforming process's stoichiometric chemical equations with water-gas shift reaction. Mathematical formulation methods were used to determine the electricity production potential, amount of coal consumption saved and avoided greenhouse gas emissions. The key findings show that a total amount of 221.13

                     kg of hydrogen was generated in China. The hydrogen generated can produce 10,479.72 GWh of electricity. The electricity generated could contribute 0.13% to the estimated energy needs of China. It was found that a total of 616.27 Mt (2.10% of coal used for power generation during the period) of coal consumption could be avoided. The results indicate that a total of 1159.00 M kg of carbon dioxide, 159.00 M kg of methane, and 238.49 thousand kg of nitrous oxide emissions could be avoided. This study could provide scientific guidance for incorporating hydrogen to electricity plans into the national strategy for realizing SDGs related to solid waste management, clean energy, and climate action in China and other Asian countries.

Handling editor: M.T. Moreira Food waste is a worldwide issue due to its significant ecological, social, and economic impacts. China's high amount of food waste has resulted in severe environmental implications. Aside from the food waste ecological concerns, China also faces high energy consumption and demand. The Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) task countries worldwide to design environmental, social, and human development policies. Hydrogen gas from biogas derived from food waste is considered a potential source of clean energy production. The present study assesses how the energy and environmental benefits of hydrogen from biogas using food waste in China could contribute to realizing sustainable development goals. The biogas potential of food waste in 31 provinces of China was obtained using Buswell's equation. The amount of hydrogen from biogas was calculated using the steam reforming process's stoichiometric chemical equations with water-gas shift reaction. Mathematical formulation methods were used to determine the electricity production potential, amount of coal consumption saved and avoided greenhouse gas emissions. The key findings show that a total amount of 221.13 × 10 9    kg of hydrogen was generated in China. The hydrogen generated can produce 10,479.72 GWh of electricity. The electricity generated could contribute 0.13% to the estimated energy needs of China. It was found that a total of 616.27 Mt (2.10% of coal used for power generation during the period) of coal consumption could be avoided. The results indicate that a total of 1159.00 M kg of carbon dioxide, 159.00 M kg of methane, and 238.49 thousand kg of nitrous oxide emissions could be avoided. This study could provide scientific guidance for incorporating hydrogen to electricity plans into the national strategy for realizing SDGs related to solid waste management, clean energy, and climate action in China and other Asian countries.   Keywords Food waste  Hydrogen  GHG  Electricity  SDGs  Biogas    1 Introduction Proper food waste management is becoming highly essential worldwide due to associated economic, social, and environmental concerns (Abeliotis et al., 2015 ). Close to one-third (around 1.3 × 10 9    t/y) of the food produced yearly for human consumption at the global level is wasted (Gunasekera, 2015 ). Compared to developing countries, the per capita food waste generation in industrialized countries is higher (Jeswani et al., 2021 ). The per capita food waste generation in North America is 95–115 kg/y; in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, it ranges from 6 to 11 kg/y (FAO, 2011 ). Food waste disposal has significant environmental consequences (Salemdeeb et al., 2017 ). Food waste contributes to a total carbon footprint of 4.4 Gt CO2 eq annually (FAO, 2015 ). Degraded food waste could release greenhouse gases (GHGs) (Islam, 2021 ), contributing to global warming. Incinerated food waste also causes sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NOX ) pollution, which combine with moisture and acidify the water and soil (Tang, 2020 ). Another environmental issue associated with food waste is odor (Cerda et al., 2018 ). When food waste is used as feedstock in traditional anaerobic digestion technology (AD), a large amount of GHG emissions could be avoided. For instance, in the UK, it was found that the utilization of food waste as feedstock in AD technology could avoid about 163.3 CO2 eq GHG emissions (Pérez-Camacho et al., 2018 ). Also, biogas can be derived from food waste for electricity generation via AD technology (Zhang et al., 2021 ). China, a farming nation with a population of around 1.4 × 10 9     (Li et al., 2019 ), generates 130 Mt of food waste annually (Guo et al., 2019 ). The high amount of food waste in China has resulted in environmental issues such as land and water shortage, non-point source pollution, and phosphate rock reserve depletion (Li et al., 2020 ). China's food system's total environmental impact is expected to increase by 20–45% by 2030 (Hu et al., 2020 ). Industrial food waste management's general goal in China is to reach a 100% waste recycling rate, zero emissions, and energy consumption (Wen et al., 2016 ). This calls for an advanced and environmentally friendly food waste management system (Xu et al., 2020 ). Due to its inherent great energy capacity, hydrogen gas is identified as the potential energy carrier (Alves et al., 2013 ). Sustainable sources of hydrogen gas could be used as an alternative for fossil fuel in electricity production and transportation with no emissions of dangerous pollutants (Marcoberardino et al., 2018 ). It has been revealed that when hydrogen gas is used as an input to a fuel cell, it can produce power (Ayodele et al., 2019 ). The production of hydrogen gas is considered clean energy storage, provided it is generated from clean energy sources. Hydrogen has one of the most significant energy densities (mass basis) compared to other substances (Al-Zareer et al., 2020 ). For instance, the density of hydrogen (approximately 120 MJ/kg) is almost three times more than 45.5 MJ/kg for diesel and 45.8 MJ/kg for gasoline (Molloy, 2019 ). Hydrogen contributes to addressing several vital energy issues. Several hydrogen generation techniques and methods from many sources, such as sustainable energy sources, hydrocarbons, and nuclear energy, are available (Şahin and Şahin, 2021 ). In the short and medium run, the cheapest hydrogen generation processes are hydrocarbons (18% of oil, 30% of coal, and 48% of natural gas) and 4% from the water via electrolysis (Qu et al., 2021 ). In the long run, nuclear energy is required for efficient hydrogen generation (Bertrand et al., 2011 ). Hydrogen generation powered by renewable sources (RES) is more efficient for facility efficiency (Kowalczyk et al., 2019 ). Waste, mainly, food waste is one of such renewable sources (Khan, 2020 ). SWOT analyses conducted for different biotechnological conversion processes showed that valorization of food waste to hydrogen is a promising energy source and could have economic benefits (Thi et al., 2016 ). Han et al. (2016)  conducted a techno-economic analysis of food waste to hydrogen project in Hangzhou, China, and concluded that it was feasible. The researchers found that the capital return on investment and payback period was 26.75% and 5 y, while the internal rate of return was 24.07%. The lower operating cost makes large-scale food waste to hydrogen projects worth operating in terms of economic returns and environmental management (Jarunglumlert et al., 2018 ). The abundance and low cost of food waste make it more economically feasible for hydrogen production for power generation than other hydrogen production sources (Lee and Chung, 2010 ). A recent estimate conducted in the Philippines suggested that due to the high hydrogen generation potential (0.34–2.24 Mt/y), organic wastes in the country as a source of hydrogen production are possible (Ventura et al., 2021 ). In Nigeria, it was found that food waste can be a source of high hydrogen gas production, with a high electricity generation potential and a great ecological efficiency (Ayodele et al., 2019 ). The utilization of food waste as a source for hydrogen production could remedy the food waste management challenge (Yasin et al., 2013 ) and generate clean energy (Zhou et al., 2013 ). Using biogas in fuel cell technology and hydrogen production is a novel and economically feasible method for commercializing fuel cell technology in energy systems (Lanzini and Leone, 2010 ). The bio-methane reforming process results in hydrogen generation (Ayodele et al., 2019 ). Power could be directly produced from bio-methane in a turbine at efficiency as low as 20%–40% (de Groot, 2003 ). A hydrogen fuel cell is considered the best means for power generation. This is because of the high power conversion efficiency (50%–60%) of fuel cells such as Proton Exchange Membrane (Cook, 2001 ). This efficiency is more than twice the achievable efficiency with internal combustion engines. From the environmental impact perspective, a fuel cell is considered noise-free, and the only emission it produces is harmless water vapor (Cook, 2001 ). Steam reform, partial oxidation reform, autothermal reform, dry reform, and dry oxidation reform are the main methods to obtain hydrogen from biogas (Bala et al., 2019 ). The standard hydrogen production method is the reforming process that transforms hydrocarbons, mainly methane, into a high concentration of a mixture of hydrogen gas (Corigliano and Fragiacomo, 2015 ). Food waste valorization for hydrogen generation has piqued the curiosity of academics all over the world. Angeriz-Campoy et al. (2015)  studied bio-hydrogen yield from dry thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste and food waste. The researchers discovered that adding food waste boosts hydrogen generation in all solid retention durations studied. Han et al. (2016)  executed an economic feasibility analysis of valorizing food waste for hydrogen generation in Hangzhou, China. Algapani et al. (2016)  used food waste in continuous stirred-tank reactors to perform a long-term experiment comparing hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and hydrogen generation at 55 °C and 70 °C. Dinesh et al. (2018)  investigated the potentiality of food waste for bio-hydrogen generation via the fermentation process and the parameters that affect the fermentation process. Yuan et al. (2019)  assessed the possibility to enhance hydrogen production using untreated inoculum in a two-stage hydrogen-methane process from food waste. The authors pointed out that the highest hydrogen production was achieved at the greater F/M ratio due to the hydrogen-producing bacteria's enrichment and the reduction of the antagonistic bacteria. Deheri and Acharya (2020)  utilized an experimental approach to produce hydrogen from food waste via separate fermentative and methanogenic reactors. Through the thermal-equilibrium model and experiment, Zhang et al. (2020)  evaluated the potential of food waste for hydrogen production by anaerobic digestion and gasification processes. Huang et al. (2020)  used an integrated reactor to incorporate single-chamber microbial electrolysis cell treatment and anaerobic digestion to realize effective hydrogen yield from food waste. The study demonstrated the possibilities of food waste reduction with increased bio-hydrogen yield. Hou et al. (2021)  studied the enhancement effect of N2 -and-Air-nanobubble water supplementation on two-stage anaerobic digestion of food waste for separate generations of hydrogen and methane. In the first stage, the highest cumulative hydrogen yield was obtained from the increment of food waste + Air-nanobubble water by 38%. Park et al. (2021)  estimated the hydrogen generation potential of co-pyrolysis of food waste and wood bark. The study proved the effectiveness of co-pyrolysis as a process of the valorization of food waste and biowaste. Moogi et al. (2022)  converted food waste into hydrogen-rich gas via a catalytic steam gasification process. The effects of oxides such as MgO, CaO, and SrO with 10 wt% Ni/AI2 O2  on the gasification properties of food waste was investigated by the authors using a U-shaped gasifier. All the literature mentioned above are concerned with the hydrogen yield from food waste and its economic feasibility. The studies did not consider hydrogen's electricity generation potential and its environmental impact. Ayodele et al. (2019)  assessed hydrogen's electricity generation potential and environmental benefits from food waste. Due to the lack of historical data on waste generated in the study area, the authors used an extrapolated amount of feedstock (food waste) for hydrogen production, which is not the true reflection of the amount of food waste. The environmental analysis was limited to the carbon dioxide emissions that could be avoided due to displaced diesel fuel. Coal is also a significant fossil fuel largely used in several developing countries for power generation, and it is an important greenhouse gas emissions source. It is significant to investigate the role reduction in coal consumption could play in minimizing carbon dioxide and other potent GHG emissions. The present study uses historical data of food waste generated in China to determine the electricity generation potential and environmental benefits of hydrogen from food waste. The amount of coal combustion for power generation that could be displaced due to the consumption of electricity from hydrogen from food waste is evaluated. The study also estimates the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ), and nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions that could be avoided due to the avoided coal combustion. Besides, the role the energy and environmental benefits of hydrogen from food waste in China could play in realizing the SDGs related to solid waste management, clean energy, and climate change are assessed. This study could offer scientific guidance on environmental sustainability for hydrogen gas to electricity projects in China and other developing Asian countries with a similar culture. Also, the findings could provide scientific advice for incorporating hydrogen gas to electricity plan into the national strategy for the realization of SDGs that relate to solid waste management, clean energy, and climate action in China and other Asian countries with a similar culture.  2 The Sustainable development goals (SDGs) Since the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 by the United Nations (UN), many countries worldwide, their citizens, and institutions have been engaged in drawing policies that concern environmental, social, and human development (F. C. M. García et al., 2021 ). The UN Sustainable Development Goals highlight essential issues faced by people worldwide. When these goals are orderly tackled, the world will be safe (United Nations, 2020 ). There are 17 SDGs (see Fig. 1  ), each covering a critical field of sustainable development defined by many societal, economic, or ecological metrics (Lamichhane et al., 2021 ). It is reported that the economy-related targets such as SDG-8, SDG-9, and SDG-12 are close to being realized. A lot of improvement is still needed to realize targets such as SDG-4, SDG-11, and SDG-13 (Halkos and Gkampoura, 2021 ). China has integrated the 2030 Agenda in the 13th Five-Year Plan, launched in January 2016 to realize the SDGs. The country has established an inter-agency coordination mechanism involving 45 government departments. According to their administrative responsibilities, the 17 goals and 169 targets have been divided and assigned to different departments (Jiang, 2020 ). Table 1    presents the specific targets set in China related to solid waste management, clean energy, and climate action to respond to the SDGs and the respective department to take control.  3 Methodology This section of the study presents the methods employed to evaluate food waste in the provinces' waste stream, biogas recovery from the food waste, and hydrogen gas generation potential. The section presents the methods used to estimate compressed hydrogen gas and its electricity generation potential. The methods used to calculate the environmental benefits of hydrogen gas derived from biogas from food waste are detailed. The ecological benefits cover techniques for estimating the amount of coal consumption saved and the air pollutants (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) emissions avoided due to the use of power from hydrogen gas. 3.1 Evaluation of the amount of food waste in the waste stream The study used data on the amount of municipal solid waste generated in China's provinces from 2004 to 2018 (see column 2 of Table A1 ) and the percentage composition of food waste in China's waste stream to determine the amount of food waste. This study considered food waste because it constitutes the highest composition in China's waste stream. Besides, it is reported that the anaerobic digestion of food waste produces a high amount of biogas (Ayodele et al., 2019 ). Food waste is also highly degradable (Cudjoe et al., 2020 ) and is considered the best feedstock for bio-digester (Davis, 2014 ). The amount of food waste (wet weight) in the waste stream was determined using Eq. (1) :(1) F W ( P )   = A W s o l i d ( p )    × f c o m p       where, A W s o l i d ( p )       is the amount of solid waste generated and collected for disposal in the provinces from 2004 to 2018 (see column 2 of Table A1 ), f c o m p      is the average percentage composition of food waste in the waste stream of China, which is taken as 52.6 wt% (Zhang et al., 2010 ), and P    is the province of calculation.  3.2 Estimation of biogas generation potential from food waste Biogas is an essential energy resource that can serve as an alternative for fossil fuels and a hydrogen carrier (Shah et al., 2021 ). The feedstock's nature and the biogas generation process determine the raw biogas' composition (Rafiee et al., 2021 ). Biogas contains about 40–70% of methane (CH4 ), 35–55% of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), 0.1–3% of hydrogen sulfide (H2 S), a lower amount of moisture, and other trace gases (Miltner et al., 2017 ). Raw biogas generated through an anaerobic digestion process contains many impurities (Shah et al., 2021 ). The raw biogas must go through cleaning and upgrading processes before being supplied to the final consumers. The major challenge is cleaning and upgrading biogas to achieve high consumer quality (Rafiee et al., 2021 ). The estimation of theoretical biogas generation potential from the food waste with the composition of C ∞  H π  O τ  N ω     was done using Buswell's equation [Eqs. (2) and (3) ]:C ∞  H π  O τ  N ω  + ( ∞ − π 4  − τ 2  + 3 ω  4   )  H 2  O ⇒ ( ∞ 2  − π 8  + τ 4  + 3 ω  8   )  CO 2      (2) + ( ∞ 2  + π 8  − τ 4  − 3 ω  8   )  CH 4  + ω NH 3      (3) C ∞  H π  O τ  N ω  + Z 1  H 2  O ⇒ Z 2  CO 2  + Z 3  CH 4  + Z 4  NH 3       The values of ∞   , π   , τ   , and ω    were determined using Eq. (4)  (Salami and Susu, 2011 ):(4) Mole ratio = K [ C , H , O , N ]   M [ C , H , O , N ]        where K is the elemental composition of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, obtained from the ultimate analysis of food waste in China (see column 3 of Table A2 ), and M is the molar mass of the elements (see column 4 of Table A2 ). The values of Z 1    , Z 2    , and Z 3     can be calculated using Eqs. (5)–(7) :(5) Z 1  = ( 4 ∞ − π − 2 τ + 3 ω  4      (6) Z 2  = 4 ∞ − π + 2 τ + 3 ω  8      (7) Z 3  = 4 ∞ + π − 2 τ − 3 ω  8       Using AD technology, the volume of potential methane and carbon dioxide that can be produced are obtained using Eqs. (8) and (9) :(8) CH 4  ( m 3  / t  )  = ( Z 3  * 16  ( C m  * ∞  )  + ( H m  *π  )  + ( O m  *τ  )  + N m    )  * 1000  Den ( CH 4  )        (9) C O 2  ( m 3  / t )  = ( Z 2  ∗ 44  ( C m  ∗ ∞  )  + ( H m  ∗ π  )  + ( O m  ∗ τ  )  + N m    )  ∗ 1000  D e n ( C O 2  )         where, C m    , H m    , O m    , and N m     are the molar mass of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, D e n ( C H 4  )      is the density of methane, which is taken as 0.717 kg/m3  (Cudjoe et al., 2020 ), and D e n ( C O 2  )      is the density of carbon dioxide, given as 1.938 kg/m3  (Ogunjuyigbe et al., 2017 ). The total volume of biogas production from the anaerobic digestion process is estimated using Eq. (10) :(10) B i o v  ( t o t a l )   = CH 4  ( m 3  / t  )  + C O 2  ( m 3  / t  )       It is reported that the actual biogas production is lower than the theoretical value. This is because around 10% of feedstock fails to decompose in the digester of the AD technology (Nizami et al., 2013 ). Besides, about 5–10% of the organic matter synthesizes the organisms' cell tissue, affecting microbial degradation. Impurities in the biogas produced should be removed to enable pure bio-methane yield. The chemical composition of pure biogas is 93%–96% of methane, 4%–7% of carbon dioxide, and less than 20 ppm of hydrogen Sulfide (Alves et al., 2013 ). Carbon dioxide is the only impurity considered. From the explanations above, the methane generation potential from purified biogas can be evaluated using Eq. 11 and 12 :(11) C H 4  c l e a n   ( P )   = B i o a c t u a l   ( p )   ∗ μ     (12) B i o a c t u a l   ( p )   = F W ( P )   ∗ 0.85 ∗ B i o v  ( t o t a l )       where 0.85 (85%) is the fraction of organic matter utilized for cell tissue synthesis (Ayodele et al., 2018 ), μ    is the percentage (%) to which the biogas is purified. After purification, theoretical biogas is assumed to be upgraded to 70% methane and 30% carbon dioxide (Ayodele et al., 2019 ). The percentage value to which biogas is purified (μ   ) is taken as 0.7.  3.3 Hydrogen gas production from the process of biogas steam reforming Due to its organic value, biogas is an outstanding biomass origin for hydrogen production (R. García et al., 2021 ). One famous and advanced hydrogen generation method is the steam methane reforming (SMR) process. The process has a conversion efficiency ranging between 74% and 85% (Nikolaidis and Poullikkas, 2017 ) and contributes to around 50% of hydrogen production worldwide (Braga et al., 2013 ). In the reformer, the chemical reactions that take place include steam reforming (C H 4  + H 2  O ↔ C O + 3 H 2    ), water to gas reaction (C O + H 2  O ↔ C O 2  + H 2    ), and combination of the steam reforming and water to gas reactions (C H 4  + 2 H 2  O ↔ C O 2  + 4 H 2    ) (Saebea et al., 2014 ). Based on the combination of steam reforming and water to gas reactions, the process (16 kg of steam reformed methane produces 8 kg of hydrogen gas and 1 kg of steam reformed methane has 0.5 kg of hydrogen gas) can be obtained. Taking account of the methane level, 1 m3  of steam reshaped methane is comparable in kg of hydrogen gas to 0.5 methane density. The hydrogen gas generation potential is based on the boiler and the reformer efficiencies. The generated hydrogen gas is practically stored in a compressed gas cylinder or cryogenic tank as a liquid. For this study, it is assumed that the hydrogen gas is stored in a compressed gas cylinder. Compressed gas is preferred over liquid hydrogen tanks due to the high energy cost to liquefy hydrogen and the loss of range as the cryogenic liquid hydrogen boils off over several days. Compressed gas storage tanks are very large for the relative amount of energy stored (Hochgraf, 2009 ). The volume of compressed hydrogen production is calculated using Eq. (13) :(13) H 2 ( c o m p )    = ( Den ( CH 4  )   ∗ C H 4  c l e a n   ( P )   ∗ 0.5 ∗ B ( e f f  )   ∗ R ( e f f )    )  ∗ 0.95  H 2 ( c o m p )  d e n        where, B ( e f f  )      and R ( e f f )      are the boiler efficiency and the reformer efficiency, and are given as 0.8 (Braga et al., 2013 ), H 2 ( c o m p )    d e n    is the density of the compressed hydrogen gas taken as 36 kg/m3  (Zuttel, 2004 ), and 0.95 is the compression efficiency (Ayodele et al., 2019 ).  3.4 Estimation of electricity production from hydrogen gas via a fuel cell The consumption of clean and sustainable electricity worldwide is possible by using hydrogen gas from the renewable origin as fuel cells (Cook, 2001 ). In this study, it is considered that the chemical energy in the hydrogen gas is transferred to a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC), then it is converted to electricity. This is because PEMFC has a low operating temperature, higher power density, high durability, fast start-up (Ayodele et al., 2019 ), stable membrane, and commercial availability (Bajpai and Dash, 2012 ) relative to other fuel cells such as Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC), Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), and Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) (Saeed and Warrkozek, 2015 ). Using Eq. (14) , the amount of electricity that can be generated from the hydrogen gas is estimated as:(14) E ( g e n )   = H 2 ( L H V )    ∗ 0.6 ∗ H 2 ( c o m p  )    ∗ D H 2       where 0.6 is fuel cells electricity conversion efficiency (Alves et al., 2013 ), H 2 ( L H V )       is the lower heating value of hydrogen gas, which is taken as 33.3 kWh/kg (Dufo-López and Bernal-Agustın, 2008 ), and D H 2      is the density of hydrogen taken as 0.089886 kg/m3  (Ayodele et al., 2019 ). The estimated electricity needs by the provinces and percentage contribution of electricity generation from hydrogen gas to the energy needs were determined using Eqs. (15) and (16) :(15) E ( n e e d  )   = C ( e n e r g y )   × β     (16) τ = E ( g e n )   E ( n e e d  )    × 100     where, C ( e n e r g y )      is the per capita electricity consumption in China from 2004 to 2018 (see Table A3 ), β    is the provinces' population from 2004 to 2018 (see column 2 of Table 3  ), and τ    is the percentage contribution of energy from hydrogen.  3.5 Assessment of environmental benefits This section details the methods employed to determine the environmental benefits of electricity generation from hydrogen gas derived from China's food waste. The environmental benefits analysis was based on coal consumption and greenhouse gas (CH4 , N2 O, and CO2 ) emissions saved. 3.5.1 Amount of coal consumption avoided Electricity, heat production, and supply are China's most significant carbon emission industries. This could be attributed to the dependence on coal as the primary source of electricity production. This accounts for about 80% of China's total electricity production. The application of modern electricity generation technology could minimize carbon emissions (Wei et al., 2017 ). The consumption of electricity from hydrogen gas could lead to the realization of minimized carbon emission by replacing a considerable amount of coal usage. The amount of coal consumption replaced during the period (2004–2018) could be determined using Eq. (17) :(17) S ( c o a l )   = E ( g e n )   D e n ( c o a l )   × C P ( e f f )   × L H V ( c o a l )    α        where, D e n ( c o a l )      is the density of coal and is given as 1100–1800 kg/m3  (The EngineeringToolBox, 2020 ), C P ( e f f )      is the efficiency of the coal power plant in China and is taken as 38.4% (NS Energy, 2019 ), L H V ( c o a l )      is the lower heating value of coal and is taken as 25.86 MJ/kg (Claverton-energy, 2011 ), and α    is the conversion factor from MJ to kWh, which is taken as 3.6. The percentage of coal consumption that could be avoided due to power consumption from hydrogen gas was computed using Eq. 18 and 19 :(18) P C ( c o a l )   = [ S ( c o a l )   S ( p o w e r )    ]  × 100     (19) S ( p o w e r )   = C L ( c o n s u m e )  ×   P C ( p o w e r )       where S ( p o w e r )      is the amount of coal combusted for power generation by the provinces, C L ( c o n s u m e )      is the total amount of coal consumed by the provinces from 2004 to 2018 (see column 2 of Table 4  ), and P C ( p o w e r )      is the average percentage of coal combustion for power generation purposes, given as 80% (Wei et al., 2017 ).  3.5.2 Amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions avoided Coal combustion for electricity generation leads to harmful air pollutants such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (Wei et al., 2017 ). China has been serious about its power grid being decarbonized. As a partner to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, China officially declared to reduce the rate of carbon pollution by 60–65% by 2030 (CMA, 2014 ). The consumption of electricity produced from hydrogen gas derived from biogas could significantly minimize the harmful gas emissions. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide were the only air pollutants considered in this study. This is because of their significant contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions. It is reported that 80% of greenhouse gas emissions come from carbon dioxide, 10% from methane, and 7% from nitrous oxide (EPA, 2019 ). These emissions result from coal combustion, natural gas, and oil (Heydarzadeh et al., 2020 ). The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ), and nitrous oxide (N2 O) emission avoided were calculated using Eq. (20) :(20) E M ( a )   = S ( c o a l )   × E F ( a )       where, E F ( a )      is the emission factor of coal for the air pollutants considered in this study, which are given as 1.88 kg for CO2  (Ministry for the Environment, 2015 ), 0.258 kg for CH4 , 0.0387 kg for N2 O (IPCC, 2006 ), and a    is the pollutant of calculation, which could be CO2 , CH4  or N2 O. Eq. (21)  was utilized to calculate the total carbon footprint in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq).(21) F P ( C )   = ∑  a = 1  n  E M ( a )   × C Q ( a )       where C Q ( a )      is the carbon dioxide equivalency factor of the greenhouse gases, given as 1.0 kg CO2 eq for CO2  (Ayodele et al., 2017 ), 25.0 kg CO2 eq for CH4  (Cudjoe and Han, 2021 ), and 298.0 kg CO2 eq for N2 O (IPCC, 2006 ).    4 Results and discussion The results of the hydrogen production from biogas extracted from China's food waste from 2004 to 2018 are presented and discussed. The results of the electricity generation potential of hydrogen gas from biogas are presented and discussed. The section also details and discusses the amount of coal saved due to electricity consumption from hydrogen. Besides, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ), and nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions avoided due to electricity generation from hydrogen gas is presented and discussed. 4.1 Results 4.1.1 Hydrogen gas production from the process of biogas steam reforming The amount of food waste treated via an anaerobic digestion technique for hydrogen production over the study period was estimated. The purified methane (bio-methane), hydrogen gas, and compressed hydrogen generation potentials from biogas using food waste in China were evaluated. The amount of food waste treated is detailed in Table A1 . The findings of purified methane (bio-methane), hydrogen gas, and compressed hydrogen generation potentials are depicted in Table 2 . It can be seen from column 3 of Table A1  that the total amount of food waste utilized as feedstock for biogas generation was 1370.48 Mt (representing 52.6% of the total waste). At the provincial level, the feedstock used for biogas production was from 3.12 Mt to 164.89 Mt. Column 2 of Table 2  shows the total amount of purified methane obtained from biogas using food waste in the provinces from 2004 to 2018 was 963.76× 10 9     . A careful observation of Table 2  shows that the total amount of hydrogen gas and compressed hydrogen from biogas in China was 221.13 × 10 9    kg (see column 3) and 5835.28 Mm3  (see column 4). The provinces' hydrogen gas and crammed hydrogen generation potential range from 0.50 to 26.60 billion kg and 13.33–702.07 Mm3 . Among the provinces considered in this study, the highest hydrogen generation potential was recorded in Guangdong, while the lowest was in Tibet.  4.1.2 The electricity production from hydrogen gas powered by the fuel cell The electricity generation potential of the hydrogen-powered fuel cell in the provinces was estimated, and the results are presented in Fig. 2  . The results indicate that the total electricity generated from hydrogen in the provinces from 2004 to 2018 was 10,479.72 GWh. The electricity generation potential from hydrogen in China's provinces ranges from 23.93 GWh to 1260.87 GWh. Compared to the other provinces involved in this study, the electricity generation potential in Tibet (23.93 GWh) and Qinghai (45.49 GWh) were the lowest, while that of Guangdong (1260.87 GWh), Jiangsu (710.60 GWh), and Shandong (694.35 GWh) were the highest. The electricity needs of China (see column 3 of Table 3 ) during the period were estimated based on the population of the provinces (see column 2 of Table 3 ) and the per capita electricity consumption of China (see Table A3 ). The findings show that China's total estimated electricity needs from 2004 to 2018 is 8727.74 TWh. The amount of electricity that could be produced from hydrogen could contribute 0.13% to the total electricity needs of China. At the provincial level, electricity from hydrogen contribution to the electricity needs was between 0.06% and 0.33%. The highest contribution of electricity from hydrogen was recorded in Beijing, whiles the lowest was in Guangxi province.  4.1.3 The amount of coal consumption avoided The amount of coal consumption that could be saved due to electricity usage from hydrogen gas in China from 2004 to 2018 was assessed. The results of the assessment are depicted in Fig. 3  . It can be observed from Fig. 3  that the total amount of coal consumption that could be avoided from consuming electricity from hydrogen gas is 616.27 Mt. The coal consumption saving in the provinces during the study period was from 1.41 Mt to 74.15 Mt. The findings from Fig. 3  also shows that the amount of coal consumption saved in Guangdong province (74.15 Mt), Jiangsu province (41.79 Mt), Shandong province (40.83 Mt), and Zhejiang province (37.23 Mt) was the highest. The lowest coal consumption avoided due to electricity production from hydrogen was recorded in Tibet (1.41 Mt), Ningxia (3.87 Mt), and Tianjin (7.33 Mt). According to the total amount of coal consumption (see column 2 of Table 4 ) and the amount of coal combusted for power generation (see column 3 of Table 4 ) during the period, on average, 2.10% of coal combustion was avoided due to power generation from hydrogen gas (see column 4 of Table 4 ). A critical observation of column 4 of Table 4  indicates that the percentage of coal consumption displaced among the province varied from 0.40% to 10.80%. The highest percentage of coal consumption avoided was in Beijing, while the lowest was recorded in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia.  4.1.4 The amount of greenhouse gas emission avoided The emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that can be prevented due to electricity generation from hydrogen gas was evaluated. The GHGs considered were carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ), and nitrous oxide (N2 O). The evaluation of GHG emissions avoided is presented in Fig. 4  , Fig. 5  , and Fig. 6  . From Fig. 4 , it could be seen that the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions avoided in China from 2004 to 2018 was 1159.00 M kg. A critical look at Fig. 4  shows that the carbon dioxide emission avoided in the provinces is between 2.65 M kg and 139.39 M kg. The results from the analysis of GHGs emissions saved further show that a total amount of 159.00 M kg of methane (see Figs. 5 ) and 238.49 thousand kg of nitrous oxide (see Fig. 6 ) emissions from the combustion of coal for electricity production are avoided. Fig. 5  shows that the methane avoided among the provinces ranges from 0.36 M kg to 19.13 M kg, while nitrous oxide (see Fig. 6 ) ranges from 0.54 thousand kg to 28.69 thousand kg. The total carbon footprint displaced due to power generation from hydrogen gas during the period was 76.21 thousand kt CO2 eq.   4.2 Discussions The findings indicated that the amount of food waste collected and utilized as feedstock in the anaerobic digestion process represents more than half of the solid waste produced during the period. This means that as food waste becomes the primary feedstock, a large proportion of the waste generated in China would be frequently collected out of the provinces, sorted, and adequately discharged. This would contribute to meeting the targets set by China to improve their municipal solid waste sorting systems to include all cities and increase waste recovery rate to 65% by 2030 to realize SDG-11.6 and fulfill SDG-11.6.1 set by the United Nations. Using anaerobic digestion technology, the food waste is recycled to produce valuable biogas and hydrogen gas. This has the potential to promote China's target to increase the amount of solid waste recycled annually to 4 × 10 9    t in 2025 and 4.5 × 10 9    t in 2030 as a response to SDG-12.5 and SDG-12.5.1. This substantially contributes to food waste reduction, thereby contributing to the realization of the vow made by China through the Ministry of Ecology and Environment to promote the establishment of “waste-free cities” in about 100 prefecture-level and above cities via steady decline in waste generation by 2025. It was observed that hydrogen generation potential in some provinces was higher than in others. The increased hydrogen potential registered in Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shandong could be attributed to the increased food waste production due to the large population and substantial economic growth. This is consistent with the findings in Ayodele et al. (2019) , which attributed the high hydrogen generation potential in some locations in Nigeria to the vast population and the increased domestic, commercial, and industrial activities. This is consistent with Han et al. (2016)  finding that the food waste to hydrogen project in Hangzhou would shut down if the feedstock (food waste) is below 0.3 t/d. The finding also agrees with Cudjoe et al. (2020) , which attributed the high biogas and methane yield from waste-to-energy projects in provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shandong to the increased waste generation because of population growth and economic development. The result is also in line with the finding in Karaeva (2021)  that the anaerobic digestion facilities fed with the largest quantity of digestate due to the increased amount of agriculture waste produced the highest quantity of hydrogen gas. The results show that a considerable amount of electricity could be generated from hydrogen gas. This agrees with the findings in Ayodele et al. (2019)  that hydrogen from biogas can generate about 19.46 M kWh of electricity in Nigeria from 2017 to 2036. The finding is consistent with Madeira et al. (2021) , who found that the energy efficiency of hydrogen gas from swine manure biogas was 79.06%. The result in this study is in line with the finding in Nam et al. (2021)  that the surplus electricity from Busan's hydrogen achieved from target supply and market potential was 1.77 TWhe  and 6.26 TWhe . The result also sides with the finding in Sharma (2019)  that food waste is a potential source for hydrogen gas production, which benefits energy conversion. According to Marcoberardino et al. (2018) , hydrogen gas obtained from renewable sources could be utilized as an alternative for fossil fuel in power generation with zero emission of harmful pollutants. This encouraging finding means that food waste to hydrogen projects in China could be seen as a viable integrated waste management scheme with clean power generation potential that could serve as a means of displacing fossil fuel. This could significantly contribute to China's target to increase non-fossil energy consumption by 25% by 2030. The present overall percentage contribution of electricity from hydrogen to the estimated energy needs of China is less and must be improved. As more experiences are gained and more commercial plants are constructed with time, the reliability of the technology will increase. This could promote China's target to ensure that not less than 50% of electricity transmitted via newly constructed lines is generated from renewable resources by 2030. The power generation potential of the hydrogen gas was not equally high in all the provinces of China. The lower electricity generation potential in provinces such as Tibet and Qinghai is because of the low amount of feedstock (food waste) utilized in the digester of the AD technology. The low electricity generation in these provinces could also be attributed to less waste generation because of lower population growth. Low waste generation means less food waste will be utilized in the anaerobic digestion process, leading to lower biogas, hydrogen yield, and power generation. Compared to the other provinces in this study, the percentage contribution of power from hydrogen gas to electricity needs in Beijing was the highest. This means that the power from hydrogen gas in Beijing can supply most of the electricity demands of its population compared to the other provinces in this study. At the national level, the findings have clearly shown that a significant amount of coal consumption could be avoided due to electricity usage from hydrogen gas. Compared to other provinces, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang avoided the most significant amount of coal consumption. This is because there was high hydrogen source electricity consumption in these provinces, which avoided a large amount of coal consumption. The findings showed that compared to other provinces in this study, the percentage of coal consumption avoided in Beijing was the highest. This is because the difference between the amount of coal utilized for power generation and the amount of coal displaced by hydrogen source power in Beijing is not as high as the other provinces. The avoidance of coal consumption due to electricity from hydrogen avoided the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is consistent with the findings of Bamisile et al. (2020) , which concluded that hydrogen production with hydropower stations in Southwestern China could reduce China's carbon dioxide emissions by 1.18%. This is in line with Nam et al. (2021)  finding that using hydrogen gas as an alternative to natural gas in South Korea could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 16.80%. The results also agree with Cook (2001)  that fuel cells are environmentally friendly, and their only emission is harmless water vapor. China depends on coal as the primary source of 80% of the country's total power generation. This has remarkably resulted in carbon emission (Wei et al., 2017 ). In June 2015, as a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, China officially announced its commitment to reduce carbon emission intensity by introducing clean electricity generation technologies (CMA, 2014 ). As demonstrated by this study's findings, electricity generation from hydrogen gas will save a considerable amount of coal consumption. This will contribute to the minimization of carbon emissions, thereby promoting the country's target to successfully realize carbon dioxide peak before 2030 via reducing carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65%. Aside from the avoidance of emission of CO2 , the study showed that consumption of hydrogen source electricity could avoid a large amount of CH4  and N2 O emissions. This demonstrates that the involvement of the project in the national climate change strategy will strongly support China's effort to strengthen control over the emissions of methane and other non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases to achieve SDG-13. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are potent greenhouse gases, which contribute strongly to global warming. The prevention of emission of these gases into the atmosphere due to electricity from hydrogen gas is an excellent step towards climate change mitigation. Incorporating hydrogen source electricity into the national climate change combat strategy/plan could lead to low greenhouse gas emissions. The study showed that the greenhouse gas (CO2 , CH4 , and N2 O) emissions in Tibet, Hainan, and Ningxia were low compared to other provinces. This could be attributed to the avoidance of a low amount of coal consumption for power generation in these provinces.   5 Policy recommendations The study's findings show that electricity generation using hydrogen from biogas derived from food waste in China has a great potential to contribute to solid waste management (SDG-12 and SDG-11), clean energy (SDG-7), and climate change mitigation (SDG-13). It was observed from the findings that the percentage contribution of electricity from hydrogen to the estimated energy needs of China is minimal. This could be due to the lower feedstock (food waste) for biogas generation. It is recommended that waste collection rates be increased in all provinces by providing suitable waste collection and transportation infrastructure. All provinces should put a solid institutional structure to guarantee that waste is collected and disposed of properly. Through loans, private waste collectors should be encouraged by empowering public financial institutions to support private waste collection companies. This should be supported by continuous monitoring and assessment to maintain efficiency and professionalism. The study demonstrated that the commercialization of food waste to hydrogen projects at the national and provincial levels could generate a high amount of hydrogen gas. The project is recommended to be marketed at the national and provincial levels by launching markets for items made using energy from hydrogen derived from food waste. Governments should preferentially acquire the steel or other products created sustainably utilizing energy from hydrogen from food waste through public procurement or mandate a significant percentage of such products in the total material mix. Policymakers should develop financing infrastructure to support the popularization of the project. Capital requirements may exceed the operator's capabilities to achieve successful commercialization or major development of the projects, necessitating additional funding from public and private financial sources. Policies should be put in place to encourage capital flows for network development and repurposing. It was found from the study that the valorization of food waste into hydrogen for electricity generation has the potential to displace a huge amount of coal consumption. It was observed from the findings that the amount of coal displaced differs among the provinces. The Chinese government strives to decarbonize the country's coal-dominated electricity generation by implementing contemporary electricity generation technology. It is recommended that a high-level strategy and roadmap for developing food waste hydrogen to electricity projects at the provincial levels be established. This should be according to the provinces' geographical, economic, and commercial advantages. The strategies should fit with the overall decarbonization strategy and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) in line with climate change mitigation actions in China. The findings indicated that a higher amount of GHG emissions could be avoided due to the consumption of electricity from hydrogen derived from food waste. There should be an adaption of industrial policy for valorizing food waste into hydrogen. Governments should ensure that there are policies to encourage fuel switches, rather than focusing on marginal gains, which are insufficient to reach net-zero emissions on their own. This might be accomplished, for example, by establishing high long-term objectives for reducing GHG emissions per industrial type that cannot be met only via energy efficiency and include food waste valorization into hydrogen in the supported technologies.  6 Conclusions and limitations The present study assessed the energy and environmental benefits of electricity generation of hydrogen from biogas derived from food waste in 31 provinces of China from 2004 to 2018. The findings show that a total of 221.13 × 10 9    kg of hydrogen was generated, which could produce 10,479.72 GWh of power. The contribution of electricity from biogas source hydrogen gas to the estimated energy needs in China is 0.13%. The lower percentage contribution of electricity makes its contribution towards the realization of SDG-7.1 and SDG-7.2 extremely low. The amount of coal consumption avoided (616.27 Mt) due to power consumption from hydrogen gas could reduce coal consumption in China by 2.10%. The amount of CO2 , CH4 , and N2 O emissions avoided from getting into the ambient due to consumption of power from hydrogen was 1159.00 M kg, 159.00 M kg, and 238.49 thousand kg. It was found that 76.21 thousand kt CO2 eq of the carbon footprint was displaced due to avoidance of coal combustion for power generation during the period. The environmental benefits of food waste hydrogen gas to energy project in China has a significant contribution towards the achievement of SDG-13.2. The present study considered the power generation potentials and ecological benefits of hydrogen to energy projects but did not include its economic feasibility assessment. The project's robust economic feasibility and financial analysis will be investigated in future studies.
