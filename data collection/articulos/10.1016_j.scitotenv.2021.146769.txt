                  Reservoirs account for about 10% of the freshwater stored in lakes worldwide. These reservoirs are home to ‘reservoir ecosystems’, that is, the aquatic and non-aquatic interactive ecosystems associated with artificial lakes where water is stored, typically behind a dam, for human purposes. While reservoir ecosystems provide various ecosystem services for sustainable development, their significance in research and policy has not been well understood and not well defined in the 2030 United Nation's (UN) Agenda for Sustainable Development. To advance understanding of reservoir ecosystems and their impact on policy, here we provide an overview of research on reservoir ecosystems and link it to UN SDGs and their Targets. Based on 5280 articles published in the last three decades, we applied network visualization to construct a framework for research addressing reservoir ecosystems. The framework covers four major themes: (1) ecosystem structure and function, (2) environmental pollution and stress effects, (3) climate impacts and ecological feedbacks, and (4) ecosystem services and management. We have found that sustainable reservoir ecosystems synergistically support 121 Targets of UN SDGs (71% of all). Reservoir ecosystems have both negative and positive implications for 15 targets (9%) and negative trade-offs for only 3 targets (2%). Thirty SDG Targets (18%) are unrelated to sustainable reservoir ecosystems. The synergies and trade-offs exist in three fields, securing basic material needs (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 14 and 15), pursuing common human well-being (SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10), and coordinating sustainable governance policies (SDGs 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17). Exploring these linkages allows better integration of reservoir ecosystems into the UN SDGs framework and guides sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems for sustainable development.

These reservoirs are home to ‘reservoir ecosystems’, that is, the aquatic and non-aquatic interactive ecosystems associated with artificial lakes where water is stored, typically behind a dam, for human purposes. While reservoir ecosystems provide various ecosystem services for sustainable development, their significance in research and policy has not been well understood and not well defined in the 2030 United Nation's (UN) Agenda for Sustainable Development. To advance understanding of reservoir ecosystems and their impact on policy, here we provide an overview of research on reservoir ecosystems and link it to UN SDGs and their Targets. Based on 5280 articles published in the last three decades, we applied network visualization to construct a framework for research addressing reservoir ecosystems. The framework covers four major themes: (1) ecosystem structure and function, (2) environmental pollution and stress effects, (3) climate impacts and ecological feedbacks, and (4) ecosystem services and management. We have found that sustainable reservoir ecosystems synergistically support 121 Targets of UN SDGs (71% of all). Reservoir ecosystems have both negative and positive implications for 15 targets (9%) and negative trade-offs for only 3 targets (2%). Thirty SDG Targets (18%) are unrelated to sustainable reservoir ecosystems. The synergies and trade-offs exist in three fields, securing basic material needs (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 14 and 15), pursuing common human well-being (SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10), and coordinating sustainable governance policies (SDGs 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17). Exploring these linkages allows better integration of reservoir ecosystems into the UN SDGs framework and guides sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems for sustainable development.

The variability of available water resources has made human demands for water supply increasingly dependent on reservoirs storage, especially in regions where water is scarce and variable (Hall et al., 2014 ). After nearly hundred years of developments, most countries in Europe and North America have entered the post-dam era, but many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America have set off a new wave of dam constructions (Zarfl et al., 2015 ). Globally, approximately 58,000 large reservoirs with dams higher than 15 m have been constructed, with a cumulative storage capacity of 7000 to 8300 km3 , accounting for about 10% of the natural freshwater lake storage capacity (Lehner et al., 2011 ; Mulligan et al., 2020 ). Reservoir construction has altered fluvial morphology, hydrological and water quality characteristics, and ecological environments significantly on the regional and even global scales (Xu et al., 2011 ). Dam construction also creates ‘reservoir ecosystems’ behind the dam wall, which we define here as aquatic and non-aquatic interactive ecosystems associated with artificial lakes created behind dams. At the end of last century, these artificial ecosystems were present in over half of river systems around the world, and by 2030, it is predicted that, they will be present in 90% of rivers worldwide (Van Cappellen and Maavara, 2016 ). As the human impact on aquatic ecosystems increases, it becomes essential to understand the extent to which reservoir ecosystems can contribute to sustainable development. Given humanity's increasing dependence on reservoirs and related ecosystem services, a prerequisite for taking into account future sustainability of structure and function of the reservoir ecosystem itself is to regard reservoirs as complete ecosystems and to regulate the reservoir ecology based on an ecosystem management perspective. While economic drivers of most reservoirs are well documented, experiences of dam constructions globally have taught us that traditional management concepts focus only on maximizing economic benefits, which fundamentally fragment the integrity of reservoir ecosystems (Poff et al., 2015 ). For instance, cost-benefit analyses that underestimate the loss of ecosystem functions and services (Brown et al., 2009 ; Pearce et al., 2006 ), minimum environmental flows that are allocated only to secure fisheries (Poff and Matthews, 2013 ), and dam designs that lack sustainable sediment management (Kondolf and Farahani, 2018 ) make it difficult to reconcile conflict among stakeholders and do not help maintain ecosystem connectivity. Hence, applying ecosystem theory to understand the structure, functions, and processes of reservoir ecosystems is the foundation for social, economic, and environmental balance and is the basic framework for supporting management strategies of reservoir ecosystems (Jones et al., 2019 ). Reservoir ecosystems are subject to various, sometimes conflicting pressures of supply and demand and their structures, functions and processes are intricately linked to watersheds as well as anthropogenic regulation. This means that sustainable reservoir management requires cross-sectoral, cross-scale and interdisciplinary insights and supporting solutions (CGIAR Research Program on Water, 2017 ). Here, we investigate whether a more comprehensive and sustainable management strategy is possible to guide the development of these complex, artificial ecosystems, in order to avoid further degradation and negative impacts. As a programmatic document to guide global sustainable development over the next decade, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed within the 2030 United Nation's (UN) Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015 ) present new opportunities for global sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems. Each of the 17 SDGs, also known as the Global Goals, has 5–19 specific “Targets” (169 total) associated with them. The Global Goals and their Targets are applicable to all countries and their implementation marks the beginning of a new era of sustainable development. The Global Goals, which couple social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, aim to address challenges of poverty, inequality, aquatic/terrestrial ecosystems degradation, resources scarcity, urbanization, climate change, peace, and cooperation through concerted actions. In this Review, we summarize the status and trends of research on reservoir ecosystems over the past 30 years through keyword co-occurrence network analysis, and discuss the evolution of main research themes. Based on the themes of reservoir ecosystem research, we analyze the interlinkages between reservoir ecosystems and the SDGs. We illustrate the synergies or trade-offs between the sustainable development of reservoir ecosystem and the achievement of the 169 Targets of the 17 SDGs. Given these interlinkages, we emphasize the urgent need to integrate reservoir ecosystems into the sustainable development agenda, both to support action on the SDGs and to provide guidance for the sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems.  2 Data source and methodology A search on Clarivate's Web of Science Core Collection was performed for literature published on the topic of “(‘reservoir*’) AND (‘ecosystem*’ OR ‘ecolog* system*’ OR ‘eco-system’)” from 1900 to 2019. The title, abstract, and keywords of the literature were topic search fields (Mao et al., 2018 ) and the literature type was limited to original research articles and reviews. Of these, the earliest literature on the theme retrieved was published in 1974 (Ward, 1974 ), and only 0.3% of the total number of papers were published before 1989. In our search, we therefore adjusted the time span to 1990–2019. To further ensure the relevance of the selected literature to the topic, we conducted an exhaustive manual screening of the search results and eliminated apparently unrelated or duplicate records. The final 5280 records included keywords, publication year, and reference lists of each publication, which were exported in plain text format and used as a text dataset for subsequent analysis (Text dataset is available from this Supplementary material). The software BibExcel was applied to extract the keywords frequency from the text dataset (Persson et al., 2009 ). After capturing these data, we carefully checked again for incorrect or duplicate information. Synonyms, acronyms, and different tenses of different keywords were integrated into single terms and their frequencies of were recalculated. Some proper nouns (e.g., names of rivers, reservoirs, lakes, places, and countries), initial search terms (“reservoir”, “ecosystem”, “system”, and “ecology”), meaningless prepositional or imperative phrases were directly deleted from the keywords list. Keywords are terms that reflect the core idea and topic of the article and their occurrence frequencies are indicative of the current state of the research field (Xu and Boeing, 2013 ). Accordingly, the keywords with word frequency ≥ 5 were grouped using the Ward's minimum variance algorithm in agglomerative hierarchical clustering to divide the study period into three stages: 1990–2006 (Stage 1), 2007–2014 (Stage 2) and 2015–2019 (Stage 3) (Fig. S1). In order to visualize the trends and frontiers of reservoir ecosystems research, we carried out keyword analysis with VOSviewer, a text mining tool that quantitatively evaluates previous studies and uses community detection algorithms for network clustering (van Eck and Waltman, 2010 ). We constructed a keyword co-occurrence network and clustered keywords (Padilla et al., 2018 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). In the generated clustering network map, color and size of nodes and thickness of connecting lines between nodes represent clustering category, keyword frequency, and strength of keyword co-occurrence, respectively. The similarity between nodes is measured by the Euclidian distance. A closer distance indicates a greater degree of similarity.  3 The framework for reservoir ecosystems research Based on the keyword clustering network, we have identified four major themes of reservoir ecosystems research over the last 30 years: (1) ecosystem structure and function, (2) environmental pollution and stress effects, (3) climate impacts and ecological feedbacks, and (4) ecosystem services and management (Fig. 1  ). The dual pressures of increasing human activities and climate change present unique and unprecedented challenges for the structure and function of reservoir ecosystems. Anthropogenic pollution inputs and excessive human demands on water resources endanger the stability of reservoir ecosystems (Jackson et al., 2001 ). Constantly improving ecosystem management attempts to prevent and control pollution to maintain the overall value of reservoir ecosystems and continue to provide services for future generations. Notably, reservoirs for water storage and power generation play an important role in the global carbon cycle, securing energy needs while positively or negatively influencing climate change (Hecht et al., 2019 ). In short, there are interdependencies and mutual constraints among the four major themes illustrated by the keyword clustering network analysis and full consideration of these cascades can help to construct a multidimensional framework for reservoir ecosystems research. The focus and interest of the reservoir related research has changed over time. We divide research output into three stages (1990–2006, 2007–2014, 2015–2019) and find that while the high-frequency keywords in the three research stages remained the same, the frequency, the spatial location, and the clustering groups of the keywords varied with the different research stages (Fig. S2). The number of research nodes in the three stage gradually increased, and research cross-fertilizations among topics (clusters) was significantly enhanced, indicating that connections among the four major themes deepened over time with the expanding of research fields. At the theoretical research level, the fast and dynamic development of advanced technologies such as gene sequencing has provided the possibility for expansion of basic theoretical research themes (e.g., ecosystem structure, pollutant transformation mechanisms) to more modern microlevel domains. Furthermore, big data and the introduction of geospatial technologies have led to the broadening of the spatial-temporal scope of macrolevel themes, such as climate change and ecosystem management and their increasing prevalence in reservoir ecosystems research. In general, the scope of classical research on reservoir ecosystems has been refined and expanded advancing from the local (micro) and theoretical research to global (macro) and applied scales. Next, we examine the four major research themes identified through the keyword clustering network. 3.1 Ecosystem structure and function. Ecosystem structure and function is a classic theme in the field of reservoir ecosystems research, and this cluster is composed of high-frequency keywords such as “water quality”, “eutrophication”, “phytoplankton”, “biomass”, “nutrients”, and “algal blooms” (Green cluster; Fig. 1 ). Water quality problems caused by reservoir eutrophication and algal blooms are a continuing focus of this theme. Reservoir ecosystems are characterized by integrity and their structures and functions respond to stressors in a contrasting or complementary manner (von Schiller et al., 2017 ). Eutrophication is a process in which excessive nutrient loading in reservoirs triggers phytoplankton biomass blooms and community imbalances, thereby destroying ecosystem function and leading to water quality degradation (Gamez et al., 2019 ; Smith, 2003 ). The most typical sign of water eutrophication is an algal bloom, and mitigating the global spread of algal blooms is an urgent environmental and human health issue. Exploring key drivers of algal blooms and predicting their occurrence at multidimensional scales provides opportunities for effective control in areas requiring priority attention and mitigation (Janssen et al., 2019 ). Keyword frequency related to ecosystem structure and function began to decline in 2015, indicating that this subfield of basic research has matured and is saturated, and other related researches is gradually deepening. At the end of the last century, the awareness of eutrophication has prompted numerous studies focusing on the intrinsic relationship among eutrophication, nutrients, and algae blooms (Correll, 1998 ; Levich, 1996 ; Vădineanu et al., 1992 ). Since 2007, the occurrence of keywords such as microcystins and cyanotoxins has indicated that attention is focusing on the water quality hazards caused by harmful algal blooms and their phycotoxins (Fig. S2). In particular, the formation of harmful algal blooms presents one of the most adverse effects of eutrophication on reservoir ecosystems, and the release of phycotoxins has caused a major challenge to water quality protection and water safety (Brooks et al., 2016 ; Gamez et al., 2019 ; Rastogi et al., 2014 ). Yet, eutrophication is continuing to increase in scale and severity and so is the probability, magnitude, and duration of harmful algal blooms (O'Neil et al., 2012 ). Microcystins, one of the most common and considered most dangerous species of cyanotoxins, are harmful to biological and human health through accumulation and transmission within food web (Pham and Utsumi, 2018 ). However, transport and bioaccumulation of phycotoxins in reservoir ecosystems are not triggered by a single environmental variable and taking the comprehensive effects of biotic and abiotic factors and their interactions into account remains the focus of current research (Pham and Utsumi, 2018 )  3.2 Environmental pollution and stress effects The theme of environmental pollution and stress effects is mainly concerned with assessing the ecological impact and apportioning sources of compound pollution in various environmental media (e.g., water, sediment). The cluster consists of the keywords “water”, “sediment”, “heavy-metals”, “antimicrobial resistance”, “bioaccumulation”, and “stable isotopes” (Yellow cluster; Fig. 1 ). The continuous consumption and anthropogenic release of chemicals have threatened the environmental media in reservoirs due to their unexpected or unknown biological activities and even have potential toxic effects on human health. In terms of pollutant types, heavy metals are remarkable among the pollutants due to their high toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation effects (Ye et al., 2011 ). For example, China has made great efforts to reduce water pollution in the last decade, but heavy metal pollution in its lakes and reservoirs is still getting worse (Huang et al., 2019 ). Like heavy metals, antibiotics are naturally occurring compounds, and are most commonly found and detected in freshwater ecosystems due to their global production and consumption (Eckert et al., 2018 ). The misuse of antibiotics can result in an increase of antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment, and drinking water sources can serve as conduit for the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to humans (von Wintersdorff et al., 2016 ). Additionally, waterborne diseases caused by emerging contaminants such as antibiotics, drug-resistant and pathogenic microorganisms pose a significant threat to reservoir ecosystems and public health. While earlier research focused on specific pollutants in a single environmental medium, current research themes have shifted to ecological effects of multimedia compound pollution and their transformation mechanisms (Peng et al., 2014 ; Solomon et al., 1996 ). The transformation of this field can be attributed to the applications of modern techniques and research tools such as stable isotopes tracing and metagenome sequencing. Although we have witnessed great efforts to mitigate ecosystem pollution in the past decades, the levels and trends of reservoir contamination remain disturbing (Palansooriya et al., 2019 ; Sunardi et al., 2020 ). To a large extent, this is due to the multitudinous pollutants present and the fact that more and novel inorganic, organic, and microbial pollutants are constantly being added. It is rather difficult to identify new key pollutants and assess their overall ecological effects with limited efforts and resources and in the absence of uniform monitoring objectives and environmental control standards. The interaction of multimedia compound pollution, anthropogenic disturbances, and climate change have greatly altered the transformation pathways of contaminants between environmental media, which increases the uncertainty of source apportionment and the complexity of ecological effects (Ma et al., 2016 ; Vorosmarty et al., 2013 ).  3.3 Climate impact and ecological feedbacks The climate impact and ecological feedbacks theme contains the keywords “climate change”, “impact”, “land use”, “carbon cycle”, and “model” (Blue cluster; Fig. 1 ). This theme places special emphasis on the use of models to quantitatively assess the impacts of climate change on reservoir ecosystems and reveals the mechanisms of impacts and feedbacks centered on land use and the carbon cycle. Land use changes resulting from reservoir construction can exacerbate the effects of climate change on the water cycle of reservoir ecosystems. Inundation of lowland, land expropriation and deforestation during dam construction and reservoir filling often change original land use patterns and increase the probability of soil erosion and accompanying degradation of the ecosystem (Zhao et al., 2013 ). Land use changes drive the alteration in watershed hydrology, including precipitation, evaporation and flow, which alter the natural watershed runoff and nutrient cycles, thereby affecting the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources (Carpenter et al., 2011 ; Shen et al., 2013 ). The effects of land use change on the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and the water environment increase the instability of the climate system, thus in turn threatening the security of structure and function of reservoir ecosystems. The effects of climate change on the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of reservoir ecosystems are manifested in water temperature and runoff. Reservoir warming and change in runoff may reduce dissolved oxygen content, thermocline depth, and mixing dynamics, thus disturbing the carbon cycle and food web structure of reservoir ecosystems (Sahoo and Schladow, 2010 ). Reduced ecological niche and habitat availability for aquatic organisms, declining fish production, permanent stratification of water bodies, and degradation of water quality are all specific responses of reservoir ecosystems to climate change (Gerling et al., 2016 ; Jeppesen et al., 2010 ; Woolway et al., 2020 ). To quantify and evaluate reservoir ecosystem feedbacks to future climate change, future scenarios are typically simulated by integrating climate change models with precipitation-runoff hydrological models (Borgomeo et al., 2018 ; Muttiah and Wurbs, 2002 ; Nazemi and Wheater, 2015 ; Wen et al., 2018 ). Current modeling assessments and predictions remain subject to significant uncertainty due to the complexity of influencing factors and feedback mechanisms, as well as limitations in data and method availability (Fletcher et al., 2019 ). This poses a challenge to adaptive management of dam infrastructure. Enhancing application of remote sensing and modeling technologies throughout the life-cycle of reservoirs allows for better simulation of climate impacts and in situ monitoring of feedback from reservoir ecosystems. The carbon cycle is the key mechanism linking reservoir ecosystems with the climate through positive and negative feedbacks. Positive and negative feedbacks refer to reservoirs as carbon sink and carbon source to the climate system, respectively. Hydropower is considered a low-carbon, clean energy source with significant positive effects in slowing down the global greenhouse effect (Song et al., 2018 ). In contrast to natural rivers and lakes, carbon buried in reservoir sediments is much larger (Phyoe and Wang, 2019 ). However, over the last 30 years, a growing number of studies have documented both positive and negative impact of reservoirs on global warming (Duchemin et al., 1995 ; Ollivier et al., 2019 ; St Louis et al., 2000 ). Whether a reservoir is a carbon sink or a carbon source depends on factors such as the reservoir age, latitude, reservoir flooded area, land use type, climatic conditions, and aquatic primary productivity (Deemer et al., 2016 ; Phyoe and Wang, 2019 ). In terms of acting as carbon sinks, reservoir sediments can bury endogenous terrestrial organic matter and endogenous organic carbon formed by phytoplankton through photosynthesis for a long time, especially in medium-aged reservoirs located at high latitudes or in temperate regions and with low soil carbon content in reservoir flooded areas (Dean and Gorham, 1998 ; Phyoe and Wang, 2019 ; Soumis et al., 2004 ). In terms of carbon source effects, the decomposition of soil and biological organic matter in reservoir flooded areas, soil erosion, and the mineralization of terrestrial organic matter from intensified are important sources of greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide and methane). This process is particularly evident in early stages of reservoir operation in the humid tropics (Abril et al., 2005 ; Clow et al., 2015 ; Phyoe and Wang, 2019 ). Clearing terrestrial vegetation before reservoir filling, reducing nutrient input, and increasing the capability to produce energy of hydropower projects have all been found significant to reduce carbon emission intensity (Almeida et al., 2019 ). Although overall reservoirs tend to emit greenhouse gases over a certain spatiotemporal range, there is still no consensus on their actual contribution to the global greenhouse effect (Maavara et al., 2020 ). It is essential to estimate greenhouse gases emissions from reservoirs over their entire life cycle on a global scale to confirm whether the reservoir carbon cycle is generally a positive or negative feedback loop to the climate system. Current studies have been conducted using Life Cycle Assessment to quantify and compare greenhouse gas fluxes from reservoirs (Briones Hidrovo et al., 2017 ; Song et al., 2018 ). Yet, lack of long-term monitoring data and difficulty of quantifying emissions from some process indicators make it difficult to measure reservoir life-cycle emissions accurately. To better build and operate reservoirs respond to future climate change and human demands, a more comprehensive understanding of environmental impacts and pollution mechanisms of reservoir ecosystems is needed.  3.4 Ecosystem services and management Ecosystem services and management is a multi-disciplinary research theme that integrates ecological, and social-economic issues and includes keywords “management”, “ecosystem services”, “biodiversity”, “dams”, and “environmental flows” (Red cluster; Fig. 1 ). Maintaining human well-being and enhancing ecosystem services are overarching objectives of reservoir ecosystems management. Ecosystem services and biodiversity are synergistic (Schneiders et al., 2012 ) and reservoir ecosystems management that emphasizes only ecosystem services often ignores or underestimates the intrinsic value of biodiversity (Haines-Young and Potschin, 2010 ; Oliver et al., 2015 ). Current cutting-edge research focuses on comprehensive quantification of ecosystem services that include the utility value of biodiversity. Dam construction has altered natural flow regimes, thereby reduced biodiversity and compromised some ecosystem services (Harrison et al., 2014 ; Wu et al., 2019 ). Overall, maintaining reasonable environmental flows and ecosystem services are key concerns in the management of reservoir ecosystems. In the last 30 years, the perspective of reservoir ecosystem management research has shifted from pollution control and remediation to environmental flow operation and ecosystem service management. The early research on localized pollution control and remediation occurred between 1990 and 2006 and was characterized by the closely linked keywords “management”, “pollution”, and “restoration” (Fig. S2(a)). Reducing exogenous inputs to control common problems such as eutrophication and heavy metal pollution was and still is a priority for reservoir ecosystems management. Wetlands can be powerful tools in ecological engineering to control pollution and this technique is supported by the United States Best Management Practices (Tilton et al., 2019 ). Since the 1980s, artificial wetlands have been widely used to reduce non-point source pollution into natural aquatic systems and reservoirs. This technology has shown to have economic and ecological benefits (Shutes, 2001 ). Depending on structural characteristics of reservoir ecosystems, a combination of bioremediation technologies and biomanipulation can control endogenous pollution loading while reducing exogenous inputs (Tátrai et al., 2005 ). Incorporating artificial wetlands as mentioned above is the most common bioremediation technology, while biomanipulations aim at altering the internal food-web structure to minimize algae biomass. For point source pollution, centralized treatment of sewage is the most common and successful approach. Following pollution control and remediation research, the importance of environmental flow management has been increasing recognized over the past ten years. Environmental flows are the temporal changes of water quantity and quality of an ecosystem and their management aims to assess flow thresholds and restore natural flow regimes for reservoir ecosystems health (Gopal, 2016 ; He et al., 2018 ). Environmental flows management maximizes reservoir ecosystem services for human benefits and balances social, and economic demands while supporting basic ecological protection of the entire watersheds including their reservoirs. Quantifying responses of reservoir ecosystems flow on the watershed scale is helpful to determine priorities of reservoir flow operation research in future (Gillespie et al., 2015 ). Reservoir operation optimization models have been widely used in recent years as they can reconcile conflicts between ecosystems and human needs and provide multiple alternative strategies for flow regime management and reservoir operation (Tsai et al., 2015 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Managing reservoir ecosystems at the watershed scale to optimize ecosystem services is an emerging area of reservoir ecosystems management research (Fig. S2(c)). Since 2005, when the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment discerned strong positive correlations between ecosystem services and human well-being (MEA, 2005 ), ecosystem services have started to be valued as a key support mechanism to meet human needs. As previously mentioned, climate change has a significant impact on both quantity and quality of ecosystem service provisions of reservoirs. The integration of climate change impacts on ecosystem services into reservoir ecosystems management is an important research direction. The effective integration of ecosystem services with environmental protection into ecosystem management practice remains a challenge in this field. Enhancing synergies and trade-offs among various ecosystem services (provisioning, supporting, regulating and cultural services) will facilitate optimal management decisions (Janssen et al., 2020 ).   4 Reservoir ecosystems and the UN SDGs To assess the linkages between reservoir ecosystems and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we elaborate on two aspects: (1) the necessity to analyze reservoir ecosystems within the SDGs system; and (2) a critical assessment of synergies and trade-offs between the two based on published evidence (See Table S1  for the published evidence). For (1), it is important to elucidate contributions and impacts of reservoir ecosystems to the SDGs, in order to highlight the significance of including reservoir ecosystems into the SDGs system for both. For (2), we demonstrate that reservoir ecosystems are linked to all 17 SDGs. We then explored linkages among the 169 specific Targets of the SDGs to reservoir ecosystems and distinguish between synergies (implementation of Targets impact reservoir ecosystems positively; e.g., sustainable management and consumption) and trade-offs (unreasonable implementation Targets impact reservoir ecosystems negatively; e.g., access to adequate food and drinking water). Following the classification of SDGs by Fu et al. (2019)  and Sachs et al. (2019) , we summarize and classify synergies and trade-offs between reservoir ecosystems and SDGs into three domains: securing basic material needs, pursuing common human well-being, and coordinating sustainable governance policies (Fig. 2 a). We found synergies between reservoir ecosystems and Targets 71% of the time (121 Targets). Fifteen Targets (9%) were both positively and negatively impacted by reservoirs and in 2% of cases (3 Targets) we found that reservoirs only had trade-offs for SDGs (Fig. 2 b). The remaining 30 Targets (18%) were unrelated to reservoir ecosystems. To assess the linkages between reservoir ecosystems and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we elaborate on two aspects: (1) the necessity to analyze reservoir ecosystems within the SDGs system; and (2) a critical assessment of synergies and trade-offs between the two based on published evidence (See Table S1 for the published evidence). For (1), it is important to elucidate contributions and impacts of reservoir ecosystems to the SDGs, in order to highlight the significance of including reservoir ecosystems into the SDGs system for both. For (2), we demonstrate that reservoir ecosystems are linked to all 17 SDGs. We then explored linkages among the 169 specific Targets of the SDGs to reservoir ecosystems and distinguish between synergies (implementation of Targets impact reservoir ecosystems positively; e.g., sustainable management and consumption) and trade-offs (unreasonable implementation Targets impact reservoir ecosystems negatively; e.g., access to adequate food and drinking water). Following the classification of SDGs by Fu et al. (2019)  and Sachs et al. (2019) , we summarize and classify synergies and trade-offs between reservoir ecosystems and SDGs into three domains: securing basic material needs, pursuing common human well-being, and coordinating sustainable governance policies (Fig. 2 a). We found synergies between reservoir ecosystems and Targets 71% of the time (121 Targets). Fifteen Targets (9%) were both positively and negatively impacted by reservoirs and in 2% of cases (3 Targets) we found that reservoirs only had trade-offs for SDGs (Fig. 2 b). The remaining 30 Targets (18%) were unrelated to reservoir ecosystems. 4.1 Reservoir ecosystems within the SDGs system  Reservoir ecosystems provide the basic material security of water, food, and energy in direct support of the UN SDGs and contribute to global economic growth and human health and well-being. Population growth and its increased demand for water, food, and energy (SDGs 2, 6, and 7) is actually the main driver for reservoir constructions (Chen et al., 2016 ). Large reservoirs hold approximately 37% of annual continental runoff (Eriyagama et al., 2020 ), support at least 42% of global irrigation water use (Hanasaki et al., 2018 ) and 16% of food production (FAO, 2007 ), and provide nearly 16% of total electricity generation (REN21, 2019 ). The availability of water resources is critical to every sustainable development activity; for example, reducing the spread of infectious diseases (Bain et al., 2014 ) and increasing irrigation opportunities to lift people out of poverty (Lipton et al., 2003 ). However, there are significant temporal and spatial variations in the global distribution of water resources, which do not necessarily overlap with time and regions of human activities. Compared with natural rivers, construction of reservoirs has effectively improved spatiotemporal distribution regulation and management of water sources by humans (Shi et al., 2019 ), thereby reducing the difficulty and cost of water extraction and improving the livelihoods of economically marginalized groups (Hurford and Harou, 2014 ). Besides, flow regulation at dams can reduce the number of people affected by flooding by nearly two million per year (Boulange et al., 2021 ). Services provided by reservoir ecosystems (water, food and energy) synergistically contribute to urbanization and industrialization, with transformative impacts on national economies, health status and human well-being (SDGs 1, 3, 8 and 11) (Chen et al., 2016 ; Staupe-Delgado, 2019 ; Uen et al., 2018 ). In addition, access to clean water and energy plays an important role in promoting education and gender equality and in reducing any other form of inequality (SDGs 4, 5 and 10) (Owusu, 2010 ; Sovacool and Ryan, 2016 ; UNDESA, 2015 ). The sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems is key to the protection and restoration of the land-freshwater-ocean continuum and other natural resources. Reservoirs form an integral link between terrestrial ecosystems and oceans (SDGs 14 and 15) through which materials circulate and energy flows (Maavara et al., 2020 ; Xenopoulos et al., 2017 ). Ecosystem structure and function influence the global carbon cycle and climate change (Hessen and Kaartvedt, 2014 ), and their integrity contributes to climate change mitigation (Martin and Watson, 2016 ). In terms of flood control, reservoir-based hydropower infrastructures (SDG 9) have reduced economic losses in agriculture by up to 84% and climate-related natural disasters (SDG13) by 25% (FAO, 2015 ), thereby maintaining biodiversity and preserving natural habitats. Protected areas or scenic areas formed by reservoir ecosystems can provide recreation and promote physical and mental health, which increases rural economic development (Yin and Xiao, 2019 ). In a wider sense, the regulating and cultural services provided by ecosystems formed by reservoirs in combination with nature contribute to the resilience and adaptability of cities (SDG 11). Moreover, construction of these large infrastructures is an important factor in sustaining social stability (SDG 16) and economic development (Shi et al., 2019 ). A deeper understanding of the positive role of reservoir ecosystems supporting various SDGs will help advance the SDGs progress. Despite reservoir ecosystems contributing to the achievement of SDGs, a lack of awareness of these ecosystems in implementing SDGs could jeopardize the protection of reservoir ecosystems and their services. Degradation of ecosystem structure and function, environmental pollution, climate change, and mismanagement all severely affect reservoir ecosystem services. Drivers like human population growth, urbanization, and economic growth as well as complex ecological feedbacks and interactions across spatial-temporal scales add uncertainty and will be integral to combining social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Unsustainable ecosystem services will undermine access to human well-being and thus threaten implementation of SDGs (Janssen et al., 2020 ). Therefore, how to manage reservoir ecosystems, reduce potential negative impacts, and move towards achieving the milestones laid out by UN's sustainable development activities is a pressing issue. Analyses of linkages between reservoir ecosystems and SDGs aims to provide a systematic guidance for the sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems under the SDGs system.  4.2 Interlinkages between reservoir ecosystems and SDGs 4.2.1 Ensuring basic material needs Reservoir ecosystems provide a foundation for sustainable development activities but alter terrestrial-marine ecosystems dynamics. In the SDGs, a series of actions for water, food, energy and natural resources (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 14, and 15) are key to our ability to maintain reservoir ecosystem services and achieve sustainable development. SDG 6 states the importance to safeguard water quality and quantity and to protect freshwater ecosystems. Its implementation would facilitate pollution control and reduce supply pressures on reservoir ecosystems. Most industrial production activities consume large amounts of water and energy, and improving efficiency and reducing waste is a prerequisite for controlling material demands and reducing environmental pollution (Schwabe et al., 2020 ; UNIDO, 2019 ). Efficient use and recycling of resources as well as the development of novel industrial technologies can reduce the waste of resources such as water and food throughout their life cycle. Moreover, revisiting economic and engineering methodologies for assessing costs and benefits of resource investments, wastewater treatment, and recycling can further reduce environmental pollution loads and increase economic efficiency and welfare (Sadoff et al., 2020 ). The SDGs promote everyone's right to safe drinking water, sanitation, food, and energy resources (Target 2.1, 6.1, 6.2 and 7.1). This means that actions related to food, water, and energy need not only to maintain equity, but also weigh and manage reservoir ecosystem services. The demands for water, food, and energy are highly interconnected and mis-managing any part may be threatening to ecosystems (Fuso Nerini et al., 2017 ). Ecosystem management often involves transboundary pollution at regional and national levels (Howells et al., 2013 ), increasing political, social, cultural, and economic conflicts over production and consumption, which in turn are not conducive to regional security and social peace. Inclusive and integrated management policies focusing on sustainable development (Target 6.5, 14.4, 14.7, and 15.7) must be implemented to overcome independent operation modes of food, water, energy, and other system in order to harmonize basic needs at all levels and achieve win-win solutions in the context of sustainable development. Protecting and restoring ecosystems (Target 2.4, 6.6; SDGs 14 and 15) is essential to maintain and sustainable manage reservoir resources and diversity of ecosystem services. It requires involvement of a wide range of stakeholders throughout the management process as well as communication and cooperation at different scales. Provision of financial and technical assistance to developing countries to build additional modern hydropower reservoirs (Target 6.a and 7.b) and mitigate environmental damage from their construction and operation, or multilateral cooperation in transboundary water resource management to negotiate the needs of all parties, is expected to improve human and ecosystem health.  4.2.2 Pursuing common human well-being Eliminating poverty, safeguarding health, solving economic and employment issues, and reducing inequalities based on race, gender, and accessibility to education are goals defined by the UN (SDGs 1, 3–5, 8, and 10) that are essential to human well-being. Implementation of these goals is dependent on pursuing common human well-being and their achievements will contribute to conservation and sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems. Socioeconomic factors such as education level, poverty and gender are responsible for the vulnerability of many developing countries to waterborne diseases (Adelodun et al., 2021 ). Water source pollution levels are generally higher in communities with low levels of education and employment and there are differences in the impacts of pollution among races (Farmer, 2017 ). Universal education (Target 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) is a way to improve human capital, promote economic growth, and lift large segments of the population out of poverty and other forms of inequality (Lutz et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, education tends to help local populations acquire clean technology production and skills, ensuring their ability to apply new technologies to address the pollution of reservoir ecosystems and upgrade essential ecosystem services. Education for all can accelerate widespread public acceptance of knowledge and reform policies needed for reservoir ecosystem conservation (Target 4.7). This includes efficient use of resources, emissions reduction, and cleaner and more sustainable production and consumption patterns (Tortajada, 2020 ). In short, there is a direct or indirect synergy between quality education and the reduction of inequalities, reservoir ecosystems conservation and implementation of SDGs that require coordination and implementation of comprehensive policies across sectors such as education and social development. Reservoir construction is booming due to human demand, but health risks from contamination of their environmental media raise concerns about the sustainability of these infrastructures. According to statistics, health risks resulting from exposure to pollution, including water, air and chemicals, account for 25% of the total global disease burden (Dora et al., 2015 ). When contaminated reservoir waters are used for drinking, food processing, aquaculture, or recreational activities, they pose a threat to public health. Furthermore, increasing number of emerging pollutants and unsafe waste disposal have cause more serious reservoir waters pollution, thus reducing global health benefits (Upfold et al., 2021 ). Ensuring health of the human population will require significant reductions in number of waterborne diseases and other illnesses and deaths caused by water pollution (Target 3.3 and 3.9). Improved technologies for treatment of excreta and wastewater as well as greater investment in water supply reservoir and public sanitation facilities are key to maintaining good public health (O'Gorman and Penner, 2018 ). Identifying and quantifying reservoir pollution risks on the basis of epidemiological and toxicological studies provides early warning information on global health risks for protection of humans and ecosystems.  4.2.3 Coordinating sustainable governance policies Although reservoir infrastructure can help manage water-related disasters (floods and droughts) (Target 9.1), mismanagement and climate change may increase its negative impact on the environment and its utility for human purposes. To close the gap between economic and social strains on the environment and to ensure clean and environmentally friendly production of water, food, and energy, it is essential to upgrade reservoir infrastructure and improve industrial technologies (Target 9.4). Enhanced international technical cooperation on infrastructure can promote sustainable industrial development and economic growth at the local level, especially in some low-income countries where the development of infrastructure such as hydropower is greatly limited due to poor technical and economic conditions (Chen et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless, some of the SDGs related to economic growth and urbanization (e.g., Target 8.1, 11.1, and 11.2) have complex trade-offs with reservoir infrastructure development and sustainable operation. For instance, urban sprawl has intensified water competition between cities and agriculture (Garrick et al., 2019 ), increased pollution in lakes and reservoirs, and undermined their self-cleaning capacity (Mourão and Pereira, 2020 ). This is largely due to the failure to consider ecological processes when implementing management decisions and simultaneously develop the economy while sustaining human livelihoods. Rather than focusing on maximizing growth, the economy should focus on increasing living standards and supporting SDGs like clean water, a stable climate, intact reservoir ecosystems and peaceful societies (Naidoo and Fisher, 2020 ). Further hydropower reservoir development can also provide affordable energy and promote climate action globally. In turn, actions to mitigate climate change help to maintain services (providing food, water and energy) that ecosystems such as reservoirs can provide for the SDGs and promote and strengthen prosperity and peace of society. There is an inextricable synergy between the goals for food (Target 2.4), water (Target 6.6), energy (Target 7.2 and 7.3), and land-sea ecosystems (Target 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 15.1, 15.2, 15.4, and 15.5) and climate action (Fuso Nerini et al., 2019 ). Key for carbon reduction to address the climate challenge are actions including: increasing global investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency (Target 7.2, 7.3, and 7.a), carbon pricing and limiting usage of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies (Target 12.c), improving waste and water management, and the adoption of new green technologies in the process of urbanization and industrialization – all of which contribute to sustainable management of hydropower reservoirs. Reservoir construction and transboundary water management are key issues causing national and international tension. Peaceful and just societies, digital technologies, and international cooperation are prerequisites for resolving social, economic, and political conflicts arising from the use of natural resources and safeguarding human well-being, such as reservoir construction, hydropower development and transboundary water management. Establishing just institutions that strengthen the rule of law, increase transparency as well as participation and accountability of stakeholders (SDG 16) can all ensure sustainable infrastructure construction, development, and management of reservoirs. Coordination of changing service needs of reservoir ecosystem management, reducing pollution discharges, making information transparent and public, and increasing public participation all require support of digital technologies (Sachs et al., 2019 ). Digital application technologies such as spatial information networks and cloud computing are used to establish a global network of reservoir monitoring and protection systems to assist managers in making more efficient, low-cost, and big data-driven information-based management decisions. The challenges of reservoir ecosystem development also require the international community to establish a global platform to promote broad participation and problem solving through a transparent and inclusive processes (SDG 17). This will not only help individual countries to have equal access to the necessary knowledge needed for sustainable reservoir ecosystem management, but will also promote interdisciplinary national cooperation and enhance social structures. Sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems cannot be driven by governments alone, but requires the active participation of the public. Media campaigns and general education can raise public awareness and understanding of reservoir ecosystem management to promote public participation and support the implementation of legislation and policies to change irrational consumption and production behavior.    5 Concluding and future perspectives Ecosystem structure and function, environmental pollution and stress effects, climate impacts and ecological feedbacks, and ecosystem services and management are hot topics in the field of reservoir ecosystem research. Over time, reservoir ecosystem research topics have evolved from local (micro) to interdisciplinary applied research (macro). The interactions between ecosystems and the external environment, especially human activities and climate change, have received increasing attention. This can be attributed to the increasing living standards of human well-being and growing conflict between supply and demand of reservoir ecosystem services. Reservoir ecosystems play an important role in securing basic needs and enhancing human well-being, thus providing essential safeguards and services for implementation of the UN SDGs, even though reservoirs are not explicitly mentioned in the SDGs. Further degradation of water quality, environmental pollution, and impairment of ecosystem services in reservoir ecosystems due to climate change and human activities will directly impact the realization of the SDGs. In view of this, there is an urgent need to integrate reservoir ecosystems into the sustainable development agenda and provide guidance on sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems in support of SDGs. Based on the reservoir ecosystem research framework, the complex linkages between the SDGs and reservoir ecosystems were analyzed in the areas of securing basic material needs, pursuing common human well-being, and coordinating sustainable governance policies. Of the 169 SDGs Targets, 71% involve synergistic interactions that help reservoir ecosystems address challenges such as environmental pollution, climate change, and ecosystem management. There are synergies and trade-offs between supply and demand for reservoir ecosystems services in 9% of the Targets and only trade-offs for 2% of the Targets. These synergies and trade-offs need to be managed through coordination of political, economic, cultural, social, and environmental measures. Coordination among these fields could provide opportunities to create sustainable reservoir ecosystems and enhance synergies with the UN SDGs and minimize adverse trade-offs. Through constructed research system (Fig. 3  ), we found that research on reservoir ecosystems tends to be compartmentalized. Thus, interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral and cross-regional collaboration are needed to optimize all potential uses of reservoir ecosystems and to advance depth of research on the interlinkages with reservoir ecosystems and SDGs. Key to addressing this challenge is the need for technical cooperation and data sharing among interdisciplinary teams to advance the depth and breadth of the field of research on reservoir ecosystems, and the SDGs and their interactions. Enhanced data accessibility and modeling techniques can further improve understanding of the four major themes of global reservoir ecosystems and expand the scope and depth of research that can be conducted. For example, development of high-resolution life-cycle assessment models can further analyze climate impacts and feedbacks of reservoir ecosystems. Currently, a large amount of data is not applied to sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems, and high-resolution modeling techniques depend on reliable multi-parameter data. To address this status quo, subsequent studies should focus on collating monitoring data from the existing literature and construct multi-parameter datasets to provide data support for reservoir ecosystem pollution, risk assessment, and management at different spatiotemporal scales. Linking a wide range of environmental drivers would improve model accuracy. This research system framework would also be applicable to other studies on sustainable management of ecosystems related to the SDGs, and provides further reference for implementation and improvement of the SDGs.
