                  UNICEF's conceptual framework outlines the basic, underlying, and immediate causes of malnutrition and provides an overview of both the direct and indirect pathways to reduce malnutrition and improve health outcomes. Sustainable development goal (SDG) 2 aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”, which has the potential to directly influence nutrition outcomes. However, many of the other SDGs have the potential to improve nutrition outcomes through more indirect pathways. Using the UNICEF conceptual framework to guide our analysis, we examined the ways in which different SDGs could influence nutrition and health outcomes, and the pathways by which this could occur. However, large data gaps exist making it difficult to accurately assess the current state of SDGs in many countries and regions. In order to increase accountability for the SDGs, the existing gaps in data collection must be addressed. This will enable countries to examine both the indirect and the direct pathways to improving nutrition outcomes globally.

Case Study 1 Causes of Malnutrition in Palestine  Case Study 1 This case study illustrates the trickle-down effects of the basic causes of malnutrition on underlying and immediate causes in Palestine. The use of UNICEF's framework on the causes of malnutrition aids in providing a comprehensive understanding of the factors affiliated with and continuously perpetuate the prevalence rates of the multiple burdens of malnutrition present in Palestine. Overall, 7.4% of Palestinian children under the age of 5 are stunted and face chronic malnutrition and 1.2% are wasted (WFP, 2016 ). At the same time, 8% of children under five are overweight (WFP, 2016 ). There is also evidence of the double burden of stunting and overweight and obesity among Palestinian children (Ghattas et al., 2017 ; Massad et al., 2012 ). High rates of micronutrient deficiencies, particularly anemia, also exist (WHO, 2012 ). Nearly half of young children 12–15 months suffer from anemia (PCBS, 2017 ). These multiple burdens of malnutrition have both immediate and long-term impacts on the health and wellbeing of children living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (Turner et al., 2016 ). Basic causes : Basic causes of malnutrition in Palestine include political instability, marginalization, and low employment, among others. Political marginalization indirectly affects the health of the people living in those communities, including fostering circumstances that lead to malnutrition in children and adults. Marginalization is a process in which individuals are blocked from enjoying the rights of full citizenship and social privileges that include the rights to basic economic and social welfare as well as participation in the society, consisting of work opportunities, education, and fulfillment of basic needs in terms of access to medical aid and food supplies (Giacaman, 2001 ). Since the beginning of the occupation in 1948, the Palestinians have faced numerous physical and mental health difficulties due to marginalization (Devi, 2004 ). The Israeli government has placed various restrictions that have impeded on the quality of life of the Palestinian people (Devi, 2004 ). Checkpoints, construction of the Israeli wall, and continued growth of Israeli settlements are only a few of the physical barriers that encourage the disfranchisement of Palestinians (Devi, 2004 ). Figurative forms of marginalization manifest themselves in manners such as restrictive movement, primarily as a result of the physical barriers, limiting employment possibilities and access to healthcare facilities and provisions, and poor living conditions (UN, 2010 ). With 25.8% of the population living below the poverty line (38.8% in Gaza, 17.8% in the West Bank) and high unemployment rates (40% in Gaza, 20% in the West Bank), obtaining basic resources is extremely difficult (Turner et al., 2016 ). All of these various restrictions have severely encroached on the nutritional statuses of the Palestinians, particularly the children. In addition to the burden of nutrition attributed to these basic causes, children are highly susceptible mental health issues associated with traumatic events, and enduring social problems brought by the conflict (Tsigga and Grammatikopoulou, 2012 ). Lack of employment and inadequate financial capacity create barriers to food access (Basak, 2012 ). These basic causes of malnutrition subsequently influence the underlying and immediate causes of malnutrition. Underlying causes : Underlying causes of malnutrition include food insecurity, both in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, inaccessibility to health services (primarily through physical barriers due to checkpoints), and water and environmental sanitation issues (UN-OCHA, 2016 ). As of January 2018, 1.6 million people total in Palestine were food insecure and in need of food assistance—39% in Gaza and 13% in the West Bank (WFP, 2018 ). Households spend more than 50% of their monthly income on food, and high food prices make it difficult for families to purchase nutritious foods (Kampschoer, 2014 ). A significant proportion of the population relies on food aid. In January 2018, the World Food Program assisted 263,570 beneficiaries with food aid (WFP, 2018 ). However, challenges in reaching all of those in need remain due to funding limitations. At the same time, food aid solely eases immediate food needs rather than providing sustainable access (WFP, 2018 ). Food production is limited as a result of natural conditions, consistent conflict causing severe damage to land resources, and Israeli land-use controls (Turner et al., 2016 ). In addition to barriers to accessing food, there are challenges in accessing safe water. Fifty-five percent of the Gaza Strip faces severe energy needs and only 5% of the piped water is potable (UN-OCHA, 2016 ). Immediate causes : The immediate causes can be seen in the interplay between inadequate dietary intake and illness. Children face acute respiratory infections as well as occurrences of diarrhea due to poor environmental health and hygiene condition (Abu Mourad et al., 2008 ). Illness and infections then affect the body's ability to absorb the nutrients consumed through the diet (Abu Mourad et al., 2008 ). The nutrient-rich diets needed to maintain proper growth are lacking in marginalized communities, thus hindering overall growth and development of children and contributing to the multiple burdens of malnutrition. The success of reducing the multiple burdens of malnutrition in Palestine is contingent upon a comprehensive understanding of the multitude of factors that perpetuate its existence and the need to address all three types of causes simultaneously. This could be achieved through addressing the SDGs. Confronting the roots of these causes challenges the systems in place that hinder the achievement of SDGs 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 16. Tackling the underlying and immediate causes directly impacts goals 2 (no hunger), 6 (clean water and sanitation), and 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Meanwhile, confronting basic causes impacts goals 1 (no poverty), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions). It is crucial that prioritization of needs of the Palestinian people be at the forefront of all nutrition-related interventions.

Sustainable development goal (SDG) 2 aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture”, which has the potential to directly influence nutrition outcomes. However, many of the other SDGs have the potential to improve nutrition outcomes through more indirect pathways. Using the UNICEF conceptual framework to guide our analysis, we examined the ways in which different SDGs could influence nutrition and health outcomes, and the pathways by which this could occur. However, large data gaps exist making it difficult to accurately assess the current state of SDGs in many countries and regions. In order to increase accountability for the SDGs, the existing gaps in data collection must be addressed. This will enable countries to examine both the indirect and the direct pathways to improving nutrition outcomes globally.   Keywords Malnutrition  Sustainable development goals  Nutrition policy    1 Introduction Reducing malnutrition is a challenge that persists for many countries around the world. Malnutrition manifests itself in various forms, with approximately 88% of countries facing multiple burdens such as childhood stunting, anemia, and overweight that significantly impact the health status and quality of life of millions of people worldwide (Development Initiatives, 2017 ). Progress has been made to address these burdens, especially in reducing undernutrition, but significant challenges remain. The prevalence of maternal and child undernutrition remains high in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Black et al., 2008 ; Development Initiatives, 2017 ). There are currently 815 million people who are hungry, 150.8 million children under five who are stunted, and approximately 50.5 million who are wasted, as well as billions of people with micronutrient deficiencies globally (UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank Group, 2018 ). Simultaneously, the prevalence of overweight/obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) continues to increase both in high-income countries as well as in LMICs with a total of 2 billion adults and 41 million children currently overweight or obese (Development Initiatives, 2017 ). 1.1 Conceptual Framework of Malnutrition UNICEF's conceptual framework on the causes of malnutrition, originally developed in 1991 and since modified to incorporate new information and evidence, recognizes the multifactorial determinants of maternal and child nutrition, as well as their consequences and impacts. The framework classifies the causes of malnutrition into three categories: basic, immediate, and underlying (Fig. 1  ). The ultimate goal of delineating these causes is to inform the comprehensive assessment and analysis of the drivers of nutrition-related problems and thus, identify ways to address them. Basic causes include systemic challenges, such as political, social, cultural, and economic issues that lead to an unequal distribution of human, institutional, and financial capital as well as other significant resources (Reinhardt and Fanzo, 2014 ). Underlying causes include household food security, care and feeding practices, access to quality health services, and a clean environment. Both the basic and underlying causes can affect the immediate causes of undernutrition, which include inadequate dietary intake and/or increased disease frequency and severity. In turn, malnutrition can have short- and long-term consequences, including increasing the risk of overweight and obesity and diet-related NCD, that span generations (Reinhardt and Fanzo, 2014 ). In order to tackle the global burden of malnutrition, the basic, underlying, and immediate causes all need to be addressed. Given the complexity of trying to understand the multitude of factors that cause malnutrition, applying a framework that guides the identification of basic, underlying, and immediate causes of malnutrition to specific country contexts can help to identify priority areas for action. For this reason, among others, the UNICEF framework continues to be widely used even 30 years since its initial development.  1.2 Global Initiatives to Address Malnutrition Over the past few decades, there has been an increased global effort to address the burden of malnutrition. The United Nations (UN), in particular, has taken up initiatives to work toward more successful achievement of development agendas, including the millennium development goals (MDGs) established in 2000 followed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. These development agendas, undertaken by the international communities, aim to work toward all aspects affiliated with overall equitable prosperity through the eradication of all forms of poverty and achievement of universal peace (ECOSOC, 2016 ). In addition to the MDGs and SDGs, which include targets related to malnutrition, the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition calls for broader improvements in nutrition globally, as described in more detail below. The MDGs provided concrete and measurable goals, targets, and time-bound indicators to fight poverty and undernutrition from 2000 to 2015. By 2015, significant progress had been made toward achieving the MDGs (UN, 2010, 2015a, b ), but it was uneven across countries and regions, and large gaps separated the poorest and richest households, as well as rural and urban areas (Armah, 2015 ; Fehling et al., 2013 ). Moreover, key indicators related to malnutrition were left off of the MDG agenda, including stunting (i.e., chronic undernutrition) and overweight/obesity. In September 2015, the SDGs superseded the MDGs. The SDGs differ from the MDGs in their breadth and scope: the SDGs aim to enhance global equity, environmental sustainability, and partnership (ECOSOC, 2016 ; Kumar et al., 2016 ). There are 17 goals and 169 associated targets for sustainable growth and equal resource distribution for all people that make up the SDGs (Kumar et al., 2016 ). SDG 2 aims to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.” Whereas the MDGs focused exclusively on LMICs, all countries are expected to work toward achieving the SDGs (Kumar et al., 2016 ). Each of these goals, and their corresponding targets, has associated indicators in order to track progress toward the successful achievement of the 2030 agenda. They span a wide range of topics including income equality, gender and sex, health, educational and environmental justice, and other economic and social issues. Although covering a plethora of development and equity issues, the indicators are not all-encompassing and important development issues were still left out of the targets. For example, adult obesity is not included in the indicators (ECOSOC, 2016 ) despite its large global burden (Ng et al., 2014 ). To further address malnutrition, the UN's Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–25) promotes the global nutrition agenda and supports the objectives set forth by the SDGs (FAO, 2016 ). The Decade is a country-driven initiative that engages all nutrition stakeholders in developing specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) commitments by 2025. This global, collective effort calls for action across six pillars of nutrition: sustainable food systems for healthy diets; health systems providing universal coverage of essential nutrition actions; social protection and nutrition education; trade and investment for improved nutrition; enabling food and breastfeeding environments; and nutrition governance and accountability (FAO, 2016 ). The focus of this chapter is on the role of the SDGs to improve nutrition outcomes through both direct and the indirect pathways. Although SDG 2 is the only goal specifically focused on addressing malnutrition, it is likely that many of the other SDGs could influence malnutrition through their effects on the underlying and basic causes of malnutrition. Thus, the aim of this chapter is to: (1) examine how the different SDGs may affect the basic, underlying, and immediate causes of maternal and child malnutrition and (2) use existing data to assess the progress countries have made on these SDGs in order to identify where greater attention is needed to tackle malnutrition.   2 Potential Influence of the SDGs For the purpose of this chapter and for further understanding how SDGs can influence nutrition, they have been aligned with the UNICEF's Framework of the basic, underlying, and immediate causes in addition to the short- and long-term consequences of undernutrition. Fig. 2   demonstrates the ways in which various SDGs influence the basic, underlying, and immediate causes of maternal and child undernutrition based on the framework. This approach has been conducted to demonstrate the multiple pathways by which the SDGs could help to address the burdens of malnutrition. Overweight/obesity and NCDs are only included in the UNICEF framework as long-term consequences; however, they will be considered as one of the forms of malnutrition in this section. Overall, three SDGs (SDGs 2, 3, and 6) have been identified as having direct effects on malnutrition by influencing the immediate and underlying causes of undernutrition. SDGs 14 and 15 also influence the underlying causes of malnutrition by affecting food security, while 11 other SDGs (SDGs 1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17) have the potential to indirectly affect malnutrition by addressing basic causes. We describe these in further detail below. Case Study 1   provides an overview of the basic, underlying, and immediate causes of malnutrition in Palestine. 2.1 Immediate and Underlying Causes SDG 2, which pertains to working toward achieving sustainable solutions aimed at improving household food security, feeding practices, and access to quality nutritious food items, has the potential to ensure adequate dietary intake and reduce the risk for undernutrition. SDG 3 may improve access to care and lead to reductions in disease prevalence and severity, and mortality rate for the current generation, consequently, leading to reductions in malnutrition risks for the next generation as well. These risks include immediate negative outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, and disability and long-term outcomes such as stunting, reduced cognitive development, neurological problems, and increased likelihoods of obesity and NCDs (Black et al., 2013 ; Martorell and Zongrone, 2012 ). SDG 6 aims to improve access to clean water and sanitation, directly improving the household environment which can reduce infections and the prevalence of maternal and child malnutrition. SDGs 14 and 15 cover both environmental justice and the feedback loop in the relationship between humans and earth in regards to production and consumption, and consequent diminishing availability and quality of food. Thus, they impact not only the underlying causes through its effects on household food security but also on basic causes as life below water and life on land both influence and are influenced by sociocultural, economic, and political contexts.  2.2 Basic Causes Increasing the various sources of capital including financial, human, physical, and social, as intended by goals 1 and 4 ultimately leads to overall improved household access to an adequate quantity and quality of resources, such as land, education, employment, income, and technology. Attaining these resources creates a chain effect that can potentially lead to decreased prevalence of undernutrition. SDGs 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17 can improve and stabilize the sociocultural, economic, environmental, and political contexts. These changes are essential to ensuring that resources are used efficiently and distributed equitably for the achievement of national development and the eradication of malnutrition. Although synergies and convergences exist among the goals, there are various instances in which there may be trade-offs in achieving one goal at the behest of another.   3 Using Indicators to Assess SDGs The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SG), established in 2015 in collaboration with the Statistical Commission, have identified a total of 229 indicators for most, but not all, of the SDGs (ECOSOC, 2016 ). Having indicators for all of the SDGs, and their targets, is critical in order to track progress as part of the 2030 agenda. The IAEG-SDG indicator global framework aims to provide a set of indicators, for both specific population groups and geographical areas, which can be used in all countries and allows for continual assessment and monitoring of the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development within each region (ECOSOC, 2016 ). Table 1   describes the specific pathways by which each of the identified SDGs may influence maternal and child malnutrition, as well as the indicators used to measure these SDGS. The tier classification in the table, as defined by the IAEG, categorizes each indicator based on its clarity, methodology, and establishment of international standards (UN, 2016 ). Indicators considered to be Tier I are those that are conceptually clear, have internationally established standards, and data pertaining to affiliated targets are regularly produced by countries (UN, 2016 ). Twenty-six of the indicators were considered Tier III, which indicates that no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for those indicators, but are being developed/tested (UN, 2016 ). The purpose of assessing the SDGs and associated targets through the indicators developed by IAEG is to identify potential pathways for improvements in malnutrition and evaluate the progress that is necessary for countries to address and meet the SDGs by 2030. A compilation of data obtained by searching surveys, reports, and several different databases provides information on the current status of indicators within the nine respective regions, as determined by the Global Nutrition Report: sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Northern Africa, South Asia, South East Asia, Eastern Asia, Western and Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, Europe and Northern America, and Oceania (Global Nutrition Report, 2017 ). Sources include but were not limited to: World Bank (WB), International Labor Organization (ILO), Global Nutrition Report, Countdown to 2015, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH), International Telegraph Union (ITU), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and UN Women. Data availability and gaps were examined for each indicator and region. Of the selected indicators, the countries in a particular region that had data available were calculated as a percentage, based on the number of total countries divided by the number of countries within the region. To avoid redundancy, indicators were grouped and targets that had similar data availability and/or were compiled from the same source were combined. Data for genital mutilation/cutting and for official development assistance were not included, as they only pertained to a limited number of countries. After compiling the data, the mean (average), minimum value, and maximum value for each of the selected indicators were examined for each respective region. Eighty-three indicators were included in the analysis with a few exceptions due to difficulty in calculating means, and minimum and maximum values for some variables given the way that the data were reported. More specifically, data were reported as < 5% for Target 2.1, < 0.1 for two indicators for Target 3.3, and in national currency for Target 2.b, and only for a limited number of countries, which made intercountry comparison difficult. Data for Targets 4.a and 4.c were only available for countries in Africa, and data for Target 5.3 were only applicable to countries in Africa and a few countries in Asia. Data for Target 6.a were generally recorded by the provider rather than by the receiver and thus limited to a few countries. Lastly, data were reported as “yes” or “no” for Target 13.1, and not as numerical values. 3.1 Gaps in Data Availability Several gaps exist within the data availability across different countries and/or across goals and targets as a result of differences in systematic collection of necessary information. Table 2   provides an overview of the data gaps for the different goals and targets associated with the basic, underlying, and immediate causes of malnutrition. The percentages indicate the proportion of countries within each of the nine regions with data available for each of the targets, thus shedding light on the extent of the existing gaps in data availability globally, and the differences among regions. While countries in Africa and South Asia, have more data available, locations in regions of Oceania, Europe, and North America do not have as much information available or are updated less frequently. Indicators covered under the MDGs, such as data for components of SDG 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, were more likely to have data available, while some of the newly developed indicators for the SDGs lacked systematic data collection methods, including an internationally agreed upon standard or reporting methodology. Data were lacking for SDGs 11, 12, 13, and 17 and their given subtargets. These SDGs relate to a country's infrastructure and environment (i.e., basic causes of malnutrition), which are generally difficult to quantify and measure. There were also no data available for SDGs 14 and 15 which pertain to life in the water and on the land, respectively. Moreover, for many countries there was also a limited range of data that had been disaggregated by age, gender, region (urban or rural), and able-bodied status.   4 The Current State of SDG Indicators Across Countries and Regions 4.1 Maternal and Child Malnutrition: Short- and Long-Term Consequences The prevalence of short- and long-term consequences of malnutrition can be observed with different levels of variability. For the short-term consequences of maternal and child malnutrition (e.g., mortality), variability is quite high among and within regions. However, the long-term consequences of undernutrition, namely mortality attributed to NCDs among adults aged 30–70, is less variable, ranging from 16.4% in Latin America and the Caribbean to 21.2% in Western and Central Asia. Malnutrition in children under five was variable depending on region and type of malnutrition. Table 3   depicts the average prevalence of stunting, wasting, and overweight in children under five for each region. The range in the mean prevalence of stunting was wide (7.4%–31.6%), with the highest prevalence in SSA and the lowest in Europe and North America. In SSA, the country with the highest prevalence of stunting was Burundi and the lowest was Seycehelle. In Europe and North America, the highest prevalence of stunting was Albania and the lowest was Germany. While a total of 46 countries were examined in the sub-Saharan African region, information on only nine countries was obtained for Europe and North America, which has implication for the interpretation of the data included in the table. The range in the prevalence of wasting was even wider (5.2%–40%), with South Asia having the highest prevalence and Europe and North America the least. Similarly, data in 45 countries in the sub-Saharan African region were collected, in which South Sudan had the highest prevalence of wasting and Swaziland the lowest, while only nine countries were examined in Europe and North America, with Albania having the highest prevalence and the United States, the lowest. These vast differences across regions may be a result of a vast plethora of factors including but not limited to issues pertaining to development including lack of resources for populations or simply a lack of appropriate data collection mechanisms to obtain accurate information. Regions with higher levels of development, and countries classified as high income, have the lowest prevalence of the indicators of undernutrition. On the other hand, the range in the prevalence of overweight among children under five (3.8%–13.1%) is much smaller across different regions, regardless of the stage of development. The highest prevalence of overweight in children under five is in Europe, North America, and North Africa: Libya has the highest prevalence (22.4%) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has the lowest (~ 0%). In all regions but South Asia, at least one country has a prevalence of overweight in children under five that exceeds 10%. Thus, child overweight affects nearly all countries and regions worldwide. Maternal malnutrition is not measured as it does not have an affiliated target included within the SDGs. It is crucial, however, that the nutritional status of mothers be taken into account as it is highly indicative of the nutritional statuses of not only their children but also their entire households as well as future offspring (UNICEF, 2009 ).  4.2 Indicators of Underlying Causes of Child and Maternal Malnutrition For indicators related to the underlying causes of malnutrition, there is a wider variability in the prevalence between more economically stable regions, such as East Asia, and Europe and North America, and less affluent ones, especially SSA (Table 4  ). Indicators relating to healthcare services, safe drinking water, and food insecurity showed that conditions are better for populations in Europe and North America, and East Asia (and Oceania for food insecurity) than in SSA, where food insecurity is the highest. Although the overall trends revealed that underlying causes of malnutrition are more prevalent in less developed regions, the analysis also highlighted important nuances. In regions where food insecurity is highly prevalent, the range of its prevalence is large, indicating a significant discrepancy in food security within the same region. Among healthcare indicators, there is less variability among regions for family planning. Even regions that include mainly high-income countries only satisfied the family planning needs of approximately half of women. The proportion of the population using safe drinking water is high among most regions: although SSA has the lowest average, it is still relatively high at 73%. It is also notable that within every region there are countries reaching 98%–100% of the population using safe drinking water.  4.3 Indicators of Basic Causes of Maternal and Child Undernutrition The examination of SDG indicators for targets that affect malnutrition through basic causes show that conditions are better in more affluent regions, as is the case with underlying causes of malnutrition. Table 4  demonstrates the averages for the indicators of the SDGs that address basic causes of malnutrition for each region, as well as corresponding countries with the highest and lowest values for those indicators. SSA has the highest proportion of the population below the international poverty line with Democratic Republic of Congo having the greatest proportion and Mauritius having the least. Information on poverty levels in the regions of Northern Africa, Eastern Asia, and Oceania were either missing and/or limited. Data were also missing for the regions of Eastern Asia and Oceania for the indicators relating to the proportion of male and female children age 5–14 years engaged in child labor and female child labor. Less developed regions have a larger proportion of people living below the international poverty line, lower literacy and employment rates, and less government expenditure on social protection. These regions also experience a higher prevalence of child labor and violence against women, influential elements that impact individual and community levels of nutrition due to the interactions that exist between gender and health (FAO, 2012 ). Gender-based violence, particularly aimed at women, impacts nutrition by diminishing physical access to resources, harming women and girls in their productive and reproductive years leading to poor pregnancy outcomes and increased levels of child mortality and morbidity, all of which hinders their capacities to be household earners and caregivers, thus consequently reinforcing the cycles of poverty. For indicators related to government expenditures, violence against women, and informal housing, wealthier regions do not uniformly outperform less affluent ones. Though government expenditure on social protection is the lowest in the world's poorest regions, the reverse is true for education spending: education expenditures are the highest in South East Asia (18.7%) and the lowest in Europe and North America (10.3%). The prevalence of violence against women varies regionally depending on the perpetrator: violence perpetrated by a current or former partner against women and girls 15 years and older is high in SSA (27.3%) and South Asia (23.8%), but violence perpetrated by someone other than one's partner is the highest in Europe and North America (5.7%) and Oceania (18%). The proportion of households living in informal settlements is high in several regions, such as SSA (59.3%) and South Sudan (96%), but it is notable that in all regions with data, there are some countries with very high levels of informal settlements (South Sudan—96%, Sudan—92%, Afghanistan—63%, Cambodia—55%, Mongolia—43%, Yemen—61%, and Haiti—74%).   5 Concluding Remarks The SDGs usher in a new era by virtue of their comprehensive, multisectoral focus, which is essential for the widespread improvement of nutrition. They call for the collection of data on a wide range of indicators in all countries around the world, two features which distinguish the SDGs from the MDGs. The breadth of the SDGs also may help direct policy attention to problems that hinder sustainable development in LMICs and promote greater awareness of issues shared by different countries and regions, regardless of their geography or wealth. Shared knowledge on best practices for addressing the dietary risk factors of NCDs, a growing problem around the world, could be one such positive outcome. The comprehensiveness of the SDGs has the potential to engender more sustainability for the goals that are achieved. Progress made in one SDG area has the potential to buttress other SDGs, a cobenefit that is especially relevant for the basic and underlying causes of malnutrition. However, in order to ensure this sustainability, increased data collection and greater accountability are needed. The progress achieved by the SDGs will likely have lasting effects that improve the development outcomes of future generations. Investments in education and social protection, two sectors that have close linkages with nutrition outcomes, can promote intergenerational changes in nutritional status and overall health (FAO, 2015 ). The causes of malnutrition must also be addressed using multifaceted and sustainable approaches within each country. For many countries, it is likely that the most basic causes of malnutrition will have to be addressed before the burden of malnutrition can be substantially reduced. This is particularly true for countries that have ongoing conflict. Mitigating the political, economic, and social causes of malnutrition will increase the likelihood of sustained good nutrition and improve the resilience of communities to shocks. In every region of the world, there is at least one country with over 40% of the population living in informal housing. Lack of stable housing coincides with limited access to clean water and sanitation, which can greatly affect nutrition. In countries with very high proportions of the population living in informal housing, addressing this basic cause of malnutrition could lead to significant improvements in the burden of malnutrition. As seen in Palestine, in order to encourage sustainable solutions, solely providing food through aid without conflict resolution is ineffective. Interventions and policies must be contextualized, prioritize the needs of the population, and ensure that basic, underlying, and immediate causes of malnutrition are addressed in order to ensure sustainability. Nutrition can improve around the world as countries make progress on their respective goals, even goals that are not nutrition specific. Making headway on goals that influence the basic or underlying causes of malnutrition can have tremendous positive effects on malnutrition overall. Education, family planning, violence against women, and housing stability are all sectors that can have significant effects on nutrition, in every and all regions around the world, regardless of development status. It is important to make note that global inequities that exist in all regions, hinder the ability to foster resilient systems including those related to food and nutrition. Even in the United States, one of the world's “richest, most powerful and technologically innovative countries…40 million people continue to live in poverty” (OHCHR, 2017 ). When there is political and social will to counter the causes of poverty that fall in line with basic causes of malnutrition, there is strong chance for elimination of poor nutrition (OHCHR, 2017 ). One of the ways to break the poverty cycle is by education (FAO, 2015 ). It is encouraging that government expenditure on education is high in some of the poorest regions of the world, where the least progress has been achieved on the SDGs. The comprehensive, multisectoral focus of the SDGs has the potential to transcend the pitfalls of the MDGs, but concerns over data must be resolved in order to allow for better measurement of progress and increase accountability. There are large gaps in the data available to measure the SDGs, which must be addressed through a significant investment in data collection. This lack of data makes it far more difficult for countries to develop and meet their commitments, let alone to adhere to the UN's SMART guidelines or track progress over time. It reduces accountability of all stakeholders involved including the government as well as civil society and nongovernmental organizations. Disaggregated data are especially important for identifying inequities in progress and attaining the goals for different subsets of the population. Making progress in attaining the SDGs will lead to substantial advancements in addressing the burden of malnutrition through both direct and indirect pathways. In order to achieve reductions in malnutrition, investment across multiple sectors will be needed. In many countries, it is likely that addressing the most basic causes of malnutrition will be necessary before reducing the burden of malnutrition will be possible. Every country will have a different path toward addressing the SDGs, and these approaches should be based on country context and prioritized based on the needs of the population. However, in order to ensure that measuring progress is possible, existing data gaps will need to be addressed and investment in surveillance systems required. With measurement comes accountability, and with accountability for commitments comes the real potential for reducing the burden of malnutrition.    References Abu Mourad et al., 2008 T.
