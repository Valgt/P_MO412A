                  Increasing global population and urbanization, coupled with rising standards of living have contributed to two of the world’s most important challenges: a) increasing per capita energy consumption and global reliance on fossil fuels, and b) increasing per capita waste generation. The UN prominently featured addressing these two issues in goal numbers seven and eleven, respectively, of the SDGs. Waste-to-Energy (WTE) technologies have the potential to serve as a connecting link to support the successful pursuit of these two goals. They can control urban wastes and elevate waste as a necessary resource for energy production. This study reviews and presents an appraisal of the fast-evolving WTE technologies and their potential to harness energy potential of wastes in the pursuit of SDGs number seven and eleven. The study reveals illuminates the apparent inherent potential of WTE technologies to support the SDGs due to the considerable flexibility they present with their ability to utilize different forms of waste as feedstock. Environmental and economic performance of WTE incineration have steadily improved over the years, making it pivotal in pursuing these goals. Meanwhile, technologies such as gasification, anaerobic digestion, and pyrolysis have vastly expanded the array of waste products that are diverted from landfills for energy generation purposes. While there is lot more room for WTE technologies to grow into the mainstream in terms of their energy production capabilities, it is without doubt that investing and elevating WTE technologies will support the global drive towards achieving SDG numbers seven and eleven.

Increasing global population and urbanization, coupled with rising standards of living have contributed to two of the world’s most important challenges: a) increasing per capita energy consumption and global reliance on fossil fuels, and b) increasing per capita waste generation. The UN prominently featured addressing these two issues in goal numbers seven and eleven, respectively, of the SDGs. Waste-to-Energy (WTE) technologies have the potential to serve as a connecting link to support the successful pursuit of these two goals. They can control urban wastes and elevate waste as a necessary resource for energy production. This study reviews and presents an appraisal of the fast-evolving WTE technologies and their potential to harness energy potential of wastes in the pursuit of SDGs number seven and eleven. The study reveals illuminates the apparent inherent potential of WTE technologies to support the SDGs due to the considerable flexibility they present with their ability to utilize different forms of waste as feedstock. Environmental and economic performance of WTE incineration have steadily improved over the years, making it pivotal in pursuing these goals. Meanwhile, technologies such as gasification, anaerobic digestion, and pyrolysis have vastly expanded the array of waste products that are diverted from landfills for energy generation purposes. While there is lot more room for WTE technologies to grow into the mainstream in terms of their energy production capabilities, it is without doubt that investing and elevating WTE technologies will support the global drive towards achieving SDG numbers seven and eleven.

Human populations are consuming significant amounts of energy through the production and consumption of resources as there is a general trend of increased per capita energy consumption due to rising standards of living [1] . The rapid rise in energy consumption is introducing high levels of GHG emissions into the atmosphere, which is known to be fundamental to climate change. Traditionally, the world has relied primarily on fossil fuels for energy supply [2–4] . While renewable energy has been advocated in recent years to mitigate climate change, fossil fuel contribution to total global energy supply has not reduced. Currently, as seen in Figure 1  , traditional fossil fuels ranging from coal, crude oil, and natural gas account for about 13,700 TWh – about 84% – of electricity production in the world [2,5] . The high contribution of fossil fuels to primary energy supply remains an avenue of consternation for environmentalists and policy-makers alike, especially, given the continued dwindling of global fossil fuel reserves and fluctuating oil prices combined with climate change impacts [2,6] . The urgency of the need to continually pursue alternatives that will rapidly wean the globe off fossil fuels is evident in predictions such as that of the U.S. Department of Energy that states that the earth is likely to warm by 1.7–4.9 °C over the period 1990–2100, due to carbon emissions [3,7] . The United Nations (UN) currently projects the world’s population to top 9 billion people by 2050, with more than 50 percent inhabiting urban areas [8] . High energy consumption and waste generation are natural consequences of such rates of high population and urbanization. In fact, according to FAO [9] , global energy demand will increase by nearly 60% by the year 2025. As far as waste generation is concerned, studies have estimated that municipal soil waste (MSW) generation levels will likely increase to about 2.6 billion tons by the year 2025 from its current level of 2.4, as urbanization and income levels increase [5,10,11] . Owing to this, the world is in dire need of sustainable urban development that will respond to high energy demand and waste levels [5] . The world acknowledges that continuing development and adoption of clean and sustainable energy are critical towards the drive for sustainable development, and has vigorously pursued alternative energy sources such as renewable bioenergy, solar radiation, wind, and waves among others [7,12,13] . While the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) did not explicitly outline any targets in terms of global waste management and renewable energy development, these two issues featured prominently in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015, highlighting the recognition of their importance in achieving sustainable development. Specifically, the goal number 7 of the SDGs set the following targets in pursuit of sustainable and renewable energy: a) ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services; b) to substantially increase the share of renewable energy to global energy mix by 2030; c) to double the rate of improvement of energy efficiency in countries around the globe by 2030; d) to facilitate access to renewable and clean energy technology and promote investment in energy infrastructure by 2030; and e) to increase supply of modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries through infrastructure expansion and technology upgrade by 2030 [14] . In a similar breadth, the sixth target in the goal number 11, which is to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, states the following: by 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management [14] . Tapping into waste materials to produce energy seems to be one of the most attractive options for future energy supply. This is because it holds the potential to aid in dealing with two crucial global challenges, which are namely: dealing with increased waste levels due to rising world population and urbanization; and mitigating fossil fuel driven GHG emissions [6,7] . Waste-to-Energy (WTE) technologies have shown enough promise in both of these directions. The concept of WTE is not necessarily new as in renewable bioenergy development, using wastes from agricultural activities have been critical for the development of second generation biofuels. In recent years, however, WTE technologies have been increasingly developed to extract energy from an even wider array of wastes including MSW and sludge [6,7,15–17] . The appeal of WTE technologies has spurred many countries and world communities towards the quick adoption of these fast-evolving technologies [18] . Currently, the US and other developing countries around the world handle MSW in a hierarchy of preferred methodologies, where WTE far out-ranks landfilling. Agricultural wastes, industrial and domestic wastes have been identified as endowed with renewable materials that are capable of producing energy in forms like biohydrogen, biogas, and bioalcohols [7,19–22] . Utilization of the growing levels of MSW and waste sludge for renewable energy finds the all-important string that connects providing a sustainable source of energy and transforming waste into a well-needed resource in the form of raw materials for energy generation [2,6] . In fact, many studies have been conducted by different authors regarding the potential of WTE technologies in country case studies [5,10,13,23,24]  and advancements on the global level to support energy production [6,25–27] . However, there is currently no study assesses the potential of WTE technologies to support the SDGs. It is based on this observation that the authors of this study argue that if waste resources can be developed to be of such important value through WTE technologies, SDGs will be right on course to be able to achieve two of the most notable additions as the globe transitioned from the MDGs to the SDGs era, while also contributing to the success of other goals. For this reason, in this paper, the authors present a critical appraisal of the quick-evolving WTE technologies and their breakthroughs and prevailing challenges; their trends and potential of adoptability in the quest to support the pursuit of the dual goals of SDG numbers 7 and 11; and how they will generally affect prospects of the renewable energy drive in the future. This article also outlines recommendations and research priorities for large scale adoption of WTE technologies around the globe to support the aforementioned SDGs. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: an overview of the quantities of wastes produced in the world, traditional waste disposal and management regimes, and waste as a renewable energy resource; a critical analysis of different WTE technologies; the benefits of large scale deployment of WTE; a summary of the paper; and areas of research and policy priorities.  Global waste as a renewable energy resource Types of waste for energy generation In the European Commission Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC), waste is defined as “any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard” [2,28] . The umbrella of wastes is a broad one and covers a variety of items that includes those that are meant for further use, recycling or reclamation [3] . Wastes can be in the form of sludge or MSW. MSW are wastes produced at household, commercial and industrial levels, under waste regulations [2,3] . Typically, waste management decisions as far as MSW are concerned are characterized by two components: a) how much waste to produce, and b) how to dispose of the waste [2] . While these two components are distinct, they are also significantly related, as the amount of waste produced may dictate the appropriate disposal method. MSW disposal can be undertaken by several means, including landfilling [29,30] , recycling [31,32] , and thermal and biological treatments [29,33,34] . MSW treatment can be quite different from the treatment of sludge [35] .  Global waste quantities and regional variability Currently, the amount of MSW generated around the world exceeds 1.3 billion tons per year, and averages about 1.2 kg person per day (1.2 kg/capita/day). This estimate is projected to increase to about 2.2 billion tons per year by 2025, with the average waste generated by increasing to nearly 1.5 kg/person/day [11] . The global averages, however, mask the inter-and-intra regional and country variabilities that prevail. Africa and South Asia produce the least amount of waste around the world, while the OECD countries, together, produce nearly half of the wastes generated as seen in Table 1  . In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, about 62 million tons of waste is produced annually, with an average of 0.65 kg/capita/day, and a wide intra-regional variation of 0.09–3.0 kg/capita/day [11,36] . The amount of waste generated from industrial nations, both on the household level and by industry, far outweigh that of their non-industrialized counterparts. In recent decades, the amount of wastes produced in industrial regions has seen a significant increase. For instance, in a period of about 25 years, OECD countries increased their MSW per capita from about 415 kg in 1980 to 560 kg in 2006 [27,37] . The EU alone produced a total of 250 million tons of waste in 2005, with per capita topping over 520 kg in 2007 as shown in Figure 2   below [26,38] . Similar to trends registered in the EU, the US has substantially its waste produced per capita, by raising it from 444 kg in 1960 to 725 kg by 2012 [27,39] . It was estimated that MSW generated in the US increased by more than 15 million tons in a two year period: an annual growth rate of 2.5%, from 335.80 million tons in 2002 to 351.90 million tons in 2004 [24,40,41] . Increased waste generation around the world is a socioeconomic and ecological problem, and an issue of public health concern, especially in developing countries [25] . It has therefore been the preoccupation of scientists and policy makers alike to find more sustainable means of disposal. Over the last decade, however, there has been a significant drive towards developing technology that utilize waste as a needed resource in energy production.  Waste as raw material for energy generation Traditionally, resources that are considered inexhaustible or replenished by nature are those that are classified under renewable energy sources. These sources energy normally include hydro [42] , solar [43–45] , geothermal [46] , wind [43] , and biomass, among others [10,47] . According to the US DOE [48] , the term biomass encapsulates wide range of organic matter, plant and animal derived, that are available on renewable basis. This includes energy crops, agricultural wastes and residues, forest and wood wastes and residues, animal wastes, and others. MSW is currently classified under the broad umbrella of biomass it normally contains significant proportions of materials such as food waste, wood and yard trimmings, paper, and others. The US EPA also classifies MSW as a renewable resource because it is a constantly produced biogenic material that would be destined for landfills, if not channeled towards energy generation purposes [7,10,24,49] . Sludge has critical characteristics, including high energy and nutrient content. These two critical components of sludge make it technically and economically feasible to recycle nutrients and carbon from it [6,50] . The energy recovery potential of sludge is directly dependent on its composition. Sludge is mainly a mixture of volatile organic matter, inert inorganic matter, and water. The volatile solid component is the storehouse of the energy content inherent in sludge [6,51] . When dewatered, sludge can be incinerated for energy generation [27] .   Waste treatment hierarchies Historically, MSW has been primarily disposed of in landfills or dumpsites in many countries around the globe. This means of disposal has, however, oftentimes raised environmental and public health concerns [5] . Similarly, landfilling has also been a popular means through which waste sludge is disposed [6] . Other means of dealing with MSW are composting [52] , recycling [31] , and mechanical-biological treatment [24] , while incineration, ocean disposal, and application as soil conditioner are also other common methods of sludge disposal [6] . Due to the concerns related to traditional disposal methods, many countries especially the developed ones are pursuing the objective of managing and controlling waste through a hierarchical system of preference. In this hierarchy, priority is assigned to ultimately reducing waste stream [2,53] . As seen in Figure 3  , the hierarchy consists of five main steps in order of preference, namely: 1) waste prevention; 2) reuse; 3) recycling; 4) recovery (including energy recovery); and 5) safe disposal [2,53] . This hierarchy provides a useful framework for enactment policies related to waste management. After waste prevention and reuse that are meant to reduce the waste stream is recycling in the hierarchy of preference. After recycling is the energy recovery. Overall lifecycle assessments carried out by several researchers have shown that recycling is the most environmentally friendly waste management option in terms of the carbon savings and costs [2] . However, recycling does not provide the benefit of energy recovery, and materials that cannot be recycled are usually candidates for the process of energy recovery, preferable to traditional landfilling. The potential of WTE to recover energy from unrecyclable components of the waste stream has made it an indispensable part of the concept of circular economy that has been on the rise for over a decade. The concept of circular economy is a concept developed to achieve a closed-loop economy in which industrial and economic growth are decoupled from environmental degradation [54,55] . The increasing recognition of the need for renewable energy to play a central role in a circular economy has increased the core principles from the 3R (reduction, reuse, and recycling) [54]  to 5R (reduction, reuse, recycling, recovery, and reclamation) [55] . Pan et al. [55]  observed that the inclusion of WTE in the quest of closing the loop in a circular economy has enhanced industrial symbiosis in ecological industrial parks where businesses coordinate their operations to reduce waste to improve environmental quality and increase economic gains. At this juncture, it is important to present an overview of the process of recycling (as it could also be an important component to WTE as it will be explained later in a subsequent section) before focusing on a critical appraisal of various WTE technologies.  Overview of recycling Recycling products is a green and environmentally friendly approach to minimize waste and produce final materials that serve as biomass from waste for renewable energy. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, recycling is the development of collecting and processing previously manufactured materials that would be otherwise disposed in a landfill and turning them into new products [56] . Recycling is typically understood to be a continuous cycle of three steps, which is classically defined by the three arrowed recycling symbol as seen below in Figure 4  . The first step of the recycling procedure requires the recovery of previously manufactured and used resources, which would otherwise be disposed of. Methods of resource recovery include curbside collection, buy-back centers, drop-off centers and deposit/refund programs [56] . The next step of the loop entails recyclable items to be sent to a “recovery facility” where they are sorted, cleaned and processed into raw materials that can be used in the manufacturing new, marketable products [56] . This step of the process varies depending on the type of product being recycled (glass, aluminum, paper, e-waste, etc.). However, all recovered products go through a method that breaks down the original material, either through a melting or liquefying process, before it can be made into a new material. Recycled materials can be used to manufacture an assortment of products and are constantly being tested in new ways, such as using recycled glass to pave roadways [56] . The final step of the recycling sequence relies on the consumer or businesses to continuously purchase products made from recycled materials. These products include aluminum cans, carpeting, motor oil, newspapers, trash bags, nails and much more [56] . After these products have outlived their intended lifespan, the expectation is for the materials to once again be recovered by recycling facilities in order to begin this process over again. The idea behind recycling has always been a practical concept due to the economic benefits of using recycled or recovered materials versus new, “virgin” materials [57] . With an ever increasing demand for consumable materials, societies have had to explore options, which offer extra sources of materials [57,58] . The importance recycling from MSW as a precursor in the WTE process, and a critical factor in the loop of a circular economy is demonstrated in Figure 5   below.  Evolution of WTE technologies from the rudimentary to the revolutionary — assessing their pros and cons With the dwindling reserves of global oil and dangers posed by climate change, the fact that global demand for energy is expected to increase six fold by 2100 needs immense innovation and approaches that attempt to revolutionize the global energy sector [7] . WTE technologies are viewed as potential alternatives to the traditional fossil fuel production. As represented in Figure 6   below, there are three main routes through which energy is recovered from wastes, namely; 1) biochemical, 2) thermochemical, and 3) Physicochemical. In the biochemical pathway, organic wastes are converted to liquid or gaseous forms of energy primarily through biomethanation and fermentation [59,60] . For the thermochemical pathway, through processes such as incineration, gasification and pyrolysis, waste feedstocks are converted to energy in the form of electricity and heat, by applying high temperatures [61,62] . In the physicochemical pathway such as transesterification, organic wastes are converted to energy by the use of chemical agents [38,63] . At this juncture, the different technologies are appraised for their performance and influence on global energy systems. Waste incineration/combustion Waste incineration is simply the oxidation of combustible components of waste, which is employed as the most integral part of waste management around the globe [5,26,64] . Traditionally, the appeal of incineration as a waste management technique lied in the fact that it could vastly reduce the weight and volume of wastes by approximately 80% and 70%, respectively, and contribute to public health by destroying harmful substances [5,10,26] . In recent years, however, the appeal of incineration is its combination with energy recovery. Incineration is the most conventional WTE in heat and electricity generation [26] . Typically, organic materials that are recovered from wastes have sizeable deposits of energy of which about 65–80% can be tapped for heat and deployed in thermal supplies [65,66] . Of all WTE technologies, the method of incineration is the most mature and widely adopted around the globe, with the major differentiating characteristics being the different levels of advancement between countries [2,5,10,26,67,68] . The efficiency level of the process of incineration is said to be about 25–30% and can largely be determined by the composition of waste stream, especially for MSW as waste can be very heterogeneous [2,5,26] . Increasingly, advancements in incineration technologies are increasing the potential for thermal treatment and the efficacy of high energy retrieval from sewage sludge [6,26,69,70] . Generally, incineration WTEs are categorized into two. They are the mass-burn and refuse derived fuel (RDF). The main difference between the two is that mass-burn undergo little to no pre-processing of waste before incineration, while RDF undergoes pre-processing by carefully sorting materials with low heat value and low calorie content, such as glass and metals. For RDF, uniform waste content is produced after the pre-processing to be shredded to produce fuel with relatively more uniform characteristics compared to mass-burn. While RDF may be more efficient, mass-burn facilities are more common [18] . In the incineration WTE process, while there several different deployed for the combustion, there are three main incinerator types used in the combustion phase of the process, namely; a) grate incinerators or moving grates, b) rotary kilns, and c) fluidized bed. In grate incinerators, the grate, in a tumbling manner, moves the waste in the combustion chamber through different zones. Through this tumbling motion, wastes are well-mixed and uncombusted materials are readily exposed to the heat [18,26] . Rotary kilns are similar to moving grates in process except that the incineration occurs in a rotating chamber. In the rotary kiln, a cylindrical vessel spinning around its axis, by means rollers that are located under it, conveys waste by means of gravity [18,26] . In the fluidized bed incineration, there is a bed of inert material that is fluidized with at the lower section of the combustion chamber into which waste is constantly fed. Air flowing constantly beneath bed allows the waste to keep moving, in order to ensure a more complete combustion. It is normally used for processing sludge or waste that has gone through a great deal of pre-processing and therefore, finely divided like RDF [18,26,71] . While incineration has traditionally been viewed as a costly method for waste processing, the advent of WTE that makes it possible to collect heat generated from steam for heating and power generation. Funds generated from selling by-product electricity and steam improves the cost performance of incineration. It is also worth noting that efficient WTE incineration plants possess higher positive externalities through improvement in energy security and reduction of GHG emissions [2,10] . This notwithstanding, when WTE incineration is considered for its electricity generation potential only, it is found to be less efficient compared to fossil fuel-based conventional electricity plants. In fact, electrical power production efficiency in WTE incineration can be lower than 20% [2,27,72] . This, as Stehlik [27]  and Pavlas et al. [38]  explain, could be attributed to improvement in equipment requirements for waste incineration and cogeneration of heat and electricity. Combined heat and power (CHP) can raise efficiency of WTE incineration to about 80% [2] . A study conducted by Cucchiella et al. [23]  also showed that only electric configuration of a WTE plant produced emissions greater than cogenerative configuration by 14% i.e. environmental savings of 430 kg CO2eq per ton of waste and 370 kg CO2eq per ton of waste, respectively. Some researchers have conducted studies that have revealed that the environmental and economic performance of WTE incineration as against conventional power and heating plants is improving with time as the technology is improved. In a study conducted by Pavlas et al. [38] , the primary energy savings (PES) performance of stand-alone WTE systems defeated natural gas-based cogeneration systems in PES, revealing the potential to successfully substitute fossil fuels, with better environmental gains [38] . While WTE incineration’s environmental and economic performance has vastly improved over time, several challenges persist. To overcome these challenges, it is important to fully understand their nature and the inherent trade-offs that exist in the development of incineration technologies. Additionally, it is pertinent to illuminate some of the steps that have been and/or are being developed to mitigate the shortcomings. The subsequent subsections are dedicated to assessing the challenges and followed by the mitigating steps. Understanding the challenges of incineration Emissions of GHGs and air pollutants One of the biggest challenges with incineration is the emissions of GHGs and other pollutants that is contrary to the environmental benefits being some of the primary reasons for which it is pursued. While WTE incineration have been found to perform better in CO and particulate matter emissions than other technologies, it has been found to perform worse in SOX,  carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions, which can have significant negative effect on climate [5,10,73,38] . During the incineration process, the composition of the materials may result in the formation of particulate and acid gas pollutants, including SO2 , VOCs, PCBs, CO, HCl, HF, HBr, and heavy metal compounds among others [18,26,68] . Concerns about dioxin emissions have prompted more stringent regulations in many countries, developed and developing, such as Germany, China and Taiwan, among others to limit dioxin emissions to 1 ng toxic equivalent per cubic meter for incinerators [10,18,68,74,75] .  Fly ash public health concerns from WTE emissions While one of the central arguments of WTE incineration has been the potential to positively contribute to public health by killing pathogens and other bacteria that may accumulate in garbage in landfills, there are externalities relating to pollution from incineration that may be detrimental to public health [18,38] . However, fly ash from incineration poses an existential health risks, including respiratory ones, through carriage of toxic heavy metals such as mercury and lead, along with other pollutants such as furans and dioxins. Besides, incineration plants can be unsightly and could also produce unpleasant odors [2,10,55,76] . Incineration facilities can cause significant water and soil pollution through leaching, as in the case of landfilling [24,68] .  High operational cost The cost of operating a WTE incineration plant can be steep especially if operated without the possibility of CHP which can improve its efficiency and increase financial gains [10] . Even with CHP, the initial capital investments involved in WTE incineration can be deterring for poor countries [10,26] . Incineration equipment with greater capacities are normally imported by low-technology countries, which are accompanied by high operating and maintenance costs for complex pollution control mechanisms for modern facilities [10] . Meanwhile, other studies have revealed that running the most environmentally efficient WTE systems may not always be the most financially prudent, leaving proponents with a dilemma. As previously noted, Cucchiella et al. [23]  found that cogenerative configurations in WTE systems perform better environmentally; however, they found that it has worse financial performance compared to the electric only configuration. In the study, profit generated by 150 kt plant in electrical configuration was significantly higher than a 300 kt plant with cogenerative configuration (25.4 € vs. 4 € per kiloton of treated waste).   Overcoming incinerator challenges with increased regulations and technological advancements to support SDGs One of the concerns that has surrounded incineration, as previously explained, has been the enormous air pollution they can cause [18,27] . Over the years, the US and the EU have passed stringent air quality legislations such as maximum available control technology (MACT) regulations and the waste incineration directive (WID), respectively, which have contributed better environmental performing WTE incineration plants [3,18,24] . To meet the new emission standards, new age incineration plants are equipped with modern combustion, additional pollution control technologies and flue gas cleaning systems, which result in retrieving substantial amounts of energy from combustion and reduction of emissions [18,24,27] . The implementation of the MACT regulations in the US resulted significant reduction of mercury emissions, and other volatile heavy metals, furans, and dioxins by over 99% [24,77] . Performance of new generation WTE incinerators have improved so much that the USEPA considers it as one of the cleanest sources of energy in the US, and this has helped shift public perception about WTE incineration favourably [10,18,24,27,78–81] . While they may come with additional costs, advancements such as introduction of secondary combustion chambers, low-NOX  burners, dioxin filters, heat exchangers, waste heat recovery systems, wet scrubbers, and flue gas recirculation systems help ensure that emissions are reduced, and contribute to the improved environmental performance [26,27,82] . Additionally, leaching of heavy metals resulting post-combustion is also being counteracted with advanced technologies that reprocesses and recycles plant ash, rather than disposing of under traditional landfill conditions. Many countries have advanced technologies that utilize this ash by-product as cement substitute, road aggregate, and fill material [18] . Without a doubt, these advancements chalked in WTE incineration especially those designed for CHP, and further developments are increasing its viability to supporting the renewable energy drive and sustainable cities target by 2030. Besides incineration, however, a range WTE technologies have been developed since the 1970s that have the potential to complement or serve as useful alternatives to incineration. Some of these approaches are also thermochemical but arguably more advanced and not adopted on the same scale as incineration [26,53,83] . Technologies such as thermal gasification, pyrolysis, and biogas development can be applied to different forms of waste streams to achieve specific and different range of desired products. Additionally, they are able to increase efficiency that may not be achieved with incineration, due to their greater flexibility in the energy system compared with incineration that is characterized by high and constant heat production [26,53] . Sections that follow sheds light on some of these technologies and their advancements.   Gasification Gasification is simply a process whereby organic substances are partially oxidized at elevated temperatures, typically in the range of 500–1800 °C and reduced amount of oxygen. Besides, very high pressure is required for the process of gasification, in the range of 0.6–2.6 MPa (MPa). The substances are broken down in ash that forms a molten slag, which is subsequently quenched at the bottom of the gasifier, and incombustible gases [6,26,84] . As Tyagi and Lo [6]  and Bosmans et al. [26]  have indicated, the main products of gasification are heat and a high quality synthetic gas (syngas) that is formed after resultant raw gas is cleaned by removing CN, NH3  and H2 S. Being an indirect process of combustion, in gasification, an exothermic reaction takes place in a reactor as a result of a reaction between carbon and O2  that produces energy to drive the reaction [5,6] . In regard of the above, it is safe to say that the process of gasification has three main driving parameters, which are temperature, O2  concentrations, and pressure [5] . In the process of gasification, the waste to be treated is converted into a secondary energy carrier in the form of either a combustible liquid, gas or solid. Subsequently, the secondary carrier is combusted in a turbine to produce heat or electricity or both [26] . The first part of the process is carried out in an oxy-steam fluidized bed reactor at relatively low temperatures of around 600–800 °C. This is to ensure that metals like aluminum that may be part of the waste stream are not melted, and are successfully collected at the bottom of the gasifier. In the second phase, higher temperature gasifiers that have the capacity to deal with flows that have a significant content of solids above their melting point of 1300–1500 °C. Unlike WTE incineration which is only useful energy recovery, gasification may be used for the recovery of the chemical value of wastes. The product syngas can, therefore, be used as a feedstock in the chemical industry after adequate processing [26] . Apart the possibility of recovering chemical value, gasification is known to have several other advantages over WTE incineration. Being a partial combustion process, it only requires a fraction of the oxygen amount needed in incineration. This limits the amount of dioxins, SO2  and NOx , which reduces or eliminates the need to purchase expensive gas cleaning equipment that is needed to enhance environmental performance in incineration [26,85] . Additionally, gas generated by gasification is combustible and can be integrated with gas engines and fuel cells for electricity, among others. As far as the benefit of waste treatment is concerned, gasification is also said to fare even better than incineration in terms of reducing waste volume, with lower energy consumed [26,86] . As Ouda et al. [5]  noted, gasification can save between 1.9 and 3.8 MW per ton of waste. Though relatively nascent compared to incineration, the above-listed advantages have increased the adoption of the technology in many countries albeit on a relatively smaller scale. In the US for instance, the number of gasification plants has seen more than a 100% increase since 2010 [5] . The feedstock in gasification immensely affects its efficiency and the chemical composition of the end products. In principle, biosolids are well placed to yield greater amounts of energy. However, gasifiers that can process biosolids and treat MSW are still developing, as the most common forms of gasifiers are only suitable for treatment of sludge, serving as the main drawback of gasification. To emphasize the potential of greater energy yield with biosolids, dry materials like green waste and wood are normally mixed in sludge gasification to meet the needed characteristics for energy production [6,26] . The potential of gasification is further demonstrated by the rising prominence of its utility of Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF). While SRF is similar to RDF, they fundamentally differ in terms of the source, components and pre-processing involved. While RDF is basically composed of wastes generated from domestic and business activities, including biodegradables and plastics, SRF is a much more homogenous waste derived fuel from MSW and commercial wastes that have gone through additional pre-processing to improve quality and calorific value, and meet the European CEN/TC 343 standards [87] . It is normally composed of plastic, paper, wood, and textiles, among others. Many researchers [87–89]  have conducted studies that SRF can be conveniently gasified to produce high quality syngas, which can be utilized in energy applications. While gasification may still be relatively nascent compared to incineration, continuous advancements in the technology hold a great potential to complement modern forms of energy and support SDG number 7. Furthermore, even in its current state, the ability to process sludge without the externalities that are associated with incineration can contribute greatly to sustainable cities as stipulated by SDG in the face of exploding urban populations worldwide.  Pyrolysis Similar to gasification, pyrolysis is a process that can process waste – sewage sludge and MSW – for both energetic and chemical values. Simply, the process is an innovative and sophisticated method that manages waste through thermal degradation under high pressure in an oxygen deficient environment, or limited supply of oxidizing agent. Temperatures applied in pyrolysis can be relatively low compared to those of gasification (350–900 °C), but usually kept under 700 °C [6,26,90] . However, according to Ouda et al. [5] , a typical pyrolysis reactor is designed with a two-stage chamber in terms for temperature operation like in gasification. In the first chamber, lower temperatures are applied, while the temperature is ramped up in the second chamber to ensure complete combustion. The principal parameters driving the pyrolysis process include temperature, operating pressure and characteristics of raw materials, along with reaction time. These factors considerably affect the yields of the process of pyrolysis [6,91] . In the process of pyrolysis, there are three main products that result – pyrolysis gas, pyrolysis liquid and solid coke – depending on the method of pyrolysis and the parameters of the reaction process [26] . The process is gaining significant traction in the WTE research agenda because of its regarded relatively higher efficiency, as it has the potential to recover as much as 80% of stored energy in carbonaceous wastes [5,92] . In pyrolysis, the molecular structure of solids are altered. During this alteration, CO2  is released and causes about 40% reduction in the mass of the solids. The carbonized solids that are produced are then transformed into slurry, which is dried by applying thermal energy and converted to solid fuels in the form of pellets. The pelletized solid fuel, also known as E-fuel, can be combusted directly in gasifiers, fluidized bed incinerators and pulverized coal boilers, or deployed for alternative fuel purposes off-site [6,51] . Apart from the solid product, as noted previously, some pyrolysis processes produce liquid products or combustible gases. The gases is basically made up of CO and H2  for which reason they could be used in gas turbines, gas engines and fuel cells. Sharing some other advantages of gasification, the resultant synthesis gas can also be used as chemical feedstock. In addition, it also produces lower volume of flue gas, Nox  emissions, dioxins and furans [6,26] . The potential of pyrolysis adoption to help in production of environmentally friendly energy and contribute to sustainable cities through alternative treatment of waste in line with SDGs 7 and 11 is conspicuous and deserve to be researched and developed to eliminate bottlenecks and constraints. This is because the commercial viability of the process is saddled with a number of shortcomings. For instance, final products of pyrolysis may be unsuitable for use as secondary fuel after all if they contain high level of pollutants. Additionally, homogenizing waste streams that are typically very heterogeneous to meet the inherent stringent conditions for the pyrolysis process can incur costly pretreatment, thereby, rendering the process economically undesirable.  Biofuel technologies Biofuels are arguably the most advanced renewable source of energy to serve as alternative to fossil fuels in dealing with the global energy crisis, and as such is expected to be pivotal in the pursuit of renewable energy targets set per SDG number seven [7,93–96] . Biofuels are simply fuels that are produced from biomass, and can be the in solid, liquid or gaseous state [6] . Biofuels are produced from a myriad of feedstocks ranging from edible oil like palm oil, non-edible oil like jatropha, lignocellulosic biomass, and biological material from animals, plants, microorganisms and wastes [93,97] . The use of food and energy crops can, however, result in significant negative trade-offs in terms of GHG emissions that have thrown the whole renewable and sustainability argument of biofuels in doubt. Nevertheless, biofuels obtained from waste biomass such as traditional and urban forest residues, wastes from wood industry, food scraps and sewage sludge are still regarded as purely renewable feedstock [13,98–101] . Several types of biofuels can be produced from wastes including but not limited to bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, and biohydrogen among others [6,102] . One of the most common approaches used to process wastes into energy products is anaerobic digestion or biomethanation as presented in Figure 7  . Under anaerobic conditions, organic materials, such as the biodegradable-organic matter content of MSW and sewage sludge, are converted through microbial reactions into gases and manure [5–7,65] . The biomethanation process is a complex one that is characterized by four main stages. The first stage is hydrolysis in which complex organic materials in the form of proteins, fats and carbohydrates are converted into soluble organic materials such as sugars, and amino and fatty acids by extracellular enzymes. The second stage of the process is acidogenesis where products from the hydrolysis phase are broken down into acetate, hydrogen, and higher molecular-weight volatile fatty acids. The third stage is called acetogenesis in which products that result from acidogenesis are further processed into acetic acid, CO2  and hydrogen by acetate-forming bacteria. The last stage methanogenesis where methane and CO2  are produced from and acetic acid and H2 [5,6,103–105] . The principal component of the resultant gas is methane within which about 90% of substrates’ energies are retained. The amount of biogas generated by anaerobic digestion per ton of biodegradable waste is estimated to be about 250–350 m3 , and can be deployed for different uses such as cooking, lighting and fuel electric generators and internal combustion engines [7] . In regions like Europe, anaerobic digestion is one of the most preferred technologies for energy recovery from waste biomass, operated under two main conditions: mesophilic digestion under lower temperature conditions and longer retention time, and thermophilic digestion under higher temperature conditions and longer retention time [5,7] . The use of wastes and sewage sludge for production of biodiesel has also increasingly gained prominence research and practice in recent years around the world. In the biodiesel production process, lipids react with alcohol in the presence of a catalyst through the process of trans-esterification to produce the esters of simple alkyl fatty acids [6] . Biodiesel production from sludge is regarded as even more lucrative due the fact that oil and fats in them are saturated with energy-rich lipids, including monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, phospholipids and free fatty acids [7,106] . Biohydrogen, a product of the biological process that produces hydrogen, is considered as another form of biofuel that serves as a promising alternative to fossil fuels. By deploying suitable bioprocess technologies, wastes from agricultural and food industry that are rich in carbohydrates are used as feedstocks to produce biohydrogen [6,7] . Besides the biological pathway, hydrogen can also be produced through chemical processes. One of the main advantages of hydrogen fuel is that, as Tyagi and Lo [6]  indicates, water, rather than GHGs, is the by-product of its combustion with oxygen. Additionally, it has nearly three times the energy content embedded in hydrocarbon fuels [6,107] . The potential of utilizing wastes for energy products by biofuel technologies is established and one of the most widely adopted among the various WTE technologies. Inherent energy potential of different forms of energy has been well studied. For instance, in NACWA [51] , it was revealed that setting up CHP plants in all wastewater treatment facilities in the US would be able to power over 260,000 homes. Just focusing on the inherent energy potential of garden wastes, Shi et al. [13]  also estimated that the total potential of biofuel that could be produced from them in China is 260 petajoules (PJ), which translates into over one-fifth of the country’s urban residential electricity consumption or over 12% of gasoline used in its transport sector. Using anaerobic digestion to produce biogas also offers one of the cleanest routes in WTE as it captures methane, which is one of the potent GHGs, for fuel.   Making WTE technologies central for SDGS 7 and 11 — highlighting other accompanying benefits While renewable energy advocacy is on the increase, so is the rising mantra of “sustainable cities” as SDG number 11 seeks to achieve. Waste management is pivotal and can be the definitive difference between a sustainable city and one that is not. Given these, WTE technologies can have the dual advantage of contributing immensely to both SDG numbers one and eleven. Besides, highlighting and increasing adoption of WTE technologies in the quest to achieve the two goals may also have several concomitant benefits. There are several ways in which adopting WTEs to make good on achieving SDG number seven and 11 can benefit the countries and the world at large, and we have elaborated on some of the critical ones below. Environmental protection and benefits Due to the over-reliance on fossil fuels to sustain the global economy, the world is currently at a place where it lives under the constant threat and harsh realities of climate change. Combatting the continuous emissions of GHGs is goal of the renewable energy drive as embedded in SDG number seven [108] . Implementing WTE technologies and strategies can largely offset negative repercussions associated with burning fossil fuels and enhance waste utilization. For instance, as Psomopoulos et al. [24]  has indicated, every metric ton of waste used in WTE industry to produce electricity serves to substitute 1/4 of a ton of high quality coal or a barrel of oil, which can reduce GHGs in the US alone by about 26 million tons of CO2 . Additionally, advancing WTE in developing countries can drastically reduce the amount of woodfuels burned for energy purposes, which can in turn reduce GHG emissions from burning and forest degradation [109] . Another means through which WTE contributes to reducing GHG emissions is the capture of methane for fuel. Methane has a higher global warming potential (GWP) as it is 21 times more potent than CO2  in terms of its ability to trap heat in the atmosphere. This gas primarily escapes into the atmosphere in landfills during waste decomposition. Therefore, using anaerobic digestion to capture the gas in the form of biogas serves to produce clean energy and safe waste management and disposal [110–112] . Besides reduction in GHG emissions, WTE technologies can also have other ecological benefits. For instance, sludge is one of the richest sources of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which can be recovered in the WTE processes for other purposes. Specifically, during the process of anaerobic digestion of wastes to produce biogas, by-products such as biogas slurry, which is a high-value fertilizer alternative, is produced and can be used to fertilize agricultural soils [6,113–116] .  Health benefits and implications Developing WTE technologies and increasing their adoption can contribute to improved public health, especially in developing countries. In many developing countries, as previously alluded to, household cooking and heating is carried by burning biomass. This can cause many health problems that arise from inhalation of smoke from burning biomass. Children are especially for vulnerable to respiratory diseases caused by exposure to smoke, since they have relatively less body weight. WTE technologies such as biogas produced from waste to replace woodfuels in households will improve health of a population [117,118] . Reducing GHG emissions through the wide-scale adoption of products from WTE technologies to replace fossil fuels will contribute to mitigating climate change. The extreme weather conditions predicted under climate change scenarios are expected to come with severe health consequences, which will be minimized if the rate of climate change is reduced by the aid of WTE substituting fossil fuels. Lane et al. [119]  have predicted that climate change will likely increase floods, which are in turn likely to increase the spread of water-borne pathogens into drinking water sources and the discharge of untreated sewage into rivers and other freshwater bodies. These developments hold significant potential to adversely threaten public health, which will be minimized WTE technologies can contribute to cutting down global GHG emissions. Per the foregoing, there is little doubt that there will be significant health benefits for global populations if WTE technologies are developed to take central position in the quest to achieve SDGs number seven and eleven.  Rural development and women empowerment Wide-scale and global level deployment of WTE technologies and implementation of enabling policies can contribute to the decentralization agenda of energy production in developing countries. Being able to fill gaps in electricity production for off-grid, rural communities with electricity generated from WTE technologies via mini-grids will increase the use of renewable energy, while ensuring their development at the same time. This is because the positive relationship between energy use socioeconomic indicators is widely known [120] . Additionally, achieving breakthroughs with using wastes for household level biogas plants can contribute to women empowerment in many poor countries. In such countries where there is a fine delineation of gender roles, women are mostly in charge of the upkeep of the household including chores such as cooking. Since gathering of woodfuel to carry out this responsibility can take a toll on the quality of life that women enjoy [109,121] , women can dedicate the significant amount of time that they dedicate to other productive purposes such as education and active engagement in formal employment where they can increase their standards and quality of lives as well as that of their offspring.  Benefits of land savings Traditional landfilling demands large-scale land acquisition that is accompanied by high cost. The land requirement for landfills can also increase with time, sometimes far surpassing what is initially required. However, WTE technologies can drastically cut back on such vast land requirements, as they usually do not require more land than what is initially required. This is even besides the fact that WTE facilities generally require less amount of land to process waste as compared to landfilling [24] . Another shortcoming of landfills that can mitigated by WTE technologies is that every new landfill require a new parcel of land, meaning that lands that can be productive for other purposes must be relinquished for waste processing. Landfill sites are virtually useless after their closure. However, a new WTE plant can be sited on an already existing WTE facility, which saves the capital cost for land in every new plant. It is also worth noting that every saved land contributes to net decrease in GHG emissions released from cleared land, while also reducing formation of urban heat islands.  Recycling and recovery of heavy metals There is a huge presence of heavy metals in both MSW and sludge alike. The presence of these metals such as Zn, Ni, Cd, Pb and Hg, among others is one of the main drawbacks in WTE approaches such as incineration, since it poses a great health risk to humans and ecosystems if not properly carried out. However, when done under the right conditions, WTE technologies such as pyrolysis and incineration offer a greater chance of recycling high-grade metals from wastes [6,18] . The metal content of the resultant ash after WTE incineration is about 8–12% ferrous metals and 0.5–1.5% non-ferrous metals in both the bottom and fly ash combined, which can be readily collected under controlled conditions. In fact, nearly 80% of WTE plants in the US is said to have on-site ferrous metal recovery programs that recover over 700,000 t of metals on a yearly basis, primarily from bottom ash after combustion. Overall, these recoveries have been found to contribute to greater recycling rates for communities with WTE incineration systems than those without at about 33% and 28%, respectively [6,18,24] .  Source of innovative construction material Many authors have acknowledged the potential of converting WTE technology by-products into durable building materials. As mentioned preciously, many modern-day incineration facilities install extensive emissions control systems such as electro-filters that capture the fly ash. One of the main issues involved with the process is the appropriate disposal of the resulting ash, which contemporary technologies combines with slag from the bottom of furnace into cement and other building materials [5,26,64] . Sewage sludge is also known to be made up of substantial portions of valuable materials such as organic carbon-containing complexes and the inorganic composites, which as has been demonstrated in Japan and elsewhere that can be used successfully in building materials upon thermal solidification [6,26] . Apart from the fact that reusing by-products in construction materials helps deal with disposal issues, it is also worth noting that it also contributes to conservation of non-renewable natural resources that will otherwise be mined for construction.   Summary and priorities for research and Policy Globally, renewable energy advocacy is on the increase and their percent contribution to total energy supply has been rising in many countries and regions. However, this has had little to no impact on the total amount of fossil fuel contribution, owing to several factors including exploding global population and increased consumption patterns. Meanwhile, the growing global population is contributing to unprecedented levels of urbanization that is increasing the amounts of waste generated in cities around the world, making them unsustainable. In the SDGs, the UN dedicated goals number seven and eleven, respectively, to increasing the renewable energy share of global energy supply and making cities more sustainable, by the year 2030. While these two goals may look rather disparate on the surface, there is a common thread that connects the two: waste. When cities generate uncontrollable amounts of waste, it makes them unsustainable. However, these wastes have huge deposits of energy that can be tapped into for their renewable energy potential. For this reason, expanding WTE technologies will help to find a sustainable means of waste disposal while contributing the renewable energy development, thereby, advancing the world on the path to achieving SDGs number seven and eleven. This study has presented an in-depth appraisal of various WTE technologies along with their strengths and inherent challenges, as well as how they may affect prospects of renewable energy drive in the future. While landfilling may be least desired in the hierarchy of waste treatment options, it is still the leading means of disposal around the world and poses significant health risk to populations and ecosystems. Recycling, per LCA studies, offers the most environmentally friendly means of disposing of wastes. However, WTE presents the extra incentive of energy production that increases its overall performance in carbon savings. There are a myriad of WTE technologies currently in deployment or development around the world of which incineration is the most common, with varying levels of technological advancement. Incineration generally has lower efficiency (25–30%) when considered for only its electricity generation potential. However, current improvements and the advent of CHP with WTE incineration is drastically increasing its performance, by raising its efficiency to up to 80%. Even though the environmental and economic performance of modern-day WTE incineration has significantly increased compared to their predecessors in the 1960s and 70 s, it is still fraught with many challenges such as high levels of GHG emissions and air pollutants. The passage of MACT and the WID in the US and EU, respectively, as more stringent air quality legislations have spurred the evolution of relatively simpler incineration systems into more complex and efficient systems. These new systems have upgraded incineration technology with modern combustion systems, additional pollution control technologies and flue gas cleaning systems to meet air quality standards. Besides improvements in WTE incineration, the review has shown that the wide range of other WTE technologies such as thermal gasification and pyrolysis, as well as biogas development are ably complementing incineration and in some cases, serving as even more effective alternatives. These technologies can be applied to different forms of waste streams to achieve specific and different range of desired products. In addition, these technologies can offer greater flexibility in the energy system. Per the foregoing discussion, there is certainly a lot more room for WTE technologies to grow into the mainstream in terms of their energy production capabilities and be able to contribute to finding a lasting solution to the global waste crisis. However, the inherent potential for these objectives to be realized is apparent, especially considering the flexibility it presents with the different forms of technologies and their ability to utilize different forms of waste as raw materials and feedstock. While the SDGs may have set some very ambitious goals, it is without doubt that investing and elevating WTE technologies into the mainstream sets the world on the desired course in its drive to achieving goal numbers 7 and 11. While WTE is primed to support the current targets for renewable energy and sustainable cities as within the SDGs number 7 and 11, respectively, a wider-scale adoption of these technologies can be challenged from different perspectives. It therefore should be pursued with diligence in order to forestall any potential negative aspects. This is especially important as countries around the world have different levels of economic and technological development. In this regard, there are number of suggestions to towards making wastes central to achieving the targets set in the dual goals of SDGs number 7 and 11. First of all, exploitation of wastes for energy is still constrained with technological challenges and high operational costs. Incineration, which is the most common WTE technology, is characterized by low efficiency with its electricity generation potential. While the efficiency is improved with CHP, such efficiency may not be achieved in countries with warm climates (e.g. those in most parts of Africa), where household heating is rarely a necessity. It is therefore incumbent on developers and engineers to optimize the technology to improve its electricity generation potential to make it more attractive and economically feasible for poorer countries. In the interim, however, many less developed countries still rely on drying as a method of food preservation, so heat generated can be channeled towards artificial drying that will help to significantly cut down on food wastes. Secondly, one of the major issues that have characterized biofuel development is the phenomenon of land grabbing in developing countries and the interference of energy crops with cultivation of food crops. The 2007 food crisis is evidence of the shocks in food market that can ensue when biofuels interfere with food. These issues, aside from infringing on the fundamental human rights of some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable, also decreases the environmental performance of biofuels due to the negative trade-offs that result. It is, therefore, suggested that developed countries channel investments that optimize wastes, both MSW and sludge, as a resource for biogas and other biofuel products, to reduce the need for land for cultivation of energy crops. On another note, it is important to recognize the importance of coordination between technologically advanced countries and less advanced countries to achieve the set global goals as they pertain to renewable energy expansion. In the SDG number 7, the last target is to expand renewable energy infrastructure and technology upgrade in developing countries, in order to increase supply of modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries. This target acknowledges the need to pursue SDGs with “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” approach, where the goals are pursued with the world as a unit than as individual countries. With this said, subsidized transfer of technologies from advanced countries to developing countries is central. Since WTE technologies are farther advanced in industrialized countries, it is important that these countries support their developing counterparts to develop their capabilities by sharing their technologies and training local human resources for sustenance, maintenance, and further development of such technologies. Additionally, one of the greatest challenges that developing countries face is the electrification gap between urban and rural areas. Mostly, it is very expensive for governments to get distant, rural areas onto national grids to meet energy targets, such as those embedded with the SDGs. It will, therefore, be beneficial for governments in developing policies that support community-and-WTE-based mini-grid systems to provide such communities with electricity. This will provide viable alternatives to the placement of such areas on fossil fuel-based national grids. In many countries, governments subsidize conventional energy systems that gives it undue advantage over emerging renewable energy systems, as far as their competitiveness in the energy market is concerned. For this reason, it is imperative that governments show commitment to achieving the SDG targets by revisiting their national energy policies, in order to expand subsidies to cover renewable energies such WTE. The offer of such subsidies could have significant medium-to-long term impacts on the cost-effectiveness of mini-grids to support rural electrification. Finally, it is important to reconcile recycling and WTE in disposal of wastes. This is because of the extensive pre-processing that is required for some WTE technologies such as incineration, pyrolysis and gasification. Since the essence of the pre-processing is to eliminate low calorie materials including glasses, it will be beneficial to have recycling facilities ready to take such by-products into the recycling stream. Otherwise, such materials are more likely to go back into the waste stream.  Conflicts of interest The authors wish to declare that we have no conflicts of interest.    References [1] H. Schandl  S.
