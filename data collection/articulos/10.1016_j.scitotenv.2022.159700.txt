                  Sustainability is a very complex concept made up of a multitude of interacting aspects that do not necessarily work synergistically with each other. The consequential outcome of cross-cutting drivers, such as digitalisation, is often difficult to assess, as the achievement of certain targets may also inadvertently hinder progress towards others. This investigation describes a comprehensive and systematic country-based analysis of statistical associations between digitalization and sustainability indicators operating at three different levels (i.e., index, goal and indicators). Results showed strong correlations between the composite indices for digitalization (IDI Development Index), sustainability (SDG Index from) and economic growth (GCI and GDP). However, the analysis of lower-level indicators provides a more ambiguous picture, with 2 of the sustainability goals and 22 % of the sustainability indicators included in the SDG Index showing negative associations with digitalisation. It appears that while synergies are generated in aspects related to economic and social sustainability, trade-offs occur in areas related to environmental protection such as climate change, depletion of natural resources and waste generation due to their negative associations with existing economic development models. These structural obstacles need to be acknowledged and adequately managed in order to ensuring harmonious and integral progress towards effective sustainability.

Editor: Jurgen Mahlknecht Sustainability is a very complex concept made up of a multitude of interacting aspects that do not necessarily work synergistically with each other. The consequential outcome of cross-cutting drivers, such as digitalisation, is often difficult to assess, as the achievement of certain targets may also inadvertently hinder progress towards others. This investigation describes a comprehensive and systematic country-based analysis of statistical associations between digitalization and sustainability indicators operating at three different levels (i.e., index, goal and indicators). Results showed strong correlations between the composite indices for digitalization (IDI Development Index), sustainability (SDG Index from) and economic growth (GCI and GDP). However, the analysis of lower-level indicators provides a more ambiguous picture, with 2 of the sustainability goals and 22 % of the sustainability indicators included in the SDG Index showing negative associations with digitalisation. It appears that while synergies are generated in aspects related to economic and social sustainability, trade-offs occur in areas related to environmental protection such as climate change, depletion of natural resources and waste generation due to their negative associations with existing economic development models. These structural obstacles need to be acknowledged and adequately managed in order to ensuring harmonious and integral progress towards effective sustainability.

The same unconditional message is borne out in reports produced or commissioned by key companies and organizations from the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector (Ericsson, 2017 ; García Zaballos et al., 2019 ; Ono et al., 2017 ). These claims are linked to the ability of digital systems to accelerate innovation, promote dematerialisation and decarbonisation of our productive system, improve efficiency, facilitate access to essential services such as education and health care, support the application of sustainable development programs and strategies (ElMassah and Mohieldin, 2020 ), promote connectivity and synergies between complementary actors, contribute to economic growth, reduced income inequality (Cioacă et al., 2020 ) and promote social development. So much so that the United Nations (UN) agency for ICT (the International Telecommunication Union - ITU) states in its annual report that “ICT can help accelerate progress towards every single one of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ” (ITU, 2022 ). This has also led to the conclusion that digital poverty is undermining the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations (O’Sullivan et al., 2021 ). However, a growing number of authors are beginning to question whether these global benefits are so compelling and absolute, or whether they also may bring about negative trade-offs that need to be taken into consideration, especially with regard to environmental protection (Del Río Castro et al., 2021 ; Wu et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). The environmental sustainability of digital systems can be investigated using different approaches and methodologies. For example, attributional life cycle analyses (LCA) describe how digital systems tend to generate fewer emissions, consume less energy and have lower raw material requirements than their conventional counterparts along their value chains (e. g., virtual vs face-to-face meetings, e-books vs paper books, e-commerce vs traditional shopping, etc.) (Achachlouei and Moberg, 2015 ; Mondejar et al., 2021 ). However, this attributional approach only consider direct effects, ignoring the indirect and induced impacts associated with the ability of digital systems to transform other sectors, modify human behaviour and accelerate economic growth. It is widely recognized that the environmental performance of transversal systems (like energy, transport or digitalization) are dominated by these higher order effects, which may be evaluated using consequential analysis methodologies (Pohl et al., 2019 ; Weidema et al., 2018 ). Another way to assess the actual effect of external factors on sustainable development is through statistical analysis of key performance indicators. This approach makes it possible to identify general correlations between corresponding elements which do not necessarily relate to direct causal factors but define synergies and trade-offs that can either facilitate or hinder this transition towards sustainability. This type of analysis is facilitated by the availability of indicators produced under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainability Development (UN General Assembly, 2015 ). For instance, systematic country-based analysis of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reveals strong positive correlations between technology innovation and economic development (Pradhan et al., 2017 ), but negative associations between economically oriented goals and those focused on environmental performance (Kroll et al., 2019 ; Warchold et al., 2021 ). Additional investigations also suggest that while investments on health, income and education accelerate progress towards socioeconomic targets, they may also promote environmental destruction (Zeng et al., 2020 ). Other authors point to global trends on ecosystem loss, species extinction and climate change emissions to question whether the SDG system is jeopardising environmental sustainability through the prioritisation of social and economic objectives (Nicholson et al., 2021 ). Independent studies describe conflicting conclusions regarding the potential of digitalization to mitigate climate change. These differences stem primarily from the consideration of higher-order interactions between ICT and environmental protection. Thus, (Dong et al., 2022 ) describe how the digital economy should have the capacity to reduce global carbon emission intensity (t CO2  eq/€) but it is also responsible for higher per capita emissions due to its contribution to economic growth. While ICT projects have the capacity to mitigate CO2  emissions (Khan et al., 2020 ), such environmental savings may be offset by increased ICT sector activity, rebound effects and economic growth (Lange et al., 2020 ). Other authors describe how digitalization and CO2  emissions follow an inverted-U relationship where developing countries have yet to reach the tipping point at which increased development results in reduced impact (Añón Higón et al., 2017 ). Time series analysis (1994–2014) on emerging economies has also shown negative correlations between technology and economic development (in the form of internet usage, mobile cellular subscriptions, electricity use, financial development, etc.) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Haseeb et al., 2019 ). This context of uncertainty calls for a holistic and systematic re-examination of the associations between digitisation and the multiple aspects that shape human and natural sustainability, with the aim of identifying synergies and trade-offs that may promote or hinder this essential transition. Hence, the main objective of this research is to provide further evidence on the links between digitalisation and sustainability. This has been carried out through country based statistical analysis of indicators produced by reputable sources at three different levels (global indices, goals and indicators). In order to achieve this main objective, the following specific targets have been set out: i) define the mathematical functions and statistical relevance of the associations between synthetic indices for ICT development, SDG achievement and economic progress; ii) identify similar correlations for second level 17 sustainability goals; iii) study associations for third level 85 sustainability indicators.  2 Methodology 2.1 Data sources The data employed were obtained from official sources that provided the most updated information at the time this investigation was initiated. The selection of these sources was based on their international reputation, methodological soundness, comprehensiveness and completeness in relation to the number of countries and aspects considered in the description of both digitisation and sustainability. Sustainability data were sourced from Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solution Network (SDSN) who describe the level of achievement of the 2030 Agenda in 193 countries at three levels of aggregation (Sachs et al., 2019 ). The first level refers to the aggregated SDG Index; the second level refers to each of the 17 sustainability goals considered in the 2030 Agenda; and the third level refer to 85 specific key performance indicators. The protocols behind this methodology (in terms of data sourcing, normalization, missing data treatment, outliers, weighting, etc.) is described by (Lafortune et al., 2018 ) and it has been audited by the European Commission (Papadimitriou et al., 2019 ). Digitalization data was sourced from the ICT Development Index (IDI) published by the UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) (ITU, 2017 ). This methodology is used to monitor ICT progress in 176 countries using internationally agreed indicators. The IDI is also arranged at three levels that include an aggregated IDI Global Score, which is calculated as the weighted average of 3 aggregated scores each one describing country-based performance on ICT use, access and skills. In turn, these scores are calculated on the basis of 11 indicators describing specific measurable aspects of ICT development (e.g., number of fixed broadband subscriptions, households with a computer or mean years of schooling). Full details about the IDI methodology may be revised in (ITU, 2009 ). Additional information about the characteristics, scope and statistical significance of the digitalization and sustainability data used in this investigation has been included in the Supplementary Information. Country based data on economic development were collected from the Global Competitive Index (GCI), as included in the Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum (Klaus Schwab, 2019 ). The methodology behind this data may be revised in (Sala-i-Martin and Artadi, 2004 ). Additional generic data such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or national population were sourced from (World Bank, 2022 ).  2.2 Statistical analysis A country-based cross-section approach was carried out to evaluate associations between sustainability, digitalization and economic development at three different levels (indices, goals and indicators). Regression analyses were modelled initially using a linear bivariate regression.SDG i  = β 0  + β 1  ICT i  + ε i   i = 1 … n     SDG i   represents the SDG indicator (index, goal score, target) for country i , ICT i   is the digitalization indicator (IDI global score, indicator, sub indicator) for country i , n is the number of considered countries, β 0  and β 1 are the regression coefficients and ε i   is the error term for country i . The regression coefficients were calculated using the least squared approach to minimize the square sum of the error terms.∑ i = 1  n  ε i 2      From this linear regression, the correlation coefficient (r), the determination coefficient (R2 ) and the sensitivity of the SDG i   indicator to the variations in the ICT i   indicator (β 1 ) were obtained. The p -values were calculated to determine the statistical significance of the associations, considering in the analyses only regressions with p-values below 0.05. In cases where the relationship between the SDG and the ICT indicators were strongly nonlinear, nonlinear regressions were determinedSDG i  = f β 0  … β p  ICT i   + ε i   i = 1 … n    where f  is the nonlinear regression function and β 0 , …, β p   represent the regression coefficients, which are also calculated using the least squared approach to minimize the square sum of the error terms. Table 1   shows the bivariate regression functions tested in this investigation. For nonlinear regressions, determination coefficients (R2 ) were obtained as an indicator of the quality of the regression model to fit the relationship between such indicators. Best-fit non-linear functions were determined as the difference between the least-squares of the determination coefficients (R nonlinear  2  − R linear  2 ).   3 Results and discussion The structure of this research follows a top-down approach, starting with the analysis of composite indices in Section 3.1 , followed by second lower-level sustainability goals in Section 3.2 , and then third lower-level SDG and digitalization indicators in Section 3.3 . 3.1 Associating digitalization, sustainability and economic development indices The results in Table 2   show strong correlations (r) between the aggregated indices used to describe sustainability (SDG), digitalization (IDI) and economic development (GCI for competitiveness and GDP for economic growth). This suggests that digitalization acts as a proxy for other aspects of development. The analysis of these indices also show that digitalization has slightly stronger correlations with economic development than with sustainability. Fig. 1   graphically illustrates this strong association between the IDI and the SDG indices, which fit a biexponential function with a determination coefficient (R2 ) of 0.86. This function defines two behavioural zones: the first one at lower digitalisation levels shows a steeper slope, which suggests more rapid sustainability gains in less developed countries (corresponding primarily to sub-Saharan African, marked in red). The second, at IDI > 3–4 approximately, follows a more linear trend where digitalization favours sustainability at a consistent but slower pace. South American countries (in green) occupy the middle of the curve, while European (yellow) and North America (blue) countries occupy leading positions. White dots correspond to countries not included in any of these four categories. Certain countries deviate from the general trend (either upwards or downwards), which may be due to their political, historical, cultural or technological context. For instance, Tanzania, Cuba, Ecuador and Scandinavian countries achieve higher levels of sustainability than those corresponding to their degree of digitalisation. The opposite is observed in other countries like Nigeria, Namibia, Venezuela, Qatar, Israel, the USA o Luxemburg. Fig. 2   provide additional insight into the geographical differences observed in the four development aspects considered in this investigation: digitalization (IDI), sustainability (SDG) and economic development (GCI and GDP). The results show a reasonable consistency in the rankings, with some exceptions. For instance, Europe is found to lead the rankings in terms of sustainability (SDG index) while it is outperformed by North America in the other three digitalization and economic based composite indices. In contrast, Oceania ranks second in digitalization and economic development (GCI) but falls to the fifth place in terms of sustainability. South America's performance in terms of digitalization and sustainability is higher than it should be in relation to their economic development while the opposite may be observed for Central America. Sub-Saharan countries lag behind by far in all indices.  3.2 Associating digitalization with the 17 SDG scores This section describes a statistical analysis of linear and non-linear associations between digitalization and lower-level sustainability scores. This refers to each of the 17 sustainability goals that make the SDG index and the 15 digitalization indicators that make the IDI index (including IDI global score, 3 s level IDI indicators (access, use and skills) and 11 third level sub-indicators). A comprehensive numerical analysis of these results and a complete graphical country-based representation of these associations has been included in the Supplementary Information. Fig. 3   (a) shows the heatmap of Pearson correlations coefficient (r) between the sustainability goals and the digitalization indicators. Blank cells in the map correspond to no discernible linear associations (p -values >0.05), while red and blue cells identify negative and positive correlations, respectively (p-values <0.05). A general observation to these results describes a dominance of SDG factors (over digitalization) in the definition of the correlations coefficients, as horizontal lines tend to have a more uniform colour than vertical lines. This is due to a comparatively stronger linkages between the indicators used to build the ICT Development Index and the more diverse nature of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, the analysis reveals strong correlations for 87 % of the coefficients (223 over a total of 255), of which 193 are positive (70 % over 0.5, 37 % over 0.7 and 13 % over 0.8) and 30 are negative (6 % under −0.5, 3 % under −0.8). The SDG scores showing the strongest positive correlations with the digitalization indicators are SDG1 (No poverty), SDG3 (Good health), SDG4 (Quality education), SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG9 (Industry innovation and infrastructure) and SDG16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). For their part, SDG2 (Aero hunger), SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth) and SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) show a medium level of positive correlation and SDG5 (Gender equality), SDG10 (Reduce inequality) and SDG17 (partnership to achieve the goal) show a weak positive correlation. In contrast, no discernible linear correlations may be observed between digitalization indicators and SDG14 (Life below water) and SDG15 (Life on land) while the correlations with SDG13 (Climate action) and particularly SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) are distinctly negative. These results are in conflict with the statements made by international organizations and companies in the ICT sector (Ericsson, 2017 ), which describe a univocal association between digitalisation and sustainability (ECLAC, 2021 ; ITU, 2022 ; Mas et al., 2018 ; OECD, 2016 ; World Bank, 2016 ) and align with the more cautious voices that identify trade-offs, particularly with sustainability issues related to environmental protection and climate change (Del Río Castro et al., 2021 ; Wu et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). These results also recognize the synergies and trade-off that may exist between goals pertaining to different aspects of sustainability, as reported by (Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Warchold et al., 2021 ). Fig. 3  (b) shows the sensitivity of the 17 sustainability goals to changes in the IDI indicators, as defined by the slope of their linear regression functions. Please note that SDG and IDI indicators are formulated in such a way that a higher value always indicates better compliance. The analysis of sustainability factors (horizontal lines) shows strong positive sensitivities in economically and socially oriented sustainability goals such as SDG1 (No hunger), SDG3 (Good health and Well-being), SDG4 (Quality education), SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG9 (Industry innovation and infrastructure). In contrast, digitalization shows a negative sensitivity with the environmentally oriented SDG 13 (Climate action) and most notably with SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production). Positive sensitivities describe the existence of synergistic effects where the digitalization facilitates the achievement of sustainability goals, while negative sensitivities describe trade-offs where digital deployment hinders the achievement of sustainability. A technical report by the ICT company Huawei already describes positive associations between digitalization and a selection of SDGs, in particular SDG3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG4 (Quality Education), suggesting that these are the areas where ICT has the highest potential to improve sustainability. Surprisingly, this publication does not mention the existence of non-discernible or negative associations with environmental oriented SDGs (Huawei, 2019 ). The analysis of digitalization factors (vertical lines) is less compelling, although it is possible to observe a certain dominance in IDI 1.3 (Internet International bandwidth). This indicator describes a stronger sensitivity (influence) than other digitalization indicators for most sustainability goals, following the same general trend of being positive for social and economic aspects, and negative for environmental indicators. The opposite may be observed for IDI 1.2 (Mobile cellular subscriptions), which appears to have a comparatively weaker sensitivity with all SDGs than other digitalization indicators. As described, the statistical analyses in Fig. 3  (a) and Fig. 3  (b) focus solely on linear regression between SDG and digitalization, an approach that may overlook other types of non-linear associations. To investigate these equally important correspondences, determination coefficients were also calculated using the functions described in Table 1 . The heatmap in Fig. 3  (c) shows the differences between the determination coefficients calculated using linear and nonlinear regressions (R nonlinear  2  − R linear  2 ). A high colour intensity describes a strong nonlinear correspondence, while a blank cell identifies the linear regression as the best fit. For the former case, Fig. 3  (d) describes the type of nonlinear function that maximized the determination coefficient (R 2  ) in each case. The results show that while linear regression provides a reasonably accurate description in the majority of cases, it clearly underestimates the associations between certain digitalization and sustainability indicators in some others, primarily in the case of SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 4 (Quality of education), SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities) and SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities). The analysis of the digitalization factors (vertical columns in Fig. 3  c and Fig. 3  d) identifies two indicators (IDI1.1 Fixed broadband and IDI2.2 Telephony subscriptions) as those describing a dominant nonlinear association with most SDGs. Most non-linear associations are of the biexponential type (61), while only 17 follow a logistic function and 2 are of the logarithmic type. The form of these mathematical functions describes the relationship between digitalisation and sustainability indicators. Thus, the logistic function describes a sigmoidal curve where sustainability scores rise at different rates with digitalization to reach a limiting value that usually corresponds to 100 % achievement of SDG. The logarithmic function shows a rapid growth in sustainability scores with digitalization to reach an asymptotic maximum that defines a saturation level. The biexponential function is capable of adapting to multiple data distributions. Fig. 4   provides six representative examples of country-by-country diagrams describing the associations between sustainability goals and the IDI global score (note that this corresponds to the first column in Fig. 3  diagrams). A complete list of the 17 SDGs, together with the mathematical functions that best fit each of these cases, has been included in the Supplementary Information. The SDG 1 (No poverty) diagram is an example sigmoidal shape association where a certain degree of digitalization (IDI score > 5–6) appears to be an essential requirement to achieve SDG scores above 90 %. The chart for SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG 8 (Decent jobs and economic growth) are examples of linear associations, where a continuous improvement in the SDG score is observed with the degree of digitisation. The slope of this straight line defines the sensitivity between the two parameters under assessment. The SDG 9 (Innovation and infrastructures) diagram follows a biexponential association (see Fig. 3 ) with the IDI global score, showing how digitalization accelerates the achievement of this goal. The charts for SDG 12 (Responsible consumption) and SDG 13 (Climate action) are examples of negative associations between the achievement of environmentally oriented sustainability goals and the IDI global score. In the first case this relationship is biexponential and in the second case linear. In all cases, the area below the fitting curves is occupied by countries that achieve lower scores than would be expected for their degree of digitalization, while the opposite applies to countries located above the fitting curve.  3.3 Associating digitalization with the 85 SDG sub indicators Fig. 5   illustrates the statistical associations between the 85 third-level indicators that make the SDG Index and the digitalization scores that make the IDI Index. These results clearly describe the diversity of responses to an external element such as digitisation in the many aspects that make up sustainability. As reported by (Kroll et al., 2019 ), some of these responses may not be the direct result of digitalization activities, but may be conditioned by indirect interactions between different sustainability aspects (e.g., economic growth or industrial activity inducing increased emissions or use of natural resources). More specifically, the results in Fig. 5  (a) show that 1183 out of the 1275 correlation coefficients are statistically significant (p -value < 0.05). Seventy eight percent of these statistically significant correlations are positive (52 % r  > 0.5 and 25 % r  > 0.7) while the remaining 22 % are negative (9 % r  < −0.5 and 2 % r  < −0.7). These results suggest that while digitalization is associated with an improvement in the majority of the 85 sustainability targets, there is also evidence of negative trade-offs in a not inconsiderable number of sustainability aspects. A general observation is that the behaviour of specific sustainability indicators within the same development goal is not always homogeneous. For example, it may be observed that two of the indicators that make SDG 14 (Life below water) (14.1. Mean area that is protected in marine sites and 14.2 Ocean Health Index Goal – Clean Waters) show positive correlations with nearly all digitalization indicators while the other two (14.3 Percentage of fish stocks overexploited and 14.4. Fish caught by trawling) describe negative correlations. Similarly counteractive effects may be observed in the indicators that make SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 13 (Climate action). In contrast, a more homogeneously positive response to digitalization may be observed in some goals such as SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), and a homogeneously negative response is observed in SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production). The results also show a dominance of sustainability over digitalization aspects (horizontal lines tend to have more homogeneous colours than vertical lines). As explained above, this may be associated with the more diverse nature of the sustainability indicators. The exception to this is digital indicator IDI1.3. (International Internet Bandwidth), that appears to define stronger sensitivities with nearly all sustainability indicators. This suggests the existence of synergies between international internet connectivity and transition towards SDG achievement (or underachievement), depending on the original direction of this interaction. Although the large number of third-level indicators considered in the SDG Index and the IDI Index does not allow for a detailed analysis of each of the associations described in Fig. 5 , the following sections provide an analysis of the most relevant findings. 3.3.1 SDG1. No poverty Fig. 6   illustrates the country-based nonlinear associations between the two indicators used to define the SDG1 (No poverty) and the IDI global score. The charts show a clearly positive relationship between digitalization and both SDG1.1 and SDG1.2, which represent the poverty headcount ratio at $1.90/day and $3.20/day, respectively. This association takes the form of a biexponential function in the case of SDG1.1 and a logistic function in the case of SDG1.2. The results evidence that IDI global score ratings above 3 are required to reach SDG1.1 score above 80–90 %, while IDI global score ratings above 6 are required to reach similar compliance in the more stringent SDG1.2.  3.3.2 SDG2. Zero hunger SDG2 (Zero hunger) third level indicators have a mixed correspondence with digitalization. While those indicators related to the prevalence of under nourishment (SDG2.1), stunting (SDG2.2) and wasting (SDG2.3), cereal yield (SDG2.5) or sustainable nitrogen management (SDG2.6) show a strong positive linear relationship with digitalization (r  > 0.79 with respect to IDI global score), prevalence of obesity (SDG2.4) and human trophic level (SDG2.6) indicators describe a strong negative correlation (r  < −0.6 and −0.8 with respect to the IDI global score). Surprisingly, the combination of these opposing trends resulted in a linear relationship between the SDG2 (No hunger) score and the IDI global score, as shown in Fig. 3 . Fig. 7   (a) shows that the indicator SDG2.1 (Prevalence of undernourishment) is above 90 % in most countries with IDI global scores above 4. In contrast, Fig. 7  (b) illustrates how SDG2.6 (Human trophic level) shows a linear negative behaviour with digitalization, which describes a tendency to over-consume energy intensive animal-based foodstuffs in the most digitized countries.  3.3.3 SDG3. Good health and well-being Most of the third level indicators associated with SDG3 (Good health and well-being) show very strong positive correlations with the IDI global score, and several of them have the highest values in the heatmap. As shown in Fig. 8  , SDG3.13 (Universal Health Coverage Tracer Index) has a correlation coefficient with an IDI global score of 0.94.  3.3.4 SDG4. Quality education SDG4 (Quality of education) also showed strong positive correlations with digitalization, although the mathematical functions describing the evolution in behaviour of its three third level indicators were different from each other (see Fig. 9  ). While SDG4.1 (Net primary enrolment rate) followed a linear relationship with the IDI global score, this association followed a logistic function for SDG4.2 (percentage of secondary education completion rate) and a biexponential function in the case of SDG4.3 (percentage of youth, aged between 15 and 24 years old, who can both read and write a short simple statement on everyday life with understanding). The SDG4.2 and SDG4.3 sub indicators show the highest correlation (0.79 and 0.77, respectively). While most countries with an IDI global score above 4 have achieved 90 % of SDG4.3, higher digitalization levels are required to achieve similar levels of compliance with the other two indicators.  3.3.5 SDG5. Gender equality SDG5 (Gender equality) is composed of four third level indicators. Two of them, SDG5.1 (Demand for family planning satisfied) and SDG5.2 (Ratio of female to male mean years of schooling) have strong positive correlations with digitalization (0.52 and 0.69 vs. IDI global score). In contrast, SDG5.3 (Ratio of female to male labour force participation) shows no significant correlation while SDG5.4 (Seats held by women in national parliaments) show very low correlation values (<0.24 for all the IDI indicators).  3.3.6 SDG6. Clean water and sanitation SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation indicators) is based on five third level indicators with very differing behaviours with respect to digitalization. Thus, three of them (SDG6.1 Population using at least basic drinking water services, SDG6.2 population using at least basic sanitation services and SDG6.5 percentage of anthropogenic wastewater that receives treatment) show a strong positive correlation and a high sensitivity with digitalization. By contrast, the other two (SDG6.3 Freshwater withdrawal and SDG6.4 Imported groundwater depletion) showed weak negative correlations, indicating that technological progress negatively impacts these two sustainability aspects. Despite this discrepancy, the SDG6 score shows a relatively strong linear relationship with the IDI global score, as described in Fig. 3 .  3.3.7 SDG7. Affordable and clean energy SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) consist of three third level indicators. Two of them (SDG7.1 Access to electricity and SDG7.2 Access to clean fuels & technology for cooking) show relatively strong nonlinear positive associations with digitalization, similar to that observed for the SDG7 score. However, the third indicator (SDG7.3 CO2  emissions from fuel combustion/electricity output), which is related to the carbon intensity of energy production, shows a very weak correlation with digital development. This may be due to the opposing effect of less developed countries utilizing more energy whatever the source, while more developed countries becoming more energy efficient and reliant on renewable sources.  3.3.8 SDG8. Decent work and economic growth The five third level indicators that make SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) show very heterogeneous correspondences with digitalization. Only SDG8.3 (adults with an account at a bank or other financial institution or with a mobile-money service provider) has a strong positive correlation with digitalization (0.84). Two of the others (SDG8.1 Adjusted growth and SDG8.2 Prevalence of modern slavery) show weak correlations that take the form of biexponential associations. In contrast, SDG8.4 (Unemployment rate) show no discernible association while SDG8.5 (fatal work-related accidents embodied in imports) has a negative correlation (−0.49) with digital development. Despite these discrepancies, the analysis of the SDG8 score vs. IDI suggests an overall linear relationship between these two categories.  3.3.9 SDG9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure The SDG9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) score showed a very strong correlation coefficient with digitalization (0.92), with all six third level indicators revealing similarly homogeneous behaviours. This is partially due to the fact that two of the six sub indicators are directly related to the deployment of internet technologies (SDG9.1 Population using the internet and SDG9.2 Mobile broadband subscriptions). The other three sub indicators that make this SDG9 also show strong positive correlations with digital development.  3.3.10 SDG10. Reduced inequality SDG10 (Reduce inequalities) third level indicators shows a low correlation coefficient with digitalization. The Palma ratio (SDG10.2) and the Gini coefficient (SDG10.1) indicators, adjusted for top income earners as described in Chandy and Seidel (2017) , showed correlation coefficients between 0.21 and 0.50 for the different IDI indicators.  3.3.11 SDG11. Sustainable cities and communities SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) is based on only two third level indicators (SDG11.1 improved water source and SDG11.2 public transport satisfaction), which only cover a very limited scope in the aspects that may influence this issue. SDG11.1 showed correlations between 0.42 and 0.68 for the different IDI indicators, while SDG12.2 ranged between 0.19 and 0.42.  3.3.12 SDG12. Responsible consumption and production SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) is based on six third level indicators (SDG12.1 municipal solid waste, SDG12.2 electronic waste, SDG12.3 production based SO2  emissions, SDG12.4 imported SO2 emissions, SDG12.5 nitrogen production footprint and SDG12.6 net imported emissions of reactive nitrogen) closely related to the preservation of the natural environment. Fig. 10   shows a clearly negative association between digitalization and progress on each of these issues. SDG12.2 (Electronic waste) is the indicator showing the strongest negative correlation with digitalization (−0.9). To expand on the detrimental effects of digitalization on SDG12, Fig. 11   shows a world map describing the e-waste production per capita (SDG12.2) in different countries, together with a graph showing this same indicator as a function of Internet penetration. The results show that increasing internet penetration is associated with an exponential growth in electronic waste. The average amount of waste generated by countries with Internet penetration below 30 % is 10 times lower than for countries with penetration rates above 70 %.  3.3.13 SDG13. Climate action SDG13 (Climate action) describes the progress the countries are making towards combating climate change and its impacts. Fig. 12   shows the level of achievement of the different countries as a function of the IDI global score for the three SDG13 third level indicators related to CO2  emissions. SDG13.1 (Energy related CO2  emissions) shows the highest negative correlation coefficient (−0.65). It may be observed that there are many countries, independent of their level of digitalization, that have already met the target for imported and exported CO2  (SDG 13.2 and SDG13.4). However, that is not the case for energy related CO2  emissions, where only countries with a low level of digitalization are close to achieving those goals. To expand on the detrimental effects of digitalization on SDG13, Fig. 13   illustrates how the CO2  emissions per capita in areas with high internet penetration are on average >8 times higher than those in areas with low Internet penetration (1.2 vs. 10.4 tons per capita). These results align with those reported by (Dong et al., 2022 ) who described higher per capita CO2  emissions in more digitalized countries, despite the reduced carbon emission intensity (per unit of economic output), which has been attributed to economic growth, rebound effects and increased ICT sector activity (Khan et al., 2020 ; Lange et al., 2020 ). Emissions are produced in a very limited number of geographic areas. China, the USA and Europe account for >50 % of the total emissions. Only 10 geographic areas produce 77 % of the total CO2  emissions.  3.3.14 SDG14. Life below water SDG14 (Life below water) produced a non-statistically significant correlation coefficient with the IDI global score (see Fig. 3  (a)). The statistical behaviours of the four indicators used to quantify this goal are very heterogeneous. The two sub indicators that describe fish exploitation (SDG14.3 Percentage of Fish Stocks overexploited or collapsed by Exclusive Economic Zone and SDG14.4 Fish caught by trawling) exhibit negative correlations (between −0.36 and −0.21 for the first and −0.49 and −0.29 for the second) with digital development. The other two indicators related to water pollution or the establishment of marine protection areas (SDG14.1 The mean area that is protected in marine sites and SDG14.2 The ocean Health Index) show a positive correlation coefficient (values between 0.2 and 0.41).  3.3.15 SDG15. Life on land SDG15 (Life on land) has a non-statistically significant correlation with the IDI global score, as it may be seen in Fig. 3 (a). All sub indicators have low positive correlations (between 0.16 and 0.44) except SDG15.5 (Imported biodiversity threats), which produced a medium-negative correlation level (−0.62). Fig. 14   illustrates the antagonistic association that sustainability sub indicators SDG15.4 and SDG15.5 have with digital development.  3.3.16 SDG16. Peace, justice and strong institutions SDG16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) has a strong positive correlation with the ICT global score (0.8). The first three indicators (SDG16.1 Homicides, SDG 16.2 Unsentenced detainees and SDG16.3 Proportion of the population who feel safe) show medium or low positive correlation values (between 0.18 and 0.57). Four of the nine indicators (SDG16.4 Property rights protection, SDG16.5 Birth registrations with civil authority, SDG16.6 Corruption perception index and SDG16.7 Percentage of children involved in child labour) show high correlation values over 0.68. However, indicator SDG16.8 related to the transfer of major conventional weapons has a negative correlation (up to −0.59) with digital development.  3.3.17 SDG17. Partnerships to achieve the goals The SDG17 (Partnerships to Achieve the Goals) has a low correlation coefficient with the IDI global score. The Tax Haven Score indicator (SDG17.4) has a negative correlation, but in this case most countries have a 100 % accomplishment rate and only a small number of countries are responsible for this statistical result. The higher positive correlation exhibited by indicator 17.2 (International concessional public finance as percentage of the gross national income) is not significant because only a very small number of countries characterised by a high level of digitalisation report on this parameter.   3.4 Limitations and future investigations The limitations of this study are related to the selection of indicators and the methodology used to quantify the scores at different levels. A recent publication by (Warchold et al., 2022 ) describes how SDG data selection may lead to diverse findings and proposes a unified SDG database that combines those published by United Nations (SD, 2020 ), the World Bank Group (WBG) (World Bank, 2020 ) and the Bertelsmann Stiftung & Sustainable Development Solutions Network (BE-SDSN) (Sachs et al., 2019 ). Hence, a future line of investigation could focus on the use of this unified database once it is endorsed and validated by the scientific community. Another limitation relates to the currency of the data used to describe the levels of digital and sustainable development. This investigation used data from the ICT Development Index (IDI) (ITU, 2017 ) for digitalization and from the SDG Index (Sachs et al., 2019 ) for sustainability, which were the most updated and reliable at the time the investigation was initiated. Since then, the sustainability index has been updated yearly while the ICT index has not been revised since 2017. One problem with using more up-to-date sustainability data is that from 2020 onwards they incorporate deviations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that could alter normal trends. In any case, a preliminary analysis has been carried out with first grade indicators from the 2021 SDG Index and it has been observed that there are no significant changes with the results obtained using 2019 data. A complementary line of research to the one developed in this study would be related to the use of a temporal (rather than geographical) analysis scheme. This approach will face problems related to the availability of sufficiently large time series for sustainability data and, above all, for digitisation. Another line of research of great interest would be to justify the reasons (technological, political, historical, cultural, geographical) that lead certain countries to break away from the general trends. This would allow defining whether there are different digitisation routes that could optimise global and specific achievements within the SDGs.   4 Conclusions • A country-based analysis show strong associations between synthetic indices describing digitization (IDI global index), sustainability (SDG Index), economic progress (GDP) and competitiveness (GCI). The synergistic effects of digitalization with economic development appear to be comparatively stronger than with sustainability.  • However, the analysis of lower-level sustainability goals and indicators provides a more ambiguous and inhomogeneous view. While the majority of sustainability goals and indicators show positive synergistic associations with digitalization, this is not a univocal situation. Lower-level indicators within specific sustainability goals often follow antagonistic behaviours with respect to their evolution with digitalization.  • Two of the sustainability goals and 22 % of the third level indicators used to build the SDG Index describe negative associations with digitalization.  • In general, strong positive associations are related to social and economic targets and goals, including poverty reduction, health care, quality of education and industry improvement. Negative associations are associated with environmental protection goals included in SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG13 (Climate action).  • These results suggest that direct environmental savings caused the capacity of digital systems to decarbonize and dematerialize the economy may be offset by increased ICT sector activity and higher order consequences related to economic growth, enhanced consumption and other rebound effects.  • While it would be ill-advised to ignore the benefits that digital and technological development bring to social and economic development, it is also essential to be aware of its associated environmental costs. These results suggest that digitalization is still not able to provide an effective decoupling between economic growth and environmental damage.  • Harmonic sustainable development requires the application of additional measures for environmental protection aimed primarily at fighting against climate change, minimising the use of natural resources and reducing waste generation. The importance of this approach is underlined by the 3 billion people who do not yet have access to the internet in Africa and Asia, and the strong population growth expected in these areas in the coming decades.
