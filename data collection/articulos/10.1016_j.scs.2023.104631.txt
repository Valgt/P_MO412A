                  The combined effects of climate change and accelerated urbanization have increased the risk of urban rainstorm and flood disasters, which seriously affects the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in cities. Improving urban flood resilience is one of main ways to deal with flooding. This study established an urban rainstorm and flood resilience model to sort out the behavioral mechanisms of multiple subjects (government, flood control department, residents and media) and the internal action mechanisms from different dimensions (economic, social, natural, infrastructure and information) of urban rainstorm and flood resilience using system dynamics approach, and to investigate the urban rainstorm and flood resilience in Xi'an city. The results show that the damage losses rate reduced by 44.44%, 10.8%, 9.48% and 3.37% by improving flood resilience, resident engagement, government attention degree and information construction level, respectively. The degree of improvement of urban rainstorm and flood resilience varied for six development scenarios when predict flood resilience. The development pattern can be divided into the beginning phase, preparation phase and development phase, and three improvement strategies are proposed based on the development pattern of flood resilience. This study helps to provide refined strategies for urban rainstorm and flood resilience assessment construction.

Improving urban flood resilience is one of main ways to deal with flooding. This study established an urban rainstorm and flood resilience model to sort out the behavioral mechanisms of multiple subjects (government, flood control department, residents and media) and the internal action mechanisms from different dimensions (economic, social, natural, infrastructure and information) of urban rainstorm and flood resilience using system dynamics approach, and to investigate the urban rainstorm and flood resilience in Xi'an city. The results show that the damage losses rate reduced by 44.44%, 10.8%, 9.48% and 3.37% by improving flood resilience, resident engagement, government attention degree and information construction level, respectively. The degree of improvement of urban rainstorm and flood resilience varied for six development scenarios when predict flood resilience. The development pattern can be divided into the beginning phase, preparation phase and development phase, and three improvement strategies are proposed based on the development pattern of flood resilience. This study helps to provide refined strategies for urban rainstorm and flood resilience assessment construction.

Global warming has affected the local climate characteristics of the city, resulting in more frequent and short-duration heavy rainfall (Yin et al., 2015 ). Urbanization construction produces a significant amount of domestic and industrial heat that causes instability in the urban atmosphere, causing “urban heat island” and “urban rain island” effects, thus increasing the risk of urban rainstorm and flooding (Su et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ), which raises numerous threats including high-intensity rainfall event and waterlogging, etc (Liao et al., 2016 ). Urban rainstorm and flood events have caused severe casualties, economic losses, social and environmental damage, restricting the sustainable development of cities (Yin et al., 2016 ; Lyu et al., 2018 ; Büyüközkan et al., 2022 ). For the last decade, an annual number of more than 100 cities in China suffered from urban rainstorm and flooding (Wu et al., 2021 ). For example, in China, 78.615 million people were affected by floods, and the direct economic loss amounted to 266.98 billion yuan in 2020. Extraordinary rainstorm and flood event hit Zhenzhou city, Henan province on July 20, 2021, caused 380 deaths. Urban rainstorm and flood disasters have already become one of the most important risks to human survival and social development (Aerts et al., 2014 ). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were proposed by the United Nations as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030 (The United Nations, 2015 ). Among these goals, innovation and infrastructure (SDG9), sustainable cities and communities (SDG11) and climate action (SDG13) are closely related to urban rainstorm and flood resilience governance. Chinese government proposed to build “resilient cities” in the national development plan for the first time in 2020, which required to improve the ability to absorb, recover and prepare for future shocks, and to cope with major disasters such as rainstorm and floods. Urban rainstorm and flood events are characterized by natural and social impacts, such as frequency, suddenness and uncertainty. As cities are centers of social and economic activities, rainstorm and flood disaster can affect the security of urban and residents. While no cities are completely immune to the effects of unforeseen sudden-onset disasters, they can become more resilient to such destructive forces (Büyüközkan et al., 2022 ). Urban rainstorm and flood resilience can be defined as the ability of a city to maintain its current steady state when subjected to heavy rainfall and flooding (Holling, 1973 ; Bertilsson et al., 2019 ). Hence, how to increase urban flood resilience against rainstorm and flood disasters to reduce disaster risk and losses is of great significance for resilient cities construction (Jia & Wu, 2020 ). Currently, urban flood resilience has become a fundamental feature of sustainable urban development. There had been various studies focusing on the urban flood resilience, mainly including subjective experience and objective analysis (Bertilsson et al., 2019 ). The research emphasis has been changed from flood vulnerability or flood risk (Rahman et al., 2016 ; Yang et al., 2018 ) to flood resilience assessment and simulation (Chen et al., 2021 ; Zhu et al., 2021 ). The subjective empirical method mainly includes a questionnaire survey and literature analysis (Samsuddin et al., 2018 ; Forrest et al., 2020 ). For example, Li et al. (2019)  used hesitant fuzziness to experts’ linguistic terms to deal with subjective vagueness and built a comprehensive flood resilience evaluation system with the whole period of the disaster cycle. Based on relevant research results and government documents, Lu et al. (2022)  conducted a systematic review of urban flooding and road transport disruptions. The objective analysis mainly includes a variety of methods (Moura Rezende et al., 2019 ). For example, Ruan et al. (2021)  established a quantitative evaluation model for the spatial and temporal resilience of Guangzhou city under different rainstorm and flood situations, in considering of urban economy, society and ecological aspects. Wu et al. (2022)  proposed a new approach to evaluate urban flood control options, creating a methodological framework to improve the resilience of urban flood control systems. The framework considers the use of numerical urban flood models that can simulate the hydrological processes of urban response to rainfall events. The above studies have contributed significantly to the assessment system of urban rainstorm flood resilience. However, previous studies have ignored the process feature of “resilience”, and it is hard to understand the mechanism of urban flood resilience at a theoretical level, or identify the weak links in the process of resilience function, which will lead to bias in subsequent resilience assessment and resilience optimization. The existing studies on urban flood resilience usually separate urban flood scenario models from different urban socio-economic conditions. One approach focuses on real-time modeling, but with less consideration on the social or economic aspect (Sado-Inamura & Fukushi, 2019 ). For example, Wang et al. (2020)  studied the spatial-temporal patterns of public responses to a flooding event based on a new approach of fusing social media data, land use data and other information. Another approach considers the macro urban situation with no consideration of real-time flood scenarios or simulations. Many researchers believe that cities need a combination of economic resilience, social resilience, infrastructure resilience and material and energy resilience. These major areas of resilience comprise the urban resilience framework (Li et al., 2020 ; Amirzadeh et al., 2022 ). For example, Moghadas et al. (2019)  established a multi-criteria for urban flood resilience assessment using indicators of social, economic, institutional, infrastructure, community and environmental aspects. Rana et al. (2021)  used primary data to quantify the resilience of flood-prone urban communities and explored urban resilience from social, economic, infrastructural, institutional, natural and psychological resilience perspectives. However, city is a complex system involving social, economic, natural and infrastructure integration, where multiple interactions exist among different influencing factors. Urban rainstorm and flood resilience needs to consider not only urban systems construction, but also the role of the behaviors of different subjects on flood resilience under dynamic rainstorm scenarios. Many studies have proposed urban flood resilience assessment framework from different perspectives, but they are still in the static assessment of the current situation or history of urban flood resilience, without quantitative analysis of the feedback relationships among different influencing factors within the urban flood resilience system, which makes it difficult to predict the uncertain urban rainstorm and flood resilience system. In contrast, the system dynamics (SD) approach has advantages to study complex systems with nonlinear, multiple feedback control and the mechanism of inter-factor action. SD is a modelling method of system engineering, which aims to reveal the inner mechanism of complex systems. SD can describe complex systems based on complexity, interconnectivity, and dynamic behavior over time. The function of elucidating causal relationships within a system makes the system dynamics model (SDM) particularly suitable for simulating the evolution of urban rainstorm and flood resilience (O'Keeffe et al., 2022 ; Datola et al., 2022 ). To address above issues, the main objectives of this study include: (i) Taking into account the temporal pattern of urban rainstorm response and urban flood resilience, this study establishes a system dynamics model to quantitatively analyze the complex structure and dynamic behavior of the urban rainstorm and flood resilience system. (ii) Using sensitivity analysis and scenario-setting methods, the interaction mechanisms of urban rainstorm and flood resilient is clarified. (iii) The self-regulation ability of urban systems to storm flooding under heavy rainfall scenarios is assessed, and the weak links of urban flood resilience are quickly identified. Compared with previous studies, the scientific contributions of this study are mainly reflected in the following: Firstly, this study establishes an urban rainstorm and flood resilience framework with reference to SDG9, SDG11, SDG13 and their subgoals, which provides a replicable and universal research framework for similar urban clusters and expands the vision of global realization of SDGs. Secondly, based on the theory of the Multi-Agent System (MAS) simulation framework, this study compares the behavioral mechanisms of multiple subjects, including government, flood control department, residents, and media, in urban rainstorm and flood disasters. Third, this study also considers the dynamic behavior of urban rainstorm resilience and the impact of different dimensions (economic, social, natural, infrastructure and information) of urban systems on flood resilience. Fourth, a system dynamic model of urban rainstorm and flood resilience is designed, and applied in one of the national central cities of China. The results can provide references for delicate decision-making of resilient city assessment and construction. The study is organized as follows: after this section outlines the research background and objectives, Section 2  describes the study area, data sources and methods, and the urban rainstorm and flood resilience model is established using system dynamic method. The results of the rainstorm flood simulation and the flood resilience investigation are given in Section 3 . Section 4  compares the main results of this study with previous studies. Section 5  provides the conclusions of the study, explores the implied policy implications, and discusses the limitations and future work of this study.  2 Material and methods 2.1 Study area Xi'an (107.4°-109.5°E, 33.4-34.5°N) is the capital city of Shaanxi province, the core city of Guanzhong Plain City Cluster, the one of the important central cities of China. It is also the largest city in the Yellow River Basin in western China and an important node city of “the Belt and Road” (Hu et al., 2020 ). Xi'an city located in the middle of the Guanzhong Plain, bordered by the Wei River in the north and the Qinling Mountains in the south. It was designated as a “World Historic City” by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1981. The topography is generally high in the southeast and low in the northwest and southwest (Fig. 1  ). The north mountain forms a natural barrier around the urban area, which also leads to a restriction of heat dispersion in the city, thus aggravating the urban heat island effect (Zhang et al., 2019 ). Xi'an city has a warm and semi-humid continental monsoon climate. In recent years, short-term heavy rainfall is frequent during the flood season (May-September), and this type of rainfall has a short predictable time limit and is very likely to cause urban flooding. Xi'an city has experienced rapid urbanization in the past 30 years, with the urbanization rate rising from 37% in 1990 to 79% in 2022. The rapid development of urbanization has caused a large number of hardened roads to replace the original natural ground that could contain water, preventing the infiltration of heavy rainfall (Ren et al., 2020 ). Urbanization produces a large amount of domestic and industrial heat. This causes instability in the urban atmosphere, resulting in “urban heat island” and “urban rain island” effects. This unstable atmospheric state increases the intensity and frequency of rainfall, which further exacerbates the risk of urban rainstorm and flood and seriously hinders cities from achieving the SDGs (Su et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ).  2.2 Data The data of this study mainly include two parts, the first part is used to conduct the simulation of urban heavy rainfall and flooding events, and the data are obtained from web pages, news and public websites. The second part is used for flood resilience analysis, mainly obtained from Xi'an City Statistical Yearbook, Shaanxi Provincial Statistical Yearbook, and Xi'an National Economic and Social Development Statistical Bulletin, which are published by the relevant local government statistical departments, some of data such as the number of bed in health institutions, the urban per capita disposable income, the mobile phone and Internet users, the number of medical insurance participants, need to handle using curve fitting (as shown in Fig. 2  ), and the goodness of fit exceeds 85%. The time span of the data is 12 years from 2009 to 2020.  2.3 System dynamics 2.3.1 System dynamics model establishment Urban flood resilience is a complex system with multiple feedback loops and nonlinear relationships. System dynamics methods have unparalleled advantages in investigating complex, nonlinear systems, but few studies have been conducted on urban flood resilience using system dynamics methods. In this study, system dynamics is applied to simulate urban flood resilience. SDMs are simulation techniques based on systems thinking to understand/solve specific problems (Stave, 2003 ). These models describe complex systems based on complexity, interconnectedness, and dynamic behavior over time (Datola et al., 2022 ). The output of the models may be inaccurate because the inferences drawn from them may be misleading due to system uncertainty (Pluchinotta et al., 2021 ). It needs to be verified and validated before practical application. SD was first proposed by Forrester J W. in 1956 and was used to describe urban systems through inventories and flows in Forrester's Urban Dynamics work in 1970. The results verified the validity of SDM in analyzing urban problems, especially in terms of system behavior (Li et al., 2020 ). The modeling steps of SDM mainly include: specifying the purpose of modeling, establishing the structure of the complex system and creating dynamic assumptions, constructing the base structure of the model as a set of stocks (accumulating flows), flows (regulating stock levels), parameters and feedback loops (connects dependent variables), validating the model performing sensitivity analysis and policy analysis on the simulation results (Gravelsins et al., 2018 ; Bala et al., 2017 ). Urban rainstorm and flood resilience is a dynamic change process, which needs to consider the influence of many elements comprehensively. Therefore, the system variables can be regarded as both the input and output of the complex system. The SDM is constructed based on the interrelationships among different system variables, and the flow chart of SDM is summarized in Fig. 3  . SDM can be divided into qualitative modeling and quantitative modeling. Qualitative modeling facilitates the understanding of conceptual systems (Pejić-Bach & Čerić, 2007 ). Quantitative modeling builds on the qualitative model by establishing mathematical relationships between variables to model the system behavior and resource levels over time (Abebe et al., 2021 ). There are different types of variables in the stock flow diagram, and state variables, rate variables, auxiliary variables and constants are used in this study. The mathematical meaning of the state variables is integral, and their integral equation is Eq. (1) :(1) S t o c k ( t )  = ∫ t 0   t  [ I n f l o w ( s )  − O u t f l o w ( s )   ]    d s + S t o c k ( t 0  )      where Stock (t ) is the cumulative value of the variable at moment t  and Stock (t0  ) is the initial moment value of the variable; Inflow (s ) is the inflow at moment t; Outflow (s ) is the outflow at moment t . The meaning of the rate variable is the concept of derivative, can be expressed in differential terms as Eq. (2) :(2) r a t e ( t ) = d ( S t o c k  )    /  d t   = I n f l o w ( t ) − O u t f l o w ( t )     where rate (t ) is the rate of change of the cumulative value at time t .  2.3.2 Multi-subject modeling and simulation theory This study simulates flood resilience, information transmission, emergency drainage and emergency dispatching behavior during urban storms, taking into account the capacity of urban systems and different actors to resist urban flooding. For the urban system aspect, this study developed SDM based on the definition of urban system, which consist of four subsystems: governance networks, socio-economic dynamics, urban infrastructure and form, networked material and energy flows (Meerow et al., 2016 ; Wu & Ning, 2018 ; Datola et al., 2022 ). Therefore, flood resilience is consist of economic resilience, social resilience, natural resilience, infrastructure resilience and information resilience. The subject term search string was defined as (“urban flood resilience evaluation” and “urban flood resilience assessment”) in the Web of Science core database, and the search period was 2008-2020. The variables affecting urban resilience to flooding were extracted from previous literature (Zhu et al., 2019 ), word frequency statistics were conducted for each evaluation variable, and the selected variables were organized corresponding to the economic, social, natural, infrastructure and information dimensions. Taking the urban population and economy as an example. In urban flooding, the people and properties that suffer from the disaster are the disaster bearers. The high population density and concentration of property within a city can directly affect the people, economy, and municipal entities within the city when a disaster strikes. Therefore, the vulnerability of disaster-bearing bodies in a region can be reflected qualitatively by economic conditions and population density (Huang et al., 2019 ). Once the disasters occur in densely populated and economically developed regions, they cause more severe damage. The relationships between five types of sub-resilience are expressed as Eq (3) :(3) F l o o d    r e s i l i e n c e = ∫ 0 t  ( E c o n o m i c    r e s i l i e n c e    + s o c i a l    r e s i l i e n c e       + n a t u r a l    r e s i l i e n c e      +   inf r a s t r u c t i o n       r e s i l i e n c e   + inf o r m a t i o n       r e s i l i e n c e     )       d t      For the urban rainstorm part, the flood resilience determined by urban construction can be no longer changed, and the deterioration of urban flooding can also be curbed by the human subjective initiative to propose emergency measures. If the emergency drainage is not timely at this time, the urban rainstorm is extremely likely to cause urban flooding, which will bring losses to the residents and lead to public panic. As the most authoritative department, the government's level of emergency response is very important. Anti-information command department, emergency office and other units as a direct participation unit, to perform its functions. If not handled properly, it is easy to cause the public to rush and loot relief supplies and other behaviors. Information dissemination throughout the process of the disaster, if the media let the public understand the disaster early, the public will be prepared for the disaster, which can effectively alleviate panic and reduce the rate of loss. According to the emergency process of urban flood emergencies and combined with flood emergency practices (Chen et al., 2012 ), this study establishes an urban rainstorm and flood resilience model based on a multi-subject modeling and simulation theoretical framework. The stock-and-flow diagram of the SD model for urban rainstorm and flood resilience is shown in Fig. 4  . Mathematical expressions for all variables of SDM as well as codes are provided in Appendix A and Appendix B. This study develops the stock-and-flow model of urban rainstorm and flood resilience, and four kinds of variables are used to describe dynamic features of the complex system. The urban rainstorm and flood resilience model includes four subsystems: flood resilience, information transfer, emergency drainage and emergency dispatch. The information transmission, emergency drainage and emergency dispatching subsystems are used for urban storm simulation. The flood resilience subsystem is used to study the flood resilience of urban systems. The stock-and-flow diagram demonstrates the interaction mechanism of each subsystem in urban rainstorm and flood resilience, and the dynamic structure and behavior of urban rainstorm and flood resilience are deeply analyzed. It is necessary to point out that the stock-and-flow model indicates the dynamic process of urban rainstorm and flood resilience.    3 Results 3.1 Urban rainstorm simulation 3.1.1 Case description On July 10, 2020, from 14:30 to 16:30, main area of Xi'an city experienced sudden and heavy rainfall with a maximum hourly rainfall of 41mm, causing serious waterlogging in many municipal roads and low-lying areas with a depth of 60-100 cm. The urban flood control department deployed 635 flood control vehicles and 875 flood control personnel according to the level III flood control plan. The simulation time of the empirical study started at 14:00 on July 10, 2020 and ended at 20:00 on July 10, 2020, with a total of 6h and a time step of 1h. Increasing the residents engagement can effectively reduce the damage. Before the arrival of short-duration heavy rainfall, residents prepare in advance to avoid casualties and property damage. The higher the government attention means the higher the government's ability to dispatch emergency supplies and flood control personnel. The higher the degree of information construction, the faster the emergency dispatching. In this study, the initial values of these three variables were set to 0.5.  3.1.2 Model verification for urban rainstorm The amount of rainfall, water depth, the number of flood control personnel, the number of emergency supplies are needed for the actual case. The model is simulated for the time from 14:00 to 20:00 on July 10, 2020. The actual cases of rainfall, water depth, the number of flood control personnel, the number of emergency supplies were compared with the simulation results, as shown in Fig. 5  . Fig. 5 a shows the simulation results of rainfall intensity of the process of heavy rainfall and flooding in Xi'an city on July 10, 2020. From Fig. 5 a, the time of this urban rainstorm starts at 14:00, the rainfall intensity increases rapidly to 28mm/h from 14:00 to 15:00, and continues to increase to 41mm/h from 15:00 to 16:00. At this time, the rainfall intensity reaches the maximum value of urban rainstorm. Rainfall intensity rapidly decreases from 16:00 to 17:00, slight fluctuations from 17:00 to 20:00, and finally gradually decreases to 0. It shows that urban rainstorm flooding disaster is usually caused by short-time heavy rainfall, and this kind of heavy rainfall has characteristics of sudden and uncertainty. Fig. 5 b shows the simulation results of the water depth of this event. From Fig. 5 b, the water depth starts to increase one hour after the rainfall starts and reaches the maximum depth of 72.24 cm at 17:00. After 17:00, the water depth gradually decreases due to the decreasing intensity of rainfall and the timely emergency response. Fig. 5 c and Fig. 5 d show the emergency simulation results of flood control personnel and emergency supplies in this rainstorm event, respectively. The emergency supplies have been used in 635 batches and 820 emergency personnel have been deployed. Before the rainstorm, the meteorological department of Xi'an city issued rainstorm warning information, so the flood control emergency personnel have been prepared for flood control in advance. Once the heavy rain triggered waterlogging, the flood control personnel carried out an emergency rescue in time. Xi'an city has placed spare flood control supplies at flood-prone spots or subway entrances, so that emergency supplies can be dispatched on a point-to-point basis when water accumulation occurs. This indicates that Xi'an city has a high familiarity with metropolitan flood counteraction and crisis reaction. As shown above, the simulation results are consistent with the actual situation and the simulation results can be proved credible.  3.1.3 Rainstorm dynamic simulation The model simulates the behavior of the system and the variables over time based on the mathematical relationships between the variables. To study the dynamic behavior between different variables during the occurrence of urban rainstorm and flood disasters, this study simulates different variables under this rainstorm and flooding disaster based on the framework of multi-subject modeling and simulation theory, as shown in Fig. 6  . Fig. 6 a∼c show the effects of this emergency relief operation. As the warning signal issued, emergency supplies began to be deployed. From 14:00 to 15:00, the intensity of rainfall increased, and flood control personnel began to act urgently. From 16:00 to 17:00, heavy rainfall caused the depth of water to gradually rise, at this time the emergency drainage speed began to accelerate rapidly. At 17:00, the water profundity arrived at the pinnacle, and the emergency drainage speed also reached the peak. After 17:00, the rainfall stopped gradually, and the emergency drainage speed decreased as the water depth decreased. It can be seen that the flood control personnel are well prepared in advance and the event of a timely emergency rescue. Fig. 6 d and Fig. 6 e show the temporal pattern of news media response to urban rainstorm and flooding. The official news issued warning information before the onset of the rainstorm, and then the number of online news increased rapidly with the intensity of rainfall and the severity of the urban rainstorm and flooding event. After 16:00, the number of online news slowly increased and finally stabilized as the intensity of rainfall decreased sharply. Finally, the cumulative number of official news releases for this flooding event was 19, and the cumulative number of online news was 134. Fig. 6 f∼i show the situation of residents' information acquisition. The weather department and the flood control department of Xi'an city issued the rainstorm warning information, and some residents received the warning information and took some avoidance measures beforehand. The rainstorm started from 14:00 to 15:00, and the residents who received the warning information in advance could prepare preventive measures. The number of news spread increased rapidly and the historical news gradually failed from 15:00 to 16:00, and the residents who received the latest information at this time could avoid the dangerous places promptly based on their knowledge and flood control information. After 16:00, the rainstorm stopped gradually, the news dissemination showed a fluctuating trend, and the amount of information obtained by residents tended to be stable. Overall, the emergency dispatch of this event was timely and effective, and the residents had high engagement.  3.1.4 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is effective in exploring the behavioral boundaries of the model and test the vigor of model-derived suggestions. Sensitivity analysis usually refers to vary the values of one or more uncertain factors, calculate their impact on the results, and estimate the sensitivity of the results to those factors. Sensitivity analysis allows the interaction between variables as well as subsystems to be examined. Sensitivity results are divided into three levels, i.e., high sensitivity (the absolute value is more than 20% at least one side), medium sensitivity (the absolute values are both between 10% and 20%), and low sensitivity (the absolute values are both below 10%) (Bao et al., 2022 ). Resident engagement is mainly influenced by the construction of information. But the degree of information enthusiasm is random and difficult to control. Drainage volume, government emergency supplies scheduling capacity and government personals scheduling capacity are influenced by the degree of government attention and the level of information technology. The severity of urban flooding is influenced by flood resistance. Therefore, this study focuses on the sensitivity of resident engagement, government attention degree, information technology construction level and flood resilience to the damage loss. Based on the control variable method, the sensitivity analysis of the urban rainstorm and flood resilience model was conducted by increasing resident engagement, government attention degree, information technology construction level and flood resilience from 0.5 to 0.9, respectively. The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Fig. 7  . From Fig. 7 , it is evident that the increasing the resident engagement, government attention degree, information technology construction and flood resilience, respectively, reduced the cumulative amount of disaster losses by 10.8%, 9.48%, 3.37% and 44.44%, respectively. In the face of flooding pressure, the stronger the city's ability to withstand flooding, the less damage it will suffer. The government needs to increase its responsibility for flood prevention and raise risk awareness, and its emergency response capabilities have an important impact on disaster response. The general public also needs to advance their knowledge of flood control and improve resident engagement. At the same time, information technology should be strengthened to ensure the accurate and timely delivery of information. Among them, flood resilience is a high sensitivity variable, resident engagement is a medium-sensitivity variable, and government attention degree and information technology construction are low-sensitivity variables. Flood resilience has the greatest degree of influence on the cumulative disaster losses from urban rainstorm and flooding, followed by the degree of resident engagement and government attention degree, which are slightly different from each other, and the degree of influence of information technology construction is smaller. The high sensitivity of flood resilience indicates that SDM has good stability and robustness. Among them, the high sensitivity variable can be used as an important node for model simulation. The sensitivity analysis shows that the sensitivity of flood resilience is much higher than other variables. Flood resilience is an intricate framework influenced by multiple dimensions. Hence, flood resilience is analyzed in depth as an important node of SDM.   3.2 Flood resistance simulation 3.2.1 Model verification for flood resistance This study adopted the model validation method of the historical test to verify the reasonableness of the simulation results (Lu et al., 2019 ; Arasteh & Farjami, 2021 ; Dai et al., 2022 ). The history test of the model is a comparison between the simulated values and real values. If the error between two values is less than 10%, it indicates a high degree of truthfulness and reliability of the model (Wang et al., 2022 ). The model was validated using historical data from 2009 to 2020, which was divided into two time periods. The first period is 2009-2015, which is used to simulation accuracy verification. The second period is 2016-2020, for prediction validation of the model using 2009-2015 as the base year. The comparison between the results of the model runs and the actual values are shown in Table 1  . The test results showed that 3/4 of the variables had a relative error less than 7% and nearly 1/2 of the variables had a relative error less than 3%, with a mean value about 4% for all variables. In the historical period from 2009 to 2015, only the rise in the number of medical insurance participants in 2010 deviates from the prediction by 13.89%. This is because that Xi'an city further improved the basic medical insurance system for urban workers in 2010, which indicates that the initiative had a positive impact on encouraging urban residents to enroll in insurance. In the prediction validation for 2016-2020, the rise in the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) deviates somewhat from the prediction only in 2020, with an error of -18.38%. Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly in the country and abroad, severely affecting the socioeconomic activities and future development, some cities unable to maintain normal levels of economic activity (Cheng et al., 2022 ). Mainly affected by the epidemic, the rate of GDP growth of Xi'an in 2020 is slower with respect to previous years. Consequently, the simulation model for flood resilience constructed in this study can genuinely and precisely reflect the quantitative connections of the actual system.  3.2.2 Scenario simulation Using 2009-2020 as the base years, the flood resilience of Xi'an city is predicted for 2021-2035. Based on the analysis of the construction criteria for resilient cities, the current situation of urban flood disasters and management and historical flood resilience, and considering the study of future development of social, economic, natural, infrastructure, and information in the urban process, this study proposes six development scenarios for the period of 2021-2035.(i) The status quo continuation development scenario. It is assumed that the social, economic, natural, infrastructure and information development follows the existing pattern, and the corresponding system variables are continued using data for the period of 2009-2015 as the baseline.  (ii) The economic priority development scenario. Assuming that urban development is aimed at pursuing economic growth, the variables of GDP growth rate and urban per capita consumption expenditure in the economic resilience subsystem are set to larger values of growth rates (excluding extreme values) in the test period.  (iii) The social priority development scenario. Assuming that urban development is aimed at social progress, the number of educated people in social resilience subsystem is set to the larger of the growth rates in the test period.  (iv) The natural priority development scenario. Assuming that urban development is aimed at ecological and environmental protection, the urban green area in natural resilience subsystem is set to the larger value of the growth rate in the test period.  (v) The infrastructure priority type development scenario. Assuming that urban development is aimed at improving infrastructure development, the variables of length of urban drainage pipe, urban road area and urban public transport in infrastructure resilience subsystem are set to the larger values of the growth rate in the test period.  (vi) The coordinated development scenario. It is assumed that urban development is oriented to the coupling and coordination of variables affecting flood resilience in various aspects. The GDP of Xi'an city is estimated to reach 1.4 trillion yuan in 2025 and the average GDP growth rate at 8.34% according to the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of Xi'an City and the Outline of Visionary Targets for 2035, the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of Shaanxi Province and the Outline of Visionary Targets for 2035 and the historical development pattern, as shown in Table 2  .     3.2.3 Flood resilience prediction The values of variables in different scenarios are substituted into the model and run to simulate the dynamic behavior of the urban system for various dimensions and different scenarios. The results are shown in Fig. 8  . In the status quo continuation development scenario, the GDP of Xi'an city will reach 146.8870 billion Chinese yuan (CNY) in 2025, and arrive at the target GDP of 1.4 trillion yuan in 2025. The urban per capita disposable income grows steadily but at a slow pace. Infrastructure construction and medical assistance capacity both continue to grow solidly. In the economic priority development scenario, the GDP will reach 2 086.53 billion yuan in 2025, far exceeding the target value of GDP in 2025. The urban per capita disposable income is significantly higher contrasted with the status quo continuation development scenario. Medical and health care is well-funded, and medical assistance capacity is significantly incremental and will keep on filling from now on. In the natural priority development scenario, there is a significant increase in urban green space compared to other development scenarios, and the urban green space area will reach 214.191 million square meter in 2035. In the social priority development scenario, the public's ability to cope with heavy rainfall and flooding increases significantly with respect to other development scenarios, and the educated population will reach 477.785 million in 2035. In the infrastructure priority development scenario, urban infrastructure is the focus of urban development compared with other development scenarios. Urban roads, transportation and drainage pipes are well-planned and developed rapidly. The length of urban drainage pipes will reach 23 958.6 km in 2035. In the coordinated development scenario, all aspects are developed in a more balanced way. The simulation shows that Xi'an city can arrive at the goal of a GDP of 1.4 trillion CNY, the urban road area will reach 49 079 000 square meter, and the number of urban public transport will reach 22 498 in 2025 under the coordinated development scenario. The quantitative analysis above is used to explore the interaction mechanism of different dimensional variables within flood resilience, we keep on investigating the dynamic changes of flood resilience, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 9  , which shows that the predicted flood resilience for six scenarios, and flood resilience is a process of improvement regardless of that scenario setting. However, the degree of improvement in flood resilience varies for different development scenarios. By 2035, the highest flood resilience is for the coordinated development scenario, followed by the natural priority development scenario, the economic priority development scenario, the infrastructure priority development scenario, the social priority development scenario, and finally the status quo continuation development scenario. The development of flood resilience is partitioned into three phases. In the beginning phase of 2021-2025, the city needs a lot of investment to maintain urban construction and form the initial flood resilience with the development of the city. Flood resilience improves slowly under this phase, and flood resilience is higher in the economic priority development scenario, with an urban flood resilience of 0.624, an improvement of 9.09%. In the preparation stage of 2026-2029, as urbanization accelerates, it needs more and more infrastructure, capital, and buildings to maintain the normal operation of the city. With the city development, the original stable structure will be destroyed and a more intricate urban network will be shaped. Human activities interfere with the state of the atmosphere, and the city begins to face more extreme weather impacts. At this point, cities need to coordinate their governance to develop the economy, natural environment and society together. While keeping a persistent economic investment in urban turn of events, a certain amount of urban green space coverage must be guaranteed, as well as a certain amount of infrastructure to check the adverse consequences of urban turn of events. Flood resilience is higher in this phase of the coordinated development scenario, with an urban flood resilience of 0.765, an improvement of 19.03%. In the development phase of 2030-2035, flood resilience is higher in the coordinated development scenario, with an urban flood resilience of 0.991, an improvement of 24.27%. In this stage, cities have been improved and governed more, and the synergistic development of economy and nature plays a key role in urban flood resilience. Urban flood resilience gains new drivers and maintains this trend in the future.    4 Discussion Nowadays, cities are subject to several external shocks (such as global warming) and internal shocks (such as urbanization construction and human activities) that lead to the challenge of torrential flooding. With the concept of resilience, previous studies have made a lot of exploration in urban resilience, but research on the urban flooding with resilience is still in the initial stage, lacking the evolutionary analysis of urban flood resilience, the coupling and coordination relationship within urban flood resilience is not well understood, and there is a lack of targeted enhancement ideas and strategies. This study integrates the complexity, dynamics, and urban multidimensionality of urban flood resilience to provide additional insights for planners to improve urban flood resilience (Chelleri & Baravikova, 2021 ; Sharifi & Yamagata, 2018 ). In terms of research objectives, SDG9, SDG11, SDG13 and related sub-objectives are referred to establish the research objectives of urban rainstorm and flood resilience to provide a replicable and universal research base for similar urban clusters and expand the global vision of achieving SDGs. In terms of the research framework, this study draws on the multidimensional urban resilience assessment framework proposed by Zhao et al. (2022)  and Hudec et al. (2018) , to integrate urban resilience with flood hazards (Yang et al., 2018 ). In summary, this study introduces the dynamic process of different actors' resistance to flooding under heavy rainfall scenario and the influence of different dimensional urban situations on urban flood resilience over time into the research framework. Ordinary linear modelling methods are not suitable at describing a complex system's dynamic behaviors and structures. SD is a modeling method of systems engineering that aims to reveal the interaction mechanisms of the system through mathematical relationships. Therefore, this study adopts the SD method to design an urban rainstorm and flood resilience model. In terms of research content, most of existing studies are simulations of single elements (Moura Rezende et al., 2019 ; Lei et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). However, urban flood resilience is a comprehensive issue need to be resolved. Therefore, this study shows the innovation and comprehensiveness of the method based on multi-subject and multi-dimensional simulation of the dynamic process of urban rainstorm and flood resilience, which can provide reference for urban rainstorm and flood prevention in others cities. The results of urban rainstorm simulation show that subsystems do not exist independently and competing relationships among subsystems have an implication on urban resilience to flooding. From the results of the rainstorm dynamic simulation, this study confirms that social media can provide valuable and timely information, which is consistent with the results of Wang et al. (2020) . However, this study puts more emphasis on the relationships between the media and three parties: the storm, the government, and the residents. The news popularity rises under the dual effect of disaster warning information and event development. When the news popularity is low, the media can focus their information releases on the avoidance and self-help measures and the popularization of disaster information, to increase the residents' attention by emphasizing the danger of the disaster. When the news popularity is too high, the public is aware of the disaster information, the information release can focus on the flood relief work to calm the public's panic. Therefore, the media needs to guide the residents' attention to the event to better help the local government in emergency management to a certain extent. From the results of the sensitivity analysis, improving urban resilience is a pathway to reduce vulnerability and to improve security for city under rapid urbanization. Notwithstanding rainstorm disaster pressure, a city's current ability to withstand flooding is reflected in the region's ability to respond to flooding and adapt to it promptly. Cities need to have enough flood resilience to withstand losses, and various subjects also need to exert their subjective initiative to curb the deterioration of urban rainstorm and flooding. The government is responsible for unified leadership, command and management in flood response efforts. Flood control personnel should remove the water from the road in time. Nonetheless, we can not only rely on the government and flood control commanders, the general public also need to learn flood control knowledge in advance, emergency management work needs to be done to “move the gate forward”. China's urban flooding disaster emergency response to participants in the main diversified degree is not high till now, and public awareness of disaster preparedness is feeble. Simultaneously, We additionally need to strengthen the construction of information technology to achieve the interconnection of monitoring and early warning systems and information sharing to ensure accurate and timely delivery of information. The high sensitivity variable is used as a node for in-depth analysis of SDM. Model validity testing is not only the key to the model testing, but also to the model construction. An accurate simulation model is required to correctly derive the behavior of the system. The system dynamics model validation approaches used in most studies include structural validation, which uses available knowledge to check whether the structure conforms to the laws of nature, extreme validation, where extreme conditions are entered into the model to compare with expected results, and historical validation, which compares the simulated and actual values (Peterson & Eberlein, 1994 ; Arasteh & Farjami, 2021 ). The absence of model validation as a component in another part of the studies indicates that the system dynamics models developed in these studies are conceptual models that do not work, lack validation information, or neglect the model validation. In this study, the reliability of the simulation results for 2009-2015 and the prediction results for 2016-2020 were verified using the historical test methods. The flood resilience simulation shows that the coordinated development scenario has the most significant improvement in flood resilience, followed by natural, economic and infrastructure, while the social priority development scenario has the least improvement in flood resilience. This is not consistent with the findings of Zhao et al. (2022) . In the coordinated development scenario, all aspects of the urban system are developed in concert so that the flood resilience of the city is fully enhanced. Balanced development is a strong guarantee for the steady improvement of the city's resilience. The natural priority development scenario and the economic priority development scenario are correlative and one can't be accomplished without the other. For the infrastructure priority development scenario, infrastructure has unique characteristics, where individual infrastructure cannot function properly and can only work if it forms a network. When infrastructure such as drainage networks are properly constructed, the ability to drain urban stormwater is increased. For social priority development scenarios, highly educated people have a more advanced ability to understand information and respond quickly. Urban construction requires continuous improvement in education, although this may be a long process that takes several generations. Based on the characteristics of flood resilience development in different scenarios, the development of flood resilience is divided into three phases beginning phase (2021-2025), the preparation phase (2026-2029), and the development phase (2030-2035). The beginning phase focuses on capital investment and construction, while the preparation phase focuses on coordinated development, which also requires significant financial support. The development phase continues to focus on coordinated development, followed by ensuring the synergistic development of nature and economy. In formulating the development strategy of urban resilience against flooding, it is necessary to tailor it to the local conditions according to the locality and development stage of the city. In response to the reality and conditions of different regions, we plan urban construction scientifically, adhere to the harmony between human and nature, and promote the healthy development of cities.  5 Conclusions Taking Xi'an city as an example, this study takes into account the dynamic characteristics of urban flood resilience and the multidimensional nature of the city, and uses the SD method to establish a system dynamic model of urban rainstorm and flood resilience, and demonstrates the internal interaction mechanism of urban flood resilience. In the urban storm simulation, this study explores the dynamic behavior of multiple subjects, including government, flood control department, real-time rainfall, residents and media based on the theory of MAS simulation framework. In the urban system, this study analyzes the characteristics of flood resilience under different time scales from five dimensions: urban economic, social, natural, infrastructure and information. The main findings are as follows:(i) Xi'an city has a strong awareness of flood control emergency in the face of urban torrential rainfall and flooding. For this urban rainstorm and flood event, the government has a strong sense of responsibility for flood control, the flood control department can make timely and effective emergency dispatch, and the general public has a high degree of participation. Ideally, the flooding should be controlled before it begins or not long before it begins, so that when the rainstorm comes again, it does not expand. However, this requires having accurate early warning prediction of rainfall and accurate judgment of flood-prone spots, which is still difficult for flood control personnel.  (ii) In the urban rainstorm and flood resilience model, flood resilience is a high sensitivity variable. It is trailed by resident engagement and government attention degree, which are slightly different from each other, and information technology construction is a low sensitivity variable. It indicates that the construction and planning of urban systems are more resistant to flooding in the face of urban heavy rainfall, followed by the residents' flood awareness and self-help measures for flood prevention and timely and scientific emergency response by the government. Integrating flood control knowledge into the public's regular routine and establishing a sense of responsibility for multiple subjects permits a wide range of social subjects to actively respond to urban rainstorm and flood disasters. Finally, the information technology construction can speed up the emergency rescue, and can be “icing on the cake”, but “charcoal in the snow” can only rely on their own.  (iii) The development of urban flood resilience can be partitioned into a beginning phase, a preparation phase and a development phase. Based on the development process, the dynamic improvement mechanism of urban flood resilience is proposed: Firstly, urban flood resilience is a comprehensive concept to consider multiple dimensions, and the model to keep urban flood resilience growing all the time is collaborative development. If funds can be continuously invested to build infrastructure and ensure a good natural environment for the city, urban flood resilience will eventually achieve sustained growth. Secondly, different dimensions that dominate urban flood resilience vary for different periods. For example, the economy dominates in the first period, while collaborative development becomes the key driver in the latter period. Third, each subsystem under the complex system of urban rainstorm and flood resilience has its sensitivity variables, and policies targeting the sensitivity variables can have the greatest effect. Improving urban flood resilience is a long and complex process, and managers need to form time-series policies and adjust their improvement strategies in time. From the outset, managers may find that their efforts are not rewarded. In this case, managers should continue to invest resources and build resilience and wait for cities to enter a period of growth in flood resilience.    Several limitations should be addressed to better understand the results in our future work. The shortage of data is not conducive to model validation due to data availability limitations. Our future work will focus on more comprehensive system dynamics models based on more data and variables, and finding more reasonable validation methods to compensate for model validation deficiencies. Moreover, a multidimensional and multi-cycle integrated analysis of urban rainstorm and flood resilience is supposed to dissect the interactions among subsystems in more detail, and also, more urban rainstorm and flooding events case study should be more better to verify the model. Based on the results of the study, the strengths and weaknesses of the system dynamics model in the field of urban flood resilience are explored. First, system dynamics is a constitutive analysis method that emphasizes the structure and behavioral mechanisms of the system, and is therefore more applicable to complex systems. Urban flood resilience is a type of complex system that contains multiple interconnected subsystems. Therefore, system dynamics is very suitable for the study of urban flood resilience. Second, system dynamics can simulate the model quantitatively and dynamically, through which the best way to improve urban flood resilience can be explored and provide a scientific basis for the optimization of urban planning schemes. However, the process of establishing the system dynamics model is more complicated, so it is difficult to update and modify the model. As a result, there are few follow-up studies on the models, leading to the use of a model mostly for one-time use. In the future, the continuous improvement of the connotation of models with good application effect or the establishment of a base model library may become the direction of future development of system dynamics models.
