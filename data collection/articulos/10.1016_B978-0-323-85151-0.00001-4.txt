               Smart cities and the SDGs are two potent policy-making paradigms that shape the thrust of academic and popular debates today. The SDGs represent a major multilateral effort to shift the stakeholders’ attention toward more sustainable and resilient pathways to growth and development. As regards the SDG 11, and the imperative of making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, the big question is to what extent local authorities, frequently for lack of powers, resources, and know-how, may effectively implement the four-pronged goal of inclusion, safety, resilience, and sustainability. This chapter sheds light on this issue and, thus, discusses also the content of the volume.

The SDGs represent a major multilateral effort to shift the stakeholders’ attention toward more sustainable and resilient pathways to growth and development. As regards the SDG 11, and the imperative of making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, the big question is to what extent local authorities, frequently for lack of powers, resources, and know-how, may effectively implement the four-pronged goal of inclusion, safety, resilience, and sustainability. This chapter sheds light on this issue and, thus, discusses also the content of the volume.   Keywords Smart cities  SDGs  SDG 11  Policy-making  Inclusion  Safety  Resilience  Sustainability   1 Introduction This edited volume looks at smart cities and the smart city debate through the lens of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the broader discussion on sustainability as it unfolds in research and popular discourse worldwide. By engaging in this discussion, the authors contributing to this volume explore how the encounter of sophisticated technology and progressing urbanization may yield positive results in city/urban space. The measure of success is defined by the, entailed in the SDG 11 four-pronged goal of inclusion, safety, resilience, and sustainability. The SDGs have defined the frames of the policy-making process and business strategy development around the world. Smart cities represent in this context a specific case and this book explores it in depth. A wealth of literature on smart cities exist (Anthopoulos, 2019 ; Cardullo et al., 2019 ; Min et al., 2020 ; Vacca, 2020 ; Visvizi & Lytras, 2019a ; Yamagata & Yang, 2020 ). Each of these contributions, adopting a specific disciplinary perspective and promoting a specific worldview, adds a piece of knowledge and understanding of the smart city and its role in the ceaseless reconstitution of our societies (van Soest et al., 2019; Wu, Chen, Wu, & Lytras, 2018 ). This volume seeks to add to this debate. The impact of information and communication technology (ICT) on our societies is pervasive. More frequently than not, ICT and ICT-enhanced services and solutions are applied in the public and private domains even before the average citizen recognizes their existence. A dense web of distributed and interconnected ICT-enhanced services and applications emerges and ties the fabric of the city in a manner unknown before. A new virtual dimension is added to the city space enabling day-to-day public services delivery, business activity, as well as representation and participation in issues pertinent to the city (Marvin, Luque-Ayala, & McFarlane, 2015; OECD, 2020b; Visvizi & Lytras, 2019b ). Simultaneously, the definition of the open, tangible public space, traditionally defining the city alters as we speak. Substantial challenges and opportunities emerge for the field of urban design. As the inroads of ICT-enhanced applications and services continue, it is necessary to address the persistent duality of smart city and sustainable city. This book seeks to do just that. The collection of papers included in this volume makes a case that a city can only be truly smart if the promise and the potential that the ICT brings are employed to promote inclusion, safety, resilience, and sustainability. Several dimensions of these concepts exist (Clarinval et al., 2020 ; Gámez-García et al., 2019 ; Kitchin et al., 2019 ; Moreno-Ibarra & Torres-Ruiz, 2019 ; Shmelev, 2019 ; Zait, 2017 ) and each of these should be taken into consideration when examining specific aspects of the smart city and its development and functioning. The objective of this chapter is to shed light on the concepts of the smart city and the SDGs to offer a guided insight into the book’s rationale and content. Conclusions follow.  2 Connecting the smart city and the SDGs Smart cities and SDGs are two potent policy-making paradigms that shape the thrust of academic and popular debates. Launched in 2015, the SDGs were thought to build on the heritage of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). While the MDGs had been discussed in terms of a reasonable success story (Assefa et al., 2017 ; Fukuda-Parr et al., 2013 ; Ruhil, 2015 ), the implementation of the SDGs seems to be sluggish, thus giving ground to voices of criticism (Gusmão Caiado et al., 2018 ; Ramirez-Rubio et al., 2019 ). The SDGs represent a major multilateral effort to shift the stakeholders’ attention toward more sustainable and resilient pathways of growth and development. Considerable body of literature exists in which the intricacies of the SDGs are discussed (Bali Swain & Yang-Wallentin, 2020 ; Christ & Burritt, 2019 ; Moyer & Hedden, 2020 ; Vandemoortele, 2018 ). The important, and yet frequently unrecognized, feature of the SDGs is that the very definition of respective goals forming the SDG agenda, one, inserts the developed countries in the scope of the SDGs, and, two, makes it easier for diverse stakeholders to embark on the implementation of specific goals in line with their organization’s mission and vision. This, seemingly tiny, yet audit-wise important, issue allows companies to devise budget lines geared toward targeted implementation of specific SDGs. This flexibility ingrained in the SDGs partly explains why it is difficult to measure progress toward the SDGs’ implementation (cf. Ali et al., 2018 ; Leal Filho, 2020 ; Miola & Schiltz, 2019 ). In the context of the debate on the SDG 11 and cities, the key problem that this volume identifies is the following. In essence, the imperative of making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable implicitly imposes the responsibility for the goal’s attainment on the local authorities, say municipalities. It is not always, however, the case that the local authorities have the legal powers, resources, or know-how to implement respective solutions. In this regard, progress toward the four-pronged goal of inclusion, safety, resilience, and sustainability is doomed to be uneven and asynchronous, both at international and local levels. Progressing urbanization, the increasing density of population in the limited city space, however, also the condensation of talent in the geographically constrained city space, require that the question of power assigned to the city authorities is reconsidered. Certainly, for quite some time now, substantial effort was invested in this issue, mostly through policies and regulatory frameworks aimed at decentralization of power (OECD, 2019 ), promotion of local (self)governance (UNDP, 2010 ), and multilevel governance initiatives (OECD, 2017 ). Still more effort is needed on the part of national governments and city authorities to devise strategies and action plans aimed at the implementation of the SDG11 in the city space. The case of Bonn (Germany) is a welcome highlight in this respect. With the support of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the city authorities implement a strategy aimed at providing affordable housing, expanding and maintaining green spaces, shifting to clean forms of transport and energy, and providing employment opportunities for all, especially for low-skilled workers. Ways of managing trade-offs between climate, sustainable mobility, and affordable housing goals form a part of the strategy too (OECD, 2020a ). Several other examples would be possible (cf. Carroll, 2020 ; Gobin-Rahimbux et al., 2020 ). This volume stems from the recognition that the smart city, seen as the key concept in the policy-making and urban planning agendas, faces a variety of challenges. These can be identified at several levels, including infrastructure; citizens’ ability and willingness to use smart city services, including the question of accessibility; citizen participation and representation; the increasingly salient issue of data privacy; data sovereignty; and many more. These issues have been highlighted in the academic debate on smart cities (Calzada & Almirall, 2020; Lytras, Visvizi, Chopdar, Sarirete, & Alhalabi, 2021; Lytras & Visvizi, 2018 ; Mora & Deakin, 2019 ). This volume expands the insights contained therein, frequently by means of adding the empirical and comparative perspectives. In the context defined by an increasing pace of urbanization, especially in so-called Global South, by the increasing recognition and the speed of application of ICT-enhanced services and applications in the city, this volume sheds light on the promise and constraints related to the attainment of the four-pronged goal of inclusion, safety, resilience, and sustainability in the smart city. The SDGs have been promoted as a comprehensive approach to tackle the key issues and challenges that inhibit sustainable and growth and development today. Against the backdrop of criticisms voiced vis-à-vis the SDGs, this volume suggests that the SDGs be viewed as a broad and a long-term strategy. Attempts to quantify the progress in the SDGs are useful but misleading. The value of the SDGs is hidden in-between the numbers. It is best represented by the change induced in citizens’ and decision-makers’ attitudes to planning and policy-making. The smart city is but one of the domains where this change takes place. This book sheds light on it.  3 Review of the chapters’ content The book’s content is divided into four parts. Part 1 offers a detailed insight into the definitional and conceptual issues related to the implementation of the SDG 11 in the smart city. Chapters 2–4 2  3  4     offer a detailed insight into the concepts of inclusiveness, safety, resilience, and sustainability and their meaning in the city space. Conceptual and empirical issues are stressed and elaborated. Part 2 of the volume engages with the question of why smart governance is a necessity for the attainment of the SDGs. The chapters forming this part of the book, Chapters 5–9 5  6  7  8  9    , make the claim that to make the smart city truly smart it is necessary that the citizens’ voices and so their feedback are heard, and that the citizens are involved in the making of the smart city. Part 3 of the volume focuses on the interconnected issues of safety, security, exclusion/inclusion, and well-being in the smart city. Chapters 10–12 10  11  12     elaborate on diverse aspects of these issues, including smart city planning and urban design, the emergence of ghettos and ways of preempting their expansion, cybersecurity issues pertinent to the smart city and its operation. Part 4 of the volume allows some space for sociological reflection on the smart city. Chapters 13 and 14 13  14     elaborate on diverse sociological aspects pertaining to the smart city and its development. Chapter 15  adds to this thread by demonstrating the value added of foresight exercises for sustainable smart city development. Chapter 16  concludes and suggests the way forward. Details on each chapter’s content follow. Following this introductory chapter, in Chapter 2 , Raquel Pérez delHoyo, Anna Visvizi, and Higinio Mora, explore “Inclusiveness, safety, resilience, and sustainability in the smart city context,” The increasing pace of urbanization and its geospatial distribution suggest that over the years to come cities and urban ecosystems will be exposed to a plethora of new challenges. The 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development promotes the objective of cities being inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Yet, the crucial in this context, Goal 11, moves the responsibility for addressing issues and challenges related to the implementation of the SDGs to the gesture and responsibility of local governments. The problem is that not always local authorities are endowed with the necessary powers and resources to effectively implement respective policy goals and objectives. This only adds to the challenges cities faces today. This chapter queries the meaning of the key concepts defining the SDG 11 and suggests how ICT-enhanced applications and services may be useful in meeting the SDG 11. In Chapter 3 , titled “Sustainability and smart cities: What is in there? Bridging the theory and practice,” Marco Tregua, Anna D’Auria, and Francesco Bifulco employ bibliometric analysis to examine how smart interventions are prioritized by city managers and combined in the practical realm of sustainable cities. To accomplish this goal, the authors perform a bibliometric analysis to depict the main elements describing sustainability in the smart city, with reference to people, technology, and policy. Successively, the discussion in the chapter moves from the evidence offered in the literature to practical experiences from cities at an advanced level of development as shown in the last 2019 IESE ranking. The authors argue that the interplay of elements such as people participation, technology-supported decision-making process, and governance involving an increasing number of actors are conducive to the attainment of the SDG 11 in the cities. In Chapter 4 , titled “Technology and the SDGs in the smart city context,” Chrysaida-Aliki Papadopoulou highlights that the smart city represents a fundamental trend in urban development based on the exploitation of technology in order to support cities’ sustainable development. Economic growth, social cohesion, and environmental protection are straightforwardly linked to the “smart” dimension of cities, implying the use of technology in almost all urban functions. Such pattern of urban development stimulates the accomplishment of sustainable development goals; especially the one concerning the promotion of safe, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable cities (SDG 11). Specific targets clarify this general perspective, highlighting issues such as standards of living, transportation services, climate change adaptation, etc. Each target is accompanied by an indicator measuring its performance. This chapter focuses on the role of smart technologies in achieving SDG 11. The key fundamental axes of smart cities are explored. Thereinafter, the focus shifts on the investigation of technologies supporting/upgrading city functions while their contribution to the accomplishment of SDG 11 is examined. Chapter 5 , titled “Governance and the SDGs in the smart city context,” by Shahira Assem Abdel Razek, examines the term governance in context of the smart city. Whereas the term governance has been widely researched in a variety of fields (Visvizi, 2015 ), including the smart city context (Tomor et al., 2019 ), here the term governance is linked with urban space design and a city’s sustainability. Against this backdrop, this chapter reviews the debate on urban development and governance to identify how these two strands of the debate address the issue of sustainability. A thorough discussion on how urban design can be conducive toward the attainment of the SDGs follows. Chapter 6 , titled “Reinterpreting governance and SDGs in smart cities: An ecosystems-based view,” by Francesco Polese, Orlando Troisi, Mara Grimaldi, and Francesca Loia, explores the Italian municipality of Trento through the double lens of the smart city and smart urban ecosystem. The ecosystem-based view allows to identify different technologies, resources, and value co-creation practices that arise from actors’ engagement with the (smart) city (space). If adequately harmonized by governance, these variables prove consequential for the co-development of sustainable innovation in the smart city. The findings and key arguments presented in the chapter are based on the case-study analysis, namely the case of TrentoSmartCity. This analysis allowed the authors to identify the main drivers of sustainable innovation in the smart city and to underline the harmonizing role of governance in this process. As the authors stress, the identification of the main governance steps for the (co-)development of innovation can help scholars and practitioners to shed light on the key role of managerial and governance skills (human component) in the successful exploitation of the innovation opportunities offered from technologies. In Chapter 7 , titled “Open data portals for urban sustainable development: People, policies, and technology,” Christine Meschede and Tobias Siebenlist make a case for smart and sustainable cities as the key drives of sustainable urban development. The SDGs, as the authors argue, play a major role in this regard in that they can serve as an action plan for smart sustainable cities. With SDG 11, the importance of cities in context of sustainable development was reified. Moreover, and this makes this chapter stand out, the SDG 16 entails a target of access to information for everyone. Combining these goals, the availability of open urban data can promote a smart and sustainable development in cities. It can also supply viable data for measuring progress toward the SDGs. The authors base their discussion on the analysis of three national open data portals, including the cases of Australia, Germany, and South Africa. In Chapter 8 , titled “The potential of location-based social networks for participatory urban planning,” Pablo Martí, Raquel Pérez-delHoyo, Almudena Nolasco-Cirugeda, Leticia Serrano-Estrada, and Clara García-Mayor explore the question of citizen participation in urban decision-making processes. As the authors argue citizen participation has proven to be of great value in view of aligning the population needs with urban planning proposals. However, in many cases, citizens frequently fail to be an active part of these planning processes. The SDG 11 offers urban planners the opportunity to reflect upon current strategies and tools to achieve more participatory and inclusive processes. In order to take a step forward in this direction, this paper studies the potential of five location-based social networks—Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Strava, and MapMyRun—to inform and improve urban planning processes. Within the context of smart cities, the main objective of this work is to present the advantages of incorporating user-generated information offered by these sources into decision-making processes to encourage smarter, participatory, and inclusive urban planning and management. In Chapter 9 , titled “The green turn: Smart cities, SDGs, and sustainability in the EU parties discourse,” Cláudia Toriz Ramos examines the question of sustainability and the smart city through the lens of the SDG 11 and the green turn in European politics. The author argues that environmental issues became the leitmotiv in European politics and a major issue in recent electoral campaigns. Public awareness of the importance of the topic, notably resulting from the sustainable development goals (SDGs) agenda, reinforced this trend. However, the smart city issue cannot be tackled within a single policy area in the European Union (EU), as it requires a combination of approaches drawn from technology, energy and transport, and cohesion and regional development policies. The capacity to propose policies on sustainable cities requires from politicians a systemic approach to sustainability and, indeed, the ability to put forward ambitious plans for change. It is an assumption of this chapter that the EU can play a major role in shaping that change. It is also claimed that by engaging with this topic, the EU level parties can foster democratic processes in the EU. These are policy issues that touch the citizen’s everyday life, and thus carry the potential to bring the citizens and the parties closer together. With reference to European political parties’ discourse, especially at the time of the 2019 European Parliament elections, the chapter covers their main perspectives on environment, sustainability, and urban life. Chapter 10 , titled “Exploring the relationship between the smart-sustainable city, well-being, and urban planning: An analysis of current approaches in Europe,” by Vasiliki Geropanta, Anna Karagianni, Sofia Mavroudi, and Panagiotis Parthenios, examines the cases of Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Vienna to make a case for the benefits of incorporating urban technologies into public space, As the authors argue this approach allows to promote successful urban development strategies that are aligned with the SDG 11. Chapter 11 , titled “A smart approach to identifying intra-urban disparities in neighborhood satisfaction: An example from Poland,” by Piotr Maleszyk, offers an insight into the case of Lubin, a provincial, yet a thriving, university city, located in the eastern part of Poland. This chapter discusses the application of a smart tool for recognizing neighborhood satisfaction implemented in Lublin (Poland). The chapter also presents broader patterns in the “smart city” development in Poland, and then, specifically, in Lublin. In this way, the discussion in this chapter connects the smart city and the SDGs debates by focusing on and exploring in depth the question of intra-urban inequalities, their implications, and ways of addressing the municipality level. Chapter 12 , titled “Cybersecurity, sustainability and resilience capabilities of a smart city,” by Roberto O. Andrade, Sang Guun Yoo, Luis Tello-Oquendo, and Iván Ortiz-Garcés, queries in which ways and to what extent emerging technologies may enhance the sustainability and resilience capacity of smart cities. As the authors point out, the prevalence of ICT-based solutions in the city space, increasingly makes smart cities vulnerable also to cybersecurity threats. However, increasingly the same technologies are susceptible to cybersecurity threats. This chapter examines the connection between cybersecurity and the sustainability and resilience capabilities of smart cities. To this end, this chapter maps the most common types of cybersecurity threats and their impact on smart city domains such as transportation, health, home, and others. These are examined and assessed by considering each layer of the smart city architecture proposed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The discussion is embedded in the broader framework of the sustainable development goals (SDG11), in which the notion of cities’ resilience and sustainability is stressed. In Chapter 13 , titled “Sociological reflections on smart cities and ‘city times,’” Pablo de-Gracia-Soriano, Diana Jareño-Ruiz, María Jiménez-Delgado, and Antonio Jiménez-Delgado reflect on the ethical frameworks of smart cities. In this context the connection between the smart cities agenda and well-being of cities’ inhabitants is discussed. Emphasis is placed on the concept of “city times,” i.e., a term closely related to the lifestyles that take place in any social space, such as the city. A case is made for the conceptual suitability of “city times” for the analysis of the design of public policies in the smart city, especially in view of promoting well-being and healthy social life. Ultimately, the authors argue that that insights from sociology are of value in the process of developing smart cities and in the attainment of achievement of the SDGs. In Chapter 14 , titled “Smart city as the city of knowledge,” Robert Laurini, Giuseppe Las Casas, and Beniamino Murgante view the smart city as the city of knowledge. As the authors argue, the 21st century is the knowledge society century. Knowledge sharing is thus seen as the key tool to enhance the human condition. This suggests the importance of education and culture as key factors necessary to empower the members of the society. It also suggests that knowledge is the driver of the economy and economic growth and development. Finally, it also suggests that knowledge is the key resource necessary for efficient governance. In this context, the key question is what are the implications of efficient knowledge sharing for the process of governance in the smart city? The authors examine this question by reference to the SDGs and their implementation in the European Union. In Chapter 15 , titled “Foresight exercises and the transformation of cities into smart cities,” by Andrei Ștefan Neștian, and Ana Iolanda Voda, the value of foresight for the smart city is examined. As the authors argue, in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the definition of stakeholder community’s vision about the future shape of the city and its transformation into a smart city is one of the key stages in smart city development. City foresight is viewed as the science of thinking about the future of cities. Urban communities tend to resort to foresight exercises as they help highlight and aggregate the needs of multiple stakeholders, suggest innovative solutions, and define a time horizon needed for developing realistic initiatives for city transformation. City foresight enables the exploration of alternative development paths and, therefore, provides practical tools for policy-makers to enhance their decision-making capabilities by using different scenario design exercises and exploratory hypotheses. The objective of this chapter is to shed light on the salience of foresight exercises in the transformation of cities into smart cities. For this purpose, we have systematized the foresight exercises and have made theoretical clarifications and classifications of forecast data, activities, and techniques used in city foresight, underlining the importance of foresight exercises for smart cities and their benefits. This systematization is useful for understanding the multiple alternatives, from which one can choose in order to define a foresight exercise, prior to putting forward practical initiatives transforming the city systems and public governance policies for a smart city. By means of conclusion, in Chapter 16 , titled “Transforming the city from within: SDGs and their transformative dynamics in the smart city,” Anna Visvizi and Raquel Perez del Hoyo outline how this volume contributes to the smart cities debate and in which ways it may be useful to the broader audience.
