Keywords Water recycling  sustainable development goals  reuse application  standard limits   5.1 Introduction  The crisis of water shortage in the world has increased rapidly due to population growth and industrial development in the last two decades. According to UNs Water, the UN’s coordinating body on water issues, water scarcity will displace between 24 and 700 million people by 2030. World Water Day, celebrated every year on March 22, focuses on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, which means ensuring access to sanitation water for all by 2030 and highlighting the importance of fresh water.1–3   Water covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface, but only a fraction is fresh water, and less than that is available for people to use. The available clean water is distributed unevenly across the earth, and billions of individuals have water supply challenges, especially households in rural areas1,3   Water scarcity in arid zones has placed heavy pressure on urban areas and about 55% of the world’s population inhabitants, according to UNs.4   Another key standard addressing SDG 6 is unsanitary systems. It is estimated that 1.8 billion people worldwide use a drinking water source contaminated with fecal coliforms, which has  adverse consequences such as disease, poverty, malnutrition, and child death.5,6   Sanitary reuse and water recycling will help meet the sanitary needs of many communities worldwide. Reusing and recycling water will promote economic, social, and environmental sustainability.1,2,7    5.2 Water reuse and recycling objectives The advantages of using recycled wastewater in various urban, industrial, and agricultural applications are:• Protection of freshwater resources;  • Management of compounds harmful to the environment;  • Economic benefits by reducing the need for additional water resources and building infrastructure and; and  • Reducing the use of chemical fertilizers due to the presence of nutrients in recycled water from wastewater.    Also, water reform can be used in urban development projects where there are not enough resources and water prices are high.8,9   Various factors are involved as drivers in the implementation of urban, industrial, and agricultural wastewater recycling, the most important of which are:• Proximity: water recycling in the suburbs, where there are not enough water resources and the price of water (without subsidies) is relatively high, can be easily used.  • Dependency: Recycled water is a reliable source (especially in droughts) provided as a result of permanent wastewater generation.  • Compatibility: economic and technical researches on wastewater treatment processes with the ability to produce water for drinking and nondrinking purposes are available.  • Safety: recycling systems have been operating for four centuries in the USA and other developed countries with no evidence of public health effects.  • Competitive demand for water: a growing tension in water resources due to increased agricultural sector and population needs.  • Financial responsibility: Understanding of water management from the point of view of economic profitability.  • Public benefit: a growing recognition of the environmental effects caused by excessive consumption of water resources and the community’s desire for water recycling solutions.  • Recorded documents: successful results of numerous water recycling and reclamation projects worldwide.   • Strict water standards: price increase along with the progress of wastewater treatment equipment to achieve high-quality recycled water.  • Opportunities & necessity: drivers for developing wastewater reuse and recycling projects, including drought, water shortage and prevention of seawater intrusion and prohibition of sewage discharge, economic, political advantages, and appropriate technical situations in urban, industrial, and agricultural wastewater recycling.10       5.3 Water reuse, recycling, and sustainable development goals 5.3.1 Sustainable development definition Sustainable development, defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” was contextualized by the Brundtland Commission.11   These documents focused on three pillars of human health: socio-political, economic, and ecological/environmental circumstances. The basic concept subscribes to strong measures to rowel economic and social development while ensuring that environmental integrity is sustained for future descendants.11    5.3.2 Water and sustainable development There is adequate fresh water on the planet, but because of bad economics or poor infrastructure, millions of people, most children, die from diseases associated with insufficient water resources, sanitation, and hygiene every year.12,13   Water is at the core of sustainable development and is necessary for decreasing the global disease load and improving populations’ health, welfare, and productivity. Water is also at the heart of adaptation to climate change, serving as the crucial link between the climate system, human society, and the environment.14    5.3.3 Sustainable development goals on water (SDG6) The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) framework does not address the full water and development agenda and does not even fully recognize its synergies with other areas.15   The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes 17 goals and 169 targets, sets out an ambitious vision for sustainable development and integrates its social, economic, and environmental dimensions. SDG6 expands the MDG focus on drinking water and basic sanitation to include the more holistic management of ecosystem resources, water, and wastewater,  acknowledging the importance of an enabling environment.16,17   It is also an important step toward a sustainable water future. SDG6 is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the UN’s General Assembly in 2015 to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.” Global targets which directly or indirectly related to clean water and sanitation are listed in Table 5.1  .  5.3.4 Making a fundamental change in sustainable development through recycling Wastewater is rich in nutrients and carbon and could provide new water, fertilizer, and energy if collected and treated properly. WWTPs recover nutrients and bioenergy, producing new water sources that can be reused, but most of the wastewater is still discharged directly into natural ecosystems, polluting the environment and taking valuable nutrients and other recoverable materials with it.19     5.4 Categories of water reuse applications In this section, different categories of water reuse are listed and disgusted. Table 5.2   describes the water reuse categories.10,20–23    5.5 Treatment technologies for reuse applications Over the past 20 years, a wide range of treatment technologies has been studied, developed, and operationalized to remove compounds in filtered effluents. In this report, the challenges, solutions, and leadership strategies of new technologies and superior use used for better investigation are reviewed and described. Advanced wastewater treatment is necessary, considering the need to remove organic matter and total dissolved solids over the amounts achieved by conventional secondary wastewater treatment processes to meet more stringent discharge and reuse requirements. The need to completely remove the remaining suspended solids to have a greater effect on the desalination of treated wastewater. To limit algal blooms in sensitive water bodies, the need to treat nutrients over the amounts achieved in conventional secondary wastewater treatment processes. The need to remove specific inorganic (such as heavy metals) and organic (such as MTBE and NDMA) substances to meet more strict discharge and reuse requirements for discharge to surface waters and indirect water uses (such as groundwater recharge).24,25   The need to remove inorganic   compounds (such as heavy metals and silica) and specific organic compounds for industrial reuse (such as process water, cooling water, high-pressure boiler water, and low-pressure boiler compensation water). To reuse or recycle water and wastewater, there is a need for different technologies that will be discussed in this section. Usually, advanced wastewater treatment processes are used in the secondary and tertiary treatment stages. These processes are usually used when high-quality water is needed. The treatment processes used to treat wastewater for various urban, industrial, and agricultural purposes are such as: Sand filters : Filtration is the most common treatment process to remove solid particles before disinfection. Depth filtration is the filter used to remove suspended solids from a liquid by passing the effluent through a filter bed consisting of granulated or compacted media. Types of filter beds include sand, anthracite, and garnet stone.  Activated sludge with fixed or moving bed. Various types of synthetic media have been used in activated sludge processes. These media can be used as a suspended activated sludge mixture or fixed in the aeration tank. The terms used to depict these processes are activated sludge with a fixed bed, like integrated fixed-film activated sludge, or activated sludge with a moving bed, like Moving bed bioreactor. These processes are designed to upgrade the activated sludge process by increasing the cell mass concentration in the aeration tank to create the potential to reduce the tank’s dimensions and improve the quality of effluent [such as an aerated biological filter (BAF)]. Constructed wetlands : Constructed wetlands have been created as a low-cost natural technology for treating various types of wastewater. These wetlands are designed to emulate natural wetland ecosystems in the physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove pollutants from wastewater and are preferred as a practical alternative to more energy-consuming chemical or mechanical systems. In fact, these systems were built and designed to take advantage of the natural functions of wetland plants, soils, and microbial communities to treat pollution in surface water, groundwater, or sewage.13   Also, constructed wetlands have significantly lower maintenance and capital costs than conventional systems. Types of wetlands include surface, subsurface, and hybrid wetlands, which hybrid wetlands are a combination of surface and subsurface wetlands.26   Phytoremediation : Phytoremediation is a purification technique by plants that can remove pollutants using absorption, transformation, accumulation, or sublimation methods. Phytoremediation using the engineering of green plants, including herbaceous and woody species, removes pollutants from water and soil or reduces the risks of environmental pollutants such as heavy metals, organic compounds, rare elements, and radioactive substances.27   Although polluted plants are a major concern for experts, with new methods to produce energy with these plants, we could overcome this problem. Adsorption : Adsorption is the process of accumulating substances in a solution in a suitable medium. Adsorption is a mass transfer process in which a component in a liquid phase is transferred to a solid phase. The adsorbed substance is a substance that is removed from the liquid in the common phase. An Adsorbent is a solid, liquid, or gas substance on which absorbed substances accumulate. The most important adsorbents are activated carbon and synthetic polymers or silicate adsorbents. Activated carbon is usually used for wastewater treatment in two forms, granulated or powdered. Activated carbon is used to remove resistant organic compounds and inorganic compounds such as nitrogen, sulfides, and heavy metals. Removing taste and odor-producing compounds from wastewater is another important application, especially in reuse.  Ion exchange : Ion exchange is defined as a process in which different ions replace certain ions in an insoluble exchange material in a solution. In this method, ions with high valence are preferred over ions with low valence, and the exchange reaction rate increases with increasing ion capacity. One of the most common applications of this method in water purification is hardening, in which double-valent and higher ions such as calcium and magnesium are removed. Also, this method is used in wastewater treatment to remove nitrogen, heavy metals, and all dissolved solids. Advanced oxidation process : Advanced oxidation processes oxidize complex organic components in wastewater and turn them into simpler substances by producing hydroxyl radicals.28   In many treatment plants, this method is placed before biological treatment to break down complex and specific compounds and reduce the toxicity of wastewater, which then increases the efficiency of biological treatment.29   The most important advanced oxidation technologies are ozone+UV, ozone+H2 O2 , ozone+ultrasonic, ozone+TiO2 , UV+H2 O2  and ultrasonic waves. AOPs are usually used for wastewater with low COD because of their high cost. AOPs are also used for wastewater disinfection and treatment of persistent organic pollutants. Membrane processes : In the past, the use of membrane filtration was limited to specific applications such as industrial separation processes and desalination, but nowadays, membranes are used for wastewater treatment on a large scale. Membrane technology separates suspended and soluble solids and pathogens from water and wastewater. Membrane filtration systems are usually classified based on the size of the particles that are not accepted by the membrane or based on the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO).17   This classification is shown in Table 5.3  . The main processes for wastewater treatment are MF, UF, and RO membranes. Usually, MF and UF membranes are used as pretreatment for RO. Fig. 5.1   shows the materials and compounds removed in different membrane processes. Membrane bioreactors : A membrane bioreactor (MBR) combines an activated sludge process and membrane separation. By using MBR, the  need for sedimentation processes used in conventional activated sludge methods is eliminated. MBR is used in two types of external and internal (submerged) arrangements in wastewater treatment processes. The advantages of MBR technology include the production of less excess sludge, excellent quality of the effluent in terms of turbidity, bacteria, BOD and TSS, and independence of the quality of the effluent from the influent, removing the clarifiers, suitable for both industrial and municipal wastewaters.30   Tree of technologies required for wastewater reuse and recycling : There are different factors for choosing wastewater treatment and reuse processes for a specific purpose, which include: the quality of the water source, the pollution discharged to wastewater, the treatment processes available in the treatment plant, the existing laws for wastewater reuse, the type of water required and the amount of water needed for each purpose use. According to the mentioned variables, the wastewater treatment process differs for each type of reuse and recycles consumption.31  Fig. 5.2   presents a matrix model of treatment processes used for wastewater reuse.  5.6 Global regulations and standards in water reuse applications Regulations related to water recycling and reuse could have a crucial effect on water scarcity. They address the water shortage crisis in cities   and offer instructions on using recycled water to satisfy water demands and relieve the pressure on metropolitan areas. Standards are crucial to reuse water efficiently and help countries fight water shortage.32,33   The standards and regulations for the quality of water and wastewater reuse of some industrial applications in Iran, the USA, and China are presented in Table 5.4  . Some regulations and standards for the safe reuse of water in rural application are presented in Table 5.5  . There are different guidelines and standards throughout the countries of the world. Table 5.6   represents the guidelines according to the United States of America’s Environmental Protecting Agency (USA EPA), European Union, and World Health Organization (WHO) for wastewater and water reuse for agricultural purposes.11    5.7 Global experiences in water reuse Water reuse has grown rapidly worldwide, especially in European countries, America, China, and Australia. Israel is the largest consumer     of treated wastewater for irrigation of agricultural lands, so 90% of its reclaimed water is used.39   In this section, some of the hundreds of water reuse projects that have been implemented or are being implemented in different countries, along with their announced achievements, are presented, which is good evidence for taking the issue of water reuse more seriously. Spain : There is a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Tossa de Mar with the purpose of Nonpotable (urban reuse), a reuse project in 2003 has been started €837,000 for the water reclamation plant and recycled water distribution network. The main driver for this project was the overexploitation of the Tordra River aquifer for drinking water due to tourism and severe droughts in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The average volume of recycled water produced in 2009 was 80,000 m3 . One of the benefits of this project was the reduction of freshwater consumption through the use of recycled water for various activities (landscape irrigation, municipal services, etc.) and environmental protection (restoration of the Sa Riera park and local stream).40–42   Cyprus : There is a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Amathus-Limassol that, with the purpose of Nonpotable (urban and agricultural reuse), a project in 1992 has been started. This project’s main drivers for implementation were severe drought leading to water restrictions and increasing water demand (population growth and tourism). The capacity of the Limassol WWTP in 2008 was 40,000 m3 /day (270,000 p.e.). Reclaimed water production was 6.7 MCM/y in 2011 4.8 MCM were used for agricultural purposes, 1.2 MCM discharged to sea, and 0.7 MCM sent to Polemidia dam. The benefits of this project were freshwater resources savings, preservation of the natural environment, and conservation of the region’s sustainable development.43,44   United Kingdom : There is a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Old Ford Water, London, Olympic Park that the purpose of a nonpotable (urban reuse), a project in 2011, has started with a cost of £7 M. This project’s main drivers for implementation were Over-Droughts and Rapid population growth. The average reclamation plant capacity was 574 m3 /day. The benefits of this project were that in 2014, the scheme recycled 41,000 m3  of treated wastewater to irrigate the parklands and 4200 m3  for nonpotable usage at the Copper Box sports venue (equal to 19% of the site’s water consumption), with a 40% water reduction in potable water use.43,45   Algeria : There is a municipal wastewater treatment plant in the City of Sidi Bel Abbes (North-Western Algeria) with the purpose of nonpotable (agricultural reuse) from 2014 to 2017. The capacity calculated for the wastewater treatment plant was 28000 m3 /day. The planned irrigation plain has an area of about two thousand hectares. The overall efficiency of the processing plant is satisfactory, and it has  well-treated water quality characteristics for irrigation reuse in an environmentally friendly manner. Depending on the crops for irrigation, According to the development and the nature of the necessary or recommended improvements, the proposed irrigation environment can be classified into five categories, of which only three categories are irrigable. This project was able to coverapproximately 1618 ha of area for irrigation.21   Irrigation of agricultural land is one of the most used cases of wastewater reuse. Treated municipal wastewater contains various nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and potassium, which can be a good food source for plants. Since the composition of wastewater may change due to different conditions, the continuous monitoring of treated wastewater and its risk assessment on plants according to the standards of the World Health Organization should be given attention.  5.8 Conclusion Due to the growth of the population all around the world and the increase in demand for clean water, and on the other hand, the lack of safe and sanitary water resources, water reuse will be an inevitable solution. The new approach to sustainable water resources management relies on local participation, solutions, and knowledge within the water and natural resource planning framework. The project’s sustainability should be determined based on the environmental, social, and economic benefits over the entire project period, considering the costs. Reuse of water is possible only by using appropriate potentials. There is a shortage of skilled human resources in developing countries to meet the challenges of water recycling and reuse. Although the international community considers the safe reuse of wastewater as an effective solution, its correct implementation will require more studies to implement guidelines and regulations in accordance with international standards. Therefore the important reasons for the nonimplementation of these projects can be the lack of understanding of the capacity of communities to manage and the system’s poor performance due to the lack of skilled experts or the high operating and maintenance costs. The key and important solution for the success of water recycling and reuse programs can be the participation of stakeholders in the decision-making process. Therefore community participation guarantees a correct understanding of local needs and capacities. For developing countries, recycling and reusing water should be considered a common and necessary method to compensate for drought through the formulation of guidelines, standards, and criteria for quality, public health, and environmental protection.
