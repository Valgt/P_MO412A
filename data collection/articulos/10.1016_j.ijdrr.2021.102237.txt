                  For decades, climate change —perhaps the world's most controversial issue continues to wreak havoc in almost all countries. This is witnessed in the increasing number of natural disasters and most notably in Asia and the Pacific (APAC), the region reported to be more afflicted than any other part of the world. Based on a multisource global data, we analyzed the trends, nature, and impacts of floods in the five sub-regions of APAC, including East and North-East Asia (ENEA), North and Central Asia (NCA), Southeast Asia (SEA), South and South-West Asia (SSWA), and the Pacific and Oceania (Pacific) between 1990 and 2018. The paper also described their implications on the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG13) —which calls on governments to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Analysis revealed upward trends of flood occurrences and impacts across the sub-regions of APAC. This not only poses a threat of undermining the economic growth and development attained over years as well as poverty eradication in APAC, especially in regions of ENEA, SEA and SSWA but also in curtailing the progress of achieving sustainable development by 2030. Fortunately, this study the first of its kind to explore the linkage between floods and SDGs strived to explain in particular, how SDG13 offers some of the salient mechanisms under its 5 targets to be leveraged in addressing and minimizing floods and their impacts in APAC. In turn, this contributes to the scientific knowledge for informing flood risk management in APAC and elsewhere.

Institute for Disaster Management and Reconstruction Sichuan University-Hong Kong Polytechnic University Chengdu Sichuan 610200 China       For decades, climate change —perhaps the world's most controversial issue continues to wreak havoc in almost all countries. This is witnessed in the increasing number of natural disasters and most notably in Asia and the Pacific (APAC), the region reported to be more afflicted than any other part of the world. Based on a multisource global data, we analyzed the trends, nature, and impacts of floods in the five sub-regions of APAC, including East and North-East Asia (ENEA), North and Central Asia (NCA), Southeast Asia (SEA), South and South-West Asia (SSWA), and the Pacific and Oceania (Pacific) between 1990 and 2018. The paper also described their implications on the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG13) —which calls on governments to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Analysis revealed upward trends of flood occurrences and impacts across the sub-regions of APAC. This not only poses a threat of undermining the economic growth and development attained over years as well as poverty eradication in APAC, especially in regions of ENEA, SEA and SSWA but also in curtailing the progress of achieving sustainable development by 2030. Fortunately, this study the first of its kind to explore the linkage between floods and SDGs strived to explain in particular, how SDG13 offers some of the salient mechanisms under its 5 targets to be leveraged in addressing and minimizing floods and their impacts in APAC. In turn, this contributes to the scientific knowledge for informing flood risk management in APAC and elsewhere.

While no single country is immune to the phenomena of climate change, the low-income countries (LICs) and Smallest Islands Developing States (SIDS) not only witness its consequences such as frequent floods, tropical storms and cyclones striking with a higher intensity as well as the prolonged drought but also suffer most from a number of their adverse effects [1 ,2 ]. Despite the global scale of climate change, the suffering caused by such disasters triggered by natural hazards remains unevenly distributed between different regions and groups of people. The Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and on the other hand, East Asia, South Asia and the Pacific Islands —which make-up the broader bloc of the Asia and the Pacific (APAC) region are reported to be the world's most afflicted regions by the inter-annual climate variations and natural disasters [3–6 ]. Apart from the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [7 ,8 ] one of the visible anthropogenic impacts of climate change is the increasing number of floods and other climate-related extremes like drought and tropical cyclones which are reported to account for over 90% of global disasters [1 ,2 ,9–11 ]. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), climate change threatens the pathways of achieving economic growth and development [1 ,12 ]. To this matter, it is undeniable that the quest of achieving sustainable development in APAC is likely to be compromised given the region's high vulnerability to climate change and its associated hazards. Despite being one of the most dynamic regions in the world to have remarkably registered economic progress and development in recent years [13 ], APAC annually borne the lion's share of natural disasters with over 70% of its entire population affected [14 ,15 ]. A breadth of evidence on this points to some of the world's worst disasters with a high fatality, injury, disability, extensive economic damages and losses and other grave impacts that struck some countries within APAC, for example, the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan [16 ,17 ]; 2004 Asian tsunami [17–20 ]; 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China [17 ,21 ]; 2009 Victorian bushfires in Australia [17 ,22 ,23 ]; 2010 Yangtze river floods; 2010 record-breaking Russian heatwave [17 ,23 ,24 ]; and the 2018 Indonesian earthquake and tsunami [17 ,25 ]. With the global mean temperature projected to surpass 1.5 °C by 2100 [1 ,7 ], more significant impacts of climate change are likely to decimate millions of peoples’ lives and to cause billions worth of dollars in economic damages and losses in APAC and elsewhere. In this regard, a big concern arises about the preparedness of countries in APAC to adequately address the global burden of climate change and associated hazards, particularly floods —which frequently affect APAC compared to other regions. There is a promise, however, through the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG13) —which is part of the 17 universal goals that were adopted in September 2015 as a comprehensive global plan of action for tackling the global challenges to achieve sustainable development [26 ]. This goal comprises of 5 targets (as they officially presented by the United Nations are included as a supplementary file) with an exclusive purpose that requires the governments to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”. However, for effective implementation of this SDG, it is important to identify the settings across the globe most prone to climate change as well as to establish the trends and nature of its most associated impacts they witness, for example, floods. Therefore, the aims of this study were two: first, to identify the trends, nature, and impacts of floods in the five sub-regions of APAC between 1990 and 2018 based on analysis of global data from multisource and second, to facilitate the understanding of their implications on achieving SDG13.  2 Methods 2.1 Study setting APAC is located in and near the Western Pacific Ocean and is the largest intergovernmental regional platform with a membership of 53 states and 9 associate members [15 ,23 ,25 ,27 ] (Fig. 1  ). The APAC region is an immerse region covering 2.8 billion hectares of land area —which is approximate 22% of the global land area. Out of the 62 total members (the associate members inclusive) of APAC only 56 countries distributed across the 5 sub-regions, including East and North-East Asia (ENEA), North and Central Asia (NCA), Southeast Asia (SEA), South and South-West Asia (SSWA), and the Pacific and Oceania (Pacific) were considered in this study (Fig. 1 ). It should be noted that although France, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States of America are among the member countries of APAC, we excluded them in the analysis since they are not listed among its 5 sub-regions in the current and previous ESCAP reports [23 ,25 ,27 ,28 ]. APAC is a home to over 60% of the world's population [23 ,25 ] —which is currently estimated at 4.3 billion (with the majority of it being concentrated in China and India) [29 ]. Besides, some of the world's SIDS are also located in APAC (Fig. 1 ). More so, apart from being a home to some of the world's economic engines such as Mumbai, Beijing, Osaka, Tokyo and Bangkok [30 ]; APAC is enduring an unprecedented urban transition which is characterized by a sprawl of more megacities, for instance, Dhaka, Manila, Taipei, Tokyo, and Seoul. Unfortunately, some of these cities are located in the high disaster risk areas of floods, earthquakes and other hazardous weather conditions based on the Global City Risk Index [14 ,27 ,31 ]. This is why it is projected that between 2015 and 2030 the population in the extreme-risk areas of APAC will grow more than 50% in 26 cities, and by 35%–50% in 72 cities [27 ,29 ]. Moreover, APAC is a home of some top global carbon emitters that contribute significantly to the high levels of GHEs [32 ]. Thus, these socioeconomic dynamics mainly —beleaguered with the high vulnerability of APAC to both climate change and natural disasters such as floods motivated the choice for considering it in the present study.  2.2 Data sources Data related to natural disasters for this study were primarily retrieved from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) between 1990 and 2018 (28 years). EM-DAT is an international database managed by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at Louvain University, Belgium with support from the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) [17 ]. It is an open-access database containing essential data about the occurrence and effects of over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to date. The data is recorded based on national, regional, and global distributions. The criteria for EM-DAT database entry for any disaster reported should at least fulfill one of the following criteria: 1) ten or more deaths were reported; 2) one hundred or more people were affected; 3) declared a state of emergency; and 4) called for international assistance [33 ]. Once data is entered in EM-DAT it should include these variables: year; the country in which the disaster occurred; occurrence; disaster group; disaster type; the number of total deaths; the number of people injured; the number of people declared homeless; the number of people affected; and estimated economic damage. EM-DAT was chosen as the primary source of data for this study because, apart from providing historical and current data from 1900 to date on different types of disasters; it remains one of the most comprehensive and widely used global databases on natural disasters [17 ,34 ,35 ]. Moreover, EM-DAT data is more reliable since it is compiled from different sources such as the United Nations (UN) agencies, governments, development partners (like World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB)), National Disaster Management Organizations (NDMOs) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). Also, other data sources were considered for the analysis to complement EM-DAT in case of any missing data or discrepancies and they included: DesInventar —a database developed by the Network for Social Studies in Disaster Prevention in Latin America and contains a historical inventory of disasters and a methodology for analysis [36 ] and NatCatSERVICE —a database managed by Munich Re with a focus on the financial losses of disasters [37 ]. On the other hand, world disaster reports which are annually published by IFRC were also reviewed as it was deemed necessary.  2.3 Data extraction Between February and August 2019, EM-DAT was queried using its “Advanced Search” function to retrieve data on floods that were recorded to have occurred in a period between 1990 and 2018 among the 56 countries. They were aggregated according to the 5 sub-regions of APAC (Fig. 1 ). Retrieved data contained the following variables: i) year, ii) International Standard Organization (ISO) code, iii) country name iv) disaster type, v) occurrence, vi) total deaths, vi) injured, vii) affected, vii) homeless, ix) total affected, and x) total damage (000’$). By using the “save table” function of EM-DAT, the retrieved data were exported to a CSV file (Comma-separated values) for organizing, cleaning and sorting to ensure that they were accurate and consistent. Flood occurrence(s) without recorded or missing data were removed but after cross-checking with other authenticated data sources or reports. In this case, extra data searching, double-checking and corroboration were done while referring to the DesInventar and NatCatSERVICE as well as by reviewing the world disaster reports published by IFRC. Apart from identifying the missing data, this also helped in the cross-referencing and verification of the retrieved data from EM-DAT to overcome any of their inherent limitations, especially those related to recording bias. Where no results were found with the missing data, a case was marked with zero (0) for easy understanding that there no record or data was published.  2.4 Data analysis Retrieved data were descriptively quantified as summarized in Tables 1 and 2    by using the as a CSV file in four steps —which latter helped to inform the trend correlation. First, each flood event along with 9 variables was classified according to three types (coastal, flash and riverine). Second, all retrieved flood events were sorted in ascending order by each year (from 1990 to 2018) to facilitate the three phases of trend analysis which are presented later. Third, the total sums in each respective country in APAC according to years were calculated by specifically considering the number of occurrences, deaths, injured, total affected and total economic damage attributed to floods. Fourth, all countries along with the 9 variables were organized in their respective 5 sub-regions of APAC. This sort to help to identify the sub-regions as well as countries with both the highest and lowest number of occurrences, deaths, injured, total affected population and total economic damage attributed to floods between 1990 and 2018.  2.5 Trend correlation Based on the assembled data and its appropriate variables, R language (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to demonstrate the trends of flood occurrences and associated deaths, injured people, total affected population and total economic damage among the 5 sub-regions of APAC. Trend polylines were generated to visualize and analyze both the inter-annual fluctuations and variations in the trends among the 5 sub-regions as well as the overall trend in APAC as a whole by using the linear regression in three phases including phase I (1990–2000), phase II (2001–2010), and phase III (2011–2018) (see Figs. 2–6      ). These phases represent the periods of mild, severe and extreme weather, respectively —which were decided based on the years when various weather events of different magnitudes and particularly floods occurred. Besides, extreme values that might affect the illustration of the trends were removed when generating the regression lines to help in examining their implication on the 5 targets of SDG13. On the other hand, Box and Whisker plots were used to show the distribution of flood occurrences and associated impacts namely; deaths, injured people, total affected population and total economic damage in the 10 most-affected countries based on the bottom and top quartiles, representing 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively (Fig. 7  ).  2.6 Mapping Using a spatial database, digital maps of each country unit in their respective sub-regions were built using ArcGIS. This involved adopting two approaches —the management for spatial data as well as an overlay analysis function of the GIS. By using data management tools, target areas with data were selected and located and the coordinate systems of single factor maps at different scales were transformed into the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) coordinate system on the other hand. In an overlay analysis, the symbology features were applied to visualize the three types of floods across 56 countries and 5 sub-regions of APAC (Fig. 1 ).  2.7 Ethical approval Ethical clearance(s) were not necessary since this study relied on the secondary data that is freely available and accessible in EM-DAT and additional sources (DesInventar, NatCatSERVICE and IFRC reports). However, to use data for EM-DAT requires registration and this was done by the author (BKJ).   3 Results The summarized results after querying EM-DAT (and verifying them where the need arose with other data sources, including DesInventar, NatCatSERVICE and IFRC reports) for the trends, nature and impacts of floods in the five sub-regions of APAC between 1990 and 2018 are presented in Table 1 . 3.1 Occurrence According to Table 1 , more than a third of floods happened in SSWA (36.6%) of all the total floods (1,369) witnessed in the 5 sub-regions of APAC between 1990 and 2018. SSWA was followed by SEA (30.8%), then ENEA (18.7%), NCA (7.9%) and PO (6.1%). Interestingly based on Fig. 2 , the most affected region of SSWA recorded a downward trend of flood occurrence unlike the four other sub-regions with the upwards trends of occurrence in phase I. Apart from ENEA and NCA with a declining flood trend, the other 3 sub-regions recorded a swift upward trend of flood occurrence in phase II. All 4 sub-regions recorded a sharp downward trend in phase III on the other hand (Fig. 2 ). Surprisingly, an overall trend of flood occurrence for all the 5 sub-regions of APAC showed a progressive upward trend of floods in the 28 years considered for this analysis despite the observed variability in the three phases. Probably, this is attributable to the changing weather conditions over years analyzed in this study which has been characterized by increasing natural disasters and particularly floods. China, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Afghanistan and Russia (based on their top whiskers in Fig. 7 ) were the most prone countries amongst the top 10 flood-affected. This can be attributed to various reasons not only limited to their hydrology and land topography patterns, especially when overflowing of water extends from rivers, lakes and mountainous areas during the Asian torrential monsoon rains seasons [38 ]. On the other hand, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh seemed to have been exposed to similar risk factors of floods resulting from rapid population growths and settlements in the low-lying areas [14 ,15 ] when considering their median point on the Box and whisker plot. Regarding the distribution of the three types of floods: flash and coastal (presented in numbers that correspond to the total number of their occurrences in Fig. 1 ), riverine floods were the most dominant in the 5 sub-regions of APAC and with SSWA leading other sub-regions with 364 flood occurrences (Table 2 ). This might be due to the inundation of river banks and flat low-lying land next to coasts and major rivers like the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna, Indus, Godavari, Mahanadi and Narmada [10 ].  3.2 Deaths Based on Table 1 , over 100,314 deaths caused by three types of floods were witnessed all over APC between 1990 and 2018 —with more than half of them (54.0%) recorded in SSWA followed by ENEA, SEA, NCA and Pacific with 29.3%, 15.2%, 1.1% and 0.5% respectively. In phase I (1990–2000), flood-related fatalities spiked only in ANEA and SEA compared to the other 3 sub-regions with flat curves. In phase II, except for NCA and SEA where flood-related deaths showed a decline, the 3 other sub-regions instead registered their death trends upwards. Fortunately, the trend of deaths for all 5 sub-regions drastically declined in phase III. In contrast to the trend of flood occurrence, the overall trend of deaths for the entire APAC from 1990 to 2018 instead relatively declined (Fig. 3 ). In this case, one would expect the increasing occurrence of floods in the entire APAC to also contribute to the increasing numbers of flood-related deaths but the contrary. Certainly, this might have been a result of prompting effective surveillance systems that helped in forecasting, early warning, and evacuation of populations in the most flood hazardous areas across APAC. Based on the Box and Whisker plot (Fig. 7 ), India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan registered the largest number of death toll out of the ten top-ranking countries. This could inevitably be explained by the fast-growing and poverty-stricken population living in flood hazard-exposed areas in countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh and are less able to invest in risk-reducing measures [23 ,27 ,28 ]. Still based on Fig. 7  and when taking into account their median point in the Box and Whisker plot, large numbers of populations in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nepal were similarly exposed to the risk of flood-related deaths. This could also be explained based on the fact that a high percentage of the poverty-stricken population in the three countries is concentrated in the fragile environment induced by climate change [25 ,39 ] —making it much more likely to be killed by floods and other disasters whenever they occur. Similar to the results of flood occurrences, the highest number of deaths associated with the riverine-type of floods and particularly in SSWA and ANEA (Table 2 ). Most of the death tolls could have been due to drowning and coupled with being struck by objects in fast-moving water, dying of heart attacks, electrocution or by being buried in mud or collapsed infrastructure when victims attempt to escape or trying rescuing others from high levels of moving water. This, especially, happens during the floods caused by the East Asian summer monsoons [40 ,41 ].  3.3 Injured people Over eight hundred thousand people sustained injuries as a result of floods in the entire region of APAC between 1990 and 2018 (Table 1 ). The biggest majority of them (92%) was in ENEA and followed by SSWA (5.2%) —which is similar to the case of deaths above. In the view of injury trends (Fig. 4 ), in phase I only ENEA and SEA registered upward trends of injured people; in other sub-regions, the number of injured people both flattened (NCA and SSWA) and declined (in Pacific). In phase II, aside from SEA where the number of injured people is observed to have spurred; ENEA this time round registered a decline whereas in the three other sub-regions their trend curves remained flat. In phase III, NCA and SSWA registered a decrease in the number of injured people whereas the three other sub-regions had their trend curves flat. An overall trend of the injured people all over APAC drastically declined as it did with the trend of deaths in Fig. 4 . Thus, it would be argued that the flood risk management (FRM) measures for reducing death tolls of floods, for example, tree planting, risk communication and evacuation were also similarly aligned with measures that aimed at bringing down flood-avoidable injuries in APAC between 1990 and 2018. It is noticeable from Fig. 7  that China topped the rest of the countries where the highest numbers of injured people were recorded with substantial numbers and followed by Bangladesh. Other countries with a great number of injuries included Pakistan, Indonesia and India and according to their upper quartile in the Whisker plot, they recorded almost the same numbers of injured persons. This finding again highlights how the rapidly growing and poverty-affected populations in these countries could have been exposed to the risk of sustaining flood-related injuries since were mostly concentrated in the fragile environment of floods induced by climate change [25 ,39 ]. Considering the flood types (Table 2 ), this time around flash floods, especially in NCA and Pacific are identified to have contributed most to injuries compared to the majority of flood-related occurrences and deaths attributed to riverine flood as aforementioned. Accordingly, flash floods —which abruptly happen with less or little warnings and emergency services unlike the slow-rising riverine floods are commonly associated with unintentional injuries such as musculoskeletal, fractures, falls, cuts, or lacerations sustained form the moving objects in flood-related flowing water [11 ].  3.4 Total affected population Table 1  indicates that more than 2.5 billion people were affected by floods in the 56 countries of APAC between 1990 and 2018. Like with deaths and injured people, ENEA registered the highest number of people affected (73%) and followed by SSWA (22.1%), SEA (4.6%), Pacific (0.03%) and NCA (0.20%). Tracing the trends of the affected population due to floods in APAC based on Fig. 5 , in phase I the number of the total affected people is showed to have increased in all the 5 sub-regions and with a sharp rise in SEA and SSWA particularly. In Phase II, ENEA, Pacific and SEA registered an upward trend of the total population affected by floods whereas in NCA and SSWA the numbers suddenly declined. In phase III, all the 5 sub-regions had their number of populations affected by floods substantially dropped unlike in phase I where there was an increment. Similar to deaths and injured people, the overall trend of the total population affected by floods in the entire APAC steadily declined in the 28 years (Fig. 5 ). As noted above with the case of deaths and injured people in APAC in general, it is also interesting to note similarly measures, for instance, rendering warning and evacuation of masses were undertaken in a quest to protect the most vulnerable groups of the population across 5 APAC sub-regions at risk of being affected by floods. On top of that, amongst the ten most-affected countries in APAC China, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan witnessed the highest number of the total population inundated by floods (Fig. 7 ). This, as already mentioned, could be attributed to the sprawling population in these countries, particularly those whose livelihood depended on agriculture in flood-prone areas [27 ,39 ,42 ]. In the same regard, almost the same number of the affected population in Vietnam and North Korea, the Philippines and Cambodia based on their upper whiskers and upper quartiles, respectively. Again similar to flood occurrences and deaths, the riverine floods were the commonest type of flood to be experienced in APAC as a whole and they affected most people in ENEA and SSWA (Table 2 ). Possibly, this was due to rapid population growth and associated human interference activities like agriculture, settlement and dam construction near the banks of Mekong, Yangtze and Brahmaputra rivers for example, and subsequently exposing the population to riverine floods whenever the river banks were submerged and outbursts by fast-flowing water [10 ,43 ].  3.5 Total economic damage Between 1990 and 2018, over $393 billion economic damages and losses were attributed to the floods inundating APAC (Table 1 ). Similar to results of the injured and total population affected, ENEA was the most economically devastated sub-region with a record of more than half (58.4%) of all the total economic damages that were incurred all over APAC from 1990 to 2018 due to floods. SSWA followed with over $826 million (12.9%), SEA with $614 million (4.6%), Pacific with $144 million (0.03%) and lastly NCA with $501 million (0.20%). Concerning the trends of economic damages associated with floods as seen in Fig. 6 , apart from ENEA where their trend prevailed upwards in the other 4 sub-regions their trends of economic damage instead flattened in phase I. ENEA, SSWA and Pacific had their trends for economic damages attributed to floods going upwards unlike NCA and SEA which had theirs dropping and flattening, respectively in phase II. All the 5 sub-regions recorded a substantial downward trend for economic damages aggravated by floods in phase III. Unfortunately, the overall trend for economic damages emanating from floods in the entire region of APAC between 1990 and 2018 relatively went up (Fig. 6 ). Thus, it is noticeable that the more floods occurred in APAC as a whole the more they placed a huge monetary cost on many member countries —which had remarkably registered significant economic growth and development over the years of this analysis. The impact was in terms of decline in industrial and agricultural output, destruction of property and infrastructural investments, diversion of financial resources to flood relief programmes and loss of productive labour workforce [23 ,27 ,39 ,44 ]. Fig. 7  shows China, India, Thailand, N. Korea, and Pakistan to have been the most economically devastated countries amongst the ten high-ranking in APAC although with varying figures for economic damages when consider their upper whiskers in the Box and Whisker plot. Inevitably, they arose from both the direct and indirect economic damages and losses involving among other loss of crop yields and livestock, reduction of industrial output, destruction of housing and other critical infrastructures, halting of trade and tourism activities and diversion of funds for relief programmes [15 ,23 ,27 ,39 ,44 ,45 ]. Besides, other economically top-affected countries and particularly Japan, Australia and Indonesia seem to have registered the same amounts of damages considering also their upper whiskers. Still, as noted above with the occurrences and deaths due to floods, riverine floods were the most frequent type to cause economic damages in APAC as a whole, especially in ENEA and SSWA (Table 2 ). Among other factors, they can be attributed to the fact that the region hosts some of the world's largest catchments and rivers like the Mekong, Mekong, Yangtze, Brahmaputra, Indus, Ganges and Chao Phraya [41 ] —with frequent and enormous seasonal monsoons, especially those originating from the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.   4 Discussion Over the past few years, one notable repercussion of climate change has been witnessed in the increasing numbers of floods and account for approximately 40% of all natural disasters [11 ]. Indeed, this is supported by an upward trend of flood occurrence as revealed in the present study (Fig. 2 ) and particularly in APAC —the most vulnerable region to natural disasters than the rest of the world [10 ,14 ,23 ,27 ]. This abounds to a large body of evidence that points at floods as one of the most frequent natural disasters not only being faced by APAC but also the entire globe. It is mainly reported to be intensified by global warming and climate change —which IPCC projected that, will significantly exacerbate the extreme monsoon rains throughout the rest of this century [9 ]. In APAC, floods are fueled by negative human activities and demographic patterns, for example, related to the surging populations, urbanization, migration, industrialization and environmental degradation [27 ,31 ,46 ]. These factors mostly emanate from the human occupancy, interdependence and interruption near or presence within most of the earth systems with their consequent anthropogenic effects. As a result of this, some countries such as China, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Vietnam and Afghanistan have not only become the flood most-prone countries in APAC but also in the world at large [15 ,23 ,27 ,42 ,47 ]. Thus, without resilient pathways, the systemic and unabated impacts of floods, particularly deaths, injuries and economic losses and damages this study found with uneven trends in the past 28 years (1990–2018) in the 5 sub-regions of APAC are inimical to the hard-won economic growth and development achieved over time within the regions. This is, therefore, a concern, particularly in the region's emerging countries like China, India and Thailand as well as the world's major economic powers such as Japan, Australia and Russia. It should be noted that poverty makes one more vulnerable to disaster, and disaster exacerbates poverty [27 ,28 ]. As such, floods can exacerbate economic growth disequilibrium between countries and also hamper poverty eradication on the other side, especially in the LICs and SIDs of APAC by sidelining their attempts of improving people's lives —which in-turn derail the ultimate vision of SDGs of achieving sustainable development by 2030 [26 ]. Generally speaking, floods in APAC which pose a serious threat to the livelihood and economic survivability of the populations growing at exponential rate in the region requires strategies for enabling people to cope-up with the adverse effects of not only floods but also climate change in general. One viable approach is to strengthening community resilience —which is a core of SDG13 and one of the most imperative strategies of responding to climate change and its related natural hazards [26 ]. Community resilience aims at reducing people's exposure to natural hazards and improving their ability to withstand, cope with and recover from the impacts of disasters [48 ]. Also, it helps to ensure that important sectors relied on for the survival and livelihood of the majority population remains operational during and in post-disasters, for example, in the aftermath of floods. In this and many other respects, community resilience is pivotal for the agricultural sector which is known to be depended on by many households in the rural and remote areas across the sub-regions of APAC. Yet, on average, the sector absorbs 17% of the total economic damages and losses triggered by floods and other disasters [27 ]. However, for community resilience to be effective, it ought to be a multidimensional process involving different stakeholders, including the most affected victims of floods. In this, it ought to take into great account their local and indigenous knowledge as well as the good practices they oftentimes rely on to respond to climate risks and associated natural hazards limited not only to floods [18 ,49 ]. Although most of the countries in APAC bore serious economic shocks whenever they are struck by floods, it would be a remiss not to mention that the least-developed or simple and less complex economies —typically perceived to be at high risk and vulnerable [3 ,4 ,27 ], have their absolute economic losses small relative to the level of the developed countries [44 ]. This is justified by the findings in this analysis (based on Fig. 7  and Table 2 ) indicating some of the worst economically devastated economies by floods in the 28 years. This mainly affected ENEA and SSWA — the sub-region consisting of global economic powers of China and Japan and India on the other hand which are substantially contributing to the world's GDP [13 ,14 ]. There is an enormity of evidence that estimated and described how the three countries with a legacy of floods and other natural disasters are always economically ruined when they struck them. This is explicitly witnessed following the destruction of property and infrastructure, reduction of industrial output, losses of crop yields and livestock, diversion of financial resources to cater for flood relief and recovery, and halting of trade and tourism activities [15 ,23 ,27 ,39 ,44 ,45 ]. As a consequence, this poses a serious economic effect on their fast-booming economic growth and sustainable development. To this matter, the developmental pathways undertaken in such large and emerging economies in APAC (like Thailand, Australia and Indonesia) must be integrated with the mechanisms of climate mitigation and DRR, especially those stipulated in the SDG13.2 [26 ]. This goal provides an array of measures which need to be consolidated and harmonized into any country-led, regional and international development policies, plans, processes and activities across sectors if they are to safeguard their economic growth and development from floods. The majority of the economically wreaked-havoc sub-regions and countries by floods in APAC as revealed in the present study are of high and middle-income status (Tables s1 and 2  and Fig. 7 ). No doubt, they have the potential fiscal capacity to recover from the direct and indirect damages and losses of floods. In contrast, however, other countries across sub-regions that are heavily affected and witnessed a high number of flood-induced deaths and injuries still observing from this study's findings are of poor or of LIC status, for example, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Thus, it is inevitable that these countries can seldom effectively invest in DRR and as a consequence exposing their populations to disproportionate and precarious effects of floods in terms of socioeconomic, health and environment, poverty, displacement, food insecurity, disease outbreaks and property and infrastructural destruction [6 ,8 ,11 ,13 ,18 ,20–22 ,34 ,50–55 ]. This is mainly as a result of their limited financial, technical, and institutional capacities to enable them adequately respond, cope with, resist and recover from them [1 ,4 ,9 ,14 ,23 ,25 ,27 ,28 ,39 ]. Moreover, this may also be aggravated by other challenges and particularly those related to the poor governance systems, poverty, illiteracy, poor infrastructure and inadequate manpower [1 ,56 ] —of which little doubt many LDCs and SIDS in APAC are still grappling with. In the face of the above situation and alike, one of the viable solutions lies in SDG13. a. Embracing this SDG target is of paramount importance in garnering not only the financial resources and capacity but also in ensuring that the resources are equitable and sustainable to complement climate mitigation and adaptation (CMA) and DRR, especially in the developing regions, LDCs and SIDs where they inevitably remain insufficient [14 ,56 ,57 ]. Financial resources can effectively be mobilized from both domestic and external sources, including government agencies, business entities, non-governmental organizations and philanthropists to come to aid and help the most vulnerable countries and groups of populations affected by floods across the 5 sub-regions of APAC but are financially constrained. Provision of financial resources, however, ought to strike a balance between climate adaptation and mitigation, and also taking into account the country-driven strategies, priorities and needs of developing countries and in particular the LDCs and SIDS [58 ]. Apart from being the location of emerging economic powers as mentioned above, it should be noted that APAC also hosts some of the major globe donor countries such as Australia and Japan. The two countries have been instrumental in channelling the funding assistance through their respective aid agencies —the Australian Agency for International Development and Japan International Cooperation Agency to support various CMA and DRR programs. Besides, being some of the most economically affected countries by floods in APAC as revealed in this study; Japan and Australia are major contributors to the CMA initiatives through the Green Climate Fund to expedite support for the LDCs and other developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas [57 ]. With this in mind, these countries have the potential to deliver financial assistance to LDCs, SIDS or even to the landlocked partner states to support their CMA and DRR in terms of financial, technological and capacity-building resources —which henceforth in one way another can potentially help to enhance SDG13.A. Moreover, the technological advancements and proliferation of data have been underscored as new opportunities for monitoring and tracking the progress of the SDGs [59 ]. Therefore, since some countries of APAC such as China are key global frontier for both digital and green technologies (like the low energy light bulbs, wind turbines, solar panels, electric cars and others); this should also be seized as another opportunity for exchanging and transferring various technologies amongst some of the APAC member states with limited resources for enhancing various FRM measures. In the spirit of fostering cooperation, in turn, this helps to respond to the shared and threats of floods which transcend country borders such as water-related conflicts, population migration and disease outbreaks, for example, from the transboundary rivers Mekong and Ganges [10 ,11 ,41 ,60 ]. Conversely, the role of the early warning systems (EWS) is unequivocally overarching in tracking the progress and implementation of different measures for climate mitigation and DRR ascribed SDGs. The unique role of EWS is so needed in raising public awareness in anticipation of and response to floods and their impacts [5 ,31 ]. EWS help in the delivery of timely and understandable warnings that can aid risk-informed decisions about the impending floods. Therefore, EWS are significantly required, especially in the countries of APAC where different types of floods with varying severity are occurring as suggested by the results in our study. To date, fortunately, most of the flood-affected countries in APAC have in place some EWS to facilitate FRM measures. For example, the All India Disaster Mitigation Institute (AIDMI) in liaise with other different stakeholders has been at the forefront of implementing the Trans -Boundary Early Warning Systems (TB-EWS) across India and South Asian countries, and in Nepal and Bangladesh to foster regional cooperation in responding to riverine floods [61 ]. AIDMI in collaboration, particularly with the NDMOs and the Meteorological and Hydrological bodies provided the technical assistance for strengthening the hazard detection systems and forecasting capacity —which were some of the challenges hindering the timely detection and delivery of life-saving information to authorities and local people during frequent riverine floods [5 ,61 ]. While the implementation of TEWS, TB-EWS and other EWS is a step in the right direction in augmenting SDG13.1, SDG13.3 and SDG13. b and specifically in strengthening resilience, education, awareness and capacity building [26 ]; some flood-prone countries in APAC are yet to make sufficient progress in tapping into different EWS. This is because of the challenges they face, especially those rooted in limited knowledge and capacity, shortages of skilled workforce and finances to enhance the technological innovations for EWS [5 ,19 ,61 ]. In this case, the role of EWS may not be enough in minimizing the risks and magnitude of floods but rather efforts should be taken to make their end-users to understand how they function as well as their regular updating. To ensure effective responses to floods, therefore, the applicability of various EWS needs to consider the existing policies alongside appropriate financial support, affordable technologies, robust data, education and training, and interdisciplinary collaboration of stakeholders no matter their vested interests [19 ]. Additionally to the above, apart from mobilizing the support and contribution of actors from national and local governments, regional and international bodies, the science community or the private sector; EWS ought to be people-centred and not leaving-out the most flood vulnerable communities as called for by SDG13. b across the 5 sub-regions of APAC. This is because their input in designing EWS is important in determining how they ultimately respond and avert the impacts and severity of floods onto populations [5 ]. Above all, for EWS to be more effective they need to leverage and harness some of the cost-effective digital technologies —which have been evolving over the recent years. In particular, these are more prominently anchored on information and communications technologies along with crowdsourcing, social media networks and others [62 ,63 ]. Ideally, these applications can enhance mitigation and responses to floods by supporting vulnerability and risk assessment, access and exchange of timely information, and situational analysis in not only bearing the heaviest brunt of natural hazards in the APAC region but also worldwide[3, 4 ] .  5 Conclusions By and large, tracking the progress of achieving SDGs by 2030 requires all countries and regions at large to overcome the numerous challenges, especially at this juncture when the world is predestined to face more adverse effects of climate change and particularly frequent floods. In this case, there is an urgent need for collective action from all concerned stakeholders across spectra from APAC —a region reported as being the most vulnerable than any other parts of the world to natural disasters like floods. Without prompting effective remedies, floods are likely to undermine the hard-won economic growth and development attained over time as well as the poverty eradication in APAC and as a consequence, curtails the progress of achieving sustainable development. Therefore, this study being the first of its kind to explore the linkage between floods and SDGs strived to explain how SDG13, in particular, offers some of the salient mechanisms under its 5 targets to be leveraged in addressing and minimizing the conditions known to aggravate the worrying trends and impacts of floods in APAC. No doubt this augments a wide body of scientific knowledge about FRM measures not only in East and South Asia —where floods have been identified in the present analysis to be predominant but also elsewhere. All in mind, there is a significant need ahead for accelerating further research with aid of public multisource data to also explore extensively the linkage between SDG13 and other notorious natural disasters known to ravage humanity in APAC and elsewhere globally and with the ultimate aim to effectively address their impacts on achieving sustainable development by 2030.
