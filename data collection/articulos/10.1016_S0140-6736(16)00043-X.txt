Analysis and Interpretation  Correspondence    Correspondence  Neglected tropical diseases in the Sustainable Development Goals Dirk Engels a   a Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases World Health Organization 1211 Geneva 27 Switzerland     Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have been formally recognised as a target for global action towards the Sustainable Development Goals. So can we now get rid of the word neglected? Not yet. Strangely, the NTDs were only a late addition by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators to target 3.3—to “end the epidemics of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases” by 2030.1   WHO's proposed NTD indicator—the number of people needing interventions against NTDs—captures a broad set of existing targets with political endorsement by the World Health Assembly, including 11 goals to eradicate or eliminate diseases.2   This indicator counts more than a billion people in low-income, middle-income, and even high-income countries. The proposal of this global NTD indicator shows an aspiration to deliver a package of interventions centred on the poorest and most marginalised populations. I am of course pleased that the Inter-Agency and Expert Group has given a permission to go ahead with our indicator at its second meeting on Oct 26–28, in Bangkok.3   The exclusion of NTDs from the list of indicators for target 3.3 would have been an early setback to the pledge to “leave no one behind”.4   But the inclusion of NTDs is no guarantee of success. The NTD community needs to continue to think outside of the box—the box numbered 3.3. WHO's Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases has been promoting not only the NTD indicators but also NTD tracers of equity relevant to other Sustainable Development Goal targets. These tracers of equity were proposed as a contribution of the NTD community to monitor equity and fairness in progress toward other Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including universal health coverage (target 3.8), universal access to safe water (target 6.1), and sanitation (target 6.2).5   These tracers are essential to monitor equity precisely because NTD endemic populations are the least likely to have access to these services at present.6   I do not share the opinion that the main outcome for the inclusion of NTDs within the Sustainable Development Goals would be more money for NTDs.7   Inclusion of NTD indicators and tracers will, on the contrary, help to maximise returns on investment in a broad portfolio of Sustainable Development Goal targets. Inclusion will help to identify the communities that have the greatest need for attainment of these goals: the populations that are the furthest behind in terms of development. I declare no competing interests.
