                  This study critically evaluates the contributions of the Journal of Innovation & Knowledge (JIK) toward advancing research aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol for systematic literature review. We meticulously examine JIK’s interdisciplinary research patterns, thematic focuses, and topic evolution, emphasizing the journal’s engagement with SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 4 (Quality Education). By utilizing advanced techniques such as co-citation mapping and BERTopic modeling, this study identifies six major topics within the JIK, aligning with specific SDGs: “EcoTech Revolution” highlights ‘green technology,’ “Entrepreneurial Innovation” focuses on ‘innovation management,’ “Economy 4.0” centers on ‘digital transformation,’ “Effectual Innovation” involves ‘technological innovation capability,’ “Collaborative Economy” addresses ‘sharing economy sustainability,’ and “Green Innovation” explores ‘eco-innovation.’ These topics underscore JIK’s role in advancing interdisciplinary research across key areas such as technology, entrepreneurship, the digital economy, practical innovation applications, collaborative consumption models, and environmental sustainability. Our findings highlight gaps, particularly in addressing SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 15 (Life on Land), presenting opportunities for JIK to diversify its research agenda toward a more inclusive sustainability discourse. Contributions from a global array of authors underscore JIK’s international impact and its role in fostering diverse sustainability perspectives.

Contributions from a global array of authors underscore JIK ’s international impact and its role in fostering diverse sustainability perspectives.   Keywords Sustainable development goal  Innovation  Knowledge  Digital transformation  Entrepreneurship  Topic modeling  Citation clusters   JEL Code O30  Q01    Introduction In commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Journal of Innovation & Knowledge  (JIK ) and its substantial contributions to sustainable development goals (SDGs), this article delves into the previously uncharted territories of the intricate linkages, extent of impact, and scope of JIK ’s coverage of the 17 SDGs. These unexplored areas underscore the need for a focused review that not only encapsulates JIK ’s contributions but also contextualizes them within the broader agenda of sustainable development. Amidst escalating global challenges such as social disparities, environmental shifts, emerging health threats, and population growth, the pursuit of the SDGs has never been urgent or critical. Innovation and knowledge serve as the twin pillars for progress, touching every aspect of human experience. They drive economic growth (Kraus et al., 2021 ), foster social inclusion, and promote environmental stewardship (Ferasso et al., 2020 ). Equally vital, they underpin technology integration (Duan et al., 2019 ; Dwivedi et al., 2021 ) and facilitate digital transformation (Pappas et al., 2019 ; Benavides-Espinosa et al., 2024 ). Thus, together, they contribute to creating a resilient framework for a sustainable and prosperous future (Sachs et al., 2022 ). JIK  has served as a cornerstone in providing rigorous analysis and deep insights into the multifaceted aspects of innovation and knowledge. This has been evidenced by systematically exploring the antecedents of innovation, elucidating the factors that initiate and accelerate the innovation process, positing diverse influences shaping its trajectory, and positing strategic imperatives for sustaining innovation. The journal’s contributions have been pivotal to knowledge management, showcasing the mechanisms of creation, sharing, and application of knowledge. The establishment of the SDGs in 2015 marked a critical shift toward a global agenda focused on sustainable and equitable development (Gupta & Vegelin, 2016 ). This transition underscores the critical role of innovation in addressing complex challenges across the environmental, social, and economic domains. In this context, innovation encompasses not only technological advancements but also novel approaches (Sachs et al., 2019 ), systems thinking (Barbier & Burgess, 2017 ; Missimer et al., 2017 ), and collaborative models that drive sustainable outcomes. JIK ’s rigorous publications echo this ethos and serve as a comprehensive repository of studies that have examined the symbiotic relationships among innovations, knowledge management, and sustainability. Notable examples include green innovations (Wang et al., 2022 ; Shahzad et al., 2022 ) aimed at sustainable growth, technological innovations that foster high-tech industry development, frugal innovations suited for developing economies, radical innovations that disrupt existing markets, social innovations that address complex societal challenges, and entrepreneurial innovations that drive new business creation and market opportunities. The global reach of studies featured within JIK  provides critical insights into the complex interrelations between policy frameworks, cultural influences, technological advancements, and, more importantly, the scalability of innovation and knowledge management practices across diverse contexts (Li et al., 2023 ). JIK  not only championed groundbreaking and forward-thinking concepts but also upheld the highest standards of academic rigor with the dedicated efforts of 94 editors, including 6 regional editors and 88 area editors, hailing from a global network of 22 countries. In just 10 years since its inception, according to Scopus, the journal is ranked 12th in the subject areas of Economics, Econometrics, and Finance (among 705 sources) and 9th in Management of Technology and Innovation (among 281 sources), while also being rated as an “A” category journal on the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) Journal Quality List (JQL). Furthermore, the journal has a CiteScore of 14.9 and a source normalized impact per paper (SNIP) of 4.673, two key metrics indicative of its superiority in attracting citations that translate to quality. This means that articles published between 2019 and 2022 received an average of 14.9 citations in 2022 alone, which is 4.673 times the average number of citations articles in the subject area received. JIK  has an impact factor of 18.1, meaning that the total number of citations received in 2022 was 18.1 times the number of articles published in 2020 and 2021. The remarkable surge in Web of Science (WoS) impact metrics of >300 % between 2019 and 2022 is symptomatic of its growing influence and academic significance. Despite the impressive metrics that underscore the journal’s remarkable success and influence, it is surprising that no previous attempt has been made to map its contributions to the SDGs. Addressing this gap, it becomes essential to examine JIK ’s impact and its role in advancing knowledge, particularly concerning the SDGs. Understanding the contributions of the journal in this direction can offer valuable insights for researchers and policymakers, guiding future scholarly endeavors. Several key contributions distinguish our work. First, we provide a comprehensive synthesis by distilling the vast array of insights from JIK  publications since the journal started in 2016. This synthesis not only highlights seminal works and emerging trends but also delineates how JIK  publications have been instrumental in advancing research surrounding the SDGs, setting the stage for future scholarly endeavors. Second, our analysis pays tribute to JIK ’s decade of excellence, a period that, despite its relative brevity, has seen JIK  ascend to notable prominence in its field. Through a scientometric examination, we reveal the evolving publication trends, key articles, and dominant themes that have shaped JIK ’s discourse on sustainable development. Third, we provide an in-depth assessment of JIK ’s engagement with the SDGs. This involves identifying which SDGs have been most and least emphasized, assessing the interdisciplinary nature of the research, and pinpointing the major topics and terms that define JIK ’s contributions. Fourth, our work seeks to uncover the research hotspots within JIK ’s publications, offering insights into the most influential topics and how they correlate with the SDGs. This analysis not only highlights the areas of greatest academic interest but also suggests pathways for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first retrospective review of JIK  in relation to the SDGs. The research questions explored in this context include the following:• RQ1: In what ways does JIK ’s research showcase interdisciplinary approaches, particularly in the context of addressing the SDGs?  • RQ2: Which SDGs received the most and least emphasis in JIK ’s publications, and how are these priorities reflected in the most highly cited works?  • RQ3: What are the predominant research themes within JIK , and which terms most accurately encapsulate these topics?  • RQ4: What emerging research hotspots can be identified in JIK , and how do these hotspots align with or diverge from major research topics and SDG coverage?     Research framework The research framework for analyzing SDG coverage within JIK  between 2016 and 2023 is shown in Fig. 1  . The presented framework follows a structured process using the PRISMA framework, co-citation mapping, and BERTopic modeling to develop key insights into the JIK  literature. PRISMA protocol This investigation applied the PRISMA framework to guide this systematic review, adhering to a five-step process that included identifying research questions, formulating a search strategy, conducting and screening the literature search, and analyzing the findings (Page et al., 2021 ). This structured approach enhances the reliability of the review, making PRISMA a reliable protocol for diverse fields of research (Raman et al., 2023 ; Rama et al., 2023 ). This study commenced with a comprehensive search of the Dimensions database, which was chosen for its extensive journal coverage, which significantly outstrips the Web of Science and Scopus (Singh et al., 2021 ). This search, which targeted the period from 2016 to 2023, identified 451 publications. During the screening phase, all 451 publications were meticulously evaluated for completeness, with none disqualified on the basis of missing author details or DOIs. The subsequent eligibility phase leverages proprietary algorithms within Dimensions to map publications to the 17 SDGs. This was informed by various SDG mapping initiatives, including the Aurora-Network-Global’s SDG-Queries, the University of Auckland’s SDG mapping, and Elsevier’s SDG Mapping Initiatives. These mappings facilitated the identification of 215 publications directly related to the 17 SDGs. Ultimately, all 215 eligible publications were included for detailed analysis, underscoring the efficacy of the PRISMA framework in conducting a systematic and comprehensive review of literature pertinent to SDGs.  SDG framework To gauge the extent of interdisciplinary research published in JIK , we utilize the SDGs as a framework (Raman et al., 2022 , 2024 ). In analyzing the intricate web of SDGs, it becomes evident that the success of one goal is often intertwined with advancements in others. Network analyses by Le Blanc (2015)  and Allison et al. (2016)  reveal a varied landscape of interconnections among the SDGs, with some demonstrating strong links across numerous targets and others showing less pronounced connections. Emphasizing the need for an integrated approach, Griggs et al. (2013)  recommended embedding individual sustainability goals within a comprehensive framework that reflects the synergies between the environmental, social, and economic domains. By mapping the JIK ’s research outputs to the SDGs, we aim to show how well the journal’s publications align with these interdisciplinary goals, thereby reflecting on the journal’s contribution to tackling complex, multifaceted global challenges.  Co-citation mapping Our examination uses a co-citation mapping technique to visualize the interconnectedness of SDGs (Raman et al., 2023 ). Employing the visualization tool VOSviewer (van Eck & Waltman, 2010 ), we illustrate the semantic proximity between SDGs on the basis of their joint citation frequency within the same collection of publications. The resulting map portrays each SDG as a node whose size indicates its prevalence in research, whereas the connecting lines’ thickness represents the co-citation frequency between goals, thereby highlighting the network of SDGs as a complex yet cohesive structure guiding global sustainability efforts.  Topic modeling This research adopts the BERTopic technique for topic modeling, leveraging state-of-the-art transformer models and the Class-Tf-idf-Transformer for effective topic cluster formation (Gomes et al., 2023 ). BERTopic is a cutting-edge technique that uses contextual embeddings from the BERT language model for robust topic modeling (Grootendorst, 2022 ). It not only excels in capturing nuanced semantic relationships within textual data but also provides a quantitative measure of intertopic distance, offering insights into the thematic cohesion and divergence present in the content. The methodological advantage of BERTopic lies in its ability to discern subtle contextual nuances, ensuring a more accurate representation of topic clusters. This method ensures the extraction of coherent topics while preserving essential terms, significantly improving the clarity and relevance of the topics identified (Grootendorst, 2022 ). The initial step involves comprehensive data preprocessing, incorporating text cleaning, the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and tokenization to refine the dataset’s quality and uniformity. Further enhancement is achieved through sentence embeddings and dimensionality reduction techniques, facilitating more precise topic extraction and visualization (McInnes et al., 2020 ). The BERTopic model uses probability metrics to assign topics to documents, thereby improving the interpretability of the results. This approach not only guarantees the robustness and validity of the study’s outcomes but also highlights the meticulousness and sophistication inherent in the topic modeling process.   Findings Interdisciplinary research In the period spanning from 2016 to 2023, JIK  demonstrated robust performance, with a total of 215 publications, of which 198 were cited, resulting in a total of 5854 citations (refer to Table 1 in the Appendix). The average number of citations per publication was 27, contributing to an impressive h-index of 41 and a g-index of 69, reflecting the significant impact of the journal’s publications. Over the course of eight active years, JIK  maintained consistent productivity, with an average of 27 publications per active year. In terms of co-authorship, the journal exhibited high collaboration, with 721 contributing authors and 671 affiliated authors, resulting in an average of four authors per coauthored article. Notably, 657 authors contributed to coauthored documents, whereas 17 contributed to single-authored documents, showing a collaborative approach in the scholarly endeavors reported in JIK . Furthermore, when RQ1 is addressed in assessing JIK  research alignment with SDGs, a distinct pattern emerges, highlighting the journal’s focal areas (refer to Panel C, Table 1 in the Appendix). The most researched SDG within JIK  is SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), which commands the forefront with 112 publications and a remarkable citation count of 3746. This pre-eminence underscores the journal’s dedication to advancing research in innovations critical to sustainable development. The next most common are SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 4 (Quality Education), with 33 and 25 publications and 875 and 480 citations, respectively, indicating a robust interest in the economic and educational dimensions of sustainability. Conversely, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13 (Climate Action) also receive considerable attention, reflecting a moderate level of research engagement and citation impact, in line with global energy and environmental concerns. Other SDGs, such as SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), depict a more modest level of research output, suggesting areas for potential growth within the journal’s scope. At the lower end of the spectrum, SDGs such as 1 (No Poverty), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), 14 (Life Below Water), and notably, 5 (Gender Equality) and 15 (Life on Land) receive the least scholarly attention, both in terms of publications and citations. This may provide an opportunity for JIK  to broaden its research agenda to encompass a wider array of sustainability goals in the future.  SDG co-citation map In examining the contributions of JIK  to SDGs, the cocitation map (Fig. 2  ), alongside the journal keywords, we address RQ2 in understanding the interplay between various SDGs and the thematic focus of the research within JIK .
