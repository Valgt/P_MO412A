                  Food supply chains face challenges of sustainable supply chain management, such as waste management and environmental issues. Vertical integration or system integration is a corporate strategy for chicken production managed by the focal company. This research study discusses the role of the focal company for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) in a Brazilian food poultry supply chain. The research consisted of a single case study with the following steps: literature review, identification of the gaps, concepts synthesis, and case study. The findings indicated theoretical and empirical guidelines for SDGs. The literature review indicated the relevance of exploring some approaches to achieve sustainable supply chain management: corporate social responsibility, green supply chain management, industrial ecology, stakeholder theory, circular economy (reduce, reuse, and recycle with economic prosperity), and sustainability science. The focal company plays a strategic role in the vertical integration operation of the Brazilian poultry supply chain. The case study findings indicate the role of the focal company toward the actors, including the feed mill supplier, live poultry transport, poultry processor, rendering plant, and distributor. However, much remains to be accomplished to answer the question “how to be sustainable?“, especially in environmental and social issues involving all actors in the poultry supply chain. The Brazilian environmental legislation still needs to be revised to be aligned with SDGs because the legislation will not guarantee sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources. The critical issues and challenges are radical changes in business models, measurement of supply chain impacts, collaboration and network picturing, corporate social responsibility versus supply chain responsibility, stakeholder engagement, frameworks to implement SDGs, education about SDGs and public participation, and food supply chain integrated system forums.

Keywords sustainable  Food  Poultry  Focal company  Supply chain  Waste    1 Introduction In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which included 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 sustainable specific targets, indicators, and metrics (UN, 2015 ). The research of Sullivan et al. (2018)  indicated the following goals as relevant to industrial ecology: affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation and infrastructure, responsible consumption and production, and climate action. Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) aim to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO1  1 FAO: http://www.fao.org/energy/agrifood-chains/food-loss/en/ .  ) indicated that the food production rate will not accompany the growth of the food consumption rate. In other words, within a few years, there will be an imbalance between the supply and the demand so that scarce supply will increase food prices. Consequently, agri-food and agro-industrial studies in production patterns are research opportunities. Brazil has a privileged position in broiler meat production in the international markets due to factors such as the abundance of land, fertile soil to produce feedstuff, favorable climate, and innovativeness of the companies in overcoming challenges (Nääs et al., 2015 ). The preservation of natural resources becomes a significant competitive advantage for Brazilian poultry companies. The Southern Brazilian region concentrated 59% of the Brazilian poultry slaughter in 2015 according to IBGE2  2 IBGE: Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. http://www.ibge.gov.br/ .   and 63.5% of the Brazilian poultry farms in 2014 according to ABPA.3  3 ABPA: Brazilian Association of Animal Protein. http://www.abpa-br.com.br/  or http://www.brazilianchicken.com.br/en .   Brazil has approximately 180,000 farms dedicated to the poultry supply chain. BRF4  4 BRF is a global food industry company with more than 100 thousand employees worldwide.   and JBS5  5 JBS is a global food industry company with over 235 thousand employees worldwide.   companies slaughtered 2.6 billion chickens in 2014, almost half of Brazil’s total figure (Campos, 2016 ). Large poultry companies, such as BRF, present evidence of being prepared for SDGs. The evidence is structured on their corporate websites: (i) sustainability guidelines and annual report, (ii) supplier chain business relationships, (iii) labor practices, (iv) eco-efficiency through environmental management, energy, water, emissions, and waste and residue, (v) animal welfare, and (vi) community (Wiese and Toporowski, 2013 ). However, the small and medium-sized poultry supply chain companies do not usually generate SDGs reports. Luo et al. (2018)  and Sullivan et al. (2018)  stated that it is necessary to search concepts and methods to bridge the gap between business practices and sustainable developments. There are critical issues and challenges for achieving SDGs. The major challenge is as follows: How do small and medium-sized poultry supply chains implement sustainable supply chain management? This research analyzes the role of the focal company, usually led by the poultry processor, in the Brazilian small and medium-sized agro-industrial supply chain. Production planning and control in the agri-food chains have faced challenges of increasing the variety of products, greater uncertainty in the behavior of demand, sales of fresh food products and the most demanding customers (Romsdal, 2014 ; Beske et al., 2014 ). Van Der Vorst et al. (2007)  highlighted that the area of supply chain management provides tools and techniques for managing consolidation for traditional manufacturing areas of consumer durable goods (cars) and semidurables (shoes and clothing), in order to support these companies to achieve superior performance. However, studies focused on the agri-food supply chain management are still modest outside the traditional areas (Luo et al., 2018 ). The literature review indicated that companies are searching for the triple bottom line  (TBL/3BL) approach (Seuring and Müller, 2008 ) (social, economic, and environmental or people, profit, and the planet) in supply chain management, the so-called the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) (Shamsuddoha, 2015 ; Pagell and Shevchenko, 2014 ). The economic aspect is a strategic factor for the management of any chain. However, the companies should also consider the social and environmental elements, to ensure access to human and natural resources, promoting SSCM (Seuring and Müller, 2008 ). The focal company has a strategic role in SSCM (Seuring and Müller, 2008 ; Carvalho and Barbieri, 2013 ; Vaccaro et al., 2010 ; Shamsuddoha, 2015 ). The strategic role opens space to implement new trends in sustainability, such as corporate social responsibility (Kovács, 2008 ; Ciliberti et al., 2011 ; Wiese and Toporowski, 2013 ; Bisogno, 2016 ; Schmidt et al., 2018 ; Scavarda et al., 2019b ), green supply chain management (Brindley and Oxborrow, 2014 ; Sellitto and Hermann, 2016 ), stakeholder theory (Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl, 2013 ; Betts et al., 2015 ; Manders et al., 2016 ; Awasthi et al., 2018 ; Bouzon et al., 2018 ; Morais and Silvestre, 2018 ), industrial ecology (Sullivan et al., 2018 ), circular economy (reduce, reuse, and recycle with economic prosperity) (Genovese et al., 2017 ; Kirchherr et al., 2017 ; Widmer et al., 2018 ; Daú et al., 2019 ), and sustainability science (Caiado et al., 2018 ). The circular economy is fundamental to the managerial area in the companies because the TBL approach must change the organizational culture. The agri-food chain structured in the vertical integration  or the integration system  is a research opportunity to apply SSCM approaches (NCC, 2012 ; Shamsuddoha, 2015 ; Chicken, 2019 ). Brazil implements the vertically integrated poultry firm  or the integrated system  of production, allowing the consolidation of the production chain and harmonizing the activity of poultry farmers and the poultry processor. Campos (2016)  estimated that approximately 90% of industrial poultry production is under the integrated system of production. The integration system  consists of permanent support to poultry producers with the assistance of agronomists and vets, with the supply of the day-old chick (DOC), feed, and medication provided by the industry. The role of the poultry farmers is to raise the birds according to the best production practices available while following the animal welfare guidelines, biosecurity and animal health procedures. Such rules and standards are monitored by a focal company, guaranteeing the traceability of the product from the farm to the table of consumers. Brazil started the implementation of the integrated system  in the 1960s, inspired by similar practices already existing in the United States (Campos, 2016 ; Chicken, 2019 ). In the context of the poultry supply chain, the management concept of the focal company emerges. It is characterized by the integration between the links in the chain, so that other links in the chain absorb some stages or business processes of these stages. Fig. 1   presents the case of the feed mill supplier, live poultry transport, poultry processor, distributor, and rendering plant, managed by the focal company. The focal company in an integration system should be committed to achieving SSCM. Shamsuddoha (2015)  identified some severe environmental costs with the dumping of wastes in vacant land, river water, and cropland, and other costs related to odor in the air and loss of water quality. In the Brazilian case, some challenges were solved by the focal company management. The waste management should be concerned with legal issues, brand reputation, and export of products. Sullivan et al. (2018)  indicated that the implementation of sustainability initiatives requires a shift from commercial behaviors toward proactive sustainability. This research study aims to discuss the role of the focal company in sustainable development goals in a Brazilian food poultry supply chain. Moreover, the research investigates: (i) the poultry supply chain and its business process links, (ii) the wastes and environmental issues, (iii) the applicability of responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and its interrelation with other SDGs, and (iv) the discussion to achieve sustainable orientation. The contributions are guidelines about SSCM approaches and their applicability in the poultry supply chain, mapping business processes and the wastes, applicability of the SDG 12, critical issues, and challenges. Bilali (2019)  stated that the sustainability transitions research field has often overlooked food systems. This Brazilian case study explores this gap, analyzing the role of the firms and industries in transitions. The international contributions are the practical case about vertical integration  or the integration system  largely used in Brazil, China, France, Malaysia, Thailand, and the United States (Shamsuddoha, 2015 ). This research proceeds as follows. Section 2  details the material, methods, and case study. Section 3.1  presents the literature review findings and discusses the role of the focal company. Section 3.2  presents the case study analysis. Section 3.3  discusses the sustainable orientation, highlighting critical next steps for the role of the focal company. Section 4  concludes the case study indicating limitations and future studies.  2 Material and methods The research study was qualitative (Barratt et al., 2011 ) in order to identify the presence or absence of concepts, such as the role of the focal company, waste management, environmental issues, and applicability of SDGs. The research study consisted of a single case study because it analyzed these concepts in a Brazilian chicken supply chain. The research methodology was based on the following steps: (i) the literature review, (ii) the identification of the gaps, (iii) the concepts synthesis, and (iv) the case study. This paper is based on a systematic review of documents indexed in Scopus, Science Direct, and Emerald Insight databases. The literature research was carried out in August of 2018, using the search query: (“focal company” AND food) OR (“focal firm” AND food). The search was limited to the period from January of 2007 to July of 2018, yielding 287 documents. The types of documents were articles and articles in press, and in the English language. The inclusion criteria comprised the search query: (stakeholder OR motivation OR network OR “supply chain” OR collaboration OR food OR sustainable OR framework OR firms OR governance OR performance OR “critical success factor” OR sustainable OR sustainability OR “supply chain management” OR green OR “supply chains” OR “food industry”). The number of documents was 32, which were screened based on titles, abstracts, and keywords. An additional 35 documents were added from exploratory research. The total number of documents was 67. The case study is a poultry supply chain in Southern Brazil that operates in an integrated system with approximately 100 poultry farms and one poultry processor. The focal company is the poultry processor founded in 1971, with approximately 1000 employees. The poultry processor is considered a small and medium-sized business because it slaughters 75,000 poultry/day, while a large enterprise slaughters 110,000 poultry/day. The company meets the Brazilian market and is authorized to export to the following regions: Canada, Chile, China, European Union, Mercosur, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and the Arab market. The destination of Brazilian broiler meat production in 2017 was 66.9% to the domestic market and 33.1% to exports. The chicken meat per capita consumption was 42.07 kg/hab. In 2017, Brazil was the second largest producer of chicken meat in the world, only behind the United States, and the largest exporter of chicken meat (ABPA, 2018 ). In the year 2018, the authors pictured (Fig. 1 ) the poultry supply chain through in-depth interviews, observations techniques, and document analysis. The in-depth interviews were with the focal company quality manager. The company quality department operates in various business processes of the poultry supply chain, and the manager has ten years of experience in the company. The manager has a degree in industrial chemistry of foods. The interviews were organized with semistructured questions about the relationship between actors in the supply chain (see Fig. 1  and Table 1  ), the mapping of wastes (Table 2  ), and SDG 12 global targets (Table 3  ). The nonparticipant observations were made with face-to-face visits to the company to validate the responses collected in the in-depth interviews. The document analysis consists of the study of information from the corporate poultry processor website, which lists reports from the institutions ABPA (2018) , CRMV, 2017 , and Fundesa (2014) . Fig. 1  presents the Brazilian poultry supply chain managed by the focal company. The Global Supply Chain Forum categorized the business relationship between members of a supply chain in four types of business process links: managed, monitored, not-managed, and non-member (Lambert and Cooper, 2000 ). This research used three business process links to describe the poultry supply chain relationships. The managed process links  are links that the focal company manages and integrates. The thickest solid lines indicate the managed process links. The monitored process links  are not as critical to the focal company. However, the focal company expects these process links to be integrated and managed appropriately between the other member companies. Thus, the focal company, as frequently as necessary, monitors or audits how the process link is integrated and managed. The thick dashed lines in Fig. 1  indicate the monitored process links. The not-managed process links  are links that the focal company is not actively involved in managing, and they are not critical enough to warrant the use of resources for monitoring. In other words, the focal company fully trusts the other members to manage the process link appropriately or because of limited resources, leaves it up to them. The thin solid lines in Fig. 1  indicate the not-managed process links (Lambert and Cooper, 2000 ). Additionally, according to Fig. 1  the focal company manages the following members: feed mill supplier, poultry processor, distributor, and rendering plant. Table 1  details the business process of the poultry supply chain and its process link types. The network structure of any supply chain managed by the focal company opens up space to explore the theoretical gaps of the types of shortened supply chains that are not necessarily in the relationship between the producer and consumer (Aubry and Kebir, 2013 ; Sini, 2014 ). Marsden et al. (2000)  identified the need to investigate how, why and under what specific conditions the development of agri-food supply chains occurs. Given the need to analyze the potential of rural development across different regions and productive sectors, Marsden et al. (2000)  identified critical parameters of the evolution of a supply chain: temporal evolution, spatial/geographic evolution, demand evolution, and evolution of associativism and institutions.  3 Results and discussion This section begins with the literature review findings, highlighting the concepts of the sustainable supply chain management, the focal company and its business process links, a discussion of the role of the focal company and some guidelines. The case study analysis presents the results of the mapping of wastes and environmental issues and discusses the role of each actor of the poultry chain. Section 3.2.2  discusses the role of the focal company in SDGs, highlighting the applicability of responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and its interrelation with other SDGs. Moreover, Section 3.3  discusses items to achieve sustainable orientation. 3.1 The literature review findings 3.1.1 The sustainable supply chain management The discussion about SDGs by the United Nations has inserted in the agenda of countries, companies, and society the commitment to the search for sustainable thinking. In this section, this research focuses on the definition of SSCM, SSCM theoretical approaches, frameworks to implement SSCM, and empirical cases. Seuring (2008)  defined SSCM as “the management of material, information, and capital flows as well as cooperation among companies along the supply chain while taking goals from all three dimensions of sustainable development: social, economic, and environmental, into account which derived from customer and stakeholder requirements”. Chopra and Meindl (2015)  categorized the factors that drive SSCM into three groups: (i) reducing risk and improving supply chain performance, (ii) managing community pressures and government legislation, and (iii) attracting consumers who value sustainability. How to achieve SDGs and, at the same time, deal with the factors highlighted by Chopra and Meindl (2015) ? In the first instance, it is necessary to explore some approaches to SSCM: corporate social responsibility, green supply chain management, industrial ecology, stakeholder theory, circular economy (reduce, reuse, and recycle with economic prosperity), and sustainability science. The traditional concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is “a concept whereby companies decide voluntarily to contribute to a better society and a cleaner environment (Kovács, 2008 )”. The Commission of the European Communities defined CSR as “a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and their interaction with their stakeholders voluntarily (Wiese and Toporowski, 2013 )”. The responsibility has considered eight areas: animal welfare, biotechnology, environment, fair trade, health and safety, labor and human rights, procurement, and community (Wiese and Toporowski, 2013 ). The hidden actions have promoted failure that affects the company’s reputation in terms of cases about failure in health and safety, animal welfare, and procurement, as analyzed by Wiese and Toporowski (2013) . The hidden actions are critical issues to supply chain management avoided through the implementation of CSR. Green supply chain management (GSCM) is the integration of environmental thinking applied to an industrial context that involves suppliers in the environmental management process. The GSCM process has followed typical activities: design, selection of raw material, green purchasing, green manufacturing, green distribution, monitoring of environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle, and reverse logistics (Akman, 2015 ). Sellitto and Hermann (2016)  presented the organizational model of green practices in GSCM, highlighting the following dimensions for operations in GSCM: green purchasing, green manufacturing, green distribution, reverse logistics, the final destination of waste, and reduction of pollution. Industrial ecology (IE) studies the flows of materials and energy in industrial and consumer activities and their influence on the environment. IE principles have focused on the industrial ecosystems developing a more holistic biological system approach to environmental management. The central idea is to analyze the industrial systems as complex industrial ecosystems integrated with broader social and biophysical environments. IE concepts and methods bridge the gap between traditional business practice and sustainable development (Sullivan et al., 2018 ). The stakeholder theory or stakeholder orientation studies concepts such as corporate planning, systems theory, corporate social responsibility, and organization theory. The stakeholder is “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization objectives (Freeman, 2010 )”. Morais and Silvestre (2018)  stated that the stakeholders are fundamental to understand SSCM. The primary stakeholders are companies that are directly involved in supply chain operations such as manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers. The secondary stakeholders are the organizations indirectly involved in the supply chain such as governments, agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and media. Another viewpoint is the internal or external stakeholders (Manders et al., 2016 ). The internal stakeholders are stakeholders within the (focal) company, such as managers and employees, while external stakeholders are stakeholders outside the organization, such as suppliers, third-party logistics service providers (3 PL), and governmental organizations. Awasthi et al. (2018)  organized the iceberg metaphor to highlight the environmental and social risks in the supplier selection by the focal company. The circular economy (CE) is an approach to minimize the use of primary resources, the 4R principles  of reducing, reusing, recycling and recovering on a micro (enterprise), meso (industrial park) and macro (regional) level (Kirchherr et al., 2017 ; Widmer et al., 2018 ). CE has aimed to create self-sustaining production systems in which materials are used over and over again (Genovese et al., 2017 ). Widmer et al. (2018)  concluded that to implement the CE principles, it is useful to differentiate between the focal company and primary stakeholders, such as the customer and the suppliers, and the recovery network and the secondary stakeholders, such as the natural environment and society. Sustainability science (SS) is an emerging field that promotes an interdisciplinary approach to think sustainably through an interactive process involving natural, social and engineering sciences (Aricò, 2014 ). Caiado et al. (2018)  organized a framework to implement SDGs and found the following critical issues: (i) investment in education and information, (ii) political leadership and governance, (iii) global integrated compromise and partnership, (iv) innovative solutions, and (v) aggregated and reliable indicators. The frameworks help managers to study approaches in order to implement SSCM. Beske et al. (2014)  organized SSCM practices: strategic orientation, supply network structure, collaboration, risk management, and pro-activity for sustainability. Beske et al. (2014)  also stated there is a lack of empirical research in food supply chains. The framework of empirical studies aims to discuss the performance of SSCM and its concepts (Seuring, 2008 ). There are many operational excellence approaches in Industrial Engineering to apply in the SSCM context, such as Lean Manufacturing, Quality Management, System Dynamics, Simulation, Six-Sigma, Reverse Logistics, Inter-organizational Information Technologies, Internet of Things, Blockchain, Industry 4.0, Theory of Constraints, 5G technology, and others. Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl (2013)  stressed the importance of empirical cases to promote corporate responsibility, strategizing, and sustainable development. Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl (2013)  presented the concepts of weak sustainability  (WS) and strong sustainability  (SS) to describe the different assumptions related to which type of development is considered sustainable. Pagell and Shevchenko (2014)  discussed the question: how to manage unsustainable supply chains more sustainably? An unsustainable supply chain would be weak regarding sustainability in line with the findings from Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl (2013) . Pagell and Shevchenko (2014)  stated that sustainability is a cultural change and empirical cases could contribute to the understanding of how to make existing supply chains more sustainable. Whenever decision makers have discussed sustainable supply chain management, the first issue they remember is the environmental issue. SDGs have sought to make clear to all nations the scope of the term sustainability, which is why researchers are studying sustainability science to promote the integration of environmental, social and economic issues (Aricò, 2014 ; Caiado et al., 2018 ). For example, the European Union has discussed widely how food supply chains play a vital role in achieving the reduction targets of C O  2     , either through the reduction of transport costs or the promotion of biodiversity. This discussion has engaged public policies, rural development, communities of small farmers/associations, and companies (Canfora, 2016 ). Shamsuddoha (2015)  identified that the poultry industry in Bangladesh is struggling to implement the sustainability concept in its operation. The struggling is due to an inappropriate poultry process network, the lack of coordination among stakeholders and the failure to maximize resource usage. In Bangladesh, the most severe environmental costs for livestock farming are from the dumping wastes in vacant land, river water, and cropland. The poultry industry is facing environmental challenges relating to air (odor) and water quality. Environmental benefits can be achieved along with business profit when firms consider the 4Rs of valuable resources from products at the end of the product life cycle or used products. The recovery process may create a new product line for a segment of existing customers, as well as new customers earning additional profitability and achieving environmental sustainability (Shamsuddoha, 2015 ). In the poultry industry, wastes are recycled and reused to recover value by making byproducts for further consumption. Chicken and eggs are the final products while intestines, feathers, unhatched eggs, eggs, and eggshells remain after the products are consumed. Such wastes help the industry to produce valuable byproducts to recover value. Poultry birds consume poultry feed, and birds generate litter (excreta). Poultry litter can be recycled to make biogas, fertilizers, animal feed, and fish feed. Wastes from biogas production can generate fertilizer and artificial charcoal (Shamsuddoha, 2015 ). Shamsuddoha (2015)  stated that SSCM should be integrated with product strategy, engineering byproducts, byproducts produced during product use, product life extension, product end-of-life, and recovery processes at end-of-life. The theoretical background indicated some approaches to implement SSCM and discussed the environmental issues used with the Bangladesh case study. There are many challenges to implement SSCM (Pagell and Shevchenko, 2014 ). However, some challenges need to be studied in-depth, for example, how do stakeholders of the poultry supply chain operate the business process? Alternatively, what is the role of the focal company to implement SSCM?  3.1.2 The focal company and its business process links Lambert and Cooper (2000)  researched the types of business process linkages that exist between members/actors in supply chain management: (i) managed business process links, (ii) monitored business process links, (iii) not-managed business process links, and (iv) non-member business process links. Fig. 1  presents the business process links and their characteristics. The business process linkages in the context of the integrated company (Bowersox et al., 2013 ) are the result of the construction of lengthy negotiations, both economic and material, in order to meet the perishable products’ lead time, facing the requirement of chain responsiveness that the differentiated products offer. The recommendations of Lambert and Cooper (2000)  are traditional in the literature of supply chain management theory. However, there is a research opportunity to apply these recommendations in the agri-food context. Food supply chains have presented some specific characteristics: (i) the freshness and the perishability of some products, (ii) the relative uncertainty that there are some quality attributes (items of credibility), the seasonality in supply and demand, the limited product shelf-life, and (iii) the low relationship between product value and logistical costs (Vlajic et al., 2012 ; Carlucci et al., 2014 ; Romsdal et al., 2014 ; Schiavo et al., 2018 ). Such characteristics are challenges for the logistic management of the supply chain because they require strong integration between producer, manufacturer, and consumer. Therefore, the new supply chain relationships have been shown to be a strategic factor for the supply chain development (Marsden et al., 2000 ). Supply chain management has consisted of managing the traditional business processes of a supply chain such as customer relationship management, customer service management, demand management, order fulfillment, manufacturing flow management, procurement, product development and commercialization, and returns processing (Van Der Vorst et al., 2007 ). The food supply chain management has applied such business processes in the agri-food and agro-industrial context considering the challenges of the specific characteristics and the relationship between actors in the chain, such as the input supplier, producer, processor, retailer, and consumer (Luo et al., 2018 ). The evolution of associativism often includes open links based on trust, shared objectives, strategic partnerships, and forms of cooperation between different actors in the supply chain. Associativism promotes the organization of farmers’ cooperatives in order to assimilate other activities in a supply chain, such as the manufacture of agro-products, and can be the starting point for modern movements acting as focal companies, seeking to integrate different actors in the chain (Marsden et al., 2000 ; Luo et al., 2018 ).  3.1.3 The role of the focal company The focal company is the member of the supply chain that provides leadership and exercises the most significant control over supply chain decisions and activities (Cooper and Ellram, 1993 ; Lambert and Cooper, 2000 ). The focal companies are those companies that usually: (i) rule or govern the supply chain, (ii) provide the direct contact to the customer, and (iii) design the product or service offered (Seuring and Müller, 2008 ). Seuring and Müller (2008)  stated that the roles of a focal company have been: (i) to promote triggers for SSCM, (ii) supplier management for risks and performance, and (iii) supply chain management for sustainable products. Seuring and Müller (2008)  stated that the role of the focal company is to manage external pressures and incentives from government, customers, and stakeholders. The barriers for SSCM have been higher costs, coordination complexity/effort, and insufficient/missing communication in the supply chain. The supporting factors for SSCM have been company-overlapping communication, environmental management systems (e.g., ISO 14001 and SA 8000), monitoring, evaluation, reporting, sanctions, training education of purchasing employees and suppliers, and integration into the corporate policy. There is a theoretical gap concerning the role of the focal company in SSCM, in particular about business processes, the business network and strategizing activities between stakeholders of food supply chains. This gap is a challenge to implement SSCM principles. Network picturing is a research area of network management and business relationships that studies how managers relate perceptions of their business network (“network picturing”) to decision-making and strategizing tasks. Network picturing represents a way to understand the boundaries of the firm and how this understanding affects managers’ decisions. In the industrial network approach, the networking decisions consist of three different dimensions: network pictures, networking activities, and network outcomes. The network pictures concept suggests that an actor interacts with the network by his/her interpretation of the network (Abrahamsen et al., 2016 ). The network picture shows how the focal company shaped itself and was reshaped in its industrial context and evolved over time (Geiger and Finch, 2010 ). In this research, the network picture was the mapping from the poultry supply chain focal company viewpoint. In Fig. 1 , the business processes links are mapped. Table 1  presents the business processes, and Table 2  presents the wastes and environmental processes. The strategizing task is planning the scope for action, potential relationships, performance of the firm, constraints, and interactions within the network context (Håkansson and Ford, 2002 ). Corporate strategizing takes a broader view when a company plays the role of a focal company in the supply chain management (Freeman, 2010 ; Harrison et al., 2010 ; Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl, 2013 ). Harrison et al. (2010)  organized five different ways of involving counterparts in strategic initiatives: (A) strategizing based on network pictures in the absence of direct interaction, (B) strategizing in the presence of a network audience, (C) strategizing among deliberate equals, (D) strategizing among imaginative equals, and (E) strategizing as an open and absorptive bystander. The focal company has a clear vision of the outcome in (A), (B), and (C). Stakeholders participated in the strategy definitions in (B), (C), and (D). What happens with the focal company’s strategy during the process? The results indicated: (A) unchanged, (B) mostly unchanged, (C) changes on some issues, (D) codesigned with the counterparts, and (E) designed by the counterparts. These five different strategizing concepts open space to discuss corporate strategizing in SSCM, now labeled as five strategizing ways (5SW). Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl (2013)  stated that stakeholder orientation could be indirect when the focal company takes responsibility for sustainable development through its stakeholders. This strategic choice fits as the option (A) of 5SW. The option (A) can have an impact on the sustainability assumption of the food supply chain in a negative manner as weak sustainability because the stakeholders can provide no engagement in sustainable development. The study of Harrison et al. (2010)  discussed five different ways of involving counterparts in strategic initiatives that could help stakeholders to plan the appropriate sustainable development orientation for the context of their agri-food supply chains. Pagell and Shevchenko (2014)  highlighted a question: “How to manage unsustainable supply chains in a more sustainable manner, to manage truly sustainable supply chains?“. The answer to Pagell and Shevchenko (2014)  is that a change in supply chain management (SCM) is necessary: “… that all SCM research, not just one stream, must address the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the supply chain”. Pagell and Shevchenko (2014)  stated that the point of no longer separating SCM and SSCM research has to be reached. The management of any focal company presents challenges similar to the findings of Battaglia et al. (2017)  about business strategic networks: (i) network configuration and development, (ii) relationship/collaboration, and (iii) negotiation of strategic alliances, and Handayati et al. (2015)  about agri-food supply chain coordination. Huang et al. (2018)  state that “research has tended to ignore collaborative analyses when investigating the consequences of enterprise collaboration. In logistics enterprises, there is a direct relationship between efficiency and collaboration, as collaboration can reduce logistics costs and the negative impact of the bullwhip effect, and increase service levels, market share and capacity”. Shamsuddoha (2015)  stated that proper coordination among the supply chain members is needed, which is always challenging and that the sustainability continues to be challenging at the corporate level in terms of applying the relevant theory to their operation when diverse stakeholders are involved. Shamsuddoha (2015)  stated that the industry needs to make an effort to implement sustainability concepts in their business operations. This research highlights the following guidelines for discussion on the role of the focal company. Collaboration : the stakeholders and the focal companies will achieve SDGs when they collaborate intensely toward the same objectives in sustainable development orientation. Strategizing supply chain : there are not only strategic objectives of the focal company but also of the entire supply chain. Environmental sustainability as a pillar : environmental issues should guide the product manufacturing life cycle, and as a consequence, the social and economic dimensions. Sustainability science : stakeholders must think about the integration of natural, social and engineering sciences.   3.2 Case study analysis This section presents the supply chain and its business processes, the mapping of wastes and the environmental issues, and the applicability of SDGs. Fig. 1  and Table 1  detail the actors, business process and link types. Morais and Silvestre (2018)  stated that stakeholders’ relationships are fundamental to understand SSCM. It is relevant to present a descriptive analysis of the business processes of the poultry chain and their relationships. The Federal Government  supervises the poultry processor, the feed mill supplier, and the rendering plant. The State Government  monitors the sanitary conditions of the broiler farm. The World Trade Organization (WTO)  regulates international marketing and the World Health Organization (WHO)  sets criteria for safe food, especially in the poultry supply chain. These actors are strategic to the poultry supply chain because the focal company exports part of the production for the external market, with destinations in different countries that it is able to export to, including the countries of Canada, Chile, China, European Union, Mercosur, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and the Arab market. The focal company closely monitors these business processes of the Federal/State government, as well as WTO and WHO. The main concerns are sanitation inspection, biosecurity, and animal welfare. In the context of SDGs, these governmental institutions must evaluate the eight CSR areas, not just the legal conditions, and protect companies from failure in health and safety, animal welfare, and procurement, as highlighted by Wiese and Toporowski (2013) . The focal company does not manage the primary breeder company , feed mill supplier  and breeder farm  because the focal company does not become involved with these actors and this role falls to the hatchery. The focal company does not manage the hatchery  and DOC transport  because it only makes the order of DOC, and the hatchery is responsible for the transport. GSCM principles could be applied to these suppliers in the monitoring mode of environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle, as highlighted by Akman (2015) . Additionally, the focal company monitors the premix supplier  because it observes the quality of blend formulations during the chicken raising process. However, the focal company manages the feed mill supplier to broiler farms  because the mixture (soybean and corn bran with the premix) is essential to the raising process. The mixture process takes place at the feed mill supplier or the broiler farm. The focal company monitors the raising process in the broiler farms  because the farmer receives guidance on how to conduct the raising process of chickens until they reach the target market weight. The focal company monitors the poultry transport crate supplier  because the crate has essential specifications for the proper transport of live poultry. Nevertheless, the focal company manages the live poultry transport  because the carrier is the responsibility of the focal company and regulated by the Federal Government. The focal company is the poultry processor and manages its processes carefully, such as the DOC buying process, reception, slaughter, scalding, defeathering, washing (evisceration and giblet processing), chilling, cutting, packing, freezing, storage and dispatch. The plants that operate in conjunction with poultry processing plants are known as integrated rendering plants . The focal company manages this plant because the meat rendering plants process animal byproduct materials for the production of tallow, grease, and high-protein meat and bone meal. IE principles have an excellent way to advance in this integration because the poultry processor already perceives the industrial environment as an industrial ecosystem, as highlighted by Sullivan et al. (2018) . The business processes in the poultry processor generate many wastes such as plastic packaging and personal protective equipment (PPE). These wastes must be sent to an industrial waste plant  and monitored by the focal company. The industrial waste plant must provide certificates of proper disposal of inorganic waste. The distributor transports the chicken meat in a refrigerated environment because product distribution requires special care since improper transportation can affect the durability and quality of the product. Thus, the focal company manages the distributor  with its fleet of refrigerated trucks and direct delivery to customers. The retail outlet , consumers , and restaurants  are the end consumers. The focal company does not manage the retail outlet , consumers , and restaurants  because it only delivers the products to them, as highlighted by Schiavo et al. (2018) . 3.2.1 The mapping of wastes and the environmental issues This section presents the wastes and the environmental issues of the poultry case study. Table 2  analyzes the role of the focal company in the business processes, the wastes, and environmental issues. The asterisk (*) indicates a difference between waste management and business process management. The focal company does not manage wastes of the premix supplier  and the poultry transport crate supplier  because it does not engage with manufacturing issues and supplier industrial waste. However, the focal company monitors the quality of blend formulations because the premix impacts the chicken raising process until reaching the target market weight. The focal company monitors the transport crate supplier because there are necessary specifications for the proper live poultry transport. Moreover, the focal company monitors the distributor  energy consumption and manages product distribution because it is exclusively concerned with the quality and durability in the delivery of its products and is unconcerned about alternative sources of energy in transport or refrigeration. The focal company does not manage the business processes and wastes of the primary breeder , feed mill supplier to the breeder farm , breeder farm , hatchery , DOC transport , retail outlet , consumers , and restaurants . The focal company does not become involved with the business processes of these stakeholders, but that does not mean that these actors are not concerned about waste management and environmental issues, only that from the focal company perspective, there is no management of such environmental issues. The focal company monitors the broiler farm  wastes and environmental issues because there are sanitation and animal welfare requirements of the government agencies and representative institutions (CRMV, 2017 ), but that does not mean that the broiler farm is not concerned with waste management and environmental issues. For example, the broiler farm recycles the organic wastes (litter, feed, and others) to composting and fertilizers. The focal company monitors the industrial waste plant  because the plant must provide certificates of proper inorganic waste disposal. The focal company does not engage in management waste and environmental issues of the industrial waste plant. The focal company manages the business processes and wastes of the feed mill supplier to the broiler farm , the poultry processor , and integrated rendering plant  because the focal company is dependent on natural resources in its production activities. For example, the poultry processor and integrated rendering plant treat 250,000 L/day of water. Water is a natural resource used in several slaughterhouse activities such as the scalding and washing (evisceration and giblet processing). The water is treated according to environmental requirements required by government agencies and returned to nature. In other words, the treated water does not return to the production process. Energy is another strategic natural resource, such as electrical energy for freezing products and wood for the boiler. The case study analysis indicated that the focal company has managed some processes of waste management and environmental issues, but not of the chain as a whole. The focal company has used a few indicators on wastes and environmental issues without historical data because it is deploying an environmental indicator system. There has been no evidence of environmental indicators on the not-managed or monitored actors by the focal company. In addition, a concern has been raised regarding waste management and the environmental impact, but it is limited to meeting the legal requirements by government agencies. A collaboration with the actors in the chain has focused on business issues, and there are many opportunities for advances in the sustainable development orientation. CE principles have promoted a sustainable development orientation. The raw materials and nonrenewable resources will be replacing them with renewable resources and biologically based inputs. The waste and byproducts are going to circulate through their reuse and recycling within the same industrial chain or will be passed on for use in other industries. Moreover, CE will extend the useful product life and assets during and after their use, in order to preserve and maximize their value. Shamsuddoha (2015)  highlighted some examples of recycling that generate byproducts from unused products (eggs, feathers, intestines) and wastes (litter, feed) and gain extra profit: poultry litter (excreta) recycle as biogas, fertilizers, animal feed, fish feed, and wastes from biogas production recycle as fertilizer and artificial charcoal, and others. Shamsuddoha (2015)  stated that the poultry industry in Bangladesh is struggling to implement the sustainability concept in its operation. The main challenges have been an inappropriate poultry process network, the lack of coordination among stakeholders and the failure to maximize resource usage. The poultry industry is facing environmental challenges relating to air (odor) and water quality, hampering the poultry industry in terms of spreading disease and maintaining optimum health. The Brazilian poultry supply chain integrated system can be a facilitator to address the challenges reported by Shamsuddoha (2015) . In Table 2 , the identified wastes and environmental issues help to understand the supply chain network picturing. The evidence indicated that the corporate strategizing of the focal company involves two main aspects. The first has been the concern with meeting the sanitation requirements in order to guarantee the certificates of a country exporting chickens. The second has been the concern with the environmental issues aligned to the requirements of government agencies and, as a consequence, the use of byproducts.  3.2.2 The applicability of responsible consumption and production This section presents the case study results about the SDG 12 and targets, and the interrelation between the SDG 12 and other SDGs. The SDG 12 aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns and presents eight specific global targets and three strategic global targets. Table 3  presents the global target of the SDG 12 and the global target’s status of the Brazilian poultry supply chain. The focal company quality manager answered semistructured questions about the targets and chose between four categories: unobserved, unstarted, started, and consolidated. The unobserved category  indicates that the interviewee knows no evidence about the target. The unstarted category  indicates that the interviewee identifies evidence about the target. However, there is no planning/execution for this target. The started category  indicates that the interviewee identifies evidence about the target and there is an initial planning/execution for this target. The consolidated category  indicates that the interviewee identifies evidence and controls for this target because there is planning, execution, and improvement for this target. After the choice of the quality manager, he should highlight qualitative evidence to prove the choice made. The evidence is presented in the following results. Regarding target 12.1, the question was whether there has been a long-term (10-year) program for sustainable consumption and production at the initiative of the focal company or any government agency or not. Target 12.1 has not been started because the respondent is aware that there was no planning with these outlined objectives. Target 12.2 has not been started because many poultry supply chains are only concerned with environmental licensing and complying with environmental legislation. The poultry supply chains managed by small and medium-sized focal companies should implement industrial ecology principles. In other words, the poultry supply chains should think about material flows and energy as complex industrial ecosystems integrated with broader social and biophysical environments. Target 12.3 has been started because there are initiatives to reduce food losses at the retail and consumer level. In other words, the restaurants have sent the chicken waste to the integrated rendering plant. The target 12.4 has been consolidated because there is a secure federal and state inspection system. Broiler farms and poultry processors would not receive authorization to operate without meeting the requirements of environmental licensing and sanitary conditions. Target 12.5 has not been started because the poultry supply chain complies with the legal requirements for operation, especially the sanitation ones, but a program does not exist to implement the principles of the circular economy (prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse of wastes). Regarding this point, the focal company could implement the stakeholder orientation to influence environmental corporate strategizing (Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl, 2013 ). Target 12.6 has not been started because the small and medium-sized poultry supply chains do not usually generate this type of report. The large focal companies with several operations and shares on the stock exchange usually implement this practice. In the world context, SDGs can be essential to the small and medium-sized poultry supply chain companies that consider implementing the CSR approach (Ciliberti et al., 2011 ; Wiese and Toporowski, 2013 ), in particular for export reasons to countries that implement SDGs. Target 12.7 has been consolidated because the poultry supply chain focuses on meeting the sustainability requirements of Brazil’s public policies, such as the requirements of environmental agencies for the collection/disposal of water and air. Target 12.8 has not been started because the poultry supply chain does not have this practice. For example, the winemaking chain encourages family farming and a sustainable lifestyle (Barbosa et al., 2018 ). Target 12.a has been started because of representative institutions, such as ABPA,6  6 ABPA: Brazilian Association of Animal Protein. http://www.brazilianchicken.com.br/en/poultry-industry/sustainability .   and federal institutions, such as EMBRAPA7  7 EMBRAPA: Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation. http://www.embrapa.br/en/international .   take actions to improve sustainability, and there is know-how to implement scientific and technological capacity. Target 12.b has not been observed because encouraging sustainable tourism is not a practice in the poultry supply chain. Regarding target 12.c, the question was whether there have been government incentives or any corporate action to rationalize the use of fossil fuels or not. Target 12.c has not been started because there is no government or corporate planning to decrease fossil fuel use. However, the policy of fossil fuel incentives makes nonfossil fuels more competitive. The wood/natural gas is used for the boiler, and electricity is used for various business processes. Additionally, freight transport in Brazil is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. SDG 12 presents interrelations with other SDGs. The authors highlighted some relationships based on case study observations and research findings: No poverty (SDG 1).  The sustainable production standard ensures employment in the poultry production chain and promotes new jobs focused on sustainable activities. Zero hunger (SDG 2).  Chicken has a lower cost and production time than other types of meat, so it can be a strategy for underdeveloped countries to eradicate hunger. Good health and well-being (SDG 3), quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), and reduced inequalities (SDG 10).  The guarantee of an income promotes the development of the families of the employees and access to quality education and health, avoiding the death of newborns and children, epidemics, social inequality, and environmental impacts. Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), and life on land (SDG 15).  Poultry supply chains must rationalize the water use and return water to the environment under human consumption conditions and promote the generation of biogas from poultry litter, rationalizing the use of forests. Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8).  Stakeholder engagement and CSR can ensure conditions that allow people to have quality jobs. Industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9) and partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).  The partnerships between universities, governments, representative institutions, focal companies, and suppliers can promote innovative practices.   3.3 Discussion to achieve sustainable orientation This section discusses items that deserve to be considered by other researchers as well as for managerial analysis of the actors in the poultry supply chains to achieve sustainable orientation.1. Radical Change in Business Models.  Businesses have to be rethought regarding innovations and management practices (Lopes et al., 2018 ). Pagell and Shevchenko (2014)  stated that companies need to change the question “does it pay to be sustainable?” to “What does value mean and how to provide value?“. In short, companies need to change the question from “does it pay?” to “how to be sustainable?“. Sullivan et al. (2018)  and Betts et al. (2015)  suggest a reframing from a resources-based view of the firm (RBV) to a natural resources-based view of the firm (NRBV). In other words, they suggest thinking about industrial ecology in line with the business strategy of poultry supply chains. Widmer et al. (2018)  concluded that there are different business models and different sustainable approaches. The research of Widmer et al. (2018)  proposed the product-service systems (PSS) circular economy and highlighted the role of the focal company in promoting SDGs.  2. Measuring Supply Chain Impacts.  The impact on the entire chain needs to be measured, not only on the focal company (Pagell and Shevchenko, 2014 ; Miranda-Ackerman et al., 2017 ). The focal company must promote the management of the sustainable business process in the suppliers, distributors, retailers, and others. Pagell and Shevchenko (2014)  suggested changes in norms, measurement, methods, and research questions. Vlajic et al. (2012) , Qorri et al. (2018)  and Huang et al. (2018)  proposed frameworks to identify vulnerabilities and key performance indicators.  3. Collaboration and Network Picturing.  Network picturing is a strategic tool to understand the business relationships in the whole chain (Abrahamsen et al., 2016 ). It is necessary to have a vision of the relationships between actors in the chain and the various networks that are part of it, such as social, economic, and environmental networks (Geiger and Finch, 2010 ). The sustainable development orientation should be a commitment of all stakeholders, not just the focal company (Zondag et al., 2017 ).  4. CSR versus Supply Chain Responsibility (SCR).  CSR should engage stakeholders as a whole (Chapman and Shigetomi, 2018 ). The food supply chain members promote economic benefits to workers and families of the region. Leadership by the focal company could organize the CSR annual report and show to the regional stakeholders (workers, families, government, and others) the social, economic and environmental achievements, as well as any challenges in the supply chain operation. The findings suggest expanding the concepts of CSR to a new approach called SCR, i.e., CSR throughout the supply chain not just in the focal company (Wiese and Toporowski, 2013 ). The challenge is that applying the SCR approach requires a considerable effort on the part of the focal company (Wiese and Toporowski, 2013 ; Zondag et al., 2017 ). Ciliberti et al. (2011)  stated that not every small and medium-sized focal company is in a position to force the implementation of CSR in its supply chains as some lack the necessary power. However, the supply chain environmental strategy implementation suffers strong pressures by external stakeholders (Betts et al., 2015 ).  5. Stakeholder Engagement.  The engagement involves actors such as the representative institutions, federal/state government, supply chain members and consumers. Harrison et al. (2010)  stated that there are different ways of involving counterparts: (i) strategizing based on network pictures in the absence of direct interaction, (ii) strategizing in the presence of a network audience, (iii) strategizing among deliberate equals, (iv) strategizing among imaginative equals, and (v) strategizing as an open and absorptive bystander. These ways of engagement are strategic for the promotion of sustainability, as highlighted in the surveys of Reuter et al. (2012)  and Zondag et al. (2017) . Morais and Silvestre (2018)  stated the importance of the stakeholder’s engagement for social sustainability. Brazil has a network of representative institutions that promote sustainable poultry farming, such as, for example, the Fundesa (Animal Health Development and Defense Fund) Institution, which organized the guide on Environmental Sustainability in Pork Production: Basic Recommendations (Fundesa, 2014 ), and CRMV-RS (Regional Council of Veterinary Medicine of the State of Rio Grande do Sul), which organized the Basic Guide to Technical Responsibility in Poultry Farms (CRMV, 2017 ). The government is a driving force for sustainable policies. The critical issue is government engagement. The challenges are the precise definition of policies, legislation, and technical/scientific support to promote sustainability (Vaccaro et al., 2010 , 2018 ; Bouzon et al., 2018 ; Larsen et al., 2018 ).  6. Frameworks to Implement SDGs.  The frameworks can be applied by business managers to harness sustainability principles and concepts in strategic planning and evaluation processes (Sullivan et al., 2018 ). It is important to offer practical operational tools for business managers such as customer order decoupling point (CODP) (Romsdal et al., 2014 ; Okongwu et al., 2016 ), push/pull processes, bullwhip effect (Chen et al., 2007 ; Persson and Araldi, 2009 ; Lee, 2010 ; Moori et al., 2011 ; Chen and Lee, 2012 ; Costantino et al., 2014 , 2015 ; de Almeida et al., 2015 ; Sterman and Dogan, 2015 ; Wang and Disney, 2015 ), system dynamics and system thinking (Senge, 2006 ; Cassel et al., 2009 ; Vaccaro et al., 2010 , 2018 ; Morandi et al., 2014 ; Sterman et al., 2015 ), seven basic tools of quality, and other industrial engineering concepts. There are empirical and theoretical/conceptual frameworks of SSCM practices (Seuring and Müller, 2008 ; Beske et al., 2014 ), supply chain vulnerability (Vlajic et al., 2012 ), supply chain network structure (Lambert and Cooper, 2000 ), stakeholder engagement (Chapman and Shigetomi, 2018 ), GSCM (Sellitto and Hermann, 2016 ; Miranda-Ackerman and Azzaro-Pantel, 2017 ; Miranda-Ackerman et al., 2017 ; Bouzon et al., 2018 ), supplier selection (Awasthi et al., 2018 ), performance (Cho et al., 2012 ; Balfaqih et al., 2016 ; Qorri et al., 2018 ), supply visibility (Saghiri et al., 2017 ), barriers and enablers (Kumar and Rahman, 2015 ), and others.  7. Education about SDGs and Public Participation.  The critical issues are public engagement (Li et al., 2018 ) and educational culture (Chin and Jacobsson, 2016 ; Scavarda et al., 2019a ) about a sustainable lifestyle (Chapman and Shigetomi, 2018 ). The challenges are teaching sustainable culture and changing the vision of the enterprise and communities.  8. Food Supply Chain Integrated System Forum.  The integrated system or vertical integration (NCC, 2012 ; Shamsuddoha, 2015 ) is a corporate strategizing approach that does not belong exclusively to the focal company. This integration faces critical management issues of various stakeholders by the focal company. The focal company should organize a forum to promote the knowledge exchange on CSR, SCR, managerial implications and collaboration.    These recommendations apply to any agro-industry that plays the role of a focal company and is interested in implementing SSCM in search of competitive advantage. Thus, this research is relevant given the growing formation trend of cooperatives and associations, considering that in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in the Southern Region of Brazil, there are 127 cooperatives in the agricultural sector (OCERGS, 2017 ). It is also worth remembering the relevance of the role of cooperativism in the face of the regulatory guidelines promoted by the European Union (Galli and Brunori, 2013 ). These findings apply to various types of food supply chains managed by the focal company such as milk, poultry, soybean, biodiesel, ethanol, peach, winemaking, and other chains.   4 Conclusions The achievement of SDGs requires changes in the transformation processes of food raw materials. These changes strongly impact on the agri-food chains because, in addition to being under the government agencies’ supervision, the agri-food chains are dependent on natural resources essential for the economic result of their operations. The focal company plays a strategic role in the vertical integration operation of the Brazilian poultry supply chain. The case study findings indicate the role of the focal company on the actors, including the feed mill supplier, live poultry transport, poultry processor, rendering plant, and distributor. However, there is a long road ahead before answering the question “how to be sustainable?“, especially in environmental and social issues involving all actors in the poultry supply chain. The case study analysis provides evidence of progress in implementing sustainable development orientation. However, the critical issues and challenges should be given special attention by the chain members, particularly because the consolidation of sustainable thinking in chicken importing countries may put pressure on the poultry supply chains to implement SDGs in chicken exporting countries such as Brazil. Such challenges are not implemented in the short term and should require government support. The case study findings indicated a concern with addressing legal issues, particularly environmental and sanitation issues. Brazilian environmental legislation still needs to be revised to be aligned with SDGs. In other words, to be aligned with the environmental legislation does not mean that the poultry supply chains are achieving SDGs, as shown in Table 3  and detailed in Table 2 . The vertical integration in the chicken industry has as a strong point in the integrated production through the technical assistance of the focal company in various chicken business processes. The research findings indicated that vertical integration is a type of supply chain governance with research opportunities for the implementation of sustainable approaches (corporate social responsibility, green supply chain management, industrial ecology, stakeholder theory, circular economy, and sustainability science), mainly in small and medium poultry supply chains. Collaboration and engagement are corporate strategizing approaches for the implementation of long-term actions in order to promote radical change in business models, supply chain responsibility, and a sustainable lifestyle. The partnership between governments, universities, representative institutions, and the private sector plays a strategic role in promoting SDGs, both in developed and developing countries, with the private sector playing a central role in this change due to the economic impact involved and, as a consequence, the production process transformation. This research has the following limitations. Generalization:  The observations made for other Brazilian poultry supply chains cannot be generalized. However, some data were from documents of representative institutions, in order to ensure a data triangulation and accuracy to present findings. Exploratory literature review:  The literature review was exploratory so that the sample of selected papers met the criteria described in Section 2 , that is, there may be a bias in the selection of papers. Focal company viewpoint:  The case study data were from an in-depth interview with a focal company member, that is, the viewpoint described in this research is of supply chain management by the focal company. The future studies are as follows: (i) comparative case studies between focal companies in poultry supply chains, (ii) comparative case studies between large poultry supply chains and small and medium-sized poultry supply chains, (iii) case studies with other stakeholders in the poultry supply chains, in addition to the focal company, (iv) identification of the main vulnerabilities that hinder the implementation of SDGs in poultry supply chains, and (v) analyses of the critical issues and challenges in using sustainable approaches.  Funding This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.   Declarations of competing interest None.
