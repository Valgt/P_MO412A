                  The concerns about climate change mitigation, decarbonization in critical sectors, and environmental pollution reduction have instigated a global surge in the use of renewables. As distributed energy resources (DER) proliferate, the existing power grid may be transformed into a carbon-free power system, ensuring that everyone has access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy. However, there are some practical impediments and challenges in the transition of the global energy system. Hence, the present study aims to examine the benefits, technological advancements, problems, and solutions for establishing a global sustainable green grid. This study also provides a comprehensive literature review of strategic research direction relating to energy transition in various sectors; identification of major issues and challenges in renewable power network; investment requirements in clean electricity generation; operational challenges of 100% renewable integration into the power grids; and power pool interconnection issues for building a renewable energy system on a global scale. Through reviewing several emerging low-carbon technologies, this article offers insights into the feasibility and sustainability assessment of transnational clean electricity networks for supplying power throughout the world. The findings of this study highlight the potential of adopting variable renewable energy (VRE) systems in the development of a global eco-friendly grid. It also confirms that solar PV systems on a global scale of 8519 gigawatts would reduce 4.9 Gt of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fulfill 25% of global electricity demand by 2050. The review affirms that intercontinental solar power infrastructure can ensure solar power supply to solar power deficient countries, allowing the world to move toward a sustainable and clean energy future. Finally, this work suggests future research opportunities for the global clean energy system.

The concerns about climate change mitigation, decarbonization in critical sectors, and environmental pollution reduction have instigated a global surge in the use of renewables. As distributed energy resources (DER) proliferate, the existing power grid may be transformed into a carbon-free power system, ensuring that everyone has access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy. However, there are some practical impediments and challenges in the transition of the global energy system. Hence, the present study aims to examine the benefits, technological advancements, problems, and solutions for establishing a global sustainable green grid. This study also provides a comprehensive literature review of strategic research direction relating to energy transition in various sectors; identification of major issues and challenges in renewable power network; investment requirements in clean electricity generation; operational challenges of 100% renewable integration into the power grids; and power pool interconnection issues for building a renewable energy system on a global scale. Through reviewing several emerging low-carbon technologies, this article offers insights into the feasibility and sustainability assessment of transnational clean electricity networks for supplying power throughout the world. The findings of this study highlight the potential of adopting variable renewable energy (VRE) systems in the development of a global eco-friendly grid. It also confirms that solar PV systems on a global scale of 8519 gigawatts would reduce 4.9 Gt of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fulfill 25% of global electricity demand by 2050. The review affirms that intercontinental solar power infrastructure can ensure solar power supply to solar power deficient countries, allowing the world to move toward a sustainable and clean energy future. Finally, this work suggests future research opportunities for the global clean energy system.

Renewables are the only form of low carbon energy and play a big role in the energy future. Solar and wind energy technologies compete with the traditional sources of electricity. These facts are pushing the whole world to shift into a sustainable and clean energy revolution to mitigate climate change [1] . Theoretically, all of humanity’s power needs can be met by solar power. Every 88 min, the sun emits 470 exajoules of energy to the earth’s surface, enough to power the entire planet for one year. In a couple of hours, the earth receives more energy from the sun than all of the energy used by mankind in a year [2] . However, in practice, the conversion rate of the energy capture and distribution is extremely inefficient. So the conversion rate could improve the efficiency of solar panels using advanced materials [3] . Although identifying solar resource-rich countries is a big challenge, historical solar data will help to identify ideal locations to set up solar projects. Due to the intermittent nature of solar energy, energy storage is employed to store the energy for future use. However, long-term storage batteries are not affordable. As a result, multi-season storage is required to store hydro, wind, and solar energy for later consumption during a peak time [4] . Another technical challenge is to reduce transmission and distribution losses for a sustainable energy future [5] . The green energy revolution provides abundant, reliable, and low-cost electricity, allowing for the transit of economies and saving lives from climate change. Clean energy from solar and wind has become decisively cheaper than fossil fuels. By 2050, renewable energy will supply nearly half of the world’s electricity, as the costs of wind, solar, and battery storage continue to plummet. However, creating and transporting clean energy is a challenge. Besides, a global clean electricity network is yet to be implemented [6,7] . Regarding the energy transition, rapid development and deployment of clean energy technologies are essential in achieving net-zero emissions [8] . A clean energy disruption by 2030 will herald the end of the current energy mix and the birth of cleaner power in every corner of the world. Solar energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles (EVs) are critical technologies that will disrupt all energy and transportation systems. However, the development of technology capable of capturing, storing, and exporting massive amounts of renewable energy has been difficult until now. The capacity to maintain a sufficient energy reserve over the long term when there is no wind or sunlight has historically been a concern for variable renewable energy sources, but the economics are changing in this sector [9] . In contrast to centralized power infrastructure, the proliferation of renewables allows end-users to generate their electricity, and in certain situations, surplus electricity may be transferred back to the grid. These areas are known as ‘microgrids’ [10] . A major concern is the regulation of this bidirectional power flow over massive transmission networks [11] . The patchwork technique is no more appropriate as more small generators join the network. One key aspect is to optimize the renewable sources, which are often located far from the final customer. Another difficult challenge is relocating the produced power onshore at a reasonable cost. Some electricity is lost during transmission as heat accumulates over long distances [12] . An additional benefit would be that renewables, if given transmission capacity, could power the dark side of the earth while the flipside is not sunshine. However, the cost of building this massive infrastructure would be enormous, and regulating it may require the involvement of several other international corporations [13] . From a technological perspective, it is completely feasible to power the entire world with renewable energy. The installation of long-distance transmission lines using HVDC submarine cables can help to transfer electricity over thousands of kilometers with minimal loss to the link between energy consumers and locations where renewable energy is most abundant [14] . In terms of technology advancement with HVDC in practice, global energy interconnection is feasible [15] . However, the electricity flow needs to be controlled precisely [16] . A crucial challenge is how to switch it from whenever it is most abundant and cheapest to wherever it is most needed with millisecond precision. The solution is “smart grids” that can control energy flows very precisely. So the combination of ultra-high voltage lines with smart grids and clean energy results in global energy interconnection [17] . If this vision is realized, it will be feasible to provide electricity across the world at any time of day or night. Electricity from solar hybrid mini-grids is still extremely expensive for many rural customers, and sectors suffer from a lack of investment [18] . A flexible, secure energy future should be a cost-effective, sustainable, and decarbonized energy system. Countries share their clean energy resources so that everyone gets a reliable supply of unlimited, cost-effective clean energy [19] . Considering global energy interconnection, each continent connects to a regional grid to trade renewable energy across borders [20] . Leaders in renewable energy can profit from interconnections and are frequently exporters [21] . This concept can provide greater energy security since it can import energy whether it is cloudy or windy. Although governments can only harness the massive potential, they require sufficient long-distance transmission lines to connect all the major consumption areas, cities, and factories with the greatest renewable energy locations. As a result, potential connections are being investigated all over the world [22] . Developing countries could quickly adopt the green grid concept, transforming the continent into a cutting-edge hub for renewable energy sharing and trade [23] . A mathematical model-based analysis for a 100% renewable power system is necessary for building the continental-scale grids and inter-regional grid connections [24–26] . This cross-border connectivity ensures universal access to modern energy and resolves the high cost of energy storage [27] . Due to a scarcity of critical reviews addressing knowledge gaps in research advancements pertaining to global clean energy systems, this review aims to present a comprehensive perspective on the sustainability and feasibility of global-scale renewable systems on the transcontinental grid while taking into consideration the nascent stages of contemporary technological breakthroughs. The following problems, issues, opportunities and developments for global renewable energy integration are addressed in this review paper: • Policy framing, infrastructure, restructuring power systems, energy supply, energy efficiency, and energy security are all challenges in the energy transition.  • The integration of 100% renewable energy encounters issues such as power balance, inverter, stability, protection, unintentional islanding, and black start.  • Technological, market and economic, policy, regulatory, political, and social impediments hamper solar PV implementation.  • Net load change, the effect of high renewable energy penetration, curtailment of renewable energy, and managing power system forecasting errors are major operational concerns in large-scale renewable integration.  • The prospects of global renewable energy integration include enabling technologies, business models, market design, and system operation.  • Deployment policies, integrating policies, and enabling policies are essential to achieve a sustainable energy transition.    The number of documents identified from SCOPUS database dealing with SDG 7 has varied greatly in recent years. However, the period from 2015 to 2022 has been the most fruitful, as seen in Fig. 1 .  According to the data in Fig. 2 , the majority of publications were in environmental science (24%), energy (16%), and social sciences (15%), accounting for more than half of total production.  The extreme conditions impact the analysis and statistics is presented in Fig. 3 . More than two-thirds (70%) of all published studies focused on extreme heat (33%), rainfall or flooding (20%), and drought (17%). According to the WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate, and Water Extremes, tropical cyclones accounted for 38%, while various types of floods accounted for 31% [28] .  This study will primarily focus on green and low-carbon transcontinental grid connectivity as a solution to future energy demands, dependable and affordable energy access, energy security and self-sufficiency, energy decarbonization, and climate change. Moreover, challenges and opportunities in greening the grid on a global scale are the key focus of the study. Furthermore, this article highlights the energy transformation to a future of low carbon electricity at a reduced cost, with the greatest benefit of building a global clean energy network by 2050. High RE penetration in an interconnected electricity network will eventually contribute to building a global clean energy system capable of meeting the estimated peak electricity demand by 2050. Table 1  summarizes this review using Cooper’s taxonomy 1 .  The rest of this study is organized as follows: Section 2  analyzes the importance of a global energy transition and highlights some key hurdles in various sectors from scenario analysis. Section 3  examines the necessity of a global energy transformation and highlights the challenges that have hindered achieving a 100% clean grid. The existing hindrances to accelerating solar PV deployment in the presence of contemporary technological solutions are investigated in Section 4 . Then, the operational implications of RE integration for attaining a global green grid are analyzed in Section 5 . Section 6  highlights the benefits, challenges, and roadmap of global renewable power grid connectivity. Finally, several unresolved scientific issues are addressed for future research to enable extensive solar PV deployment in various sectors, followed by some closing observations. Fig. 4  depicts the research flowchart of this investigation.    2 Global energy scenario and energy transformation rationale Due to unprecedented uncertainties in the energy sector, energy consumption will continue to increase. Meeting future energy demand and supply will be a significant problem. The evolution and modernization of the energy sector are incredibly complicated. The World Energy Council (WEC) has estimated the energy scenario for the year 2050 as shown in Table 2 .  This energy scenario focuses on achieving energy access, affordability, and supply quality by utilizing the greatest available energy sources, environmental sustainability, and energy security. Moreover, population, GDP growth, technology support, climate policy, resources, and efficiency are all quantified in these scenarios. Energy supply:  Global primary energy consumption (equal to supply) will rise by 27%–61%, and it will be difficult to satisfy global demands [29] . The energy supply problem does not have a global solution. Instead, each part of the problem must be solved separately to achieve the global goal of a sustainable, affordable, and secure energy supply for all consumers. Besides, global electricity production is expected to increase by 47.9–53.6 billion TWh by 2050 [30] . Energy efficiency:  Energy efficiency and conservation are critical in balancing demand and supply. Both involve a shift in client preferences and have cost implications across industries. As a result, capital is necessary to support energy-efficiency measures before they can pay off in terms of the initial investment [31] . The energy-mix:  Although fossil fuels will dominate the energy mix in 2050, renewable energy sources will increase at the fastest rate. The energy generation, including installed capacity and investment requirements, is presented in the Table 3 .  The rapid decline in renewable energy costs supports the energy transition. Based on auction outcomes and continued technological improvements, renewable energy costs are expected to be reduced more in the future. By 2030, the cost of solar PV is projected to have dropped by half again. Surprisingly, VRE accounted for more than half of the electricity generated in Germany’s eastern area. In addition, innovative solutions and life cycle thinking are required to meet the high energy needs of some power sectors, the excessive carbon emissions of some processes, and the high carbon content of certain products. In 2050, renewable energy will account for between 31% and 48% of total electricity generation [30] . 2.1 Energy transition in critical sectors: Integrating terawatts of clean energy resources into electric power systems can help to achieve decarbonization targets and combat global climate change. The reliability of integrating variable renewable generation will require electrification that will result in decarbonization in transportation, building, industry, and end-use sectors.  Therefore, renewable energy should be expanded to fulfill the demands for electricity, heat, and transportation [32] . The energy transition analysis and insights from important sectors are presented in Table 4 . Transport:  The transportation industry is currently dominated by fossil fuels, necessitating a significant shift. Although this industry contributes considerably to the electrification of passenger transportation, a cornerstone of the net-zero emission goal achievement of the transport sector is a hundred percent electrification. The net-zero goals hinge on solar deployment. By 2050, global liquid biofuel production will have surpassed 900 billion liters [33] . Another alternative is to use hydrogen as a transportation fuel for fuel cell cars. The transportation sector will require almost 14 trillion USD in total investment by 2050. The whole transportation sector is evolving as a result of modern energy resources combined with information and communication technology (ICT) [34] . Buildings:  The consumption of electricity in the buildings is anticipated to rise by 70% by 2050 requiring a cumulative investment of 38 trillion USD [35] . Energy-efficient buildings can be made with renewables to meet the electricity demand. Bioenergy will continue to be the most common renewable fuel in buildings. Due to the high share of renewable power in the electricity supply, the transition in cooking technologies and energy-efficient heat pumps will promote renewables in green buildings. According to IRENA’s report, the implementation of renewables in buildings would cost around USD 1.6 trillion and could meet over 56% of the sector’s energy consumption [36] . Industry:  The industrial sector is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It accounts for one-third of the global carbon emissions. Throughout the energy transition, biomass and renewable electricity will play an essential role in industries. By 2050, the industry must raise the renewable energy share in indirect applications and fuels to 48% [37] . Besides, hydrogen usage generated from renewables will increase to 7 EJ by 2050. Furthermore, the industrial sector has significant potential to increase its efficiency. According to the IRENA analysis, using the best available technology could reduce industrial energy consumption by nearly a quarter. Power:  End-use sector consumption will rise to approximately 42,000 TWh over the next three decades [30] . However, the power sector’s carbon intensity would be reduced by 85%. There should be no building of new coal-fired power plants and 95 percent of existing power plants should be decommissioned. In the power sector, the annual investment in green power production capacity is expected to rise to over USD 500 billion [30] . Moreover, decarbonizing the electrical grid will require an average of USD 1 trillion and renewable energy will provide over 85% of total power generation by 2050 [38] .  2.2 Investment needs in electricity generation: Although the energy revolution is certainly feasible and economically advantageous, it will need a significant increase in low-carbon technology investment over existing and planned policy. Table 5  shows the region-wise global energy generation, including investment requirements for the next three decades.  A further 27 trillion USD investment will be required during the term. Between 2021 and 2050, a total investment of nearly USD 120 trillion in low-carbon technology is needed averaging about 2.0 percent of global GDP every year [33] . However, the cost reductions far exceed the rise in energy system expenses. Reduction in air pollution and carbon-related environmental harm will result less spending on healthcare. Massive investments in power generation between 19 trillion and 26 trillion dollars are required globally to meet future electricity demand [39] . Solar PV, hydro-power, and wind power capacities are all huge investment needs. Solar PV, in particular, is expected to grow by 230 times in 2050 and generate power of approximately 2980 and 7740 TWh/y. As a result, solar PV generates a significant amount of electricity around the world [40] . Low-carbon electricity generation:  As a result of low-carbon energy generation, the global level of electrification will increase by more than 30% by 2050. Globally, electric power consumption per capita is anticipated to rise from 78% to 111%. However, the global economy would struggle to meet the 450 ppm target without a realistic carbon tax [41] . Energy-related CO  2    emissions:  WEC’s scenario show that CO  2     emissions will be between 19 and 44 billion tonnes per annum in 2050 [29] . Energy efficiency, together with renewable energy, is the main factor in lowering carbon emissions in the energy transformation. According to the government’s goals and policies, total emissions will surpass the carbon budget to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. By 2050, 470 Gt of emissions reductions will be necessary to keep global temperatures below 2 °C. Carbon emissions will increase each year until 2040, then decline somewhat by 2050 to nearly match the present levels. According to the IRENA study, widespread end-user electrification along with renewable energy and energy efficiency can account for more than 90% of emission reduction [35] . A low-carbon future requires renewable energy, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), and behavioral changes in consumers to mitigate the uncertainties in climate change [42] . The practical energy transformation solutions are summarized in Table 6 .  Thus, compromises and worldwide initiatives can help to balance energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability. Investments and regional integration are required for functioning energy markets. As a result, energy policy should ensure that the energy and carbon markets attract investment, foster regional integration, and supply electricity to all users. CC(U)S, solar, and wind, along with energy efficiency, will be the primary technologies driving change forward.   3 Challenges in global energy system transformation Global energy development would be more advantageous in terms of economic, social, and environmental benefits than the existing energy plans and policies of nations. At present, carbon emissions are not on track to fulfill Paris Agreement goals. The CO  2     emissions need to be reduced by 70%. Low-carbon technologies must be scaled up rapidly to keep global warming below 2 °C. In particular, development of renewables in the energy sector would be more advantageous in terms of economic, social, and environmental benefits than the existing energy plans and policies of nations. As a consequence, a decarbonized energy sector dominated by renewables is critical to achieving a greener and more sustainable energy future [43] . Climate goals and the energy transition are built on two main pillars: renewable energy and energy efficiency. These should be expanded considerably across all sectors. The power sector has advanced significantly in recent years. However, development in industry, transport, and the building sectors has to be accelerated with renewables. Besides, significant energy efficiency improvements in energy intensity are needed with renewable energy accounting for two-thirds of total energy consumption. According to IRENA, end-use sectors would account for 40% of the increase in power demand by 2050 and hence all nations will have to significantly increase the renewable energy share in their total energy needs. [29,33,35] . The main drivers of energy transformation are depicted in Fig. 5 .  Economically, the global energy transition makes sense. The financial system must be synchronized with sustainable development goals. Compared to present policies and planned ones, a massive investment in low-carbon technologies will be necessary to mitigate climate change. By 2050, the energy transformation would have resulted in 11 million new jobs in the energy market. The global average Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from renewables has also dropped by 77%. A reduction in net energy subsidies might help to reduce healthcare expenses with the growing usage of renewables. As a consequence, there is a payback of at least 3 USD for every dollar invested in restructuring the global energy system between now and 2050 [45] . With the surge in usage of renewables, carbon emissions might be reduced by 70% compared to present levels, resulting in a decline in the public health crisis caused by air pollution. The global renewable energy infrastructure will not only improve air quality but also increase energy security and energy access for all. The transformation of the global energy system would also result in enormous socioeconomic gains, which are critical in influencing any political decisions [46] . 3.1 Challenges in achieving a 100% clean grid The term ‘100% renewable energy system’ encompasses both variable and non-variable renewable energy sources. Hydro-power plants have been used for decades as non-variable renewable energy (NVRE). This power plant utilizes a synchronous machine to generate low-cost renewable energy. However, NVRE technologies are geographically limited. Operating power transmission networks with extremely high levels of variable renewable energy (solar and wind) is an alternative cost-effective solution [47] . The existing electricity network is dominated by synchronous generators with high rotational inertia and fewer inverter-interfaced VRE sources. However, VRE systems have been vigorously installed recently in countries like Denmark, Germany, and Ireland, with annual penetrations of over 20%. When large-scale VRE with many more inverter-based generators are integrated into power networks, the future grid will be more distributed. As the number of inverter-based devices increases, conventional synchronous generators will be replaced with power semiconductor-based generating stations, energy storage, and controllable loads. If the future grid had a significant VRE penetration (more than 50%) of the rated power at any point in time, the system would be an inverter-dominated grid, as depicted in Fig. 6  [48] .   3.1.1 The power balance challenge In the 100% RE system, multiple timescales are involved in balancing demand and supply, including the shortest timescales (seconds to minutes), the diurnal cycle (minutes-to-hours-to-days), and the seasonal time frame. The short-term variability problem:  The main challenges in solar PV systems are the late-afternoon net load ramps and the short-term fluctuations. More accurate predictions, shorter scheduling intervals, and wider balancing regions in system operations can all aid in the resolution of resource uncertainty issues [49] . The diurnal mismatch problem:  Power demand spikes 4 to 6 h after solar peaks, and wind tends to generate more power at night in many regions resulting in a diurnal mismatch. Due to the diurnal mismatch between demand patterns and VRE resources, the VRE capacity credit is limited and declining. The capacity credit is a measurement of a plant’s contribution to ensuring reliable service [50] . The mix of higher VRE penetration and limited capacity credit has prompted the reliability of power system operation during low net demand. The integration, power flow, scenario, and stability studies have been conducted to explore cost-effective solutions for the diurnal demand/supply imbalance problem, which include the following: (i) Shiftable load through responsive demand: Many electric vehicles are underutilized and unavailable during peak renewable production periods. Moreover, shifting new and current loads through responsive demand can alleviate the supply and demand mismatches. As a result, they may charge using low-value renewable energy or avoid charging during peak hours [51] . (ii) Transmission Network: Transmission improves access to potentially cost-effective renewable energy sources and minimizes net variability. However, installing a transmission network may be politically complicated in some countries. (iii) Diurnal storage: Cost-effective multiple energy storage devices with 4–8-hour capacity are becoming available. However, rising penetrations diminish the capacity’s marginal value. Despite Li-ion batteries having been widely deployed in recent years, other energy storage technologies typically have low marginal cost per unit. The electricity consumption from storage devices is often limited to specific locations. The diurnal storage could potentially be expensive for applications beyond 8–12 h [52] . (iv) Non-VRE: Regions with adequate resource quality and seasonal fluctuation are technically and economically viable for biomass, CSP with thermal storage, hydro, and geothermal technologies. (v) VRE overbuild: Cost-effective deployment of VRE generators can result in lowering the price of energy even with higher curtailment rates. For instance, with a curtailment rate of 33%, delivered energy from PV and wind resources would be competitive by 2050 at $10 and $8/MWh, respectively. According to studies, it is theoretically feasible to maintain supply/demand balance and appropriate operational reserves while dramatically increasing VRE deployment beyond 50% [53] . Thus, the diurnal mismatch issue might be solved cost-efficiently by prevailing technologies, providing yearly contributions of around 80% RE. The seasonal balance problem:  Wind, solar, and demand patterns have an enormous seasonal mismatch. Therefore, plant maintenance and outages are scheduled to ensure that electricity is available during high-demand periods. The seasonal mismatch in demand and supply is perhaps the most critical unresolved issue in addressing the balancing challenge at 100% RE. These issues include (1) An increase in the costs of RE deployment as a result of seasonal mismatches, (2) Seasonal balancing may need the use of technologies that have yet to be widely implemented, with uncertain costs and requirements, and (3) Reforms in the market design and policy are necessary to incentivize the proper resources [54] . Identifying renewables that can be accessible during extended periods of low solar production, biomass-fueled generators operating primarily as a capacity resource, and expanding the capacity of geothermal and hydropower generation during peak demand are all possible functions of peaking RE resources. Besides, Compressed air and hydro, power-to-gas technologies, and fuel cells are among the solutions for extremely long-term storage for solving the seasonal issue at 100% RE [55] . Although the challenges associated with the high renewable penetration in the power grid have been addressed, several solutions can provide the reliability needed to alleviate these issues. (i) Geographic diversity: When locating VRE generators, adequate geographic diversity is used to smooth total VRE power production. (ii) Expansion of transmission system: An expansion of the transmission infrastructure to transfer massive amounts of electricity more effectively from VRE power plants to load centers. Increased geographic variability of VRE generators and usage of transmission resources can be achieved by improved coordination across balancing authority regions and shorter interchange intervals. (iii) Shifting of VRE: Energy storage technology permits for the temporal shifting of VRE. This intra- and inter-daily power shifting may be accomplished using several storage technologies, including battery technologies, compressed air energy storage systems, and pumped hydropower fleet. (iv) Shifting of load demand: Demand-response technology can adjust load demand to match with VRE generation or reduce the remaining generating fleet’s ramping requirements. (v) Advanced RE and load forecasting: Advanced renewable energy and load forecasting are two other technologies that can help with the efficient utilization of flexible resources. As a result, minimizing the uncertainty in VRE output or load allows for more efficient use of the overall power system [56,57] .  3.1.2 The inverter challenge VRE systems that connect to the grid using power electronics converters are known as inverters. Inverters can control energy flow by manipulating semiconductor switching components in a shorter timeframe. Although wind energy systems employ several conversion stages before connecting to the grid, the inverter circuit is the focus since it interacts directly with the ac power system. Battery storage will play an essential role in controlling energy balance in high VRE systems. The inverter’s response is entirely dependent on the particular control approach. Hence, inverters are referred to as “zero inertia systems”. A closed-loop controller is necessary to govern power flow from the DC input, through the inverter, and finally to the AC grid, regardless of the VRE type. The combination of closed-loop controllers’ instant responsiveness at each VRE system and slower-action centralized controllers can precisely regulate the system frequency and bus voltages. The inverter-based generators in power networks may exceed 50% of the rated power at any instant, thereby forming an inverter-dominated grid [58] . Grid following and grid forming converters are included in inverter controllers. The most common grid-connected PV and wind inverter control method is grid-following controllers. Grid-following inverters act like a voltage-following current source in that it follows the grid voltage. Grid-forming inverters are capable of managing v/f through local decentralized control to overcome the limitation of grid-following inverters [59] . Grid-forming inverter controllers have the following characteristics: (i) Grid-forming units can function in the complete absence of synchronous machines to ensure that the infrastructure remains stable and reliable for the foreseeable future. (ii) Large collections of geographically distributed units necessitate decentralized techniques that do not rely on communications [60] . (iii) Inverter controllers must be interoperable with existing systems and allow for a smooth transition between designs as the system grows. They use advanced control methods in addition to power controls to ensure the quality of power supply to loads [61] . Droop-controlled inverters achieve these objectives by establishing a linear relationship between real as well as reactive power and frequency as well as voltage. Nevertheless, they are prone to a sluggish response during transients. Alternatively, researchers have investigated techniques of emulating certain physical phenomena with inverters to create virtual inertia. The inertial response of the machine is programmed on the inverter controller in this type of application [62] . Furthermore, nonlinear oscillator dynamics have recently garnered attention in grid-forming inverters. These novel virtual oscillator controllers have been proven to have fast reaction times and are capable of producing zero-inertia. According to the published road maps, extensive research and assessment will be required to verify that the 100% inverter-based grids may achieve the same degree of reliability as the present synchronous generators [63] . The following are some outstanding research topics: Grid-forming inverters:  Inverter controls with stored energy can emulate inertial response and provide rotor angle stability. However, this is not a concern in modern systems. More research is needed into inverter responsiveness to monitor and respond to frequency changes while preventing unintended tripping. To maximize their grid benefits, more study is needed to optimize the provision of services from inverter-based resources (IBRs), especially considering the many types of control used in grid-forming inverter variations. Grid-forming inverters have restricted overcurrent capabilities, resulting in lower system robustness. This may require the development of new inverter designs with overcurrent capabilities as well as new mechanisms to protect the system under fault circumstances. [64]  Modeling tools and capabilities:  Existing power-flow tools must be modified to measure and interpret grid conditions based on the physics-based response of inverters. Improving electromagnetic transient models for inverters and testing their responsiveness to grid disruptions are primary concerns. Understanding scale impacts:  As IBRs become more prevalent in the electricity system, each inverter uses a unique control strategy, resulting in unknown stability issues under various grid configurations. Therefore, more research into coordinated responses and potential interactions in IBR-based systems, such as harmonics, oscillations, and resonances, is required. Beyond frequency control:  The frequency control mechanism is incompatible with grids that are entirely based on IBRs. Therefore, the coordinated control method must be developed for 100% IBR-based systems, that not only to monitors and regulates power-sharing among multiple generators but also maintains supply–demand balance and grid stability during transitions.  3.1.3 The stability challenge Uncertain generation and fluctuating power demand levels are unpredictable in many power system conditions. Hence, an additional capacity known as “operational reserves” is made available throughout the dispatch process to maintain the frequency stability of the system during abrupt imbalances. Although wind and solar PV can provide any form of operational reserve, detailed resource forecasting across various periods is required to assure the availability of such reserves from VRE production. Furthermore, energy storage might be utilized to provide additional reserves and rectify imbalances caused by forecast inaccuracies [65] . Transient and small-signal stability:  The absence of synchronous generators in 100% renewable power systems reduces system inertia and has an impact on transient and small-signal stability. Inverter-based generators with suitable controller designs are essential to provide both active and reactive power regulation. They offer a synthetic inertia-like response and fault ride-through performance like traditional synchronous generators. As a result, the overall power system reliability has improved. Frequency stability:  At all times, the electrical frequency of an interconnected power system must be kept near its nominal value. Frequency fluctuations can cause instability, load shedding, equipment damage, and blackouts. In recent years, there has been rising concern in the electricity sector about the falling inertia and primary frequency response in interconnected networks. Because of the rising penetration of inverter-coupled generation, this reduction is expected to persist. Well-designed prediction-based hierarchical converter controllers for VRE can outperform traditional generators with primary, secondary, and tertiary control levels due to the fast response time of the power electronics interfaces. Voltage stability:  Maintaining nominal voltages on all buses in a power network is crucial for guaranteeing reliable energy supply across the transmission network. Volt/VAR management and resource optimization are thus critical for providing required voltage support while minimizing the impact on renewable generators’ capacity to produce active power.  3.1.4 Power system protection challenge With the absence of synchronous generators from the grid, additional issues arise relating to protection systems and coordination. During a fault scenario, inverter-dominated systems typically provide additional output current. One potential option is to employ inverters with pre-programmed fault current. They can detect malfunction and stop generating current within one-fourth of a cycle and can respond to grid disruptions incredibly fast and may be able to detach from the grid. Another method for eliminating overcurrent is to employ synchronous condensers to provide the grid with both fault current and inertia. More advanced overcurrent protection solutions for detecting and clearing faults should also be developed and deployed. Besides, the controllers in frequency relays can assess the frequency deviation and identify the fault on the grid [66] .  3.1.5 Unintentional islanding and black start As grids become more distributed in the future, some parts of the grid may become weaker and form electrical islands during faults. Communication-based active anti-islanding solutions will be required to achieve overall grid stability at low penetrations. Restarting a grid (black start) is critical to inverter-dominated system reliability. When the load is appropriately sized for its capabilities, synchronous generators will provide enough power to start electrical equipment with significant in-rush currents. Inverter-dominated systems must be capable of providing sufficient starting current [67] . In future, attaining 100% renewable electricity requires addressing supply–demand balance and inverter challenges, as summarized in Table 7 .  Thus, the research is desired to ensure that the RE supply matches demand patterns at all time scales. As the electricity network shifts from synchronous generated dominated to inverter dominated, new inverter designs are essential to enhance grid stability under contingencies. Besides, additional grid services are necessary to improve operational stability. Thus, maintaining supply–demand balance economically and designing inverter-dominated reliable grids in light of technological advancements can result in cost-optimal decarbonized energy systems.    4 Solar PV’s contribution to the global electricity system Solar power will play a crucial role in facilitating the transition to a carbon-free future. However, solar panel installation may be expensive upfront, and the permitting process might take some time. This is a practical barrier that the solar industry must overcome to succeed on a global scale. As solar panel technology advances, the price of photovoltaics falls dramatically resulting in a surge in solar installations for both residential and utility-scale use. As a consequence, the price of solar energy has dropped from one of the most expensive to one of the most affordable. Although solar panels often generate excess electricity on most days, storing that energy for later use is not always a cost-effective solution. Thus, consumers typically rely on nonrenewable energy sources at night [68] . Utility-scale:  Large-scale solar power plants that generate hundreds of megawatts of electricity and feed it into the grid are becoming the most cost-effective size for utility-scale operations [45] . However, it may be hard to find suitable land and transmission capacity. Several mid-size utility-scale installations are located closer to the load. As a result, utility-scale projects are essential for creating a diverse range of solar power options for different consumers. Energy storage:  However, these utility-scale plants cannot achieve their full potential without energy storage. Solar farms are capable of providing electricity on demand, not only when the sun is shining but also to compete with the reliability of fossil fuels. Lithium-ion batteries have traditionally been used for storage. Fortunately, the price of this technology is plummeting alongside the cost of solar panels. Both solar energy and battery storage systems are less expensive than a natural gas contract. However, lithium-ion batteries may not be considerably cheaper. Many experts predict that costs will eventually fall to approximately $70-$100 per kilowatt-hour. At current prices, Batteries will continue to be an affordable alternative for smoothing out hours-long gaps in solar production. However, they will not be a suitable choice for storing energy for weeks or months at a time, as this would massively increase consumers’ electricity prices. Even though lithium-ion has made significant advances in technology, the way forward is to strive for even greater improvements. Researchers have recently been investigating flow batteries, which are liquid nickel-metal hydride batteries [69] . It is possible to operate a renewable-only system when roughly 20% of peak demand is available in storage devices. As prices drop and solar installation continues to rise, incentives and regulations encourage solar plant expansion. 4.1 Global solar power grid Diverse geopolitical, market integration, and techno-economic considerations promote the need for higher voltage systems to be networked across nations and continents. Potential areas for renewable energy generation are scattered unevenly across the continent or around the world. Remote places have a high concentration of renewable energy potential. Local weather patterns also have a significant impact on renewable energy output. To efficiently utilize these resources, the existing power infrastructure must be improved to allow electricity to be transported to critical demand and storage centers. A more robust and flexible transmission system may be desirable for connecting distant power markets and leveraging the geographical and temporal complementary of low-carbon resources [70] . 4.1.1 Global solar grid model In general, if a power outage happens in one nation, the abrupt change in bus voltage and electric network frequency in the global grid could trigger a solar power generator in another country to compensate for the electricity shortfall. In this way, the global electricity grid concept ensures that all generated power must be consumed [22] . On the contrary, storing surplus energy would also prevent this issue. However, large-scale cost-effective energy storage is presently scarce. To optimize the utilization of available solar power generation capacity to meet global power demand, satellites are employed as a backup platform for data and communication exchange across electrical grids all over the world, as shown in Fig. 7 .  Satellite-based global grid power management can help with operations and maintenance while ensuring global grid stability.  4.1.2 HVDC link All of the above factors may contribute to the development of a transcontinental high-capacity transmission system capable of transporting massive amounts of electricity over thousands of kilometers [71] . High voltage direct current (HVDC) technologies have the potential to be the foundations of such a global power system due to their lower losses and environmental effects. Bulk electricity export needs substantial reactive power support and a reliable link to the local grid. These criteria create a significant technological challenge in nations lacking a strong domestic power support infrastructure. Amid challenges in connectivity between power grids, HVDC technology allows energy operators to transfer power between grids and balance generation and consumption throughout the globe. A total of 100,000 km of HVDC power cable and 115 converter stations are required to build the global solar power grid. Therefore, high-capacity transmission lines need to be built to ease the exchange of more power across continents, as shown in Fig. 7  [72] . Due to the proliferation of carbon-free grids and the transfer of enormous amounts of power over great distances without substantial losses, high-rated 330MW HVDC converters with 1% conversion losses are installed at either end of the cable. SiC and GaN-based switching devices have recently been introduced for HVDC converters to reduce costs while increasing functionality [62] . Large-capacity circuit breakers with a short-circuit current of more than 60 kA should be developed for the HVDC transmission system to respond in milliseconds to detect faults. According to recent research, the superconducting cable can handle significantly higher voltage and power ratings with virtually no transmission losses, effectively replacing traditional copper or aluminum cable [73] . However, compared to conventional materials, these cables are more expensive. The feasibility and sustainability of an intercontinental green energy corridor that aims to synchronize the electricity produced by solar panels with conventional power stations on neighboring continents are being examined. An Ultra HVDC link in the voltage range of 800-1100-kV with a capacity of 3000–6400 MW is further required as a standardized system for the construction and integration of power transmission grids throughout the world. The techno-economic challenges for electricity trading through a submarine power cable should be investigated for the transcontinental electricity networks.  4.1.3 Satellite communication An essential requirement for optimizing power flow between continents and successful power trading in energy markets is a high-speed communication service. Satellite communication is capable of managing solar grid operations in a dynamic environment and interactions with the world’s main transcontinental grids with minimal latency. Using satellite time synchronization, the energy management system (EMS) at an electric utility control center manages the operations of the high voltage DC transmission grid to ensure that electricity is supplied to all continents at all times [74] . Grid conditions are monitored every few seconds at the EMS, and undesired circumstances are detected and communicated. Grid measurements must be visualized in real-time for successful grid operations. These real-time measurements have intelligently transformed into actionable information.   4.2 The future of solar photovoltaic system A global solar electricity network is an ecosystem of interconnected renewable energy resources that are shared smoothly for global sustainability. This initiative aims to connect 200 countries through a common grid that will be used to transfer solar power. The sun is always present in some geographical regions, notwithstanding the motto “the sun never sets”. The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was initiated in 2015 to meet climate change mitigation goals through “solarisation of the world”. This launch aims to interconnect different regions, such as South-East Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and other grids in the world to ensure steady and uninterrupted energy generation and transmission. ISA envisaged 121 sunny countries situated either completely or partly between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn as its members as shown in Fig. 7 . For this initiative, ISA is trying to help some member nations to install solar power. One of its initiatives is to deliver 1,000 GW of solar electricity to 1,000 million people by 2030 with a $1 billion investment [75] . In recent years, the solar PV industry has seen substantial growth with major milestones in cost reductions, off-grid installations, technology improvements, and the formation of solar energy organizations. Solar PV capacity expansions in leading countries have become more cost-effective due to R&D investment, deployment, and other government policies. As a result, solar photovoltaics will be one of the most rapidly expanding, mature, and cost-competitive renewable energy technology in the next decades. The estimations of solar PV deployment to meet Paris climate goals are shown in Table 8 .  Solar PV plants with a capacity of more than 8500 GW would be able to satisfy more than 25% of worldwide energy consumption by 2050. This power generation would minimize CO  2     emissions by 4.9 Gt, accounting for 21% of total emissions reductions in the energy sector. In 2030 and 2050, solar PV installations are expected to reach 2840 GW and 8519 GW, with annual solar PV additions of 270 GW and 372 GW, and the solar power share of global electricity generation to account for 13% and 25%, while installation costs fall to USD 834-340 per kW and USD 481–165 per kW, respectively. The dropping cost of technology has a significant impact on solar PV investment. Total expenditure of around USD 6.4 trillion and an annual investment of 192 billion per year will require for installing 8519 GW of solar PV as shown in Fig. 8 .  In terms of solar PV installations, Asia is anticipated to outperform the rest of the world, followed by North America and Europe. For a sustainable energy future, solar energy can meet a large part of the challenge of climate change, help displaces fossil fuels, and reduce carbon emissions [76] .  4.3 Innovations and technological solutions As the percentage of solar power approaches high levels in energy markets at the lowest cost, the fluctuating nature of solar resources will require significant modifications in the power system’s operation. Adequate steps will be needed to guarantee the stability and reliability of the grid. Considering seasonal fluctuations in solar and wind power generation, changes to grid operation and management will be necessary on a minute-by-minute basis. According to IRENA, additional investments in transmission and distribution power systems, adequate power generation capacity, and flexibility mechanisms (such as storage) across the whole electrical network, amounting to USD 13 trillion by 2050 will be necessary to incorporate increased shares of variable renewable resources [39] . Batteries need to be integrated to ensure adequacy and flexibility in VRE systems. This comprises decentralized power generation with extra pumped hydropower capacity and battery storage, specialized utility-scale batteries, and EV batteries to support the grid via vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. An estimated 14 TWh of electric vehicle batteries could be available to provide grid services [77] . Hydrogen is undoubtedly one of the developing technologies that have the potential to improve power system flexibility by functioning as seasonal storage and allowing high shares of variable renewables to be integrated. In total final energy consumption, there may be a worldwide economic potential for 19 EJ of hydrogen produced from clean energy. This would imply that by 2050, hydrogen production would account for 5% of total electricity consumption and 16% of total power production [78,79] . Incorporating a significant proportion of VRE into the power network, innovation is essential in all segments of the power sector. The optimal method for absorbing more VRE differs by country and environment. Solutions arising from the synergy between developments in all parts of the system would enable the creation of reliable and cost-effective power systems based on renewable energy. These developments offer a better solution that may be optimized to cut costs while enhancing system benefits. The innovation landscape for integrating high shares of VRE is presented in Fig. 9 .  Enabling technologies such as battery storage, demand-side management, and digital technology are revolutionizing the power industry and paving the way for new applications that effectively improve flexibility. As a new market for renewables, end-use electrification is gaining traction. Innovative business models are essential for monetizing the additional value provided by these technologies. Numerous creative business models at the consumer level and innovative plans enable renewable energy distribution in off-grid or heavily inhabited areas. As the globe changes toward low-carbon power systems with large VRE shares, adapting market strategy to the evolving paradigm is critical for permitting value creation and suitable revenue streams. In addition, improvements in system operation are necessary with emerging technologies and sound market design in place. These developments include innovations that embrace uncertainty and novel system methods for incorporating DER [81] . 4.3.1 Barriers and solutions to fostering solar PV deployment The existing barriers at multiple levels, including technological, policy, economic, regulatory, and sociopolitical, may cause a slump in solar PV capacity expansion over the next three decades. It is essential to immediately mitigate these hurdles through several support policies and implementation approaches for boosting future deployment. To achieve a sustainable energy transition, deployment policies, integrating policies, and enabling policies must work together to eliminate the existing barriers [75,82] . Deployment policies:  Long-term capacity mechanisms, support schemes, and adaptable policies are necessary to drive investment in solar PV technologies in response to changing market conditions. Renewable energy auctions are also employed to meet policy goals such as ensuring project completion on schedule, expanding solar PV capacity, and enabling a sustainable energy transition. For decarbonizing electricity generation, cost-effective PV deployment solutions are employed. Furthermore, renewable energy regulations help to overcome the challenges associated with increasing renewable energy investments. Third-party-owned pricing structures need to be created to promote residential solar PV growth. Through these models, consumers can invest in solar PV technology by acquiring or leasing a portion of a shared solar system. Companies should be permitted to further produce corporate renewable electricity for self-consumption and purchase options with energy suppliers so as to encourage corporate direct investment in solar PV installations [83] . Integrating policies  The distributed energy resources at the consumer level should be deployed as roof-mounted solar PV, distributed energy storage, demand response, plug-in EVs, power-to-hydrogen, and power-to-heat systems, and should be supported by advanced digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, and big data mechanisms, and should be able to participate in wholesale electricity markets. Despite the unpredictability of solar PV generation, high voltage networks must be designed with an advanced weather forecasting system to generate and transmit power. They also strengthen the grid interconnections between countries, enhance energy access rates with renewable sources, and avoid renewable energy curtailment. To achieve rapid growth in future investment in solar PV deployment, the adverse social impacts that may occur during planning, construction, and operation and maintenance must be identified, examined, and mitigated well in advance. For maintaining the stability of investors and other stakeholders, installer training programs are needed to ensure the quality of solar PV installations. Community-based sustainable initiatives must also be incorporated from the beginning phases of solar PV development, operation, and equitable distribution. In future, PV systems can be included in the construction of new buildings to maximize installation space [84] . Enabling policies  A transformation in enabling policies should drive the power industry to the forefront of the economy by promoting R&D funding in both public and private sectors and consumer awareness. Public investment should be targeted to stimulate the use of renewables, foster competitive conditions with lower energy prices, and create new jobs. Budgets should be reallocated and recycled to support universal healthcare, education, and other areas. Carbon tax revenue might be utilized for more job opportunities and alleviate the additional expenses on low-income households and small enterprises. Furthermore, technical development and training may equip the workforce with the essential skills while also assisting workers in reskilling from the petroleum industry to renewables, hence increasing local employment prospects [85] . In summary, existing impediments and potential solutions to expedite solar PV deployment are summarized in Table 9   Hence, total solar PV capacity is predicted to reach over 8519 GW globally by 2050, with capacity additions of 372 GW per year and an annual average investment of USD 192 billion per year. This would meet 25% of total power demands, making it a prominent generation source with an LCOE account of between USD 0.014 and 0.05/kWh. Among all low-carbon technological options, solar PV has the greatest potential to cut emissions by 4.9 Gt CO  2     in 2050 which accounts for 21% of carbon mitigation in the power sector. Competitive solar PV prizing and innovative business models are enabling the system price reductions. With sound policies, the transition can offer socio-economic benefits. As a result, harnessing the immense potential of solar PV is critical for meeting climate goals.    5 Greening the grid: Pathways to integrate RE into the electrical grid For the transnational power system, VRE is expected to rise dramatically. According to the energy scenario, the world should achieve a global target of 8200 GW in installing renewable energy capacity by 2050 including 4439 GW of solar and 1654 GW of wind. Wind and solar energy can be incorporated into the grid at low levels successfully. However, they might pose some challenges to grid operations at higher levels due to the uncertainty of renewables [86] . The focus of this section is to assess strategies and operational challenges for high-RE systems. Furthermore, this section investigates the operational implications of attaining global RE targets and the steps required to integrate cost-effective VRE generation. 5.1 The global power system with high levels of RE at least cost Forecasting strategies have been utilized for controlling demand variability and allowing the power system to operate efficiently. High-resolution meteorological data is used to capture the time- and location-specific characteristics of VRE generation. Using precise grid representations and RE inputs, the optimum scheduling and dispatch of available power reduce the overall production costs subject to physical, operational, and market constraints [87] . 5.1.1 Capacity and location of the wind and solar As weather determines the patterns and timing of VRE generation, it is impossible to predict the impacts of weather forecasting on load, wind, and solar generation at 15-minute time intervals for the whole year. Therefore, the typical approach is to base the future-year analysis on historical weather data. RE day-ahead forecasts will be used to make unit commitment decisions. RE forecasts are intended to be as precise as day-ahead forecasts in real life. With the knowledge of average wind speed and worldwide horizontal irradiation of the sun, a geospatial site suitability study with capacity estimation for utility-scale RE has been carried out. The best potential project sites have been identified from an existing RE pooling substation to locate suitable project sites. Several utility-scale solar, rooftop solar, and wind capacity expansions must be planned globally to achieve the global RE capacity targets [88] .  5.1.2 Accessible transmission network The Green Energy Corridor Project intends to synchronize VRE-generated electricity with conventional power plants in the grid. The power flow limits on transnational networks are estimated for the global study using total surge impedance loading limits. The linearized DC optimum power flow technique is used to compute power flows across continents [89] .  5.1.3 The electricity demand According to the World Energy Council, global power demand is expected to reach 193–244 petawatt hours (PWh) by 2050 [29] . The production cost model entails the simulation of a time series of loads at 15-minute intervals for the whole year 2050 based on the historical data for all countries. With an annual RE curtailment of 1.4 percent, this VRE capacity (4439 GW of solar and 1654 GW of wind) will meet 25% of the global power demand by 2050.   5.2 Operational impacts of 8200 GW RE The annual energy flow on key corridors does not vary considerably, even though corridors usually transport electricity in both directions. Wind and solar energy contribute to overall generation. According to WES, the 6093 GW of solar and wind can generate 11.74 PWh of electricity annually resulting in a 25% penetration level of VRE (16.5% from solar and 8.5% from the wind). 5.2.1 Net load change Steeper load ramps and lower overall generation levels during a period of high RE penetration are characterized as ‘Netload’. The generator delivering the aggregate net load must be more flexible. Netload analysis can help in identifying periods that may be operationally challenging due to uncertain renewable profiles. To normalize the hourly net load ramps, the non-renewable capacity of all units is committed during the ramping period [90] .  5.2.2 The effect of high RE penetrations on thermal power plant operations The 6093 GW of solar and wind energy will displace 7.3 PWh of coal, representing an 84% decrease. Because of the reduction in coal generation, total annual CO  2     emissions will reach 19.1 Gt. As a consequence, CO  2     falls by 70% compared to the current level in the world energy scenario.  5.2.3 Impact of RE on exports and transnational power flows Interstate energy exchange will decline in line with the trend of falling international imports and exports. However, with VRE, transnational energy interchange will become more common. The installation of 6093 GW VRE affects energy trade across continents. When compared to other nations, RE-rich countries have a huge volume of low variable-cost generation. Furthermore, the unpredictability of netload on a daily and hourly basis rises, increasing the importance of renewable energy interchange for balancing demand and generation across countries. In many instances, using the transmission system to transmit electricity to locations with higher-cost energy is the best option [91] .  5.2.4 Curtailment of RE due to a variety of factors RE curtailment can occur for several reasons, depending on the model objective of serving load at the lowest possible cost while complying with the system’s physical and economic limits. The major factors in RE curtailment are transmission congestion, thermal and hydro inflexibility, start and stop costs, and trade barriers. To overcome this difficulty, experts employ a modeling technique called hurdle rates. A country with low-cost electricity generation can export energy to nearby countries if the difference is greater than the hurdle rate [92] .  5.2.5 Managing the power system forecasting errors When actual VRE generation varies from predicted generation, this is referred to as a forecasting error. Forecasting errors disrupt dispatch operations and force the power system to operate in real-time with limited resources to optimize electricity supply and demand. Underforecasting occurs when predicted generation is less than actual RE generation, whereas over-forecasting occurs when forecasted generation exceeds actual RE generation. Certain periods may cause reliability issues in a highly constrained system due to forecast errors. The planned generation fleet has sufficient capacity to manage RE forecast errors, fluctuations in net load (ramps), and low RE generation times of day and year. The reserve needs may benefit from being different according to the season or time of the day [93] . As a whole, the following strategies will significantly improve RE integration: • The copper plate sensitivity is a representation of the projected transmission needs for the lowest-cost generator dispatch which results in peak power transfer and loop flows. It minimizes RE curtailment and production costs.  • Batteries can aid in the reduction of RE curtailment. However, due to inefficiencies, they have an insignificant impact on total generation costs and emissions.  • Operating large thermal plants at minimum generating levels is a key driver of RE curtailment reduction. Besides, changes in operational practice can reduce the power system’s operational costs and minimize RE curtailment.  • If all renewable power plants utilize their inherent ramping capability, the ramp rate can be fulfilled.  • Hydroelectric generation’s intrinsic flexibility helps to keep the system balanced.    Thus, power system balancing using VRE is possible with few integration issues, resulting in lower GHG emissions. Attaining present regulatory requirements for carbon flexibility, extending geographic and electrical balancing regions, expanding power transmission in important locations, and planning for future adaptability can enable the power system to operate efficiently and reliably in the future.    6 Global grid connectivity: Benefits, strategies, barriers, and challenges The requirements for sustainable power provisions are energy transitions to low-carbon technologies, cost reductions in renewables, advancements in high-voltage transmission, and smart grid management. Although grid interconnection with renewable energy enables economic, environmental, and technical benefits, cross-border connectivity is fraught with difficulties in the areas of regulations, policies, standards, investment, energy security, information sharing, electricity trade, and technical and political factors [94] . 6.1 Benefits in global power grid connectivity Countries have a variety of energy resources, political systems, and market frameworks in place to enhance the environmental impacts of development, economic expansion, and energy security.  The advantages of regional interconnected power networks are summarized in Fig. 10 . 6.1.1 Environmental benefits The Asia-Pacific region has diversified renewable energy resources, generation mixes, load profiles, and weather patterns. For instance, 750 GW of solar electricity from India, 240 GW of hydropower from ASEN, 32 GW of geothermal energy from Indonesia, 410 GW of wind energy, and 1150 GW of hydropower from South and South-West Asia are expected to satisfy the future power needs. Power export is enabled through cross-border power connectivity, which requires significant infrastructure support to increase the renewable energy share. Optimizing the energy mix and cross-border power trading can help to improve energy security by alleviating shortages and enhancing renewable energy access [96] .  6.1.2 Technical and economical benefits VRE cannot be scheduled to match instantaneous power demand due to its intermittency. Amid the development of renewables, the integration of non-dispatchable RE into power systems and compensation for stochastic fluctuations are two interrelated issues that need to be resolved to enhance reliable power supply. The output of VRE can be controllable to match the supply and demand across different timescales (minutes, days, and seasons). Transnational grid connectivity can enhance reliable electricity supply and minimize the economic value of renewable power curtailment. Robust grid connectivity and transnational electricity trade enable the least-cost power dispatch from generating units and ensure overall cost savings. Connected nations benefit from regional electricity trading and ancillary services. If one of the distributed generators fails, the spinning reserve refers to the generation capacity that is maintained in reserve yet prepared to respond immediately. Load diversification via interconnectivity greatly smoothes the entire network load profile. The reduced imbalances minimize the requirement for instant frequency responses and enable the distribution of spinning reserves among a broader range of customers lowering the service cost [97] .  6.1.3 Energy security Managing energy security concerns such as energy accessibility, self-sufficiency, supply dependability, demand and supply diversity, power continuity, price stability, and environmental effects necessitates the use of national and regional solutions. Besides, a more diversified generation mix enhances reliability by limiting supply outages. Higher diversity from geographic dispersion provides more security for renewable energy fluctuations. Sustainable energy development is also made possible via cross-border connectivity [98] .   6.2 Challenges and barriers in global power grid connectivity With environmental, social, economic, and energy security concerns, cross-border electricity trade necessarily requires infrastructure development, technical and regulatory standards harmonization, policy coordination, and information and data exchange, as seen in Fig. 11 .   6.2.1 Policy, regulation and standards Each country has its own set of power transmission regulations, standards, and grid codes. Diverse frameworks may impede the technical and financial coordination for cross-border connectivity. Therefore, gaps in standards, regulations, and policies must be identified and rectified through extensive analysis of the interconnected transnational electricity network [101] . Planning and coordination:  Transmission network infrastructure planning should be coordinated across nations, including technical specifications, financing, and scheduling in months or years. Trade agreement:  An integrated electricity market requires agreements on transmission service, power purchase, and secured payment mechanisms. Moreover, balanced, competitive, and transparent power markets with fair prizing procedures must be established for the electricity trade. Costs, benefits, and risk:  Develop methods for allocating costs, benefits, and risks between member nations. Consumer protection:  To appropriately distribute the benefits, a consumer protection policy must be devised and linked between protected customers and constituent nations. Technical regulations and standards harmonization:  For effective implementation of connectivity, energy producers, utilities, and system operators should harmonize international technical regulations and standards including alignment of metering codes, voltage, frequency, thermal limits, protection schemes, and ICT systems [102] .  6.2.2 Technical factors Technical standards like frequency and voltage, grid codes, and protective schemes are synchronized. Furthermore, data is shared promptly across member nations [103] . Alignment of standards and codes:  Although the standards of frequencies may differ in member nations, frequency alignment (50/60 Hz) of the interconnected transmission system can be achieved to ensure interoperability or compatibility through either harmonization or conversion technique. Strong electricity grid:  Importing and exporting bulk electricity requires a robust transmission system with reactive power support, fault ride-through capabilities, contingency reserves, and system inertia. Data sharing:  Although certain countries have successfully adopted the smart grid, hybrid VRE power, and energy-saving projects, data is not managed globally. Intergovernmental organizations must maintain the member countries’ available power sector information and update it regularly.  6.2.3 Political factors Political instability, lack of trust and desire to collaborate among countries, and energy security concerns are major impediments in implementing regional interconnection initiatives [104] . Energy security:  In an interconnected transmission network, technical faults or disruptions in one nation’s grid cause grid failure in another country. Controlling the voltage and power flow in high-voltage DC transmission can alleviate this risk. Internal disagreements:  Low-cost renewable resources can be exported to countries with fewer renewable sources or retained for future domestic energy needs. However, large-scale energy storage is currently sparse. Estimates of the future energy demand and pricing result in varying weightings of the cost–benefit of energy trading. Entrenched domestic interests:  Regardless of the potential economic benefit of energy trading, politically powerful utilities may perceive an interconnection proposal as undermining their economic standing. Because of the risk of losing market share, power revenues, or strategic position, these organizations are likely to oppose grid interconnections across borders. Motivation for transit nation:  In many circumstances, electrical connectivity is not always confined to neighboring nations. Third-party nations may participate as “transit countries”, offering right-of-way for transmission lines but not importing or exporting power. Due to a lack of political support, these partners do not perceive enough benefits from the initiative. Deficits in trust:  Because of a lack of trust among nations, there may be an absence of public and political support for power connectivity proposals to increase reliance on neighboring countries for substantial components of energy demands. However, with the successful integration of power networks in other parts of the globe, connectivity may be a helpful instrument for establishing trust and relationships among nations that expand to other regions of cooperation. Decision-making at the highest levels:  High-level decision-making on cross-border power connections is more challenging than many other difficulties, resulting in extended deadlines and project stalling. Curbs in investment:  Several nations have relaxed restrictions on foreign direct investment in electricity generation. However, investment in the transmission network is restricted to state-owned firms for expanding domestic transmission line. The overall economic situation of some countries makes obtaining competitive funding even more difficult because of uncertain payback mechanisms, contract law, resolving disputes, delays in financial closure, currency volatility, unfair taxes, and government interventions.  6.2.4 Project development Beyond the technical, political, and investment considerations mentioned above, the green energy corridor project poses implementation challenges related to land acquisition and environmental clearance [105] . Land acquisition:  With the influence on development timeframes, the framework, procedures, and expenses for acquiring land in nations may need to be accounted for in the project’s cost–benefit analysis. Environmental clearances, resettlement, and rehabilitation:  In some nations, obtaining environmental permission, rehabilitation, and resettlement may be challenging. Before acquiring land for large-scale renewable deployment, social impact analyses may be required to determine the type of interest. Rehabilitation and resettlement might be significant in terms of the overall project budget.   6.3 Strategies of global grid connectivity The roadmap for regional power system interconnection is presented in Fig. 12  for attaining the aim of SDG 7 to ensure reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy supply.  Trust and political consensus:  Geopolitical problems and a lack of trust among many nations are critical impediments in strengthening cross-border connectivity and creating power trade. As a result, multinational corporations must make concerted action plans for integrated electricity networks on a global scale. Rebuilding trust for transcontinental power infrastructure should be sought by all nations, regardless of energy trade. This strategy is essential to raise awareness of the benefits across all segments of society and obtain support for the cross-border connectivity process [107] . Regional masterplan:  Grid interconnection in some locations functions on a bilateral basis and is restricted in scope. To improve the connection for all locations throughout the world, it is essential to design and agree on a power network masterplan for the region’s grid connectivity. The grid master plan should be created by the inclusion principle, considering stakeholders’ concerns and demands [108] . Intergovernmental agreements:  Multinational experiences of successful power pools exemplify the need for contracts among member nations to demonstrate each country’s political commitment to fostering energy cooperation and integration within a defined time frame. If agreements are already in existence, member nations must ratify them and hasten their implementation [109] . Regulatory frameworks and harmonize policy:  Policies, grid codes, standards, and regulations for electrical grids vary from country to country. It is critical to identify such gaps in each subregion through in-depth research and studies. Transparent and seamless electricity transactions necessitate a well-integrated market. Regulators in each subregion should create forums to facilitate regulatory harmonization, capacity-building, and information exchange. The electricity industry is to be tightly regulated to achieve grid stability. Synchronizing policies, regulations, and standards for intercontinental electricity trading are crucial [110] . Multilateral trade and competitive market:  Shifting from bilateral to multilateral electricity trading is difficult in both countries. Moving this to a multilateral approach will assist nations in optimizing total regional power supplies, boosting economic growth, expanding renewable electricity generation, strengthening reliability, lowering prices, and contributing to the environmental sustainability of the power market. Furthermore, establishing attractive and transparent power purchase mechanisms with security procedures for a transit charge system for member nations will assist in accelerating cross-border connectivity and trade [111] . Transmission planning and operation:  Transmission lines must be physically interconnected to allow electricity to be sent between several national grid networks. Grid codes such as metering codes, frequency and voltage standards, protection schemes, and thermal limitations must be harmonized to link two separate national power systems. To ensure a safe and reliable power flow, member nations and the technical institutions in each subregion must coordinate transmission planning, scheduling, metering connection, and protection schemes. Utility companies should design and build suitable power lines for energy transmission to support the cross-border connectivity projects, allowing developers unrestricted access to electricity [112] . Mobilize investment:  Mobilizing investment is a challenge in the electricity sector since it is capital intensive with high risks and extended gestation periods. Most of the funding for cross-border electricity projects comes from IFIs, multinational banks, and state contributions. Therefore, it is critical to have investment-friendly regulations, standards, and frameworks to attract investment. These include removing impediments in the private sector and international investment, facilitating the land acquisition, relocation and resettlement processes, and obtaining planning permission [110] . Capacity building:  Some nations have successfully implemented green power projects, smart grid initiatives, and energy efficiency projects. However, they have only limited capability for exchanging information and best practices through capacity-building. Intergovernmental organizations, multilateral financial institutions, and power utilities should develop capacity-building plans and share information. Leveraging expertise in new technologies, EV charging infrastructure, smart grid activities, massive solar power production, energy efficiency, and competitive bidding will enable to implement in all member countries [113] .  6.4 Affordable and clean energy Aspects of achieving SDG 7 from the perspective of energy access, including photovoltaic systems, wind farms, hydropower, lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicles, biodiesel, hydrogen fuel, microgrid, smart grid, energy efficiency, and internet of things, are taken into consideration [114–126] . The smart concepts of a planning tool, brown box, inertia controller, storage manager, and signaling framework can help power system operators in upgrading their traditional grids [127] . Forecasting, scheduling, and integrating renewables with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) should be the focus of future interconnected intelligent electricity networks. Another promising area of study is to build a game-theoretic smart planning tool and a data-driven analysis for capacity planning, sizing, addition, and expansion of the network. Furthermore, several instances and case studies of mixed-energy systems should be investigated, with an emphasis being placed on the interaction between planning, operations, and cost of the cross-border electricity network [126] . Overall, the benefits, strategies, barriers, and challenges of global power grid connectivity are as follows: • Despite the regional power trade (economic, environmental, and technical benefits), cross-border connectivity is plagued by issues such as regulations, policies, standards, investment, and energy security.  • Apart from the technical, political, and financial considerations, cross-border trade has implementation obstacles involving land acquisition and environmental clearance.  • Transnational grid interconnection ensures reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy supply.    Advancements in transnational electricity networks will provide more comprehensive advantages if they are connected with the sustainable development goals during the planning, implementation, and operational phases. Thus, the globally interconnected grid provides a reliable, affordable, and long-term electricity supply.   7 Discussion on future trends In continuation of the above mentioned facts, it is evident that the development of renewables on a continental-scale will provide more than half of the world’s power by 2050, because the costs of solar, wind, and energy storage will continue to decline [106,128,129] . Future research on the global clean energy system could focus on the following potential areas: End-Use sector:  Solar PV can help in the decarbonization of the building, transportation, and industrial sectors. Although temporary energy storage enables an extreme level of emission reduction, massive clean storage capacity is required to achieve global decarbonization in the power sector. Demand flexibility is crucial because it provides solid capacity while lowering the cost of decarbonization. More research is needed to breakthrough the barriers in optimizing solar PV, batteries, and load flexibility to achieve the corresponding private and grid advantages [130] . Building sector:  Solar shingles, walls, windows, and rooftop-mounted PV continue to be a small niche market. More study is needed to increase the long-term sustainability of PV-integrated buildings and allied products such as PV coatings and glass. There is a need for research to identify techniques for dividing incentives to revitalize global PV markets. Further study on the pilot rate implementation of optimum retail tariffs for specific consumers, distributed resources, and rooftop solar PV technologies is needed [131] . Transportation sector:  Coordination and control of an electric vehicle charging station with a photovoltaic power generation unit necessitate technological, business, and legislative solutions. One of the main topics in future research is to enable solar-to-EV-to-grid applications by withstanding more frequent charging and discharging cycles of batteries. Another prominent trend has been the combination of rapid charging technologies with solar power and storage. Thus, advanced technologies in the integration of electrolyzers with solar generation is one of the important directions in future research. The cost-competitive production of clean hydrogen will decrease the electrolysis investment costs, enhance efficiency, and reduce the solar electricity prices. One of the potential research areas to enable solar-to-FCEV-to-grid applications is the use of improved membrane and corrosion-resistant bipolar plate materials, reduction of platinum group metal catalysts, and improvement of control system schemes [132,133] . Industry sector:  Industries must investigate several decarbonization strategies such as electrification, solar-powered fuels, and usage of carbon-free thermal energy. More studies might look at near-term cost reductions in a photoelectrochemical and thermochemical generation to develop innovative zero-carbon solar fuels. Furthermore, alternative energy sources such as ammonia for shipping, hydrogen, and synthetic hydrocarbons for aviation, as well as their distinct near- and long-term responsibilities, are mainstream developments. Further research into solar PV technology is required to solve social and political issues in polluting industries as well as tradeoffs in equity and environmental justice [134] . Utility-scale:  One of the research trends is to realize terawatt-scale solar PV deployment on existing power infrastructure. Because of technology advancements, much of the deployment will take the form of large utility-scale power plants, as well as residential and business rooftop systems. Solar technology will enable the cost-effective deployment of buildings, water bodies, and agriculture. Further study should be conducted on the regional distribution of solar’s resilience benefits, public benefits such as enhanced air quality and climate change mitigation, and electricity consumer benefits [135] . Technology advancements:  Building continental-scale clean energy generation capacity and cross-border grid connections are critical challenges. Moreover, regulation of bidirectional power flow over power transmission networks is an important control challenge. Another technical challenge is optimizing the power flow from the most abundant and cheapest renewable energy to high energy consumption in real-time [136] . Therefore, the combination of clean energy interconnection, ultra-high voltage lines with protection devices, and advanced smart grid control is a future research area. One of the research trends is to identify the most cost-effective solution to operate the power system with more than 50% of VRE [137] . Uncertain power generation from VRE resources, low system inertia in inverter-based systems, and fluctuating load demand affect the stability of the power system. Therefore, the power balance between demand and supply, suitable control concepts in inverter-dominated systems, and power system stability should be the key focus of future research in clean energy networks. In addition, fault current and intentional islanding during a fault are major issues in renewable-dominated grid. Intelligent overcurrent protection schemes for detecting, as well as clearing faults and communication-based active anti-islanding methods, are potential areas for research [138,139] . Technical Development:  Commercial crystalline silicon (c-si) wafer technology research aims to produce 400–550 W from 2.1–2.5 square meters with an efficiency of 19%–22%, to lower the cost of PV modules to around USD 0.17/W. The major tendency is to enhance efficiency in non-silicon-based thin-film technologies such as Perovskites, Copper Indium Gallium Selenide Cells, and Cadmium Telluride. To improve system output levels, further research should be focused on advanced cell architectures such as tandem, bifacial solar cells, half cells, multi-busbars, and solar shingles. Furthermore, Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technology is another promising study option for meeting the aim of 50% net thermal-to-electrical efficiency and an LCOE of USD 50/MWh by 2030 [129,140] .  8 Conclusion The present review outlines the role of low-carbon technologies in the transformation of the global energy system to combat climate change. Developments in solar and other clean energy technologies have enabled a significant increase in deployment in the energy sector to decarbonize the global electricity system. Despite these advancements, many challenges have been addressed in this study for reaching 100% renewable electricity future. Conclusions and possible research directions can be formulated as follows: • A global investment of up to 18 trillion USD in VRE technologies with a generating capacity of 6093 gigawatts is required to fulfill 25% of the total estimated electricity demand of 244 petawatt hours in 2050. This has been enabled through global renewable grid connections and breakthroughs in HVDC transmission technologies.  • Of all the low-carbon technology alternatives, solar PV has the highest potential to reduce emissions by 4.9 Gt CO 2   , accounting for 21% of the emission mitigation in the energy sector by 2050. From the findings of this study, cumulative solar deployment of 8519 GW would serve 25% of global electricity demand.  • Although the proposed global power grid connectivity has several impediments to solar PV development, innovations and technological solutions will foster the deployment of solar PV systems. Continued technological progress in solar is critical to achieving cost-effective and economy-wide grid decarbonization.  • Transcontinental grid connectivity would allow countries to not only trade electricity but also optimize the energy surpluses and deficits across the region based on future forecasts.  • For a sustainable energy future, unleashing the massive potential of solar PV can facilitate extensive decarbonization of the global electric grid to achieve sustainable development goals (affordable and clean energy) and climate targets by 2050 without raising expected electricity prices.  • Future studies should extend the precise approaches to accomplishing 100% emission reduction. SDG 7 achievement will catalyze measures to realize the Paris Climate Agreement.  • Future research directions include the interconnection of renewables with data centers, internet services, transportation, and cellular networks. Other essential aspects of a future renewable-supported intelligent electricity network include information security and user privacy.  • Maintaining resource adequacy, shifting net demand peaks, solar power curtailment, abatement costs and CO  2     emission implications, electricity pricing, energy storage, flexible demand, transmission, renewable capacity enhancement, extreme event analysis, and grid-integration issues are major future solar research directions.
