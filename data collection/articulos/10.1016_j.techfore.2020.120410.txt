Technology policy plays a prominent role in making progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This special issue addresses the question of how different science, technology and innovation (STI) policies in different localities around the world could promote the greater global good by helping to achieve the SDGs by 2030. In addition, we take a critical look at the challenges posed by the uneven global distribution of innovation and development capacities.   Keywords SDGs  Science  Technology  Innovation  Policy  STI  Sustainability    1 Introduction In 2015, the United Nations adopted the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at its core (United Nations 2015 ). The 17 SDGs and their 169 targets aim to provide a comprehensive guiding framework for the world's development efforts until 2030 and to help governments and other relevant stakeholders devise evidence-based implementation and resource allocation strategies. This special issue on “SDGs and Technology Policy” brings together 10 contributions from various disciplines, including economics and political science, that either empirically or conceptually address technology policy in the context of the SDGs. Technology policy should play a prominent role in achieving the SDGs, but many challenges remain to create and implement policies that genuinely support sustainable development without exacerbating already existing global inequalities. Technology and knowledge transfer from developed countries to developing countries in particular has long been considered an indispensable tool for achieving sustainable development by allowing developing states to leapfrog toward the frontier of technological innovation in such areas as telecommunications, transport and energy generation (Schwachula et al., 2014 ). The Means of Implementation (MOI) in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda include new mechanisms that aim to promote and facilitate the transfer of affordable and sustainable technological solutions to development and environmental problems, including a Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM) and a Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries. However, past efforts to construct workable mechanisms for the governance of technology transfer at the UN level do not provide much cause for optimism. For the most part, these efforts resulted in an incoherent scattering of initiatives among various UN entities and the lack of an institutional structure than can perform the needed coordination and facilitation tasks. This special issue will therefore not only look at global technology policy making but also include a range of studies that highlight opportunities and challenges in various governance levels, geographical regions and technology fields.  2 Sustainable development and technology policy Technology policy is a widely used and often politicized term with multiple definitions. In its earlier meanings, the concept referred primarily to targeted industrial policy but has since evolved over time to include the interconnected concepts of innovation and science (Braun 1994 ; UNCTAD 2019 ). In this special issue, we use the broader concept of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy to better understand the interactions between technological development and the facilitation of SGDs (Huang et al., 2015 ; Lundvall and Borrás 2006 ; OECD 2018 ). Two central questions are key to the theme of this special issue. First, there is a question about the role of governmental policy or governance in guiding innovation. For some, collective guidance is considered necessary to reach the best outcome, particularly in some areas crucial for achievement of the SDGs, such as health, agriculture or energy, and for dealing with issues about democratic decision-making, equity and lasting change. The counterargument is that free market forces are a “machine that generates innovations and growth in dramatic profusion” (Baumol, 2004 : 2). From this perspective, state interventions in STI promotion are both unnecessary and counterproductive because free markets have the ability to focus on productive innovations and to self-correct when necessary. States should have a marginal role in the design and implementation of STI support measures for sustainable development. This volume adopts the former approach and sees, as discussed in more detail in this issue by Walsh et al. (2020) , free market forces alone as insufficient for innovation, particularly innovation for the world's poor (Rock et al., 2009 ; Chang et al., 2002 ). The second central question revolves around the analytic approach for innovation, particularly whether innovation processes are the same in all contexts. Some would argue that innovation contexts in countries at different levels of development are substantively different (Schwachula et al., 2014 ). Countries at different stages of socioeconomic development are also in need of very different technology policy goals and instruments. While industrialized countries may want to use certain STI policies to help their industries maintain or gain a competitive edge in global markets, politicians in developing countries might want to employ very different strategies to protect infant domestic industries or to ensure the provision of basic social services. This special issue is not primarily interested in the details of the domestic politics behind specific STI policies but instead focuses on the larger question of how different STI policies in different localities around the world could be beneficial to the greater global good of achieving the SDGs by 2030. At the same time, it also aims to take a critical look at the challenges posed by the uneven global distribution of innovation and development capacities. A final key question to which this special issue speaks is whether the SDG framework can direct the development of innovation to address sustainability issues. Simply stated, the SDG framework, with an emphasis on universality and equality between the goals, seems an odd fit for the novel and unpredictable innovations necessary for sustainability (Phillips 2018 ). Others criticize the utopian bureaucratic nature of the goals as a project that fundamentally ignores the drivers of poverty and environmental damage (Spangenberg 2017 ) or worse as a waste of time (Easterly 2015 ). There is plenty to criticize in the framework of the SDGs and their ability to develop a clear guide for innovation politics; however, this special issue highlights a number of applied opportunities for the SDG framework to spur the development or adoption of innovation. This is unlikely to be direct or linear in its application but instead shaped by the governance context.  3 The contributions to this special issue Out of more than 80 initial submissions, ten papers were finally accepted for this special issue. The final contributions were chosen on the basis of certain selection criteria, such as the originality and appropriateness of their contributions to the theme of the special issue, a balanced mix of disciplinary and methodological backgrounds, and a wide collection of technology policy fields that help to capture the breadth of the debate. The regional focus of the contributions is also diverse, covering five specific country case studies and five cross-country studies. The studies address different governance levels, from discussions of the global level of UN policy making over regional-level EU initiatives to in-depth studies of specific technology policies of certain countries. The diverse focus of the contributions allows us to gain a better understanding of the various technology policy fields that are relevant for achieving the SDGs. At the same time, they also highlight the many remaining challenges on different policy levels. Five of the contributions to this special issue focus primarily on aspects of STI policy making on different governance levels. The first paper by Walsh et al. (2020)  titled “The role of science, technology and innovation in the UN 2030 agenda” starts at the global level and provides a timely discussion on the STI policy activities in and around the UN system, including the still relatively dormant UN Technology Facilitation Mechanism (TFM). In a more fundamental way, the authors also critically evaluate the role of STI in achieving the SDGs within the context of current economic theory. They question whether currently available technology is suitable for assisting transformation toward the SDGs and propose an alternative model that emphasizes reorienting STI more specifically toward the SDGs. In their article “Sustainable Development Goals in the research and innovation policy of the European Union”, Kastrinos and Weber (2020)  move to the regional level and present a study on the European Union's BOHEMIA project. This project is a recent example of a foresight exercise that helped to inform the governance of the EU's STI policy through the European Commission's proposal for Horizon Europe, the framework program for research and innovation. The authors explore how the foresight project connected the SDG development paradigm with the EU framework program and argue that an effective STI policy for the SDGs needs to incorporate methods to strengthen future-oriented reflexivity in policy design and implementation. Li et al. (2020)  switch to national-level STI policy in their paper “Technological catching up and innovation policies in China: What is behind this largely successful story?”. The study explores the case of China's rapid technological advancement and explores the lessons that can be learned from China's STI policy experiences. The authors identify the development of high-tech markets and the simultaneous development of the financial sector as the two crucial factors for the facilitation of innovation. A second country-level case study by Surana et al. (2020)  titled “Strengthening science, technology, and innovation-based incubators to help achieve Sustainable Development Goals: Lessons from India” looks at India's national policy of creating STI entrepreneurship incubators. The authors argue that Indian startup incubators are a useful government tool to correct market failures regarding sustainable development needs. They track the historical development and policy changes in relation to these incubators and find that to be more effective, the government should strengthen these programs and align the SDGs more closely to the goals of the STI incubator system. You et al. (2020)  focus on the national policy level in their article “Closing Technological Gaps to Alleviate Poverty: Evidence from 17 Sub-Saharan African Countries” by conducting a comparative cross-country study on 17 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries between 1987 and 2014. Their central question is how technological development can impact poverty alleviation (SDG 1), and the study finds a significant interrelation between the technological catch-up and the economic performance of the case studies. The remaining studies in this special issue focus in greater detail on specific STI policy areas. Two contributions highlight the opportunities and challenges for the realization of a green mobility sector – which intersect with SDGs 7, 9, 11 and 13 – from different angles. In their paper “Pursuing supply chain sustainable development goals through the adoption of green practices and enabling technologies: A cross-country analysis of LSPs”, Centobelli et al. (2020)  conduct a cross-country study in the European Union and use the example of emerging green practices and technologies in European logistics service providers (LSPs) to research the potential of reducing energy consumption and emission levels by greening the industrial supply chain. Their findings suggest the great emission reduction potential of national STI policies that target intermediaries in global supply chains, such as large firms and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) operating in freight transport and the logistics service industry. The paper “Economic analysis of dynamic inductive power transfer roadway charging system under public-private partnership - Evidence from New Zealand” by Sheng et al. (2020)  has a similar focus on green mobility but uses the case of national technology policy making in New Zealand to demonstrate the potential of private-public partnerships (PPPs) for accelerating electric vehicle deployment. They conclude that the initial installation costs and potential investment risks of modern technological solutions such as roadway charging networks that can charge electric vehicles in motion could be met by smartly designed PPP models that help reduce investment uncertainties. Two contributions explore the crucial issue of STI for clean and affordable energy (SDG7) from different levels of governance. Hille et al. (2020)  take a global perspective on renewable energy STI policies in their study “Environmental regulation and innovation in renewable energy technologies: Does the policy instrument matter?”. Based on patent data for a large sample of 194 countries and territories, they conduct a cross-country comparison of the effectiveness of policy support mechanisms in the wind and solar energy sectors. Their findings indicate that strong renewable energy support policies, such as mandatory targets or fiscal incentives, have a significant impact on the development of these technologies, especially if these STI policies are long-term oriented. The paper “Assessing the impact of renewable energy on local development and the Sustainable Development Goals: Insights from a small Philippine island” by Bertheau (2020)  localizes the discussion of renewable energy STI policies. It looks at the challenge of rural electrification and uses a field survey study in the Philippines to investigate the effects of renewable energy-based small-scale grids to electrify the nation's myriad island communities. His findings support similar studies in the region that indicate a general improvement of living conditions after the implementation of such decentralized electrification policies. However, he also demonstrates that such interventions often fall short of achieving an even greater positive impact because they often lack a holistic approach that includes supplementary measures to address poverty alleviation. The author argues that, if done properly, local electrification policies using micro grids can unlock SDG7’s potential as a catalyst for achieving other goals, such as the empowerment of women (SDG5), the improvement of health (SDG3) and the stimulation of economic growth (SDG8). The final contribution by Secundo et al. (2020) , titled “Sustainable development, intellectual capital and technology policies”, closes the discussion by presenting an overview of the literature on the interconnections between “intellectual capital” (IC), an integral element of STI policy design and implementation processes, and sustainable development. The authors conclude that the different components of IC are key drivers of the development of technology policies and sustainable growth and that any meaningful STI strategy needs to take them into account. The authors conclude by proposing a future research agenda to further explore the interconnections between IC and effective sustainable STI policies.  4 Concluding remarks Technology plays a key role in sustainable development. This showcase issue includes several examples about how different STI policies in various localities around the world impact innovation. The studies not only highlight the crucial importance of STI for achieving the SDGs by 2030 but also point out some of the challenges in different levels of governance that still need to be addressed. This special issue has two major findings related to the debates discussed above. First, the impact of the SDGs on innovation is currently very context specific. Without significant means of implementation at the global level, the SDGs are reliant on lower-level innovation contexts. Some of these contexts will be very helpful, some will be difficult, but innovation is unlikely to be frictionless or globally equitable as a result. Second, the relationship between STI and the SDGs is likely to be highly shaped by the ideas at these various levels. Better ideas at the level of the UN can have a dramatic impact on the STI policies adopted by regional organizations, national governments, and local governments. Currently, the level of idea generation at the highest levels has not spurred broad-based efforts that can adequately deal with the large-scale challenges faced. There are many options for more effective ideas about STI within the SDG framework. For example, the application of the UN's Inclusive Wealth (IW) as a measure of the aggregate wealth of society would be a very useful tool for understanding the future impacts of the SDGs (Dasgupta et al., 2015 ). IW includes the value of natural capital along with the values of human capital, manufactured capital, and social capital (UNESCO/UNU-IHDP and UNEP 2014 ; Managi and Kumar 2018 ; Managi 2020 ) and is a sufficient statistic for showing whether or not global society is on a sustainable trajectory (Polasky et al., 2019 ). Measuring the long-term sustainability with socioeconomic pathways commonly discussed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or in debates regarding the energy-growth nexus relies mainly on an assessment analysis of large-scale projects (Kurniawan and Managi 2018 ; Sugiawan and Managi 2019 ). However, STI policies sometimes need to address much more specific questions and localities, which leads to the challenge of correctly assessing their impacts using conventional measurement tools. Therefore, the inclusive wealth approach is suggested for future studies on the effectiveness of technology policy for sustainable development.
