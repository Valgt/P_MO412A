                  Background
                  Among the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), target 2.2 focuses on ending malnutrition, including stunting, and wasting and overweight among under-5 children by 2030. These conditions increasingly co-exist within communities forming the triple burden of malnutrition, which negatively affects human health and the society, a situation currently exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Food science innovations are resulting in new approaches that can potentially thwart the triple burden. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need to intensify applied food science and technology research towards addressing all forms of malnutrition.
               
                  Scope and approach
                  This commentary provides an overview of the current progress on the emerging food innovations for addressing malnutrition. We discussed the existing evidence related to food processing methods, food matrix factors, and nutrient bioavailability in relation to malnutrition. Neglected and underutilized crops were also discussed as a key factor in mitigating the triple burden.
               
                  Key findings and conclusions
                  With only ten years to the deadline, there has been a slow progress in achieving the SDGs, including target 2.2. While there is a need for basic research, we suggest increased effort in putting existing knowledge into practice, and in closing the gap and increasing collaboration between researchers, the industry, policymakers and consumers. These issues need to be integrated ab initio into research programs. While it is desirable to develop new knowledge, it is crucial to identify constraints affecting the application of existing knowledge in mitigating the triple burden in regions where the prevalence of undernutrition is at its highest.

Keywords SDG 2  Malnutrition  Nutritional deficiencies  Food matrix  Bioavailability  Food processing  Food diversification    1 Introduction Over 820 million people worldwide (or 1 in 9 people) suffer from hunger (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, & WHO, 2019 ). In 2018, an estimated 149 million children under the age of 5 years had stunted growth, which is a feature of undernutrition characterised by suboptimal height-for-age. Similarly, the prevalence of overweight in children under 5 years old has risen to 40.1 million, with almost half occurring in Asia and one-quarter in Africa. These conditions have been projected to worsen because of the food system disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Headey et al., 2020 ). With micronutrient deficiency, these issues increasingly co-exist within the same communities, thus forming the triple burden of malnutrition. With the current trends of the nutrition indicators, it is evident that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2 targets of ending world hunger will not be met by the 2030 deadline. In addressing hunger, it is important to pay attention to the need for sufficient nutrients and the prevention of micronutrient deficiencies, in addition to improving agricultural and food productivity. There is a growing development of emerging food technologies with promise in generating functional and bioactive ingredients for promoting human health and nutrition security. Other fundamental research developments involve reducing nutritional deficiencies, integrating neglected and underutilized crops in product development, and altering the food matrix to enhance nutrient bioavailability and reduce nutrition deficiencies, etc. Thousands of scientific articles published every year propose several practical applications of new findings related to nutrition security. However, much of the research findings are yet to be scaled up and adopted in mitigating hunger around the world. It is worth noting that food science and technology innovations have significantly influenced the modern food system, especially in solving nutritional deficiency and food safety challenges. This includes the development of methods for preserving essential nutrients, micronutrient-fortified foods (e.g., iodized salt, vitamin A in butter, fortified milk and flour, golden rice), and technologies for drying, canning and preservation of food. Currently, the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies and the number of people suffering from hunger are still increasing yearly, even with the SDG emphasis to reduce undernutrition. This underscores the gap between the development of innovative research and its uptake into practice in regions facing nutrition security, in addition to other confounding factors including funding constraints, political issues, etc. To successfully translate research findings on food innovations into practice, it is crucial to consider: (1) involving policymakers in the research and development process, (2) providing evidence-based proof of efficacy within the target population, (3) minimizing the cost of implementing and communicating the new strategies or products, and (4) consumer acceptability of new products taking into account the food habits and culture of the target population.  2 Sustainable development goal (SDG) 2 Since the SDG targets were set in 2015, there has been a consistent increase in hunger globally; the highest prevalence is found in Africa, where one-fifth of the population (one-quarter billion people in 2018) are undernourished. Similarly, 770 million people in the world in 2017 were food insecure (FAO, 2017 ). SDG goal 2 seeks to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030” (General Assembly, United Nations, 2014 ), with section 2.2  listing targets and indicators related to the triple burden of malnutrition. Specifically, the main purpose of SDG target 2.2 is to mitigate malnutrition among children under 5 years old by 2030, which includes stunting (indicator 2.2.1), and wasting and overweight (indicator 2.2.2). Prior to the deadline, the goal is to achieve the following targets by 2025: reduce stunting by 40%, reduce wasting to under 5%, and achieve zero increase in obesity in under-5 children, and reduce anaemia by 50% in women between 15 and 49 years old (WHO, 2017 ). 2.1 Undernutrition Micronutrient deficiencies, especially iron deficiency in women of reproductive age, commonly known as anaemia, and vitamin A deficiency in pre-school age children, are a particular public health concern especially in the developing countries. In 2018, 49.5 million children under 5 years old had wasting (suboptimal weight-for-height), which mostly result from insufficient intake or extreme loss of essential nutrients. The most recent data showed that the global prevalence of wasting in children under-5 (7.3%) is still above the 2025 (<5%) and 2030 (<3%) targets (FAO et al., 2019 ). Many initiatives were proposed to reduce the prevalence of undernutrition, such as the school food and nutrition programmes, which involves providing meals to food-insecure children, and the social protection programmes, which ensure food security and healthy eating habits for vulnerable populations. Moreover, the “double-duty actions” strategy was recommended for addressing undernutrition and obesity simultaneously and includes, for example, promoting breastfeeding to protect against childhood stunting and wasting and at the same time reduce the risk of overweight and obesity in later years (FAO et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, undernutrition is likewise addressed by the increase of the agricultural productivity, especially by smallholder farmers, thus ensuring a sustainable food production and a sufficient access to safe food.  2.2 Overnutrition In 2018, 40 million children under-5 (5.9%) were overweight (i.e., high weight-for-height); one-quarter of the affected children live in Africa, where the overweight prevalence rate (4.9%) is close to the global rate. Childhood overweight and wasting are often carried into adolescence and adulthood; this implies a higher risk of health problems and psychological effects in affected individuals (United Nations, 2019 ). The increasing overweight and obesity prevalence is thought to be fuelled by the dietary and lifestyle changes associated with urbanization (FAO & ECA, 2018 ). For instance, higher household income was linked to the rising prevalence of overweight and obesity in South Africa (FAO & ECA, 2018 ). The promotion of healthy diets is important in fighting the obesity epidemic. Governments have a range of “hard” and “soft” policy options aimed at making healthy diets affordable and accessible to consumers. This includes setting bans and regulations or providing practical information to the vulnerable populations. For instance, the recent WHO recommendation on the 20% sugar tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption by 20%, has been implemented by only a few countries in Africa (FAO & ECA, 2018 ). Another factor is the access to and consumption of diverse diets by promoting the production of food crops along with increasing access to diverse food categories (Fraval et al., 2019 ).   3 Previous contributions of food science and technology In the past, food science and technology research has led to widely adopted innovations for food storage, preservation, and fortification, such as drying, canning, chemical preservation, refrigeration (chilling and freezing), and nutrient conservation (Floros, 2011 ). In addition, high pressure processing and microwave are the main novel food processing technologies used worldwide. Besides, the use of emerging innovative technologies, such as pulsed electric field, ultraviolet light radiation, infrared heating, Ohmic heating, ozone, power ultrasound, cold atmospheric plasma, and electrolysed water, is rapidly expanding in addressing productivity issues, extending product shelf life without affecting the nutritional content, and improving organoleptic attributes and product specifications (Jermann, Koutchma, Margas, Leadley, & Ros-Polski, 2015 ). Some early developments related to nutrition include the discovery of the important roles of micronutrients such as vitamins, iron, iodine and calcium in human metabolism and health. These discoveries were preceded by periods that recorded high prevalence of genu varum from rickets (caused by vitamin D deficiency) and the enlarged thyroid gland from goitre (caused by iodine deficiency). Thereafter, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for indispensable macronutrients and micronutrients was developed in 1941, for optimal functioning of the body. The challenge of obtaining the RDA from staple foods resulted in widespread fortification of food products with essential micronutrients (Floros et al., 2010 ), although the first fortified food, iodized salt, was introduced two decades earlier. Nowadays, there is a wide range of fortified foods including staples such as milk, pasta, egg, butter, vegetable oil, bread, and cereal flour (Chadare et al., 2019 ). Biofortification strategy has also been used to improve the nutritional quality of foods. For example, the reduction in vitamin A deficiency was achieved by the enrichment of rice with vitamin A (Golden rice) and by bacterial release of β-carotene through microbial fermentation (Liyanage & Hettiarachchi, 2011 ). It is important to note that the application of food science innovations depends heavily on environmental, economic, religious and sociocultural factors in any given society (Floros, 2011 ; Floros et al., 2010 ). These factors will determine the choice of foods and raw materials (plant- or animal-based; cereals, legumes or roots/tubers; etc.), and processing methods (cooking, drying, fermentation, etc.) likely to thrive in the society. So far, agricultural and food technologies are credited to have resulted in (1) a decrease in some health issues associated with nutrient deficiency; (2) attainment of a year-round safe and reliable food supply; (3) a wide selection of palatable foods, due to processing; (4) a relative decrease in food wastage, due to preservation; (5) convenient food products that require minimal preparation; and others (Floros, 2011 ; Floros et al., 2010 ). However, there is a discordance between these claims and the current rate of malnutrition in the world.  4 Emerging and practical approaches for addressing the triple burden 4.1 Leveraging the wealth of nutrients in neglected and underutilized crops (NUCs) Neglected crops are mainly cultivated by traditional farmers in the ‘center of origin’ of the crops, for income and subsistence of the local population. On the other hand, underutilized crops are grown more widely or intensively but their edible parts are not fully utilized because of agricultural, sociocultural or economic reasons. For instance, producers, processors and consumers may see these crops as less competitive than other crops (based on yield, market, palatability, etc.) when cultivated in a similar environment (IPGRI, 2002 ). To fulfil their nutritional needs, consumers around the world increasingly derive their basic diets from a narrow list of crops. For instance, rice, wheat and maize are the major sources of carbohydrates in the list of crops for human consumption (Mayes et al., 2012 ). As a result, plans to achieve food security have included the modification of these and other staple crops, genetically or through conventional breeding, to improve their yield, postharvest qualities and nutritional values (Mayes et al., 2012 ). Interestingly, many neglected crops are rich in macronutrients and micronutrients, and have the potential for further development into food products for addressing the triple burden of malnutrition (Chivenge, Mabhaudhi, Modi, & Mafongoya, 2015 ; Dansi et al., 2012 ; Mabhaudhi, Chimonyo, Chibarabada, & Modi, 2017 ). There is a diversity of neglected crops categorized as cereals (e.g., millets), roots and tubers (e.g., Taro [Colocasia esculenta  L. Schott]), legumes (e.g., Bambara groundnut [Vigna subterranean ]), and leafy vegetables and fruits (e.g., Wild watermelon [Citrullus lanatus  L.]). These NUCs are considered essential sources of high quality nutrients, especially carbohydrates, proteins, minerals and vitamins (Chivenge et al., 2015 ). Despite the prospects, there is a dearth of national and regional policies that promote the integration of NUCs in the food system in local, regional or international markets. Considering the nutrient density of many NUCs, food diversification should be adopted at the local and regional levels as a strategy for decreasing the prevalence of undernutrition and overnutrition. Diverse agricultural and food systems are needed to sustainably feed and meet the nutritional requirements of 9 billion people while simultaneously supporting the farmers and local economy (Padulosi, Thompson, & Rudebjer, 2013 ). Acknowledging the value of NUCs in the food system is crucial as they offer the genetic biodiversity that can provide an array of nutrient composition and quality for mitigating the triple burden and improving food and nutrition security. Thus, the NUCs occupy an important position in the food and agricultural systems in providing the food diversity needed to mitigate the current nutritional challenges (Padulosi et al., 2013 ).  4.2 Beyond basic nutrition: functional foods and their health benefits The increasing trend in functional foods is attributed to their roles in preventing diseases and improving the wellbeing of consumers (Bigliardi & Galati, 2013 ). This is also a practical and safe approach for reducing disease risks and achieving optimal health status (Granato et al., 2020 ; Siró, Kápolna, Kápolna, & Lugasi, 2008 ). Table 1   shows the different types of functional foods and examples of their biologically active components. The rising interest in functional foods may be because of the increasing healthcare cost, life expectancy, and consumer knowledge of health and attitude in improving quality of life (Granato et al., 2020 ; Kotilainen, Rajalahti, Ragasa, & Pehu, 2006 ). Commercial functional food products are more established in developed countries, especially China, USA, and the EU. Nonetheless, locally processed products in developing countries, where the prevalence of chronic undernutrition and overweight are the highest, need to be evaluated for potential health benefits. Furthermore, some developing countries are expanding their economy through the export of active ingredients for functional food development in developed countries (Williams, Pehu, & Ragasa, 2006 ). Considering the prevalence of the triple burden, developing countries need to increase their investment in R&D activities to scale up traditional technologies and use locally sourced raw materials for the production of functional food products. This would be a more sustainable and cost effective approach for mitigating the triple burden of malnutrition, given the vast biodiversity in these regions, compared to the importation of finished products from other countries.  4.3 Sustainable processing for enhancing nutrient bioavailability The most prevalent health issues related to nutritional deficiencies, especially in many developing countries, include anaemia and disorders of iodine and vitamin A deficiencies. For a society that consumes predominantly plant-based diets, the deficiencies may be caused by suboptimal nutrient bioavailability. This represents the proportion of orally consumed food components that is absorbed in the intestine, distributed in tissues and subsequently used for the normal functioning of the body (Aguilera, 2019 ; Sun, Acquah, Aluko, & Udenigwe, 2020 ). Until recently, the bioavailability of micronutrients related to the food matrix remained poorly considered in nutrition research (Capuano & Pellegrini, 2019 ; Sun et al., 2020 ), especially in the global efforts towards achieving nutrition security. Several factors influence nutrient bioavailability. Many developing countries have a high prevalence of iron, zinc and vitamin A deficiencies, and suboptimal bioavailability of the micronutrients is proposed to be a major contributing factor (Platel & Srinivasan, 2016 ). Nutrient bioavailability is mostly reduced by inherent antinutritional factors in the plant tissues, in addition to processing methods used to prepare the food. Nonetheless, some methods used to prepare foods, e.g. heating, soaking or mechanical processing, can enhance nutrient bioaccessibility by breaking down the food structure and facilitating the release of the essential nutrients during gastrointestinal digestion (Table 2  ). Household methods used for food preparation, e.g. cooking and fermentation, are known to increase iron and β-carotene bioavailability from plant foods (Platel & Srinivasan, 2016 ). Fermentation is an integral part of different traditional food cultures across the world, and a promising tool for improving the nutrient bioavailability and health properties of foods (Anom & Udenigwe, 2015 ). In addition, food acidulants also increase the bioavailability of divalent metals (zinc and iron) and β-carotene. Other food components that increased the bioaccessibility of micronutrients include garlic and onion rich in sulphur compounds, vegetables (e.g., carrot) rich in β-carotene, spices (e.g., red and black pepper), and ginger (Platel & Srinivasan, 2016 ). It is also important to consider the interaction between food matrix components and its effect on nutrient bioavailability. The interactions of minerals with other micronutrients may also influence nutrient bioavailability (Table 2 ). For instance, a nutritional dose of calcium can impair dietary lycopene bioavailability in healthy humans (Borel et al., 2016 ). This is particularly important because food fortification with the essential divalent minerals, as a strategy to mitigate micronutrient deficiency, can potentially reduce the bioavailability of carotenoids and lipophilic micronutrients (Borel et al., 2016 ). Therefore, a detailed knowledge of the food matrix and roles of emerging processing technologies are crucial in developing food products and dietary approaches for enhancing the bioavailability of essential nutrients (Platel & Srinivasan, 2016 ). The complexity of the food structure is scarcely considered by decision makers in nutritional guidelines. As shown in Fig. 1  , nutrition and food scientists, the food industry, and other stakeholders need to collaborate more in R&D and policymaking to improve the practical use of emerging technologies and food ingredients in combating malnutrition. Effective communication will also help to improve consumer knowledge of the influence of household processing on nutrient bioaccessibility and bioavailability (Weaver et al., 2014 ).   5 Uptake of the food innovations by developing countries The strategies discussed above could be applied in mitigating the triple burden in the developing countries with the highest prevalence of malnutrition. Several food-processing and preparation methods can be used in households to enhance micronutrient bioavailability when consuming predominantly plant-based foods (Hotz & Gibson, 2007 ). In order to achieve these results, a variety of interventions need to be developed by the governments and stakeholders in order to provide evidence-based information on the processing methods to the consumers. For this concept to be sustainable, it is important for externally developed food innovations to be adapted in ways that fit the resources and knowledgebase of the target community. Although developing countries have a rich food biodiversity and sources of raw materials, there is a dearth of food industry dedicated to value addition. This gap may be due to the high cost associated with new food product development, including the cost of R&D, processing, regulatory compliance, certification, and marketing (Williams et al., 2006 ). Major challenges and recommendations for tackling the barriers faced by the developing countries in producing functional foods are presented in Fig. 2  .  6 Challenges and practical issues Across the world, there is a gap between generating research findings and transferring the knowledge into practical applications. To close this gap, linkages need to be established among stakeholders throughout the research process (e.g., co-design of research projects by policymakers, the industry and researchers) (European Union & Expo 2015 EU Scientific Steering Committee, 2015 ). Scientists working on practical issues in isolation may not know the most relevant questions, or have the authority to directly influence decisions. Involving decision-makers in the research process ab initio  ensures that the research outcome would meet regulatory needs, thus facilitating the knowledge adoption. Creating spaces for interaction between researchers and policymakers has helped throughout the process of food security policy changes (Cramer et al., 2018 ). After co-designing projects, scientists must maintain regular contacts, share data and be open to modify the research focus in response to feedback from policymakers and stakeholders (Rosen, 2018 ). Moreover, evidence-based efficacy is needed for novel functional ingredients intended for use in achieving nutrition security and mitigating health issues associated with the triple burden. There is a need for food and nutrition scientists to collaborate with researchers in the medical fields to rapidly achieve this goal. As much as possible, evidence from studies in different model systems, epidemiological studies, and human intervention studies are needed to fulfil the efficacy validation of the new functional foods (Siró et al., 2008 ). Another factor to consider is the cost of transferring the new technology or product into practice in the local food industry. The cost of developing and promoting a functional food product is expected to be significantly higher than that of a conventional product, which is about $1–2 million US per product (Musina et al., 2017 ; Siró et al., 2008 ), although the actual cost will depend on the economy of the region. This cost is also expected to be higher when making a health claim on the product. Besides the technological obstacles, there is a need to consider the regulatory hurdles and specific consumer needs when translating a food innovation in the different regions of the world. Notably, consumer acceptance is a major factor that determines the success of a food product in the market (Siró et al., 2008 ). Achieving consumer acceptance of a new product or nutritional behaviour is usually challenging (Nguyen et al., 2019 ; Papp-Bata, Csiki, & Szakály, 2018 ). A study reported that changes to the sensory properties of yogurt due to fortification with vitamin A and prebiotics led to reduced consumer acceptance (Hemsworth, Hekmat, & Reid, 2011 ). Strengthening the collaboration between food researchers, processors, consumer, scientists and health professionals would likely have a tremendous impact on the development of novel functional foods with high consumer acceptability (Papp-Bata et al., 2018 ). Nonetheless, food innovations have successfully addressed micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries. For instance, Golden Rice was developed by the biofortification technology to overcome vitamin A deficiency in developing countries where rice is the staple crop (Dubock, 2017 ). Other examples include national food fortification programs geared towards reducing the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency. For example, vitamin A deficiency has been reduced in Guatemala and Uganda through the fortification of sugar and vegetable oil with vitamin A (Berti, Faber, & Smuts, 2014 ).  7 Conclusion In summary, an increased use of emerging food innovations is needed towards achieving nutrition security. Despite the progress in food science, the prevalence of malnutrition in the world is not improving over the past decade. In fact, the nutritional challenges are projected to be compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a strategy to address SDG 2 target 2.2, we recommend that both immediate and long-term research and development efforts should focus on: (1) the value-addition and increased use of nutrient-rich neglected and underutilized crops to achieve food diversification; (2) the development of functional foods to reduce nutritional deficiencies and overnutrition; and (3) the application of knowledge about the food matrix to develop processing technologies for enhancing nutrient bioavailability and reducing micronutrient deficiencies. We recommend that governments, policymakers and the private sector, especially in the developing countries, should increase financial and resource investments in research and development to produce evidence-based strategies adapted to their local situations for preventing and controlling the triple burden of malnutrition. This should also involve reducing the gap between the stakeholders and getting all hands on deck in rapidly and effectively meeting SDG 2.2 targets and ending world hunger.
