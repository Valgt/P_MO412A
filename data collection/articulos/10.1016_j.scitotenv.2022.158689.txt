                  In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) set out 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. These goals highlight key objectives that must be addressed. Each target focuses on a unique perspective crucial to meeting these goals. Social, political, and economic issues are addressed to comprehensively review the main issues combating climate change and creating sustainable and environmentally friendly industries, jobs, and communities. Several mechanisms that involve judicious use of biological entities are among instruments that are being explored to achieve the targets of SDGs. Microalgae have an increasing interest in various sectors, including; renewable energy, food, environmental management, water purification, and the production of chemicals such as biofertilizers, cosmetics, and healthcare products. The significance of microalgae also arises from their tendency to consume CO2, which is the main greenhouse gas and the major contributor to the climate change. This work discusses the roles of microalgae in achieving the various SDGs. Moreover, this work elaborates on the contribution of microalgae to the circular economy. It was found that the microalgae contribute to all the 17th SDGs, where they directly contribute to 9th of the SDGs and indirectly contribute to the rest. The major contribution of the Microalgae is clear in SDG-6 “Clean water and sanitation”, SDG-7 “Affordable and clean energy”, and SDG-13 “Climate action”. Furthermore, it was found that Microalgae have a significant contribution to the circular economy.

These goals highlight key objectives that must be addressed. Each target focuses on a unique perspective crucial to meeting these goals. Social, political, and economic issues are addressed to comprehensively review the main issues combating climate change and creating sustainable and environmentally friendly industries, jobs, and communities. Several mechanisms that involve judicious use of biological entities are among instruments that are being explored to achieve the targets of SDGs. Microalgae have an increasing interest in various sectors, including; renewable energy, food, environmental management, water purification, and the production of chemicals such as biofertilizers, cosmetics, and healthcare products. The significance of microalgae also arises from their tendency to consume CO2 , which is the main greenhouse gas and the major contributor to the climate change. This work discusses the roles of microalgae in achieving the various SDGs. Moreover, this work elaborates on the contribution of microalgae to the circular economy. It was found that the microalgae contribute to all the 17th SDGs, where they directly contribute to 9th of the SDGs and indirectly contribute to the rest. The major contribution of the Microalgae is clear in SDG-6 “Clean water and sanitation”, SDG-7 “Affordable and clean energy”, and SDG-13 “Climate action”. Furthermore, it was found that Microalgae have a significant contribution to the circular economy.

These 17 SDGs are essential since they are integrated to enhance the social, economic, and environmental aspects worldwide. International efforts are required to guarantee the implementation of these SDGs. There were significant challenges to these targets, such as the COVID-19 pandemic followed by the global financial crisis and the nations' lack of intense collaboration to achieve these targets. Additionally, every country faces challenges such as an increasingly growing population, poor communications, scarcity of resources, lack of policies, political decisions, and inadequacy of finance among others. Such setbacks highlight the urgent need to accelerate our steps towards achieving these goals (Sutherland et al., 2021 ). Microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic microorganisms that grow in different environments. They can tolerate many parameters such as salinities, temperature, varying light intensities and pH ranges. They can develop various significant compounds via direct ways such as protein, vitamins, polysaccharides, carbohydrates, lipids, antioxidants, and pigments and via indirect ways such as biofuels (Lau et al., 2022 ; Kholssi et al., 2021a ). Microalgae grow in different environments where there are water and sunlight, such as rivers, lakes, ponds, seas, oceans, soils, and the bark of trees. The microalgae species are estimated at 80,000, and half of this number has been investigated at a large scale for commercial purposes. Microalgae are classified into three main groups: rhodophytes or red algae, including Gelidium  sp., Corallina officinalis , Rhodella  sp. and Porphyra  sp.; chlorophytes (green algae) such as Oedogonium  sp., Microspora  sp., Volvox  sp., and Chlamydomonas  sp.; and cyanobacteria  or green-blue chromophytes which contain diatoms. Microalgae can be utilized for coupling wastewater remediation and biofuel production because they tend to attain or use organic contaminants such as nitrite, nitrate, orthophosphate and ammonia in wastewater. Hence, cultivating wastewater microalgae for biofuel production is an innovative solution in the water-energy nexus minimizes energy production costs. Moreover, microalgae can produce valuable compounds such as antioxidants, sugar, and vitamins, representing a valuable food security solution (Chhandama et al., 2021 ). Microalgae cultivation to recycle material and energy represents a significant circular economic approach. Recently, there has been increasing interest from the academic, industrial, and commercial sectors to investigate and develop the potential routes for developing numerous valuable products from microalgae such as renewable biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, and biogas), bio-active products such as vitamins, carotenoids, lipids, lutein, peptides, astaxanthin, vitamins (A, B1, B6, B12, C, E, biotin, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, pantothenate, and folic acid), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and other valuable products such as pigments, chemical, and cosmetics. All these commercial products contribute to numerous sectors and drive the widespread applications of microalgae. Although the available large number of reviews discussing the progress done in harvesting techniques of microalgae (Singh and Patidar, 2018 ), products from microalgae (Sarkar et al., 2020 ; Levasseur et al., 2020 ), the role of microalgae in wastewater treatment (Chai et al., 2021 ; Hussain et al., 2021 ; Aditya et al., 2022 ; Nagarajan et al., 2022 ), and biofuel production (Ganesan et al., 2020a ; Suparmaniam et al., 2019 ; Sharma et al., 2022 ; Ma et al., 2022 ; Ray et al., 2022 ); there is limited work that discussed the role of the microalgae in achieving the various SDGs. Recently, Merlo et al. (Merlo et al., 2021 ) briefly discussed the microalgae's role in achieving a limited number of the various SDGs focusing on clean energy (SDG 7). The work did not detail the discussion of the role of microalgae in achieving the 17 SDGs. Also, the contribution of microalgae to the circular economy needs to be elaborated. In this context, the main target of this investigation is to highlight the contribution of microalgae to the sustainable development goals. The first part of this review represents the methodology of this work, followed by the contribution of microalgae to the 17 SDGs stated by the UNGA. The main question was, “How do microalgae assist in achieving these SDGs?”. The second target was to engage in research in microalgae technologies. Specifically, we highlight the innovative role of microalgae in wastewater remediation, biorefineries, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural technologies as it is linked to the support of the 17 UNs SDGs. This review explores these technologies and the current limitations and finally highlights the role of microalgae in enhancing the circular economy.  2 Methodology This investigation started with reporting keywords strongly linked to the subjects under review and other related keywords. The main keywords utilized in the review were [microalgae], [circular economy], [biofuel], and [bioproducts]. SCOPUS was used as the main searching tool for its reliability in scientific data. It was found that 45,052 scientific papers were linked to the keyword [microalgae] in the period (1999–2023). After limiting the research period to the past three years (2021−2023), the papers were limited to 9019, including research papers, book chapters, and reviews in the fields of environmental science (3141), agricultural and biological sciences (2311), energy (1894), chemical engineering (1763), biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology (1225), chemistry (634), earth and planetary sciences (573), materials science (536), engineering (404) and immunology and microbiology (350). To analyse the data, VOSviewer, a free bibliometric tool, was used to identify the main research areas in this subject. The data were imported to VOSviewer, followed by filtration of unrelated keywords. The mapping (Fig. 1 a ) represents six main clusters. Each cluster has only one colour; larger circles refer to the co-occurrence and importance of the keywords. The closeness of two keywords is represented by the links and the closer distance between these keywords. Each cluster has numerous keywords from which can be highlighted examples of microalgae (photosynthesis, nutrition, extraction and synthetic biology), bioremediation (wastewater treatment, toxicity, photobioreactor and microplastic), biodiesel (transesterification, combustion and emissions), biomass (pyrolysis, bio-oil and gasification), biorefinery (biohydrogen and bioenergy), and Astaxanthin (lipid and antioxidant). Fig. 1 a represents the links between microalgae and some significant keywords in this study. The mapping shows the significant connected research area and the main researcher groups working in this field (Fig. 1 b), which helps identify the structure of research opportunities and gaps.  3 Role of microalgae in achieving the SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of objectives that aim to give future generations a healthy lifestyle and a clean and risk-free environment. These goals fulfilled the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (Olabi et al., 2022 ; Obaideen et al., 2021 ; Sayed et al., 2021 ; Shehata et al., 2022a ; Shehata et al., 2022b ). This section will elaborate on the role of microalgae in achieving the 17th SDGs. 3.1 Goals 1 (no poverty) and 2 (zero hunger) In 2015, the UNGA set out 17 SDGs and 169 targets to be achieved by 2030. The main two goals are SDG 1, no poverty, which aims to end global poverty in all its entirety and SDG 2, zero hunger, which aims to end hunger, improve nutrition and achieve food security (Dhahri and Omri, 2020 ). There is a close relationship between poverty and hunger, as the former is the prime cause of hunger within developing countries. >700 million people still live-in extreme poverty around the world, surviving on less than GBP£1.52, equivalent to US$1.90 per day (Campagnolo and Davide, 2019 ). The rising cost of living due to the pandemic sees a record number of people from developed countries enter into poverty, with the cost-of-living soaring. The world population is projected to reach almost 10 billion by 2050 (Torres-Tiji et al., 2020 ); this problem will inherently worsen as the population increases and as infectious pestilence such as coronavirus rises. Remarkably, microalgae are a promising alternative for achieving the SDGs due to their adaptability and resilience to pestilence and global warming effects. Microalgae are unicellular organisms, as observed with the microscope (Pérez-Lloréns, 2020 ). The most abundant microalgae species are Bacillariophyta (diatoms), Cyanophyta (blue-green algae), Chrysophyta (golden algae), and Chlorophyta (green algae). Microalgae are a very favourable source of renewable and sustainable energy compared to other sources as they do not compete with the production of food for human consumption and do not require a freshwater source to grow (Anyanwu et al., 2018a ). Therefore, microalgae could play incredible roles in reducing poverty and hunger. Microalgae could be cultivated near cages with fish, crustaceans or molluscs in the open sea. However, integrated cultivation is a promising and sustainable approach to cultivating algae (Alaswad et al., 2015 ; Rasheed et al., 2022 ). The main advantages are the potential of achieving a high algae growth rate, as the medium will contain large quantities of ammonium nitrate and phosphorus compounds needed to improve and enhance algae growth rate. The algae could remove almost 100 % of these compounds, which can help contribute to reducing environmental pollution (Alaswad et al., 2015 ). Most importantly, the high growth rate of algae would translate to more food and a low cost of cultivation since the cost of the organic nutrient supplement is eliminated in this combined approach (Alaswad et al., 2015 ; Zhan et al., 2017 ; Anyanwu et al., 2018b ). Microalgae and macroalgae have been consumed for thousands of years in different cultures worldwide, most important in China, Japan, and Korea. Algae were traditionally consumed in salads, soups, or toppings (Rioux and Turgeon, 2015 ). Among the cultivated species was brown seaweed, around 5.7 million tons of “kombu” (Saccharina japonica ) and 2.1 million tons of “wakame” (Undaria pinnatifida ) were harvested in 2012 (Rioux and Turgeon, 2015 ). The algae Porphyra , also called “nori ,” is particularly important in Japanese culture, as it is one of the main food sources, with approximately 1.8 million tons harvested in 2012 (Rioux and Turgeon, 2015 ). Many records show the application of algae as a food source such as vitamins, minerals, and protein course for humans as well as a feedstock for animal feed (Torres-Tiji et al., 2020 ; Pérez-Lloréns, 2020 ; Anyanwu et al., 2018c ; Rizwan et al., 2018 ; Colla et al., 2020 ; do Nascimento et al., 2020 ; Yarnold et al., 2019a ; Parimi et al., 2015 ; Lafarga et al., 2020 ). Algae are currently listed as GRAS for human consumption. GRAS is a status given by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA to any substance, chemical, or whole organism that is deemed safe for human consumption. The first way to obtain GRAS is by several years of documented consumption that illustrates there are no adverse negative effects on humans. The second is support from scientific evidence proving a substance is safe for human consumption (Torres-Tiji et al., 2020 ). In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is responsible for assessing the safety of any new food and feed compounds before they are produced and commercialised (Lõhmus and Balbus, 2015 ). In Africa, Nigeria, as an example, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration Control (NAFDAC) regulates the control of food product manufacturing, exportation, importation, distribution and sale (Zabaglo et al., 2016 ). Not all algae are GRAS certified, as some species, such as Pseudo-nitzschia pseudodelicatissima  can cause life-threatening food poisoning (Zabaglo et al., 2016 ). While these poisonous algae are not directly consumed, their toxic effects are introduced into the food chain from other aquatic food sources such as shellfish. Often, shellfish food poisoning results from the consumed microalgae that are present inside the gut, and not the shellfish itself. Some certified products and algae include β-carotene from Dunaliella , and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from Crypthecodinium cohnii . When compared with macroalgae, both Chlorella  and Spirulina  (microalgae species) are most commonly sold as food supplements in the USA and in the European Union (EU) (Lõhmus and Balbus, 2015 ). In contrast to seaweed, microalgae consumption has been restricted to a few species, as many species accumulate toxins (Torres-Tiji et al., 2020 ). A limited number of microalgae species have GRAS status as recognised by the FDA. These include: Arthrospira platensis , Dunaliella bardawil , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Chlorella vulgaris , Auxenochlorella protothecoides , and Euglena gracilis  (Torres-Tiji et al., 2020  ). Prokaryotic microalgae such as Nostoc  spp., Arthrospira  spp., Anabaena  spp., and Aphanizomenon  spp. have been part of the human diet for thousands of years (Pérez-Lloréns, 2020 ). General economic growth is not often sufficient to eradicate poverty and hunger. Therefore, the primary way to end the cycle of poverty and hunger by 2030 requires targeted alternative cheap food sources like algae. In addition, several agricultural strategies highlighted by (Otekunrin et al., 2019 ) are as follows:i) Hunger-related issues “especially, children from developing countries”, such as underweight, malnutrition, and mortality, are being addressed through agricultural productivity and nutrition-related treatments.  ii) The amount explicitly designated for poor farmers in terms of access to resources such as land and technology,  iii) The degree to which food prices are lowered through technological innovations.    For microalgae to be considered as a potential food source, some crucial factors such as growth rate, composition, digestibility, and nutritional content should be considered. Microalgae productivity can be up to 20-times that of traditional oilseed crops on a per-hectare basis, making it a more viable and sustainable alternative (Anyanwu et al., 2018a ). There are still other benefits that include carbon capture and wastewater management. The fibers of algae are softer than those of land vegetables. Consequently, they are suitable for intestinal regulation; thus, more production should be encouraged worldwide. A summary of the top algae produced worldwide for human consumption by tons/dry weight is shown in Table 1  . Also, algae will play in mitigating poverty and hunger are good sources of vitamins compared to spinach. Nori  algae is one of the few foods high in vitamin B12 and six other B vitamins (Awake!, Delicious Ways to Sample Seaweeds , 2021 ) and vitamin K (Tarento et al., 2018 ). Algae minerals and vitamins are also important for the health of vegetarians (Wang et al., 2019 ). Algae are served in 21 % of Japanese meals, and the daily consumption is up to 5.3 g per day in Japan (Alves et al., 2019 ). The most popular types are wakame , nori , and kombu . The simplest way to try wakame  is to toss it into salad or soup. Soak them in water, rinse away the salt, cut them into small pieces, and toss them in. Marinated seaweed is said to be added to cooked rice or other dishes (Awake!, Delicious Ways to Sample Seaweeds , 2021 ). One of the major factors responsible for the current hunger and poverty situations is the poor awareness or the total lack of awareness of the nutritional contents of algae. Algae cultivators gain money from algae products. Countries located within tropical Latin America, the Caribbean and most of Africa, typically ignore seaweeds as a food source, with limited to no cultivation systems reported for any purpose (Radulovich et al., 2015 ). Given the all-encompassing benefits of algae, it will be recommended for the governments to evaluate microalgae as a sustainable food source. This would provide a stable food source to reduce the number of hungry people and bring economic stability to the most poverty-stricken regions. Furthermore, governmental policies to support the awareness of the expansion of algae by endorsing and approving all relevant algae as a source of food, especially in regions where microalgae are not currently used as food or feed source, could be a strategic approach to decreasing hunger by 2030 according to the UN SDGs. Integrating microalgae into SDG 1 and SDG 2 may serve at least three main benefits for the people:i) They will cultivate their foods,  ii) They will harvest and prepare their foods, as they do not require expensive equipment, fresh water, and procedures, and,  iii) They will sell their products which will translate to income generation, thereby an excellent strategic role that microalgae could play in reducing hunger and poverty.    Food supplementation using microalgae would alleviate the strain on intensive farming and the resource demands of expensive terrestrial food crops. Therefore, if algae are used as a good food source, they can contribute significantly to the SDGs. Moreover, supporting research to identify more microalgae without toxins for human consumption would be a further step to achieving these SDGs.  3.2 Goal 3 good health and wellbeing Microalgae, along with their high-value extracts, represent a huge source of bioactive compounds (Jacob-Lopes et al., 2019 ), as shown in Fig. 2  . For good health and well-being, it is recommended to have a balanced diet containing high levels of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, PUFAs, and others (Koyande et al., 2019 ). As discussed in the preceding subheading, microalgae contain vital nutritional components for good health and well-being. Microalgae-based PUFA is an alternative to fish oil containing little or no toxin accumulation. It is suitable for vegans as an alternative to animal-based oils, including a higher amount of omega-3 as well (Katiyar and Arora, 2020 ). For example, Isochrysis galbana  and Phaeodactylum tricornutum  produce 22.6 % and 29.8 %, respectively, in terms of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Crytthecodinium cohnii  produce 51.12 %, nearly ≥6 times higher DHA than cod-liver oil at 9.2 %, and tuna fish at 24.56 %, according to Katiyar and Arora (2020) . In contrast, terrestrial plant-based PUFA lack EPA and DHA. Thus, microalgae-based PUFA indicates a compatible market for producing food and feed products over fish and plant-based PUFA (Katiyar and Arora, 2020 ; Li et al., 2019 ). Chlorella  species are generally marketed as ‘healthy foods’ acting as a functional food to prevent, cure, and improve common or acute diseases, such as skin conditions and several types of cancer (Koyande et al., 2019 ). Spirulina  and Caspirulan  derived from Spirulina  spp. and N. ellipsosporum  derived from cyanobacteria are regarded as the most notable antiviral polysaccharide providing a broad spectrum of activity against Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cancer, and influenza (Nowruzi et al., 2020 ). Patel et al. (Pruvost et al., 2016 ) reported the effect of Spirulina  supplement in combating HIV in patients over six months. The patients administered with Spirulina  at a dose of 10 g per day showed significant improvements in terms of weight, arm girth, CD4 count, number of infectious episodes, and proteinemia (protein level in blood). Most HIV-infected patients develop abnormalities within the glucose metabolism, which stems from the virus directly and due to the antiretroviral drugs. A two-month study assessed the normalising effect of S. platensis  in HIV-infected patients. The study suggested that the insulin sensitivity in HIV patients significantly improved as patients received 19 g of Spirulina  supplement per day (Pruvost et al., 2016 ). Clinical research studies involving humans have also described the protection of Dunaliella  extracts in relieving conditions such as diabetes and hyperlipidaemia in male smokers (Raposo and de Morais, 2015 ). Spirulina  has been shown to lower blood pressure and regulate blood sugar levels in the body. Spirulina  spp. was recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be included in the diet of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronauts in space because it is an ideal, compact, and safe food for space travel (Koyande et al., 2019 ). Haematoccoccus pluvialis , according to Shah et al. (2016)  is the most efficient microalgae for astaxanthin production, which successfully reduced blood pressure in hypertensive rats. Furthermore, the prolonged ingestion of carotenoids was attributed to a significant reduction in risk for patients suffering heart attacks and strokes (Pina-Pérez et al., 2019 ). Another clinical study found that taking 0.56 to 3 g of Dunaliella  spp. per day provided antioxidant protection and prevented hyperlipidaemia and diabetes. Arthrospira  spp. administration significantly reduced Low density lipoproteins (LDL), blood cholesterol, triacylglycerols, Very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), lipid peroxidation, and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in patients with diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and ischemic heart disease (Le Goff et al., 2019 ). Microalgae can synthesize large quantities of carotenoids that act as accessory colour pigments for food and supplements (Russell et al., 2021 ). The most abundant carotenoids produced by microalgae are β-carotene, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin and phycobiliproteins. The carotenoids from microalgae also possess strong antioxidant properties often absent in synthetic colourants that can be used in several medical applications (Khoo et al., 2020 ), such as protecting cells from free radical attack (Russell et al., 2021 ). Durmaz et al. reported spray-dried Diacronema vlkianum , Nannochloropsis oculata , and Porphyridium cruentum  to ice cream formulation to assess the health benefits and colouration effects. The colour of ice creams was significantly affected by both microalgae specie and concentration, whereby N. oculata  and D. vlkianum  showed more visible effect. The study concluded that microalgae can be added to ice cream to improve colour and functional properties (Durmaz et al., 2020 ). The above studies show that microalgae could contribute greatly to improving health and wellbeing, thereby fulfilling SDG 3. Thus, in regions where microalgae are not used, appropriate policies and dietary guidelines aim at encouraging the use of microalgae to formulate products for use as food, supplements, pharmaceuticals, and other essential nutrients are essential and can be considered next steps.  3.3 Goal 4: quality education SDG 4 pledges to provide inclusive and equitable quality education for all students from all backgrounds and promote learning opportunities for the underprivileged. The SDG quality and learning concern is most challenging for low-income and middle-income countries to achieve. This goal is broadly twofold: access to education and quality-oriented learning opportunities. Thus, these require improvements mainly in teacher reforms (Bruns et al., 2019 ). For example, accreditation requirements in Peru are higher due to exaggerated reform standards to improve teacher quality. This resulted in only 22 % of students enrolling in 2006, prompting the Peruvian ministry to establish an academic standard for admission as a basic framework for increasing attainment and enrolment. As a result, teacher training institutions increased their admissions standards flexibility. Another strategy to achieve quality education is online learning. Considering the current situation with regard to the global pandemic, online education is more important than ever. Online learning or education can impact localisation and achievement of SDG 4, as this will encourage tutors to tailor learning at both local and international levels effectively. To achieve this, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) will remain at the forefront of supporting online and distance education, particularly in facilitating effective teaching of microalgae education programmes and general STEM “science, technology, engineering, and mathematics” subjects. Another critical strategy for realising quality education is implementing Process Intensification (PI) as a key enabling tool. PI applies new technologies/principles to the new or existing processes with a broader goal than simply improving performance and reducing energy requirements. The primary goal of PI is to provide significant improvement, as PI education equips learners with the knowledge needed to develop more efficient and sustainable technologies (Rivas et al., 2020 ). Sustainable technologies such as wind energy and other forms of clean energy require quality education and translate to a clean and healthy environment for all, which aligns with SDGs. There is a need to integrate microalgae sustainability within existing educational routes in a more discipline-specific focus by adding the sustainability subject as a new topic, assignment, case study, module or service-learning project. Similar approaches could include teaching microalgae sustainability as a stand-alone course, as a topic, or as a cross-disciplinary programme, major or minor, within all schools and universities (Onel et al., 2020 ). Students trained in courses or STEM subjects, including marine biology, microalgae sustainability and/or biofuels sustainability, have the potential to be self-reliant and contribute to mitigating climate change and generating incomes, as shown in the discussion relating to SDG 8. The potential next step will be the inclusion of microalgae sustainability as one of the scholarship subjects to increase awareness and access to this course.  3.4 Goal 5 gender equality Gender inequality stifles and obstructs global progress by restricting women's social and economic development within the industry. Despite improvements, full gender equality for all women and girls remains unreached, as according to the UN, women only represent 25 % in national parliaments and 36 % in local government (United Nations, 2020 ). According to the UN, gender discrimination has contributed to significantly fewer opportunities for women to become eligible for promotion in the workplace, along with lower pay compared to men within the same industry (U. Nations, 2019 ). On average, women make up 43 % of the agricultural labor force in low- and middle-income countries. This ranges from 50 % in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia to 20 % in Latin America. Gender stereotypes, a lack of information about value chains, and social restrictions are women farmers' most significant vulnerabilities and constraints (Tanumihardjo et al., 2020 ). Women's empowerment is critical for encouraging women to participate in agriculture, gain access to and control over resources, and adopt new agricultural technologies (Tanumihardjo et al., 2020 ). The United Kingdom has the lowest number of female engineers in Europe. According to research cited by Engineering UK, only 9 % of UK engineering professionals are women. In comparison to 18 % in Spain, 20 % in Italy and 26 % in Sweden. This UK figure needs to be increased. There is an international event to raise women's profile in engineering and highlight all of the exciting engineering career opportunities available to women (e4s, 2020 ). Gender inequality can be addressed by encouraging and promoting women in education to pursue these careers. Furthermore, encouraging STEM studies and careers is one of the most practical fields that enable women to gain meaningful employment by making women skilled enough to earn a living (Akinsemolu, 2018 ). Microalgae sustainability course is one of such. Also, supporting women who have completed their STEM studies into relevant jobs. Future efforts should aim to provide (1) funding to support women and girls in STEM studies and careers; (2) provide strategic policies that would encourage women's job retention; (3) provide incentive to employers who successfully employ women and girls upon successful completion of their STEM programme; and (4) addressing barriers that could prevent women and girls from reaching their full potentials.  3.5 Goal 6 clean water and sanitation SDG 6 aims to ensure accessibility to and sustainable management of water and sanitation (United Nations, 2020 ). Despite progress, municipal wastewater treatment remains a challenge. One of the goals of wastewater treatment is to significantly reduce the amount of organic matter in the water to be safe for human consumption. The nitrogen and phosphorus compounds are removed from wastewater before discharge. The presence of large concentrations of these minerals can have harmful effects on the level of dissolved oxygen, which results in a negative impact on aquatic species. Improving the ecological status of water sources is a growing priority for many developed and developing countries, particularly in terms of lowering the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater effluent (Mohsenpour et al., 2021 ). According to the European Underwater treatment directive, the maximum limit for Chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the discharged wastewater is 125 mg L−1 , while the limitations for total phosphorus and nitrogen are 1 or 2 mg L−1  and 10 or 15 mg L−1  for populations over and below 100,000, respectively (Mohsenpour et al., 2021 ). SDG 6 calls for safe drinking water and sanitation for all. People should be educated about cleanliness and hygiene, community-based complete sanitation, and community health clubs (Alcamo, 2019 ). Water remediation using microalgae is an example of a green technique first used in sewage treatment systems where environmental pollution has been exacerbated by rapid economic growth, particularly in aquatic ecosystems (Li et al., 2020 ). Microalgae can provide wastewater management opportunities through bioremediation. Chlorella vulgaris  and Scenedesmus obliquus  are microalgae strains effective for wastewater treatment (Batista et al., 2015 ). Microalgae are highly recommended for their heavy metal removal considering the environmental advantages compared to conventional treatment. Electrochemical, membrane, ion exchange, chemical precipitation, and flotation are just a few traditional methods used to remove heavy metals from wastewater. However, these techniques have drawbacks, namely, high operating costs, high maintenance costs, secondary pollution produced from toxic sludge and ineffective at heavy metal concentrations below 100 mg L−1  (Leong and Chang, 2020 ; Fu and Wang, 2011 ). It takes a lot of energy and money to traditionally clean municipal wastewater. The use of microalgae for WWT is an environmentally benign and sustainable wastewater treatment solution since it removes contaminants while producing important biomass (Kotoula et al., 2020 ; Daneshvar et al., 2018 ). Represents of scavenging mechanisms of contaminants by microalgae are illustrated in Fig. 3   (Markou et al., 2018 ). Because of its very harmful contaminants and its eutrophication risks, wastewater, often known as swine, is a serious hazard to the environment and public health. The phytoremediation of swine wastewater may be improved through microalgae cultivation. This is due to the high tolerance microalgae have towards high ammonia levels that are attributed to swine wastewater (Nagarajan et al., 2019 ). Conversely, due to the high amount of nutrients suitable for microalgae growth, this is an excellent source for microalgae cultivation. The harvested microalgae biomass elicits high potential for conversion to valuable bioenergy (Cheng et al., 2019 ), such as biogas (Prandini et al., 2016 ), recovery of useful nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) during microalgae cultivation for enhanced biomass and lipid productivity (Sandefur et al., 2016 ), biomethane production (Perazzoli et al., 2016 ), or biobutanol production (Wang et al., 2017 ). Industrial, home, and agricultural sewages can all be treated with various microalgae. BOD, nitrate, and phosphate from paper mill effluent treated with Scenedesmus  recorded removal at rates as high as 82, 65, and 71.29 % with this technology (Li et al., 2020  ). Xueqing and colleagues examined pre-treatment with chlorella for treating salty antibiotic wastewater containing Amoxicillin (AMX) (Shi et al., 2018 ). Under autotrophic conditions, Chlorella spunique 's carbon source metabolic pathways were revealed using the Biologic EcoPlate test. Using a treatability test, Chlorella  sp. was found to successfully remove AMX (>99 %) at initial AMX concentrations of 10 to 150 mg L−1  (Shi et al., 2018 ). It was found that Chlorella sorokiniana  and Macrophyte lemna  might be used for wastewater treatment. TDN, COD, NH4 , and PO4 P elimination was 88 %, 99 %, 90 % and 91 % on average, respectively (Kotoula et al., 2020  ). T. obliquus  can be used to treat aquaculture water, although the presence of protozoa in non-sterile water samples did not appear to have any effect. A microalgae-based solution to remediate aquaculture water was also shown to be a potential contender (Tejido-Nuñez et al., 2019 ). Fluoride contamination of drinking water is a global issue that affects the health of countless numbers of people. Fluoride levels in drinking water should not exceed 1.5 mg L−1  (Berry et al., 2015 ). Fluoride concentration in drinking water can create health issues such as tooth mottling if it exceeds the permissible level. If the concentration is higher above the acceptable range, for example, between 3 and 6 mg L−1 , it might cause skeletal fluorosis (Berry et al., 2015 ). >20 developed and developing countries have found fluoride quantities exceeding WHO limits. As a result of fluorosis (a disorder induced by overexposure to fluoride), countries including Norway, Mexico, India, Argentina, China, and the United Kingdom are among the most vulnerable (Mittal et al., 2020 ). Blue-green algae, such as Phormidium  sp. can be encapsulated and used as a biosorbent that provides a unique sort of biosorbent that continuously creates new active sites for biosorption, which can address fluoride concerns and can be separated easily from treated water (Mittal et al., 2020 ). Photosynthesis produces oxygen in microalgae, and CO2  assimilation occurs in microalgae. In a mutually advantageous cycle, bacteria can utilise oxygen produced by microalgae to oxidize organic carbon, while algae can take up CO2  produced by the respiration of bacteria. Microalgae can be included in wastewater treatment processes to minimize or offset aeration needs and CO2  emissions in this way, whether through retrofit or new plant design. Photosynthetically fixed carbon is absorbed by microalgae together with N and P during growth. Bacterial N and P removal requirements, as well as aeration requirements and nitrous oxide emissions, can be reduced by this method (Liu et al., 2020a ). Rivers and lakes are suffering from a lack of freshwater because of polluted industrial, agricultural, and home waste. Human communities and the economy are at risk because of air and water pollution, particularly nitrogen (N). Fossil fuel flue emissions contain nitrogen oxides (NOx) that pose major environmental and health risks to all living species (Qie et al., 2019 ). N2 O, NO, NO2 , N2 O3 , N2 O4 , and N2 O5  are the main pollutants in the air, accounting for 90 to 95 % of the NOx present (Chen and Wang, 2020 ; Skalska et al., 2010 ). Microalgae are an important part of the solution to pollution by converting inorganic nitrogen fertilizers to organic nitrogen. Proteins, vitamins, and polyphenols could be produced from NOx by microalgae, which has the potential to play a key part in this process. To reduce environmental pollution and produce protein products, flue gas treatment systems may find the microalgae-based BioDeNOX method intriguing (Qie et al., 2019 ). To achieve SDG 6, moving to new directions, such as using microalgae to treat polluted water, is crucial, as this may serve a dual purpose: treating contaminated water, and producing valuable biomass.  3.6 Goal 7 affordable and clean energy Suppose we want to live in harmony with nature. In that case, our energy systems must meet some of society's basic demands at a reasonable cost while also minimizing their detrimental influence on the environment. Electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles are two such examples. Toxic emissions are reduced, climate change is halted, and fossil fuel reserves are replaced with renewable energy sources, all of which qualify these systems as “clean” (Wilberforce et al., 2017 ). Just as electric cars provide alternative solutions, the same is true for microalgae via biofuels (de Mendonça et al., 2022 ). Microalgae are a promising and sustainable form of affordable and clean energy, showing the practicability of replacing “energy crops” with no food conflict issues (Akinsemolu, 2018 ). The European Union's goal is to derive 20 % of its energy from renewable sources, with 10 % coming from biofuels (Rodriguez et al., 2018a ). However, the world's energy system faces two major challenges: the need for more energy and a reduction in carbon emissions. The use of microalgae to produce cheap and clean energy or biofuels is critical in addressing these issues (Rodriguez et al., 2018a ; Anyanwu, 2018 ). Since the world's population and industrialization have grown significantly, there has been a tremendous increase in the use of environmentally friendly energy. Many have declared unrenewable energy sources like coal and oil are unsustainable (Onumaegbu et al., 2018a ); thus, microalgae are potentially a suitable candidate for producing clean biofuels, including bioethanol, biohydrogen, biodiesel and biogas (Anyanwu, 2018 ). The main techniques and treatment processes that have been implemented to produce biofuels from microalgae have been summarized in Fig. 4   (Ganesan et al., 2020b ). 3.6.1 Bioethanol Wood grain and corn can be fermented to make ethanol (CH3 –CH2 –OH) via fermentation. Bioethanol, a colorless clear liquid, is currently being used in fuel cells (Abdelkareem et al., 2020a ; Abdelkareem et al., 2020b ), also it is used in co-generation systems to generate electric power, and produce raw chemicals. In addition to these applications, it is employed as a solvent in the production of various organic chemicals, as well as in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics (Özçimen et al., 2020 ). Because it is biobased and made from renewable resources, bioethanol made from biomass offers an alternative to conventional ethanol made from fossil fuels. It can be used in the engine on its alone, or it can be combined with gasoline. Because of its high octane rating and rapid combustion rate, bioethanol has a greater evaporation temperature than gasoline does. In order to increase the octane rating of gasoline, it is blended in. Bioethanol is preferable to gasoline in terms of its potential efficiency since it has benefits such as a higher compression ratio, a shorter combustion period, and oil-free combustion. Because it is non-toxic, biodegradable, and produces nearly no environmental pollutants, bioethanol has been hailed as a fuel that is both environmentally friendly and sustainable (Özçimen et al., 2020 ; Phwan et al., 2018 ; Singh and Gu, 2010 ). Because of their high carbohydrate and protein content, microalgae are excellent candidates for use as carbon sources in the synthesis of bioethanol. The manufacture of bioethanol might benefit from the addition of Porphyridium cruemtum . Recent efforts to generate ethanol have concentrated on using microalgae as a source of feedstock for the fermentation process (Singh and Gu, 2010 ; Chng et al., 2017 ); this can replace fossil fuel while accomplishing SDG 7, which is of critical importance. The fermentation method has been utilized for the vast majority of recent bioethanol production. In the presence of fermentative microorganisms and under supporting conditions, specifically temperature and pH range, the metabolic conversion of monosaccharides into bioethanol and other by-products is known as fermentation. These by-products can be used in a variety of applications (Phwan et al., 2018 ). Microorganisms such as S. cerevisiae , P. stipitis , Kluyveromyces fragilis , K. marxianus , E. coli , Klebsiella oxytoca  and Z. mobilis  are included in this group of fermentative microorganisms (Phwan et al., 2018 ). Microalgae that store their glucose as starch, such Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Chlamydomonas moewusii , Chlorococcum littorale  and Spirulina  sp., are able to expel ethanol via their cells under anaerobic environments and in the absence of light. The S. cerevisiae  fermentation process was documented, which took place at a pH of 6 over a period of 72 h; the end product was 0.91 g L−1  bioethanol (Phwan et al., 2018 ). At a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius, the research also found that acid treatments (H2 SO4  and HCl 2 N) resulted in a greater sugar extraction efficiency, which was 8.2 % for H2 SO4  and 8.1 % for HCl 2 N, respectively (Phwan et al., 2018 ). In general, there are three primary methods that can be used to produce bioethanol from microalgae. These methods are as follows: (i) hydrolysis and fermentation of biomass; (ii) fermentation in the dark; and (iii) photofermentation (de Farias Silva and Bertucco, 2016 ). These methods revolve around the production of biomass from microalgae in photobioreactors, which is then followed by a series of pretreatment stages that involve the dismantling of the cell structure and the hydrolysis of the biomass. The inclusion of enzymes is often what is required to accomplish this goal. After the biomass has been processed, it is fermented with yeast or bacteria in order to produce ethanol (de Farias Silva and Bertucco, 2016 ). Pre-treatment is done with the intention of reducing the crystallinity of the cellulose and making it more amenable to hydrolysis, which is the process by which sugar monomers are formed. This can be accomplished through the application of acids or enzymes. After the hydrolysis stage comes fermentation, which is the process of turning carbohydrates into ethanol. This step follows hydrolysis. Bacteria and/or yeast are mostly responsible for this process (Sharma et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2020 ). According to the findings of Thangavelu et al. (2016) , the performance and combustion characteristics of alcohol and gasoline blends in four-cylinder (4C) MPFI at WOT were reported. Compared to regular gasoline, it was shown that alcohol gasoline mixes produced a better combustion efficiency. The authors came to the conclusion that the blends with a low alcohol level did not indicate any starting problems or irregularities in the engine's operation. In addition to this, the combustion efficiency of bioethanol in a gasoline direct injection engine was investigated at a number of different blend ratios. They discovered that the addition of ethanol changes the evaporation properties of the fuel mix, which results in an increase in the vapor pressure for low blends and a reduction in the heavy fractions for high blends. Additionally, the presence of oxygen within the ethanol fuel molecule adds to a quicker flame speed, resulting in increased combustion start and stability and enhanced engine efficiency. The manufacture of bioethanol from Scenedesmus  sp. was carried out by Sivaramakrishnan and Incharoensakdi (2018) , who achieved a methyl ester yield of 92 % and an ethanol yield of 93 %. According to the findings of Kim et al. (2017)  bioethanol synthesis may be accomplished with yields of 89.8 % by saltwater Porphyridium cruemtum  (SPC) and 85.3 % by freshwater P. cruemtum , respectively. According to the findings of Shokrkar et al. (2017)  the maximum output of 0.38 and 0.46 g g−1  glucose, which is equivalent to 76 and 92 % of the theoretical values, respectively, was produced with a mixed culture of several species of microalgae.  3.6.2 Biogas Methane (CH4 ) and carbon dioxide are the primary components of biogas, which is a combination. Because biogas is widely regarded as one of the most promising forms of clean energy and it possesses the potential to lessen the growing concerns regarding the consumption of fossil fuels in relation to the energy crisis and climate change, biogas possesses the potential to contribute to the achievement of SDG 7 (Zabed et al., 2020a ; Obaideen et al., 2022 ; Abdelkareem et al., 2019 ). Several distinct conversion processes, such as fermentation, transesterification, and anaerobic digestion (AD), can be used to turn microalgae into biogas (Rodriguez et al., 2018b ). The Anaerobic digestion (AD) process is the cornerstone for biogas production (Rodriguez et al., 2015 ; Thompson et al., 2020 ; Linyi et al., 2020 ). AD is a biological process that has been around for a long time and occurs naturally. The first instance of AD derived from microalgae was documented in 1957 by Golueke and his colleagues employing Chlorella  sp. and Scenedesmus  sp. that produced 0.17–0.32 L CH4 /g VS (VS “volatile solid”) (Hossain et al., 2019 ). The AD process begins with the introduction of organic components, which, once oxygen is removed from the surrounding environment, are subjected to the combined efforts of a wide variety of bacterial and archaeal species in order to produce biogas. After AD, the biogas that is produced predominantly comprised of CH4  at a volume of between 55 and 70 %, CO2  at a volume of between 30 and 45 %, and trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) between 50 and 2000 ppm, water, oxygen, and other trace hydrocarbons. It was discovered that the solid organic residue that had been left over was high in nitrogen (Zabed et al., 2020a ). The percentages of methane yield that are summarized in Table 2   come from the utilization of various microalgae (Alam and Wang, 2019 ). Methane is a gas that is odorless, colorless, and has a boiling point of −162 °C. When it burns, it produces a blue flame. Methane, in its purest form has a calorific value of 39.8 MJ/m3  and can be transformed into a liquid state, making it easier to store or transport. When the biogas is cleaned up, it can be used as renewable natural gas (RNG) (Rodriguez et al., 2015 ). The amount of methane that can be produced by various kinds of microalgae has been investigated (Alam and Wang, 2019 ; Zabed et al., 2020b ; Córdova et al., 2019 ). To increase the amount of biogas that may be produced, pre-treatment methods are an absolute necessity. Generally speaking, pre-treatment techniques can be broken down into the following categories: mechanical (for example, shaking, ultrasound, microwave, and sonication); thermal (for example, hydrothermal and steam explosion); chemical (for example, acid and alkali); biological (for example, bacterial and enzymatic); and hybrid (for example, thermo-chemical) (Zabed et al., 2020a ). The subject of pretreatment has been extensively reviewed by Onumaegbu et al. (2018b) , Rodriguez et al. (2018b) , Rodriguez et al. (2015) , Thompson et al. (2020) , Abraham et al. (2020) , Kendir Çakmak and Ugurlu (2020)  and Linyi et al. (2020) . The chemical pre-treatment process is solely driven by chemical reactions, with the end goal being the disruption of the structure of the biomass. As a chemical pre-treatment, procedures such as acid, alkali, and oxidation pre-treatment have been utilized to promote cell disintegration utilizing microalgae biomass (Onumaegbu et al., 2018a ). Because chemicals are more readily available and less expensive than created enzymes, this is one of the more approachable approaches for doing what has to be done. Similarly, when chemical substances are correctly preserved, they are less difficult to work with since they have a longer shelf life and require less maintenance than enzymes (Phwan et al., 2018 ; Aditiya et al., 2016 ). In addition, the moderate operating conditions required for the chemical hydrolysis of microalgae-based cellulose, which is not connected with lignin, are easier to model than those required for the chemical hydrolysis of lignocelluloses. Chen et al. (2013)  reported that a sugar yield of about 100 % was produced from C. reinhardtii  algal starch while it was being treated by 1.5 % hydrochloric acid. On the other hand, an alkaline treatment (0.75 % NaOH, 120 °C, and 30 min) was employed to create sugar from C. infusionum . This treatment resulted in the highest glucose production, which was 0.35 g of sugar per gram of algal biomass. To increase the amount of lipids that may be extracted from microalgae biomass, combined pre-treatments are utilized. They are typically more effective than using a single strategy (Onumaegbu et al., 2018a ). Combining several types of pre-treatment would result in a greater amount of soluble material and reduce the energy needed for the total process (Kumar et al., 2017 ). Such systems include the milking process that aims to mitigate the dewatering stage by combining the cultivation and extraction process and performing the extraction under wet conditions. Rodriguez et al. (2018a)  reported Dunaliella  sp. autoclave and chemical (H2 SO4 ). The autoclave was carried out at 121 °C, 1 % H2 SO4 , 121 °C, and 15 min. Co-digestion of microalgae is one more method that can be used to increase the generation of biofuels. Co-digestion refers to the utilization and digestion of a homogeneous combination of biomass in AD to achieve comparatively larger methane yields with improved conversion efficiencies (Perazzoli et al., 2016 ). The conventional digesting processes can't compete with this improved method in terms of economic viability and ease of management (Rodriguez et al., 2018a ; Zabed et al., 2020a ). Compared to the traditional method of biorefining, which involves the purchase of fuel, the production of biogas within an integrated biorefinery can achieve a positive energy balance while also providing improved economic viability. It is possible to integrate the generation of microalgae biogas with the manufacture of bioproducts derived from microalgae, with the operation of other biorefineries based on biomass, and with the treatment of wastewater (Zabed et al., 2020a ; Hossain et al., 2019 ). In addition, recycling the whole volume of water produced by each batch of microalgae will assist in reducing the amount of nutrients necessary for the system to function properly, as well as the amount of fresh feed that must be added (Hossain et al., 2019 ). A low-cost electricity generating facility from bioethanol is recommended to be integrated within the proposed plant. This will allow heat and electricity to be used for the technological stages without importing energy from other sources (Hossain et al., 2019 ).  3.6.3 Biodiesel Producing fuel that is sustainable and less harmful to the environment, like biodiesel, is necessary to preserve the quality of the natural world and ensure the continuation of human civilization (Inayat et al., 2019 ; Ershov et al., 2022 ). The generation of biodiesel from microalgae is a relatively new technology that was developed primarily to provide a fuel that is commercially viable (de Jesus et al., 2020 ; Nassef et al., 2019 ). Under specific operation conditions, numerous microalgae species have demonstrated their capacity to preserve a sizeable number of lipids, with levels ranging from 20 to 50 % of the total dry cell weight. Conditions that induce stress, such as a lack of nitrogen, have shown a great increase in the amount of lipids produced by organisms (Anyanwu et al., 2018c ; Kim et al., 2019 ). Microalgae lipids, much like other feedstocks for the generation of biodiesel, such as vegetable oils and animal fats, have a high viscosity and are, therefore, unsuitable for direct use in modern diesel engines. To create biodiesel, the lipids that have been extracted first need to go through further conversion steps, such as transesterification. The chemical process known as transesterification transforms oils, fats, or lipids into biodiesel which has qualities that are suitable for use in diesel engines (Bi and He, 2020 ). Transesterification is the traditional method for producing biodiesel, which is combined with edible vegetable oils during production. However, because of issues with food security worldwide, oils generated from food sources cannot meet the requirements for large-scale biodiesel production. As a result, it is required to explore novel renewable resources that cannot be consumed (Patel et al., 2017 ). However, more recently, due to the expensive process of drying and oil extraction, major attention has been brought to the possibility of immediate utilization of collected microalgae through in situ or direct transesterification (Polakovičová et al., 2012 ; de Jesus et al., 2020 ; Kim et al., 2019 ; Chen and Lee, 2018 ). In addition, biodiesel has been extracted from microalgae using environmentally friendly solvents. This is one of the most promising alternatives when compared to the use of hexane and chloroform, which are both involved with environmental problems. This is the case because some of it evaporates and is then discharged into the air, and the residue containing these solvents, when burned, represents significant environmental hazards. Studies have demonstrated that using the green solvent Cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) to extract biodiesel from microalgae has a high potential and complies with the quality criteria of Europe and North America (de Jesus et al., 2019 ). It has been discovered that biodiesel that is made from microalgae has features that are comparable to those of diesel that is derived from petroleum. These properties include density, viscosity, flash point, cold filter plugging point, solidifying point, and heating value. Most of these characteristics agree with the standards set forth by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) regarding the quality of biodiesel (Satputaley et al., 2017 ; Ahmad et al., 2011 ). Table 3   presents the chemical and physical characteristics of microalgae oil isolated from Chlorella protothecoides  and microalgae oil methyl esters, diesel fuel, and ASTM criteria for biodiesel. The research by de Jesus et al. (2019)  showed that the purified biodiesel had a purity level that was >96.5 %, and the purities obtained with CPME were extremely similar to those obtained with hexane. Another study by Jesus et al. revealed that 2-MeTHF: isoamyl alcohol (2:1 v/v) may be able to replace the chloroform: methanol system currently being utilized; nevertheless, the high cost is the primary limitation for its use in industrial applications. In another piece of research, researchers evaluated traditional and environmentally friendly methods of lipid extraction, utilizing n-hexane and MeTHF as the two solvents in their analysis. Because of its capacity to dissolve triglycerides, the researchers demonstrated that MeTHF is an excellent candidate to take the place of hexane as a solvent. When compared to maceration, green extraction obtained a higher yield of by-product extraction (approximately 6 % as opposed to 4 %), and it did so in a shorter amount of time (30 min as opposed to 8 h) than the Soxhlet technique (Ben-Youssef et al., 2017 ). During the extraction process, using methanol and sulfuric acid from Scenedesmus quadricauda  sp. was shown by Onumaegbu et al. (2018b)  to have the potential to increase the efficiency of producing microalgae lipid yield for biodiesel production as an alternative renewable resource to reduce the global effect of fossil fuels.  3.6.4 Biohydrogen Hydrogen is a zero‑carbon alternative energy carrier that is extremely energy dense and possesses clean-burning qualities (Abdelkareem et al., 2022 ; Olabi et al., 2021 ; Rezk et al., 2019 ; Nassef et al., 2022 ). The synthesis of biohydrogen by microalgae has the potential to significantly cut the emissions of greenhouse gases that are connected with production (Nagarajan et al., 2016 ). This is because when it is burned, it does not produce any harmful byproducts and instead produces pure energy. At the moment, hydrogen is produced either through the steam reforming of methane or through the electrolysis of electricity, both of which can depend on fossil fuels (Show et al., 2019 ). Methane reforming accounts for 48 % of the total hydrogen produced at the commercial scale, followed by oil/naphtha reforming at 30 %, coal gasification at 18 %, and water electrolysis at 18 % (3.9 %). According to Singh et al. (Singh and Das, 2020 ), these technologies have several drawbacks in terms of the socioeconomic and environmental contexts in which they operate. Biohydrogen production from microalgae has been shown to have a significant promise for the generation of clean and sustainable energy because the process requires less energy and is friendlier to the environment (Singh and Das, 2020 ). When compared to other well-known fuels, such as methane (56 kJ g−1 ), natural gas (54 kJ g−1 ), and gasoline (47 kJ g−1 ), hydrogen has the highest energy density (142 kJ g−1 ) (Jiménez-Llanos et al., 2020 ). In addition, hydrogen may be utilized directly in a fuel cell to produce electricity with a very high-efficiency level (de Jesus et al., 2019 ), as seen in Fig. 5  . The first experiments with producing biohydrogen from microalgae were carried out in the 1930s (Show et al., 2019 ) using light-driven biophotolysis and photofermentation. Biohydrogen microalgae strains include Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , Chlorella  sp., Scenedesmus obliquus  (Show et al., 2019 ; Jiménez-Llanos et al., 2020  ), Acutodesmus obliquus  (Singh and Das, 2020 ), and others as shown in Table 4  . The production of hydrogen by microalgae can be broken down into three primary processes: (i) light-dependent photolysis of water; (ii) light-independent process, which includes dark fermentation using microalgal biomass as a feedstock; and (iii) gasification (Nagarajan et al., 2016 ). The synthesis of hydrogen from microalgae using the gasification route may offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to the creation of biohydrogen. On the other hand, reactive flash volatilisation (RFV), a low-temperature alternative to gasification, gives the potential for the synthesis of biohydrogen. The RFV process for microalgae is carried out at temperatures ranging from 550 to 650 °C, with steam serving as the gasifying agent. Because of this, it is no longer necessary to completely dehydrate the microalgae before using them. This results in a large reduction in the amount of energy that is needed for the dehydration and drying of the microalgae (Gholkar et al., 2021 ). Batista et al. (2015)  investigated the production of biohydrogen yield obtained for S. obliquus  which was 56.8 mL H2 /gVS. Liu et al. (2013)  investigated biohydrogen production utilizing Chlorella vulgaris  as feedstock, via dark fermentation, their results show the feasibility of H2  production of 1276 mL L−1 , a H2  production rate of 240 mL L−1  h−1 , and a H2  yield of 0.94 mol/mol sugar. In another study, biohydrogen from diluted hydrolysate showed a high energy conversion and methane yield of 15.9 kJ gSV−1  (Carrillo-Reyes and Buitron, 2016 ). Under sulfur-deprived conditions sealed C. sorokiniana , hydrogen content in the mixture gas injected in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell was converted into electricity. The generated voltage and current were measured and found to agree with the fuel cell's characteristics (Chader et al., 2011 ). Two-stage anaerobic fermentation of Chlorella  sp. using hydrothermal treatment produced 5.15 ± 0.16 mL H2 /gVS (Markou et al., 2018 ). Although efficient pre-treatment and fermentation processes are increasing, accurate energy and techno-economic studies are the keys to the feasibility of biohydrogen development from microalgae at a large scale (Salakkam et al., 2021 ). Microalgae production and valorisation of microalgae products can act as a platform for a circular bioeconomy, thus circulating resources as well as waste in a closed-loop system (Kapoor et al., 2020 ). The production of biofuels such as bioethanol, biogas, biodiesel, and biohydrogen presents a secure future for the sustainable and environmentally safe replacement of existing fossil fuels and reducing harmful emissions. This is because these biofuels can be made from renewable resources. In addition, the by-products that result from the manufacture of biofuels are valuable in their own right, and the creation of more effective processing and pre-treatment technologies can be yet another source of value addition. One such example is digestate, which is currently considered more of a waste product in terms of fuel but is helpful as a soil fertilizer (Kapoor et al., 2020 ). According to Olabi et al. (2020) , despite the gains that have been made in the clean energy sector, there is still room for development in terms of pledges made by all of the industry's players.   3.7 Goal 8 decent work and economic growth Goal 8 of the SDGs aims to lower unemployment while simultaneously increasing labour productivity and overall economic growth. After reaching a six-year low of 3.2 % growth in 2016, the global economy increased by 3.6 % in 2017, as reported by Dodd et al. (Dodd et al., 2019 ). However, future growth is projected to remain below 4 % because economic activity has returned to normal in most of the world's major economies in the absence of strong stimulus and because fixed investment has remained at a moderate level. In addition, the analysis reveals that it is anticipated that the overall number of unemployed will remain higher than 192 million in 2018 (U. Nations, 2018 ), illustrating a struggling economy on a global scale and low wages for employees in all regions of the world. The unemployment rate will stay high, it will be more difficult to find jobs of sufficient quality, and the majority of unemployed people will be women (Akinsemolu, 2018 ). The primary objective of SDG-8 is to increase employment opportunities for marginalized populations, such as low-income and jobless urban residents, rural people, and women (U. Nations, 2019 ). However, because of the ongoing pandemic around the world, it is anticipated that the number of people without jobs would increase. As was mentioned in the preceding sections, the adoption of green technology and the production of microalgae can both be immensely benefited from the use of microalgae. The end result of this would be an expansion of the infrastructure for research and development, the promotion of the manufacture of biofuels, and the creation of byproducts that would enable individuals to make a living for themselves. One participant articulated that decent work meant individuals have “some control over the place and circumstances in which they work” (Dodd et al., 2019 ). The number of people working in Lower Saxony has expanded significantly as a result of employment prospects in biogas generation and related industries both upstream and downstream. These employees enjoy a high degree of flexibility and control over their work lives (Guenther-Lübbers et al., 2016 ). In Bangladesh, biogas fuel has been shown to be a source of cooking fuel. It is favoured as it does not generate harmful gas emissions and thus improves the quality of health within the household. In addition, biogas could lessen our reliance on traditional sources of fuel, which would be beneficial for preserving natural resources (Chakrabarty et al., 2013 ). People who live in agricultural areas have the opportunity to find work through the production of bioethanol (Özçimen et al., 2020 ). In addition, the development of these environmentally friendly and sustainable technologies, as well as investments, promotions, and the execution of policies, all have the potential to generate income. In sub-Saharan Africa, it has been discovered that biogas stoves, typically used for cooking, have a poor efficiency rate. In order to derive the maximum benefit from renewable energy sources, these issues need to be resolved, and eco-friendly production technologies must be utilized to make efficient and effective products (Akinsemolu, 2018 ). Decent work agenda is unsustainable if it neglects persistent gender inequality globally (Rai et al., 2019 ). Finally, the main advantages of the provision of decent jobs are the reduction of poverty SDG 1 and hunger SDG 2 through the increase of income in isolated, deprived areas, and for women.  3.8 Goal 9 industry, innovation and infrastructure The primary objective of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 is based on the necessity of environmentally friendly products and greener industrial processes. Within the palm oil mill, co-cultivation of microalgae resulted in innovative waste remediation, renewable biofuel generation, high-value bio-compounds manufacturing, and value-added biomaterials. All of these benefits were recorded (Abdullah and Hussein, 2020 ), as can be seen in Fig. 6  . For instance, the co-digestion of Chlorella  sp. with the empty fruit bunches of oil palm has daily produced 5.29 L CH4  per litre of palm oil mill effluent in addition to a high removal efficiency of COD (98 %), BOD (95 %), TN (78 %), and TOC (78 %) from wastewater. Chlorella  sp. has also been shown to be effective in reducing TN levels by 78 % (Ahmad et al., 2014 ). Additionally, the co-cultivation of Nannochloropsis oculata  with empty fruit bunches results in the production of a large amount of biomethane (4.61–5.02 L CH4 /day), in addition to a high removal efficiency of COD (90–97 %), BOD (84–98 %), and TOC (65–80 %) from wastewater (Ahmad et al., 2015 ), whereas the co-cultivation of N. oculata  and Chlorella  sp. with empty fruit bunches yields daily a biomethane output of up to 4.65 L L−1  palm oil mill effluent, the amount of biomethane that can be produced is limited by the amount of empty fruit bunches (Ahmad et al., 2016 ). In the field of biomaterials, biosorbents based on Ceiba pentandra  have been produced to achieve high removal efficiency (97.7–99.4 %) of Pb(II) from an aqueous system which can be recycled five times in adsorption/desorption cycles (Daneshfozoun et al., 2017 ). A photobioreactor has been used to cultivate Tetraselmis suecica , N. oculata , P. lutheri  and Isochrysis galbanahas , which has achieved significant high lipid (31.6–42.2 %) and biomass (0.62–0.96 g L−1 ) content (Shah and Abdullah, 2018 ). In the sector of biopharmaceuticals, marine algal bioactive compounds can be produced as therapeutic drugs (Abd El-Hack et al., 2019 ). Microalgae have attracted much attention in nanobiotechnology due to the use of various microalgal species for producing platinum, iron, gold, silver and palladium nanoparticles. Two routes have been suggested; extracellular and extracellular. The latter route is preferable owing to the ease of separating the developed nanoparticles, while the intracellular route's main advantage is the high yield (Adelere and Lateef, 2021 ). Also, the microalgal compounds and extracts such as silver nanoparticles recorded great results in theranostics applications and cancer therapy. The phospholipids that extract from microalgae are used to develop liposomes, resulting in the integration of the omega-3 fatty acids and hydrophobic compounds and could improve the docosahexaenoic acid sorption resulting in decreasing in hepatic fibrosis and cholesterol (Lawlor et al., 2017 ). Green water applications, a multitrophic integrated aquaculture system, can achieve environmental and economic sustainability by cultivating algae with other biofilter organisms such as sponges and bivalves. These systems maintain circular flows of nutrients in these closed systems, resulting in water reuse and waste management, saving considerable aquaculture costs. The merits of green water aquaculture are the low maintenance, simplicity, and low cost. The constructed ponds are supported with manure and chemicals to enhance the growth of algal populations that form nutrient-rich biomass. The fish and shrimp directly graze on these developed biomasses, which significantly minimizes the cost related to the reliance on commercial aquafeeds. For example, sand filter-based ponds were provided polychaetes to reuse wastewater discharged from shrimp production ponds. These polychaetes graze on phytoplankton cultivated in the discharged wastewater, providing an efficient harvesting technique to produce algae at mass production at a low cost. This creates a valuable chain including bio-products and shrimp and low-cost water treatment. However, the large-scale integration of aquaculture with aquaponics and conventional agriculture may support the aquaculture industry and the sustainable circular economy (Yarnold et al., 2019b ). Compared to the petroleum industry, the algae-based biofuel industry generates much fewer carbon emissions (13 %) during the production phase (Russo et al., 2012 ). Hence it could minimize the carbon footprint generated by the aviation industry by 85 %. The entrants and exits of the algae biofuel market are represented in Fig. 7  . The trend lines are very similar to other industries: after the invention of the initial technology, a rapid increase in the entrants numbers is observed after a long lead time followed by consolidation and at the end high exit numbers were recorded (Geroski, 2003 ). Numerous innovations may lead to the development of algae-based bio-fuel industry such as: (a): the low cost of microalgae harvesting and transporting compared to that of other biomass (trees and plants), (b): processing of microalgae is easily owning to their relatively small sizes, (c): the micro-algae don't compete with food crops where they use non-arable land, (d): they have a higher oil yield than oil crops, (e): they reduce carbon emission and ultimately global warming since they consume CO2  from harmful flue gasses, (f): they naturally grown in the effluent wastewater causing bio-remediation, (g): transformation from petroleum-based fuels to bio-fuel can be accomplished gradually; additionally it can use the same infrastructure of the petroleum industry. An e-business-based refining, transportation, distribution and marketing system can generate a value chain to encourage collaboration across existing supply chains (Nair and Paulose, 2014 ). Technologies such as indoor closed circuit algae nurseries and vertical algae-growing techniques can support the adoption of algae bio-fuels (I.A.T. Association, 2010 ). The key barrier to the widespread commercialization of the microalgae-based biofuel industry is the production of lipids at a low cost. Numerous companies are making great efforts to minimize the capital and operating costs associated with installing, operating, and maintaining microalgae cultivation, harvesting and conversion systems. However, to compete with crude oil in the international market, the cost of biofuel developed from microalga should be decreased to 10 times its current price (Patil et al., 2008 ). Another challenge arises from the selection of the best strains of microalgae for extracting the oil and processing it into biofuel. Hence, much more investigation is needed for genetic improvements in the characteristics of algae species (Khan et al., 2017 ). On the other hand, microalgae can control solar-driven processes for the production of several natural monomer and polymer feedstocks that can be utilized to produce different classes of biodegradable plastics, in addition to bioplastic-based infrastructure, which can serve as a long-term carbon sink. Currently, the production of 1 kg of microalgae biomass is estimated to cost around 0.6–1€ while most plastic prices are around 1€/ kg; hence high-value bioplastics (e.g., for biomedical devices) should be targeted, while production costs should be reduced. The inclusion of other significant factors such as environmental degradation, health-related costs and the cost of recycling plastic need enhanced regulations, which, if implemented, could significantly accelerate the speed of transition from a linear economy to a circular economy based on bioplastics (Karan et al., 2019 ). Other industries could rely on microalgae cultivation, such as animal feed, lactic acid and plasticizer production. However, the feasibility was economical only in the case of lactic acid and plasticizer production, which are high-value products (Kwan et al., 2015 ).  3.9 Goal 10 reduced inequality Disparities within and between nations must be eliminated for the globe to flourish successfully and sustainably. As a result, SDG-10 has set equality within UNs as a goal. According to the literature, income inequality increased by 11 % between 1999 and 2010. Also, it has been estimated that over 75 % of the population of developing countries live in areas where income is distributed unequally (Xia et al., 2014 ). Regardless of the fact that some countries' economies have grown, urbanization has not been equitable. The need of the hour is to reduce these gaps, with a special focus on women and disabled empowerment. Policies must be developed to ensure that marginalized and disadvantaged persons have equal access to employment, healthcare, and other essentials. Increased targeted research and innovative technology and the related infrastructure will aid in the reduction of national inequities. Science, innovation, and technology are essential to a society's socioeconomic development. Science promotion may be precious to society because it is directly linked to life, health, and advancements in different sectors can aid in preventing disease outbreaks. Furthermore, research in the field of sustainability science is highly integrative, and it can help developing countries overcome their restrictions (Pan and Bos, 2015 ). The exchange of scientists, researchers and students can help these countries improve their scientific strength and international repetition. Biotechnology, with a special focus on microbiology, is vital to human health, life, and food production; it covers a wide range of topics on green and innovative science. Improved food quality and quantity, control of diseases, especially infectious ones, and manufacturing of high-efficient antibiotics at a large scale are some of the world's most pressing requirements. However, bio-products developed from algae during the last decades proved the ability of the algae industry to fulfil these requirements. Globalization is also necessary for giving universal healthcare to everyone on the planet. Improving international commerce can help to develop, and impoverished countries grow their economies while also providing a source of income for locals (Braun and Diaz-Bonilla, 2008 ; Díaz-Bonilla and Ron, 2010 ). Furthermore, algae-based biorefinery can significantly eradicate hunger, improve health, and reduce poverty by providing basic nutrients, particularly to the poor, which contribute to achieving the sub-targets of SDG-10. However, algal production systems and biorefineries actively conserve, maintain, and sustain their marine resources (Singh et al., 2018 ).  3.10 Goal 11 sustainable cities and communities Among the 17 SDGs of the UNs, SDG 11 aims to make future communities and cities sustainable and resilient. Five routes for establishing water/wastewater infrastructure that can reinforce sustainable cities are extracted from the SDG 11 targets: water reuse/recycle, pathogen reduction, energy conversion and enhancement in WWTPs, efficient recovery of biofertilizer from wastewater and minimizing emissions from WWTPs. Utilization of algae in green communities yields minimization of natural resources depletion, a high quality of life, mitigated pollution, a green environment and vibrated economy (Chew et al., 2020 ). Numerous studies have been investigated on the merits of algae for green communities. It was shown that algae are eco-friendly, and they have great capabilities to fulfil the global needs in the long term. Recently, algae could provide huge feedstock to replace partially, or even completely different biomass required for developing of sustainable and clean biofuels. The ability of algae to fix and absorb CO2  provides enormous greenhouse gas reduction. Algae-based biofuels generate excess oxygen as a by-product, therefore increasing the percentage of fresh oxygen in the highly polluted cities, hence minimizes the greenhouse impacts in that city. The chemical energy produced from algae photosynthesis is as high as 4–8 % for microalgae and 10 % for macroalgae compared to that of terrestrial biomass (0.5–2.2 %) (Khoo et al., 2020 ; Vassilev and Vassileva, 2016 ). Implementation of algal-based biofuels are the most green and sustainable action to overcome climate change. Algae don't compete with feeds/foods, also there is no need to change land use. Subsequently, algal-based biofuels could minimize the food versus fuel dilemma. Additionally, algal feedstock is not considerably affected by the fluctuation in food market prices, which guarantees high stability of the prices of algal-based biofuel (Chew et al., 2018 ). The optimum algal species for the efficient CO2  conversion should withstand high concentration of CO2  and toxic pollutants, nutrients limitation and fluctuation in temperature and pH values in addition to possesses high sinking capacity. Microalgae species like Nannochloropsis oculata , Chlorella vulgaris , Botryococcus braunii  and Scenedesmus obliquus  represented potential ability for biofuel production and carbon sequestration (Singh et al., 2014 ). These biofuels are renewable and clean energy that introduce sustainable clean water, transportation and recycling, which support making more comfortable and clean communities and contribute to tackling the global climate crisis. The utilization of algae-based biodiesel proved to be preferable environmentally due to its ability to mitigate GHGs emissions and minimize the harmful impact of global warming. Bioethanol (blends up to 40 %) shows high efficiency in internal combustion engines, where it reduces the consumption of gasoline (by 3.0–4.4 %) and mitigates the emissions of CO2  (by 19–35 Mt/y) (Mat Aron et al., 2020 ). Microalgae-based bioethanol is produced through specific production processes, including biomass cultivation, harvesting, pre-treatment, fermentation and purification (Chia et al., 2018 ). Some species like Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  and Chlorococcum infusionum  represent excellent results in producing ethanol with high yield. Also, other species are recommended for bioethanol production due to their tendency to accumulate starch and carbohydrates in their biomass. Bioethanol production is superior to biodiesel, where the latter consumes more energy in the fermentation process. Additionally, the process benefits the environment, where the generated CO2  during the fermentation process could be recycled as the carbon source for algae (Yaşar, 2018 ). Algae can be used to produce biogas such as methane and hydrogen. Hydrogen is produced from algae using biological processes such as bio-photolysis, anaerobic fermentation, photo- and dark- fermentation or a mixture of them. While methane can be developed from algae via different processes such as anaerobic decomposition, pyrolysis and gasification, then collected and processed under high pressure and temperature (Ravindran et al., 2017 ). Fig. 8  summarizes the potential applications of microalgae in sustainable communities/cities. Non-degradable bioplastics that could develop from microalgae are expected to be increasingly implemented to enhance sustainable infrastructure, including plastic-based building and roofing materials, road surfaces, municipal water, and sewer piping, which develop extended long-term carbon sinks that contribute to CO2  emissions reductions (Carus and Dammer, 2013 ). This could occur by exchanging the petrochemical (fossil)-based feedstocks with green bio-derived resources. For example, bio-based polyethylene could accelerate this transition. This process would be applicable through national and international legislated accreditation resulting in such new infrastructure qualified for carbon credits (Delft, 2017 ). The Green/space ratio is mandatory for human life, public health and sustainable development. Innovation solutions like algae façade reduce the CO2  emissions and releases excess oxygen (Lõhmus and Balbus, 2015 ). The microalgae could be cultivated in a tubular photobioreactor or flat-panel. These microalgae façades consider thermal insulators, adaptive shading, and solar thermal collectors (Talaei et al., 2020 ). The energy exchange between the photobioreactors and the building may adjust the thermal loading in both systems (Pruvost et al., 2016 ). Another study reported that integrating solar collectors and photovoltaic in the algae façade system offers merits to the building's electricity and shading. Also, the façade system introduces different functions to the building, such as heat dissipation, co-product production, and wastewater treatment (Al Dakheel and Tabet Aoul, 2017 ). Although the microalgae façade systems are promising in solving the global climate crisis as they convert traditional buildings into energy-producing factories, they still face various challenges related to algal biofuel production (Chew et al., 2020 ).  3.11 Goal 12 responsible consumption and production Plastic is considered as an essential product in daily life (North and Halden, 2013 ). However, the high consumption of plastics has increased concerns regarding their sustainability. Its production relies mainly on fossil fuel and its environmental impact due to the difficulty in its degradation (Beckstrom et al., 2020 ). Hence, current plastics are not sustainable and encouraging bioplastic production has become mandatory to achieve the SDG-12 (Souza, 2019 ). Another challenge is that starch-based bioplastics are produced using food crops, which overloads the food supply (Sagnelli et al., 2016 ). This challenge can be solved by using wastewater for microalgae production. Other plastics developed from microalga protein include biodegradable sheets, edible films, encapsulations and thermoplastic blends (Wang et al., 2016 ). Novel mixed polyester with a high crystallization and melting temperature has been produced from Phaeodactylum tricornutum  (Roesle et al., 2014 ). Recently, bioplastics derived from microalgae like polyhydroxybutyrate and polyhydroxyalkanoates have gained significant attention due to their biodegradability in addition to their similarity with fabricated polymers in their mechanical characteristics. Thus, these bioplastics are preferable in medicinal, industrial and agricultural sectors (Vassilev and Vassileva, 2016 ) and align with the SDG-12, SDG-13, SDG-14, and SDG-15. Moreover, introducing bioplastics instead of synthetic plastics to the current market reduces the plastic pollutants generated during the manufacturing processes or as a result of inappropriate disposal. Checkpoint is a company producing performance materials from microalgae that have already replaced petroleum-based plastics with algae-based performance materials used in the skies. Similarly, another company, Native Shoes, use foam technology that substitutes plastic-based polymer with ethylene-vinyl-acetate foam developed from microalgae (Zia et al., 2017 ). Other applications of microalgae that support the SDG-12 include organic fertilizers, biogas, protein source, nutraceuticals, pigments, aquaculture, animal feed and feed supplements. Recent studies focus on microalgae's contribution to SDG-12, including cellulose production for textile, medicine, and paper industries, in addition to modifying current and developing novel natural products such as hormones, antibodies, and sterols through synthetic biology (Fabris et al., 2020 ; Barolo et al., 2020 ).  3.12 Goal 13 climate change The biogeochemical cycles of greenhouse gases, including methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide, involve algae in significant ways. Algae play a vital part in these cycles. The main players in global climate change and its repercussions are the gases mentioned above, which are emitted by different human activities and interventions such as industrial processes and the combustion of fossil fuels in power plants and other heavy metals industries. It was found that global warming has increased by over 2 °C since pre-industrial levels, primarily due to increased GHG emissions (Tanaka et al., 2017 ). As a result, SDG13 intends to take immediate action to reduce climate change and its impacts and maintain ecosystem functioning. Through their interactions with a wide variety of biotic and abiotic variables, algae play critical roles in the cycle of elemental recycling. They play an essential role in a wide variety of man-made and even natural systems, including the decomposition and mineralization of organic matter, the management of wastewater and cleanup, agriculture, the generation of metabolites, and the production of biofuels (Bodelier, 2011 ). The reaction of algae communities, which play a role in activities like denitrification and respiration, may alter global variables such as CO2  concentration, precipitation, and temperature. Furthermore, a shift in global conditions profoundly modifies the ecosystem's algae structure, establishing a cycle that exacerbates the problem (Castro et al., 2010 ; Singh et al., 2010 ). Because of the activity of microorganisms, the soil works as a sink for atmospheric carbon levels, a process that is greatly influenced by a slight change in soil microbiota (Gougoulias et al., 2014 ). Organic carbon was detected in soil in a high percentage compared to vegetation and the atmosphere (Smith, 2008 ; Parry et al., 2007 ). Hence, it is imperative to study soil algae's constituents, ecology and function to increase carbon sequestration. This is a difficulty in and of itself, given that most of them are still not culturable. In this context, rapidly evolving techniques such as high-throughput screenings are needed to fully comprehend the diversity of soil microbial and their potential for use in climate change mitigation (Singh et al., 2010 ). The most considerable contributor to global climate change, the combustion of fossil fuels, can be mitigated by using algae as a supply of biofuels or as a contributor of the biofuel production process. Implementation of algae in developing third-generation biofuels presents a clean, economic, and applicable solution for enhancing a sustainable environment. The implementation of these green microbial cultures may contribute to the reduction of climate change worldwide, as well as the reduction of carbon emissions (Singh et al., 2010 ). Utilizing these environmentally friendly microbial communities may assist us in alleviating the worldwide issue of climate change and lowering its negative effects on the ecosystem. Because of the high percentage of chlorophyll in microalgae, they may scavenge 10–50 times CO2  higher than terrestrial plants (Raeesossadati et al., 2014 ). For every 1 kg of algal biomass, roughly 1.83 kg of CO2  is fixed through autotrophic growth (Chisti, 2007 ). Despite microalgae's ability to absorb CO2  from the atmosphere, its low percentage, combined with the low mass transfer coefficient between the culture surface and air, makes carbon a limiting nutrient for biomass growth (Fernández et al., 2012 ). As a result, inorganic carbon supplementation can boost biomass production. Absorption of CO2  during biomass growth in swine wastewater in HRAPs was studied. The introduction of gas containing 7.5 % CO2  resulted in a biomass output of 422 mg VSS L−1 ; on the other hand, controlled treatment, which did not include CO2 , yielded 297 mg VSS L−1 . The study highlighted that CO2  uptake in microalgae development relies on inorganic carbon restriction that is more pronounced under higher temperatures and radiation, promoting photosynthesis (de Godos et al., 2010 ). The HRAP technique assessed CO2  uptake in microalgae culture in primary residential sewage. The introduction of CO2  (99.9 %), a biomass yield of 17 g2  d−1  was attained, whereas, without adding extra CO2 , a yield of 5 g2  d−1  was produced. Since the CO2  concentration in the atmosphere range from 0.03 to 0.06 %, using CO2  emissions from industrial activities as a source of CO2  for microalgae cultivation could be a viable option (Posadas et al., 2015 ). Most microalgae thrive in a high percentage of CO2,  up to 15 % CO2 , which is the typical concentration of exhausted industrial flue gases when SOx and NOx are considered. Even higher CO2  percentages up to 50 % CO2,  provide conditions for CO2  fixation by microalgae (Sung et al., 1999 ). The introduction of exhaust gases needs to be done under control. This is because industrial emissions contain toxic pollutants can negatively affect microalgae growth. For example, SO2  is hydrolyzed in water, forms hydrogen ions, which lowers the pH value, and subsequently restricts microalgae growth (Cheah et al., 2015 ). The production of Chlorella  was investigated during the controlled addition of flue gases discharged from the coke oven. The results showed that the biomass yield was 2.87 g L−1  as well as contribution to the removal of 50 % SOx  and 70 % NOx , with the aid of SO2  (87 mg L−1 ) and NO (78 mg L−1 ) (Chiu et al., 2011 ). The growth of various microalgae species in the presence of gases generated from thermoelectric plants was discussed, including 100 mg L−1  NO and 60 mg L−1  SO2  and. C. vulgaris  and Spirulina  sp., two microalgae, with concentrations of 0.98 and 1.59 g L−1 , respectively. S. obliquus  had 0.68 g L−1 , while S. nidulans  had 0.41 g L−1  (Radmann et al., 2011 ). In conclusion, as compared to traditional techniques of gaseous effluent treatment, the employment of microalgae can maximize the benefit of minimizing the toxicity of flue gas while also generating bio products and biofuel (Nagappan et al., 2020 ).  3.13 Goal 14 life below water The water supply standard is a major issue of concern for both human existence and environmentally responsible development. Runoff of toxins, silt, bacteria, and nutrients into water streams has been caused by increasing urbanization and industrialization. This negatively influences public health and the ecological, aesthetic, recreational, biological, and economic aspects of the water (Sutherland and Craggs, 2017 ). Such effects negatively impact the SDGs-14, mainly focused on prevention or reducing marine pollution (Bodelier, 2011 ) significantly. Hence reducing eutrophication is mandatory for enhancing the ecosystem. Although there are different treatment techniques, ineffective application, poor management or inadequate investments significantly reduce the treatment efficiency. Some kinds of microalgae are capable of accumulating or degrade excess nutrients quickly. Hence, growing such microalgae on an artificial wastewater treatment system could achieve a biological treatment. Periphyton ponds, filamentous algae nutrient scrubbers, and algal turf scrubbers have been tested as potential economic mitigation technologies for water remediation (Mulbry et al., 2010 ). These treatment systems depend on several key parameters, such as frequent harvesting, maximum light exposure, nutrient concentration, shallow water depth and water flow rate (Sutherland and Craggs, 2017 ). A constructed treatment system based on filamentous microalgae removed respectively 5.3 and 1.3 t/year of nitrogen and phosphorus from storm water (Calahan et al., 2015 ). Also, microalgae flow ways were able to remediate nutrients diffused in aquaculture facilities such as shrimp (Mitchell, 2018 ), catfish (Valeta and Verdegem, 2009 ), and oyster (Ray et al., 2015 ) farms. Compared to constructed treatment wetlands, the filamentous microalgae flow-ways are characteristic of higher nutrient removal rates, higher hydraulic loadings, low capital costs, high treatment capacity and microalgae recovery (Hydromentia, 2005 ), which support the SDG-7, SDG-12, as well as SDG-13. Microalgae-based feeds, especially the next generation, provide excellent feed sources for large-scale aquacultures. They are considered the basic feed source for lower-trophic fish and zooplankton, which feed higher-up fish in the food chain; also, they are a rich resource for key nutrients. The algae biomass contains up to 60 % carbohydrates, 70 % oils or 60 % protein, according to species type and way of growth (Draaisma et al., 2013 ). They also secrete valuable hormones, growth-promoting substances, pigments and secondary metabolites that produce natural antimicrobial, immunostimulant, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, which are essential to aquatic animals (García-Chavarría and Lara-Flores, 2013 ). However, utilizing non-arable lands or non-inhibited coastal environments for microalgal farming contribute to the mandatory expansion of photosynthetic production via converting atmospheric CO2  into renewable nutrients; minimize water demands in addition to recycling nutrients by use of wastewater/seawater for food products of high quality. This contributes to the enhancement in the life of human, plants and animals on land and establish the basis for a circular aquaculture bio-industry (Carus and Dammer, 2018 ) and reinforces several SDGs, particularly SDG-1, SDG-2, SDG-12 and SDG-14; it produces eco-friendly value chains characteristic with a low carbon footprint and efficient resources (Subhadra, 2011 ) through coproduction of biodegradable bio-products (Carus and Dammer, 2018 ) while making ecosystem services and healthy diets for the aquaculture industry broadly (Neori, 2011 ). The cultivation system is subdivided into two main categories: open and closed systems. Closed cultivation systems (Fig. 9  a&b), which is also known as photobioreactors, are characteristic with their greater productivity and efficient control of cultivation process conditions, while open cultivation systems (Fig. 9  c&d) are characteristic with simplicity as well as they are more economical than closed systems (Franco et al., 2013 ). The initial and operating costs of small-scale production systems are high as 30–50 % of the overall fish production cost, according to the algae type and cultivation systems. Increasing interest is in substituting these live algae with dried and concentrated algal paste. Replacing live algae with a formulated feed minimized the feed costs of 1 kg from US$221 to US$138 (Yarnold et al., 2019b ). The complete designed diets which is needed for optimum growth of fish are typically composed of carbohydrates (15–20 %), protein (18–50 %), lipids (10–25 %), water (<10 %), phosphorus (<1.5 %), ash (<8.5 %), and essential minerals and vitamins (trace) (Craig et al., 2017 ). Technically, this aquafeed could be entirely produced from algae. Astaxanthin and β-carotene high-value carotenoids, which are widely implemented in aquacultures due to their antioxidants and potent colouring properties, can significantly enhance the value and quality of the farmed fish (Raja et al., 2008 ). Microalgae are an alternative solution to fulfil the global needs for omega-3. Microalgae typically contain eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids up to 20–45 % (Adarme-Vega et al., 2012 ). Their fatty acids play an essential role in immune health, cardiovascular function, healthy ageing, and protection from numerous chronic diseases (Swanson et al., 2012 ). The global need was estimated to be around 1.4 M tonnes/y. The current production is around 15 % of this value, which suggests that the algae could be the key supply-and-demand constraint for human and aquacultural nutrition (Salem and Eggersdorfer, 2015 ). Various algal species such as genera Tetraselmis , Spirulina Chlorella , Euglena , and many others were reported to have antibacterial activity in vivo and in vitro scales towards several shrimp and fish pathogens, causing improvement in survival rates. Also, dietary Euglena  or Chlorella  improve the adaptive and innate immune response and the growth performance of the freshwater fish rohu, Gibel carp, and the giant freshwater prawn by enhancing their biological resistance to the disease-causing bacterium (Aeromonas hydrophila ) (Yarnold et al., 2019b ). Recently, after being genetically engineered, microalgae can secrete recombinant bioactive, such as growth promoters, vaccines, antimicrobial agents and immune stimulators for humans and animals (Charoonnart et al., 2018 ). Thus, they can provide the aquaculture industry with much-needed and low-cost disease management. Moreover, they could minimize the need for intramuscular/intraparenteral injection of vaccines, which are difficult to implement on large-scale juvenile/small fish and are labour intensive (Madhumathi and Rengasamy, 2011 ). Consequently, there is a significant amount of room for improvement in both the variety and quality of oral therapeutic aquaculture feeds based on algae.  3.14 Goal 15 life on land Microalgae can support the solubilization of nutrients and mineralization, enhancing soil quality and fertility. Microalgae can also secrete polysaccharides, hormones, antimicrobial compounds, and other metabolites to promote plant growth (Alam et al., 2020 ; Guo et al., 2020 ). Algae are one of the greens and low-cost sources of biostimulants. These products improve nutrient efficiency, the concentration of nutrients in the soil, quality traits and tolerance to abiotic stress (Rouphael and Colla, 2020 ). These products could be achieved by introducing the entire microorganism or extracellular products of biological organisms (Du Jardin, 2015 ). Several types of algae possess these Phytohormones, types of biostimulants that can significantly affect plants (from germination to fruit budding) through to senescence (Labeeuw et al., 2016 ). Macroalgae are already considered commercial soil additives, in 2019, their market size was estimated at USD$ 950 million, while microalgae which possess similar biostimulant characteristics as macroalgae, are still at the beginning of this field. Biostimulant characteristics of microalgae have been proven at different scales, including seedlings in the lab, hydroponics, greenhouse and open field experiments (Chiaiese et al., 2018 ; Renuka et al., 2018 ). Scenedesmus quadricauda  and C. vulgaris  enhanced root traits in sugar beets, supporting their nutrient uptake (Barone et al., 2018 ). The two algae mentioned above also enhance the biomass growth of the tomato plant in a hydroponics system. Moreover, microalgae produce biologically active metabolites, enhancing the plant's resistance to environmental stressors. Some microalgae can promote the growth of culturable bacteria in the plant rhizosphere. For example, the cyanobacterium Calothrix elenkinii  improved the biomass of rice plants by 4-fold (Priya et al., 2015 ). Microalgae support the defense of the plant against pathogens, where they secrete numerous antimicrobial compounds (Rachidi et al., 2021 ). Green and diatoms algae enhance the quality of soil aggregation, hence minimizing erosion, green alga (Chlorella  spp) raised the concentration of organic carbon (Yilmaz and Sönmez, 2017 ). All of the above results suggest that algae could potentially trap nutrients and subsequently prevent nutrient diffusion to the surrounding water systems, hence minimizing the risk of eutrophication. Algae bio-products don't need land since arable lands, such as agricultural and fertile cropland and the associated production system represent positive impacts on occupation and land. This issue increases public acceptance, and establishing a large-scale microalgae production system doesn't stop agriculture development or food security (Gnansounou and Raman, 2016 ). For example, the required land for oil production by terrestrial plants is estimated to be approximately five times greater than that of algae cultivation (Carneiro et al., 2017 ). Still, there are several challenges to large-scale application of microalgae in agricultural sectors, including selecting efficient strains, high initial and operation costs of cultivation and harvesting (Shen et al., 2009 ), and productivity optimization (Xu et al., 2009 ). Climatic conditions are another challenge where algal industries' establishment require moderate or hot temperature (Pankratz et al., 2017 ). Recently, in Australia and Europe, the implementation of algae as feed ingredients and nutritional food has highly increased, and some resources of federal programs are focused on this area (Wesseler and von Braun, 2017 ; Sheppard et al., 2011 ; D'Hondt et al., 2015 ).  3.15 Goal 16 peace, justice and strong institutions For long-term development, the SDG-16 objective strives to promote inclusive and peaceful communities. In recent decades, violent confrontations have reportedly increased, but homicides have dropped. Prevalence of poverty, illiteracy and inadequate access to food negatively impact children's development (Chilton et al., 2007 ). Food insecurity has been identified as a key contributor to children's mental health (Slopen et al., 2010 ). Hunger and poverty have been connected to societal consequences, affecting around 11 % of households in the USA (Chilton and Rose, 2009 ). Algae are not directly related to peace; however, they consider a key parameter for achieving a peaceful society. Algae-based biorefinery (Fig. 10  ) can provide small-scale businesses that might earn a living. Working gives you a sense of accomplishment and keeps your thoughts from wandering to violence (Cramer, 2011 ). Moreover, relationship violence has been linked to unemployment and the problem of drinking (Cunradi et al., 2009 ). This demonstrates that people's inability to earn a living generates stress and contributes to social unrest. Algae can contribute to the achievement of SDG 16 by: (a) enhancing international and national infrastructure, (b) struggle bioterrorism, (c) applying them as nutrition resources, (d) enhancing environmental conditions and (e) applying eco-friendly technology, all of which lead to societal development as well as the prevalence of justice and peace (Akinsemolu, 2018 ). The algae-based biorefinery industry participates in concerns of peace and cooperation. The availability of algae and their derivatives as food and feed resources can aid in the prevention of food insecurity, which is a driver of violence-related concerns, SDG-16, and the foundation for international and local food production and trade partnerships (SDG 17) (Ho and Goethals, 2019 ).  3.16 Goals 17 partnership for the goals Achieving all the above-mentioned SDGs is impossible without national and international integration and cooperation. The most significant challenges requiring large-scale collaboration are communications and information technology, adequate finance, commerce, capacity building, data assessment, monitoring and compatibility (United Nations, n.d. ). The need for capacity building on trade-related elements of biotechnology is urgent. The benefits of algae-based biorefinery technologies can be maximized if globalization and geographical borders are overcome. This eco-friendly technology must be used to promote social justice and equitable principles (Chambers et al., 2004 ). Bio-refineries should be contributed to the social, economic, and environmental goals of sustainable development, which necessitates policy frameworks. Agriculture, fermented foods, biofuels, and medicinal science are the most pressing sectors that require immediate attention. There is a need for more international policies, researcher interest and collaboration across countries as well as open business. Moreover, developed nations should encourage and facilitate trade with developing nations so that everyone benefits and innovations reach those who need them most urgently. Human and society's development can only be realized via the use of knowledge in microbiological technology and worldwide manufacturing. Regionally significant organizations such as the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Association of Southeast Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development, and the South African Development Committee are already working towards facilitating and securing trade between participating countries. To make globalization more productive, more diverse, bigger, and intercontinental, agreements are necessary (DaSilva, 1998 ). The success of the algae-based business is strongly linked to the sharing of technology, funding, experience, and knowledge between leaders, policy/decision-makers and stakeholder groups. Many enterprises worldwide produce microalgae for research purposes as a resource for various bio-products, as well as to sell to other businesses. On a worldwide scale, the continents with the most progress in this area are Europe and USA (de Mendonca et al., 2021 ). A huge number of dry algae (7000 t/y) are generated worldwide, with a global market of USD$ 3.8–5.4 billion (Souza, 2019 ). These figures show that the microalgae business is gaining increasing interest and will expand broadly soon. de Mendonca et al. (2021)  listed 146 organizations and companies that manufacture or sell a variety of algae-based bioproducts or even species. That data is crucial for determining the status of microalgae in the global market.   4 The contribution of microalgae in the circular economy The circular economy is directly linked to economic production based on knowledge and the help of natural or/and wastes as resources to provide sustainable useful products resulting in saving in natural resources, minimization of wastes, and maximizing the values (Elegbede et al., 2021 ). Kholssi et al. (2021b)  stated that the implementation of microalgae in the industrial sector results in valuable products (Goswami et al., 2021 ; López-Pacheco et al., 2021 ), in addition to managing organic wastes and GHG emissions, as well as contributing to food security (Wollmann et al., 2019 ). For example, an approach using Spirulina platensis  as a template to develop photocatalysts for effective solar water treatment and biofuel production was investigated. The results showed that the microalgae hybrids represented an eco-friendly circular approach to combining water remediation, bioethanol production, and CO2  fixation; it was proposed that the approach could be scaled easily on a large scale (Serrà et al., 2020 ). However, microalga is preferable for a circular economy as they do not need complicated compounds or processes; they require light and essential nutrients. They can be cultivated in wastewater (Mishra et al., 2021 ). Studies proposed microalgae as a promising source of proteins, carbohydrates, polyhydroxyalkanoates and cellulose for producing bioplastics (Madadi et al., 2021 ). Microalgae are also investigated for biochar production. The co-pyrolysis of microalgae and sewage sludge enhanced the final product, which contribute to minimizing the problems resulting from inappropriate or/and expensive management of wastewater treatment sludge (Bolognesi et al., 2021 ). Integrating different processes in the microalgae biorefinery enhances process efficiency, resource recovery, and profitability. On the other hand, cultivation conditions, types of microalgae strains, reactor design, and production of bioproducts have been evaluated (Moreira et al., 2021 ). The findings of the above studies and many others give insight into the current situation and prospective in microalgal-based products considering a circular economy achievement. Microalgal biomass contributes to the production of clean water as well as the development of numerous bioactive compounds, biofuels and biofertilizers for agricultural purposes (Fig. 11  ). However, efficient biorefineries play an important role in reducing biomass production costs, which could introduce environmental benefits and economic production processes that impact a real circular economy (Ferreira et al., 2019 ). The DSP incurs the highest cost within the biorefinery. According to Ruiz et al. (2016) , an economic evaluation predicted that the biorefinery concept is feasible with projections of total revenue of approximately €31 per kg dry weight. This assumes the cultivation and DSP costs are about €7 per kg dry weight. This data is subject to vertical flat panel PBRs in southern Spain. A significant contribution of microalgae in the circular economy will rise from its application in fuel cells which may be implemented in different vital sectors such as residential, transportation, and industrial networks. In this manner, research institutes around the world have endeavoured to make use of the circular economy in addition to commercial businesses all over the world. This developing concern presents a potentially fruitful opportunity for the consolidation of microalgae technology on a broad scale for the treatment of waste, CO2  fixation, and the manufacture of biofuels.  5 Conclusions This study discussed in detail the role of microalgae in achieving the various SDGs proposed by the UNs. Moreover, this study also elaborates on the contribution of microalgae to the circular economy. The results demonstrated that microalgae effectively contribute directly or indirectly to achieving the whole SDGs. For instance, microalgae are considered an excellent renewable and sustainable energy source, especially since they do not compete with food and do not require fresh water for their cultivation. Moreover, microalgae are a potential food source with a high growth rate and low cost of cultivation. Therefore, microalgae could play incredible roles in reducing poverty and hunger (SDG 1 and SDG 2). Microalgae can synthesize large quantities of carotenoids and other natural products; therefore, microalgae contribute positively to improving health and wellbeing (SDG3). Microalgae are already used commercially in producing various renewable energy sources such as biodiesel, biohydrogen, bioethanol, and biogas. Therefore, they are essential in clean energy sources (SDG 7). Several companies are formed to serve the various applications of the microalgae, such as those for producing lipids at low cost and biomedical companies working to improve the quality and the amount of valuable microalgae products through genetic modification. Therefore, microalgae play an essential role in economic growth, industry and innovation (SDG 8, SDG 9, and SDG 12). One of the main advantages of microalgae is that they can be cultivated in large amounts using the CO2  from the atmosphere and wastewater. Therefore, it is an effective CO2 -capturing and wastewater treatment technique. Generally, microalgae play an essential role in green communities as they can minimize pollution, minimize the depletion of natural resources, mitigate pollution, and form a green environment (SDG 6, SDG 11, SDG 13, SDG 14, and SDG 15). Furthermore, microalgae indirectly contribute to quality education, gender equality, and other SDGs (SDGs 4–6, SDG 10, and SDGs 14–17). Finally, microalgae contribute to the circular economy as they do not need complicated compounds or processes; their requirements are light and basic nutrients. Microalgal biomass contributes to the production of clean water and the development of numerous bioactive compounds, biofuels and biofertilizers for agricultural purposes.
