                  Assessing progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is among the most pressing areas for sustainability research. Both international and inter–provincial trade has substantial impacts on sustainability. However, little is known about the impacts of inter–provincial trade on progress towards achieving the SDG targets and the relationships among SDG indicators through time and space. Here we, taking Chinese inter–provincial trade as a study case, used a spatiotemporal approach and the multi–regional input–output (MRIO) model to examine changes in six SDG indicators and their relationships within China in the year 2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017. The results showed that (1) Chinese inter–provincial trade improved the trade–related SDG target scores of 16 provinces out of the evaluated 30 provinces but reduced the trade–related SDG target scores of the remaining 14 provinces. (2) Chinese inter–provincial trade and distant trade were more beneficial for achieving the trade–related SDG targets in developed provinces (e.g., Beijing), which thus improved China's overall SDG target scores. In contrast, Chinese inter–provincial trade suppressed the trade–related SDG target scores of developing provinces (e.g., Guangxi). (3) Individual SDG indicators, SDG target bundles, and interactions among SDG indicators changed across both time and space. (4) The no–trade scenario in Hubei province during the COVID–19 pandemic will have a clearly inhibiting effect on China's overall SDG target scores. Besides, trade with adjacent provinces would improve Hubei's SDG target scores, while these trades have more negative effects (approximately 50–83% of provinces suffered from greater reductions in SDG target scores) on Hubei's adjacent provinces. Our study suggests the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of SDG indicators and their interactions deserve more attention, which can help identify the drivers behind these changing relationships.

Handling Editor: Jing Meng Assessing progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is among the most pressing areas for sustainability research. Both international and inter–provincial trade has substantial impacts on sustainability. However, little is known about the impacts of inter–provincial trade on progress towards achieving the SDG targets and the relationships among SDG indicators through time and space. Here we, taking Chinese inter–provincial trade as a study case, used a spatiotemporal approach and the multi–regional input–output (MRIO) model to examine changes in six SDG indicators and their relationships within China in the year 2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017. The results showed that (1) Chinese inter–provincial trade improved the trade–related SDG target scores of 16 provinces out of the evaluated 30 provinces but reduced the trade–related SDG target scores of the remaining 14 provinces. (2) Chinese inter–provincial trade and distant trade were more beneficial for achieving the trade–related SDG targets in developed provinces (e.g., Beijing), which thus improved China's overall SDG target scores. In contrast, Chinese inter–provincial trade suppressed the trade–related SDG target scores of developing provinces (e.g., Guangxi). (3) Individual SDG indicators, SDG target bundles, and interactions among SDG indicators changed across both time and space. (4) The no–trade scenario in Hubei province during the COVID–19 pandemic will have a clearly inhibiting effect on China's overall SDG target scores. Besides, trade with adjacent provinces would improve Hubei's SDG target scores, while these trades have more negative effects (approximately 50–83% of provinces suffered from greater reductions in SDG target scores) on Hubei's adjacent provinces. Our study suggests the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of SDG indicators and their interactions deserve more attention, which can help identify the drivers behind these changing relationships.

It consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets to be achieved between 2016 and 2030. Recent assessments, assessed by Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), showed that China's sustainable development level is steadily increasing from 2016 to 2021 based on the SDG Index score (an aggregated score that is used to evaluate where each region stands with regard to reflecting the overall sustainable development level) (Sachs et al., 2016 , 2021 ). Since December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019–nCoV, or COVID–19) negatively affected people's health and the economic and social development of China and other 200 countries and regions worldwide (Chinazzi et al., 2020 ; Silvani et al., 2020 ; Su et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2020 ), slowing down the progress made in achieving the SDGs but opening a window of opportunity for sustainable transformation (Pradhan et al., 2021 ; Wang and Huang, 2021 ). In responding to the outbreak of COVID–19, the strategy of " Accelerate the formation of a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international dual circulation (DC) mutually promoting each other” was put forward by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council in time (Liu, 2020 ; Xing et al., 2020 ). It means that efforts should be made to open up all links of domestic production, distribution, circulation, and consumption, give full play to the advantages of China's mega–market, and take satisfying domestic demand as the starting and ending points of economic development. Therefore, inter–provincial trade plays an increasingly important role in redistributing regional resource and satisfying domestic demand (Zhao et al., 2015 ). For example, previous studies have demonstrated that there are abundant water resources embodied in the inter–regional trade of China. Further, SDG 6.4 (ensure sustainable water withdrawals and supply) embodied in China's inter–provincial trade has been investigated in numerous existing studies (Cai et al., 2019 ; Xin et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ; Zhao et al., 2018 ). A common finding is that the virtual water trade in China accounts for about 30% of China's total water use (Liu et al., 2019 ; Xin et al., 2022 ). Quantifying the impacts of Chinese inter–provincial trade on the trade–related SDG targets can avoid the excessive pursuit of trade resulting in overconsumption of natural resources such as water and forests (Labonté, 2007 ; Liu, 2014 ), increase CO2  emissions (Labonté, 2007 ) in some provinces, and exacerbate environmental and socio–economic inequalities between developed and developing provinces (Xu et al., 2020b ). Existing studies mainly analyze the impact of international trade on the SDGs (Xu et al., 2020b ) or quantify China's progress in achieving the 17 SDGs at the national and sub–national levels (Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2020a ; Zhang et al., 2022a , 2022b ). Furthermore, Other studies have shown that understanding the dynamic changes of SDG interactions among the SDGs is key to achieving all the SDGs and finding find specific action priorities for provinces at different levels based on a better understanding of the sustainable development process (Wu et al., 2022 ). For example, most developing provinces with a low SDG Index, alleviating poverty and ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and access to affordable and clean energy should be considered as high priorities because they can positively affect other SDGs. However, no studies have quantified the impacts of Chinese inter–provincial trade on progress towards achieving the trade–related SDG targets and rarely investigate the relationships (i.e., trade–offs and synergies) among multiple SDG indicators through time (Warchold et al., 2021a , 2021b ; Zhang et al., 2022a ). As defined in previous studies (Bisaga et al., 2021 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 , 2018 ; Zhao et al., 2021 ), SDG trade–offs among multiple SDG indicators can be enhanced as an increase of a (set of) specific SDG indicator (s) at the cost of hampering other SDG indicators. SDG synergies within a system emerge when multiple SDGs or multiple targets of individual SDGs in the same system are enhanced simultaneously (Zhao et al., 2021 ). To fill these knowledge gaps, here we assessed the impact of China's inter–provincial trade on six trade–related SDGs that are likely to be affected by trade and for which there are clear measurable indicators for assessing the impacts of trade: SDG 6.4.1 (change in water–use efficiency over time), SDG 6.4.2 (level of water stress: freshwater consumption as a proportion of available freshwater resources), SDG 9.4.1 (CO2  emissions per unit of value added), SDG 13.2 (CO2  emissions intensity of areas under forest management), SDG 15.1.1 (forest area as a proportion of total land area), and SDG 15.2.1 (progress towards sustainable forest management). From comparing impacts of trade and no–trade, distant trade and adjacent trade, and developed and developing provinces, we explored the different effects of Chinese inter–provincial trade on progress towards achieving the trade–related SDG targets based on the multiregional input–output (MRIO) model and scenario–based method. In this study, we defined “target bundle” as a set of targets that repeatedly appear together across space or time. The objectives of this study are to (i) estimate the impacts of China's inter–provincial trade on trade–related SDGs differed between the trade and no–trade scenarios, a distant trade scenario and an adjacent trade scenario, and developed and developing provinces, (ii) analyze characterize the SDG target bundles, and (iii) identify changes in interactions among multiple SDG indicators from 2002 to 2017 across 30 provinces in China over time and across space (see details in the Methods). This study will not only provide a case study for dynamic changes of SDG interactions along sustainable development levels in China but also offer a reference for management action priorities aimed at reducing inequality in trade between developed and developing provinces.  2 Data sources and methods 2.1 Data sources Table 1   shows the principal data name, application, format (including data type, time, and spatial resolution), and data source. This study was based on China's multi–regional input–output (MRIO) tables in 2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017 and the corresponding GDP, water use, water resources, CO2  emissions, land area, and forest land of provincial sectors. China's MRIO tables (30 provincial–level administrative regions, excluding Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) were derived from China Emission Accounts and Datasets (https://www.ceads.net.cn/data/input_output_tables/ ) and refs (Mi et al., 2017 ; Pan et al., 2018 ; Zheng et al., 2020 ). The China's MRIO tables were compiled based on the input-output tables for 30 Chinese provinces that are published by the National Statistics Bureau (Mi et al., 2018 ). All provincial input-output tables were aggregated into 30 sectors because there are 30 sectors in the China's MRIO tables for both 2007 and 2010. At the same time, the raw province–level data on GDP, water use, water resources, and carbon emissions in 2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017 were directly collected from the China Statistical Yearbook and China Energy Statistical Yearbook in 2003, 2008, 2013, 2016, and 2018, published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. The data of the forest area, land area, and forest area in the baseline year (hereafter, the year 2002 as the baseline year) were extracted from the land cover dataset of the China land cover dataset (CLCD) in the year 2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017, resolution: 30 m, http://irsip.whu.edu.cn/resources/CLCD.php . The administrative map, with the provincial–level administration as the spatial unit, was provided by the National Geomatics Center of China websites. All the spatial data were ultimately unified to form the WGS84 coordinate system and the Albers equal–area conic projection.  2.2 Methods 2.2.1 MRIO tables The MRIO tables were used to calculate the virtual water, CO2 , and forest induced by trade (Leontief, 1974 ; Xin et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2020b ). A more detailed description of virtual resource flows can be found in refs (Wu et al., 2022 ; Xin et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2019 ). Supposing an MRIO table with m    regions and n    sectors, the total output of sector i    in the province p    can be calculated using the following equation:(1) x i p  = ∑ k = 1  m  ∑ j = 1  n  x i j  p k     + ∑ k = 1  m  y i p k        where x i j  p k      denotes the intermediate input from sector i    in the province p    to sector j    in the province k   , y i p k      represents the final demand of province p    in the sector i    from the province p   . Eq. (1)  can be transformed into the following matrix:(2) X = A X + ( ∑ k = 1  m  y i p k    )  = ( I − A  )  − 1   × ( ∑ k = 1  m  y i p k    )      where A    is the direct consumption matrix, ( I − A  )  − 1      stands for the Leontief inverse matrix which indicates the total output required to satisfy one unit of final demand. The virtual resource (VR) can be calculated using the following equation:(3) V R = ( v i p  x i p   )  n × 1   × ( I − A  )  − 1   × ( ∑ k = 1  m  y i p k    )      where v i p     denotes the value added of sector i    in the province p   .  2.2.2 Quantification of trade–related SDG target scores We chose the SDG indicators based on the following three criteria: (1) the indicators are linked to trade; (2) the indicators can be quantified according to the indicator description in the Inter–Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG–SDGs); and (3) the data for quantifying the SDG indicators can be obtained from the China Emission Accounts and Datasets. For example, we selected SDG 9.4.1 as one of the quantitative indicators in our analysis, because data were available for CO2  emissions intensity at the province level, and embedded CO2  emissions in Chinese inter–provincial trade can be analyzed through the MRIO model using data from the China Emission Accounts and Datasets. However, other indicators (covering social, economic, and political aspects) under SDG 2.b (for instance, SDG 2.b.1: “agricultural export subsidies”) were not clearly defined in terms of quantification, and their relationships to inter–provincial trade are also difficult to quantify (UN, 2016 ). Considering the above criteria, we calculated trade–related SDG target scores for all 30 provincial–level administrative in the year 2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017 (Table 2  ). The period (2002–2017) covered a phase of rapid development of China's trade. The normalized individual target scores for a given SDG indicator were used the following formula:(4) x ‾  = x − min ( x )   max ( x )  − min ( x )    × 100     where x ‾     represents the normalized individual score for a given SDG indicator; the upper bound (max ( x )    ) was defined as the SDG target scores value located close to the value of the top 2.5th–percentile; the lower bound(min ( x )    ) was defined as the SDG target scores value located close to the value of the bottom 2.5th–percentile. All normalized values greater than the upper bound received a score of 100, and all normalized values less than the lower bound received a score of 0. After normalizing individual trade–related SDG target scores, the weighted average of all six normalized SDG target scores was aggregated to calculate an SDGwa score as the overall performance in achieving all evaluated trade–related SDG target scores. We used a hypothetical no–trade scenario to estimate the impacts of China's inter–provincial trade on progress towards achieving the trade–related SDG targets. The no–trade scenario was calculated by adding the trade balance (exports minus imports) back to the exporting province and then calculating the SDG indicator scores, which generally agrees with findings from other studies (Xu et al., 2020b ). Trade–related SDG indicators under with–trade and no–trade scenarios for each province are quantified and summarized in Table 2 . For details, please refer to refs (Xin et al., 2022 ; Xu et al., 2020b ). We then classified Chinese inter–provincial trade into distant trade and adjacent trade according to the geographical relationships between provinces (see Supplementary Table 1 ), and divided Chinese inter–provincial trade into developed and developing provinces on the basis of the GDP per capita (see Supplementary Table 2 ). We also set up a no–trade scenario in Hubei Province considered in detail due to the COVID–19 outbreak in the province. According to Li et al. (2020) , the average proportion of China's inter–provincial trade covering 28 provinces in China did not significantly change from 1992 to 2017. To be conservative and simple, we also assumed that the average proportion of China's inter–provincial trade will not significantly change in 2020. The COVID–19 pandemic is impacting many sectors of society, such as economy and trade (Wang and Huang, 2021 ). In an attempt to predict the impact of the COVID–19 Pandemic occurred in Hubei Province on trade–related sustainable development continues yet, we define 2020 SDG target scores as the arithmetic mean of SDG target scores in 2015 and 2017. For example, in SDG 6.4.2, we calculated the average SDG target scores for SDG 6.4.2 target scores in 2015 and 2017 as a proxy for SDG 6.4.2 target score in 2020. After obtaining the scores of each indicator, these scores are aggregated into the scores of the corresponding SDGs targets using the arithmetic mean method (Zhang et al., 2022a ).  2.2.3 Spatiotemporal changes of individual trade–related SDG indicator We used the space–time interaction (STI) method given by refs (Legendre et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 2022 ; Wang and Li, 2022 ) to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of each SDG indicator. This method tests for space–time interactions in repeated data, where there are no replications at the level of individual sampling units. In STI, variables of time and space are coded by principle coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) into a two–way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model (Renard et al., 2015 ). A significant result of STI (P < 0.001) indicates that the spatial distribution of an SDG indicator has changed over time. In our study, STI was processed using the package “adespatial” (Cademus et al., 2014 ), “adespatial” (Cademus et al., 2014 ), “reshape2” (Wickham, 2007 ), “ggcor” (Huang, 2020 ), “factoextra” (Kassambara and Mundt, 2020 ) and “ggplot2” (Wickham, 2009 ) in R (version 4.0.5) for statistical computing, setting each STI test at 999 permutations.  2.2.4 Synergies and trade–offs assessment Since the data for the six trade–related SDG indicators (i.e., SDG 6.4.1, SDG 6.4.2, SDG 9.4.1, SDG 13.2, SDG 15.1.1, and SDG 15.2) present different ranges and units in values, we used the ranking method developed by Carr and Zwick (2007)  as the conceptual basis for a ranking classification framework for SDG target synergy or trade–offs acquired stable, comparable, and practical SDG target bundles results more easily (Wang and Li, 2022 ). In contrast to the spatially explicit SDG target bundles approach, which uses cluster analysis to identify groups of regions/provinces/cities with similar sets of SDG target, or SDG target bundle types, the ranking method was based on grid level to better identify the interactions among multiple SDG targets. The major steps of the identification and analysis of the SDG target bundles are as follows: First, in order to use the ranking model for SDG indicator trade–offs, we take the average method of similar SDG indicators to merge the six SDG indicators into less than or equal to four SDG indicators according to the K–means clustering results. For example, we have merged the six trade–related SDG indicators into four SDG indicators under the with–trade scenario and no–trade scenario (Table 3  ), and four SDG indicators under the with–trade scenario and no–trade scenario in Hubei Province (Table 4  ) according to the K–means clustering results. Second, the quartiles (Q1, Q2, and Q3) approach produced three level classes for each of the six SDG indicators, which were coded 1, 2, and 3, representing low (25% of the values are less than or equal to Q1), medium (25% of the values are between Q1 and Q2, and 25% of the values are between Q2 and Q3), and high (25% of the values are greater than or equal to Q3) levels, respectively. Finally, we determined interaction codes (I C   ) by combining the level of the individual SDG indicator into an “SDG target bundle” using the following equation (Cademus et al., 2014 ):(5) I C = B 1  × 1000 + B 2  × 100 + B 3  × 10 + B 4      where I C    is the four–digit code defining the type of interaction; B 1     denotes the first SDG target bundle level; B 2     is the second SDG target bundle level; B 3     stands for the third SDG target bundle level and B 4     represents the fourth SDG target bundle level. The I C    numbers between 1111 and 3333 represented an SDG target bundle for each province and were further classified into provinces where at least two SDG indicators are dominant (i.e., synergy) and provinces where one of the SDG indicators is dominant over the others (i.e., trade–offs) (see Table 3 ). Image processing was carried out using Python 2.7, and ArcGIS 10.2.    3 Results 3.1 Spatial and temporal dynamics in trade–related SDG indicators In Fig. 1  , six trade–related SDG indicators changed significantly (test for the effect of space–time using space–time interaction (STI) analysis) over time (df = 117, P  < 0.001). The SDG target scores increased for almost every SDG indicator (excluding SDG 6.4.2), SDG 6.4.1 by between 22% and 30%, SDG 9.4.1 by between 21% and 73%, SDG 13.2 by between 6% and 10%, SDG 15.1.1 by between 81% and 86%, SDG 15.2.1 by between 89% and 93%, from 1971 to 2006 (Fig. 1 ). The STI analysis also showed that SDG 6.4.1(Fig. 1 a), SDG 6.4.21(Fig. 1 b), SDG 9.4.11(Fig. 1 c), SDG 13.21(Fig. 1 d), SDG 15.1.11(Fig. 1 e), and SDG 15.2.11(Fig. 1 f) were significantly (test for the effect of space using STI) different between provinces at each time step (i.e., 2002, 2007, 2012, 2015, and 2017) (df = 117, P  < 0.001, Fig. 1 ). In addition, the change in each SDG indicator through time was not the same in all 30 provinces. For example, highly significant interactions between space and time for all SDG indicators except SDG 9.4.1 (P  < 0.001) and the standard deviation (SD) of each SDG indicator among provinces showed a trend of increase before decrease through time.  3.2 Impacts of China's inter–provincial trade on trade–related SDG targets under trade and no–trade, distant trade and adjacent trade, developed and developing provinces The impact of Chinese inter–provincial trade on trade–related SDG target scores differed between the trade and no–trade scenarios (Fig. 2  a). 16 (i.e., Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Henan, Ningxia, Guangdong, Chongqing, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Hubei, Anhui) of 30 provinces were the main beneficiaries of Chinese inter–provincial trade in terms of increasing their respective trade–related SDG targets scores, but the remaining 14 provinces (i.e., Fujian, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hainan, Jilin, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Guangzhou) were decreased in trade–related SDG targets scores due to Chinese inter–provincial trade (Fig. 2 b, d, f). Chinese inter–provincial trade improved the score of SDG 6.4.1, 15.1.1, and 15.2.1 in developed provinces, and thus positively affected progress towards achieving all six trade–related SDG target scores at the national level (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Meanwhile, Chinese inter–provincial trade experienced declines on progress towards achieving SDG 6.4.1, 9.4.1, 13.2, 15.1.1, and 15.2.1 target score of developing provinces (Fig. 2 b, d, f, and Supplementary Table 3 ). Interestingly, the impact of Chinese inter–provincial trade on trade–related SDG target scores also differed between the distant trade and adjacent trade scenarios (Fig. 2 a and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). We found that the distant trade improved the SDG 6.4.1, SDG15.1.1, and SDG15.2.1 score of the developed provinces, while the distant trade and adjacent trade inhibited the trade–related SDG target scores of the developing provinces (Fig. 2 c, e, f). Trade–related SDG target score of developed provinces is higher than those of developing provinces in the presence of a distant trade scenario, but the trade–related SDG target score of less developing provinces is not affected by distant trade and adjacent trade scenarios (Fig. 2 e and f). Overall, comparing the trade and no–trade scenarios, the distant trade and adjacent trade scenarios, and the trade on trade–related SDG targets between developed and developing provinces, we found that developed provinces benefit from Chinese inter–provincial trade and distant trade (Fig. 2 d, e, f and Supplementary Fig. 2 ), while developing provinces suffered from greater reductions in trade–related SDG target score from Chinese inter–provincial trade.  3.3 Interactions among trade–related SDG targets At the provincial scale, the relationships among trade–related SDG indicators changed through time, in terms of the type of relationship (trade–offs: r    <–0.1; synergy: r    >0.1; no relationship: 0.1≤ r    ≤0.1). In the case of the Chinese inter–provincial trade scenario (Supplementary Table 4 ), relationships between SDG 6.4.2 and 15.1.1, SDG 9.4.1 and 15.1.1, SDG 13.2 and 15.1.1, SDG 15.1.1 and 15.2.1 showed significant trade–offs varies through time (P  < 0.05), while SDG 6.4.2 and 13.2, SDG 6.4.2 and 15.2.1 showed a significant synergistic relationship (P  < 0.05). In particular, we should focus on the relationship between SDG 6.4.1 and SDG 9.4.1 shifted from trade–offs to significant trade–offs (from a significant correlation coefficient of −0.26 in 2002 to −0.43 in 2017 (P  < 0.05)) (Supplementary Table 4 ). In the case of the Chinese inter–provincial no–trade scenario (Supplementary Table 5 ), the relationships between SDG 6.4.2 and 15.1.1, SDG 6.4.2 and 15.2.1, SDG 13.2 and 15.2.1, SDG 13.2 and 15.1.1 showed significant trade–offs varies through time (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, SDG 6.4.1 and 15.1.1, SDG 6.4.1 and 15.2.1 also showed a significant trade–off (from a significant correlation coefficient of −0.43 in 2002 (P  < 0.05) to −0.16 in 2017) but the strength of this trade–off relationship decreased over time, while SDG 6.4.2 and 13.2, SDG 15.1.1 and 15.2.1 showed a significant synergistic relationship (P  < 0.05). In particular, we should focus on the relationship between SDG 6.4.1 and 6.4.2, SDG 6.4.1 and 13.2 shifted from synergistic to significant trade–offs (Supplementary Table 5 ). Interestingly, the types of trade–related SDG target bundles and their spatial distribution across the scenario settings changed. In the case of the Chinese inter–provincial trade scenario, the spatial distribution of the SDG target bundle was B 1     (SDG 6.4.1, 13.2), B 2     (SDG 6.4.2, 15.2.1), B 3     (SDG9.4.1), B 4     (SDG 15.1.1) (Fig. 3  a, d and Table 3 ). It was found that 43% of provinces were dominated over the others (i.e., trade–offs, the same below) and 57% of provinces where at least two SDG indicators were dominated (i.e., synergy, the same below); however, in the case of no–trade scenario, the spatial distribution of SDG target bundle was B 1     (SDG 6.4.1), B 2     (SDG 6.4.2, 13.2), B 3     (SDG9.4.1), B 4     (SDG 15.1.1, 15.2.1) (Fig. 3 b, e and Table 3 ). It was found that 37% of provinces were dominated over the others and 63% of provinces where at least two SDG indicators were dominated. Compared with the Chinese inter–provincial trade and no–trade scenarios, trade in Shanxi, Jilin Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Guizhou, and Ningxia experienced improvements in trade–related SDG targets scores and thus shifted from trade–offs to a synergistic relationship, while trade in Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Guangdong, Gansu exacerbated the trade–offs of trade–related SDG indicators. In addition, trade in Hubei province shifted from SDG 6.4.2/15.2.1 trade–offs to SDG 9.4.1 trade–offs. In short, the temporal dynamics that shifted from synergy to a trade–off, from a trade–off to a significant trade–off, and from one trade–off to other trade–offs deserve more attention (Supplementary Table 6 ).  3.4 No–trade scenario in Hubei Province considered in detail due to COVID–19 outbreak We found that the no–trade scenario in Hubei Province led to decreases in all six trade–related SDG target scores (Fig. 4   and Supplementary Table 7 ). Specifically, the values of SDG 6.4.1, 6.4.2, 9.4.1, 13.2, 15.1.1, and 15.2.1 metrics decreased by 77%, 53%, 83%, 50%, 53%, and 57% of the provinces, respectively (Fig. 4 a), and the composite SDG target score (using the weighted average method) of trade–related six SDG indicators decreased by 97% of the provinces (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). It can be recognized that the no–trade scenario in Hubei Province has a strong inhibiting effect on the progress towards achieving multiple SDG targets at the national levels. In the case of the no–trade scenario in Hubei Province, relationships between SDG 6.4.2 and 15.1.1, SDG 6.4.2 and 15.1.1, SDG 13.2 and 15.1.1 showed significant trade–offs vary through time (P  < 0.05), while relationships between SDG 6.4.2 and 13.2, SDG 9.4.1 and 15.2.1 showed a significant synergistic relationship (P  < 0.05) (Fig. 3 f and Supplementary Table 7 ). In particular, we should focus on the relationship between SDG 15.1.1 and 15.2.1 shifted from a synergistic to a significant trade–off. The spatial distribution of trade–related SDG target bundles was B 1     (SDG 6.4.1, SDG13.2), B 2     (SDG 6.4.2, SDG15.2.1), B 3     (SDG9.4.1), B 4     (SDG 15.1.1) (Fig. 3 c and Supplementary Table 10 ). It was found that 37% of the provinces were dominated over the others (i.e., trade–offs) and 63% of the provinces where at least two of the SDG indicators (i.e., synergy) were dominated. To summarize, the strength of the synergistic relationship among trade–related SDG indicators in the adjacent provinces (i.e., Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Chongqing, and Sichuan) of Hubei province increased, that is, Hubei province mainly benefits from the trade of its adjacent provinces, which have a more negative impact from trade in Hubei province than the impact of adjacent trade itself.   4 Discussion 4.1 Main findings This study applied the historical dynamics and scenario–based method to present a quantitative assessment of the impacts of Chinese inter–provincial trade on spatio–temporal progress towards achieving the trade–related SDG targets. Our analyses further showed that Chinese inter–provincial trade improved the trade–related SDG targets scores of 16 out of 30 provinces, while the scores of the remaining 14 provinces decreased accordingly, this suggests that Chinese inter–provincial trade can either increase or decrease SDGs scores. Because of the differences in economic development level, resources endow, industrial structure, and energy composition, the ways and the methods to achieve the SDG targets level will be variant. In particular, developed provinces have benefited from Chinese inter–provincial trade in most of the SDGs, while developing provinces have suffered from Chinese inter–provincial trade in their progress towards achieving the SDG targets. One reason could be that Chinese inter–provincial trade is often accompanied by a negative impact on the environment. For example, developing provinces produce a large number of traded products while emitting a large amount of carbon dioxide, they are net exporters of embodied CO2  emissions, the developed provinces reduce their carbon emissions by importing products from the developing provinces, and become the net export provinces of embodied CO2  in trade. Thus, Chinese inter–provincial trade brings environmental benefits (e.g., an increase in trade–related SDG target scores) to developed provinces and environmental burdens to developing provinces. Our results show that distant trade has a more positive impact on trade–related SDG target scores in developed provinces than adjacent trade. This is mainly due to the remarkable spatial heterogeneity in resources endowed and economic development conditions, taking Xinjiang in western China as an example, which promotes trade–related SDG target scores with trade and inhibits trade–related SDG target scores with no–trade. Xinjiang mainly exports large quantities of agricultural products to other provinces, leading to a large number of virtual water out–flows (VWF). Developed provinces such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong possess high living standards, and much of the demand for agricultural products and other products with high water consumption process depends on imports from other provinces, especially those are far away, such as Xinjiang, which results in a massive VWF. Moreover, because of similar socio–economic conditions and natural resource reserves in adjacent provinces, it is clear that adjacent trade is less important for resource redistribution than distance trade. The empirical evidence suggests that the relationships between trade–related SDG indicators are dynamic through time and space. Our analysis indicates that the trajectory over time in China is not uniform across 30 provinces, but it is related to the spatial distribution of geographical environment and social economy factors (Zheng et al., 2020 ). The evidence also displays that the relationships between trade–related SDG indicators can change through time. From 2002 to 2017, it was found that the relationship between SDG 6.4.1 and 9.4.1 changed from trade–offs to significant trade–offs over time. Our results also show that most provinces specialized in a small set of SDG indicators, resulting in several unique SDG target bundles varying over time. Each trade–related SDG target bundles tended to specialized in one or a few SDG indicators.  4.2 Policy implications The present findings suggest that the spatial structures of the different types of trade–related SDG target bundles are increasingly found in rich resource provinces. This spatial clustering has led to trade–offs at the provincial level between SDG 6.4.1–9.4.1, SDG 6.4.2–15.1.1, SDG 9.4.1–15.1.1, SDG 13.2–15.1.1, SDG 15.1–15.2.1. For example, SDG 6.4.1–9.4.1 presented from trade–offs in 2002 to significant trade–offs in 2017. These changes may be partly due to the fact that the net transfer of embodied CO2  emissions to the provinces is mostly in western China or in developing provinces, and that the provinces are more energy–intensive or have a higher proportion of heavy chemical industries, undertaking part of the carbon emissions in the Chinese inter–provincial trade for the provinces. The provinces from which the embodied CO2  emissions are transferred are mostly those with relatively developed economy and low–carbon industries with high value–added industrial structure, transferring some of its emissions to the provinces through embodied CO2  emissions, but this may lead to more drastic trade–offs with other SDG indicators, such as water use efficiency, water stress level and CO2  emission intensity of forest management area. To sum up, two possible processes for forming such a trade–off: (1) the ways in which provinces achieve the SDGs tend to become more specialized through time; and (2) provincial governments dominate this trend, leading to the selection of the easiest and most appropriate SDG indicators to achieve according to the context of socio–economic and natural resource levels of provinces. Based on our results and discussion, some policy recommendations are provided as follows: First, a virtual resource compensation scheme can be designed to distribute the ecological burdens equally among provinces based on shares of economic gains in inter–provincial trade, which can help improve the problem of virtual resource inequality and promote coordinated regional development. Second, developing provinces should actively seek industrial upgrading at a certain stage of development and take the path of environment-friendly and high-quality development (Xin et al., 2022 ). Third, sustainable transformation that minimizes trade-offs and facilitates new synergies is necessary, especially for the provinces that are currently at the middle sustainable development level, near the turning point of SDG interactions (Wu et al., 2022 ).  4.3 Limitations and perspectives for future research There are several limitations of our study which can be improved in the future. First, six trade–related SDG indicators (i.e., SDG 6.4.1, SDG 6.4.2, SDG 9.4.1, SDG 13.2, SDG 15.1.1 and SDG 15.2.1) and many scenarios (e.g., trade and no–trade, distant trade and adjacent trade, developed and developing provinces) were used to estimate the impacts of China's inter–provincial trade on trade–related SDGs differed between the trade and no–trade scenarios, a distant trade scenario and an adjacent trade scenario, and developed and developing provinces, and identify changes in interactions among multiple SDG indicators over time and across space. Some uncertainties may exist regarding data collection (e.g., MRIO tables are only available in the year 2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017, respectively) or SDG indicator selection. To be conservative and simple, we assumed that all six trade–related SDG target scores would remain relatively unchanged from 2017 to 2020 due to the impact of the COVID–19 Pandemic occurred in Hubei Province on China's inter–provincial trade continues yet. The above process may cause some uncertainty. Second, we assessed the impact of China's inter–provincial trade on six trade–related SDGs that are likely to be affected by trade and for which there are clearly measurable indicators for assessing the impacts of trade. Future studies should include more SDG indicators (covering social, economic, political, and other aspects) and explore the impact of inter–provincial trade on the relationships (i.e., trade–offs and synergies) between multiple SDG indicators (Xu et al., 2020b ). This knowledge will help to maximize the positive impact of inter–provincial trade on SDG target scores and minimize its negative impact in order to promote China's sustainable development in a more comprehensive manner. Despite the limitations and uncertainties, this research can identify the opportunities for sustainable development for provinces at different levels, find specific action priorities for provinces at different levels based on a better understanding of the sustainable development process, and provide new insights into achieving as many SDGs as possible by 2030 (Wu et al., 2022 ).   5 Conclusion Our analyses indicate that Chinese inter–provincial trade improved the trade–related SDG target scores of 16 of 30 provinces but reduced the trade–related SDG target score of 14 of 30 provinces. Every province specialized in improving a bundle in is dominated by just a few SDG indicators. Our analysis also shows that the spatial structures of the different types of trade–related SDG target bundles are increasingly found in rich resource provinces. This spatial clustering has led to trade–offs at the provincial level between SDG 6.4.1–9.4.1, SDG 6.4.2–15.1.1, SDG 9.4.1–15.1.1, SDG 13.2–15.1.1, SDG 15.1–15.2.1. For example, SDG 6.4.1–9.4.1 presented from trade–offs in 2002 to significant trade–offs in 2017. Chinese inter–provincial trade and distant trade were more beneficial for achieving trade–related SDG targets in developed provinces. By contrast, Chinese inter–provincial trade suppressed the trade–related SDG target score of developing provinces. Our study suggests the need to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of progress towards SDGs at the provincial level and help identify the drivers behind these changing relationships in other nations.
