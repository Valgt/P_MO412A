                  Traditionally, the main focus of evaluation in universal electricity access problems has been cost. However, additional criteria such as increasing renewable penetration due to environmental concerns or grid penetration due to reliability concerns, have become increasingly important. We acknowledge the importance of additional criteria and propose a bi-objective framework so as to help decision makers investigate the trade-offs between potentially conflicting criteria in rural electrification. We consider two objective space based exact approaches using the Prize Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) formulation and two metaheuristic algorithms to find Pareto solutions, and investigate their performances on real life problem instances. This study is expected to be an important decision support tool for the electrification of underdeveloped communities, having the potential of contributing to their socio-economic development.

Many studies develop quantitative methods to assess the electrification alternatives, and recommend the cost minimizing option, considering the geographic heterogeneity of the demand points. In Refs. [7], a spatial planning approach that decides between grid and off-grid solutions to minimize the cost of electrification in Kenya is introduced. Based on this paper, an online decision support mechanism named Network Planner (NP) has been developed to explore electrification options for rural communities [8] and used in national electrification studies [9]. REM is another computer-based optimization model for electrification planning that identifies the lowest cost system designs evaluating grid and off-grid systems for demand points at different scales [10]. A demand estimation approach along with a cost-optimization model to choose among grid extension and stand-alone solar options is proposed in Ref. [11]. With a spatial network model and realistic cost estimates [12], showed that off-grid systems are competitive options for remote areas, while grid connected systems dominate in dense areas. Distances between villages and patterns of household spacing are crucial for estimating grid line costs [13]. In Ref. [14], the authors estimated a distance limit that equalizes the costs of off-grid option and the grid extension to a village. The authors in Ref. [15] examined grid and off-grid options for 150 countries and concluded that the least cost solution depends on electricity consumption, population distribution, transmission cost and the cost difference between the two options. Using real life instances, the authors in Ref. [16] showed that cost minimizing solutions typically involve a hybrid system that pairs grid with off-grid options. It is also discussed in Ref. [17] that grid option is complemented with off-grid systems in the lowest cost electrification plans for sub-Saharan Africa.  0  item S0360-5442(20)32412-9 S0360544220324129 1-s2.0-S0360544220324129

Traditionally, the main focus of evaluation in universal electricity access problems has been cost. However, additional criteria such as increasing renewable penetration due to environmental concerns or grid penetration due to reliability concerns, have become increasingly important. We acknowledge the importance of additional criteria and propose a bi-objective framework so as to help decision makers investigate the trade-offs between potentially conflicting criteria in rural electrification. We consider two objective space based exact approaches using the Prize Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) formulation and two metaheuristic algorithms to find Pareto solutions, and investigate their performances on real life problem instances. This study is expected to be an important decision support tool for the electrification of underdeveloped communities, having the potential of contributing to their socio-economic development.   Keywords Rural electrification  Bi-objective prize collecting Steiner tree problem  Grid  Off-grid  ε-constraint  Perpendicular search  NSGAII  SPEA2    1 Introduction Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030 and has well-defined targets such as establishing universal access to modern energy services, increasing the global percentage of renewable energy and doubling the improvement in energy efficiency [1 ]. Although International Energy Agency estimated that the number of people without electricity access has been reduced to 860 million and the share of renewable sources has risen to almost 11% of the total final energy consumption in 2018, it is argued that the progress should speed up to reach the targets by 2030. Access to modern energy is vital for development, especially in the rural areas. Better living conditions in terms of health and education cannot be achieved without investments in electricity in developing countries [2 ]. In addition to the improvement in the living conditions, electricity access provides socio-economic, socio-political, and environmental benefits [3 ]. In this direction, spatial electricity planning projects are necessitated to evaluate the electrification options such as centralized grid and decentralized off-grid systems [4 ]. Today’s centralized systems mostly run with fossil fuels generated at large amounts and require significant network infrastructure [5 ]. However, they are still regarded as a reliable and long-term option to obtain continuous power supply. Energy leapfrogging, on the other hand, is also a very popular concept for rural electrification and implies skipping fossil fuel based centralized systems and jumping directly into off-grid systems that operate with clean, renewable energy sources [6 ]. Traditionally, the main criterion used for the evaluation of electrification options in spatial electricity planning has been cost. Many studies develop quantitative methods to assess the electrification alternatives, and recommend the cost minimizing option, considering the geographic heterogeneity of the demand points. In Refs. [7 ], a spatial planning approach that decides between grid and off-grid solutions to minimize the cost of electrification in Kenya is introduced. Based on this paper, an online decision support mechanism named Network Planner (NP ) has been developed to explore electrification options for rural communities [8 ] and used in national electrification studies [9 ]. REM is another computer-based optimization model for electrification planning that identifies the lowest cost system designs evaluating grid and off-grid systems for demand points at different scales [10 ]. A demand estimation approach along with a cost-optimization model to choose among grid extension and stand-alone solar options is proposed in Ref. [11 ]. With a spatial network model and realistic cost estimates [12 ], showed that off-grid systems are competitive options for remote areas, while grid connected systems dominate in dense areas. Distances between villages and patterns of household spacing are crucial for estimating grid line costs [13 ]. In Ref. [14 ], the authors estimated a distance limit that equalizes the costs of off-grid option and the grid extension to a village. The authors in Ref. [15 ] examined grid and off-grid options for 150 countries and concluded that the least cost solution depends on electricity consumption, population distribution, transmission cost and the cost difference between the two options. Using real life instances, the authors in Ref. [16 ] showed that cost minimizing solutions typically involve a hybrid system that pairs grid with off-grid options. It is also discussed in Ref. [17 ] that grid option is complemented with off-grid systems in the lowest cost electrification plans for sub-Saharan Africa. While the focus of aforementioned studies is mostly on the cost of rural electrification, SDG7 has additional concerns such as increasing renewable penetration while ensuring universal electricity access. In line with this, we suggest a bi-objective optimization framework that will help the decision makers investigate alternative solutions that are better than the cost minimizing solution with respect to renewable penetration, i.e. CO2  emissions. Of course, these alternative designs should be Pareto solutions in the sense that no other design can improve them with respect both cost and emission. Note that another objective in rural electrification would be maximizing the number of people connected to the grid, as discussed in Ref. [18 ]. Even though this may not be an environmentally-friendly option, people might prefer to be connected to the main grid for reliability purposes. This preference is observed in the interviews conducted in Ghana, in which the interviewees stated that “We will wait for the national grid no matter how long it takes” [19 ]. Our framework can also be used to help decision makers that have reliability concerns in addition to cost concerns. In this case, one would like to see how deviating from the (hybrid) minimum cost solution so as to increase grid connection would affect the network design. By our assumption, the grid is based on fossil fuels, thus increasing grid connectivity is equivalent to decreasing renewable penetration. Hence the trade-off is always between cost and either one of the reliability or emission criteria, leading to a bi-objective framework. Such multi(bi)-criteria decision making tools have been highly utilized in the literature for energy planning, but mostly with a focus on design and planning of decentralized energy systems. (See a comprehensive review paper in Ref. [20 ]). However, the number of studies that evaluate the rural electrification options and determine the grid and off-grid compatible demand points with a multi-objective perspective is quite limited [21 ]. To the best of our knowledge there is only one study by Ref. [18 ], where grid and off-grid technologies are assessed in terms of cost and political preferences with a lexicographic approach. It is discussed that the interest of local people may be in favor of the national grid system, while an off-grid electrification option is a suitable choice in terms of cost. The result indicates that different preferences cause significant regional differences in terms of electrification system choice. In the bi-objective framework proposed in this study, rather than a lexicographic approach that would require a priority ordering between the criteria, a-posteriori approach is used and all Pareto solutions are generated for the decision maker (DM) to observe and choose from. To do so, the performance of two exact solution approaches that are reported to perform well for solving bi-objective integer programming problems, ε-constraint and Perpendicular Search, are investigated. These approaches are chosen as they are objective space based solution algorithms and therefore, are expected to be computationally more efficient than decision space based solution algorithms such as branch-and-bound. Both approaches are based on solving single objective scalarization problems repetitively, each time with different parameters, so as to find different Pareto solutions of the problem. Among the alternative objective space based algorithms, the ε-constraint and Perpendicular Search are chosen as they are based on the two mostly implemented scalarization models, the ε-constraint scalarization and the weighted sum scalarization, respectively. These two are stated as the most popular scalarizations (See chapter 4 in Ref. [22 ]), which is due to their reported success in various applications in the literature. These exact algorithms are based on a Bi-objective Prize Collecting Steiner Tree (BOPCST) formulation of the rural electrification problem. Since PCST is an NP-hard problem [23 ], even the single objective version of the problem is computationally challenging. Therefore, this study also considers two evolutionary algorithms, NSGAII and SPEA2, which have been widely preferred for finding approximate Pareto solutions to multi-objective programming problems in reasonable time. These two algorithms are emphasized among others in Ref. [24 ] to be considered for multi-objective optimization as they incorporate known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm theory, respecting relevant theoretical issues. Their success has been demonstrated empirically in many multi-objective optimization problems and their real-world applications (See Section 2.6 in Ref. [24 ]). The contribution of this work is as follows: i)  In a recent review paper on rural electrification [21 ], the authors highlight the need for multi-objective analysis of alternative electrification options by explicitly stating the following: ” … there are no tools that perform multi-objective optimization (for instance, considering cost, emissions, or non served energy) allowing them to analyze their trade-offs.” To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one that proposes a bi-objective optimization framework. ii)  As opposed to using a lexicographic approach that prioritizes criteria, the bi-objective optimization problem is solved so as to find the whole set of Pareto solutions, which allows the decisions makers observe the trade-offs between cost and CO2  emission (or level of grid-connection). iii)  We do not only consider exact solution approaches, which may be computationally demanding; but also customize well-known metaheuristic approaches for this rural electrification problem. This study is expected to be an important decision support tool for the electrification of underdeveloped communities, having the potential of contributing to their socio-economic development. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 , the problem definition and formulation are provided. In Section 3 , the proposed solution approaches are described and the results of the computational experiments are provided in Section 4 . In Section 5 , a detailed analysis of the Pareto solutions is made. Furthermore, implications of using grid connection as the second criterion in a cost minimization setting are discussed. Finally, Section 6  concludes the paper.  2 Problem definition and formulation The single-objective version of the PCST problem is proposed in Ref. [16 ] for the least-cost evaluation of electrification systems. The problem is defined as the Goemans and Williamson (GW) cost minimization version of the PCST problem [25 ]. It is assumed that all demand points have non-negative penalties proportional to the cost of off-grid system, which will be paid unless the points are included in the tree (i.e. connected to the grid). The aim is to determine the demand points to be served by off-grid systems and to design a radial network between the grid-compatible points in a way that the total cost of electrification is minimized. The cost components of the grid are categorized as internal and external costs. The medium or high voltage lines between the primary electricity source and the demand points form the external costs and the internal costs include both low voltage lines and transformer costs within the points. Off-grid system costs consist of the infrastructure cost of photo-voltaic systems and storage costs. The system components considered are illustrated in Fig. 1  . In a grid-connected system, the communities are served in a centralized way where the electricity is assumed to be generated from fossil fuels. The off-grid option, on the other hand, consists of stand-alone decentralized systems that generate electricity from solar. Off-grid systems are in favor of reducing the greenhouse emissions (such as CO2 ); however, they may not be cost efficient, especially for the points with high demand. Grid option, on the other hand, may not be the best choice for remote communities. Therefore, a cost-efficient solution is expected to yield a hybrid system that combines grid and off-grid systems. In this study, our goal is to generate alternative designs for an electrification system considering both cost and renewable penetration (CO2  emission) concerns. While constructing the second objective, it is assumed that the renewable sources have zero CO2  emission value while grid-connected nodes cause CO2  emission proportional to their electricity demand. Due to the structure of this problem, minimizing CO2  emission promotes the usage of the off-grid system but, minimizing the overall cost of the system may necessitate the grid option for some demand points. Presenting and analyzing the trade-off between these two objectives is the primary motivation of this study. The problem is formulated as a BOPCST problem, which is based on a single commodity flow formulation [26 ]. Parameters and decision variables of the model are shown in Table 1  .(1) z 1  : min  ∑  i ∈ N   C O G i    s i  + ∑  i ∈ N   C I i   x i  + ∑  j ∈ N   ∑  i ∈ N   C E i j    u i j       (2) z 2  : min  ∑  i ∈ N   D i  x i      (3) s . t .  x i  + s i  = 1  ∀ i     (4) ∑  i ∈ N   v i  ≤ 1     (5) n v i  ≥ φ i   ∀ i     (6) ∑  j ∈ N   f i j   + x i  = ∑  l ∈ N   f l i   + φ i   ∀ i     (7) n u l i   ≥ f l i    ∀ i , l     (8) ∑  l ∈ N   u l i   + v i  = x i   ∀ i     (9) u i j   ≤ x i   ∀ i , j     (10) x i  ∈ { 0,1 }   ∀ i     (11) s i  ∈ { 0,1 }   ∀ i     (13) v i  ∈ { 0,1 }   ∀ i     (14) u i j   ∈ { 0,1 }   ∀ i     (15) f i j   ≥ 0  ∀ i , j     (16) φ i  ≥ 0  ∀ i      The first objective function (1) minimizes the total cost of the system, which includes the costs of off-grid systems as well as internal and external grid costs of the grid-compatible nodes. The second objective function (2) minimizes the total demand met by the grid option, which is, by assumption, equivalent to the minimization of CO2  emission or the maximization of the demand met by renewable based off-grid systems. In constraint 3, it is guaranteed that each node is either connected to the grid or electrified with an off-grid system. Constraint 4 states that there can be only one root node on the grid and constraint 5 sets the flow amount on the root node. Constraint 6 provides the flow balance equation for the nodes that will be connected with the grid. It ensures that if a node is connected to the grid, the total flow coming from other grid connected nodes is equal to the sum of the flow leaving this node and consumed in this node. Constraint 7 indicates that there is no flow between two nodes if they are not directly connected on the grid. Constraint 8 assures that the root node cannot have a predecessor. Constraint 9 provides that if a node is not on the grid, it is not connected to any other node. Constraints 10–16 are the domain constraints.  3 Solution approaches The bi-objective problem considered in this study aims to inform the decision makers on the trade-off between the potentially conflicting objectives of minimizing cost and minimizing CO2  emission in rural electrification. For that purpose, the nondominated (Pareto) solutions of the problem are found. For two objective function vectors z 1     and z 2    , z 1     dominates z 2     if z i 1  ≤ z i 2   ∀ i    and z i 1  < z i 2   for at least one  i   . An objective function vector is nondominated (i.e., the solution is a Pareto solution) if it is not dominated by the objective function vector of any other feasible solution. The BOPCST formulation is a bi-objective integer programming problem [27 ]. Various solution methodologies are introduced in the literature for bi-objective integer programming problems (See e.g. Ref. [28 ,29 ]). The solution approaches are mainly divided into two categories: exact solution approaches, which guarantee returning Pareto solutions; and heuristic (or metaheuristic) approaches, which are usually faster, but without quality guarantee. The exact solution approaches are further categorized based on the space they work as objective (criterion) space based and decision space based algorithms. In this study, objective space based approaches are utilized as they are considered more likely to be successful (See Ref. [28 ] for a detailed discussion on the advantages of criterion space based algorithms over decision space based ones.). In this study, two commonly-used exact solution approaches that are reported to perform well on bi-objective integer programming problems are used. These are the ε-constraint method and the perpendicular search method [28 ]. Although these algorithms are efficient as exact approaches, they may require significant computation time for solving real-life problems of large size. This is because they are based on solving single objective scalarization models related to the original problem and their computational time is directly affected by how hard the corresponding single objective optimization problem is. Considering the fact that even a single objective version of the PCST problem is NP-hard, any such exact approach is expected to run into computational difficulty when solving larger-sized instances of the bi-objective extension of the problem. Two metaheuristic approaches are customized to provide an approximate Pareto solution set. The approaches are multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which are vastly used in computationally challenging problems, where achieving the exact Pareto is difficult. See, for example [30–32 ], and [33 ] for other applications of metaheuristic algorithms on rural electrification, grid connected decentralized system design, hybrid system design and optimal power flow problems, respectively. The aim of these approaches is to provide a sufficiently good approximation of the Pareto frontier. Note that, since metaheuristic approaches do not guarantee finding true Pareto solutions, the solution sets obtained by two different metaheuristic approaches would be different; as opposed to the case with exact algorithms, which always return the true Pareto. Moreover, as the No Free-Lunch theorems indicate, no metaheuristic solution algorithm is guaranteed to be the best over all problems ([24 ,34 ]). The performances of all algorithms are investigated and discussed in detail in the following sections. 3.1 ε-Constraint method The main idea of this algorithm is to solve a single objective optimization problem repetitively, which focuses on one of the objective functions at a time, with an additional constraint that restricts the value of the other objective function. For simplification and with a slight abuse of notation, the problem will be denoted as follows, where x  is the decision variable vector (this constitutes all decision variables discussed in BOPCST formulation), X   is the feasible set and z 1  ( x )     and z 2  ( x )     are the cost and CO2  minimization objectives, respectively:min  z 1  ( x )     min  z 2  ( x )     s . t .  x ∈ X         The ε-constraint method is given in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1:  ε-Constraint Method  N = ∅ , f e a s i b l e = 1 , s t e p = 1     Solve: min  z 1  ( x )  : x ∈ X   . Let x ∗     be an optimal solution.  N = ( z 1  ( x ∗  )  , z 2  ( x ∗  )   )    .  Set ε = z 2  ( x ∗  )  − s t e p     while f e a s i b l e = 1   do   Solve P : min  z 1  ( x )  | x ∈ X , z 2  ( x )  ≤ ε   .  if P  is feasible then   Let x ∗     be an optimal solution. N = N ∪ ( z 1  ( x ∗  )  , z 2  ( x ∗  )   )    .  Set ε = z 2  ( x ∗  )  − s t e p     else   f e a s i b l e = 0     end if   end while   Return nondominated points in N  .       The algorithm starts by finding the Pareto solution that has the minimum cost value by only minimizing the cost function (z 1  ( x )    ). This solution has the largest CO2  emission value across all Pareto solutions. At each iteration of the algorithm, a new model is solved, which ensures that a new solution with a better CO2  emission value is found (this is achieved by introducing the constraint that restricts the CO2  objective in problem P : z 2  ( x )  ≤ ε   ). The algorithm stops when it is not possible to find such a new solution. Note that the algorithm uses a parameter s t e p   , which determines the stepsize for restricting the CO2  objective. If the objective function whose value is controlled by the constraint is guaranteed to have integer values only, then setting s t e p    = 1 ensures that the whole set of Pareto solutions will be found. If it is not the case, s t e p    controls the maximum deviation that a ”missed” (not generated) Pareto solution can have from a solution returned in terms of the second objective function value. As s t e p    gets larger, the algorithm is expected to return less solutions, which are scattered on the Pareto frontier.  3.2 Perpendicular search This method is based on the idea of searching objective space by partitioning it into sub-regions (see Ref. [27 ,35 ,36 ] for different variants of the method). It is based on iteratively exploring predefined boxes (intervals) in the objective function space to search for new Pareto solutions. Each interval is defined by two Pareto points ( z a  , z b   )  : z 1 a  < z 1 b    . In order to check whether there is any other Pareto solution in the interval the following model is solved:P ( z a  , z b   )  : min  λ 1  z 1  ( x )  + λ 2  z 2  ( x )     s . t .  x ∈ X    z 1  ( x )  ≤ z 1 b  − Δ 1     z 2  ( x )  ≤ z 2 a  − Δ 2         where λ 1  = z 2 a  − z 2 b     and λ 2  = z 1 b  − z 1 a    . This model optimizes a weighted aggregation of the two objective functions subject to the constraints of the original problem and two additional constraints ensuring that the solution is in the interval between z a     and z b    . See Fig. 2   for visualization of an interval. In this example, P ( z a  , z b   )     will return the solution that has objective function vector z ∗    . Algorithm 2:  Perpendicular Search  Solve: l e x m i n ( z 1  ( x )  , z 2  ( x )   )  : x ∈ X   . Let x ∗     be an optimal solution. z a  = z ( x ∗  )    . N = { z a  }    .  Solve l e x m i n ( z 2  ( x )  , z 1  ( x )   )  : x ∈ X   . Let x ∗     be an optimal solution.z b  = z ( x ∗  )    . N = N ∪ { z b  }    .  I ← { ( z a  , z b   )  }      while I ≠ ∅   do   Select an interval ( z a  , z b   )  ∈ I   . I = I ∖ { ( z a  , z b   )  }    .  Solve P ( z a  , z b   )    .  if P ( z a  , z b   )     is feasible then   Let x ∗     be an optimal solution of P ( z a  , z b   )    . Let z ∗  = z ( x ∗  )    .  N = N ∪ { z ∗  }    .  if z 2 a  − z 2 ∗  ≥ Δ   then   I ← I ∪ { ( z a  , z ∗   )  }      end if   if z 2 ∗  − z 2 b  ≥ Δ   then   I ← I ∪ { ( z ∗  , z b   )  }      end if   end if   end while        The Perpendicular Search (PS) algorithm is summarized below. The search is initialized by the largest box that contains the whole set of Pareto solutions, defined by the points that have the minimum cost ( z 1  ( x )   )     and the minimum CO2 ( z 2  ( x )   ) values, respectively. Set I  keeps the intervals yet-to-be searched. At an arbitrary iteration, an interval to be searched ( z a  , z b   )     is explored by solving the corresponding P ( z a  , z b   )    . If a new solution is found, two new intervals are generated. Note that if an interval is too small (that is, if the difference of its corners with respect to the CO2  objective is below a threshold Δ  , the new interval is not generated). The role of Δ   is similar to the role of s t e p    parameter used in the ε-constraint algorithm. The algorithm terminates when there are no intervals left to explore. In the example shown in Fig. 2 , solving P ( z a  , z b   )     will return the solution that has objective function vector z ∗    . Then two new intervals will be added to I . In the upcoming iterations the other points will be found by solving P ( z a  , z ∗   )     and P ( z ∗  , z b   )    , respectively.  3.3 Metaheuristic algorithms Solving a bi-objective problem using exact solution approaches is desirable as there is no question on the quality of the solutions obtained. However, even the single objective cost minimizing variant of PCST problem is notoriously hard, implying that exact approaches may fail to provide solutions in reasonable time. Therefore, this study also includes metaheuristic approaches, which have been widely preferred for finding approximate Pareto solutions to multi-objective programming problems, thanks to their computation time advantage. The performances of two well-known genetic algorithms, NSGAII and SPEA2 are explored on BOPCST. Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) is proposed by Deb et al. [37 ] and is a widely used Genetic Algorithm due to its high performance in terms of solution time and quality. NSGAII starts with producing an initial population of size N . Each member of the population corresponds to a partitioning of the set of nodes into two sets: grid-connected and off-grid. For each such partition, Prim’s algorithm [38 ] is used to determine the minimum spanning tree (MST) for the nodes to be connected to the grid. Members of the population are sorted according to the non-dominance levels (measured by the number of solutions that dominate a specific solution) and a child population is created. Then the main loop begins. In an arbitrary iteration of the main loop, the offspring and parent populations are merged and N  members are selected from this pool as parents. Then a child population is created. These steps are repeated until a certain number of generations are produced by the algorithm. The pseudocode of the algorithm is provided in Algorithm 3. SPEA2 (Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm) is another popular multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that is used for finding or approximating the Pareto set for multi-objective optimization problems [39 ]. The SPEA2 algorithm keeps two sets of solutions, namely population and archive. The archive is used to keep the nondominated solutions obtained so far. The overall algorithm works as follows: Initially, a population of solutions is generated and the archive is the empty set. At each iteration of the algorithm, fitness values are assigned to the members of these two sets (the solutions in the archive always get a better fitness value). The archive is updated by copying all nondominated members in the union of these two sets. Archive is of a fixed size, hence is truncated if the number of nondominated solutions exceeds this size or filled with dominated individuals otherwise. If the stopping condition is satisfied, the algorithm stops and returns the nondominated solutions in the archive. Otherwise, a mating pool is selected from the solutions in the archive by applying binary tournament selection with replacement. Recombination and mutation operators are applied to this mating pool and the resulting population is the population of the next iteration, i.e., the loop is repeated (starting with the calculation of the fitness values). The interested reader is referred to Ref. [39 ] for a more detailed description and discussion of the algorithm. The pseudocode of the algorithm is provided in Algorithm 4.

The performances of the solution approaches are compared with respect to solution time and solution quality. The solution times are measured in CPU (central processing unit) seconds. For measuring the quality of solutions returned by the metaheuristic algorithms, the following metrics are used:• Spacing (S): The following metric proposed by Schott [40 ] shows the diversity of the solutions in a given set. For a given set of n  (approximate) Pareto vectors, the metric finds the minimum Manhattan distance between vector i  and any other vector, which is denoted as d i    . d ¯     is the mean value of all d i    s. The metric (S) is the standard deviation of these n  Manhattan distances.   S = 1 n − 1   ∑  i = 1   n  ( d i  − d ¯   )  2        d i  = min j  | z 1 i  − z 1 j  |  + | z 2 i  − z 2 j  |   i , j = 1 , … , n     Smaller S values indicate more uniformly distributed points, which is desirable.• Maximum Spread (MS): This measure shows the maximum extension covered by the solution set [41 ]. For a given set N  , it is evaluated using the following equation:   M S = ∑  m = 1   2  ( max z ∈ N   z m  − min z ∈ N   z m   )  2         MS is the distance between the two outer solutions of the given (approximate) Pareto set. A higher value for MS is desirable since it shows that the solution set is spread and covers a wider range.• Set coverage (SC): This metric is proposed by Ref. [42 ] and is used to make a relative coverage comparison between two sets of (approximate) Pareto vectors [24 ]. Let N 1     and N 2     be two sets of solution vectors. SC(N 1  , N 2    ) is the ratio of points in N 2     that are dominated (for two vectors a  and b , b  dominates a  when b ≤ a   ) by at least one point in N 1     [43 ]).   S C ( N 1  , N 2   )  = | { a ∈ N 2   |  ∃  b ∈ N 1  : b ≤ a  }  |  | N 2  |       S C ( N 1  , N 2   )     can take the value in [0,1] interval. Both S C ( N 1  , N 2   )     and S C ( N 2  , N 1   )     values are calculated since there can be intersections between sets. The experiments are performed using real-life instances with 21, 102 and 141 nodes obtained from Ref. [44 ]. The selected instances represent rural settlements in sub-Saharan Africa with different number of demand points. The data includes the distances between the demand points, internal & off-grid costs, demand for each node and the unit cost of external grid cost. Exact solution algorithms are coded using Java and all mathematical models are solved using CPLEX 12.7. Genetic algorithms are implemented in Java using an open source library for evolutionary algorithms [45 ]. All experiments are performed in a computer with Intel Xeon CPU E5-1650 3.6 GHz processor and 64 GB RAM. In the ε-constraint (EC) approach, the stepsize parameter affects the number of solutions found. The stepsize on the second objective (z 2    ) is set as 1. Since this objective can only take integer values, this ensures that the whole set of Pareto solutions is found. Similarly, in the perpendicular search (PS) approach, Δ 1     , Δ 2     and Δ   are set as 1. For SPEA2 and NSGAII algorithms, the number of evaluations (generations) and the population size are the parameters that affect the solution time and hence the quality of the returned solutions. The population size is set as 500 and two levels for the number of evaluations are used: 100000, and 1000000. These variants are called 1 and 2, respectively. For both algorithms variant 1 is expected to be faster, but with lower quality solutions. Results of the computational experiments on the first data set with 21 nodes are provided in Tables 2–3   . Table 2  reports the number of points returned (ND) and the solution times for each algorithm variant. For the exact approaches, the number of models solved is also reported. When exact approaches EC and PS are compared, it is observed that EC is better than the PS in terms of the number of models solved, hence the solution time. This is mainly due to the fact that in the EC approach, whenever a mathematical model is solved either a new point is found or the algorithm terminates. However, the PS approach terminates after verifying that the intervals between all consecutive Pareto points are empty, leading to more mathematical models to be solved for this verification. When metaheuristic approaches are compared, it is seen that SPEA2 performs poorly in terms of solution time. Indeed, it even has significantly higher solution time than the exact algorithms EC and PS. Note that the number of solutions returned may not be an indicator of solution quality for the metaheuristic approaches. To observe the quality of the solution set returned by these approaches the spacing (S) and the maximum spread (MS) values are calculated and summarized in Table 2 . It is seen that, although the first variants of the metaheuristic algorithms are faster, they return worse quality solution sets than their counterparts. When the variant is fixed, both metaheuristic algorithms return similar quality solution sets with respect to S and MS. This is also verified with the set coverage values reported in Table 3 . Solution sets returned by NSGAII-1 and SPEA2-1 are of comparable quality as are the sets returned by EC, PS, NSGAII-2 and SPEA2-2. Overall, whenever the solution time limit allows, it is better to use the exact algorithms. In case they fail to return solutions in reasonable time, NSGAII can be used since SPEA2’s high solution time is not justified by better quality solutions. Tables 4 and 5    summarize the results for the problem instance with 102 nodes. A time limit of 4 h is used for the exact approaches. Similar to the previous case, it is seen that SPEA2 requires more time compared to NSGAII. The EC approach requires reasonable time and outperforms all the other approaches with respect to quality as seen in Tables 4 and 5  PS fails to return the whole set of solutions within the time limit.  5 Discussion Given the Pareto solutions obtained in the previous sections, this section firstly discusses the trade-off between alternative Pareto solutions and presents an in-depth analysis on the grid topography. Moreover, the experimental results using the instances with 21 and 102 nodes so far investigated the case where two criteria are cost and CO2  emission. However, as discussed section 1 , in some settings the additional criterion may be increasing the number of people connected to the grid so as to increase reliability. In systems where the grid is mostly fossil fuel based, this criterion effects the system design in the opposite direction of CO2  criterion. In this section, a new data set is introduced to discuss this alternative criterion. 5.1 A detailed analysis on the Pareto solutions For demonstration purposes, the set of Pareto solutions of the problem instance with 21 nodes is shown in Fig. 3  . This figure clearly demonstrates the trade-off between the cost and emission criteria and allows the DM to analyze a spectrum of solutions between the two extremes of cost minimizing and emission minimizing solutions. We provide further details on four example solutions representing different sub-regions of the frontier. These solutions are chosen such that they are uniformly spread across the Pareto frontier and are shown with square marks in Fig. 3 . We provide information on these solutions in Table 6   and give the corresponding grid networks in Fig. 4  (a)-4(d), respectively. Table 6  shows the cost and emission levels as well as the percentage of demand served by the grid and the percentage of nodes connected to the grid. A number of observations can be made given these Figures. First of all, it is observed that the cost minimizing solution (1)  heavily relies on grid connection, hence it has a high emission level. Yet it is still a hybrid network since it leaves nodes in remote areas out and serves them with off-grid systems. The other extreme, emission minimizing solution (113) is trivially found and it serves all nodes with off-grid systems. In between, solutions 26 and 74 offer compromise designs, each with different levels of cost and emissions.  5.2 An alternative objective: maximizing grid connection If maximizing grid connection and minimizing cost are taken as decision criteria and if the minimum cost solution already ensures maximum grid connection (100%), then the problem is no longer a bi-objective decision making problem. If, however, the minimum cost solution has a small fraction of the population connected to grid, then the trade-off between the two criteria would be high, which should be observed by a bi-objective analysis. To illustrate this case, an instance with 141 nodes is utilized. The bi-objective model proposed in Section 2  is used, this time changing the second objective function (z 2    ) as min ∑  i ∈ N   D i  s i     so as to minimize the population served by off-grid systems. Note that the demand values in the data set are provided as a function of population and the instance with 141 nodes includes both terminal and non-terminal nodes, i.e. nodes without any penalty values also exist. Tables 7 and 8    and Fig. 5   summarize the results for the problem instance with 141 nodes. The exact approaches fail to find the whole set of Pareto solutions within the time limit of 4 h, PS performing significantly worse than EC. Metaheuristic algorithms have the computational time advantage; however, they might return inferior quality solutions compared to the exact solutions as seen in Fig. 5 . Fig. 5  shows the solutions returned by EC, PS, and the second variants of NSGAII and SPEA2 algorithms. EC starts from the minimum cost edge of the Pareto frontier and moves towards the solution with minimum population served by off-grid option (i.e. maximum grid connection). Since the algorithm is terminated within 4 h, only a subset of the Pareto solutions towards the minimum cost edge is found. This makes the set of solutions performing poorly with respect to the spacing metric as seen in Table 7 . On the other hand, Fig. 5  indicates that there is still value in investing in exact solution approaches as the solutions of the metaheuristic algorithms may deviate from the Pareto frontier. Towards the minimum cost edge, a significant portion of the metaheuristic solutions are dominated by solutions returned by EC, which is also seen in the set coverage results in Table 8 . To sum up, EC returns good quality solutions which are not spread; the metaheuristic algorithms return more spread solutions but without quality guarantee. One way to obtain good quality solutions spread across the Pareto frontier would be implementing the EC algorithm with larger stepsize (s t e p   ) values. In both bi-objective problem variants considered (min cost-min CO2  and min cost-max grid connection), the exact algorithms are obviously better in terms of solution quality if they can terminate in reasonable time. However, this was not possible for PS for most instances as it failed to terminate in 4 h for instances with 102 and 141 nodes. EC can provide the whole Pareto for instances with 102 nodes but it ran into computational difficulty for the largest instances. When this is the case, metaheuristic algorithms constitute viable and effective options, as they can provide good approximations of the Pareto frontier. Among these, in the problem instances considered in this work, NSGAII outperforms SPEA2 as it returns similar quality solutions in much less time. Note that these results are observed over all instances of the problem that are solved. However, the relative performances of the algorithms might change in other problem settings. As stated in Ref. [24 ], any algorithmic approach would have some shortcomings when applied to certain problem classes. In Ref. [34 ], No Free-Lunch theorems are discussed, which establish that for any algorithm, ”any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class”, hence no algorithm is guaranteed to be the best performer over all problems.   6 Conclusion Rural electrification projects are typically evaluated with respect to cost. However, there is a need for considering additional objectives for these projects in line with Sustainable Development Goals, such as minimizing CO2  emissions or with user preferences such as maximizing the number of people served by the centralized grid. To address this need, this study proposes a bi-objective framework for the universal energy access problem that will help decision makers analyze the trade-off between cost and these additional criteria. Two objective space based solution approaches are used, ε-constraint approach and the perpendicular search, utilizing BOPCST, a bi-objective prize collecting Steiner tree formulation of the problem. Even the single objective PCST is NP-hard, hence finding the Pareto solutions of the bi-objective PCST is computationally challenging. Therefore, the performance of two metaheuristic approaches, NSGAII and SPEA2, for BOPCST are also investigated. It is observed that the ε-constraint approach outperforms the perpendicular search in terms of solution time. It is also seen that SPEA2 performs poorly with high solution times yet low quality solutions. EC and NSGAII are the suggested options for finding exact and approximate Pareto solutions, respectively. For future research, this study can be extended in a number of aspects. In this study, only the grid and off-grid options are considered. The mini-grid option can be investigated as it has increasing popularity among the rural electrification systems. Moreover, this work only considers cost-emission and cost-grid penetration trade-offs. Incorporating other relevant criteria such as reliability into the problem and exploring algorithms for effectively solving the resulting multi-objective optimization problems is another direction for future research. Future research can also analyze the performance of alternative exact and heuristic methodologies for the same problem and focus on solving larger-sized instances in reasonable time.
