                  The paper focuses on environmental monitoring in European regions using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework. Adopted in 2015, the United Nations SDG are a set of global goals developed to guide countries towards sustainable development. Although designed for the national level, it is growingly argued that achieving the SDG requires action at the sub-national, local level. With this in mind, in this paper, we use indicators co-designed by researchers and SDG practitioners from European regional administrations to monitor the environmental status of selected European regions over a period of time. We consider environmental monitoring a domain that encompasses activities beyond the monitoring and reducing CO2 emissions alone and widely regards biodiversity and conservation, ecosystems, climate change, environmental pollution and human ecology. By default, this touches upon different sectors of society (from energy to mobility, and production to consumption), and the latter is also reflected in the SDG and their targets. To this end, we isolate indicators that directly and indirectly address the environment as a domain to highlight areas where there is a need for improvement. Finally, the paper provides insights into how the SDG framework can be used to monitor environmental progress at the regional level in Europe and how the current policy framework might also contribute to this progress.

The paper focuses on environmental monitoring in European regions using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework. Adopted in 2015, the United Nations SDG are a set of global goals developed to guide countries towards sustainable development. Although designed for the national level, it is growingly argued that achieving the SDG requires action at the sub-national, local level. With this in mind, in this paper, we use indicators co-designed by researchers and SDG practitioners from European regional administrations to monitor the environmental status of selected European regions over a period of time. We consider environmental monitoring a domain that encompasses activities beyond the monitoring and reducing CO2  emissions alone and widely regards biodiversity and conservation, ecosystems, climate change, environmental pollution and human ecology. By default, this touches upon different sectors of society (from energy to mobility, and production to consumption), and the latter is also reflected in the SDG and their targets. To this end, we isolate indicators that directly and indirectly address the environment as a domain to highlight areas where there is a need for improvement. Finally, the paper provides insights into how the SDG framework can be used to monitor environmental progress at the regional level in Europe and how the current policy framework might also contribute to this progress.

Despite humanity's direct dependence on the environment, human actions have been responsible for worldwide biodiversity loss and ecosystem deterioration (Díaz and Malhi, 2022 ). Anthropogenic actions were found to be directly accountable for altering at least 70% of the land surface, 66% of the ocean surface, and around 85% of wetlands (Díaz et al., 2019 ). During the past 50 years, these unprecedented changes were driven by (i) direct factors: changes in land and sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution; and invasion of alien species, and (ii) indirect factors: production and consumption patterns, human population dynamics and trends, trade, technological innovations (IPBES, 2019 ). Emerging environmental issues are a worldwide scientific, societal, and political concern. Given the fast-paced evident impacts, it is clear that quantifying and monitoring the state of the environment is essential for informed policymaking toward sustainability. Given the interdependency of ecosystems, addressing environmental concerns and their transboundary impacts requires international cooperation and shared responsibility. In 2015, the UN member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, designed to “take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world to a sustainable and resilient path” (UN, 2015 ). The agenda features 17 interconnected Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and 169 targets based on three complementary pillars: social progress, economic development, and environmental protection. The SDG set out a standard baseline level of progress that needs to be achieved and promote integrated approaches, accountability, and data-driven decision-making (UN, 2015 ). The role of the environment and ecosystems is fundamental in directly attaining several goals and targets on water, climate, oceans, and biodiversity (SDG 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively) (Reyers, 2020 ; IPBES et al., 2019 ). The SDG framework recognizes the interlinked nature of the goals and highlights the critical role of the environment in achieving, through indirect interactions, social and economic development for SDG on poverty, hunger, health, cities, education, gender equality, reduced inequalities, and peace (SDG 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, and 16 respectively) (Díaz et al., 2019 ). Monitoring SDG indicators is vital to drive effective action toward environmental sustainability. According to the latest Eurostat monitoring report on progress towards the SDG in the European Union (EU), over the past five years, improved data availability such as SDG 6 ‘Clean water and sanitation’ and SDG 14 ‘Life below water’ at the European level has allowed a better goal-level assessment. Monitoring SDG 6 in the EU context has shown mixed trends in water quality indicators (Eurostat, 2023 ).Improved wastewater treatment has reduced organic pollution in European rivers. However, eutrophication1  1 Eutrophication is the process by which an excess of nutrients – mainly phosphorus and nitrogen – leads to increased growth of plant material, particularly algal blooms, in an aquatic body, resulting in decreased water quality. This can, in turn, cause death by hypoxia of aquatic organisms. Anthropogenic activities, such as farming, agriculture, aquaculture, industry and sewage, are the primary sources of nutrient input in problem areas.   is still a significant concern in EU surface water bodies (EEA, 2018 ). The urgent need for climate action is recognized in SDG 13, as it is a global challenge, increasingly leading to further biodiversity and ecosystem decline (IPCC, 2022 ). Monitoring SDG 13 indicators like the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inside the EU territory showed a decrease of 13.8% over the past five years (2015–2020) (Eurostat, 2023 ). Further progress is required to meet the 55% reduction target of GHG for 2030. Along with SDG 6 and SDG 13, the state of the environment within SDG framework is monitored in SDG 14 ‘Life below water’ and SDG 15 ‘Life on land’. Trends in the EU context on SDG 14 are generally favourable regarding marine conservation but remain mixed regarding ocean health. Marine protected areas have doubled since 2012, but sites conservation status data are still needed. Despite a significant improvement in bathing water quality, EU marine waters are still affected by eutrophication. In 2019, marine waters were classified as eutrophic three times in terms of area compared to 2014 (Eurostat, 2021 ). In addition, chemical pollution, including marine litter and microplastics from both land and sea-based sources, is a significant threat to the marine environment in Europe (EEA, 2019 ). As for “Life on land” tackled in SDG 15, the assessments of the EU's situation showed slight improvements combined with a few adverse developments resulting in declines in biodiversity species abundance and land degradation (European Environment Agency, 2020 ). While the EU's forest area and terrestrial protected areas have increased, pressures on biodiversity continued to intensify (Eurostat, 2023 ). Nevertheless, the depth and complexity of environmental policy progress or shortcomings may not be fully captured by current indicators for monitoring key environmental issues in the EU. Table 1   lists key environmental issues impacting the European Union (EU). These issues encompass a range of ecological challenges that significantly affect biodiversity, ecosystems, and human well-being within the EU region. Each environmental issue is accompanied by a brief description outlining its specific characteristics and associated impacts, reflecting the diverse challenges that warrant attention in environmental management and policy development. Environmental monitoring is crucial role in informing evidence-based policy development and governance systems aimed to achieve the SDG. By providing essential data on environmental trends and pressures, monitoring efforts are a foundational tool for policymakers, governments, and stakeholders to make informed decisions and track progress towards sustainable development. This data-driven approach enables the identification of priority areas, the assessment of policy effectiveness, and the formulation of targeted strategies to address environmental challenges. In practice, environmental monitoring data has been instrumental in guiding the development and implementation of policies aimed at mitigating issues such as eutrophication, climate change, and biodiversity loss, ultimately contributing to the advancement of the SDG. Although environmental monitoring is a concept that transcends geographical boundaries, much like climate change, it is still necessary to find suitable methodologies for its monitoring across various levels. Understanding and addressing the spatial heterogeneity of resource availability and ecological pressures at the regional scale is crucial to implementing better effective management strategies, developing local capacity, and tailoring targeted policies to different regions’ specific needs and challenges (Patole, 2018 ). Monitoring progress toward the SDG related to the environment requires data collection, rigorous analysis, and transparent reporting. This multifaceted process often requires various stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, and the private sector, to work together to develop and implement indicators, collect data, and use that data to track progress towards achieving the goals. The current body of literature offers limited evidence regarding the optimal approaches for environmental monitoring per the specific territorial focus or research objectives. These limitations prompt essential questions regarding the challenges and prospects associated with regional-level environmental monitoring, indicators and data gaps at the EU level using the SDG framework. In pursuit of this inquiry, the paper aims to systematically assess the current status of environmental monitoring at the regional level in Europe, focusing on identifying key concepts, available tools, and policy priorities. By examining a diverse range of indicators used by regions, the objective is to provide insights into regional environmental and sustainability policy priorities and assess the effectiveness of current monitoring frameworks. In this sense, the paper seeks to address the need for a comprehensive understanding of regional environmental monitoring practices and offer recommendations for improving the existing framework.  2 Related work on environmental monitoring According to the literature, the methods and indicators used by the scientific community to monitor the environment vary depending on the specific ecosystem or environmental issue studied, the specific research question addressed, and the resources available to the research team or community. However, several standard methods are frequently used in environmental monitoring, most notably.1. Field surveys and biodiversity monitoring: This category encompasses field surveys and biodiversity monitoring methods aimed at quantifying and tracking plant and animal species diversities within specific ecosystems. It also involves direct fieldwork to assess the health and composition of ecosystems (Whitworth et al., 2017 ; Ciambra et al., 2023b ).  2. Water quality assessment and monitoring: Water quality assessment and monitoring methods focus on evaluating the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of water bodies, encompassing monitoring, testing, and analysis of parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrient levels, and pollutant concentrations(Köster, 2003 ; Verma and Singh, 2013 ).  3. Air Quality monitoring and pollution assessment: Air quality monitoring and pollution assessment involves measuring levels of pollutants such as particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide, and other contaminants. This is important for understanding the impact of human activities on air quality and identifying potential health risks (Völgyesi, 2008 ; Engel-Cox et al., 2013 ; Spinelle et al., 2015 ).  4. Remote sensing and space monitoring: Remote sensing involves using satellite imagery, space-based monitoring systems or other remote sensing technologies to monitor changes in land use, vegetation cover, and other environmental indicators over time (Kerr and Ostrovsky, 2003 ; Wang et al., 2010 ; Newton et al., 2009 ).  5. Citizen science and community-based monitoring: Citizen science and community-based monitoring engage public participation in environmental monitoring efforts, including activities such as biodiversity surveys, water quality testing, and tracking the distribution of invasive species (Adler et al., 2020 ; Brown and Williams, 2019 ).  6. Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER): LTER is a program that supports studying ecological systems over long periods, typically ten years or more. This type of research is essential for understanding how ecosystems change over time and how they respond to environmental stressors (Müller et al., 2010 ; Michener et al., 2011 ).    In terms of indicators, there is a plethora of those reported in the scientific and grey literature. The most prominent ones relate to the notions of quality (water, soil, or air) or those of change versus a previous state (Ciambra et al., 2023 ). Overall, the specific indicators used for environmental monitoring will depend on the research question being addressed and the particular ecosystem or environmental issue being studied. The sources for collecting data on these indicators will depend on the type of indicator and the scale of the study. Theycan include a combination of remote sensing, direct observation, or citizen science. In the reviewed pertinent literature, we found the following indicators with a recurring frequency; however, the list is not exhaustive but only indicative of how the concept, idea, or even political priority of environmental monitoring can be on the field.1. Species richness and diversity: This indicator measures the number of species in a particular area and how evenly they are distributed. It is typically measured through biodiversity surveys conducted by trained scientists or citizen scientists using standardized methods (McDonald, 2023 ; Bhavan et al., 2023 ).  2. Population abundance and distribution: This refers to the number of individuals of a particular species in a given area and their spatial distribution. Population abundance and distribution can be measured through direct observation or by using statistical models to estimate population size from indirect indicators such as counts of tracks (Said et al., 2016 ; Maron and Crone, 2006 ; Acevedo et al., 2014 ).  3. Habitat quality and extent: This indicator measures the quality and extent of suitable habitat for a particular species or species. Habitat quality can be assessed through physical measures such as soil quality, vegetation cover, or crucial habitat features like nest sites or burrows (Cabral et al., 2016 ; Mortelliti et al., 2010 ). Habitat extent can be assessed using remote sensing techniques such as satellite imagery or ground-based surveys.  4. Water quality: This indicator measures the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of water and can include measures such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrient levels, and levels of pollutants (Patil, 2012 ; Gorde and Jadhav, 2013 ). Water quality can be monitored through regular testing of water samples, which can be done by trained scientists or citizen scientists using handheld test kits.  5. Air quality: This indicator measures the level of pollutants in the air, which can include particulate matter, ozone, and carbon monoxide. Air quality can be monitored through regular sampling of air, which can be done using stationary monitoring stations or portable equipment (WHO, 2021 ; Wang et al., 2019 ).  6. Land use and land cover: This indicator measures changes in the use and cover of land over time, including changes in vegetation, urbanization, and agricultural practices (Turner et al., 1995 ; Verburg et al., 2006 ). Land use and land cover can be monitored using remote sensing techniques such as satellite imagery or ground-based surveys.  7. Ecological disturbance: This indicator measures the frequency, severity, and spatial extent of disturbances such as wildfires, floods, or human activities (Banks et al., 2013 ; Laegdsgaard, 2006 ). Ecological disturbances can be monitored using remote sensing techniques, aerial surveys, or ground-based surveys.    Alternatively, and deployed in this paper, among the plethora of indicators and tools used for environmental monitoring, the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) stands out as a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate environmental sustainability and track progress across key policy objectives (Smallenbroek et al., 2023 ). Regardless of the method(s) and indicator(s) chosen, there is a growing body of work on the monitoring of the SDG and their relationship with environmental systems (Reyers, 2020 ; IPBES et al., 2019 ; Selomane et al., 2019 ). One key area of research and practice is the development of indicators to track progress toward SDG targets related to environmental sustainability. Several organizations are working to develop and implement indicators for monitoring progress towards SDG targets related to environmental sustainability, but mainly at the national level. For example, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the custodian agency for SDG15, has developed a set of global indicators for tracking progress towards SDG 15 (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021 ), and the World Bank has developed a set of environmental indicators to track progress towards several SDG, including those related to environmental sustainability (World Bank, 2023 ). Table 2   presents an overview of how the SDG framework can be used to monitor the environment, literature examples of how different SDG are related to environment, and how indicators can be used to monitor progress towards their targets.  3 Materials and methods Global/Country-level indicators enable comparison between contexts but may mask regional and local specifications, needs and capacities (Tan et al., 2019 ). The last report published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on measuring the progress: Environment and SDG highlighted the need to fill data gaps related to the environmental indicators, and disaggregate data to local scales. SDG localisation extends beyond the simple local application of the global agenda; it requires the development of locally adapted indicators for local monitoring and decision-making. For this reason, the starting point of this paper is the framework of regional SDG indicators developed and validated in 10 European regions within the pilot project "Regions2030: monitoring the SDG in the EU regions - filling the data gaps”, carried out by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). 3.1 Study extent The study area is located in the western, central, and southern parts of Europe, spread over 10 European regions of the REGIONS2030 project: Nord-Vest (Romania), Pomorskie (Poland), North Aegean (Greece), Western Macedonia (Greece), Navarre (Spain), Andalucia (Spain), Piedmont (Italy), Apulia (Italy), Centro (Portugal), and TR33 (Turkey) (Fig. 1  ). The study area is a diverse region with various socio-economic and environmental conditions. The area covers a diverse landscape, including coastal areas, mountain ranges, and inland plains, facing several common challenges related to climate change, water and air quality, demographic growth, and biodiversity loss. Eight pilot regions are located in Southern Europe. TR33 region in Turkey is landlocked in the Northern Aegean part of Türkiye (population density: 69,7 inhabitants/km2 , divided into four provinces. North Aegean is the second smallest Region in Greece, consisting of 10 islands with a low population density of 55,8 inhabitants/km2 . The Region of Western Macedonia is a border landlocked region in Greece with a very low population density (28 inhabitants/km2 ), known to be the energy production centre of Greece due to the high number of power plants. The Piedmont and Apulia regions are both located in Italy. Piedmont is a landlocked area in North-western Italy, with a population density of 169.6 inhabitants/km2 , divided into seven provinces and one metropolitan city, Torino. Apulia is a densely populated coastal region in south-eastern Italy, (203.6 inhabitants/km2 ) and divided into five provinces and one metropolitan city, Bari. Navarre, located in northern Spain (population density: 63,6 inhabitants/km2 ), is considered one of the most developed economies in Spain. Andalucía region in Southern Spain is divided into eight provinces, with a population density of 98,1 inhabitants/km2 ), relying mainly on the services and tourism sector. The Centro Region is one of the seven main regions of Portugal, located in the central part of the country (79,9 inhabitants/km2 ). It comprises of eight sub-regions, with an agricultural sector and one of the regions with the highest renewable energy production in Portugal. Two pilot regions are located in Central Eastern Europe. The Pomorskie region in Poland has a population density of 120.8 inhabitants/km2 , higher than the Nord-Vest region of Romania (74.4 inhabitants per square kilometre). The main economic activity in the Pomorskie region is agriculture and, tourism, and agriculture in the Nord-Vest region.  3.2 Methodology The methodology of this paper is summarized as follows.1. The starting point is the outcome of the REGIONS2030 pilot project:a. Collection of the available and accessible data from various sources, including national statistical institutes. European sources are generally given preference due to their standardized and consistent nature to enable the comparison of calculation methods among regions (Vega Rapun et al., 2022 ).  b. Identification of SDG indicators that require a customized approach (Siragusa et al., 2022 );  c. Proposal of additional and alternative indicators from relevant databases reflecting the particularities of the regions or complement for missing data.     2. Collection of data and metadata for the indicator set from 10 pilot regions.  3. Analysis of trends and gaps for the goals and available indicators.  4. Identification of challenges and recommendations for environmental monitoring using SDG framework at a regional scale.    The approach employed in this paper draws from the structure and methodology of the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) used in the JRC audit of the Environmental Performance Index 2022 (Smallenbroek et al., 2023 ). The EPI is designed to evaluate environmental sustainability and aggregates into three overarching policy objectives: Environmental Health, Ecosystem Vitality, and Climate Change. The categorization serves to simplify complex environmental data, aligns with global policy priorities, and provides a practical framework for tracking progress toward these goals. Environmental Health focuses on issues related to human well-being, including air and water quality, directly linked to public health. Ecosystem Vitality addresses the health and sustainability of ecosystems, which are crucial for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Climate Change encompasses indicators related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate mitigation. By adopting this structured approach, we aim to comprehensively assess the environmental dimensions relevant to the Agenda 2030 framework. Of the 17 indicators out of the 83 that were considered related to the environmental monitoring of the SDG, only 11 indicators were considered in this paper for which reliable and regular data are available at the NUTS level and relevant for regional comparability (Table 3  ).   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Ecosystem vitality The state of the environment, known as ecosystem vitality, encompasses the state of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. It is addressed through several SDG targets, including the freshwater resources state (6.3), the protection and restoration of marine resources (14.1, 14.5), the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems (15.1, 15.5), and the promotion of sustainable agriculture and land use (15.1). Europe's freshwater ecosystems face multiple challenges and pressures driven by water pollution, water abstractions, droughts, floods, and physical alterations such as land drainage, soil erosion, dams, and channelization, posing a barrier to sustainable development (European Environment Agency, 2020 ). The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is the European legislation that aims to protect and restore water bodies. It requires EU Member States to achieve good status in all bodies of surface water (ecological and chemical status) and groundwater (chemical and quantitative status). In this paper, data for the indicator on the share of groundwater that exceeds a standardized quality rating was mainly unavailable and inaccessible at the regional level. As an essential drinking source in Europe, monitoring groundwater status is crucial. 18% of groundwater bodies in 24 member states reported poor chemical status mainly due to high levels of nitrates linked to agricultural activities (EEA, 2018 ). The water quality monitoring of surface water, is based on a defined set of ecological and physicochemical parameters with a confidence rating related to the number of parameters measured, frequency of data collection, and proportion of the water body monitored. However, due to the lack of a comprehensive series of suitable data at the NUTS 2 level in the scope of this paper, the indicator 6.3 on water bodies that exceed a standardized quality rating was only compared across 4 out of 10 regions. Regional data displays differences in the temporal coverage, while Navarre and Nord Vest regions have regular status assessments showing stable and decreasing trends respectively; the, Apulia region only had data for 2015 (Fig. 2  ). In addition, status and main pressures vary widely across water basins and may not be accurately reflected in the average regional status. Disaggregated data at the basin level allows for the identification of significant pressures and their resulting impacts, mainly when dealing with transboundary water bodies, such as the case of the Andalucia region. Data for Andalucia were available for six river basins, three of which are intra-region (Cuencas Mediterráneas Andaluzas; Tinto, Odiel y Piedras; and Guadalete y Barbate), and three are shared with other regions (Guadalquivir, Guadiana, and Segura). Only the Guadalquivir basin was considered in this paper, given that 90.2 % of its surface area is in Andalucía, while only 10% of the other basins are within the Andalucian region. Disaggregated data shows a high variability across basins, both in terms of surface water and groundwater quality, which implies different measures and integrated management strategies by local authorities. (Fig. 3  ). To ensure sustainable water use, ecosystem protection, and the well-being of communities, as well as establish integrated management strategies, it is crucial to monitor both water quality and quantity. Tracking the changes in the extent of different types of freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands, over a specific period is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and restoration efforts at the regional level. Wetlands are critical to ensure water availability (Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, 2018 ); therefore, monitoring “wetlands of international importance” is suggested as an additional indicator by the Piedmont region. The sustainable use and conservation of wetlands, as guided by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, will be critical in helping achieve different SDG targets (Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, 2022). The quality of inland surface water directly affects the quality of marine water through the flow of pollutants, nutrients, and contaminants downstream into coastal areas, compromising the biodiversity and ecological balance of marine ecosystems, which is tackled by SDG 14. The EU faces pressure on the quality of coastal water, which is affected by land-based pollution from various sources like industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, inadequate wastewater treatment, and surface runoff. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the coastal water quality on the shore and the transitional water allowing a broader view of exerted pollution pressure. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires Member States to reduce pollution, promote sustainable water management practices, and monitor water quality to protect, restore, and achieve good environmental status (quality parameters) of EU coastal areas. However, it is inevitable to acknowledge the regional differences in individual pressures and a consistent and standardized interpretation of water quality assessment approaches (EEA, 2019 ). In this paper, the marine ecosystem state is reflected through three regional indicators, as per the following: (i) share of estuarine water with high/very high water quality, (ii) share of coastal water with high/very high water quality, and (iii) protected coastal areas as percentage of total coastal area. Data was mainly inaccessible except for the Centro Region, which has only 5.4% of its total coastal area stated as protected but achieved good water quality in both transitional and coastal waters (Fig. 4  ). As stated in the Eurostat (2023)  report (Eurostat, 2023 ), the percentage of protected areas alone does not provide enough information on connectivity, status, and conservation measures. Such indicators could be combined with assessing of the efficiency of management plans. As for landlocked regions, anticipatory approaches can be applied by reducing the sea pollution from tributaries and transboundary cooperation towards regulations on preserving and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources. As most of the polluting plastic flows from rivers into oceans, Target 14.1 requires significantly reducing marine pollution, particularly from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution, by 2025. Apulia region highlighted an additional indicator, “marine beach waste”, defined as the number of items (disposable plastics, waste related to fishing and aquaculture, plastic bags, and waste about smoking) per 100 m of coastline. The National Institute for Environmental Research measures this indicator in Italy as part of the marine strategy for pollution control policy and greater awareness campaigns. To effectively address and mitigate environmental challenges, integrated management strategies can considerthe interconnectedness of marine and terrestrial ecosystems and the ecosystem continuum. Over 80% of protected habitat types were classified as poor due to land and sea use changes, organisms exploitation, climate change, pollution, and invasive species, all underscoring the alarming need to increase conservation efforts (European Environment Agency, 2020 ). The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (European Commission, 2020a,b ), a key pillar of the European Green Deal, is a long-term plan to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, reverse the degradation of ecosystems and legally protect a minimum of 30% of the EU's land area by 2030. Data on percentages of forest areas at the regional scale showed stable trends within the regions between 2015 and 2021. However, they ranged across regions with higher percentages in Centro, Navarre, and Andalucía. Meanwhile, the percentages of terrestrial protected areas varied across regions, showing higher values in Pomorskie (Mrozowska, 2023 ), Piedmont and Apulia regions (Fig. 5  ). As reported by the Apulia region, new protected areas registration is a lengthy bureaucratic process that takes years and makes it challenging to assess short-term trends. Additionally, it is necessary to monitor the percentage of forest area subject to sustainable management instruments, as underlined by the Andalucia region. This additional indicator tackles the progress towards sustainable forest management to protect forest resources, ecosystem services, and biodiversity and ensure higher productivity, profitability, conservation, and adaptation to climate change. The Piedmont region is covered by mountain territory for about 50% of its area. It is working towards the strategy for the sustainable development of Piedmont's mountains to enhance the natural and forestry resources of the mountains from environmental and socio-economic points of view. Therefore, Piedmont suggested two additional indicators: (i) “Mountain vegetation index” for a sustainable development of the forest-wood chain, and (ii) “Impact of forest fires rate” to strengthen prevention and forests' resilience to climate-related hazards. While the EU's forest area and terrestrial protected areas have slightly increased, pressures on biodiversity continue to intensify due to the expansion of intensive agriculture and urban areas at the expense of forests, wetlands, and grasslands. These land use changes have also led to soil erosion by water, one of Europe's most widespread forms of soil degradation. Since it is complex to measure at large scales, soil erosion indicators at the regional level were estimated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) empirical computer model (Renard et al., 1997 ). Soil erosion is estimated to be severe in Piedmont (>10 t ha−1  yr−1 ), higher than recommended sustainable rates in EU (>2 5 t ha−1  yr−1 ) in Andalucia (Quintanilla Cabañero, 2023 ), Nord Vest (Pop, 2023 ) and Navarre (Osés-Eraso, 2023 ), North Aegean, Western Macedonia (Koutsomarkos, 2023 ), Apulia (Armenise, 2023 ), and Centro (Abreu, 2023 ) (Fig. 6  ). Agro-environmental policies are among the most effective mechanisms to offset this trend and the potential future increase in soil erosion rates due to climate change (Panagos, 2021 ). Europe's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) sets requirements to protect agricultural areas against erosion, such as applying cover crops in soil erosion hotspots and limited soil disturbance measures to mitigate the negative impacts of unsustainable farming management and prevent soil erosion.  4.2 Environmental health Sustainable development recognizes the interdependence of the ecological balance and the well-being of humans and animals. Healthy and balanced ecosystems provide numerous ecosystem services that play a crucial role in supporting and promoting human health through provisioning services (food, clean water), regulating services (air quality, water flow), supporting services (pollination, sustainable agriculture), resilience and adaptation (climate change and extreme events). Different SDG targets address the environmental health directly related to human health, particularly in cities: sanitation and drinking water (6.3), air quality (11.6), and waste generation (12.4). The EEA report on air quality in Europe 2021) (European Environment Agency, 2021 ) stated that air pollution is the most significant environmental health risk in Europe, linked to adverse health effects like respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and premature deaths. Pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) can penetrate the respiratory system but also contribute to the formation of acid rain and climate change. Disaggregating air pollution indicators at the regional scale is crucial to identify hotspots and trends and establish regional strategies accordingly. PM2.5  emissions indicator was provided at the NUTS 2 level from the GAINS model (JRC LUISA Reference Scenario 2016). On the one hand, it shows the high variability across regions within the country, like Navarre and Andalucia in Spain and Apulia and Piedmont in Italy (Lella, 2023 ). On the other hand, data between 2015, 2020 and the projected 2030, show a decreasing trend in all regions but most significantly in Western Macedonia, where it was reduced by 31% between 2015 and 2020 (Fig. 7  ). The Zero Pollution Action Plan has set a target for the EU to reduce by more than 55% the health impacts of air pollution by 2030, to be achieved through PM2.5  emissions reduction (EU Action Plan: Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil, 2021). Despite improvements, 97% of the European urban population was still exposed to harmful levels of PM2.5  above 5 μg/m3 , according to the World Health Organization (WHO) new air quality guideline in 2020 (WHO, 2021 ). Data on PM2.5  concentration available in Apulia and Andalucia regions show levels above the WHO standards but below the EU standards set at 25 μg/m3. However, the Ambient Air quality directive is being revised to align the EU standards with the WHO recommendations. It categorizes air quality as good, fair, moderate, poor, and very poor (Fig. 8  ). Both regions indicate concentrations above the limit established by the WHO, which are classified as moderate according to the EU standards. Andalucia shows a decreasing trend, reflecting the effectiveness of regional strategies implemented, such as the Andalusian Action Plan for Climate and the Andalucian Air Quality Plan. In contrast, the Apulia region shows a more stable trend in the past five years. Furthermore, pollution from generated waste in cities is another main threat to the environment and human health. Among the waste generated in the EU in 2020, 4.4 % were classified as hazardous waste, which increased by 5.1 % compared to 2010. Hazardous waste, by definition, is waste with one or more hazardous properties listed in Annex III of the EU's Waste Framework Directive WFD (Directive, 2008/98/EC ). It poses a greater risk to the environment and human health than other types of waste if not managed and disposed of safely. The WFD requires the separate collection of households' hazardous waste by 2025. In addition to the EU legislation, the European Commission's circular economy action plan commits to waste reduction targets by 2025. More particularly, 55% of municipal and 65% of packaging waste must be reused or recycled. Available data on hazardous waste generation indicators at the regional scale showed the highest values with an increasing trend in the Piedmont region. In contrast, other regions (Apulia, Navarre, Andalucia and Centro) had significantly lower values and more stable figures (Fig. 9  ). These indicators, combined with data on waste disaggregated by sources and waste treatment, reflect the existing gaps and opportunities towards promoting integrated and differentiated management plans, reducing waste's environmental and health impacts, improving material and energy recovery and sustainable consumption. The waste framework directive established a waste hierarchy to be applied: (1) prevention, (2) preparing for reuse, (3) recycling, (4) other recovery like energy recovery, and (5) disposal through landfills. The Centro region measures the percentage of urban solid waste prepared for reuse and recycling as a proportion of the total urban solid waste collected, which, according to the waste framework directive, needs to be around 60% by 2030. The Piedmont region measures the percentage of urban waste sent to landfills out of total urban waste collected, which should be reduced to a maximum of 10% by 2030, according to the EU circular economy action plan (VR). On the other hand, the Piedmont region pointed out the importance of measuring the incidence of tourism on waste to develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable tourism. Regions attractive for tourism, like Piedmont, face environmental challenges such as waste generation, huge water and energy consumption for artificial snow (ski-related tourism), widespread urbanization, and pollution. This issue is tackled in the General Plan for Sustainable Tourism in Andalucía. It is measured through an additional indicator, “Local tourism intensity”, to assess the balance between the economic and social development of tourism and the preservation of the environment and local culture.  4.3 Climate change Ecosystems are rapidly changing in response to climate change, manifested in changes of temperature and precipitation patterns, water balance, ocean chemistry, and the frequency and magnitude of extreme events (IPCC, 2022 ). SDG 13 highlights climate change as a critical issue and emphasizes the need to take urgent actions supported by numerous policies to prioritize climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG emissions. The European Green Deal has defined the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. Overall, EU emissions in 2021 were 29.7 % lower than 1990 levels, but the speed of reduction needs to increase significantly to meet the 2050 target (European Commission, 2023 ). Climate goals are set at a national and international level, yet their accomplishment requires the involvement of local governments that must adapt to the implied changes. In 2022, over 10.000 signatories to the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy committed to reducing GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 (European Commission, 2020 , 2023 ). To support the EU's decarbonisation goals, it is therefore crucial to assess CO2  emission inventories at local scales to provide a robust starting point and enable discussions towards designing focussed policies and fostering behavioural changes (Moran et al., 2022 ). Data presented in this paper on CO2  emissions is taken from the JRC model (Jacobs-Crisioni et al., 2017 ). The LUISA modelling platform is designed to assist in the understanding of the territorial characteristics and territorial trends throughout Europe and supports the policy making process (Jacobs-Crisioni et al., 2017 ). CO2  emissions per capita at the regional scale in Western Macedonia were higher than in the rest of the regions; a downward trend between 2015 and 2020, and an upward trend between 2020 and 2030 are noted across all regions (Fig. 10  ). Some regions like Andalucia have access to data on CO2 emissions collected annually by the Spanish Emission Inventory System of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (REDIAM) by anthropogenic sources and their removal by sinks, as provided for the Framework Convention on Climate Change-UNFCCC (GCOS, UN, 2006 ) and its Kyoto Protocol (1997)  and Regulation (EU) 525/2013 (European Parliament and European Council, 2018 ). These data show a downward trend of emitted CO2  between 2015 and 2020, and present significant differences with the LUISA model output (Fig. 11  ). There is a great need for harmonized assessment methods (direct and indirect emission sources, computational approaches) across regions to ensure EU-level comparability and goal achievement. Collecting data for indicators on GHG emissions (non-CO2 ), carbon footprint, and net removals of CO2  by land use changes and forestry are also inevitable to design efficient action plans at regional scales, which underlines the need for capacity building for environmental data collection and management. In addition to monitoring GHG emissions, SDG 13 tackles disaster risk reduction at the local level to strengthen resilience to climate-related hazards, in line with the Climate Adaptation Strategy by the EU. The Piedmont region measures “population exposed to the risk of floods and landslides areas per km2”, to reduce the exposure of vulnerable populations to climate-related extreme events and disasters.   5 Conclusions It is now widely apparent and acknowledged worldwide that sustainability relies on a balance between economic, social, environmental and institutional development, locally and globally. From an environmental point of view, it is crucial to adopt a system thinking and integrated approach that recognizes the linkages and interactions between the elements comprising the entire ecosystem. This approach is reflected to a certain extent in the SDG framework that acknowledges the multi-dimensional and multiscale nature of ecosystems, environmental and human health. Therefore, this paper builds upon the previous efforts in designing regional SDG monitoring tools and the gained scientific knowledge from the pilot project Regions2030. To improve environmental monitoring at the regional scale while highlighting evidence-based common gaps and opportunities, our work examined environmental SDG indicators across regions, focusing on three policy objectives: Ecosystem Vitality, Environmental Health, and Climate Change. The findings point out a broad diversity of local specificities among regions, leading to various challenges and opportunities for implementing Agenda2030. Environmental monitoring using the SDG framework relies on reliable, standardized, and accessible data, enabling better-informed decision-making, comprehensive trend analysis, and a deeper understanding of regional dynamics at both national and European levels. The lack of adequate available data (e.g. SDG 6 and 14) and the absence of transparent and open access data pinpoints the necessity to enhance monitoring and the data-sharing dynamics to encourage collaboration and evidence-based discussions among governmental agencies, organizations, researchers, and the public. On the other hand, some indicators (e.g. SDG 13) are not supported by long time series, limiting the robust analyses of trends and dynamics. It is essential to acknowledge the time lags between implemented policies and actions and the observable effects on ecological processes in short-term analyses, such as the case of protected areas and the status of conservations (SDG 15). While ecosystems and anthropogenic actions do not respect administrative boundaries, reporting disaggregated data by geographic area and event, among others, allows decision-makers to tailor their strategies based on a better understanding of heterogeneity, specific challenges, and needs within each territory. It seems crucial to have homogenous methodologies and definitions of indicators to ensure comparability regarding environmental quality assessment across different spatial scales. Science-based common standards are well understood for indicators like water quality (SDG 6 and 14), but are often faced with a lack of comprehensive series of relevant data at regional and watershed scales. Moreover, defining targets at a national and regional scale requires regular revisions to align different standards across regions (e.g., SDG 11 on air quality). There is a strong need for robust analytical tools to explore new data science techniques, like geospatial data, citizen science, modelling tools, and artificial intelligence, to fill data gaps by providing fine spatio-temporal data. Given the diversity of data collection methods and existing data products from technologies like remote sensing, it is crucial to enhance the capacity building of local stakeholders on data collection, data management, and data analysis. This is particularly necessary for SDG 13 indicators (i.e. GHG emissions or carbon footprint) lacking proper methodology and skills to be monitored efficiently by local actors. Connecting the global SDG with locally specific actions requires regional strategies that better account for the local environment and needs, such as the impact of the emerging tourism industry reported by several regions in this paper. This highlights the need to integrate regional objectives within the European ones and to align bottom-up and top-down approaches as a promising opportunity to enable synergies between global and national environmental objectives. Furthermore, our findings suggest the urgent need for a dynamic set of indicators, a context-specific approach, and more efforts required to monitor the environment at the regional scale. Lastly, cooperation among different entities and stakeholders on one side and collaborations with other regions on the other side can accelerate the integrated approach of environmental monitoring at local scales by addressing common challenges via new indicators and exchanging successful strategies. While the paper has provided insights into the diverse range of environmental SDG indicators used across regions, it is essential to acknowledge the potential for future research to explore the concept of indicator coherence and conduct a comparative assessment of regional versus institutional-level indicators. This analysis could offer insights into how regions may diverge from established institutional metrics and could shed light on the implications of adapting and refining centralized monitoring frameworks. Such a research direction could elicit an exercise in accountability and adaptation on the part of monitoring institutions, promoting the evolution of global monitoring frameworks and enhancing the understanding of regional contributions to SDG monitoring. Finally, in light of the paper's findings, it is imperative to integrate a focused policy analysis to underscore the critical role of environmental monitoring in informing evidence-based policy decisions, guiding regulatory frameworks, and facilitating effective governance strategies. The implications of the paper's findings for policy development and the alignment of regional environmental objectives with broader national and global sustainability targets highlight the need to integrate environmental monitoring as a cornerstone of policy formulation and implementation. This policy analysis component emphasizes the significance of harmonizing regional and national policy frameworks with the broader sustainability agenda, emphasizing the mutual reinforcement of local and global environmental objectives. Furthermore, the paper underscores the need for future-oriented development directions in environmental monitoring, emphasizing the integration of innovative methodologies, data science techniques, and collaborative frameworks to address existing data gaps, enhance spatio-temporal data acquisition, and support informed decision-making at local and regional scales. This emphasis on future development directions highlights the imperative of capacity building, technology adoption, and interdisciplinary collaborations to advance environmental monitoring practices and meet the evolving demands of sustainable development. By proactively addressing these aspects, it is possible to strategically position environmental monitoring as a catalyst for shaping future environmental policies and actions, fostering sustainable development, and driving positive environmental outcomes.
