               With the emerging global socioeconomic and environmental apprehensions appear the significance of “sustainability science” in terms of a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach toward addressing major present-day concerns. The United Nation’s 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) under Agenda 2030 are an attempt to promote and ensure such holistic advancements. Soil, as a central component of the environment, is connected directly or indirectly to a number of SDGs. For instance, soil health and functions have substantial implications in SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being for people), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (Life below water), and SDG 15 (Life on land). In this chapter, we attempt to explore the attributes of each of these SDG in connection with the soil and how soil sustainability could influence or aid in achieving sustainable development. We argue that soil conservation is one of the most vital and essential ways toward realizing the objectives of SDGs both effectively and adequately.

Thus in this definition, realizing the needs of the present generations is  highlighted at an equal scale with the needs of the future generation (Strezov et al., 2017 ). The broader approach to sustainability as defined in the Brundtland Report keeps the composition relevant even after 30 years of its publication. As Holden et al. (2014, pp. 130–132, 138)  argue:Sustainable development is increasingly being presented as a pathway to all that is good and desirable in society […] Four primary dimensions have been derived from the Brundtland Report: safeguarding long-term ecological sustainability, satisfying basic human needs, and promoting intragenerational and intergenerational equity […] The Brundtland Report identifies a much broader spectrum of issues to be covered by sustainable development, including political, social, economic, and cultural issues. Thus, sustainability includes more than environmental sustainability […] No country meets the thresholds for all four dimensions; that is, no country has currently achieved sustainable development, and some countries are far off the target. Thus, the thought of actually achieving sustainable development may seem overwhelming.   In the 21st century society, the concerns associated with “sustainability” is recognized as a vital issue globally (Komiyama and Takeuchi, 2006 ). Most countries are engaged in formulating and implementing serious and thoughtful policy suggestions to attain sustainable development. Accordingly, during the last two decades, “sustainability science” has attracted major research and policy attention as a promising arena of innovation and enquiry. With its origin in the Brundtland Report, the field of sustainability science primarily “seeks to understand the fundamental character of interactions between nature and society”. A number of leading universities and research institutions worldwide have directed their focus of attention to sustainability science and its methods. Sustainability science, today, has developed into a recognizable realm for scientific subsidy (Ziegler and Ott, 2011 ). In the academic and scientific arena globally, there has never been a better opportunity to advance the emergent discipline of sustainability science as it is during the last two decades (Komiyama and Takeuchi, 2006 ). Toward investigating the distinction of sustainability science, it is essential to scrutinize ways of defining a particular problem and examine methodological queries (Ziegler and Ott, 2011 ). A considerable number of obstacles and practical elements should be taken into consideration while attempting to make the notion of  sustainable development tangible. Accordingly, the novel paradigm of sustainability science should essentially be capable of encompassing diverse actors (interests), multiple balances (dynamics), different extents of scales (of space, time, and function), and various failures (systemic faults) (Martens, 2006 ). The very concept of sustainability science does not find itself effortlessly suitable with conventional criteria of the values of science (Ziegler and Ott, 2011 ). As Wiek et al. (2012, pp. 1–2)  argue:[…] Against this background, the community of sustainability scientists is confronted with two essential questions. First, what is a reasonable mission for sustainability science, considering that research and education are valuable but not sufficient contributions to solving sustainability problems? Second, recognizing these constraints, how can sustainability science optimally contribute to solving sustainability problems, and what are the necessary changes in personal attitudes and institutional structures to support these efforts?   Since the year 2000, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have focused on aspects of sustainable development and ways to achieve the same. For instance, in the context of developing countries, reducing extreme poverty has been a pioneering aim of MDGs (Griggs et al., 2013 ). One important aspect to be noted here is the fact that the focus of MDGs was solely on the developing countries (Gil et al., 2018 ). In the year 2014, a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was proposed by the United Nations (UN) member states for the period between 2015 and 2030 with an aim to succeed the MDGs and set them as “reference goals” for the international community (Le blanc, 2015 ). Under the purview of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UN adopted the 17 SDGs and advised the scientific community worldwide to produce sound information with the purpose of supporting both the planning and monitoring of socioeconomic development intertwining with the environmental sustainability aspects (Tóth et al., 2018 ). Thus following the MDGs, the international community had established a fresh set of ambitious targets and goals in the year 2015, which is considered as the first multinational development agenda ever proposed toward guiding the actions of each nation in the quest for a better world (Gil et al., 2018 ). Accordingly, the MDGs were superseded in the recent past by the SDGs and, different from their precursors, are applied to all countries irrespective of their level or status of development (Mann et al., 2018 ). The 17 SDGs and 169 associated targets were set toward attaining sustainable development. Nevertheless, Zimm et al. (2018)  argue that although the  SDGs should ideally be pursued in an integrative and inclusive manner, there happen to be presently no comprehensive and unified development pathways that could achieve the 17 SDGs. A comprehensive deliberation of the features of urgency, the inclusion of nonscientists, normativity, and collaboration of social and natural scientists advocates a substantial case for robust sustainability (Ziegler and Ott, 2011 ). As a first step, policymakers must embrace an integrated social and environmental framework aimed at the SDGs so as to ensure that “today’s advances in development are not lost as our planet ceases to function for the benefit of a global population” (Griggs et al., 2013 ). One positive aspect is that the 17 SDGs are all-encompassing of the developed countries, as it is essential (and the only way) to undertake intensive and determined actions among all the countries to accomplish prosperity without intimidating the planetary boundaries (Gil et al., 2018 ). “Soil” finds a considerable significance in the sustainable development goals. A number of SDGs are directly or indirectly associated with soil. Soil contributes to the primary needs of mankind in the form of clean air, clean water, and food, and is a key carrier for biodiversity (Keesstra et al., 2016 ). Subjecting to their biological, chemical, and physical attributes, soil plays a vital role in the ecosystem services’ provision. These attributes are shaped by a combination of anthropogenic and natural factors (Zambon et al., 2018 ). For instance, Lal (2018)  argues that soils of the Global South and particularly of Africa are vulnerable to global warming and degradation. These soils have low plant-available nutrient and water reserves, weak soil structure, and low soil organic carbon contents (Lal, 2018 ). Accordingly, the soil is considered as an element toward achieving the SDGs. On particular, SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being for people), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 13 (Climate action), SDG 14 (Life below water), and SDG 15 (Life on land) allude to targets that suggest direct reference of soil resources (Tóth et al., 2018 ). Further, all the other SDGs have indirect relevance to soil science.  17.2 “Soil” in the Sustainable Development Goals It has been three decades since its first global appearance in the Brundtland Commission’s Report of 1987, still the pursuit of “sustainable development” persists high on policy schemas right from the regional up to the global level (Mann et al., 2018 ). Thus the concept of sustainable developments continues to establish its relevance in the present-day  world and the SDGs are designed as a few contemporary approaches to achieve the same. The SDGs could directly be connected to clear goals associated with land-related science with an extensive societal focus. This has the potential to contribute to outstanding prospects for soil science to demonstrate its decisive role in the accomplishment of several land-related SDGs (Bouma, 2018 ). Further, incessantly appearing persistent environmental concerns such as land degradation and natural resource exploitation emphasize on the necessity of a systemic understanding of social and environmental apprehensions together with the formation of robust policy and management resolutions (Mann et al., 2018 ). In the 21st century’s globalized world, soil sustainability relies not only on the management selections by the land planners, foresters, and farmers but also on the political decisions on marketing and subsidies, rules, and regulations, with public perceptions as the most significant subject (Keesstra et al., 2016 ). As argued by Lal (2018) ,Soil degradation is a serious issue in the tropics and sub-tropics because of the harsh climate, fragile soils, resource-poor small landholders, and the widespread extractive soil management and low agronomic productivity in the developing countries, humid tropics. These problems are aggravated by the high rainfall, wind or climate erosivity in the region which can cause a serious economic loss. Similarly, soil salinization is a major problem, and the risks of salinization may be aggravated by climate change, especially in semi-arid regions and coastal areas. Depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration and stock may also increase with increase in temperature due to the projected warming causing a positive feedback to climate change and degradation of soil health. While the world soils are under threat, those of the developing countries have severe consequences to food security for the growing and mostly resource-poor population.   The already existent apprehensions with soil resource management amplify with climate change. Accordingly, an effective retort to climate change calls for varying alternatives and improved management of water and soils in addition to novel approaches for the management of pests, their natural predators, and their lifecycles vicissitudes in response to the climates (Scherr and Mcneely, 2008 ). The constant degradation of the soil has been a major challenge in achieving the SDGs because of its direct and indirect relation to them. Several initiatives have been constantly undertaken to address the issues of relevance of soil sciences. For instance, the year 2015 was declared as the “International Year of Soils” or IYS 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and the Food and  Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations was nominated to implement the IYS 2015 in collaboration with the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and Governments of different countries. The Global Soil Partnership developed the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management (VGSSM) after the approval of the reviewed World Soil Charter that was then approved by the FAO of the United Nations and its member countries (Baritz et al., 2018 ). The VGSSM advocates sustainable soil management as a means to achieve SDGs, food security, and climate adaptation/mitigation. The VGSSM further promotes the viable and effective enhancement and maintenance of the ecosystem services that soil provides serving. It is a kind of reference for an extensive range of dedicated stakeholders, including farmers, forest and land managers, pastoralists, academia policymakers, government officials, civil society agricultural advisors, extension services, development partners, and private sector.1  1 See: http://www.fao.org/global-soil-partnership/resources/highlights/detail/en/c/472458/    As mentioned earlier, there are SDGs in the form of SDG 2, 3, 6, 11, 14, and 15 having direct relevance to the soil resources. For instance, food security food safety (SDG 3), (SDGs 2 and 6), urban development (SDG 11), land-based nutrient pollution of the seas (SDG 14), and sustainability of terrestrial ecosystem services (SDG 15) are all dependent on the provisions of the ecosystem services where soil functions and properties play the central role in delivering the promises (Tóth et al., 2018 ). Zambon et al. (2018)  further argue that conserving the soil quality is contemplated as a fundamental target of any environmental conservation approach at several spatial scales, from local to continental. Accordingly, conservation of soil and the management of soil health has been recognized as a pertinent subject in the UN SDGs, subsequently contributing to goals such as “zero hunger,” “no poverty,” “clean water and sanitation,” and “life on land” directly and to majority of the other goals indirectly (Zambon et al., 2018 ). For instance, SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) are indirectly reliant on the accessibility of healthy and strong soil resources (Tóth et al., 2018 ). 17.2.1 SDG 2—“Zero hunger” and soil With the growth in population and consumption, the demand for food worldwide is expected to observe the ongoing increase at least for another 40 years (Godfray et al., 2010 ). As Garnett et al. (2013) , argue, “Demand for food is increasing as populations grow and gain wealth to purchase more varied and resource-intensive diets.” In the policy agenda  globally, food security, thus, is a high priority. For instance, addressing the challenges associated with food security worldwide together with poverty alleviation and climate change necessitates intensifying the mitigation potential and adaptive capability of agricultural landscapes especially across the tropics (Harvey et al., 2014 ). Measures have been undertaken to address the same. Still, there is a long way before finally desired outcomes are achieved. Further, there is a growing competition for water, land, energy, and several other inputs toward food production (Garnett et al., 2013 ). This growing competition along with the overexploitation of fisheries will certainly distress the global competence to produce food (Godfray et al., 2010 ). The twofold aim of SDG 2 is the quest for global agricultural sustainability and food security, which calls for urgent and rigorous action from both the developed and developing countries (Gil et al., 2018 ). As explained by Biesalski and Birner (2018, pp. 57) ,The targets defined under sustainable development goal 2 not only focus on ending all forms of malnutrition – including hidden hunger – but assert that secure and equal access to land is crucial if food and nutrition security are to be assured. In addition, they highlight the need for sustainable food systems, including agricultural practices that help maintain ecosystems and progressively improve land and soil quality.   The larger goal today is not only to merely maximize the productivity but also to enhance the outcomes of an exceedingly intricate landscape of production, social justice, and environment (Godfray et al., 2010 ). For instance, in the pulses cultivating areas, the agronomic advantages of nitrogen fixation in the soils include the potential to offer constructive contributions toward achieving the requirements as sketched in the UN SDGs associated with both climate change and food production (Clark, 2018 ). Nevertheless, mitigation and adaptation activities of the agricultural landscapes are susceptible to be addressed discretely owing to a range of socioeconomic, political, technical, and financial constraints (Harvey et al., 2014 ). The fact that the world will require 70%–100% more food by the year 2050 (Godfray et al., 2010 ) possess a major challenge to already challenged sustainability concerns. Monitoring global food insecurity is a complicated task even under steady economic circumstances, giving rise to a number of controversies and significant limitations (Gustafson, 2013 ). However, one aspect of this insecurity is certain that in this increasingly globalized world, food insecurity in a particular region has the potential to impact the political and economic structure of  another region. Accordingly, preserving soil quality and ensuring adequate agricultural production and distribution remain pertinent irrespective of the level of development in a country.  17.2.2 SDG 3—“Good health and well-being for people” and soil Soil has a substantial consequence on human health, whether those effects are constructive or undesirable, direct or indirect (Steffan et al., 2018 ). The notion that human health is knotted with soil is not new. Authors Brevik and Sauer (2015, pp. 35)  stated:As far back as circa 1400 BC the Bible depicts Moses as understanding that fertile soil was essential to the well-being of his people. In 400 BC the Greek philosopher Hippocrates provided a list of things that should be considered in a proper medical evaluation, including the properties of the local ground. By the late 1700s and early 1800s, American farmers had recognized that soil properties had some connection to human health. In the modern world, we recognize that soils have a distinct influence on human health.   Unfortunately, today, soil pollution is a major challenge faced by the global population. For instance, the rapid economic and social development in China over the last several decades resulted in serious and widespread soil pollution by heavy metals in the country (Li et al., 2014 ). As the global population increases, depletion of soil becomes universal in the form of pollution, landfills, and biofuel production and agricultural usages suffer (D’autilia and D’ambrosi, 2015 ). The authors Li et al. (2014)  further argue that even though heavy metals could naturally occur in soil, added contributions of the same to the soil could be attributed to anthropogenic activities in the form of mining, industrialization, urbanization, and agriculture. Although soil remains a vital source of nutrients in the overall food supply and medicines like antibiotics, the existence of human pathogens with nutrient imbalances in the biological community of soil has the potential for destructive human health repercussions (Steffan et al., 2018 ). Accordingly, food safety and environmental pollution are two major global issues at present with water and soil pollution historically having large impacts on food safety and thus, posing a significant threat to the human health (Lu et al., 2015 ). There are primarily three major ways through which mankind are exposed to the soil materials: (1) respiration, (2) skin penetration or absorption, and (3) ingestion (Steffan et al., 2018 ). For instance, food  crops consumption contaminated by heavy metals is a key route for human exposure through the food chain (Khan et al., 2008 ). As contamination of soil by various chemical compounds and elements in many locations across the globe is a common phenomenon due to the natural and anthropogenic activities, the possibilities of their entrance to the human and animal bodies through the processes of respiration, skin penetration, or ingestion also amplify considerably. Soils affecting the human health comprise both natural soil with insignificant anthropogenic contamination, and also soils in urban areas, agroecosystems, mines, landfill sites, oil and gas withdrawal zones, and several other sites where contamination by anthropogenic activities is more possible (Steffan et al., 2018 ). The soil and water pollution with its destructive impacts on food safety have placed several people at the risk of various ailments including carcinogenic diseases (Lu et al., 2015 ). Even though each and every one of our health is impacted by soil at least to some extent, people who are in professions involving close work with soil such as miners, construction workers, or the farmers are particularly at a larger risk of health issues (Steffan et al., 2018 ). Therefore maintaining soil health is imperative in ensuring the health of the humans.  17.2.3 SDG 6—“Clean water and sanitation” and soil Although the foremost aim of sanitation is to sequester feces of human and stop contact with fecal pathogens, over 2.4 billion people globally are deprived of access to enhanced sanitation facilities and approximately 1 billion people defecate openly (Freeman et al., 2017 ). India is the resident country of one-third of the people worldwide deprived of access to improved sanitation and also of two-thirds of the people involved in open defecation and a quarter of the 1.5 million people who expire every year from diarrheal diseases (Clasen et al., 2014 ). It has been estimated that over 1 billion people worldwide are diseased with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), which are the parasitic worms living in the intestine (gut) of the humans (Strunz et al., 2014 ). The STH infections are a major public health concern particularly in resource-constrained settings worldwide with chronic STH infections damaging the optimal learning and productivity, and thus, subscribing to the continuance of the poverty-disease cycle (Echazú et al., 2015 ). As further described by Strunz et al. (2014, pp. 38) :These intestinal worms, including roundworm, hookworm, and whipworm, mainly occur in tropical and subtropical regions and are most common in developing countries, where personal hygiene is poor, there is insufficient access to clean water, and sanitation (disposal of human feces and urine) is inadequate or  absent. STHs colonize the human intestine and their eggs are shed in feces and enter the soil. STHs leads to a heavy parasite infestation of the gut, causing chronic diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, and abdominal pain. In addition, the parasites compete with their human host for nutrients, leading to malnutrition, anemia, and, in heavily infected children, stunting of physical growth and slowing of mental development.   Ensuring proper sanitation facilities is of utmost importance toward ensuring a world without destructive soil-borne pathogens. The combination of improved hygiene or sanitation and deworming has the potential for larger reductions in the STH infection than any sole interference on its own (Benjamin-Chung et al., 2015 ). As a positive intervention, global strategy on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) as proposed by the World Health Organization for 2015–2020 boosts the integration of both aspects of sanitation and diseases, while upholding the prevailing structured NTD investments and hastening in the direction of the SDG targets (Campbell et al., 2018 ). Subsequently, SDG-allied and WASH–NTD indicators were being developed, beginning a vital intersectoral discourse, in conjunction with prospects for upcoming disease-specific enhancements (Campbell et al., 2018 ).  17.2.4 Soil and SDG 11—“Sustainable cities and communities” Globally, it has been estimated that 30% of the population of the world resided in urban areas in the year 1950, which has increased to 54% in the year 2016 and projected to be 66% by the year 2050 (Lal, Stewart, 2018 ). It is indeed usual to enquire how far the cities can grow with respect to their area and people, while still conserving adequate country to harvest food for the entire world populace (D’autilia and D’ambrosi, 2015 ). For instance, the expansion of the cities has instigated an enlargement of the paved areas, also known as “soil sealing,” which is nothing but the permanent covering of the soil surface by infrastructures, buildings, or any impervious artificial material (Rodríguez-Rojas et al., 2018 ). This kind of practice is a great menace, both in the form of “permanent loss of soil as a resource” besides “the impacts on soil functionality” (Rodríguez-Rojas et al., 2018 ). Food production has the potential to suffer irreversibly from this kind of development as agricultural lands are shrinking worldwide while producing food for the ever-growing world population remains a major challenge. Today, there is a dearth of food  near city areas that have the potential to cause immense social conflicts. For instance, as the local food becomes scarce, the inhabitants are forced toward the importation of food from some other place, with the risk of severe regional conflicts (D’autilia and D’ambrosi, 2015 ). The North America, Europe, and Latin America constitute the most urbanized regions in the world (Lal, Stewart, 2018 ). The quantity of land taken for various kinds of urban development is estimated to be approximately 1000 km2  per year (on a European Union scale) (Rodríguez-Rojas et al., 2018 ). Further describing the urban intrusion of the world and its impacts on soil, Lal, Stewart (2018)  argue:Urban encroachment depletes soil carbon and the aboveground biomass carbon pools, enhancing the flux of carbon from soil and vegetation into the atmosphere. Thus, urbanization has exacerbated ecological and environmental problems. Urban soils are composed of geological material that has been drastically disturbed by anthropogenic activities and compromised their role in the production of food, aesthetics of residential areas, and pollutant dynamics. Properties of urban soils are normally not favorable to plant growth – the soils are contaminated by heavy metals and are compacted and sealed. Therefore, the quality of urban soils must be restored to make use of this valuable resource for delivery of essential ecosystem services (e.g., food, water and air quality, carbon sequestration, temperature moderation, biodiversity).   The deteriorating quality of soil and the presence of foreign materials in it pose a major pollution control challenge. For instance, although polychlorinated biphenyls have never been manufactured in India, still the country, particularly its metropolitan cities, observes high atmospheric and soil deposition of the same primarily due to the informal electronic waste recycling activities (Chakraborty et al., 2016 ). With the ever-increasing serious consequences of “soil sealing” on inhabitants and cities in the form of flooding attributed to the growing volume of stormwater, the increase in temperature of the city atmosphere triggered by a dearth of evapotranspiration from the ground (also known as the “heat island effect”), and the deterioration of waters due to the adulteration of runoff water (Rodríguez-Rojas et al., 2018 ), the presence of heavy metal and persistent organic pollutants further amplify the concerns associated with soil quality and sustainable cities.   17.2.5 Soil and SDG 14—Life below water Development Goal 14 obligates the countries to unite over the “protection of our oceans and the lives that depend on it.”2  2 See: http://in.one.un.org/page/sustainable-development-goals/sdg-14/    The aim is to commit the countries to achieve sustainable management of the marine ecosystems by the year 2020 and considerably decrease the marine pollution of all types. At present, with land-based pollution, the nutrient loading to surface waters worldwide is significant and constantly growing (Glibert et al., 2018 ). The land use within a particular watershed area has significant effects on the water quality of lakes, rivers, estuarine, and coastal waters (Zhou et al., 2016 ). As described by Kroeze et al. (2016, pp. 35) :Surface water pollution is often caused by nutrients, pathogens, plastics and chemicals such as antibiotics, heavy metals and pesticides. These pollutants have different environmental effects. Excess nutrients, for instance, may result in harmful algal blooms and hypoxia both in rivers and in coastal seas. Pathogens in rivers pose a threat to human health. Chemical pollution can have toxic effects. Surface waters often suffer from the combined impact of multiple pollutants.   The coral reef ecosystem is one of the largest suffers from land-based nutrient pollution. The land-based sources of nutrient pollution result in the eutrophication of reef seawater and can amplify the impacts of ocean acidification via nutrient-driven bioerosion (Prouty et al., 2017 ). Major oceans and seas in the world are already affected by intense eutrophication. Eutrophication in the Baltic Sea resulted in the influx of huge loads of nutrients, for instance, is regarded as the gravest ecological concern for the surface waters at present (Kiedrzyńska et al., 2014 ). The conditions arising from the land-based nutrient pollutants have the potential to contribute to the downfall of coastal coral reef ecosystems rather earlier than the present projections based solely on ocean acidification (Prouty et al., 2017 ). Some of the major ocean ecosystems in the world are challenged by the increasing level of land-based nutrient pollution. The Great Barrier Reef ecosystem, one of the most celebrated coral reef systems in the world, has been deteriorated over the decades in spite of the high level of international and national protection. The land-based pollution resulting in the poor water quality, aggravated by extreme weather events, remains to be a key pressure to the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem (Kroon et al., 2016 ). Given the immense contribution of the coral reefs to the world  environment, the current state of the coral reefs ecosystems throughout the world is both unfortunate and worrisome. As further described by Prouty et al. (2017) ,Coral reefs occupy less than 1% of the world’s seafloor yet support hundreds of thousands of animal and plant species, sustain the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people around the world, and protect thousands of kilometers of coastline from coastal hazards. Yet coral reefs are facing increasing stress from global climate change, such as increasing temperatures, sea levels, and ocean acidification (OA), combined with local stressors from overfishing, sedimentation, and land-based sources of pollution including coastal acidification.   Glibert et al. (2018)  have observed that the spatial variances in the forms and amounts of nutrients released to the receiving water bodies are huge, with North America, Western Europe, and Asia exporting the maximum loads of nutrients, particularly in the form of inorganic nitrogen (N). Further, the authors have postulated that the export of N is rising more speedily than that of phosphorus (P) worldwide contributing to “stoichiometrically imbalanced nutrient conditions.” There is a need for enhancing the knowledge and research through international scientific collaborations to holistically address the issues concerning land-based nutrient pollutants.  17.2.6 Soil and SDG 15—Life on land Our fate and future as a species are reliant and linked to the condition of our most vital habitat—land or land ecosystem.3  3 See: http://in.one.un.org/page/sustainable-development-goals/sdg-15/    Soil is a natural, living, dynamic body that is fundamental toward the function of the terrestrial ecosystems (Lehman et al., 2015 ). It is however degraded constantly, the effects of which could be realized most sturdily in the developing countries where the great majority of the population earn their livings directly from soil (Tully et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, concerns associated with soil erosion and overall loss of soil fertility are no longer restricted to the developing nations alone and thus, constitute a major global apprehension today (Khaledian et al., 2017 ). As described by Delong et al. (2015) ,Soil degradation is not isolated to one region, or even one continent; it is a world problem. Eleven percent of the earth’s land surface is occupied by agriculture and 25% is already highly degraded according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. Although  the expressions of soil degradation range from salinization to the overall depletion of organic matter and nutrients, perhaps the two most extensive forms are salinization and erosion.   As SDG 15 illustrates, life on land largely depends on the health and quality of the soil. Enriched biodiversity of the planet and conservation of the same is a very relevant example here. As argued by Wagg et al. (2014) , the loss of biodiversity has developed into a global apprehension and evidence shows that it will destructively disturb the ecosystem services on which the society rests on. The authors further state that “soil biodiversity loss and simplification of soil community composition impair multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity, decomposition, nutrient retention, and nutrient cycling.” Accordingly, conservation of soil and maintaining its health is essential both from the resource preservation and biodiversity perspectives.   17.3 Conclusion Since the year 2000, the MDGs have focused on aspects of sustainable development and ways to achieve the same. In the year 2014, a set of SDGs was proposed by the UN member states for the period between 2015 and 2030 with an aim to succeed the MDGs. Under the purview of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UN adopted the 17 SDGs and 169 associated targets toward attaining sustainable development. “Soil” finds considerable importance in the sustainable development goals, as it is considered as a vital element toward achieving the SDGs. A number of SDGs are directly or indirectly associated with soil. On particular, SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being for people), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (Life below water), and SDG 15 (Life on land) allude to targets that suggest direct reference of soil resources. The majority of the other goals are indirectly linked to the soil. For instance, SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) are indirectly reliant on the accessibility of healthy and strong soil resources. We have further discussed individually aspects of the SDGs directly associated with soil and tried to locate their significances in achieving or denying those particular SDGs. For instance, food production has the potential to suffer irreversibly from development activities such as “soil sealing” in the city areas as agricultural lands are shrinking worldwide while producing food for the ever-growing world population remains a major challenge. Today, there is a dearth of food near city areas that have the potential to cause immense social conflicts. In this increasingly  globalized world, food insecurity in a particular region has the potential to impact the political and economic structure of another region. Accordingly, preserving soil quality and ensuring adequate agricultural production and distribution remain pertinent irrespective of the level of development in a country. Thus ensuring sustainable soil management is probably the most important concern while achieving SDG 2—“Zero hunger” and SDG 11—“Sustainable cities and communities.” Similarly, SDG 14—life below water and SDG 15—Life on land, both are greatly dependent on soil. Conservation of soil and maintaining its health are essential both from the resource preservation and biodiversity perspectives. Unfortunately, some of the major ecosystems in the world are challenged by the deteriorating health of the soil. Today, soil pollution is a major challenge faced by the global population. For instance, the ocean ecosystem is today largely affected by the increasing level of land-based nutrient pollution. The Great Barrier Reef ecosystem, one of the most celebrated coral reef systems in the world, has been deteriorated over the decades in spite of the high level of international and national protection. As contamination of soil by various chemical compounds and elements in many locations across the globe is a common phenomenon due to the natural and anthropogenic activities, the possibilities of their entrance to the human and animal bodies through the processes of respiration, skin penetration or ingestion also amplify considerably. It poses a large challenge to achieve SDG 3—“Good health and well-being for people.” It is essential to undertake strict research and policy initiatives to ensure proper soil health. Most countries are engaged in formulating and implementing serious and thoughtful policy suggestions to attain sustainable development. Accordingly, during the last two decades, “sustainability science” has attracted major research and policy attention as a promising arena of innovation and enquiry. Soil studies should be a priority here as most SDGs are directly or indirectly affected by soil and its quality.   References Baritz et al., 2018 R. Baritz  L. Wiese  I. Verbeke  R.
