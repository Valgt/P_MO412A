               In Malaysia, it was estimated that approximately 250,000 tons of municipal solid garbage were produced every day because of our daily activities. Categorizing these municipal solid trashes efficiently into respective types for recycling purposes has been imminent to minimize their adverse effects on our environment. This chapter presented a solid waste sorting system to distinguish three different types of solid waste by using a deep learning method. The YOLOv3 was proposed as a real-time object identification module to differentiate solid trash. YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-tiny were trained to recognize plastic bottles, paper, and metal with 150 distinct photos. When compared to the YOLOv3-tiny model, the YOLOv3 model produced a notably higher mean average precision (mAP). Due to the greater numbers of the convolutional layer in the latter, the mAP for YOLOv3 was averaging 81.93%, whereas the mAP for YOLOv3 was only 74.58%. Furthermore, the YOLOv3 convergence rate was also substantially faster than that of YOLOv3-tiny. YOLOv3 object detection accuracy for plastic bottles, paper, and metal is 0.98, 1, and 1, respectively, under static conditions. YOLOv3-tiny, on the other hand, was unable to detect plastic bottles, with detection accuracies of just 0.68 and 0.94 for paper and metal cans, respectively. Such attributes feature YOLOv3 as a viable object recognition tool for use in a solid waste sorting system.

Categorizing these municipal solid trashes efficiently into respective types for recycling purposes has been imminent to minimize their adverse effects on our environment. This chapter presented a solid waste sorting system to distinguish three different types of solid waste by using a deep learning method. The YOLOv3 was proposed as a real-time object identification module to differentiate solid trash. YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-tiny were trained to recognize plastic bottles, paper, and metal with 150 distinct photos. When compared to the YOLOv3-tiny model, the YOLOv3 model produced a notably higher mean average precision (mAP). Due to the greater numbers of the convolutional layer in the latter, the mAP for YOLOv3 was averaging 81.93%, whereas the mAP for YOLOv3 was only 74.58%. Furthermore, the YOLOv3 convergence rate was also substantially faster than that of YOLOv3-tiny. YOLOv3 object detection accuracy for plastic bottles, paper, and metal is 0.98, 1, and 1, respectively, under static conditions. YOLOv3-tiny, on the other hand, was unable to detect plastic bottles, with detection accuracies of just 0.68 and 0.94 for paper and metal cans, respectively. Such attributes feature YOLOv3 as a viable object recognition tool for use in a solid waste sorting system.   Keywords Solid waste management  solid waste  deep learning  waste segregation  and convolutional neural network   21.1 Introduction  Solid waste (SW), commonly known as municipal SW (MSW), is causing adverse socioeconomic impacts when not handled appropriately [1,2] . This issue is exacerbated as the global population and urbanization are increasing precipitously, leading to a higher waste production rate [3] . The agricultural, manufacturing industry, and energy production are some of the notable MSW contributors [4] . Electronic waste in the MSW such as a personal computer, phone, television, or washer could potentially cause heavy metal pollution [5] . Fig. 21.1   shows the typical composition of MSW found in Malaysia, breaking down to 45% organic material, 7% paper, 24% plastic, 4% wood, 6% of iron, and others [1] . MSW like paper, plastic, and metal can be recycled and reused [6] . SW management (SWM) system was introduced to assist in handling the MSW generated from every resource of hazardous waste. Fig. 21.2   shows the typical SWM process flow. Initially, the MSWs are gathered from various locations or sources utilizing fixed stations or house-to-house collection and then they are transported by haulage truck to the SWM facility [7,8] . These MSWs are subsequently segregated based on their categories. MSWs that require chemical treatment will be sent to the waste processing stage to reduce their harmful impacts on the environment. Disposal methods including landfill, compositing, and incineration are used at the final stage [5] . In all, collection, transportation, segregation, processing, and disposal of the SWM must all be arranged according to the  right procedures. Any SWM must rigorously follow proper and accurate treatment procedures for SW since improper handling will result in major environmental and societal problems including illness, air pollution, and greenhouse gases [9] . Many techniques have been used for waste segregation, and they can be mainly classified into two categories: direct sorting (Table 21.1  ) and indirect sorting (Table 21.2  ) [10,11] . Direct sorting is a technique that uses the characteristics of SW to separate or identify the required item directly, whereas indirect sorting uses a sensor to find the SW itself. According to research by Gundupalli et al. [10] , spectral imaging-based sorting has a high level of material variety, accuracy, performance, and dependability [12] . Nonetheless, the most common waste segregation method is still manual sorting [1] . It is the most common way of waste segregation but at the same time, it is the least effective way of waste segregation [1] . Furthermore, manual sorting might also bring about negative effects on the segregator, as they might be exposed to hazardous materials [13] .   Combining deep learning or machine learning techniques with image processing can inherently increase the efficiency and accuracy of spectral imaging-based sorting. According to the study by Piotr et al. [14] , accuracy may be increased from 90% to 96.7% by implementing deep learning in classification systems. Deep learning is being used to improve the present trash segregation approach and raise recovery rates, while reducing or replacing the need for human labor in manual segregation. Deep learning is a component of artificial intelligence. It has been advised for use in SVM because it can be trained to accurately distinguish solid trash from a collection of MSW using the image processing approach [15] . Increasing the number of layers inside a deep learning machineâs architecture can enhance speed. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most often used architecture. As shown in Fig. 21.3  , the layers that make up a CNN for feature extraction include the input layer, convolution layer, pooling layer, and fully connected layer for output [16] . A three-dimensional feature map will be produced by splitting the image into two to three layers using the input layer [17] . The matrix will next be processed after going through the pooling layer, which assists in filtering out the lowest value by processing the map using a convolution operation. The size of the map will then be further reduced by a pooling layer. The pooling layer will use the maximum or average pooling algorithms to compute each region on the map. Finally, a feature map will be formed in the final connected layer. By using the output, it can use to compare the data with other images to classify objects on this image. In order to increase its accuracy and capability to recognize various types of SW objects using its own intricate architecture, deep learning may be applied to SVM in the form of object detection. This study  aims to establish a YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-tiny-based SW sorting system. The performance of the SW sorting system when operated under these deep learning schemes will also be evaluated subsequently. This system is expected to advance the use of deep learning methods in SW sorting systems, which in turn minimize the dependence on the human sorting system in a foreseeable future.  21.2 Methods 21.2.1 Conceptual design of a waste segregation machine Fig. 21.4   shows the conceptual design of the SW sorting machine. A conveyor belt, camera, Arduino Uno, and two servo motors with rods are used in the design and construction of this system. When the instruction is given, the servo motor with a rod will direct the SW to the appropriate bin while it is still going ahead. The appropriate bin will be slid over the solid garbage. The solid trash will be transported on a conveyor belt and scanned by a camera to determine if it is made of paper, metal, or plastic. When asked for paper, the first servo will reply, followed by servo 2. Plastic will be found, but it will be disposed of 3. The flowchart of the SW sorting machine operation is shown in Fig. 21.5  , while Fig. 21.6   shows the computer-aided drawing (CAD) for the waste sorting machine prototype.   21.2.2 Comparison of the object detection module Region-based convolution neural networks, like R-CNN, and regression-based convolution neural networks, like YOLO, are two types of object identification that use deep learning [20] . One of the widely used techniques for object detection is R-CNN. The operating idea of this objective detection is based on selective search, and the bounding box was constructed using the regression concept. Fast R-CNN is a development of R-CNN, which is another variant of R-CNN. R-CNN and  Fast R-CNN vary in that the latter uses a more performant network known as a VGG16-based network [21] . The YOLOv3 method, a regression-based convolution neural network, uses CNN to detect objects. After extensive investigation and analysis, YOLOv3 was selected as the object detecting method. YOLOv3 has a greater mean value of average accuracy, mAP, and recall rate when compared to R-CNN. R-CNN has an mAP of 69.7%, whereas YOLOv3 has 76.1%. [22] . When compared to R-CNN and Fast R-CNN, the YOLO also performs faster [20,23] . Another drawback of employing R-CNN is that, because of the time requirements for training, it cannot be used for real-time scanning. In the meanwhile, using the Fast R-CNN is not recommended because its performance will decline over time. The YOLOv3 will be the finest choice in this study as a result of the research. The YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 will not be selected due to the hardware limitations in this study since they required a better version. In comparison to the first version of YOLO, such as YOLOv2, YOLOv3 has greater accuracy and detection speed. As a result, the YOLOv3  approach, which is in charge of object identification and classification in this study, will be the best one to utilize. Fig. 21.7   shows the architecture of YOLOv3. The YOLOv3 has its type of neural network structure and uses the feature extraction network of DarkNet-53 (Fig. 21.8  ) as the backbone for YOLOv3. DarkNet-53 is made up of 53 layers of convolutional layer [24] . The YOLOv3 has a  total of 106 layers with 53 layers from the DarkNet-53, while another 53 layers are for detection purposes [25] . There are 5 different scales of the residual layer which is made up of 3Ã3 and 1Ã1 of the convolutional layer. The image will pass through the residual blocks to reduce the spatial resolution of the image to 1/32 of the input image, and then it will pass to another layer. The upsampling layer is a simple layer that doubles up the dimensions of the input. Two upsampling layers will take different inputs from the DarkNet-53 layer, which are from the third and fourth residual layers. In the end, there will be three different outputs for the detection layer responsible for the detection of the output in the form of feature maps on a different scale, which are 13Ã13, 26Ã26, and 52Ã52, which will pass to the detection layer [26,27] . As a result, three different output layers are y1, y2, and y3 [25,27] . At the end of the process, the output vector can be obtained or returned to the system for classification purposes. The output vector is shown in Eq. (21.1) , where P c   is prediction probability; B x   is x position for the center of the bounding box; B y   is y position for the center of the bounding box; B h   is the height of the bounding box; B w   is the weight of bounding box.; and C n   is class probabilities (n =number of class) [20,29] .(21.1) y = P  c     B  x     B  y     B  h     B  w     C  1     C  2     C  3             If there is an object in the picture, the P c   will be 1, or else it will be maintaining 0. If there is an object in the picture, the bounding box will be formed in the image, video, or real-time video and capture the whole object using the box. The parameter of the bounding box like weight, location, and height will be based on the value of B x  , B y  , B h  , and B w   (Eq. 21.2 ) based on the bounding box prior or anchor box which are the height, P h  , and the width, P w  [20,22,29] . To compute this value, there are some calculations by using the value of coordinates from the YOLOv3 network. The four coordinates are t x  , t y  , t h  , and t w  . The initiate coordinate  in the image is not located in the middle, it falls on the top left corner of the image called C x   and C y   and is divided into SÃS grid cells.(21.2) B x  = Ï t x   + C x    B y  = Ï t y   + C y    B w  = p w  e t w      B h  = p h  e t h          The anchor box (Fig. 21.9  ) also plays an important role in the YOLOv3. It is used to detect the target depending on the k-mean. The anchor box is used to prepredict the object in the picture and predict multiple objects in the image if there is an object in the image. It will also help to identify two overlapping objects without considering them as one object. It will return the value as Pw and Pw. There will be three anchor boxes used during the detection and classification phase to target the object using a different scale: (10Ã13), (16Ã30), (33Ã23), (30Ã61), (62Ã45), (59Ã119), (116Ã90), (156Ã198), and (373Ã326) [22,30] . In general, the anchor box will be applied or appear on the image during the training process based on the value of intersection over union (IoU). IoU is an evaluation method in object detection, which is used for measuring accuracy. It will compare the value of the anchor box and ground truth box, which is the box where the image will fall in. The  higher the value of IoU, the greater the accuracy. The mathematical formula of IoU is shown in Eq. 21.3 .(21.3) IoU = A  a   â© B  t    A  a   âª B  t        where A a   is the area of the anchor box, while B t   is the area of the truth box. This equation is used to calculate the IoU (Fig. 21.10  ) [29,33,34] . If the object inside the anchor box is less than 0.5, then the anchor box will not take it as an object and no object will be detected and classified [29,33,34] .  21.2.3 Training YOLOv3 In this study, the data set will be prepared to train the YOLOv3 to classify the SW based on its type, which is plastic, metal, and paper. At the end of the training using the program Google Colab, the program will generate the WEIGHTS file and CFG file for this SVM. These files will then transfer to the program for running the object detection. There will have three sets of data of plastic, paper, and metal. Each set will contain 150 images for training purposes. Each image will be processed using software,  âlabellmg,â to label each object in the picture and then generate a txt file (Fig. 21.11  ). This âtxtâ file will have the same name as the image fileâs name, and it will contain the data for each object in the picture. It will contain the number of classes, the location of the class, and the size of the bounding box for that object. There will be five numbers in a row (Fig. 21.12  ). The number beginning with 0 or 1 will be the class number. In this case, the number 0 will be plastic, 1 will be metal, and 2 will be paper. The second (green) and third (red) numbers will be the x and y coordination. The last two numbers will be the width (yellow) and height (brown) of the bounding box. After labeling for all images, those sets will be combined and compressed into a zip file to upload to google drive. Due to the limitation of hardware, the training program and evaluation will be conducted using an online GPU, Google Colab to run the training process by using the DarkNet-53. Google Colab, also known as Google Colaboratory, allows for programming and executing the Python program in the browser for  12 hours. At the beginning of the program, it will access Google Drive and download the image zip file. Then the Darknet-53 will be downloaded to the Google Colab. The Google Colab will start to train using the image file and their txt file for training purposes. At the end of the training section in the Google Colab, there will have two files being generated, which are the CFG file and the WEIGHTS file for transfer learning purposes. The CFG file is the layout of the YOLOv3. In this case, the YOLOv3 will be modified as three classes need to be detected so the layout has been modified. To check whether the trained model is accurate, these two things will be evaluated, which are the mean average precision, mAP, precision, recall, and loss. These data will be the judge for the performance of the YOLOv3 training phase. The precision is showing that the ratio of the number of objects detected is correct, which can be expressed as Eq. 21.4 , where N TP   is the number of truth positives (number of objects detected correctly) and N FP  is the number of false positives (number of objects detected wrongly) [29,35,36] .(21.4) Precision = N  TP    N  TP   + N  FP         The recall rate  indicates the rate of predicting an object wrongly. If the rate is small, the object detection model is predicted correctly to all data [29,35,36] . The recall rate  is expressed by Eq. 21.5 , where N FN   is the number of false negatives (number of ground truth objects not detected) [29,33,36] .(21.5) Recall = N  TP    N  TP   + N  FN         The mAP stands for the object in the images that are detected correctly. It is the mean value based on the calculation of average precision for all classes. The average precision (AP) can be obtained using the curve of precision recall by calculating the area under the curve. Then the value will be passed to another formula to calculate the mAP, which is expressed by Eq. 21.6 , where n is the number of classes [29,33] .(21.6) mAP = 1  n   Ã â i = 1  N   A P  i        The loss value is given at last. There are three types of loss which are classification loss (Eq. 21.7 ), localization loss (Eq. 21.8 ), and confidence loss (Eq. 21.9 ). If the YOLO performs unsatisfactorily, like if the  prediction is often wrong, the loss value will be higher. If the YOLO always predicts the object correctly, the loss value will be very small. The ideal loss value is lesser than 1 to ensure that the YOLOv3 model performs effectively and correctly. The localization loss is the error of the prediction box and the ground truth object in which the prediction box is offset from the actual object [29,30,37] . The confidence loss is the error of objectness of the box, which supposes that there is an object in the box, but the system did not detect so it will consider as confidence loss [29,30,37] . The last loss will be the classification loss, which is the error occurring when misclassification happens [29,30,37] . All types of loss added together will become the total loss, as shown in Eq. 21.10 .(21.7) Classification Loss = â i = 0  s  2     â c â classes   [ p  i   c    â   p  Ë   i   c    ]  2      where c  is the specified class, p  Ë   i     is true value probability for the classes, and p  i     is predicted value probability for the classes [23,29,30,37] .(21.8) Localization = Î»  coord   â i = 0  s  2    â j = 0  NB   l  i j  obj   [ ( x  i   â x Ë   i    )   2  + ( y  i   â y Ë   i    )   2   ]    + Î»  coord   â i = 0  s  2    â j = 0  NB   l  i j  obj   [ ( w  i     â w Ë   i     )  2  + ( h  i     â h Ë   i     )  2   ]        where x  Ë   i   , y  Ë   i   , w  Ë   i   , h  Ë   i     is coordination, width, and height of bounding box, x  i   , y  i   , w  i   , h  i     is the truth value of the bounding box, and Î»  coord     is coordinate error weight, S  is the number of grids, and NB  is the number of bounding boxes [23,29,30,37] .(21.9) Confidence Loss = â i = 0  s  2     â j = 0  B   l  ij  obj   ( c  i   â c  Ë   i   )  2     + Î»  noobj   â i = 0  s  2     â j = 0  B   l  ij  obj   ( c  i   â c  Ë   i   )  2        where Î»  noob     is IoU error weight, c  Ë   i     is truth confidence value, and c  i     is predict confidence value [23,29,30,37] .(21.10) Total Loss = Localization Loss + Confidence Loss + Classification Loss     At the end of the training of YOLOv3, the loss and mAP graph will be evaluated, and the result will be compared with YOLOv3-tiny with  the same dataset but different configuration to see which model is better before being transferred to the computer to ensure that the model is able to get trained well and able to perform effectively. Those two files generated from the training will be transferred to the computer to run the file for object detection.   21.3 Results and discussions The focus of this section is to evaluate the accuracy of the object detection model during the training process. This is essential to ensure that the system is capable of carrying out its duty. The loss and map graph will be examined comprehensively. This section will focus on training the YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-tiny and examining their performances. The variables that affect the mAP, recall, and loss during object detection will be investigated. Google Colab with inherently limited runtime will be utilized to perform the training process. A total of 450 images will be used for the training due to the limitation of Google Colab. During the training process, 80% of the image will be used for training, while 20% of the image will be used to validate whether the trained model can detect the object inside the image. The total number of images is restricted to 450 due to the total number of images for training and testing purposes cannot be more than 500 in Google Colab. 21.3.1 Evaluation of Training The model will detect the object inside the image and then export the class, location, and the bounding box of the object; then these data will be used to compare with the data file that already consists of the data of that image and then come out with the precision, F1-score, recall rate, true positive, false positive, false negative, an average of IoU, and mAP. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, the formula of which is given by Eq. 21.11 [38] .(21.11) F 1 â score = 2 Ã Precision Ã Recall  Recall Ã Precision       The F1-score is also a parameter to judge the model and whether the model is accurate or not. The value of F1-score is between zero and one. If the value is 1, then the model has high accuracy, while if the value is 0, then it means the model is not accurate enough to detect an object. During this training, the mAP of 50% will be used as a minimum score  for the evaluation, which means if the object detected inside the image has more confidence, more than 50% or 0.5 will be taken as true and the result of the training model will be compared with the actual answer. The table given above is the result of each 1000 iteration, which means the number of times it is trained. A highly accurate model will have high F1-score, TP, IoU, and mAP, while low in FP and FN. TP will indicate the object is detected by the model and is correct to the ground truth, while FP means the object detects the object in the image, but there is no object inside the bounding box [29,35,36] . FN means object exists in the image but the model is unable to detect the object. Table 21.3   shows that the parameter from YOLOv3 is usually higher than the result of YOLOv3-tiny. This can be explained by the convolutional layer being different compared to YOLOv3 with YOLOv3-tiny. YOLOv3-tiny has a lesser convolutional layer compared to the YOLOv3. The convolutional layer helps to filter out the input image and detect the presence of an object in the image if the filter is less, which means that it is unable to detect the object inside the image accurately. Although both models are using the same darkent53. conv.74 to train the dataset, their configuration file is still different compared to others. The cfg file of the model contains the structure of the model. YOLOv3 has a structure of darknet 53, while the YOLOv3-tiny just has seven basic convolutional layers and some 1Ã1 and 3Ã3 convolutional layers [39] . Their algorithm of YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-tiny are different, which leads to the rest of the results in the table given above being different from each other. Based on Table 21.3 , it can be seen that YOLOv3 has higher accuracy with respect to the F1-score, mAP and IoU are more than YOLOv3-tiny, while YOLOv3 has just 0.01 accuracy. The YOLOv3-tiny cannot detect the object in the test image with just training 1000 iterations as it returns the result of 292 in FN. After training 2000 iteration, both models are more accurate compared to the models that just trained 1000. This shows that the number of iterations will affect the parameter. This does not much affect the YOLOv3 model, as it has an mAP of more than 80% on the 2000 iteration. Comparing YOLOv3 to YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv3âs result showed that it is more accurate than the YOLOv3-tiny based on F1-score, TP, FP, FN, IoU, and mAP. YOLOv3 has 81.93% of mAP, which is more than 74.58% of mAP of YOLOv3-tiny. YOLOv3 also has 0.83 of F1-score, while F1-score of YOLOv3-tiny is just 0.75. It can be concluded that YOLOv3 has more accuracy compared to YOLOv3-tiny, and the more convolutional layer of the model, the more accurate is the model.    21.3.2 Training results for classes In this subsection, the results for the accuracy of models when detecting the object in each class are shown. This result assesses whether the model can classify the object correctly or not. Table 21.4   shows the result for  each training result for each class after 1000 iterations of training. Based on the result mentioned above, it can be seen that YOLOv3 has much more accuracy for each class compared to the YOLOv3-tiny based on the AP, TP, and FP. Using the last result of training at 6000 iterations, YOLOv3 has an AP of 90.78% in plastic class, 74.72% in paper class, while 80.31% in metal class, compared to YOLOv3-tinyâs AP results in plastic, paper, and metal class, which are 83.99%, 68.95%, and 70.80%, respectively. It is clearly shown that YOLOv3 has more AP in these three different classes. The TP in the last training of each class of YOLOv3 also is much higher compared to that of YOLOv3-tiny, while YOLOv3 has much lesser FP in plastic and metal. As the result showed again, YOLOv3 has much higher accuracy in classification ability, which is going to implement in object detection to separate the SW based on the type.  21.3.3 Training loss result To determine if object detection is highly accurate or stop the training of the object detection model, one of the methods is to observe the loss during training. As mentioned above, the loss is a type of error in the object detection model, which indicates that the object detection model is unable to detect, locate, and classify the object in the image [29,30,37] . The higher loss means the model is unable to perform well, while the lower loss means the object detection model can detect, locate, and classify the object in the image. In this section, the loss graph of two models will be generated and loss in each 1000 training has been recorded to compare the reason. Based on Figs. 21.13 and 21.14   , it is shown that the loss curve of YOLOv3 converges faster than the YOLOv3-tiny, although the YOLOv3 has more loss in the beginning, which is 2116.475098, while the loss of YOLOv3-tiny in the beginning is just 678.747498. From the graph and Table 21.5  , the YOLOv3âs loss drops much faster than the YOLOv3-tiny, as both learning rates are the same. This showed that the YOLOv3 can train much faster than YOLOv3-tiny to achieve much higher accuracy, even though both starting losses are different. The result also showed that the convolutional layer of YOLOv3 helped the model to get a much lower low at 1000 iterations, while YOLOv3-tiny loss is higher than the loss of YOLOv3 at 1000 iterations. This showed that YOLOv3 is much more suitable to use to train a large dataset and has better accuracy with lesser iterations, while Yolv3-tiny is not. As the training   continues, the loss of both models keeps decreasing, and so the loss of YOLOv3 will be 0.123053, while YOLOv3-tiny is 0.964706, which means YOLOv3 is much more accurate compared to YOLOv3-tiny. Based on the result, YOLOv3âs training is much more effective than the training of YOLOv3-tiny, as YOLOv3 will just need to train 1000 to get 0.863667, while YOLOv3-tiny required more iteration like the result of 6000 iteration to get 0.964706. Figs. 21.15 and 21.16    show the loss and mAP relationship. As the loss value keeps decreasing, the mAP will also increase. It is clearly shown in Figs. 21.15 and 21.16  that the YOLOv3 model converges faster in mAP and loss curves, while YOLOv3-tiny does not. The mAP curve is plotted to start from 1000 iterations and after every 100 iterations will be calculated again and plotted in the graph. The mAP of YOLOv3-tiny is highly unstable, as it drops rapidly and raises rapidly, which indicates that the model required more training to be stable. Once the YOLOv3-tiny model reaches 4800 iterations, the curve will start to be stable and the mAP value will be around 77%. As a result, YOLOv3 is hypothesized to be more accurate than YOLOv3-tiny.  21.3.4 Testing image and prototype After getting the result from the training, the testing will further proceed to test the models with the image to determine whether the model can detect and perform well before being applied to the hardware. The objective of this testing is to find out whether the trained models can detect the object that has been trained in the training to classify the object based  on their type which is to achieve one of the objectives of this paper. As the result, the performance will be compared and evaluated. In this test, the image of plastic, paper, and metal will be used as samples for testing. As shown in Figs. 21.17 and 21.18   , YOLOv3 can detect that there are three different plastic bottles and can locate them, along with classifying the object, while the YOLOv3-tiny is unable to detect those plastic bottles. Although YOLOv3-tiny can detect the paper and metal can in the picture, YOLOv3 can locate them more accurately and its confidence score is much higher than that of YOLOv3-tiny. As a result, YOLOv3 is much more accurate compared to YOLOv3-tiny. Likewise for the paper (Figs. 21.19 and 21.20   ) and metal can testing (Figs. 21.21 and 21.22   ), YOLOv3 has outperformed YOLOv3-tiny in terms of accuracy. This   model is then transferred to the waste sorting machine. As shown in Fig. 21.23  , the YOLOv3 can recognize the metal can, despite with lower accuracy than in static conditions.      21.4 Conclusion This paper examines the use of YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-tiny for an SVM system that can replace the current issue of waste segregation by manual picking and resource recovery to reduce the waste of materials that can reuse or remake for another item. The deep learning method was used to train the system using images of three categories SWs (plastic, paper, and metal). The YOLOv3 model has a higher mAP value compared to the YOLOv3-tiny, as the YOLOv3 has an mAP of 81.93%, while YOLOv3-tiny has an mAP of only 74.58%, because YOLOv3 has more convolutional layers compared to YOLOv3-tiny. This showed that YOLOv3 is more accurate compared to YOLOv3-tiny. The training of YOLOv3 is also faster than YOLOv3-tiny as if the YOLOv3-tiny needs to catch up with the mAP of YOLOv3. As a result, YOLOv3 can be trained with the images and can achieve an accuracy of up to 81.93%. After the complete training of YOLOv3, it can perform object detection for plastic, paper, and metal; the accuracy for each class will be 90.78%, 74.71%, and 80.31%. When applying the YOLOv3 to the waste sorting machine, it can also detect SW on a moving conveyor belt accurately, although the accuracy is notably lower than at static conditions. As for the future works, the ability of the object recognition system should be enhanced to recognize more classes. Furthermore, the ability to sort a large number of wastes at the same time should also be incorporated.   References [1] O.C. Aja  H.H.
