                  The national governments have committed to various sustainable development goals (SDGs); however, actions have to be taken by the local administrations at the city level. In this paper, the city administrations' understanding and preparedness for implementing specific activities related to SDG targets 3.6, 3.9, and 11.2 are discussed. The results of how local communities can participate in prioritizing the implementation of SDG targets at the city level are also presented. Three small cities in India, namely Bulandshahr, Patiala, and Nainital, were monitored for three years. The research team worked closely with the local administrations and local citizens. This paper presents an analysis of the various activities undertaken by the research team and concludes that SDGs can be used as tools for providing ready targets to the authorities, bringing them to a common working ground. The SDG implementation in India follows the top–down approach; however, to achieve the SDG targets, the bottom–up approach should be followed. SDGs are not a priority for several city governments. Cities need encouragement and national support to adopt and implement these SDGs. We have to think of how SDGs can be used to influence day-to-day decisions. SDGs can also be a part of the outcome-based budget of municipalities to prioritize the implementation of SDG-oriented urban infrastructure and plans.

Table 3   Data type Observations   Road network The proportion of national highways passing through the case cities is approximately 30% of the total road network. This is much higher than in larger cities.  Travel patterns In small cities, the proportions of pedestrian trips, short trips (< 1 km), and f females using bicycles are higher compared to those in big cities.  Traffic crash pattern The traffic crash patterns in small cities have some similarities with those in big cities. The proportion of pedestrian, bicycle, and motorcycle victims is nearly 75% of the total fatalities. The large numbers of fatal crashes are on highway segments passing through small cities.  Air quality monitoring The air quality monitoring is weak in small cities. The state pollution control board has one monitoring station each in Bulandshahr and Patiala. The data from these monitoring stations show very poor air quality in both cities. Measures implemented in large cities (fuel restriction, restriction on movement of heavy vehicles, restriction on vehicle age, etc.) are not applicable in small cities.

No specific feedback provided on the draft document. Willingness to experiment with few designs.  Onsite experiment To modify designs as per site requirement. To demonstrate the efficacy of modified designs. The Patiala experiment was abandoned after 20 h. Traffic police was not willing to accept motorized vehicle queues, even if they improved the pedestrians' safety and reduced conflicts. The Bulandshahr experiment lasted longer. The district magistrate committed specific funds to complete the street improvement; however, it was postponed owing to completion of other infrastructure improvement works.  Public exhibition To initiate SDG discussion among all citizens and create the need for a safe and accessible city environment (SDG target 11.2). The concept of SDGs is a relatively new concept for the city authorities as well as the citizens. No visible impact on administration plans in the short term.

Keywords Urban SDG targets  Mobility  Urban governance  Localizing SDGs  Indian cities    1 Introduction The United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the universal, integrated, and transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on September 25, 2015, along with a set of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets. Sustainable transport has been included in seven of the 17 goals and is covered directly by five targets and indirectly by seven targets. These are: 1) Target 3.6 requires halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020; 2) Target 3.9 requires substantially reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination by 2030; 3) Target 7.3 requires doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030; 4) Target 9.1 requires developing quality, reliable, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all; 5) Target 11.2 requires providing access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities, and older persons by 2030; 6) Target 11.6 requires reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management by 2030; and 7) Target 12.c requires rationalizing inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances. This includes restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, considering the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities.1  1 https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/Global%20Indicator%20Framework%20after%202020%20review_Eng.pdf    Since 2015, several researchers have critiqued and highlighted the shortcomings of these targets and indicators [1–3 ]. The critique includes inadequacy of indicators to capture the specific local context, non-availability of data, focus on outcomes and insufficient focus on processes involved to meet the SDGs. However, the SDG targets remain important and relevant because they are based on international consensus and do provide useful guidance to decision makers. Several countries have committed to monitoring SDGs using suggested targets and indicators. 1.1 National commitments The government of India is committed to achieving the 17 SDGs. At the central government level, the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog)2  2 The NITI Aayog is a policy think tank of the Government of India, established with the aim to achieve sustainable development goals with cooperative federalism by fostering the involvement of State Governments of India in the economic policy-making process using a bottom-up approach.www.niti.gov.in    has been assigned the role of overseeing the implementation of SDGs in the country. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is accountable for the development of baseline data on the National Indicator Framework. NITI Aayog works closely with MoSPI, all central ministries, state/union territory (UT)3  3 A union territory is a type of administrative division in the Republic of India. Unlike the states of India, which have their own governments, union territories are federal territories governed, in part or in whole, by the Central Government of India.   governments, international development organizations such as the UN, think tanks, and the civil society organizations for ensuring the adoption, implementation, and monitoring of the SDG agenda.4  4 https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/SDG-India-Index-2.0_27-Dec.pdf    Since 2017, NITI Aayog has been holding state level consultations because the role of states has been recognized as the key to the success of the SDG agenda. Biannually, NITI Aayog has been hosting discussions with all states/UTs. Additionally, 24 stakeholder consultations have been conducted thus far in different parts of the country involving the state/UT governments and other key actors for brainstorming on SDGs. The states/UTs have put in place institutional structures to advance the SDG agenda. Most of the states/UTs have designated their planning department as the nodal agency for coordinating SDG efforts. Some states/UTs have created dedicated cells/units within or outside of their planning department to be responsible for the SDGs. A few states/UTs have designated officers in each government department responsible for coordinating SDG-related activities at the department level.5  5 https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/SDG-India-Index-2.0_27-Dec.pdf    District-level structures have been put in place by some states/UTs. Review mechanisms under senior leadership (chief minister or chief secretary) are operational to monitor progress. NITI Aayog has been supporting the states/UTs in putting in place monitoring mechanisms at their levels and at district levels. Most states/UTs have mapped their government's schemes, programs, and policies with the SDG targets, thereby assigning the responsibility of targets to their respective departments. MoSPI has issued guidelines to all states/UTs to draft their own State Indicator Framework to monitor progress at the state level. The states are also being encouraged to develop their District Indicator Framework and District Index to rank the performance of their districts and trigger a healthy competition. Moreover, they are advised to develop online dashboards to democratize the information on progress and challenges. NITI Aayog also launched SDG India Index 1 in 2018 followed by version 2 in 2019. The objective was to rank the performance of states/UTs based on their achievements across the SDGs. For every goal, all states/UTs were ranked. A composite score was also calculated, which ranked the states/UTs based on their overall performance across the multiple goals. Thus far, the efforts to localize the SDGs have been at the state level, and there has been no effort to localize them at the city level. While policies are set at the state level, the implementation of several targets have to be at the city level. This is particularly true for SDG target 11 and associated targets, which will be discussed in the next section.  1.2 Local (city) commitments In this study, we looked at localizing mobility-related SDG targets, i.e., 3.6, 11.2, 11.6 and 3.9, at the city level. The SDG monitoring mechanism set by NITI Aayog has not addressed the mobility-related SDGs. Both SDG targets 3.6 and 3.9 mentioned in the NITI Aayog report [4 ]. Similarly, while SDG 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, the NITI Aayog report [4 ] states that “five national-level indicators have been identified to measure India's performance toward sustainable cities and communities, which capture two out of the ten SDG targets for 2030 outlined under this goal. These indicators have been selected based on the availability of data at the sub-national level to ensure comparability across states and UTs.” Target 11.2 has missed this aspect. SDG target 11.2 deals with urban areas; however, SDG targets 3.6 and 3.9 are closely related. Target 3.6 can be met by making urban areas accessible and safe particularly for pedestrians. In addition, by providing accessibility to public transport, we can achieve SDG target 3.9 because a higher share of public transport mode would result in reduced dependence on private motorized modes resulting in fuel savings and reduction in air pollution. SDG target 11.2 is in fact the key to achieving SDG targets 3.6 and 3.9. Therefore, this study focused on activities related to these three SDG targets. We implemented an intensive interaction process between 2016 and 2019 with all stakeholders in three small cities in India, namely Bulandshahr, Patiala, and Nainital. The interaction included more than 30 meetings with local stakeholders and 7 workshops. The focus was to evaluate the understanding and preparedness of city administrations for implementing specific activities related to SDG targets 3.6, 3.9, and 11.2. The three small cities were monitored for three years. The research team worked closely with the local administrations and local citizens. The study results were summarized to answer the following three questions:• Are SDG targets a priority of local administrations?  • Can community engagement expedite implementation of SDG compliant policies and investment?  • What lessons can be learned from the action research strategy?      2 Material and methods 2.1 Selection of case study cities The three small size cities were selected for understanding the process of localizing the mobility SDGs. There are 468 cities in India having populations of more than 0.1 million [5 ]. These urban agglomerations and cities are classified into four categories, i.e., small, medium, large, and mega cities. Nearly 30% of the population lives in small 372 cities; therefore, analysis of travel patterns and safety issues in these cities will have scope of replicability and scalability in the future (Table 1  ). Small cities often have poor databases. National level reports on traffic deaths includes data for cities with 1 million population and above [6 ]. City roads and public places are planned by city municipalities and the public works department in India. Most municipalities lack an adequate number of skilled manpower to plan and implement state-of-the-art street designs to ensure a safe and secure urban environment. The current master plan document also does not include discussion of sustainable mobility vision. While the scale of a city may significantly contribute to its set of urban transportation and traffic safety problems, an overall vision of sustainability can be applied to all of them. This is because a truly sustainable urban transport system (irrespective of the city size) gives topmost priority to the mobility and accessibility of all urban residents in a safe and environment-friendly mode of transport. The key features of the case study cities are summarized in Table 2  . All three are small cities (population of less than 500,000); however, they differ in densities and land-use patterns(Table 2 ). Bulandshahr has the highest density among the three case cities, has mixed landuse pattern. Bulandshahr is closes to Delhi and close to industrial belt of Delhi. Nainital is a small hill city where tourist population(transient population) is much higher than the number of local residents. Patiala is comparatively a richer city, medium level density and surrounded by green fields and new industrial area. The governance structure of the three cities is similar in several aspects, with only minor differences. The governance responsibility is with the civil servants mostly appointed at the state level for a period of three years. However, they can be transferred by the higher authorities for various reasons. In two of the three cities we worked in, within three years, we dealt with four district magistrates (one of the highest-ranking administration officers in a district), who sometimes had a short tenure of only six months.  2.2 Method The study was conducted in three phases. 2.2.1 Phase I: database creation In this phase, base data for monitoring selected SDG targets were consolidated from various sources. Traffic safety related information was collected from the First Information Reports of traffic crashes for three years from the local police stations. The travel mode proportions of work trips were available from the 2011 census, and the speed on different corridors was estimated using google API. Administrative maps and road networks were obtained from the local planning department and digitized for further analysis. Air pollution data were obtained from the State Pollution Control Board Office in each city. A stakeholder survey was also conducted on a select group of stakeholders to document their perceptions of mobility issues, specifically with respect to traffic safety, congestion, and air pollution. Phase I concluded in a workshop with all stakeholders, including city administrators, local civil society representatives, students, and local academicians. The findings of phase I were shared and discussed to plan the second phase.  2.2.2 Phase II: demonstration of possible transport infrastructure improvement In Phase II, the focus was on demonstrating how safe and inclusive streets can be designed. In this phase, air pollution monitoring was conducted with the help of locally installed sensors to understand the difference in air pollution levels in areas with heavy traffic movement versus low-density areas in the city. A pilot corridor was selected in consultation with the city administration and detailed plans were prepared for junction improvement and street design using universal design principles. Traffic safety data were used to identify hazardous locations, and road safety inspections were conducted to suggest modifications to road designs for improving safety. The city administration was expected to implement the changes recommended for creating a model street corridor that can ensure safe access to all road users, specifically pedestrians who constitute the largest proportion of commuters and have a very high proportion in fatal traffic crashes. Phase II was concluded by holding a public exhibition over a period of six weeks in each city, highlighting the possibilities of creating safe inclusive streets and inviting public comments on SDG targets.  2.2.3 Phase III: roadmap for achieving specific SDG targets The Phase III activities included preparation of a roadmap for achieving SDG targets 3.6 and 11.2 in two case study cities. Alternate scenarios were suggested for creating infrastructure for non-motorized transport (walking and bicycling) and public transport system. This phase also included field experiments on modifying existing road designs with the help of temporary structures such as bollards and road markings. The field modifications were conducted by a team of the engineers in the city to demonstrate the process of modifying road designs on the ground and fine-tuning designs based on field observations. Phase III concluded in a national workshop, where a public exhibition showing the results of all three phases in our case cities was held. The national workshop had participants from 10 other small cities. The process of localizing the mobility SDGs was discussed by an invited expert panel, specifically with respect to opportunities and barriers in implementing SDGs in small cities. Fig. 1   shows the linkages between different activities conducted in each phase with specific SDG targets. Activities for target 11.6 overlaps with Target 3.6, 11.2 and 3.9. Target 11.6 requires reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality. Since 11.2 results in higher share of PT users and 3.6 ensures safer infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists, both result in reducing negative impact to air quality. Target 3.9 measures this impact. Fig. 1  does not mention target 11.6 separately.    3 Calculations and results Phase I included a compilation of a relevant database concerning the monitoring of SDG targets and surveying various stakeholders to understand their perception of traffic problems. Table 3   summarizes the key observations from secondary data collected for the study. Fig. 2   summarizes the results of the stakeholder perception survey, which was conducted to ascertain the perceptions of stakeholders regarding key traffic and mobility issues and SDG targets. The survey questionnaire was explained in the stakeholder workshop in Bulandshahr and Patiala and the participants were requested to fill the questionnaire. Workshop participants included representatives of city administration, academics, civil society groups and traffic police. About 30 responses were received in each city. In Nainital, specific officials were approached to record their responses. About 20 responses were received in Nainital. The lack of pedestrian facilities and public transport is not perceived to be an important mobility issue, though organized public transport does not exist in these cities and pedestrian infrastructure is very poor, exposing pedestrians to high risk from traffic crashes. Car ownership is very low; however, the lack of parking is perceived to be an important issue. The fault of pedestrians and overspeeding vehicles are perceived to contribute to traffic crashes in both cities, whereas in Patiala, the fault of drivers and bad road designs are also considered important. Thirty percent of the responders did not know that motorized vehicles contribute to air pollution. Similar responses were reported in Nainital. Phase II: The city administration was expected to implement the changes suggested for creating a model street corridor that can ensure safe access to all road users, specifically pedestrians who constitute the largest proportion of commuters and have a very high percentage in fatal traffic crashes. On site experiment was conducted in each of the case study cities with the help of temporary barricades and marking. The purpose of those experiments was to demonstrate the effectiveness of design modifications. Phase II was concluded by holding a public exhibition over a period of six weeks in each city, highlighting the possibilities of creating safe inclusive streets and inviting public comments on SDG targets. Table 4   summarizes the outcomes of these activities. In Phase III, the focus was on preparing roadmaps for achieving the SDG targets in Patiala and Bulandshahr on road safety (SDG target 3.6) and public transport access (SDG target 11.2) and on mapping out the institutions that are responsible for implementing various activities to achieve these targets. Table 5   summarizes the outcome of all activities.  4 Discussion In this section, we present a discussion of implementing specific mobility SDG targets in small cities. 4.1 Road traffic crashes in small cities (SDG target 3.6) The main research question in the project was, “How can we reduce road traffic fatalities and injuries on the road by 2030 with new technologies, better street designs, and enforcement strategies?” Road safety is not a straightforward issue and it is a part of a young science where most of the work has been done after 1960. The collected data of road fatalities in the case cities showed that the motorized two-wheeler users, pedestrians, and bicyclists are the most vulnerable road users in small cities. National policies and programs are still inclined toward making cars safer. The majority of fatal crashes occur at the highways passing through or near the small cities. The average speeds found in these cities were high, primarily because of wide roads and the need to be controlled by design measures. The roadmap for achieving target 3.6 showed that the required interventions have to be implemented by different levels of government and different authorities. All vehicle-related interventions have to be done at the national level. However, city authorities can play a crucial role in achieving target 3.6 since all speed regulating measures and road designs are the responsibility of the city engineers and the public works department. The maximum impact in fatality reduction comes from the improvement in road infrastructure. The scenario analysis showed the following:• In a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, more than 40% of increase in fatalities was found.  • If vehicle technologies are introduced in the fleet in the BAU scenario, approximately 20% reduction in fatalities can be achieved.  • If enforcement is improved in the BAU scenario, another 20% decrease in road fatalities can be obtained.  • Most importantly, there is a 40% decrease in road fatalities when there is a change in road designs.    Combining all the above interventions, we can achieve approximately 50% reduction in road fatalities based on the current rate by 2030.  4.2 Role of public transportation in small cities (SDG target 11.2) The main research question in the project was “How can small cities develop a public transportation system with enough coverage to meet the increased travel demands by 2030?” In the absence of proper institutions, there is no planning for public transport in small cities. The SDG indicators mention the convenient access to public transportation for all in 2030. This can be very well articulated in the current master plans, which are the only planning documents for small cities. Small cities in India are mostly dependent on paratransit or intermediate public transport (IPT) systems such as auto rickshaws or e-rickshaws. The IPT systems themselves reflect the demand for transport service in these cities, and thus, they are documented. The small cities in India have a very high proportion of non-motorized transport trips and short trip lengths. Thus, bus systems integrated with IPT become a feasible option for them. Route planning and fleet estimation can be based on secondary data available from census and local documents. A simple process can be adopted for planning of future public transport in project cities. If planned properly, these systems can cover 80% of the city area, considering a buffer area of 0.5 km on both sides of the proposed routes. The planning includes route selection, modal shift scenarios, fleet requirements, and type of bus fleet. The key challenges of introducing public transportation in small cities include finance arrangements for introducing public transport and related infrastructure development, and institutional structure for operating public transport systems.  4.3 Localization of street design guidelines The main research question was “Can a localized version of street design guidelines help the city in improving the street infrastructure and promote safety?” SDG-oriented street design guidelines were prepared for two project cities, namely Patiala and Bulandshahr. International standards and codes, along with the Indian Road Congress (IRC) codes, were referred. The IRC has a set of 19 guidelines for Indian road engineers, to be used before developing streets. The revision of IRC codes to include new research findings is a very slow process. Moreover, following the IRC codes is not mandated unless it is part of the contract document. A draft street design guideline was submitted to the local authorities in 2019. After review and consultation, the guideline was split into two components: planning and design. These were prepared based on the role of different agencies in a city. The planning of streets is done by development authorities and the implementation rests with the municipal councils and public works department. The guideline was prepared based on various principles of universal access and safety. The priority on streets should be defined by the design. Equitable space allocation is a problem on our streets. Thus, an SDG-oriented approach was considered for inviting a collective framework for action. The nomenclature “streets” was used in the guideline instead of roads because it involves a whole environment and public space. The types of streets found in small cities are mostly collector or local, i.e., with a maximum speed limit of 30 km/h. There are few highways passing through the cities, where major traffic crash accidents occur as well. In the design part of the guideline, various cross sections from cities are provided as examples. In addition, intersection designs are shown for improved safety along with services and markings, signage, hawker's spaces, and green spaces. Thus, it becomes a street for all.  4.4 Air pollution in small cities (SDG targets 3.9 and 11.6) The main research question in the project was “How different is the status of air quality in small cities of India?” PM 2.5 is one the most dangerous air pollutants. When inhaled, there are very less chances of it coming out of one's body. It breaches into the blood vessels and affects the entire body. The understanding of air pollution needs to go beyond city limits or boundaries. It needs to be dealt with at a regional/state/national level. For example, the decongestion of Delhi by introducing peripheral expressways has not considerably helped in improving the quality of air. The status of air quality monitoring in India was shown on a national scale. There are various parts of the country that do not have air pollution monitoring sensors. Historical air pollution data were gathered for Patiala and Bulandshahr (data for Nainital were not available) from pollution control boards. These were mostly confined to particulate matter pollution, and both cities were found to exceed the WHO as well the Indian standards, throughout the year. The annual monitoring conducted as part of the project in the three cities, i.e., Patiala, Bulandshahr, and Nainital is directly linked to the indicators for SDG targets 3.9 and 11.6. Low-cost air quality sensors were used in these cities for particulate matter monitoring. These instruments were verified against the government sensors used by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and they worked satisfactorily. These monitors were installed based on their immediate environment: one near the highest traffic concentration in the city, one near the periphery of the city, and one near the regional agricultural area.• Particulate matter pollution is very high in Patiala and Bulandshahr. Nainital, being a hill city, has lower levels of particulate pollution (however, high pollution levels were observed in some months of the year).  • Over the year, the pollution level was found to be 3–4 times higher than the requirement of the Indian standards.  • In a day, the pollution level was found to be high throughout. The mornings have a higher pollution level and it decreases as the day passes. This is a similar observation to that in other urban areas of the country.    From the data collected over a one-year period for different locations in the cities, almost the same readings were observed. Thus, we need to think beyond cities.  4.5 Governance issues in localizing SDGs in small cities: challenges and opportunities The main research question was “How do we localize SDGs in small cities?” It is related to institutional structures, overlapping of responsibilities between authorities and lack of capacity in the local bodies. Issues of governance exist in all cities irrespective of the size of the city. Currently, road safety, public transportation, and air pollution issues are dealt with at the state and national levels, but a bottom–up approach would be more appropriate and effective because city municipalities are the responsible bodies to implement on the ground. To address the city level issues, the government of India awarded 18 functions to urban local bodies (municipal corporations or councils) under the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 [7 ,8 ]. The transport-related functions are urban planning, roads and bridges, public transportation, protection of the environment, and promotion of ecological aspects. These listed functions are yet not devolved to the municipal bodies and are looked upon by different authorities. Multiplicity of organization also exists in small cities, as in large cities of India. A single subject, for example transport, is looked upon by different authorities who do not interact or coordinate with each other. The existing structure of governance and issues in small cities include short tenures due to rapid transfers between decision makers, additional responsibilities on decision makers, lack of interaction between planning and engineering departments, and capacity constraints at lower tiers of the administrative and engineering departments. SDGs can be used as tools to provide ready targets to the authorities and bring them on a common working ground. The SDG implementation in India has been initiated at the national and state levels. It is not a priority at the city level. The city administration is burdened with several other responsibilities and is dependent on state finances.   5 Conclusion Small cities in India present opportunities and specific challenges for localizing mobility SDGs. Some of the important observations from this study include the following:1. The high-speed roads (national and state highways) passing through the cities are experiencing several road traffic crashes. The city corporations are not able to reduce fatalities on these stretches because these are under the jurisdiction of the National Highways Authority. Street design guidelines suggest alternate sections for these roads to ensure safety to all road users. This would require transferring the jurisdiction of these roads to city authorities.  2. A detailed analysis of road traffic crashes is very useful; however, to reduce the number of fatalities, some interventions must be implemented to achieve quick results. For example, making helmets and seatbelts compulsory, providing footpaths, and stopping drunk driving are measures that are proven and only need to be implemented well. The city administration can enforce the national law on helmets and drunk driving.  3. Incorporating SDGs and mobility into the master plan is essential. The entire transport subject is missing from our master plans. Transitioning from informal public transport to formal public transport is a critical and challenging task. It is necessary to define what public transport means (considering all forms of transport options in a city).  4. The key problem with introducing public transport is the availability of funds. No authority in India has a legal obligation to provide public transport. The constitutional amendment act of India has given the option to urban local bodies to provide public transport. Thus, access to public transport is not a right of a citizen per se. The transition of informal transport systems into public transport is an area that must be explored for all small cities.  5. An important area of concern is the legal backing for street design guidelines. Even if only few projects are implemented on the streets, they are not maintained well in our cities. Public participation needs to be taken care of while designing the streets because different road users have different aspirations. Involvement of stakeholders is another important aspect missing from the street designs.  6. Appropriation for air pollution control is crucial for developing strategies and policies to reduce air pollution. Measuring exposure levels to air pollution is another important aspect that can be considered in projects, particularly for small cities where the majority of trips are based on walking and cycling. Most of our upcoming urbanization will be in these small cities, and future public transport planning (local and regional) needs to be addressed immediately, as the number of private vehicles is growing rapidly.  7. Management of road dust and the public spaces around roads must go together. The monetary losses due to air pollution must be highlighted. In addition, financial issues lie in the air quality management system. Who will pay to improve the quality of air is a question to be addressed. Subsidies for cleaner fuel vehicles must be considered.  8. Stakeholder discussions highlighted the weaknesses of the current national mission of creating smart cities, which have promoted the formation of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to bring efficiency to the city management structure. SPVs are creating more vulnerability than mitigation. Large functions of corporations are taken care by parastatal bodies or by large consultancy firms. We need to empower the people and mayors and councilors to plan and manage their own cities. SDGs are not at all a priority of cities because they are financially so weak and busy engaging with regular duties of waste collection and release of birth and death certificates. Why can't 10% of income tax be given back to city governments? Good transport infrastructure not only promotes mobility but also helps in reducing inequity.    Therefore, the answers to the three questions listed in the introduction are as follows:1. Are SDG targets a priority of local administrations? SDGs are not a priority for several city governments. Cities need encouragement and national support to adopt and implement SDGs. We have to think how SDGs can be used to influence day-to-day decisions. SDGs can also be a part of the outcome-based budget of municipalities to make them a priority.  2. Can community engagement expedite implementation of SDG-compliant policies and investment? It is difficult to measure the outcome in the short term. Citizens who are adversely affected by several infrastructure decisions (e.g., high-speed roads through the city and poor facilities for pedestrians) do not have institutional mechanisms to express their demand. The “predict and provide” paradigm seems to dominate the decision makers and city planners.  3. What lessons can be learned from the action research strategy? Data gaps can be highlighted, and possible solutions can be developed and discussed to achieve the SDG indicators. However, ground implementation and changing the priority at various levels of governance are long processes and may require continuous efforts and demonstration projects.    The movement toward sustainable growth and sustainable urban areas requires a long-term perspective and a multidisciplinary approach in policy making and decision taking. Its fundamental premise is a wide participation at all levels of all stakeholders, i.e., citizens, planners, and decision makers. It requires comprehensive and continuous assessment of the current conditions. It is important to recognize the synergies between different parameters and trade-offs among strongly correlated parameters. These issues have been discussed and highlighted earlier [2 ,9 ]. Our understanding from the case study cities is that in fact it requires fundamental changes in the way each stakeholder perceives and understands the sustainable mobility issues and sets priorities. Short-term priorities often conflict with long-term goals. For example, in all three case study cities, the decision makers are mostly concerned about solving parking problems and congestion faced by cars. A dedicated space for pedestrians, bicycles, and public transport is acceptable as long as car traffic is not adversely affected. Sustainable mobility targets involve the development of a common mobility vision on behalf of all citizens. The current institutional structure and political discourse do not have space for this dialogue. City planners and engineers continue to practice the conventional traffic-oriented approach that aimed at maximizing network capacity, traffic volumes, and travel speed. This is in conflict with the SDG targets and the alternative transport planning approach, which focuses on people and maximizes accessibility [10 ]. Sustainable planning gives high priority to the alternative modes of transport, i.e., walking, cycling, and the use of public transport. Transport planning, first introduced as a modal-focused domain of traffic engineers, has transformed into a multidisciplinary, holistic, and long-term approach [11 ]. However, this is completely missing at the ground level among the practitioners. Localizing SDGs remains a challenge and requires long-term sustained efforts.
