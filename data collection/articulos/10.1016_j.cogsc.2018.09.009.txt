C.   This review comes from a themed issue on UN SGDs: how can sustainable chemistry contribute?  Edited by Tom Welton   Response to other articles in the special edition Contributing authors to this special issue of Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry were offered the opportunity to engage in a scientific discussion based on topics raised in the other articles accepted for publication. This is a laudable initiative which should be replicated throughout the scientific literature. This author was generally impressed by the clear desire from the other contributors to this special issue from across the chemical sector, both academic and industrial, to implement the principles of green and sustainable chemistry to solve the present and future problems facing an ever growing population. Continuing the spirit of this article, “The view from the agrochemical industry”, what follows are selected comments on the article by Burgman et al . [1]  relating to the registration of crop protection chemicals.1 Risk assessments of chemical mixtures    In section 2 of their article Burgman et al . state:Regulatory risk assessments focus on the impacts of individual chemicals, one at a time, ignoring exposure to multiple pollutants, their interactions and effects on non-target wildlife .   On the whole regulatory risk assessments are indeed carried out for individual chemicals. However regulators, including the European Commission, [2]  are aware of the challenges associated with exposure to unintentional chemical mixtures. Most crop protection chemicals are applied to the environment as formulated mixtures and may contain multiple active ingredients for which, at least in the EU, a combined risk assessment is required [3] . This may include, for example, data from tests to determine acute and/or chronic toxicity of the formulated mixture to non-target organisms. Studies have shown that only a few substances contribute to the toxicity of mixtures found in surface water and effluents with the toxicity of a mixture arising from a single substance in many instances [4] .2 Run-off and leaching    In section 3 Burgman et al . propose a hypothetical herbicide X:In this scenario, analogues of X have been used in manufacturing and food production for many years without known harmful effects. Laboratory tests do not reveal deleterious effects on test organisms. The chemical is proposed for use in a novel setting, namely, controlling weeds in agricultural crops, and is likely to find its way into waterways. Its release is politically contentious .   Often the mere presence of a chemical in water is indeed politically contentious. Risk assessments for chemicals are derived from the combination of hazard and exposure data. In the hypothetical case above laboratory tests show no hazards towards test organisms. Like all crop protection products, herbicides are tested for toxicity against a broad range of representative non-target organisms. Ecotoxicological test requirements for herbicides are focused on the likely most sensitive species, specifically aquatic algae, macrophytes and non-target terrestrial plants to derive effect and no effect levels. After the application of assessment (safety) factors these levels are compared to predicted or modelled realistic, worst-case exposure levels. In the scenario above, the overall risk of using herbicide X would be very low and deemed acceptable for use. In other situations exposure may be mitigated if necessary, for example, by the use of buffer strips to reduce run-off and spray-drift and/or the use of advanced nozzle application technology, also to reduce spray drift.3 Data generation    Further on in section 3, Burgman et al . state:Most regulators depend on information supplied by proponents, potentially creating disincentives to find problems, or to disclose them once they are discovered .   For crop protection chemicals, regulators are required to consider all relevant available data from sources including the primary literature [5]  as well as the registration process. Industry-conducted studies on chemical safety have to comply with internationally agreed test guidelines [6]  and Good Laboratory Practice [7]  which ensures a high degree of robustness of the experiment and reliability of the data. Regulatory legislation in a number of countries [8]  requires the formal reporting of information on adverse environmental, health and toxicological effects of crop protection chemicals. This includes new data generated in experimental studies including those conducted after formal registration of a crop protection chemical. Compliance with all relevant laws and regulations is one of the main pillars in the Code of Conduct published by Syngenta [9]  and equivalent documents from the other innovation-based crop protection companies [10–12] .
