                  Not only governmental regulation but also voluntary standards developed within co- or self-regulatory processes can contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, we analyze this contribution with a focus on formal standard-setting in the European Union. First, we review the limited literature on standards and sustainability and point out examples of specific SDG-related standards along the value chain. We then present results from a survey among >1000 stakeholders involved in standardization, who ranked the relevance of the SDGs and assessed how much different types of standards contribute to these goals. The results show that particularly formal standards are perceived to positively contribute to achieving the SDGs. This positive perception is most strongly pronounced for standards linked to laws, such as harmonized European standards. In light of the stakeholders' positive assessments, we argue that formal standardization could be a tool that further involves economic actors in implementing concrete measures for achieving the SDGs and that formal standards have the potential to complement already existing dedicated sustainability standards.

Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research Karlsruhe Germany       Editor: Dr. Sandra Venghaus Not only governmental regulation but also voluntary standards developed within co- or self-regulatory processes can contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, we analyze this contribution with a focus on formal standard-setting in the European Union. First, we review the limited literature on standards and sustainability and point out examples of specific SDG-related standards along the value chain. We then present results from a survey among >1000 stakeholders involved in standardization, who ranked the relevance of the SDGs and assessed how much different types of standards contribute to these goals. The results show that particularly formal standards are perceived to positively contribute to achieving the SDGs. This positive perception is most strongly pronounced for standards linked to laws, such as harmonized European standards. In light of the stakeholders' positive assessments, we argue that formal standardization could be a tool that further involves economic actors in implementing concrete measures for achieving the SDGs and that formal standards have the potential to complement already existing dedicated sustainability standards.   Keywords Sustainability  SDGs  Standards  Standardization  Stakeholders  Regulation    1 Introduction After the publication of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2016, agreed upon by the UN General Assembly, it was pointed out that solid support from a broad portfolio of stakeholders is needed, who have to work together to achieve them. In addition to national and local governments, but also international organizations initiating policies, including setting regulations including “all laws, formal and informal orders, subordinate rules, administrative formalities, and rules issued by … bodies to whom governments have delegated regulatory power” (OECD, 2021 )1  1 Due to a lack of an official OECD definition, we refer to “standards often defined by consensus and approved by a recognised body that provides, for common and repeated use, rules or guidelines for the characteristics of products, processes and organisations” in 4th edition of the Oslo Manual (OECD/Eurostat, 2018 ).  , the support of companies and civil society organizations is required to achieve the objectives (e.g., Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). More ambitious involvement from economic actors in translating the goals into concrete industry objectives and implementations might increase the SDGs' transformative impact through direct normative changes on self- or co-regulatory levels via standardization or through discursive and even institutional effects (Biermann et al., 2022 ). Montiel et al. (2021)  are grouping the 17 SDGs into six broad categories depending on whether they enable companies, in particular multinational enterprises, to create positive externalities related to knowledge, wealth, and health or to reduce negative externalities related to the overuse of natural resources, harm to social cohesion, or over-consumption. Furthermore, they position the SDGs along the value chain (Porter, 1985 ). Finally, they distinguish, on the one hand, internal investments within companies to achieve the SDGs, e.g., in the education of their employees, but also in their relationship with their suppliers and customers. On the other hand, companies also invest externally, e.g. into the public at large by supporting governmental and non-governmental organizations. Kolk (2005) , however, points to the risks associated with putting industry at the core of the sustainable development agenda due to their strong self-interest. Furthermore, she argues that voluntary changes and soft measures only lead to marginal reductions of environmental impacts but not fundamental changes in production and consumption, which, following the Porter Hypothesis (Porter and Van der Linde, 1995 )2  2 The Porter Hypothesis claims that stringent and ambitious environmental regulation can stimulate firms to innovate which in turn might increase both their productivity and eventually their competitiveness, but also the sustainability of their products. This hypothesis is in contrast to the traditional view of environmental regulation restricting firms' options and thus reducing their profits.  , require strong regulatory approaches set by governments. Different regulatory frameworks already address the SDGs. However, in most studies, calls for regulation to support the achievement of the SDGs so far have failed to reveal specific incentives and compliance mechanisms (Caiado et al., 2018 ; Van Zanten and Van Tulder, 2021 ). In contrast, Kolk (2005)  suggests that firms could take the lead in implementing environmentally responsible practices guided by voluntary codes of conduct and self-regulation, e.g., via standardization and standards, rather than awaiting more rigorous regulatory approaches through public legislation that reduce flexibility and increase compliance costs. Blind and Mangelsdorf (2016)  reveal that this strategy is present in standardization, where companies use their involvement to completely prevent unwanted (public) regulation or use standards to steer concrete implementations toward their interests. Furthermore, Flynn et al. (2019)  point to the relevance of the liberal environmental governance in the UK versus the authoritarian equivalent in China for standards in the Circular Economy. Polverini (2021)  has also recently emphasized this question for the European Union. The role of self-regulatory activities involving different stakeholders becomes further relevant in business cases for sustainability. In particular, Schaltegger et al. (2019)  highlight that these business cases should be based on mainly voluntary activities of a broad set of stakeholders, which aim to solve environmental or social problems. They should go beyond mere compliance with governmental regulations, which cannot foresee all relevant stakeholders' incentives and compliance costs. Furthermore, they elaborate that all stakeholders' framework conditions, including regulations and other institutions influencing social and environmental activities, are created by the stakeholders themselves. In particular, they point to companies' opportunities to shape self- and co-regulatory rules in stakeholder relations, which is complemented by Montiel et al. (2021) , highlighting that market-driven standards might help companies to reduce possible regulatory sanctions. Complementary, D'Amato et al. (2019)  reveal that many companies construct their sustainability practices in reference to national or international voluntary standards to perform and legitimize their sustainability efforts. Ikram et al. (2021)  even attribute specific international standards to achieve the 17 SDGs. Furthermore, standard setters have been explicitly mentioned by Hörisch et al. (2014)  as a specific stakeholder group, which, in coordination with regulators, creates framework conditions that encourage stakeholders to promote sustainability, which is in line with Kivimaa et al. (2019)  perceiving standard-setting bodies as niche intermediaries driving transitions toward sustainability. In detail, Hörisch et al. (2014)  perceive setting standards as an instrument that increases awareness among companies and other stakeholders to create common sustainability-oriented mindsets. Recently, the European Union stressed the importance of the involvement of the respective stakeholders in the standardization processes, which can increase openness, transparency, and inclusiveness within their published standardization strategy (European Commission, 2022 ). Kaplinsky and Morris (2018)  even go a step further by analyzing the implementation of standards. They confirm that compliance with international standards can enhance producers' capabilities in meeting several SDGs. Complementary to the few studies pointing to standardization as a stakeholder-based option to achieve the SDGs, Tuczek et al. (2018)  highlight the relevance of stakeholder theories in their review of theories that contribute to our understanding of standards. These theories take an external view by analyzing the influence of different stakeholders on firms' implementation of voluntary sustainability standards. As argued above, they refer to studies claiming that companies motivated by external pressure fail to improve their performance by adopting voluntary standards just for legitimacy reasons. However, little large-scale evidence is available about organizations', and particularly companies', preferences to contribute to the SDGs. Yamane and Kaneko (2022)  report the results of a nationwide online survey conducted in Japan, which reveals gaps between other stakeholders' preferred SDGs and companies' priorities, e.g., regarding SDG 2, “Zero Hunger”, which is preferred by the public but deprioritized by industry. In contrast, companies put SDG 8, “Decent Work and Economic Growth,” on top. More generally, Allen et al. (2019)  present a multi-criteria decision analysis framework to prioritize SDGs based on evidence- and science-based approaches. The objective of our paper is to focus on standards as an instrument to contribute to the SDGs, which has been only implicitly addressed in previous research and provide a first broad empirical evidence base of stakeholder perspectives. Our large-scale survey of German stakeholders involved in standardization furthermore adds to the empirical evidence presented by the Japanese study conducted by Yamane and Kaneko (2022)  on the relevance of SDGs. Additionally, the stakeholders' assessments of the contribution of different types of standards to the SDGs complement studies about specific standards' relationship to the SDGs, like the ISO 14001 series on environmental management (see, e.g., the recent overview in Ikram et al., 2021 ), but also other about specific sustainability standards released by private organizations (Bissinger et al., 2020 ; Schleifer et al., 2022 ). Eventually, this allows us to derive general recommendations about the use of standards for achieving the SDGs, addressing policymakers, standard-setting bodies, and their involved stakeholders, in particular companies. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next chapter, we elaborate on the relationship between SDG and standards based on the limited literature. We then present the methodology applied in surveying the stakeholders involved in standardization, followed by the presentation and discussion of the survey results. In conclusion, we summarize the main findings, provide recommendations and discuss the limitations of our approach.  2 Literature review Standards and standardization promote the development of new technologies and innovations and contribute to their adoption and diffusion, both through market-based and non-market-based mechanisms (Blind, 2016 ). Standardization processes can contribute to the spread of societal missions and play an essential role in tackling the SDGs by coordinating the diverse interests of various stakeholders and transferring knowledge and rules between them (e.g., Balzarova and Castka, 2012 ). However, established standards can also hinder the diffusion of innovations and the transition to more sustainable solutions due to lock-in effects. Standardization processes are mainly driven by the industry's interest in exploiting the market-based economic functions of standards (Blind, 2004 ; Swann, 2000 ), i.e., realizing economies of scale via variety reduction, generating positive network externalities by achieving compatibility, and reducing information asymmetries. In addition, standards can endow innovations and new technology with legitimacy (e.g., Botzem and Dobusch, 2012 ) and build trust through detailed disclosure of technical characteristics. As a result, they can enhance the diffusion of innovations, strengthen ecosystems, and potentially generate follow-on innovation. Particularly in emerging technologies, standards can be more efficient in supporting innovation than public regulation (Blind et al., 2017 ), recently illustrated by Brown et al. (2022)  for hydrogen, graphene, synthetic biology, and quantum computing. Furthermore, in addition to their role in the private sector, standards can also promote the diffusion of innovation within the public sector by referencing public procurement (Blind, 2008 ). In the processes governed by standards-setting organizations (Baron et al., 2019 ), various stakeholders from science, technology, and markets interact to create a consensus on rules for new technologies. Stakeholders represent the supply side, i.e., researchers, technology providers, manufacturers, service providers, the demand side, and the public. Manufacturers located downstream in value chains are interested in introducing their preferences into standards related to components, products, and even services, which they then integrate into their own more complex products or systems. As potential buyers of products and services, public institutions have an interest in influencing the specifications of standards according to their preferences related to costs or price and quality, ease of operation, and environmental impacts. Representatives of organizations dedicated to protecting the environment and consumer and worker representatives have to be involved, as recently reconfirmed by the European Commission (2022) , to assure that the interests of their stakeholders are adequately acknowledged in the final specification of standards. Standardization is a form of transnational regulation that, especially in its function in the regulation of the EU Single Market, ranges from purely private self-regulation to playing a co-regulatory role in which various stakeholders are called on to supplement “hard law” (Kallestrup, 2017 ).3  3 For a deeper discussion on “standards vs. regulation” see Egyedi et al. (2018) .   Under the New Approach and the New Legislative Framework4  4 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/new-legislative-framework_en .  , legislators can influence standardization by requesting the specification of abstract rules in standard-development mandates given to standards-setting organizations and participating industries. Such mandated, “harmonized” European standards (HES) referenced in EU regulations and directives play an essential role in defining the criteria for firms' access to the Single Market. This role equips standards with an indirect regulatory power that the industry recognizes (Blind and Mangelsdorf, 2016 ) and is often even perceived as de-facto law (Heß and Blind, 2019 ). The approach forms a relationship where, on the one hand, European regulators delegate rule-making in exchange for quicker uptake of technological development into laws. The injection of abstract goals, on the other hand, creates an impactful co-regulative tool (Borraz, 2007 ) that allows regulators to promote specific innovation, consequently aligning technological trajectories with societal goals. Finally, international harmonization of regional standards, and the development of explicitly international standards, contribute to global regimes (Fuenfschilling and Binz, 2018 ), influencing transformation dynamics beyond national or regional borders, which the primarily national public regulations cannot achieve, as, e.g., already highlighted in the Porter Hypothesis (Porter and Van der Linde, 1995 ). In addition, Miörner and Binz (2021)  reveal the option that features of a new socio-technical configuration can be constructed by international expert networks of a global niche, which are then, in parallel institutionalized via international standards. Recently, international standards-setting organizations have extended their missions by explicitly including the achievement of the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) as an evaluation criterion for standards and the work of the developers of standards. ISO (the International Organization for Standardization), IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission), and ITU (the International Telecommunication Union) have published strategy papers and videos that demonstrate their efforts to meet the SDGs. By mapping their standards to specific SDGs, ISO has even quantified their contribution to the different goals. The institutions' push puts several new goals onto the standardization agenda, which has been focused so far on contributing to increased productivity, quality, safety, and interoperability. While these traditional goals are mostly subsumed under SDG 9, “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure”, the focus now aspires to include other goals such as ensuring “sustainable consumption and production patterns” (SDG 12) or “taking action to combat climate change and its impacts” (SDG 13). However, the academic and scientific debate on the contribution of standards and standardization to sustainability is still in its infancy. Bissinger et al. (2020)  are surprised about the lack of investigations into the potential contribution of standards to SDG achievement, which has not changed much (Schleifer et al., 2022 ). Based on the approach by Montiel et al. (2021)  to cluster the SDGs according to their generation of positive and the reduction of negative externalities along the value chain5  5 Following Niestroy (2016) , Schleifer et al. (2022)  cluster the SDGs according to (1) people-centered goals; (2) goals related to the production, distribution, and delivery of services; (3) goals related to the conservation and protection of natural resources and ecosystems; and (4) supporting goals.  , we elaborate on where standards can play an influential role. Here, we also rely on examples of ISO standards proposed by Ikram et al. (2021) , which have been validated by going through the abstracts of the standards mentioned by Ikram et al. (2021) , but also complemented by further well-known examples. Starting with the very beginning of the value chain, i.e., knowledge and other inputs relevant to the production process, SDG 4 aims to achieve inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. This goal is promoted by standardization and standards through their function as knowledge transfer channels. For example, ISO 21001 sets rules for management systems for educational organizations, and ISO 29993 for learning services outside formal education, including all types of life-long learning. The knowledge and technology transfer function of standards (see Blind and Gauch, 2009 ) is also essential for SDG 9, i.e., building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. Here, ISO 56002 provides general guidance for an innovation management system to organizations. In particular, related to innovation, standards can generally play different roles (Blind, 2016 ) along the different phases of the research and innovation life cycle (Blind and Gauch, 2009 ). Turning to the role of standards to reduce negative externalities, i.e., the overuse of natural resources, at the very beginning of the value chains, they can help to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, to sustainably manage forests, to combat desertification, and to halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss (SDG 15). This is, for example, addressed in ISO 14055 about good practices for combatting land degradation and desertification. Furthermore, SDG 6 addresses the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which is supported by several standards on water management, such as ISO 24518, which relates to drinking water and wastewater services, and water utility crisis management. ISO 24521 on the management of essential on-site domestic wastewater services or ISO 30500, which refers to non-sewer sanitation systems and establishes general safety and performance requirements for designing and testing prefabricated integrated treatment units. Complementary to water, SDG 7 targets access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Here, ISO 50001 on energy efficiency management is highly relevant. Finally, and probably most urgently, SDG 13 aims at combatting climate change and its impacts. Among the numerous attributable standards, ISO 14001 on environmental management stands out most prominently. Turning to the production and distribution processes themselves, the following SDGs are relevant according to the taxonomy presented by Montiel et al. (2021) . First, SDG 8 creates a focus on sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. It can be argued that standards' productivity-enhancing functions generally support the achievement of this goal. Furthermore, several standards suggest a direct contribution. For example, ISO 45001, which sets occupational health and safety rules, can help organizations improve employee safety, reduce workplace risks, and create safer working conditions. For some SDGs in the cluster of “wealth-increasing goals”, finding specific exemplary standards is more difficult. Especially SDG 1, ending poverty in all its forms everywhere, makes concrete connections hard due to its genericity. However, Ikram et al. (2021)  mention ISO 20400 guiding organizations in integrating sustainability within procurement and ISO 37001 on the anti-bribery management system that targets transparency and trust related to organizations' credibility and reputation. Another example of a goal that can be assigned to the production and distribution cluster but connects less easily to standards is SDG 5, which aims at gender equality and empowering all women and girls. Ikram et al. (2021)  only mention the generic ISO 26000 on social responsibility. The SDGs related to the stage of production and distribution reducing negative externalities via reducing harm to social cohesion, i.e., SDG 10 (reducing inequality within and among countries), can be supported by standards in general, which are created in a consensual process and are accessible to all interested producers of goods and services. Consequently, the main characteristics of products within a country and even across countries and, therefore, the perceived utility of their consumers are harmonized by implementing common standards. However, standards that precisely address inequality are rare. SDG 11, to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, can be supported by standards, e.g., ISO 37101, which guides cities and communities in establishing sustainable development policies. SDG 16, promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels could theoretically be supported by standards. In practice, only selected standards, e.g., ISO 37001 about anti-bribery management systems or ISO 19600 offering guidelines for compliance management systems, have been developed so far. Finally, Montiel et al. (2021)  attribute SDG 17 to strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development to the cluster about reducing harm to social cohesion. Standardization at the global level is such a global partnership, but no specific standards contribute explicitly to this SDG. In the last stages of the value chain, use and dispose, the increasing externalities are related to health, according to Montiel et al. (2021) . On the one hand, SDG 2, ending hunger, achieving food security and improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture, can be promoted by nutrition and food standards (e.g., ISO 22000 on food safety management), but also by the general environmental management standard ISO 14001. On the other hand, SDG 3, ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all ages, can be supported by standards on medical devices. Finally, reducing negative externalities in the last stages of the value chain can be achieved by limiting over-consumption. On the one hand, SDG 12 also addresses sustainable consumption patterns, which second-hand goods can achieve. Their cross-border trade is facilitated by ISO 20245. On the other hand, SDG 14 is focused on the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources, which can be supported, e.g., by ISO 5020, which addresses waste reduction and treatment on fishing vessels.6  6 Schleifer et al. (2022)  go even one step further and link >200 sustainability standards to the various targets of the SDGs.  Table 1   provides an overview of the SDGs and a selection of ISO standards linked to the different stages of the supply chains presented by Montiel et al. (2021) . Based on the illustrated linkages of particular ISO standards to specific SDGs, our paper investigates the relationship between standards and the SDGs from the perspective of standard-setting stakeholders to answer the following main research questions:• Can and do standards contribute to achieving the SDGs?  • To which SDGs do or can standards contribute most?  • Does the assessment of the stakeholders align with the portfolio of the already existing ISO standards?  • Which types of standards are most appropriate (or promising) to contribute to the SDGs?     3 Methods We surveyed standardization stakeholders' perceptions of the SDGs by using the German Standardization Panel (DNP) to address a broad range of organizations (especially firms) active in standardization. The DNP is a yearly firm-level panel that serves as a basis for research on standard-setting activities, the implementation of standards (e.g., Blind and Müller, 2020 ), and the effects of standards on entrepreneurial success. Next to the recurring panel section, we included a special section on SDGs in the 2019 questionnaire. Of the >22,000 experts contacted in October 2019, almost 1000 responded to the survey, yielding a response rate of just under 4.5 % (which matches that of the previous waves). A high response rate for the special section focusing on sustainability and the 17 SDGs suggests that standardization experts were very interested in this topic. The special section included a short explanatory text summarizing the SDGs and their background. We then asked the respondents to assess the relevance of SDGs in general and the contribution of standards to achieving those SDGs. Goals were defined as “relevant” if the respondents assessed their organization or industry to have made a particular contribution to them or if changes introduced by an organization or industry were generally considered to have a pronounced impact on their achievement. In addition, we surveyed stakeholders' assessments of “untapped potentials”: Can standards and standardization support organizations better in achieving their sustainability goals? What are concrete suggestions for improvement? Overall, the relevant part of the questionnaire comprised three Likert-scale questions, one ranking question, and two free-text questions.7  7 The complete questionnaire is available here https://www.normungspanel.de/en/ .   The ranking question allowed respondents to select up to five relevant SDGs and order them according to perceived relevance. Subsequent questions that addressed SDGs individually used this selection as filter. The aggregate relevance of SDGs was estimated using a weighted average where rankings corresponded to weights, with the highest-ranked SDGs assigned five points per respondent, the second-highest four points, and so on. We further used data from several variables from the recurring panel section to differentiate answers by participants' and affiliated organizations' properties, such as position in the organization, size (number of employees), industry, or standard-setting activities (e.g., number of seats in committees at different SSOs). Instead of asking to rate each of the 17 goals (which, as pre-tests showed, would have led to high dropout rates), we implemented a ranking question in which respondents could select and order the SDGs that were most relevant to them (max. five). This selection filtered subsequent questions that addressed specific SDGs. We subdivided the questions that targeted standards and SDGs by type of standard, employing a taxonomy that had proven robust in prior panel waves and which participants were already accustomed to from questions in the panel section. The main goals were to differentiate a) formal standards  (those developed at recognized standard-setting organizations that follow open, transparent, and consensus-based processes, see, e.g., Baron et al., 2019 ) from informal standards (developed at industry consortia, internal company standards, or informal de-facto market standards), and, in order to explore the relationship to public regulation, b) standards with formalized relationship to laws  (e.g., by being referenced by EU directives) from those without. The taxonomy accordingly distinguished de-facto standards, consortia standards, company standards, technical rules and specifications (as the “less formal” pre-stage to technical standards), national standards (developed at the national standards bodies), national standards that were referenced by (national) laws, European standards (developed at the European standards organizations CEN, CENELEC, or ETSI), European standards referenced by (EU) laws (HES), and formal international standards (developed at ISO, IEC, or ITU). Of the approximately 1000 answers included in the analysis, 67 % represented companies (or groups) or, less often, other types of organizations (see Table 2  ). These organizations fell into the categories of public administration (mainly representing the executive, e.g., cities or state/federal ministries and agencies), universities and research institutes, plus (in fewer cases) federations or associations (e.g., non-profit organizations). In cases where multiple respondents represented the same organization, a single representative was chosen manually. In addition, 33 % of all answers were given by experts, who, instead of revealing their affiliation, answered from the perspective of a company that they deemed representative of their industry. Respondents from smaller companies (up to 50 employees) were most active in upper management positions. At larger companies, participants worked in R&D or quality management departments. A technical standardization background was most frequently stated by participants in companies with >1000 employees. A total of 26 % of the participants were executive managers, 23 % worked in R&D departments, 12 % worked in dedicated standardization departments, and 11 % had a background in quality management. The majority of responding organizations (80 %) were located in Germany. Most foreign companies had their headquarters in Europe (12 %) or the US (5 %). Companies were almost equally distributed across size groups (<50, 50–249, 250–999, 1000+ employees). It was, therefore, also possible to represent the view of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs, <250 employees), which account for 51 % of the sample. While the proportion of smaller companies was highest for service-related activities (>50 %), answers from groups of companies with 1000+ employees came mainly from industry, particularly automotive engineering, the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, and electrical engineering.  4 Results Based on the approximately 1000 answers from stakeholders involved in standardization processes at the German Standardization Body DIN, we generated the following results (see Fig. 1  ). SDG 9, “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure,” was voted into first place by 149 organizations (15.5 %), followed by SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-being” (14.8 %), in second place, and SDG 13, “Climate Action” (11.3 %) in third place, which was also among the top priorities among Japanese companies (Yamane and Kaneko, 2022 ). This ranking was also confirmed by the ranking point system that accounted for the weighted second to fifth ranks. SDG 8, “Decent Work and Economic Growth,” and SDG 12, “Responsible Consumption and Production,” were often ranked fourth and fifth. Other goals that were often considered relevant were SDG 4, “Quality Education,” and SDG 7, “Affordable and Clean Energy”. The prioritization of the goals revealed specific industry-specific differences. For example, respondents from the automotive engineering and metal industries, in particular, chose the goal SDG 9, “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure”. At the same time, SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-being,” was the most important sustainable development goal for medical engineering companies. The goals that were overall least often selected were SDG 10, “Reducing Inequality”, SDG 14, “Life Below Water”, SDG 15, “Life On Land”, SDG 16, “Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions,” and SDG 5, “Gender Equality,”. This ranking reflects the stakeholders' tendency to see their contribution more in economic and technical areas than in social issues, while environmental goals were dominated by SDG 13, “Climate Action”. Overall, the assessment of the standardization stakeholders correlates significantly positively with the number of standards ISO attributed to the SDGs (see Fig. 2  ). Standards were overall perceived to positively contribute to SDG achievement (Fig. 3  ). The participants associated the most positive influence on achieving Sustainable Development Goals with formal  standards. On average, the most significant influence was exerted by harmonized European standards, followed by international standards. Overall, standards referred to by laws on the national or European level were perceived to have a more substantial influence. In contrast, de-facto standards set by single or small groups of companies without the involvement of other stakeholders were assessed to have even a negative impact by firms active in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, metal production, and consumer goods industries. Consortia standards released by international and often industry-driven organizations received the lowest assessment by the experts engaged in the national standardization body regarding their influence on the SDGs in electrical engineering, metal production, and professional and scientific services and certification and testing. All other industries were relatively neutral in their respective ratings. This finding is in line with Heß and Blind (2019) . They show that compliance with standards, referred to as by-laws, is crucial and that compliance with harmonized standards is even de facto mandatory for many companies and other organizations. Rules that promote sustainable development goals are thus particularly effective when defined in harmonized standards. Standards were perceived to contribute most to SDG 5, “Clean Water and Sanitation,” and SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-Being”, but also to SDG 11, “Sustainable Cities and Communities,” and SDG 13, “Climate Action”. These goals refer to highly regulated areas where, in turn, standards are more likely linked to public regulation. We compared stakeholders' perspectives on the relevance of sustainable development goals with the number of ISO standards assigned to each SDG (see Fig. 4  ). The comparison revealed a significant correlation (Spearman rank coefficient of 0.78). Overall, the standardization output at ISO, i.e., ISO standards, had a similar focus on SDG 9, “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure,” and SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-Being”. On the one hand, this is consistent with two of the main functions of standards, the establishment of technical interoperability and safety. On the other hand, the overlap between the perceived relevance and the coverage by standards is somewhat more divergent regarding SDGs such as SDG 13, “Climate Action,” or SDG 8, “Decent Work and Economic Growth”. This finding can also be explained by the stronger emphasis on public regulation than standardization as a coordination mechanism in these areas (see Heß and Blind, 2019 ). In 2021, ISO assigned most of the ISO standards to the SDGs. As a consequence, the correlation coefficient shrank below 0.50. The new assignment grants even more relevance to SDG 9, “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure,” with now >12,000 assigned standards. The results showed that standards that were perceived to support the achievement of those SDGs more strongly were rated as more relevant by the participants. A connection between standards and SDGs can again be observed in cases where technology plays a central role. For example, SDG 5, “Clean Water and Sanitation”, was perceived to receive the broadest support by standards. However, the most relevant SDG 9, “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure”, and SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-Being”, can also be achieved by relying on standards. In contrast, standards played a less prominent role in the realization of social goals such as SDG 2, “Zero Hunger” (see Zhao et al., 2020  for a detailed analysis of specific ISO standards), SDG 1, “No Poverty”, and SDG 5 “Gender Equality.”8  8 See Heß (2020)  on the limited gender equality in standardization, which might be one factor for the limited impact of standards on “gender equality”.   Participants were further asked whether standardization can provide even more  robust support for achieving sustainability goals. They “partly” agreed with this statement or said it was “rather true”. The potential for more substantial support was more strongly seen by universities, research institutes, federations, and associations, as well as certification and testing bodies. In contrast, the construction industry and consumer goods manufacturers were, on average, more neutral in their views. Furthermore, particularly participants who had prioritized the objectives of SDG 14, “Life Below Water”, SDG 13, “Climate Action”, and SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-Being,” expressed a desire for more substantial support by standardization. Almost 200 participants answered the open question on how standardization could increase its contribution to achieving the SDGs. The diverse and relatively comprehensive answers showed that the topic raised interest and was accepted by the participating organizations. Most responses (52 %) targeted the design of standards and the standardization process. Participants notably suggested more explicit references to the SDGs, for example, by clearly naming relevant goals in the introductory texts of standards and by concisely defining concrete, measurable requirements related to sustainability. Frequently raised topics in this context were “extended product lifetimes, resource conservation,” and “recycling”. More diverse participation in the standardization process, for example, through a better representation of stakeholders outside the industry as requested by the European Commission (European Commission, 2022 ), was seen to potentially improve the consideration of such objectives. This request was complemented by the demand for better involvement of emerging and developing countries in developing international standards. Some participants pointed out that standardization needs faster processes to keep pace with changing societal objectives. A further focal point was the perceived necessity of representing SDGs more strongly at the strategic level to establish links between separate areas of standardization and thus be able to pursue overarching objectives more effectively. A smaller group of participants (24 %) argued similarly, for whom particularly more international harmonization was critical to standards contributing more to the SDGs (as also argued by Manning and Reinecke, 2016 ). In the opinion of these respondents, regional objectives should be coordinated better, and inconsistent public regulation should be removed. In addition, countries that put a minor focus on sustainability should be encouraged to increase their efforts by employing international standards. An equally large proportion (24 %) saw the potential for improvement in the application of standards, e.g., by better monitoring the correctness of implementations and a more significant commitment through a closer relationship with legislation, especially in the case of standards that promote the SDGs. Notably, especially respondents from SMEs (21 %) mentioned better access to standards and more straightforward application. In their view, standard texts should be kept more straightforward and, at best, contain concrete implementations and best practices. Furthermore, the acceptance and diffusion of standards should be increased by reducing the cost of participation and enhancing access to standardization documents for stakeholders with limited resources (as already discussed by Zhao et al., 2020 ).  5 Discussion We examined the corporate perspective on standards and (the UN's) sustainable development goals. Results show that the stakeholders involved in the German standardization organizations see a clear link between standards and SDGs. Moreover, achieving the SDGs is perceived to be positively influenced by formal standards, especially by harmonized European and international standards. However, the relevance of SDGs and the associated role of standards reveal distinctive priorities. SDGs that are seen as particularly relevant by participants are related to industry, innovation, infrastructure, health, and climate: SDG 9, “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure,” was voted into first, followed by SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-being” in second, and SDG 13 “Climate Action” in third place. A positive contribution of standards, however, was most prominently associated with SDG 5, “Clean Water and Sanitation”, and SDG 3, “Good Health and Well-Being”, but also with SDG 11, “Sustainable Cities and Communities”, and SDG 13, “Climate Action”. Reconsidering the clustering of the SDGs along the value chain and being divided into promoting positive and reducing negative externalities presented by Montiel et al. (2021) , standards are assessed to be more effective to those attributed to the very beginning of the value chain compared to the following stages. Furthermore, standards are evaluated to be more impactful in reducing negative externalities than promoting positive ones. This assessment is in line with the above-listed SDGs being linked to highly regulated areas where standards are more likely to be embedded in the regulatory frameworks. This finding aligns with the overarching assessment that harmonized European standards exert the most significant influence on reaching the SDGs. Overall, standards that are referred to by laws at the national or European level are assessed to be more effective in contributing to SDG achievement. This overall assessment is different from the findings by Schleifer et al. (2022) , who focus on sustainability standards released by private organizations. Based on the number of specific targets addressed, SDG 8, “Decent Work and Economic Growth,” is most relevant, whereas SDG 9, “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure,” plays a limited role according to their assessment. It is interesting to note that while, overall, stakeholders do agree that there is potential for standardization to contribute more  to the achievement of the SDGs, there appears to be a gap regarding the extent of that potential between some “practitioners” (particularly construction industry and consumer goods manufacturing) on the one hand, and “theorists” (science and associations) and standardization “insiders” (testing and certification) on the other. Insiders might generally have a positively biased view of the potential of standards. A more substantial reliance on standards for certification bodies and test laboratories would create further demand for related certifications, like ISO 14001, which would consequently benefit their business. Theorists might see potential where, in practice, concrete solutions might be hard to implement. We assume that science is driven by their conviction that their involvement in standardization contributes to the implementation of scientific evidence in standards (and that there is room for more science-based rules in standards), as revealed in previous studies as significant driving forces for their engagement (Blind et al., 2018 ; Blind and Gauch, 2009 ; Blind and Fenton, 2022 ). Another explanation for differences in perceived potential might be the heterogeneous regulatory landscape that different industries face. For example, consumer goods for the EU Single Market are already highly regulated concerning sustainability goals (e.g., through the Ecodesign Directive, the Energy Labelling Regulation, and referenced harmonized European standards). The corresponding industry might, therefore, see less room for more contribution by standards. Overall, the suggested gap between the relevance of SDGs and the potential already exploited by standards hints at potential room for improvement. Participants state that standardization could further increase its contribution to sustainability by, e.g., establishing standardization processes that generate more concrete links between standards and the SDGs and better coordinating the outputs of different sub-areas of standardization. In particular, it was recommended to create more explicit references to the SDGs in the introductions of standards and concisely define concrete, measurable indicators of the achievement of SDGs, e.g., extended product lifetimes, savings of resources, and recycling quota. Within standardization processes, more diverse participation was suggested, which has already been asked for by Hörisch et al. (2014)  and Tuczek et al. (2018) . In particular, a better representation of stakeholders outside the industry and the broader involvement of emerging and developing countries in developing international standards (Zoo et al., 2017 ) is needed. Further common suggestions focused on a better implementation of standards, more international harmonization, including better coordination of regional goals, and raising the speed of standardization processes (a request that is commonly mentioned in other contexts and is often related to the perceived lack of speed of “HAS consultants” when evaluating proposed harmonized European standards; e.g., Schulte and Blind, 2022 ). Based on the assessments of stakeholders involved in standardization, we derive the following recommendations. First, the effectiveness of standardization and standards for achieving at least the most prioritized SDGs can be improved by extending the involvement of all relevant stakeholders not only at the national but also at the international level, which should also include the participation of developing countries. Furthermore, a closer linkage of standards to public regulation, which has been identified as the most effective measure for better working toward the SDGs, can increase standards' effectiveness (e.g., also claimed by McKane et al. (2017)  in the context of climate change). Complementary, it is the perception of stakeholders that moving the SDG-relevant standardization topics toward the international standard-setting organizations also increases the effectiveness of standards to contribute to the SDGs, particularly concerning global public goods like climate, allowing humanity to survive in the long run. In addition to a broader stakeholder involvement as an approach to increase the acceptance and, therefore, the adoption of standards, the development and access to standards could be optimized to improve their implementation and eventually diffusion. The respondents' emphasis on the link to public regulation, particularly the perceived relevance of harmonized European standards, suggests particular promise for standards that are part of co-regulation to enhance the diffusion of sustainability goals in the industry. Integrating (mainly) industry stakeholders through standard-setting organizations under the EU's New Approach is an established co-regulative model with a proven track record of reconciling technological development with economic and societal goals. A mandated development of standards that take sustainable development goals into account would harness industry expertise and create concrete technical rules that go beyond the abstract definitions of the SDGs, which are seen to “lack the precision and clarity needed to meet sustainability challenges” (Yamane and Kaneko, 2022 ; Vandemoortele, 2018 ). The creation and market-diffusion of such standards could anchor and diffuse sustainable practices in the industry, potentially beyond EU borders (due to access requirements to the Single Market and coercion in supply chains), according to the Brussels effect (Vogel, 1997 ). The explicit requirement to account for sustainability in de-facto mandatory (Heß and Blind, 2019 ) formal standards (as opposed to explicit but voluntary sustainability standards) would incentivize sustainability considerations in the self-regulatory activities of concerned stakeholders. The European Commission's new standardization strategy that was launched in 2022 (European Commission, 2022 ) does indeed suggest a growing intent to shift control to the regulator, partly with the aim of “promoting EU core values” (pp. 5ff.), including sustainability (p. 9), in international standardization. Complementary to focusing on fostering the development of standards for priority topics (e.g., clean hydrogen, low-carbon cement) and overarching initiatives (Ecodesign, Sustainable Products Initiative), the European Commission wants existing standards to be reviewed to be in line with the “European Green Deal”. The prevailing opinion of stakeholders surveyed within our study appears to support such sustainability-related extensions of mission-oriented policy into standardization. Surveying stakeholders that are involved in standardization is associated with multiple limitations. First, the sample was biased toward standard-setting experts most active at DIN (the German national standards body). Therefore, the views of the directly and indirectly affected stakeholders are not considered. Since Germany has a well-developed standardization culture and is also strongly involved at the European and international levels, the results might not be transferable to other countries within and outside Europe. However, the fact that German standard-setters play a decisive role in European and international standardization can also be seen as an indication of the significance of our results. Further, it has to be noted that 10 % of the respondents were employed by organizations with headquarters outside Germany, in most cases multinational enterprises, for which we could not find significant systematic differences in assessments. Second, responses might be biased due to social desirability or strategic answering behavior (Furnham, 1986 ), meaning that the approached experts might have overassessed the contributions of standards toward SDGs. Large companies have dedicated standardization managers and departments, which might have tended to answer more positively. Particularly the answers regarding the influence of standardization on achieving the SDGs could be subject to perception bias. Here, respondents might over-appreciate standards that are referenced by laws, as the connection to law appears to be the most straightforward indicator for impact assessment, which is a complex task that, as the respondents pointed out, currently lacks measurable goals set in standards. Third, Zhao et al. (2020)  highlight that the analysis of standards' effectiveness in achieving the SDGs has to be performed on the target as done by Schleifer et al. (2022) , not the SDG level. Our explorative approach started with the ambition to address all 17 SDGs, which made it infeasible to cover all 169 specific targets in one survey. The mentioned limitations consequently lead us to an outlook for future research. First, it would be interesting to expand our approach to survey experts involved in standardization in other countries, allowing comparative analyses. Second, the recommendation to analyze the contributions of standards to the SDGs on their target level, as done by Schleifer et al. (2022)  for specific private sustainability standards, will require the selection of specific SDGs when a large-scale survey approach is applied. Consequently, in-depth follow-up surveys are needed. Third, the insights of these surveys might be combined with more qualitative information to reach more comprehensive and detailed insights, which could also address the response bias mentioned above.  6 Conclusion We analyze the relationship between standards, standard-setters, and SDGs in a first approach to the topic and present evidence of standardizing stakeholders' perceptions that formal standards can support the achievement of the SDGs. Our results highlight focal areas where standards and standard-setters can contribute and depict ideas on the “how” of this mission. Overall, particularly standards that are closely linked to laws (e.g., harmonized European standards) and formal international standards are perceived to contribute to achieving the SDGs, with the most relevant goals being SDG 9, “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure”, SDG 3 “Good Health and Well-being”, and SDG 13 “Climate Action”. However, stakeholders see a gap between the potential and the realized contribution of standards. They suggest adapting standard-setting processes to more concretely consider SDGs, increasing diversity in standard-setting committees (e.g., a stronger involvement of developing countries in international standardization), and improving coordination between different areas of standardization, as well as international harmonization, to foster the proliferation of sustainable standards. The standard-setters' depicted willingness to use formal standards to promote sustainable development and the positive assessment that they are indeed appropriate tools for this task suggests that the SSOs' SDG initiatives have the potential to be more than “SDG washing”. Formal standardization offers established processes and platforms that create legitimacy and result in a strong diffusion of its rules. The often close link to public regulation makes formal standardization a potential intermediary with the capacity to guide and influence industrial sustainability beyond the sphere of directly involved actors. Formal standards that actively consider the SDGs could create sustainability spill-overs into industries with a previously weak focus on sustainability, integrating the knowledge and interests of diverse actors and further mainstreaming sustainable technologies and strategies.
