                  People with albinism (PWA) often face discrimination due to people being superstitious and believing in myths. These problems occur especially frequently in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the prevalence of PWA is very high. PWA additionally suffers from a variety of health issues like extreme sensitivity to the sun or impaired vision. Affected people often do not know enough about their condition or are not able to get physical and mental support to enhance their situations and current mHealth solutions do not cover this area and topic yet. Therefore a low-fidelity prototype was developed in cooperation with six experts including two people affected by albinism. The prototype includes 38 requirements that were identified within a user-centered design approach. The main goal of this gamified application is to empower PWA by educating them about all aspects of their condition, associated myths, raising awareness about the importance of appropriate protection, and building their resilience, self-confidence, and coping skills.

Stock Vienna 1040 Austria       People with albinism (PWA) often face discrimination due to people being superstitious and believing in myths. These problems occur especially frequently in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the prevalence of PWA is very high. PWA additionally suffers from a variety of health issues like extreme sensitivity to the sun or impaired vision. Affected people often do not know enough about their condition or are not able to get physical and mental support to enhance their situations and current mHealth solutions do not cover this area and topic yet. Therefore a low-fidelity prototype was developed in cooperation with six experts including two people affected by albinism. The prototype includes 38 requirements that were identified within a user-centered design approach. The main goal of this gamified application is to empower PWA by educating them about all aspects of their condition, associated myths, raising awareness about the importance of appropriate protection, and building their resilience, self-confidence, and coping skills.   Keywords Albinism  Sustainable development goals  mHealth  Gamification   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction Many projects worldwide deal with extreme poverty, hunger and child mortality, support gender equality, operate on achieving universal primary education and improve maternal health, to support, achieve and spread the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These were established by the United Nations (UN) in 2015, the goals aim to provide basic needs such as water, food, education, health services, energy and work for all people across the world until 2030 [1] . The UN established MDGs (Millenium Development Goals) in 2000, serving as the basis for the SDGs. MDGs were triggered by extreme poverty and hunger, very high child mortality rate, low primary school net enrollment rate, gender inequality, high maternal mortality ratio, the rapid expansion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria and other diseases.[2,3]  Albinism is a widespread condition that affects approximately one in every 20,000 persons in the world, [4] . The prevalence rates vary significantly among different regions of the world, out of which Sub-Saharan Africa leads with a frequency of “up to 10 times the world figure” [5] . Hong, E. S., et al. [6]  examined the prevalence rate of albinism in Africa by conducting a systematic literature review, and found diverse data among several African countries, reaching from 1:15,000 in Nigeria, 1:4922 in Zimbabwe (up to 1:1000 in Tonga tribe), 1:3900 in South Africa, and 1:1400 in Tanzania. Even though this information does not yield an overall view of the prevalence of albinism in these countries, they do indicate that its occurrence in Sub-Saharan Africa is noteworthy and that the rate of the population at risk is high. Albinism is a genetic condition, which is inherited and causes an abnormal melanin biosynthesis, which is caused by missense, frameshift and nonsense mutations of several genes [7] . Melanin is a pigment found in the epidermis of the skin, where it protects the epidermal cells against harmful ultraviolet light, whereby the melanocytes (melanin-producing cells) act as sensory cells of the epidermis [7] . PWA also struggle with poor vision, where near and far vision is impaired [8–10] . The visual acuity is decreased due to the missing pigmentation during eye development [11] . A study found that only 64.1% (n =   50) of the researched PWA group reported good color vision [12] . It is recommended to provide specific material and resources for visually impaired pupils, e.g. written with high contrast, magnifiers, etc. [13,14] . Providing information to visually impaired people can be challenging [15] . The use of visual, tactile or auditory methods is supportive but needs to be selected with great caution not to overwhelm users [16] . Using auditory input and output has been found to increase accessibility for visually impaired users [17] . PWA living in Africa are surrounded by multiple factors threatening their physical, mental and social well-being. Originating from the multiple myths and superstitions held by the majority of society, these factors include murders, barbarous violations, social discrimination, resulting in inadequate jobs, lack of education, and unexpressed personal identity [4–6,18,19] . The void of knowledge is filled with myths and superstition, which leads to stigmatization, with is strongly impacting the psychological well-being of PWA [20] . Therefore communication of research is of critical importance. Education can help people understand the condition and let go of misunderstandings. It can also support PWA to learn about their condition and teach them proper management of their disorder [5] . PWA are eager to learn more about their condition. A study conducted by Lund showed that 99.3% (n =   137) of participants would like to know more about albinism [21] . So far PWA have to travel to a clinic to receive counseling and education. Mobile phones are not used for counseling because no specific application was developed to interact with patients [22] . Mobile phones have a great potential to deliver health care services [23] . The difficulties, that PWA encounter, occur not only as a consequence of the social stigma but also because of their physical condition. By having little or no melanin at all, they are extremely sensitive to the sun. Consequently, chronic exposure to the sun leads to sunburns, which in turn produces solar lentigines (small brown spots, occurring because of a high number of melanocytes), photoaging (heavily wrinkled skin), elastosis (accumulation of elastin in the dermis of the skin), keratosis (growth of keratin on the skin), all of which are related to skin cancer. The risk of developing skin cancer among PWA is one thousand times higher compared to the general population, with 100% of them exhibiting sun-induced skin damage by the age of 1 [4,24] . Technological aspects are also important in terms of delivering a mHealth solution, these also often pose challenges. Different factors like good network coverage, good usability, and energy sources for charging devices or replacement devices were mentioned while analyzing different other articles and factors mentioned there [25] . Another classification of the challenges structures them into 4 aspects: economy, environment, technology, and user acceptance [26] . In an overview of conducted mHealth interventions to reduce maternal and child mortality in [27]  it was concluded that such solutions have a positive impact in that domain. The development of a valid and reliable assessment instrument for predicting mHealth adoption by patients in the developing world also showed significance among eight constructs (e.g. Language, literacy, and training or governance) [28] . To enhance motivation in the user gamification can be used, this is defined as using game design elements in a non-game context [29] . They are used to provide an engaging interface while the user is actively solving the underlying problem [30] . Therefore, the main goal of the here presented results is to support the education of PWA about all aspects of their condition, to break myths associated with it, to raise awareness about the importance of appropriate protection, build their resilience, self-confidence, and coping skills, and to empower them. This should be accomplished with the help of a mobile health (mHealth) application, which should also include gamification elements as a motivational factor. The following contributions were done to do so: extensive literature research to find similar solutions (none were found), requirements engineering to identify the main aspects needed from involved stakeholders and PWA (overall 38 requirements identified), create a low-fidelity prototype including gamification elements and evaluate it together with experts. The following sections are structured as follows: Section 2  contains related work, and Section 3  describes the used methodology to get the results which are outlined in Section 4 . It concludes with a discussion in Section 5 , followed by a conclusion and future work in Section 6 .  2 Related work Related work regarding PWA and their special needs in the context of IT or mHealth is quite scarce. The authors were not able to find any related work focusing on education for PWAs. Therefore different mHealth projects will be presented. Three projects focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa are MOTECH (Mobile Technology for Community Health) [31] , APAS (ANC/PMTCT Adherence System) [32] , and inSCALE (Innovations at Scale for Community Access and Lasting Effects) [33] . These three projects focus on the rise of awareness and change of the established traditional attitudes and comprehending the impact they can have on the aspired outcome. In 2005 the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the UN Development Programme launched 14 operational units across 10 Sub-Saharan African countries. These so-called Millennium Villages are clusters of several adjoining villages, covering from 5000 to 70,000 people. In these areas, the so-called Millennium Villages Project (MVP) was implemented, with the main aim to support countries in achieving the MDG [34] . Community Health Workers (CHWs), are trained to provide certain basic health services in that area — these CHWs are working in their area of origin, which are often places from rural areas in developing countries, where the shortage of healthcare professionals are common [32] . They also use innovative ways to informally use their phones in their work to address gaps in healthcare infrastructure and resourcing [35] . To improve the performance of these CHWs, APAS [32]  was introduced, a mHealth application which uses text messages to coordinate and organize their activities in the domain of antenatal care (ANC; preventive healthcare in order to treat and prevent potential health problems of mothers and their child throughout the course of pregnancy) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. Their project was implemented in Sauri, Western Kenya, in 2010, and has served 800 women and 109 CHWs over the course of 2 years. For every enrolled woman, their pregnancy state, as well as their past and future appointments are entered into the APAS system, which sends a text message to the responsible CHW when the woman should be reminded about her forthcoming appointment or should do a follow-up. Active as of July 2010 in Ghana, the MOTECH (Mobile Technology for Community Health) project [31]  aims to improve antenatal and neonatal care by using mobile phones to improve health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Their project consists of two services: • “Mobile Midwife” application: Text messages (in English) or voice messages (in English or local language) are used to provide pregnant women and their families with information about their pregnancy. This occurs every week and the information the women obtain is time-specific and is either a reminder (about a specific treatment), advice (tips for good health and lifestyle), or educational information (about healthy practices during or after pregnancy).  • “Client Data Application”: A Java 2 Platform Micro Edition (J2ME) application which offers nurses and CHWs the service to record and keep track of women’s and their newborns’ clinic appointments. The server holds the information about patients’ visits and keeps track of their recommended treatments, to remind them over the “Mobile Midwife” application about their forthcoming or overdue appointments.    The CHWs are also informed, so they could follow up with the patient. At the same time, the application can generate multiple monthly reports providing information about women due to deliver soon, and details about individual women’s pregnancy state [31] . The Malaria Consortium, a non-profit organization specializing in extensive supervision of malaria and other infectious diseases, especially among children in Africa and Southeast Asia, developed the inSCALE (Innovations at Scale for Community Access and Lasting Effects) project [33] . Their project is intended to support effective service delivery for CHWs in Mozambique and Uganda. The focus is on people suffering from diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and other diseases. The project’s goal was coverage of appropriate treatments for all children in need through mHealth technologies, which served as a medium for proper motivation, supervision, information-source, and training of CHWs. These CHWs are trained to treat the most common illnesses in the surrounding communities to increase community awareness and motivate members to orient themselves towards the public interest. “Take care your heart” is a mHealth application that is focusing on chronic heart diseases. It is developed to monitor medication and activities related to heart diseases such as rehabilitation, physical activity, blood pressure, etc. “Take care your heart” is educating patients with heart diseases on how to improve their quality of life and helping them to manage their disease [36] . Another solution is called iMHere [37] , which is a system that supports self-management and personalized care for individuals with spina bifida, a permanently disabling birth defect. For these patients, self-management consists of numerous tasks including regular visual inspections of one’s skin as a preventative measure. iMHere supports people in the form of regular follow-up care, self-management and secure two-way communication between patients and clinicians. In [38]  a mobile phone-based communication system aiming at monitoring pregnancy was developed and evaluated. Through their developed SMS-based system interactive communication between CHWs, mother-infant pairs, a national centralized database, the health facility and the ambulance driver, was established. During their pilot phase, 11,502 pregnancies were monitored and 362 SMS alerts for urgent/life-threatening events were registered. A Feasibility Study of a smartphone application for detecting skin cancers in people with albinism was conducted in [39] . Their study done with 69 people showed, that a smartphone application, which was called NgoziYangu, can be used to aid in the detection of skin cancers due to skin lesions among people with albinism. Within the application, it was possible to upload and take pictures including the possibility to enter additional data like date of birth. These pictures were then transferred to professionals who could analyze them to find abnormalities. Another mHealth solution [40]  delivers a reminder system with open-source Rapid SMS software to remind parents of the vaccinations of their children. They also used a cash-sending system and delivered around 2 USD for each successful vaccination as well. They concluded that mobile phone-based strategies are a potentially useful platform to deliver reminders and cash transfers but further studies are needed in that domain as well. In [41]  the “African teledermatology project” was looked into, which is an effort to utilize store-and-forward teledermatology technology to connect various medical institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa to medical specialists in different places around the world to support diagnosis and management of patients with skin diseases, links to educational resources, and access to a dermatologic curriculum. Within their analysis, they found that between two years 345 consultations were done for different diseases, and the project also delivered educational material fitting those cases. In [42]  a mHealth application was developed and evaluated to capture patients’ tuberculosis investigation data, provide results and monitor treatment initiation. The goal of the application was to reduce the time/effort for data reporting, provide fast and automatic access to test results and empower patients (results via cell phone messaging). The results of their research indicated that the mHealth application was feasible, was accepted by participating stakeholders, and has the potential to reduce the time to tuberculosis treatment. iThemba Life, a mobile health app designed to promote engagement with HIV care through access to medical results was looked into in [43] . This solution links a barcode generated after phlebotomy to the installed app and user. Participants received notifications of the results (availability), to view them, as well as their explanations and recommended actions. Although there was a limitation in smartphone access for some participants it was shown, that notification speeds were increased and the users wanted to continue to use the app. As seen in these examples, there are different mHealth solutions present in Sub-Saharan Africa and all around the world, but none of these are focusing on the needs of PWA. Therefore the main goal of this work is to deliver a low-fidelity prototype of a mHealth application to support the education of PWA about all aspects of their condition, break myths associated with it, raise awareness about the importance of appropriate protection, build their resilience, self-confidence, and coping skills, to empower them. This topic and goal were not found in any other previous research and is a novel combination of a mHealth solution for this specific target group.  3 Methods The used methodology was based on a user-centered design (UCD) approach (see [44]  for a detailed description) in combination with the Software Requirement Engineering process (SRE) proposed by Laplante in [45] . He accentuates the importance of properly understanding requirements as a specification of ways to accomplish goals proposed by a system. Since impairment of seeing is an issue for most PWA, guidelines of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) [46]  were also used to design the low-fidelity prototype. One of the authors, Amina Hasimbegovic, conducted an on-site observation, which included brainstorming and discussion about the initial idea, which originated by her. It took place in January 2018 in Moshi, Tanzania, where the occurrences of smartphones among PWA, and the environment in which they work and live were examined. A meeting with three PWA took place, with whom open interviews were conducted, where they showed high enthusiasm about the potential application. Afterwards, literature research was conducted to find similar solutions and to verify if this initial idea was valid for further in-depth research afterwards. Within the later on SRE process the following steps based on [45]  were conducted: • Product Mission Statement: definition of the mission  • Goal-Based Approach: find underlying sub-goals, the key questions to help achieve them, and the metrics which aid in determining if these goals are being met. During this process, the main high-level software requirements emerged, based on which more detailed-oriented requirements were established.  • Domain Analysis: analysis of similar applications and projects with nothing similar has been conducted. This resulted in finding no specific application, which is similar to the authors’ proposed solution.  • Questionnaire: A questionnaire should provide feedback from people who actively work with PWA. In total six people took part in this process whose answers provided the detailed requirements.  • SRS (System Requirement Specification) Document: obtained requirements are specified in the SRS Document in natural language, to be understood by users and stakeholders who do not have any technical knowledge and skills.  • Prototype: the low-fidelity prototype was conceptualized based on requirements. After having obtained the requirements in a more detailed form, the prototype was designed. Here the WAI guidelines, to meet the needs of the end-users in the most appropriate way, were also included.  • Use Cases: design of the low-fidelity prototype allowed to define the flow of the application, which has been represented by the two most important use cases of the application which were identified  • Requirement validation: meetings with two questionnaire participants in person to discuss the findings were done    In the end, a low-fidelity prototype was developed, which contained 38 identified requirements. These overall results were analyzed, then discussed and concluded. The whole methodological approach can be seen in Fig. 1 . Following chapters align these different steps in chronological order.    4 Results The results are presented in this chapter, which is structured based on the SRE process (see Section 3 ). Each sub-chapter gives an overview of the main results within the defined area. For the purpose and the scope of this paper, some steps were described together within one chapter. 4.1 Mission statement and goals The overall mission statement was defined as “breaking myths associated with albinism and empowering PWA in Sub-Saharan Africa”. This should also be seen in the context of SDGs, which are a baseline for this research and the developed mission statement. Therefore education about albinism should be spread by any means to break myths and debunk attitudes. Additionally, the empowerment of PWA in Sub-Saharan Africa is also very important in this context, which was inspired by the mostly horrifying current conditions they live in. Based on this mission statement the main question to answer is “what are the requirements for a mHealth solution to support PWA in Sub-Saharan Africa”.  4.2 Domain analysis As already stated in related work, there were no similar solutions found by the authors. Therefore, other mHealth solutions in a similar context were looked at in more detail. Included in this analysis was to look for effective ways for knowledge transfer, build resilience, raise one’s self-esteem, and promote good health and well-being (e.g. through video or text, etc.).  4.3 Questionnaire In total, six persons, who actively work with and support PWA in Sub-Saharan Africa, took part by completing the questionnaire. The objective of the questionnaire was to gain further information and requirements regarding the goals. Questions asked were “About which topics should persons with albinism be educated”, or “Should the application use gamification elements to encourage users to use the application and to increase learning engagement”. In total 16 questions were asked. In general, the feedback was good and showed that gamification elements like quizzes would be a good idea to promote knowledge. See Table 1  for an overview of participants.    4.4 SRS and requirements By taking the before-mentioned results into account requirements were identified and an SRS document was developed containing a complete specification of the functionality of software with an exhaustive list of requirements. It also includes all specifications related to external interfaces, performance, attributes, and design constraints [47] . Overall 38 requirements with additional sub-requirements were identified. Due to space constraints, only the main requirements are listed and described in Table 2 .    4.5 Prototype and use cases Based on the identified requirements a low-fidelity prototype was developed. The prototype was using concepts of the Octalysis Framework [48]  to incorporate gamification elements. The basic concept of the application is the representation of different cards, these can also be seen as levels. The cards are connected with arrows representing a path that the user will take. Every card represents a daily lecture with a defined goal, by successfully finishing today’s level and reaching that goal the user collects achievements. Only the lecture of the current day is unlocked (represented by a lock icon) and should be done by the user. A progress bar at the top of the screen shows the current progress, within the path. Every card indicates which topic is being dealt with and the possible number of obtainable stars, which can be earned if all tasks are completed. The stars are one type of achievement, the others are listed in the following: • Yellow stars: represent the number of accomplishments (for every finished lecture, quiz or challenge one star is received),  • White flowers: represent the progress in the daily goal (allowing the user to partially process the daily goal),  • Red hearts: represent special points (obtained by answering correctly three, five, or ten quiz questions in a row, etc.).     A lecture is defined as a lecture flow containing multiple cards, that present information to the user in various media types. When the user starts a lecture a bar at the top of the screen shows the current progress. A lecture flow is shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2(a)  shows a card that presents an educational text to the user, 2(b)  shows a card with a video, and after completing the lecture, the user receives a star and is prompted to proceed to the quiz, see Fig. 2(c) . Similarly to a lecture, a quiz is represented as cards, with a progress bar at the top of the screen, see Fig. 4 . Every card represents one question, see Fig. 4(a) . The quiz contains questions based on the knowledge which was obtained in the previous lecture. When the user gives the correct answer to a certain number of questions in a row, a red heart achievement is unlocked, which can be seen in Fig. 4(b) . After completing the quiz the user is rewarded with a star, as seen in Fig. 4(c) . Afterwards, the user can complete another challenge (seen Fig. 3  for an example) and, receive further rewards. If the user does not want to do another quiz tomorrow’s goal and lecture stay locked. To unlock tomorrow’s lecture the user needs to complete all challenges before.  Fig. 5  shows the home screen before and after completing today’s lecture. At the beginning of the day, today’s goal is still undone and tomorrow’s goal is locked, as seen in Fig. 5(a) . When the user finishes today’s goals the accomplishments are visibly shown to the user as seen in Fig. 5(c) .  Due to the visual impairment of the target group-specific requirements were considered to increase the accessibility of the application. This is crucial according to the WAI and requirements as seen in Table 2 . The considered measures are described in the following. • Every card that contains text has the option to configure text size (top right corner, left icon); as seen in Figs. 4(a) and 2(a) .  • The users have access to alternative content such as video or audio (top right corner, middle and right icon); as seen in Figs. 4(a), 2(b) and 2(a) .  • Another important aspect of the mock-up design was color contrast (greater than 7). Hence, the colors used in this design fulfill this goal.     Also, some more technical aspects should be addressed in the author’s opinion. The application should be flexible and therefore we propose a login screen (see Fig. 6(a) ), which might also be necessary when a CHW uses the mobile phone for different people (i.e. when a PWA does not have a phone) and the possibility to adapt questions as well. Another aspect might be the possibility of only showing questions associated with e.g. age or gender-specific ones. In the author’s opinion, not all questions have the same relevance for each PWA. See Fig. 6(b)  for an overview of all available questions and Fig. 6(c)  for a possible screen to create or enter new questions (e.g. sent out from a central point and entered by the CHW if there is no internet available). These aspects, due to their technical nature, were not part of the following evaluation and should be given additional attention in future work. In terms of specific questions for the application there are already some indications of what people with albinism are often asking — therefore answers to these questions should be included here as well. In [49]  the perspective of 138 children with albinism and their needs are researched on. They also collected specific questions like “Is there a cure for albinism?”, “Are there any books about albinos?” or “Will I become blind?”, which are often asked. Overall they classified their found questions in: information on albinism, marriage/children, eye problems, skin problems, future careers and social topics.    4.6 Evaluation Requirements validation has been performed in a feedback round with the two stakeholders, who also took part in the questionnaire (respondents with ID 1 and 2). The main focus was to determine if the software would meet the end-user’s needs, and the two stakeholders, from which the feedback was obtained, were well suitable for reaching this goal since they had both worked closely with PWA in Sub-Saharan Africa for more than fifteen years. The concept, based on the requirements was presented and discussed (except for technical constraints like login and editing questions). They expressed that the concept was on the right track and that it addresses the end-user’s needs properly. The most welcomed elements of the low-fidelity prototype design were the amount of information the application shows to the user at a time, which was also expressed in the questionnaire. Especially the option for content size configuration and alternative content, the high contrast of colors (whereby it was suggested to replace the yellow star with another color, whose contrast with the white background is higher or to use another background color) and the encouragement of the end-users through awards were well accepted by the two participants. The idea of potential concrete, actual awards was also well accepted, since it may be feasible with the support of many non-governmental organizations active in that area that supply i.a. PWA with necessary sun-protection equipment. The psychological aspect of the application was also very well accepted, stating that further research and on-site observation should be conducted, to find the most suitable approaches for the relevant population, since, according to the stakeholders’ experience, different religious beliefs and practices are far-reaching among PWA in Sub-Saharan Africa. Having this in mind it was stated that positive psychology practices and techniques should be carefully chosen, so that they are universal, in order not to experience refusal and unwanted lower engagement of the end-users. Undoubtedly, the stakeholder feedback was overall very approving, concerning mostly the concept and design of the application. Nevertheless, for potential future work, it was mentioned to enhance the content of the application (e.g. questions).   5 Discussion The suggested application provides PWA with knowledge about their condition, helps to raise public awareness and therefore lowers social stigma. These aspirations have the potential to return the dignity of PWA in Sub-Saharan Africa, build their sense of belonging, and consequently follow the idea of SGD. One of the main drawbacks is the low number of participating experts. But the participating people with their insight and knowledge seemed to be enough to deliver initial input for the here presented gamified mobile solution supporting PWA. Another aspect, which was also mentioned during the evaluation was the current lack of content. The developed low-fidelity prototype only involved a few questions to demonstrate the implementation of the identified requirements. Further specific questions should be flexible to be integrated into a PWA supporting application. Some aspects were not considered, which also might have an impact on the usage of the application, like connectivity/internet or the size of the mobile device. These factors should also be further evaluated and integrated into a final application. The proposed concept of a mHealth application, aiming to support PWA, specifically adapted to their needs, and including gamification elements is a novel approach towards supporting the SDGs. During the research, no similar solution was found supporting and educating PWA. Therefore the here presented research could be considered a starting point for further research in that area.  6 Conclusions and future work The presented low-fidelity prototype included a basic set of lectures and quizzes. In order to be able to support PWA, the content of the application needs to be elaborated. Therefore the next step would be to research more content and specify lectures and quizzes, as well as their order and quantity. In the author’s opinion, the main challenges should not be seen in the definition of them but rather in the distribution and also gamification aspects. PAW might be able to have mobile devices by themselves therefore such a solution should also be made available e.g. for CHWs to hand them out or even do it with them. Challenges not addressed here could be also related to trust in the possibility do such quizzes on a regular basis. It would probably also be a good strategy that such a solution is completely available locally on the device. Further gamification elements could also be included, like (anonymous) highscores, e.g. on a community level. These aspects were not looked into but are considered relevant by the authors. In the author’s opinion, it should also be possible to deliver the option to easily edit or add questions, which was not explicitly discussed with the participants but should be included due to technical and scaling possibilities as well. Another important aspect is to transfer the low-fidelity prototype into a fully productive prototype, which would enable testing and evaluating the application in a real setting with different on-site case studies, which is considered to be done in the next step. This would enable a usability evaluation and further requirements analysis also take general considerations into focus (e.g. internet, available smartphones). This would also enable an evaluation regarding the usage of the application as well as the ability to support the initial goal: raise awareness about the importance of appropriate protection and build resilience, self-confidence, and coping skills, to empower PWA.   Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.  Acknowledgments We would like to thank everybody who helped to develop the low-fidelity prototype especially all participants throughout the different iterations. Without their help, time and ideas this research and the prototype would not have been possible.
