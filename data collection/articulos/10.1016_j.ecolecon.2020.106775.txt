                  Since the adoption of the United Nation's 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, attempts to monitor their status of achievement are increasing by governments, the academic community and non-governmental actors. Particular focus is thereby put on constructing composite indices that allow benchmarking of countries according to their level of SDG achievement. Throughout the different rankings that exist, countries from northern Europe appear to be most advanced regarding SDG implementation. However, this picture is biased as these rankings typically refer to the relative position of countries in relation to all other countries included in the index at a certain point in time. Tracking countries' absolute progress over time towards the SDGs on the basis of such indices can therefore be misleading. The present paper proposes a new progress measure based on the Eurostat method for measuring progress towards the SDGs over time. Applying this measure to the EU Member States on the basis of the official EU SDG indicator set, we show that countries labelled as “SD leaders” hardly make further progress towards the SDGs, while strong movement towards the goals is visible in southern and eastern European countries that score rather low in existing indices. This new perspective suggests that to actually monitor progress towards achieving the SDGs, existing SDG indices should be complemented with a longitudinal perspective to assess development over time towards or away from the 2030 Agenda's objectives.

Since the adoption of the United Nation's 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, attempts to monitor their status of achievement are increasing by governments, the academic community and non-governmental actors. Particular focus is thereby put on constructing composite indices that allow benchmarking of countries according to their level of SDG achievement. Throughout the different rankings that exist, countries from northern Europe appear to be most advanced regarding SDG implementation. However, this picture is biased as these rankings typically refer to the relative position of countries in relation to all other countries included in the index at a certain point in time. Tracking countries' absolute progress over time towards the SDGs on the basis of such indices can therefore be misleading. The present paper proposes a new progress measure based on the Eurostat method for measuring progress towards the SDGs over time. Applying this measure to the EU Member States on the basis of the official EU SDG indicator set, we show that countries labelled as “SD leaders” hardly make further progress towards the SDGs, while strong movement towards the goals is visible in southern and eastern European countries that score rather low in existing indices. This new perspective suggests that to actually monitor progress towards achieving the SDGs, existing SDG indices should be complemented with a longitudinal perspective to assess development over time towards or away from the 2030 Agenda's objectives.   Keywords Sustainable development goals  Sustainability indicators  Composite index  Measuring progress  European Union  Ranking    1 Introduction Monitoring progress towards sustainable development (SD) has long been on the agenda of both statisticians and researchers (Bell and Morse, 2013 ; Bell and Morse, 2018 ; Costanza et al., 2016 ; Parris and Kates, 2003 ; Pintér et al., 2012 ). While national statistical offices have mainly been concerned with developing comprehensive indicator sets to monitor the implementation of SD policy strategies (Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ), researchers in both academia and non-governmental organizations have created composite indices of SD that allow benchmarking of countries as regards their level of SD achievement (Diaz-Sarachaga et al., 2018 ; Fukuda-Parr and McNeill, 2019 ; Singh et al., 2012 ). The adoption of the United Nation's 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015 ) has further spurred the work of both groups (Janoušková et al., 2018 ; Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ). Statistical offices, such as the UN Statistical Commission or Eurostat, have developed official SDG indicator sets (Eurostat, 2017, 2019a ; UN, 2017 ), whereas researchers and non-governmental organizations have created SDG indices and dashboards to rank countries according to their level of achieving the 2030 Agenda's goals and targets (Campagnolo et al., 2018 ; Guijarro and Poyatos, 2018 ; Muff et al., 2017 ; OECD, 2019a ; Sachs et al., 2019 ). Throughout these rankings, European Union (EU) Member States and other OECD countries tend to come out on the top. Within the EU, the highest levels of SDG achievement are usually found in the Scandinavian countries, while southern and eastern Member States appear at the bottom of the spectrum (Campagnolo et al., 2018 ; Guijarro and Poyatos, 2018 ; Muff et al., 2017 ; Sachs et al., 2019 ). This distribution of countries in terms of SDG achievement confirms country rankings of earlier SD-related studies, such as on achieving the Europe 2020 strategy on smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (Çolak and Ege, 2011 ; Fura et al., 2017 ; Pasimeni, 2013 ). The homogeneity of results can be explained by overlaps in the indicators monitored, and by the similarity of methods applied: many studies calculate composite SD indices by indexing and aggregating country figures based on most recent data. However, while such composite indices measure the relative performance of countries in relation to all countries included in the data at one specific point in time (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ), they do – due to the way they are constructed – usually not provide an indication whether countries have actually moved towards or away from SD over time, and at which pace such developments have occurred. Scholars thus increasingly recognize the importance of monitoring trends over time (Bolcarova and Kolosta, 2015 ; Garnasjordet et al., 2012 ; Muff et al., 2017 ; Pintér et al., 2012 ; Rickels et al., 2019 ). The present study proposes a new measure for assessing progress towards sustainable development over time based on a method developed by Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, for its SD monitoring reports (Eurostat, 2018 ). This method, which is mainly based on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR), allows assessing development over time also in the absence of quantified policy targets (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ). By applying this approach to the EU SDG indicator set (Eurostat, 2019a ), we aim to investigate how fast EU Member States have been moving towards (or away from) the SDGs over time, and which SDGs have seen the most or least progress. We also contrast our results with those of existing reports, to assess whether countries usually labelled as “SD leaders” are also the ones that progress fastest towards the SDGs. Consequently, the research questions the present study attempts to answer are: (1) Which EU countries have moved fastest towards the SDGs, and which have lagged behind? (2) Are the countries that lead existing SDG rankings also those that move quickest towards the goals? (3) More generally, is there a relationship between a country's level of SDG achievement and the rate of (further) progress towards the goals? The findings of our study are relevant for both researchers and policy makers. For scholars working on SD indices, our study offers an alternative method that might complement existing monitoring and benchmarking approaches that focus on the status quo only. In addition, our study can provide SD policy makers with an indication of whether past decisions have resulted in a move towards or away from SD policy objectives. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews existing SD benchmarking approaches of European countries. In Section 3, we introduce our methodological approach and the dataset used. Section 4 presents and contrasts the calculated SD country rankings, and Section 5 discusses the results in light of existing literature. Section 6 finally draws conclusions as regards the usefulness of the proposed progress measure.  2 Review of existing SD benchmarking approaches Since the appearance of the first SD indicator sets in the 1990s, numerous studies and reports attempted to measure sustainable development and indicate which countries or regions have achieved the highest levels of sustainability (Parris and Kates, 2003 ; Phillis et al., 2011 ; Singh et al., 2012 ). The adoption of policy strategies aimed at advancing sustainable development at national, European and international levels, such as the Europe 2020 strategy or the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs, in combination with indicator sets to monitor the respective policies, spurred the process (Hák et al., 2016 ; Janoušková et al., 2018 ; Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ). Most EU countries have developed indicator sets, ranging from just a few headline indicators to rather comprehensive sets with more than 200 indicators, to monitor their national SD strategies (Steurer et al., 2010 ; Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ). While such large indicator sets intend to offer a sufficient level of detail for sectoral policy making (Schoenaker et al., 2015 ), it is usually difficult to draw a clear-cut picture as regards the state of, or the progress towards, sustainable development on their basis (Guijarro and Poyatos, 2018 ; Janoušková et al., 2018 ; Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ). Many – mostly non-governmental – actors and scholars have therefore developed composite indices (CIs) that aggregate the plethora of available data into a single number that can be compared across countries or regions (Morse, 2016 ; Parris and Kates, 2003 ; Singh et al., 2012 ). Despite the variety of views on the aggregation of indicators into indices and on whether such indices are well suited to measure a multidimensional complex phenomenon such as sustainable development (Bell and Morse, 2018 ), there is consensus that CIs are easier to communicate to the public (Becker et al., 2017 ; Böhringer and Jochem, 2007 ; Janoušková et al., 2018 ; Lehtonen et al., 2016 ; OECD, 2008 ). Consequently, the purpose of such CIs usually is to raise (public) awareness, for example by benchmarking countries against each other, thereby influencing SD policy making on a rather general than sectoral level (Becker et al., 2017 ; Guijarro and Poyatos, 2018 ; Lehtonen et al., 2016 ; Morse, 2015 ). Due to the availability of comparable data across countries through the European Statistical System (ESS) and the existence of shared targets, such as through the EU Sustainable Development Strategy or the Europe 2020 strategy, the EU and its Member States have been prominent objects of such benchmarking exercises based on CIs. Table 1   lists recent studies that constructed CIs for comparing the performance of EU countries in relation to sustainable development. Since the adoption of the UN 2030 Agenda (UN, 2015 ) and a respective global indicator set (UN, 2017 ), benchmarking exercises concerning countries' SDG performance have usually broadened their focus to cover as many countries in the world as possible. Among those, the SDG Index developed by the Bertelsmann Foundation in cooperation with the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) (Sachs et al., 2019 ) and the OECD's distance measure (OECD, 2019a ) are considered to be the most prominent methods to measure SDG performance at national level (Janoušková et al., 2018 ; Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ). Table 1  therefore also includes studies on SDG performance that do not only focus on the EU but that include EU countries in their country rankings. Most of the studies listed in Table 1  construct a CI based on methods Miola and Schiltz (2019)  refer to as “simple mean” or “distance measure”. Both methods apply normalization and aggregation techniques that result in indices measuring the relative performance of countries in relation to all countries included in the assessment. In the case of the SDGs, the distance measure is more challenging from a methodological point of view, as it requires quantitative target values for each indicator and country. As most of the SDG targets are not defined in quantitative terms (Hák et al., 2016 ; Janoušková et al., 2018 ; Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ), studies based on the distance measure also take into account scientifically defined thresholds or the average values of the top performing countries to define “ideal” target values for all indicators (OECD, 2019a ; Sachs et al., 2019 ). However, as these “ideal” target values do not represent politically agreed objectives, they can be considered the most critical and debatable elements in such distance measure approaches (Muff et al., 2018 ). Despite their different methods and data sources, the results of the studies listed in Table 1  are quite homogenous: within the EU, the Nordic countries – Denmark, Finland and Sweden – together with the Netherlands and Austria are usually on top of SD-related country rankings. Southern and eastern European countries, in particular Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, are usually found at the bottom of these rankings. Some studies apply a grouping of countries according to their levels of SD achievement, distinguishing between SD “leaders”, “followers”, etc. (Bolcarova and Kolosta, 2015 ; Fura et al., 2017 ; Grzebyk and Stec, 2015 ; Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2014 ). These country clusters fit well to the idea of different socio-economic – or welfare – models prevailing in Europe (Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ), with countries resembling the ‘Scandinavian’ welfare model showing the highest levels of SD achievement across the EU (Janković Šoja et al., 2016 ). Welfare state models are concerned with different ways of integrating economic and social policies (Vos, 2005 ) and are therefore likely to also shape SD policy making (Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ). The way SD governance arrangements are set up in different countries – including elements such as political leadership, horizontal and vertical policy coordination, stakeholder participation, and monitoring and review mechanisms (Niestroy et al., 2019 ; Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ; Volkery et al., 2006 ) – might thus influence the levels of SD achievement as well as the progress observed across countries towards reaching the SDGs (Volkery et al., 2006 ). While it would go beyond the scope of this paper to conduct an in-depth review of SD governance arrangements across EU Member States (see Niestroy et al., 2019  for a recent review of the governance frameworks put in place for SDG implementation across the EU), we retain the idea of different welfare state models in the EU as potential explanatory factor in our study (Janković Šoja et al., 2016 ; Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ). All of the studies listed in Table 1  compute the country rankings based on data for a certain point in time, usually the most recent year for which data are available. Some of them calculate rankings for several years (Bolcarova and Kolosta, 2015 ; Campagnolo et al., 2018 ; Çolak and Ege, 2011 ; Fura et al., 2017 ; Grzebyk and Stec, 2015 ; Pasimeni, 2013 ; Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2014 ) or publish regular updates, as is the case for the Bertelsmann/SDSN (Kroll, 2015 ; Sachs et al., 2016, 2017 ; Sachs et al., 2018, 2019 ) and OECD (2018, 2019a)  reports. As Table 1  indicates, the country rankings in terms of SD performance have remained remarkably stable over time, showing only few changes in the relative positions of the (top and bottom) EU Member States since 2011. This longitudinal consistency leaves room for several possible – contrasting – interpretations: (i) all countries have progressed towards SD at about equal pace; (ii) all countries have more or less stagnated at their current level of SD achievement; (iii) all countries have moved away from SD objectives at about equal pace; (iv) the countries at the bottom have seen stronger progress than those on the top, but the gap between these two groups is so big that the relative positions have not changed; or (v) the countries on the top have seen stronger progress than those at the bottom, and the gap between the two groups has therefore widened. It is obvious that the inability of most of the existing CIs to resolve these different interpretations is unsatisfactory, especially in light of the 2030 Agenda's (UN, 2015 ) call for measuring the progress  made in implementing the SDGs. Scholars thus increasingly recognize the importance of monitoring trends over time to help evaluate the effectiveness of SD policy implementation (Bolcarova and Kolosta, 2015 ; Garnasjordet et al., 2012 ; Muff et al., 2017 ; Rickels et al., 2019 ). The adoption of an appropriate time horizon for assessing progress towards SD, combined with repeated measurements, are thus also important elements of the Bellagio STAMP principles for measuring SD (Pintér et al., 2012 ). For the purpose of this study, we therefore turn our focus to a method that has not received much attention in academic literature so far, despite it is considered to be one of the three most prominent methods to measure SDG performance alongside the Bertelsmann/SDSN and OECD reports (Janoušková et al., 2018 ; Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ): the Eurostat approach for monitoring progress towards the SDGs at EU level (Eurostat, 2018 ). In contrast to the methods listed in Table 1 , Eurostat applies a “progress measure” (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ) that is based on calculating the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of an indicator trend between two points in time. In the presence of a quantified political target, the actual CAGR of an indicator is compared to the theoretical CAGR that would be needed to achieve the target. In the absence of such targets, the trend is compared with the desired direction from an SD point of view (Eurostat, 2014, 2018 ). While Eurostat has so far employed this method only at the EU-level, to calculate aggregate progress scores per SDG for the EU as a whole (Eurostat, 2018 ), the purpose of our study is to apply this method at the level of the 28 EU Member States. Our aim is to contrast and complement existing country rankings on SDG performance with a longitudinal analysis of progress in relation to the 17 goals, in view of resolving the different interpretations arising from the homogeneity of existing country rankings (Rickels et al., 2019 ).  3 Data source and methods 3.1 Data source The study is based on the EU SDG indicator set that was developed in 2017 by Eurostat for the purpose of monitoring progress towards the SDGs in an EU context. This set can be assumed to be the most appropriate data source when assessing progress towards the SDGs across EU Member States (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ). The version of the indicator set used in this study stems from January 2019 (Eurostat, 2019a ) and comprises 99 indicators, structured according to the 17 SDGs. Each SDG is monitored through five to six main indicators (allocated to this goal) plus additional multi-purpose indicators (allocated to other goals, but used multi-purposely to monitor more than one goal). Consequently, the total number of indicators used in this study differed from goal to goal, ranging from 5 indicators for SDG 17 ‘Partnerships for the goals’ to 11 indicators for SDG 3 ‘Good health and well-being’. Multi-purpose indicators were only counted once when calculating aggregated figures. Reflecting the 15-year scope of the 2030 Agenda (from 2015 to 2030), the aim of our study was to cover country data from the past 15 years for all indicators (with most recent data usually referring to 2017 or 2018). However, depending on the data collection and the country in question, many time series were actually shorter; for example, data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) are usually only available from 2005 onwards, resulting in a 12-year time series (with 2017 data being the most recent for most countries). The data for the 99 indicators used in this study were extracted in December 2018 and January 2019 from the Eurostat website (Eurostat, 2019b ).  3.2 Methods Our study applied two calculation methods on the Eurostat SDG data set: (1) calculating change over time by means of the compound annual growth rate (CAGR), hereinafter referred to as progress measure , and (2) calculating status in a certain year as the mean over all indicators, hereinafter referred to as simple mean  (this nomenclature is based on Miola and Schiltz (2019) ). Both the progress measure and the simple mean are thus based on the same data source. 3.2.1 Progress measure Progress measures are used by a number of national statistical offices, including Eurostat, for assessing indicator trends over time in official SD monitoring reports (Eurostat, 2014, 2017, 2018 ), and more recently also in reports from inter- and non-governmental organizations (see for example Sachs et al. (2019) , OECD (2019a)  and UNEP (2019) ). The progress measure applied in this study is based on the method used by Eurostat in its annual SDG monitoring reports (Eurostat, 2018 ). It involves calculating the compound average growth rate (CAGR) between two points in time, followed by non-linear transformation to calculate scores ranging from −5 (worst score, indicating strong unsustainable trends) to +5 (best score, indicating strong sustainable trends), with 0 (zero) meaning no movement in either direction. The CAGR formula is given in eq. (1).(1) CAGR = y t  y t 0     1 t − t 0     − 1    where t0  = base year, t = most recent year, yt0  = indicator value in base year, yt  = indicator value in most recent year. The CAGR approach has the benefit of providing results in %-change per year that can be compared across different time spans (Eurostat, 2014, 2018 ), and it doesn't require the existence of quantified targets for its application (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ); it is sufficient if the desired direction in which an indicator should evolve from an SD point of view is known (which is the case for virtually all EU SDG indicators). Following the approach from Eurostat, we calculated growth rates for two time spans: a long-term trend, referring to the past 15-year period, and a short-term trend, referring to the past 5-year period. This distinction provides information on whether a development has been continuous over the whole time period or whether a recent turnaround in the trend occurred (Eurostat, 2018 ). Due to data availability issues, for a number of countries and indicators only the short-term trends could be calculated. Such issues also include breaks in time series; that is, changes in the methodology for compiling the data for specific countries and indicators. In case such breaks in time series resulted in level shift changes that would cause the calculated growth rate to reflect the change in the methodology rather than the change in the country's situation, the time series was shortened accordingly. In consideration of data availability, long-term trends were calculated when the available time series covered as least 10 consecutive years, and short-term trends for time spans of at least 3 years (Eurostat, 2018 ). A non-linear transformation was then applied to the long- and short-term growth rates, taking into account the desired direction of an indicator from an SD point of view (Campagnolo et al. (2018)  use a similar approach to construct their SDG index). For doing so, the transformation function used by Eurostat was slightly modified. The most important change was to increase the cut-off point for positive (i.e., sustainable) CAGR values from 2% to 6% per year, while the cut-off point for negative (i.e., unsustainable) CAGR values was kept at −2% per year. The resulting transformation function is visualized in Fig. 1  .1  1 See for comparison Figure III.1 in Eurostat 's 2018 SDG monitoring report (Eurostat, 2018 ).   The increase in the cut-off point for positive trends was made due to two reasons. First, one can expect more variation in country-level data than in (aggregated) EU-level data, and some national statistical offices therefore use three times higher thresholds than Eurostat when assessing indicator trends (Eurostat, 2014 ). Second, using equal cut-off points for sustainable and unsustainable trends would mean that during aggregation, unsustainable trends can be compensated by sustainable trends of equal pace. In consideration of the discussions of strong versus weak sustainability (Balaceanu and Apostol, 2014 ; Bell and Morse, 2008 ; Hopwood et al., 2005 ; Mori and Christodoulou, 2012 ; Pearce et al., 1989 ; Rickels et al., 2019 ), literature on constructing composite indices (Greco et al., 2019 ; Munda and Nardo, 2009 ; OECD, 2008 ) therefore calls for using non-compensatory approaches, such as multi-criteria aggregation. However, non-compensatory approaches can be rather complicated to use when the number of variables is high (Munda and Nardo, 2009 ; OECD, 2008 ). Using geometric methods for aggregation instead of arithmetic ones can partly overcome the problem of compensability (Biggeri et al., 2019 ; Sironen et al., 2014 ), but since the geometric mean has some disadvantages in practical use (Biggeri et al., 2019 ; Pasimeni, 2013 ; Sironen et al., 2014 ), we instead decided to use the arithmetic mean in combination with nonlinear transformation for calculating aggregated country scores. The different cut-off points for sustainable and unsustainable trends still allow compensation, but “sanction” unsustainable trends by giving them more weight during aggregation. In a final step, aggregated country scores (for both the long- and the short-term periods) were calculated for each of the 17 SDGs and all SDGs combined. Country scores are, thus, an average of the transformed indicator scores, making it unlikely that any country reaches the maximum/minimum scores of +5/−5. Country scores were only calculated if data were available for more than half of the indicators of the respective SDG. In addition, scores were flagged as having “low reliability” if data were only available for less than two thirds of the indicators, as in that case the respective score may not be representative of the whole SDG.  3.2.2 Simple mean The second method was taken from existing literature on calculating country rankings with aggregated indices (see Table 1 ). It involved normalization of indicator values with a min-max-method:(2)  X ic  = x ic  − min i  x ic    max i  x ic   − min i  x ic        (3)  X ic  = max i  x ic   − x ic   max i  x ic   − min i  x ic .         where X ic   is the normalized value of x ic  , i  is the indicator, c  the country and max i   and min i   are the maximum and minimum values of the indicator across the whole period available for all the countries. Eq. (2) was used when growth in the indicator's value was the desired development (e.g. employment rate), while Eq. (3) was used when a decrease in the indicator's value meant the desired development (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions). The normalized values were subsequently aggregated into indices using the arithmetic mean and equal weighting of indicators, with the resulting index values ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Indices were calculated per country for all SDGs combined, for the most recent year (t) as well as for t-5 years and t-15 years, reflecting the starting years for the short- and long-term CAGR calculations. Due to the fact that country indices are an average of all normalized indicator values, it is unlikely that any country reaches the minimum/maximum index values of 0 or 100. The main intention for calculating SDG indices was not to confirm the country rankings found in existing literature, but to avoid introducing a bias due to differences in the data basis when contrasting the results of both methods (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ).    4 Results To contrast the results of the two methods – progress measure and simple mean – and the different time horizons (t, t-5 years, and t-15 years), we calculated five rankings of EU Member States (see Table 2  ) based on the total SDG scores and indices. Tables for these country rankings are included in Appendix A. We then created scatter plots to visually compare results from the progress measure with those of the simple mean and also computed rank order correlations (Spearman's rho) for all five rankings. Fig. 2   shows the country pattern of plotting P(st) against S(t), and Table 3   shows the Spearman correlation coefficients for all five rankings. Fig. 2  shows a slightly negative (though not significant) relationship of P(st) and S(t), which represent the most up-to-date country rankings for both progress measure and simple mean. It shows Nordic countries – Sweden, Denmark, Finland – and the Netherlands topping the country ranking from the simple mean approach (x-axis in Fig. 2 ; also see Fig. 4 ), meaning that these countries show the highest levels of SDG achievement across the EU in the most recent year for which data were available. However, the results from the progress measure (y-axis in Fig. 2 ; also see Fig. 3  ) indicate that these countries have seen almost no progress towards (or even movement away from) the SDGs over the past 5-year period. Instead, the strongest progress towards the SDGs over this short-term period occurred in eastern and southern European countries with relatively low index values, especially in Croatia, Portugal, Romania and Lithuania (see Fig. 3 ). The rank order correlation coefficients in Table 3  confirm the negative relationship between the country rankings from the progress measure vis-à-vis the simple mean across the different time horizons. This means that countries that top a ranking established with one method (e.g. simple mean) can be found towards the bottom of a ranking computed with the other method (e.g. progress measure) (also see the country ranking tables in Appendix A). However, with all correlation coefficients of the progress measure and the simple mean being around −0.5, our results do not show a simple flip of the country rankings calculated with the two methods. Table 3  also shows that the three country rankings from the simple mean method are highly correlated, indicating that the relative positions of the 28 EU Member States in terms of their levels of SDG achievement have remained rather stable over the past 15 years. Table 3  in addition shows a medium correlation between the two country rankings from the progress measure, meaning that the pace of progress towards the SDGs has seen some variation across countries over time (i.e. some countries' progress towards the SDGs has slowed down, while others have accelerated; also see Fig. 3 ). Applying the progress measure calculations at the level of the 17 SDGs offers a more detailed picture of (un)sustainable trends across EU Member States (see Tables B.1 and B.2  in Appendix B). The best short-term score achieved by a country is 4.12 for Czechia for SDG 1 ‘No poverty’, indicating strong progress towards this goal over the past 5-year period.2  2 Romania and Slovenia actually have a score of 5.00 in SDG 14 ‘Life below water’; however, due to data availability issues, these scores have rather low reliability, as indicated in Table B.1  in Appendix B.   The worst score is shown by Luxembourg for SDG 10 ‘Reduced inequalities’, with −3.52, indicating rather strong unfavourable developments in this area. Around half of the Member States show their best short-term progress in SDG 14 ‘Life below water’, SDG 13 ‘Climate action’ or SDG 1 ‘No poverty’. In contrast, half of the countries show their worst score – indicating quite strong unsustainable trends – in SDG 10 ‘Reduced inequalities’, SDG 2 ‘Zero hunger’ or SDG 17 ‘Partnerships for the goals’. A divergent pattern is visible for the long-term period, with almost half of the Member States showing either their best or their worst progress score in SDG 1. Overall, every EU Member State has seen unsustainable developments towards one or more of the 17 SDGs over the past 5- and 15-year periods. The only exception is Czechia, which has seen purely favourable SDG trends over the long-term period (although not over the short-term period). When analysing progress towards the 17 SDGs from a country perspective, Germany appears to be the most homogeneous country over the short-term period, with low to medium progress towards almost all goals. In contrast, other countries such as Croatia, Malta, Luxembourg and Lithuania show quite heterogeneous developments, with strong progress in some areas and deterioration in others. The picture is quite similar for the long-term period (see Tables B.1 and B.2  in Appendix B). From the perspective of the 17 SDGs, short-term progress appears to be most homogeneous across countries for SDG 7 ‘Affordable and clean energy’, while strong variation in country trends is visible for SDG 1 ‘No poverty’ and SDG 14 ‘Life below water’ (for SDG 14, this variability is also due to data availability issues). Over the long-term period, progress has been most homogeneous across countries for SDG 3 ‘Good health and well-being’, while strong variation is again visible for SDG 1. Due to data availability issues, no long-term scores can be calculated for SDG 14 and SDG 15.  5 Discussion Applying Eurostat's progress measure on a country level yields a quite new and different picture of SDG performance across the EU (see Fig. 3 ) compared with existing country rankings (see Table 1  and Fig. 4  ). While our results based on the EU SDG indicators confirm the position of the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Austria as SD leaders, they also show that the strongest progress towards the SDGs over the past 5- and 15-year periods has been achieved by countries with medium to low SDG index (simple mean) values, mainly from southern and eastern Europe. The country grouping emerging from Fig. 2  fits very well to the idea of different socioeconomic welfare-state models prevailing in Europe (Janković Šoja et al., 2016 ; Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ). Countries resembling the ‘Scandinavian’ welfare state model (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Netherlands) show the highest levels of SDG achievement across the EU, but seem to have stagnated at this level over the past 15 years. Countries resembling the ‘Continental’ (Germany, Austria, Belgium and France) and the ‘Anglo-Saxon’ (UK and Ireland) model show slightly lower SDG index values combined with low to medium progress towards the SDGs over the past few years. Countries characterized by the ‘Transitional’ model – referring to the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 or later – show the lowest SDG scores across the EU, but have partly achieved the fastest progress over time towards the 2030 Agenda's goals. Of particular concern from an SDG perspective seem to be ‘Mediterranean’ countries (Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus and Malta), as they do not only show rather low index values of SDG implementation but also appear to make rather low progress towards the SDGs over time. A possible explanation for this might be that national SD strategies in Mediterranean countries (prior to the SDGs) tended to focus on the environmental dimension only (Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ), thereby neglecting – mainly social – objectives that now constitute important elements of the SDGs. Portugal is a notable exception from this group, showing some of the highest growth rates towards the SDGs across the EU. Overall, we have found slightly negative correlations between the country rankings from the two methods – progress measure and simple mean – applied in this study. While these correlations are significant for S(t-5) and S(t-15), this is not the case for S(t). This can be interpreted in a way that the level of SDG achievement of a country at a certain point in time – at least in part – determines the progress this country is able (or willing) to make over the subsequent years. S(t) would consequently represent the outcome of past progress, and it would only be highly correlated to P(lt) or P(st) if this progress would have been strong enough to overturn the country rankings at S(t-5) and S(t-15). The high correlations between S(t), S(t-5) and S(t-15) show that this has not been the case for the EU countries over the past 15 years. Tables A.1 and A.2  in Appendix A confirm this: out of a maximum score of 5.00, the P(st) and P(lt) values for the top countries are 1.17 and 1.41, respectively, indicating rather slow overall movement towards the SDGs even for the best countries according to the progress measure. In general, whether a country is able to progress towards SD objectives depends on whether there is a possibility for further improvement. It is reasonable to assume that countries that have already reached a high level of SD achievement in most areas (calculated with the simple mean method) will likely only show slow progress due to limited room for further improvement. However, our progress measure calculations for the individual goals (see Tables B.1 and B.2  in Appendix B) reveal that SD leaders such as Sweden, the Netherlands or Denmark show both rather strong positive (sustainable) and negative (unsustainable) trends at the same time. This indicates that further progress towards individual SDGs is possible even for advanced countries, but in their case this seems to be connected with unsustainable trends in other areas. Notably, the countries that have moved fastest towards the SDGs, such as Croatia, Portugal and Romania, show a similar pattern, although in their case a few (but strong) unsustainable developments have been more than offset by a number of other, more positive trends. Consequently, a reason why countries with high levels of SDG achievement do overall not progress further towards the goals might be that they have already exploited most of the synergies that exist between the different SDGs, where progress in one area helps achieve progress in another (Miola et al., 2019 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ). As such, these countries would increasingly face trade-offs between goals, whereby further progress in one area is made at the expense of progress in other areas (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ; O'Neill et al., 2018 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ; Scherer et al., 2018 ; Weitz et al., 2018 ). Overcoming this situation would require turning trade-offs into synergies (Kroll et al., 2019 ). Another possible explanation for the differences in progress towards SD across the EU might be rooted in the countries' political commitment to SD, including the question how the respective governance arrangements are set up. For example, Sachs et al. (2019)  find that political leadership and high-level commitment are crucial for achieving the SDGs. Yet, their assessment of countries in this aspect is in line with other stocktakings of national and European SD governance mechanisms (Niestroy et al., 2019 ; Steurer and Hametner, 2013 ; Volkery et al., 2006 ), which identify weaknesses in ownership of and political commitment to SD strategy processes. While these studies do not assess whether strong SD governance leads to tangible progress (Volkery et al., 2006 ), it is reasonable to assume that a lack of political leadership will make achieving the SDGs more challenging. As such, the differences in SDG progress across the EU (based on our progress measure calculations) likely result from a combination of both the ability to advance in specific SD-related aspects and the political intent to do so. From an SDG perspective, our study shows that across the EU most progress is visible for the social dimension of SD, in particular in the alleviation of poverty (SDG 1) and the promotion of health and well-being (SDG 3). Developments appear less favourable towards the economic and environmental dimensions of SD, especially for the goals related to innovation (SDG 9), inequalities (SDG 10) and ecosystems (SDG 15). It is interesting to note that about one third of the Member States show their least sustainable (or most unsustainable) short-term trends in one of the two SDGs dealing with inequalities, in particular SDG 10. Our progress measure calculations thus confirm the findings of recent studies that have pointed out increasing income inequalities between the rich and the poor as well as increasing regional disparities in terms of income and GDP in Europe (Blanchet et al., 2019 ; Eurostat, 2018 ; OECD, 2019b ).  6 Conclusions The purpose of this study was to assess EU countries' progress towards the SDGs over time, and to contrast the result with existing country rankings on SDG performance. While our calculations confirm that the Nordic EU countries together with the Netherlands and Austria are leaders in SDG implementation across the EU, we also show that most progress towards the SDGs over the past 5- and 15-year periods has been achieved by some southern and eastern European Member States. In a longitudinal perspective, the SD leaders appear to not have progressed any further towards the SDGs, and have partly even moved away from the 2030 Agenda's goals. This indicates that the leading countries may have reached a level of SD implementation – although this level does not necessarily mean fulfilment of the Agenda 2030's ambition – that makes it increasingly difficult for them to take further advantage of win-win situations. Instead, they appear to face more and more trade-offs between different SD objectives, where further progress in one area takes place at the expense of progress in other areas. The differences in the setup of SD governance mechanisms across EU Member States, including political leadership for the 2030 Agenda, might be another factor that influences countries' progress towards the SDGs. The main contribution of the paper to the discussion on monitoring sustainable development and the SDGs consequently is to show that it is not sufficient to calculate indices and country rankings for distinct points in time. Instead, to actually monitor progress  towards the ambition of the 2030 Agenda, it is necessary to also consider development over time, as stipulated by the Bellagio STAMP principles. This paper presents an approach with which such longitudinal assessment can be carried out even in the absence of quantified targets, thereby complementing existing SDG country rankings. Clearly, the approach applied in this paper has the potential for further modification and improvement, which should be in the focus of future research. This includes improvements of the method itself (cut-off points, shape of transformation curve, etc.), the consideration of target values (politically agreed targets, scientifically defined thresholds, etc.), and the testing of approaches to reduce compensability and/or to sanction unsustainable trends (using non-compensatory aggregation approaches, weighting of indicators, etc.). Moreover, further in-depth analyses of unsustainable trends could be carried out, to detect trade-offs and synergies between and within SDGs and whether these have changed over time. Especially the question whether the most developed countries are also the ones that face most trade-offs among the SDGs appears to deserve particular attention. In addition, analysing SDG governance arrangements in relation to our progress measure calculations could yield valuable insights into which governance aspects are most likely to trigger further SD progress. Such analyses would greatly contribute to evidence-based policy making in the area of SDG implementation, helping to ensure that the 2030 Agenda's vision of the future we want (UN, 2012 ) actually turns into the reality we live in by 2030.
