                  Bacterial biofilm is a structured bacterial community enclosed within a three-dimensional polymeric matrix, governed by complex signaling pathways, including two-component systems, quorum sensing, and c-di-GMP, which regulate its development and resistance in challenging environments. The genetic configurations within biofilm empower bacteria to exhibit significant pollutant remediation abilities, offering a promising strategy to tackle diverse ecological challenges and expedite progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Biofilm-based technologies offer advantages such as high treatment efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability compared to conventional methods. They significantly contribute to agricultural improvement, soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration, thereby supporting SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 13 (Climate action), and SDG 15 (Life on land). In addition, biofilm facilitates the degradation of organic-inorganic pollutants from contaminated environments, aligning with SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG 14 (Life below water). Bacterial biofilm also has potential applications in industrial innovation, aligning SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), and SDG 9 (Industry, innovation, and infrastructure). Besides, bacterial biofilm prevents several diseases, aligning with SDG 3 (Good health and well-being). Thus, bacterial biofilm-mediated remediation provides advanced opportunities for addressing environmental issues and progressing toward achieving the SDGs. This review explores the potential of bacterial biofilms in addressing soil pollution, wastewater, air quality improvement, and biodiversity conservation, emphasizing their critical role in promoting sustainable development.

Moreover, increased community engagement in water supply and sanitation initiatives can improve outcomes. In India, nationwide sanitation campaigns such as Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign\u2014NBA), Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission\u2014SBA) are conducted to ensure access to clean water ( Routray et al., 2017 ). Similarly, the RAIN project, supported by the Coca-Cola company, aims to provide safe drinking water to the African population ( Atuluku, 2022 ). Moreover, the Imo State Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Nigeria is a comparable initiative focused on improving water supply for the Nigerian population.   https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-017 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-037 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-012 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-004  item S0301-4797(24)02731-2 S0301479724027312 1-s2.0-S0301479724027312 10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122745 272592 2024-10-20T20:32:35.126179Z 2024-11-01 2024-11-30 1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-main.pdf https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/MAIN/application/pdf/d2ec2acfb2edd09a1b008b52dddf2d4c/main.pdf main.pdf pdf true 5584537 MAIN 24 1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-main_1.png https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/PREVIEW/image/png/a57d8e8c5e1ec486f017f4a7b930a369/main_1.png main_1.png png 59400 849 656 IMAGE-WEB-PDF 1    1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr4.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/gr4/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/8075a41b14d2dd005728bf158674782f/gr4.jpg gr4 gr4.jpg jpg 228155 532 535 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr1.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/gr1/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/dea9cb3b9d8a3186e736c5341c355d9e/gr1.jpg gr1 gr1.jpg jpg 185477 455 535 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr3.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/gr3/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/80320ae795be4eef3596769ae4e0b5c9/gr3.jpg gr3 gr3.jpg jpg 225811 598 691 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr2.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/gr2/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/691e173ef6fa3446f1bdac9b20f4ceae/gr2.jpg gr2 gr2.jpg jpg 163771 305 535 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-ga1.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/ga1/DOWNSAMPLED/image/jpeg/5ad6b52953f665e77c14cf78ffef43cc/ga1.jpg ga1 true ga1.jpg jpg 122031 245 275 IMAGE-DOWNSAMPLED  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr4.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/gr4/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/5a1d3b64d3cc438e4fff52712e60b685/gr4.sml gr4 gr4.sml sml 91170 164 165 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr1.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/gr1/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/e62c9f1e22faa193a7397ce41e027f41/gr1.sml gr1 gr1.sml sml 89854 164 193 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr3.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/gr3/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/22524db0f1017d081ba59f0a5c1da66e/gr3.sml gr3 gr3.sml sml 86218 163 189 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr2.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/gr2/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/a527357101c65c4af54df25b5dd5667b/gr2.sml gr2 gr2.sml sml 88832 125 219 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-ga1.sml https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/ga1/THUMBNAIL/image/gif/b1ec400e417e29da56f8a1beab24ba20/ga1.sml ga1 true ga1.sml sml 85291 164 184 IMAGE-THUMBNAIL  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr4_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/b06308b6201dba5cfd4f5d814bfd6fe2/gr4_lrg.jpg gr4 gr4_lrg.jpg jpg 1122782 2359 2371 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr1_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/c264fd23fa11d48f0e6e5b08c28979b5/gr1_lrg.jpg gr1 gr1_lrg.jpg jpg 821622 2016 2369 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr3_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/e8eaf8112c5e490d76491960ce3df017/gr3_lrg.jpg gr3 gr3_lrg.jpg jpg 1196450 2646 3060 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-gr2_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/0773b36fd919d51d9ed9790a3bb2216e/gr2_lrg.jpg gr2 gr2_lrg.jpg jpg 787947 1353 2370 IMAGE-HIGH-RES  1-s2.0-S0301479724027312-ga1_lrg.jpg https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod-ucs-content-store-eu-west/content/pii:S0301479724027312/HIGHRES/image/jpeg/ccc05ddd41ad0906674ab9aa962e8006/ga1_lrg.jpg ga1 true ga1_lrg.jpg jpg 407422 1085 1219 IMAGE-HIGH-RES     YJEMA 122745 122745 S0301-4797(24)02731-2 10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122745 Elsevier Ltd  Fig. 1 Multifaceted application of the biofilm-forming bacteria in sustainable remediation of different soil types.

The genetic configurations within biofilm empower bacteria to exhibit significant pollutant remediation abilities, offering a promising strategy to tackle diverse ecological challenges and expedite progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Biofilm-based technologies offer advantages such as high treatment efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability compared to conventional methods. They significantly contribute to agricultural improvement, soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration, thereby supporting SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 13 (Climate action), and SDG 15 (Life on land). In addition, biofilm facilitates the degradation of organic-inorganic pollutants from contaminated environments, aligning with SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG 14 (Life below water). Bacterial biofilm also has potential applications in industrial innovation, aligning SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), and SDG 9 (Industry, innovation, and infrastructure). Besides, bacterial biofilm prevents several diseases, aligning with SDG 3 (Good health and well-being). Thus, bacterial biofilm-mediated remediation provides advanced opportunities for addressing environmental issues and progressing toward achieving the SDGs. This review explores the potential of bacterial biofilms  in addressing soil pollution, wastewater, air quality improvement, and biodiversity conservation, emphasizing their critical role in promoting sustainable development.

This biofilm lifestyle offers several advantages to bacteria, including protection from environmental stresses, enhanced nutrient acquisition, and increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. The EPS matrix plays a crucial role in providing structural support and protection to the bacterial community, allowing enhanced attachment to surfaces, particularly in nutrient-rich environments such as air-water interfaces (Mahto et al., 2022a ; Flemming et al., 2023 ). By encasing the bacterial cells, the EPS matrix not only shields them but also facilitates their communication and interaction. The diverse components of EPS, including polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and humic acids, influence the adhesive properties of biofilm (Di Martino, 2018 ). This adhesive nature is crucial for the initial attachment of bacterial cells to surfaces, as it creates a sticky environment that firmly anchors the cells and promotes stable colonization. As a result, the formation of a biofilm progresses through a dynamic and multi-stage process that includes bacterial adhesion, microcolony formation, maturation, and eventual dispersion (You et al., 2023 ). The transition from biofilm formation to dispersion is regulated by multiple factors that operate through specific pathways, ensuring a coordinated response to external stimuli. Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathways are key regulatory mechanisms that modulate the transition between planktonic and biofilm lifestyles in bacteria (Akçelik and Akçelik, 2022 ). However, the exact mechanisms by which cAMP influences biofilm formation are not as well-established as those involving c-di-GMP, making it crucial to understand these pathways for developing strategies to modulate biofilm formation and dispersion. Apart from this, quorum sensing (QS) significantly influences biofilm dynamics by enabling bacterial cells to communicate at a specific density through chemicals called autoinducers (Moreno-Gámez et al., 2017 ). These autoinducers initiate specific gene expressions that control biofilm formation and modulate gene activity in response to cell density. QS also integrates with additional regulatory systems, such as two-component systems (TCS) and alternative sigma factors, to respond to environmental signals and stress (Guła et al., 2019 ). Additionally, QS in bacterial cells also activates processes such as competence, sporulation, and antibiotic production during each phase of the biofilm stage. The biofilm, in turn, possesses unique properties that enable bacteria to adapt to various environmental stresses, including organic matter, heavy metals, microplastic, and other micropollutants, making them more resilient than their free-living planktonic counterparts. This resilience translates into superior remediation capabilities. Bacterial biofilm is crucial in nutrient cycling, pollutant degradation, climate regulation, and pathogenesis and is widely studied for biotechnological applications such as wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and biofilm-based reactors in industry (Solanki et al., 2020 ). Its economic impact is substantial, estimated at over $5 trillion USD annually. While biofilm contributes positively in areas like wastewater treatment ($117 billion), agriculture ($324 billion), renewable energy via anaerobic digestion ($2 billion), and oil spill remediation ($46 billion), the challenge of optimizing its applications persists (Cámara et al., 2022 ). Through degradation or alteration of pollutants, bacterial biofilm reduces their mobility and toxicity, rendering them less harmful to the environment and human health. Rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population growth have led to widespread environmental contamination, impacting soil, water, and air quality. In response, eco-friendly technologies like bioremediation, which utilizes biofilm-forming bacteria, have been developed to promote environmental sustainability. This method is both effective and cost-efficient for large-scale pollutant degradation and detoxification (Yadav and Chandra, 2020 ). Biofilm-mediated bioremediation targets a wide range of contaminants, including xenobiotics, PAHs, heavy metals, and microplastic, converting them into less harmful substances like CO2  and H2 O through diverse catabolic pathways (Lahiri et al., 2022 ). Biofilm-forming bacteria bioremediate industrial wastewater by regulating gene expression and cell signaling in response to population density. This regulatory capability also enables biofilm to play a crucial role in the phytodegradation of organic and inorganic pollutants in water and soil (Kumar and Chandra, 2017 ). Additionally, biofilm plays a crucial role in the biofiltration of harmful air pollutants, significantly aiding in the improvement of air quality (Kraakman et al., 2021 ). Bacterial biofilm-mediated environmental remediation has emerged as a promising approach to address various environmental challenges and accelerate progress toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Bacterial biofilm plays a significant role in enhancing agriculture, improving soil strength, facilitating nutrient cycling, regulating climate change, mitigating soil, water, and air pollution, driving industrial innovation, and preventing harmful diseases, addressing several goals and targets of SDGs (Villanueva et al., 2011 ; Srivastava et al., 2017 ; Solanki et al., 2020 ). The present review summarizes the remediation strategies of the biosphere, including soil, water, and air, highlighting the importance of bacterial biofilm and EPS. The significance of achieving the goals and targets of the United Nations amended SDGs by 2030 has also been elaborated. Besides, bacterial biofilm-mediated research to attain the SDGs has been summarized.  2 Bacterial biofilm: a catalyst for environmental remediation The bacteria within the biofilm, encased in EPS, form a protective barrier that shields them from a range of environmental pollutants. Bacterial biofilm has emerged as valuable bio-eco marker for studying polluted environments due to its distinct properties and responses to contaminants (Adetunji and Anani, 2021 ). The EPS matrix in bacterial biofilm exhibits distinct physical and chemical properties that are crucial for its function. Physically, the EPS matrix is gel-like and viscous due to its high molecular weight and hydrophilic nature, providing mechanical strength and elasticity while maintaining porosity for nutrient and waste exchange (Xiao and Zheng, 2016 ). The chemical composition of the EPS matrix confers hydrophilicity, charge interactions, and biochemical reactivity. These properties enable the EPS matrix to maintain hydration, resist physical stresses, interact with environmental factors, and facilitate biochemical processes within the biofilm. The biofilm surface possesses surface-active groups interacting with contaminants, promoting their adsorption and subsequent degradation (Mangwani et al., 2016a ). Furthermore, EPS and biosurfactants within the biofilm matrix increase the interaction with the surrounding pollutants, facilitating their solubilization and uptake (Markande et al., 2021 ). As a result, the biofilm system acts as a catalyst enabling bacteria to regulate their metabolism and survive under detrimental conditions. Biofilm resists harsh environmental conditions by regulating composition, signaling, and metabolic processes. 2.1 Regulatory mechanisms governing biofilm formation and dissociation Biofilm formation and dissociation are regulated by a complex interplay of mechanisms that enable bacteria to adapt to adverse environmental conditions. Central to these processes are the two regulatory mechanisms, TCS and QS that modulate cellular responses to a range of environmental signals and coordinate population-level behaviors (Ronda and Wang, 2022 ). TCS and QS systems often interact to fine-tune the biofilm response. TCS operates through the transfer of phosphoryl groups between histidine and aspartate-containing domains of sensor histidine kinases and response regulator proteins (Alvarez and Georgellis, 2023 ). QS signals can modulate the activity of TCSs, while TCSs can regulate the production or detection of QS signals, creating a feedback loop that ensures a coordinated response to environmental cues and population density. QS molecules establish a signaling cascade within the biofilm that acts as a biosensor to detect the presence of toxic compounds, thereby protecting the bacterial cell from potential damage (Whiteley et al., 2017 ). Additionally, c-di-GMP acts as a master regulator, coordinating the distinct stages of biofilm development, while the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway, mediated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex, responds to cellular energy status and regulates the expression of biofilm-related genes (Liu et al., 2022 ). c-di-GMP signaling serves as a key switch, where elevated levels encourage biofilm development by enhancing the production of EPS, while lower levels facilitate dispersion and a return to a planktonic state (Zhang et al., 2022a ). The synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP are regulated by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), respectively. The balance between DGCs and PDEs is vital for controlling biofilm dynamics, making c-di-GMP a key signaling molecule in bacterial ecology. Non-coding RNAs also contribute significantly to the regulation of biofilm dynamics, influencing gene expression related to adhesion, maturation, and dispersal (Mitra and Mukhopadhyay, 2016 ). These regulatory mechanisms not only enhance the resilience of biofilm against antimicrobial agents and environmental stressors but also enable bacteria to repair damage and maintain their survival in fluctuating conditions. Understanding these regulatory pathways is essential for developing strategies to control biofilm-associated challenges in clinical and industrial settings.  2.2 Multifaceted role of biofilm in environmental pollution mitigation Biofilm plays a crucial role in environmental pollution mitigation by providing a structured and resilient community of bacteria that can degrade, transform, or immobilize pollutants in soil, water, and air. On the pedosphere, soil bacteria adopt a biofilm lifestyle by adhering to fine soil particles and biotic substrates. The colonization of different soil niches by single-species or multispecies biofilm largely influences the physio-chemical characteristics of the soil (Rossi, 2020 ). Biofilm encapsulates metabolically active bacteria that accelerate the soil biogeochemical cycle by transforming organic matter and mineralization. This dual process enhances nutrient availability and influences soil respiration, ultimately improving the soil health and edaphic environment (Wu et al., 2019 ). Biofilm-forming bacteria in the rhizosphere remain associated with the plant roots, protecting against environmental stressors. For instance, the exopolysaccharides and enzymes synthesized by bacterial biofilm maintained the Na+ /K+  ratio in the soil during salinity stress (Ansari et al., 2019 ). Moreover, the functional groups associated with EPS bound with the Na+  ions, minimizing their influx into plants, thereby improving plant productivity in the hypersaline ecosystem (Haque et al., 2022a ). Thus, biofilm-forming bacteria enhanced the plant stress tolerance by stabilizing soil structure, modulating ion balance, and producing protective exopolysaccharides and enzymes. Moreover, rhizobacteria biofilm-EPS maintains a hydrated microenvironment by enhancing the water-holding capacity of the soil. EPS also promote soil aggregation and nutrient acquisition, improving the vegetation index during hypersaline and drought stress (Arora et al., 2020 ). Additionally, biofilm participates in the remediation of contaminated soil by triggering heavy metal detoxification and organic matter degradation. The exopolysaccharides and proteinaceous components of biofilm-EPS interact with pollutants, facilitating their solubilization, bioavailability, and subsequent remediation (Mahto et al., 2022a ). The degradative ability of bacterial biofilm-EPS is frequently harnessed during wastewater treatment to reduce the influx of complex xenobiotics into large water bodies. Diverse bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria within a biofilm, metabolize the wastewater contaminants using different pathways (Muhammad et al., 2020 ). Application of aerobic and anaerobic degradative pathways in biofilm-based bioreactors has been proven advantageous for treating municipal and industrial wastewater. The oxygen gradient within the bioreactor enables the formation of oxic-anoxic zones in the inner layer of the biofilm, leading to higher nutrient removal (Abdelfattah et al., 2020 ). Biofilm technology effectively reduces the biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and nutrient load of the wastewater, presenting a cost-effective solution to digest heavy loads of organic matter in the wastewater while maintaining a low carbon footprint (Saidulu et al., 2021 ). N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are autoinducers synthesized during QS in many bacteria, including Rhizobium radiobacter , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Burkholderia graminis , which can control a broad range of bacterial characteristics such as antibiotic production, biofilm formation, competence, conjugation, motility, pathogenicity, sporulation, symbiosis, and virulence (Yadav and Chandra, 2020 ; Acet et al., 2021 ). The LuxI/R QS systems, prevalent in most Gram-negative bacteria for AHL production, play a crucial role in regulating the expression of specific traits, many of which contribute to the formation and maintenance of biofilm. AHLs regulate the biofilm morphology within the bioreactor. The formation of homogeneous biofilm, cell motility, biofilm thickness, and depth are among the several aspects regulated by QS molecules, which indirectly impact the wastewater treatment process (Huang et al., 2016 ). In addition, AHL supplementation in bioreactors stimulated electrochemical activity in the biofilm, aiding their unique mass transfer ability (Sun et al., 2023 ). Moreover, biofilm exhibits a versatile ability to biofilter air pollutants by breaking down volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and reducing particulate matter (PM) levels in the environment (Ayilara and Babalola, 2023 ). Gaseous emissions diffusing the biofilm allow pollutants to adsorb on the surface, further degrading into non-toxic residues (Sheoran et al., 2022 ). Although hydrophilic particles are readily adsorbed, the EPS and biosurfactants from biofilm help in the emulsification of hydrophobic air pollutants, ensuring the biofiltration of variable air pollutants (Wu et al., 2018 ; Ghasemi et al., 2020 ). Biofilm plays a crucial role in environmental clean-up by contributing significantly to the preservation of ecosystems and sustainable resource management. Unique properties of biofilm are effectively employed in environmental pollution mitigation by finding their application in wastewater treatment, contaminated air purification, and soil remediation. The current approach of utilizing bacterial biofilm in pollutant remediation aligns with the broader principles of SDGs by using a natural, non-toxic, and renewable resource for environmental benefit. Recent discoveries in molecular biology have greatly advanced the biofilm research, particularly in the context of bioremediation. The integration of omics technologies, such as proteomics and genomics, has deepened the understanding of biofilm composition, structure, and function. A compelling example of this integration is a recent study that delves into the physiological responses and molecular mechanisms behind biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa  LNR1. This study utilized advanced transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to uncover the intricate interactions between euglena and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  LNR1 (Chen et al., 2024 ). Through these analyses, researchers gained insights into how extracellular metabolites produced by euglena (EME) affect gene expression and protein synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa , ultimately enhancing biofilm formation for diesel biodegradation. These insights have paved the way for biofilm engineering with improved bioremediation potential through genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. System biology approaches, including nanotechnology and gene editing, are being employed to enhance biofilm efficacy in the bioremediation of heavy metals, plastics, hydrocarbons, and other pollutants (Chakraborty et al., 2022 ). The advancement of biofilm-mediated bioremediation techniques has significantly benefited from the application of genome editing tools, particularly in engineering Bacillus subtilis  as a chassis organism. This bacterium has been utilized to construct two genetic circuits specifically designed for sensing and adsorbing heavy-metal ions. The engineered biosensor demonstrates the capability to detect three heavy metal ions, lead (Pb2 ⁺) and copper (Cu2 ⁺), within a concentration range of 0.1–75 μM, and mercury (Hg2 ⁺) from 0.01 to 3.5 μM, in situ and in real-time, with high sensitivity (Zhu et al., 2024 ). The biosensor can be tailored to respond to specific pollutants by integrating advanced genetic engineering techniques, thereby providing a powerful tool for environmental management and remediation efforts. However, challenges remain, such as the risk of biofilm-associated contaminant dissemination and the complex regulatory mechanisms governing biofilm behavior, necessitating careful consideration in the application of these technologies.   3 Soil remediation strategies using bacterial biofilm Soil is a dynamic, heterogeneous, well-structured natural environment vital for the sustenance of living organisms, nutrient cycling, and neutralizing detrimental effects of harmful toxic pollutants. In recent times, the surge of industrialization, the emergence of modern agricultural practices, and various anthropogenic practices have led to the degradation of agricultural soil quality (Durdu et al., 2023 ). Many physical and chemical approaches have been proposed for the reclamation of such soils over the years. However, owing to their infeasibility and inefficiency under certain circumstances, a sustainable and environment-friendly strategy was needed to overcome the problem of soil erosion and infertile soil (Hou and Al-Tabbaa, 2014 ). The biological approach that harnesses the biofilm-forming ability of bacteria in remediating soil has received considerable attention globally. Thus, biofilm-forming bacteria have multifaceted applications in the sustainable remediation of different types of soils, including salt-affected soils, arid and semi-arid soils, fly ash polluted lands, and mine lands (Fig. 1  ). The biofilm-forming bacteria exhibit various mechanisms to remediate these different types of soil and promote sustainable soil management approaches (Table 1  ). 3.1 Salt-affected soils Soils possessing elevated levels of dissolved salts or amplified concentrations of sodium ions within the soil matrix are called salt-affected soils (Jesus et al., 2015 ). Based on their salinity and sodicity levels, they are divided into three categories: saline, sodic, and saline-sodic soils (Amini et al., 2016 ; Li et al., 2019 ). Soil salinity is one of the nine major identified threats to soil productivity, as reported in “Status of the World's Soil Resources” (FAO and ITPS, 2015 ). According to the report, around one billion hectares of land have been impoverished globally due to salinity, affecting over 100 countries. Several mitigation strategies have been deployed to combat the dereliction of soil. The biological method has garnered significant global attention as a sustainable strategy to overcome the issue of salinity. Bacterial biofilm is being extensively studied due to its ability to accumulate various organic and inorganic compounds and adaptability to salinity stress. Biofilm-forming halophilic bacteria have been recognized as potential biotic agents for salt-affected soil reclamation due to their capability to produce components like exopolysaccharides, osmolytes, and other compatible solutes like proline, trehalose (Egamberdieva et al., 2019 ), ectoines, glycine, and betaines. These solutes are anticipated to protect the bacteria from salinity stress. The study also highlighted the efficient use of salt-tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (ST-PGPR) to ameliorate arable soil and accelerate crop productivity. ST-PGPR are the groups of salt-tolerant root colonizing bacteria present in the rhizosphere layer of the soil that directly or indirectly enhance plant growth. They facilitate rhizoremediation, in which their association with the root of plants (plant-microbe interaction) restores the soil quality (Shultana et al., 2020 ; Haque et al., 2022a ). The ST-PGPR Citrobacter  sp., isolated from the salt desert of the Rann of Kutch, Gujarat, India, was recently demonstrated to have potential applications in the prevention of soil salinization. This bacterium ameliorated salinity stress (reduced salinity from 4.5 to 2.7 g/L) and promoted the growth of Vigna radiata  (L) by producing EPS and the formation of biofilm (Chakraborty and Mondal, 2024 ). ST-PGPR exhibits various mechanisms that govern the accretion of compatible solutes and alter the Na+ /K+  ratio (Upadhyay et al., 2011 ). ST-PGPR like Halomonas variabilis  (HT1), Planococcus rifietoensis  (RT4), Pseudomonas mendocina,  and Bacillus  sp. are known to produce exopolysaccharides that act as a trapping machinery of Na+ , K+ , and Ca+  ions (Qurashi and Sabri, 2012 ; Fatima and Arora, 2019 ). The negatively charged functional groups of exopolysaccharides bind to the salt cations, thereby facilitating the sequestration of salts and ultimately decreasing the cation concentration in the soil. EPS significantly enhances soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) by exchanging Na+  and retaining nutritive ions like Ca+ , Mg+ , and K+ . Bacterial EPS has the efficiency to bind with the soil particles and consequently form micro and macro aggregates, stabilizing the salt-affected soil. EPS reduces the macropores of the soil due to soil aggregation, and as a result, the fertility of the soil and water retention properties elevate (Banerjee et al., 2019 ; Dar et al., 2021 ). Thus, the susceptibility towards soil degradation and erosion decreases, further supporting plant growth.  3.2 Arid and semi-arid soils Arid and semi-arid regions are best described as dry, low rainfall-receiving areas with high average temperatures. The characteristic features of arid soils include moisture deficiency, scanty soil nutrients, scarce organic matter, poor soil texture, high alkalinity, low water retention capacity, and, subsequently, poor fertility (Ayangbenro and Babalola, 2021 ; Hag Husein et al., 2021 ). Arid and semi-arid regions cover approximately 66.7 million km2 , corresponding to 45.4% of the global area, and support the livelihood of around 2 billion people (Junior et al., 2019 ). These lands are considered non-arable owing to the combined effects of poor soil texture, low fertility, and minimum water-holding capacity; hence, reclamation becomes obligatory. Arid soils can be averted from desertification by adapting bacteria-involved biological strategies. Several studies defined bacterial biofilm-mediated arid soil reclamation as a novel geotechnical application in improving the overall ecological functioning of arid and semi-arid soils. Bioinoculation amends the soil structure, stimulates biological activity, retrogrades desertification, reduces permeability, and enhances soil fertility (Rossi, 2020 ). It is reported that arid soils enriched with various bacteria genera like Bacillus , Acinetobacter , Proteus , Myxococcus , and Oscillatoria  undergo soil stabilization (Dhawi, 2023 ). Bacterial EPS acts as a protective sponge, enabling the organism to withstand environmental adversities (Mevo et al., 2021 ). A study on the effects of EPS produced by Bacillus  spp. on soil showed a higher degree of soil aggregation and improved soil texture upon inoculation. EPS comprise of high molecular weight polymers that attach to the surface of soil particles by van der Waals bonds, hydrogen bonds, and cationic bridges, further facilitating soil particle amalgamation (Vardharajula, 2014 ). The formation of microaggregates and macroaggregates leads to increased soil compactness, enhancing its water-holding potential. This improved structure of soil boosts the accessibility of nutrients for plant uptake by providing ample surface area for nutrient adsorption. Sustainability not only focuses on improving soil quality but also on arid ecosystem rehabilitation. It encourages accelerated growth of plants by bacterial biofilm-mediated reclamation of dry lands (Dhawi, 2023 ). Several studies have comprehended the biological role of biofilm-forming bacteria in improving soil structure, which subsequently led to the formulation of application-based strategies. One such strategy is microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP), which harnesses the ability of ureolytic bacteria (e.g., Bacillus pasteruii ) to hydrolyze urea and form calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ) (Raveh-Amit and Tsesarsky, 2020 ). CaCO3  agglutinates the adjoining soil particles, escalating soil strength and stiffness while reducing compressibility and porosity. Meng et al. (2021)  reported that CaCO3  precipitation induced by Sporosarcina pasteurii  (ATCC 11859) elevated the desert soil compactness and prevented erosion. Therefore, biofilm-forming bacteria serve as excellent ecorestoration agents.  3.3 Fly ash polluted lands Coal is extensively used worldwide to meet global electricity energy demands, and about 84% of India's electricity is generated by coal-based thermal power plants. One of the industrial by-products generated during the burning of pulverized coal in thermal power plants is coal fly ash powder. Combustion of pulverized coal releases fly ash, a grey residual fine powder extracted from flue gases (Das and Rout, 2023 ). Central Electricity Authority of India reported that approximately 270.82 million tonnes of fly ash were generated in 2021- 22, with a 95.95% utilization rate (CEA, 2021 ). The remaining unutilized portion in the form of slurry is dumped into the lands around the power plant. Improper dumping of these solid wastes results in metal and metalloid contamination through leaching and seepage, severely impacting the adjacent ecosystems (Pandey et al., 2014 ). Fly ash lands fail to support plant growth, being deficient in nitrogen (N2 ) and phosphorous (P). In the current scenario, the fly ash disposal method contributes to several growth challenges faced by plants, which include receding groundwater quality, declining soil productivity, and low moisture content that eventually affects the overall functioning of higher plants (Tiwari et al., 2019 ; Ramesh et al., 2024 ). Hence, there is a dire need to remediate the fly ash lands for ecorestoration. The reports suggested that biological agents like biofilm-producing bacteria offer an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, comprehensive solution that promotes sustainability and streamlines the remediation process (Jain and Tembhurkar, 2022 ). The fact that plants were able to grow in bioaugmented fly ash fields indicates that the inoculation of bacterial species has altered the unarable land and made it suitable for supporting vegetation. Roychowdhury et al. (2018)  reported that arsenic from fly ash was efficiently sequestered by two exopolysaccharide-producing strains, HMR9 and HMR5, this study paved the way for the use of metal-resistant biofilm-forming bacteria in bioremediating metal containing fly ash soils. In addition to playing a direct role in bioremediation, bacteria can indirectly facilitate the restoration of fly ash-contaminated soil by assisting phytoremediation (Seth, 2012 ). Inoculation of plant growth-promoting biofilm-forming bacterial species like Bacillus endophyticus  NBRFT4, Bacillus pumilus  NBRFT9, and Paenibacillus macerans  NBRFT5 in Saccharum munja  promoted plant growth and enhanced uptake of Ni, Zn, and Fe (Tiwari et al., 2013 ).  3.4 Mine lands The mining industry contributes to economic prosperity and catalyzes social improvement in developing nations. With an annual production of roughly 19–25 billion tons of solid waste, of which 5–8 billion tons are fine-grained tailings, mining is the world's largest industry producer of trash (Qaidi et al., 2022 ). Topsoil depletion, a consequence of mining activities, alters the natural physicochemical attributes of the soil and adversely affects the thriving vegetation cover. The compact structure of soil may be compromised due to shifting, deposition, and compression of the mined soil, resulting in soil aggregate breakdown. The nutrient flow within the soil eventually decelerates, which causes soil nutrient depletion, indigenous microbiota loss, and vulnerability to erosion by wind (Swab et al., 2017 ). The tailings from precious metal mines, such as gold mining operations, are often tiny particles easily carried by wind and migrate across great distances (Dong et al., 2019 ). Mine tailings often contain dissolved sulfide minerals like pyrite (FeS2 ), arsenopyrite (FeAsS), and galena (PbS), which further accumulate in the soil and water sediments, resulting in soil degradation. Implementing efficient and sustainable soil stabilizing techniques is essential for restoring abandoned mining areas (Zang et al., 2015 ). Prior research proposed that creating a physical barrier using bacterial biofilm over the mine tailings was done to restrict oxygen diffusion and prevent sulfide mineral oxidation (García-Meza et al., 2011 ). It is evident that since cyanobacteria are autotrophic communities, their biofilm can remarkably assist in reviving biogeochemical cycles, mineralization of metals, and pedogenesis in abandoned mine lands. Cyanobacteria agglutinate and entangle loosely bound soil particles by filamentous growth and secretion of EPS. A study by Rezasoltani et al. (2021)  revealed that EPS promoted the formation of a robust biocrust, which is expected to shield the soil from wind erosion. In the experiment, the inoculation of two biofilm-forming cyanobacterial species, Anabaena  sp. and Nostoc muscorum,  to the Northern Ontario gold mines resulted in cohesive biocrust formation that exhibited a high degree of robustness and resilience to wind-mediated erosion. N. muscorum  and Anabaena  sp. can absorb carbon (C) and N2  from the atmosphere and incorporate them into the mine tailings. Enrichment of mine soil with these essential elements results in improved soil fertility and further supports vegetation (Rezasoltani et al., 2023 ). Similar results were found upon inoculating the EPS-producing strain Microcoleus vaginatus  ATHK43 to the semi-arid soils. In addition to the biocrust formation, a remarkable nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium increase was observed (Karimi et al., 2023 ). This potent cyanobacteria species can also be implemented in the mine lands to investigate its efficiency in remediating the mine tailings. Because of the crucial function that EPS-producing cyanobacteria play in alleviating the ecosystem, this species can be considered a sustainable biogeotechnological solution for restoring and improving soil qualities of mine lands. However, the exploration of the multifaceted role of bacterial biofilm in remediating the mine lands has been notably limited, and further work is necessary to elucidate the detailed mechanism of biofilm-mediated strategies to remediate mine lands.   4 Air quality improvement: biofilm applications in biofiltration Gaseous emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources release harmful air pollutants into the environment. While outdoor pollution is primarily due to emissions from industrial and vehicular exhaust, indoor pollution is elevated by smoking and combustion activities such as cooking and open fires. Prolonged exposure to these indoor and outdoor air pollutants can cause various cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders in affected individuals (Leung, 2015 ; Pompilio and Di Bonaventura, 2020 ; González-Martín et al., 2024 ). Recent studies highlighted that the rising concentrations of indoor VOCs have raised serious concerns among households because of their carcinogenic properties (Russell et al., 2014 ; Gonzalez-Martin et al., 2021 ). Among the various air pollution mitigation strategies, biofiltration using microbes is a widely used biological treatment method to control the emissions and carry out the transformation of air pollutants (Fig. 2  ). In these systems, the polluted gas is vented off through the porous packing material associated with the microbial biofilm layer. The soluble organic compounds get transferred to the surrounding aqueous medium to reach the biofilm, which is further degraded by microbial activity (Fulazzaky et al., 2014 ; Cheng et al., 2022 ; Sheoran et al., 2022 ). Application of bacterial biofilm-EPS in biofilters demonstrated high VOC removal efficiency, rendering bacterial biofilm as an appropriate mode for the purification of air pollutants (Estrada et al., 2013 ). Integration of bacterial biofilm into the bioreactors can offer an effective solution for the treatment of volatile air pollutants. Additionally, biofilters can also serve as a valuable tool for the treatment of waste and odorous gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx ) and sulfur oxides (SOx ) (Wu et al., 2018 ). However, excessive adhesion of PM to biofilter may lead to their clogging. Furthermore, the application of the multispecies biofilm over biofilters might offer several advantages over single bacteria for the transformation of gaseous pollutants (Han et al., 2016 ; Xie et al., 2021 ; Pineda et al., 2023 ). Table 2   summarizes various mechanisms employed by bacterial biofilm to control the emission of air pollutants. 4.1 Volatile organic compounds and hydrocarbons Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are semi-volatile organic chemicals of higher vapor pressure and low water solubility. Vehicular and industrial emissions, especially those from petroleum industries, significantly contribute to VOC pollution (Massolo et al., 2010 ; Sun et al., 2020 ). Along with that, indoor activities such as smoking, painting, renovation, and other household activities associated with gaseous discharge contribute to the indoor release of VOCs (Chin et al., 2014 ). Biofilters associated with bacterial biofilm not only entrap the VOCs but also carry out subsequent degradation of these air pollutants. For instance, hazardous VOCs such as toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene, and xylene are efficiently removed up to 61% by bacterial biofilm. Feng et al. (2019)  observed that the formation of matured biofilm over a suitable carbon-rich substrate showed superior VOC removal efficiency. The higher EPS content in matured biofilm facilitated more significant VOC removal, where hydrophobic VOCs interacted with the protein counterparts of EPS, enhancing their sorption on the biofilm surface (Feng et al., 2019 ; Deng et al., 2023 ). EPS proteins might play a vital role in the mass transfer of the hydrophobic VOCs. Apart from that, the addition of surfactants such as tween 20 significantly enhanced the mass transfer of hydrophobic VOCs such as n-hexane and dichloromethane by Pseudomonas mendocina  and Methylobacterium rhodesianum  biofilm (Deng et al., 2023 ). Tween 20 increased the protein content of EPS, which in turn increased the hydrophobicity of biofilm. This enabled the mass transfer of the hydrophobic VOCs in the gaseous phase to the biofilm, which undergoes further metabolism. However, the metabolism of recalcitrant VOCs is challenging to achieve. The use of a single biofiltration technique to filter out the organic waste gas with relatively higher VOCs concentration might be a challenge due to reduced efficiency or clogging resulting from excessive biomass buildup. The removal of hydrophobic VOCs by the biofilters might be challenging due to the hindrance caused by mass transfer resistance. In addition, the high concentration of VOCs might also exert toxic effects on the bacterial biofilm used in the biofilters (Wu et al., 2023 ). Sun et al. (2022a)  observed that the addition of QS molecules, such as exogenous AHLs, optimized the biofilm formation, facilitating the degradation of recalcitrant chlorobenzene. Moreover, the application of exogenous AHLs and AHLs-producing bacteria developed a mesoporous biofilm within biofilters, thereby improving VOC removal across variable environmental conditions (Sun et al., 2022b ). Biofilters enable the most efficient removal of hydrophobic VOCs, whereas biotrickling filters are suitable for removing hydrophilic VOCs (Gospodarek et al., 2019 ; Cheng et al., 2020 ). Indoor air pollutants primarily consist of VOCs, although their concentrations are typically lower than those in outdoor air. Therefore, modified technologies, such as using latex-based biocoating reactors with immobilized microbial biofilm, were employed to improve the bioavailability of pollutants (González-Martín et al., 2022 ). The porous latex matrix allows the biofilm to reach a steady state, prolonging its activity for continuous biofiltration of indoor air. The VOC degradation rate depends on three significant factors: the water solubility and bioavailability of the VOC, which are the major factors, followed by compound-specific degradation kinetics of the bacterial biofilm. Therefore, specific strains with xenobiotic degradation potential are applied as biofilm in biofilter reactors (Mohamed et al., 2016 ). Microbial community biofilm acclimatized to pollutants is beneficial for the filtration of industrial waste gas or flue gas to remove high concentrations of VOCs rapidly (Wu et al., 2023 ). The community biofilm develops a degradation-conducive environment facilitating the degradation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic VOCs.  4.2 Nitrogen oxides Nitrogen oxides (NOx ) are primary air pollutants that form the major component of photochemical smog. NOx  emissions lead to environmental hazards, including acid rain and tropospheric ozone layer depletion (Han et al., 2016 ). Employing a bio-trickling filter with microbial biofilm as the filtration medium presented a promising alternative for denitrification of N2 . Inside the biofilter, NOx  is adsorbed and converted to N2  via denitrification by denitrifying bacteria in the biofilm, significantly lowering NOx  levels in gas streams. However, reactor conditions like alkaline pH and liquid-to-gas ratio are essential for obtaining satisfactory denitrification of NOx  gas (Xie et al., 2021 ). While anaerobic bacteria are commonly recognized for their role in denitrification, aerobic bacteria such as Pseudomonas , Bacillus , and Alcaligenes  have demonstrated the ability to utilize O2  and N2  as terminal electron acceptors for simultaneous denitrification (Wu et al., 2013 ). Xie et al. (2021)  observed the abundance of phylum Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi in biofilm formed over biofilter, known for reducing nitrate (NO3 − ) to nitrite (NO2 − ) within the bioreactor. Pseudomonas aeruginosa  PCN-2 biofilm immobilized in a bio-trickling filter showed the potential to denitrify NOx  using aerobic and anaerobic mechanisms. Immobilized biofilm showed stable removal efficiency of 92.39%–95.35%, even under increasing NOx  and O2  concentrations. The consistent expression of nitrogen-reducing enzymes such as nitrate reductase (napA ), cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase (nirS ), and nitric oxide reductase (cnorB ) ensured stepwise reduction of NOx →NO2 − →NO→N2 O→N2  gas. Biofilm enabled complete denitrification under aerobic conditions by creating an anoxic zone in the inner region, preventing the inhibition of the nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ ) enzyme (Zheng et al., 2016 ). Bacterial biofilm adsorbs NOx  under the vapor phase to oxidize NOx  into NO3 −  using nitrification and oxidation mechanisms, which were further reduced into inert N2  (Reddy et al., 2012 ). The nitric oxide (NO) is oxidized to NO3 −  in the aerobic region of the biofilm, whereas denitrification is carried out in the anaerobic and anoxic zone (Wei et al., 2016 ). NOx  gases are adsorbed by the biofilm-EPS, leading to a simultaneous rise in EPS production with an increase in NOx  concentration (Li et al., 2016 ). The polysaccharide and humic acid contents of EPS increased with NO concentration, indicating a positive correlation with NO removal. The strong polarity of carboxyl groups (COO–) in the polysaccharide binds to the NO. Moreover, NO shows hydrophobic interaction with the aromatic groups of proteins and membrane lipids of the EPS, facilitating NO adsorption (Huang et al., 2023 ). Higher NOx  concentrations promote protein and enzyme synthesis in EPS, catalyzing NOx  metabolism (Ding et al., 2019 ). Biofilm biofilters effectively reduce NOx  emissions from industrial gases due to their functional dynamics, including the role of EPS in adsorption. However, maintaining optimal reactor conditions is essential to ensure effective denitrification.  4.3 Sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide Hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) and sulfur dioxides (SO2 ) are colorless, poisonous gases with rotten egg odor, released along with other volatile compounds during the thermal drying of organic matter and fossil fuels (Weng et al., 2015 ; Lestari et al., 2016 ). Emission of these gases has a toxic effect on the environment, leading to acid rain and causing acute respiratory disorders in individuals exposed to them. Treatment of sulfur gas in biofilter reactors involves transfer from gaseous to liquid phase, leading to adsorption by biofilm. SO2  is water soluble; upon transfer to the surrounding liquid medium, SO2  is oxidized to SO3 2−  → SO4 3−  which is further degraded to sulfide (S2− ) and H2 S by sulfur-reducing bacteria such as Clostridium  sp. and Desulfobacteria  sp. on the biofilm (Zhang et al., 2015 ; González-Sánchez and Posten, 2017 ). The sulfur-oxidizing bacteria on the biofilter further oxidize S2−  to S0  (elemental sulfur), ensuring comprehensive transformation and a decrease in the emission of secondary pollutants (Xie et al., 2021 ). H2 S gas is one of the toxic intermediates formed during sulfur gas treatment. The exopolysaccharide components of sulfur-reducing bacterial EPS participate in sulfate reduction into H2 S (Yan et al., 2020 ). Under the O2  limiting state, H2 S gas is oxidized into S0 , whereas H2 S is transformed into SO4 3−  in O2  abundance. Sulfur-reducing bacteria of genera Thiobacillus , Sulphobacillus , and Acidobacillus  use H2 S as an electron donor and O2  as an electron acceptor to carry out sulfur gas treatment (Rujisangvittaya and Phoolphundh, 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2022b ). These bacteria release oxidase enzymes such as “cytochrome C,” which participate in the transformation of H2 S into S0 . The biological removal rate of sulfur gas due to diffusional transfer into biofilm is directly proportional to the concentration gradient of H2 S (Gerrity et al., 2016 ). Bioreactor conditions such as pH, distribution of O2 , pressure, immobilized biofilm, and biofilm moistening play crucial roles in H2 S removal. Bonilla-Blancas et al. (2015)  observed that non-wetted biofilm in a bioreactor could eliminate 65% of H2 S compared to wetted biofilm. The elimination of H2 S gas was found to be higher at acidic pH due to the formation of thinner biofilm biomass, which promoted the mass transfer of O2  into the biofilm. The acidic environment favored the oxidation of H2 S into corresponding sulfates, whereas the alkaline environment promoted the accumulation of elemental sulfur. Moreover, the acidic environment favored the growth of acidophilic bacteria, which showed tolerance to higher inlet rates of H2 S gas (Jia et al., 2022 ). Besides that, phylum Proteobacteria and Epsilonbacteraeota showed increased tolerance to SO4 2−  and S2−  gas that facilitates desulfurization reactions (Zhang et al., 2022b ). Sulfur-reducing and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria remain active during different phases of the SO2  removal process. Immobilization of mixed biofilm ensures the continuous and efficient removal of sulfur compounds.  4.4 Other gaseous pollutants Biofiltration, using bacterial biofilm, is the current leading strategy for the remediation of significant air pollutants. However, conventional physico-chemical processes still remove air pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO) and PMs. Biofilm biofiltration offers a sustainable solution for eliminating these pollutants from indoor and outdoor environments. Anthropogenic activities such as fuel burning and vehicular emissions contribute to a large proportion of CO pollution. Daily exposure to CO gas has led to various cases of neurotoxicity and myocardial infractions in affected individuals (Levy, 2015 ; Reboul et al., 2017 ). The biofiltration of CO-polluted air leads to its conversion into carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and water due to microbial activity within the bacterial biofilm matrix. Immobilization of carboxydotrophs in bioreactors participated in the conversion process. Biofiltration could remove up to 85% of the CO gas after 120 s of retention time. However, the CO diffusion rate acted as a limiting factor, which required further optimization. PM is a fine air pollutant of size 0.005–100 μm, well known for causing chronic respiratory disorders in affected individuals. PM10  and PM2.5  are commonly found in the aerosols that contaminate the environment. It is concerning that indoor air exhibits a higher PM concentration than outdoors (Oh et al., 2014 ). Biofilm-based filters could be an effective solution to reduce PM emissions. While adhesion of PM to the biofilm before their emission could reduce their concentration in the environment, it is noteworthy that organic PMs serve as a carbon source for the bacteria, which can subsequently increase the biofilm biomass within bioreactors (Sivadon et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, increased biomass may impede O2  diffusion through the biofilm, reducing their mass transfer efficacy, which needs careful monitoring before implication in biofiltration reactors. Besides, applying advanced, cost-effective technology, such as fabricating “Biosmotraps” using bacterial biofilm, could be a sustainable solution for treating indoor air pollutants (Yewale et al., 2022 ). Poor air quality index has become a matter of global concern as it contributes to significant health issues in affected individuals. The current available physical and chemical methods fail to address various challenges associated with air pollution control. Biofilm-based remediation offers an efficient solution to overcome the limitations of conventional processes. However, an extensive study is still required to optimize the operation of biofilters, maintain biofilm beds, and assess the potential risks associated with them. Through appropriate implementation and proper modulation, bacterial biofilm could be an ecologically sound alternative to limit air pollutant emission to a greater extent.   5 Water remediation through bacterial biofilm Although over 70% of the Earth's surface is covered by water, only 3% is suitable for human consumption, among which 97% is saline water. Water scarcity affects around 4 billion people globally each month, with only 3% of Earth's water suitable for human consumption, and most of that being saline. The disparity between freshwater availability and demand exacerbates this issue, emphasizing the urgent need for clean water access. Wastewater from various sources contains pollutants like nutrients, heavy metals, and organic matter, posing health and environmental risks. The wastewater discharged from various domestic, agricultural, and industrial sectors contains high physical impurities such as color, odor, turbidity, solid particles, and high load of nutrients like C, N, and P salts, alkalinity, heavy metals, and high BOD and COD (Sathya et al., 2022 ). Consequently, wastewater treatment is crucial for meeting regulatory standards. Biological methods, like bacterial biofilm, offer cost-effective and eco-friendly options compared to energy-intensive chemical treatments, making them essential for environmental restoration (Rashid et al., 2021 ). Fig. 3   summarizes the various mechanisms employed by bacterial biofilm to control water pollution. Biofilm-forming bacteria reduce physicochemical factors such as BOD, COD, and TDS. Bacillus cereus  CR1 effectively removed 80% BOD, 65% COD, and 67% TDS (Kumari et al., 2016a ). Bacterial biofilm can remediate heavy metals, including lead, nickel, cadmium, mercury, and chromium. In addition, biofilm-forming bacteria remove organic pollutants such as total nitrogen, ammonia (NH3 ), phosphate (PO4 3− ), NO3 − , and NO2 − . Biofilm-forming Bacillus cereus  GS-5 removed 41% of total nitrogen and 60% of PO4 3−  from domestic sewage (Rout et al., 2017 ). Further, the consortium of the biofilm-forming bacteria reduces more nutrients than the individual biofilm-forming bacteria. The biofilm-forming bacterial consortium of Bacillus cereus  OS36, Lysinibacillus macroides  ST13, and Burkholderia multivorans  DF12 efficiently reduced 76% BOD, 61% COD, 68% TDS, 62% NH3 , 72% total nitrogen, and 66% PO4 3−  (Mallick and Das, 2024 ). In addition, bacterial biofilm remediates plastic debris, such as microplastic (Debroy et al., 2022 ). In a study by Auta et al. (2017) , the result indicated that Bacillus cereus  reduced microplastic weights by 1.6% for polyethylene (PE), 6.6% for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and 7.4% for polystyrene (PS). B. gottheilii  achieved reductions of 6.2% for PS, 3.0% for PET, 3.6% for PE, and 5.8% for PS. Additionally, Bacillus , Arthrobacter , Rhodococcus , and Pseudomonas  reduced PE weight by 7.4% and low-density PE by 15%. Moreover, the development of bacterial biofilm over a biocarrier assists in enhancing the treatment of contaminated wastewater. For instance, the application of bacterial biofilm in a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and dissolved air flotation (DAF) system for the treatment of oil-contaminated wastewater effectively reduced the levels of COD, ammonia, nitrate, oil-grease, and turbidity (Ali and Aziz, 2024 ). Thus, wastewater bioremediation using bacterial biofilm is an environmentally friendly method for removing harmful pollutants to protect and preserve the water from various inorganic and organic contaminants in contaminated wastewater. Table 3   summarizes the examples of different bacteria used to mitigate various organic, inorganic, and micropollutants in the wastewater. Thus, bacterial biofilm-mediated remediation has emerged as an affordable and environmentally friendly alternative for environmental clean-up due to its remarkable flexibility, functionality, genetic diversity, and cellular simplicity. 5.1 Agriculture wastewater remediation by bacterial biofilm Agricultural wastewater remediation through bacterial biofilm is the most promising approach to mitigate the wastewater discharged from the agricultural field. Agricultural activities often produce wastewater from the field containing various pollutants such as nutrients, pesticides, and organic matter, negatively impacting soil and water quality if not treated properly. Bacterial biofilm offers an effective and sustainable approach for treating agricultural wastewater due to its ability to degrade organic pollutants, immobilize heavy metals, and remove excess nutrients. Bacterial biofilm plays a crucial role in the biodegradation of organic pollutants in agricultural wastewater. Bacteria within the biofilm produce enzymes that break down complex organic compounds into simpler, less toxic forms. This degradation process helps to reduce the organic pollutants from the wastewater before discharge into the environment. Bacterial biofilm produced by Pseudomonas putida  has efficiency in removing 100% of 2, 4- Dichlorophenol (2, 4-DCP) from synthetic wastewater in a rotating perforated tube biofilm bioreactor (Kargi and Eker, 2005 ). The mixed bacterial community of Stenotrophomonas  sp., Burkholderia kuturiensis,  and Burkholderia  sp. was found to remove 99% of 2, 4, 6-Trichorophenol (2, 4, 6-TCP) using packed-bed biofilm reactor (Mishra et al., 2022 ). Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes  NP-103 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  N6P6 degrade phenanthrene and pyrene in the presence of synthetic AHLs (Mangwani et al., 2016b ). In addition, biofilm-forming bacteria can immobilize heavy metals such as cadmium, nickel, and chromium in the soil through biosorption, bioaccumulation, and biomineralization, thereby preventing their leaching into water bodies and soil. Biofilm formation of Enterobacter cloacae  MC9 removed heavy metals, including cadmium, lead, chromium, and nickel (Syed et al., 2021 ). Moreover, bacterial biofilm removes excess nutrients, such as N and P, from agricultural wastewater. Certain biofilm-forming bacterial species can nitrify and denitrify, converting NH3  and NO3 −  into N2 , which is then released harmlessly into the atmosphere. Nitrifying bacteria like Nitrosomonas  sp. and Nitrobacter vulgaris  convert NH3  into NO3 −  through nitrification, while denitrifying bacteria such as Thiobacillus dentrificans  and Pseudomonas  sp. further convert NO3 −  into N2  through denitrification (Preena et al., 2021 ). This nutrient removal process helps prevent eutrophication and algal blooms in receiving water bodies, preserving aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, bacterial biofilm aids in the breakdown of pesticides, insecticides, and agrochemicals used in the agricultural field for the high productivity of the crops. Bacterial biofilm produces EPS that metabolizes these contaminants, transforming them into less toxic or non-toxic compounds. This detoxification process reduces the environmental impact of agricultural chemicals and helps protect water quality. Biofilm-forming bacteria Pseudomonas putida  T7, when treated with 100 mg/l Paclobutrazol, has the potential to degrade the insecticide by 98.3% and produce 4-chlorobenzoic acid as the degradation product (Shahid et al., 2023 ). Similarly, Acinetobacter  sp. ZX01 degraded 87% cyromazine insecticide (Wu et al., 2022 ). Moreover, biofilm-forming bacteria isolated from agricultural soil, including Paracoccus  sp. and Achromobacter  sp., can potentially degrade the insecticide. It has been reported that Paracoccus  sp. and Achromobacter  sp. can degrade imidacloprid by 96.2% into 3, 5, 6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and diethyl thiophosphate as final metabolites (Gao et al., 2021 ). The different biofilm-forming soil bacterial isolates Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , Pseudomonas stutzeri , Rhizobium radiobacter , Pseudomonas putida , Achromobacter xylosooxidans , and Ochrobactrum anthropi  were reported to degrade organophosphate pesticides (Iyer et al., 2018 ). Thus, bacterial biofilm provides effective solutions for agricultural wastewater treatment, promoting sustainable agricultural practices. By harnessing the natural abilities of bacterial communities, agricultural wastewater can be remediated to minimize environmental pollution and ensure the long-term health of ecosystems and water resources.  5.2 Remediation of domestic wastewater Domestic wastewater released from households, including bathrooms, kitchens, and other domestic activities, must be remediated using bacterial biofilm. Bioremediation presents a sustainable and efficient solution for treating sewage water. In domestic wastewater remediation, bacterial biofilm degrades the organic pollutants. Bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Bacillus subtilis , and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus  can break down complex organic compounds present in sewage, including fats, proteins, and carbohydrates (Rajasimman et al., 2021 ). These bacteria produce enzymes that catalyze the decomposition of organic matter, reducing the organic load of the wastewater and improving its quality. Moreover, bacterial biofilm removed the nutrients from domestic wastewater, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, this nutrient removal process prevents eutrophication and algae blooms in receiving water bodies. Furthermore, bacterial biofilm aids in the removal of pathogens and harmful bacteria from domestic wastewater. Certain bacteria within the biofilm, such as Escherichia coli  and Enterococcus faecalis , mitigate the risk of waterborne diseases (Mbanga et al., 2020 ). Blackwater refers to sewage containing faecal matter and organic waste from toilets and other similar sources, which poses significant environmental and public health risks if not adequately mitigated. Bacterial biofilm offers a promising approach for the remediation of blackwater due to its ability to degrade organic matter, remove pathogens, and reduce environmental contamination. Biofilm-forming bacteria can degrade organic matter through anaerobic digestion and fermentation including Clostridium  sp., Bacillus  sp., and Escherichia coli  (Kumar et al., 2018 ). Pseudomonas  sp. and Acinetobacter  sp. have been reported to reduce the abundance of pathogenic organisms, thereby improving the safety of treated water (Al-Jassim et al., 2015 ). Several nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria reduced nutrient levels from the blackwater. It has been reported that Pseudomonas  sp., Paludibacter  sp., and Bacteroides  sp. removed organic matter, phosphorus, NO3 − , and NH3  nitrogen in the process of blackwater remediation (Li et al., 2021 ). Microplastic pollution has become a significant environmental concern, threatening aquatic ecosystems and marine life worldwide. Bacterial biofilm remediates microplastic due to its ability to degrade, sequester, and transform these persistent pollutants. Bacterial biofilm comprised of diverse microbial communities encased in a matrix of EPS helps to colonize microplastic surfaces in aquatic environments. Certain bacteria within the biofilm produce enzymes capable of breaking down the chemical bonds of microplastic, leading to their degradation into smaller fragments. Bacteria like Pseudomonas  sp., Bacillus  sp., Streptococcus  sp., and Rhodococcus  sp. have been identified for their ability to enzymatically degrade various types of plastics, including PE, polypropylene (PP), and PS (Pathak, 2017 ). It has been reported that different bacteria, including Bacillus licheniformis , Lysinibacillus massiliensis , and mixed culture of Bacillus  sp. degraded low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and PS present in the wastewater of particle size 300–500 μm under batch operating conditions with 160 rpm at a temperature of 25 ± 2 °C, pH 7.15 within 22 days (Kučić Grgić et al., 2021 ). Thus, bacterial biofilm-mediated remediation offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to treating domestic wastewater.  5.3 Bacterial biofilm-mediated industrial wastewater remediation Bacterial biofilm-mediated industrial wastewater remediation offers a sustainable and effective approach to treating industrial effluents. Biofilm-forming bacteria degraded the organic pollutants, heavy metals, and microplastic discharged from industries. Heavy metals released from industrial mines and acid mine drainage are the most common pollutants. Metal-tolerant biofilm-forming bacteria, including Cupriavidus metallidurans , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Bacillus subtilis,  can immobilize heavy metals through processes such as biosorption, bioaccumulation, biotransformation, and biomineralization (Meruvu, 2021 ). The EPS matrix produced by biofilm binds heavy metal ions, effectively sequestering them and preventing their release into the environment. The different functional groups of EPS, such as amino, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and sulfate functional groups, are the binding sites for heavy metals. The biofilm-forming bacteria Cellulosimicrobium  sp. and Halomonas aquamarina  TA-04 can reduce over 90% of 500 μg/mL of chromate (Gadkari et al., 2022 ). It has also been noted that Bacillus subtilis  biofilm can accumulate multiple heavy metal ions, including copper, zinc, cadmium, mercury, chromic, and lead (Maity et al., 2023 ). The metal-binding capacity of biofilm has practical applications in biotechnological processes aimed at detoxifying uranium from groundwater. Additionally, studies have shown that a biochar and periphyton-based biofilm system removed almost 95.4% of 2.0 mg/L arsenic (Omran, 2022 ). The presence of functional groups (-OH and -C=O) on the surface of the periphyton biofilm and calcite helped in the adsorption and elimination of arsenic contamination. Thus, the ionizable functional groups within the EPS, and the anionic charge on the microbial surface facilitate the binding sites for various metal ions. PAHs are the most hazardous contaminants due to their aromatic ring structures containing carbon, which can lead to mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in humans. Various biofilm-forming bacterial species have been utilized to remediate PAHs through EPS-mediated biosorption. For instance, the bacterial strain Pseudomonas  sp. ADP metabolized atrazine herbicide, using it as a nitrogen source for its growth (Esquirol et al., 2020 ). It has been reported that the selective enrichment of PAHs contributed to the formation of biofilm by marine bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa  N6P6. Moreover, the AHL synthase enzymes LasI and RHLI were constructed to degrade pyrene and phenanthrene PAH compounds (Kumari et al., 2016b ). The presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl, and phosphoryl functional groups of EPS also helped to capture positively charged pharmaceutical molecules for their degradation. Bacterial biofilm contributes to oil spill remediation by producing extracellular enzymes that break down complex hydrocarbon molecules into simpler compounds. Several bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas , Alcanivorax , and Marinobacter,  have the ability to produce enzymes such as alkane hydroxylases, dioxygenases, and monooxygenases, which facilitate the degradation of various hydrocarbons found in oil (Muriel-Millán et al., 2021 ). Thus, biofilm formed by indigenous marine bacterial communities Rhodococcus erythropolis , Acinobacter aceti , and Pseudomonas  sp. in marine environments can rapidly colonize on oil-contaminated surfaces and facilitate the degradation of hydrocarbons (Mishra et al., 2020 ). Overall, bacterial biofilm-mediated industrial wastewater remediation offers a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable solution to the challenges associated with industrial effluent treatment. Through leveraging the metabolic activities of diverse bacterial communities, biofilm can effectively degrade organic pollutants, immobilize heavy metals, and remove nutrients from industrial wastewater, ultimately promoting cleaner water and reducing environmental pollution. Continued research and innovation in biofilm-based bacterial remediation technologies are essential for advancing sustainable industrial wastewater treatment practices.   6 Role of bacterial biofilm in attaining SDGs Modernization has adverse effects on humanity, such as resource depletion, environmental degradation, and public health emergencies. The depletion and pollution of natural resources and various health disorders degrade living standards for billions of people worldwide. Bacterial biofilm research holds a promising alternative to address multifaceted global challenges for achieving SDGs. The SDGs established by the United Nations outline a comprehensive framework for addressing interconnected global concerns such as economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental stewardship (Saxena et al., 2021 ). To collectively address these challenges, 193 countries have committed to the 17 goals and 169 targets. The SDGs aim to foster economic and societal progress without compromising the environment, emphasizing environmental protection against unlawful resource exploitation. They are critical in promoting green processes and cleaner technologies, including industrial production and biogeochemical processes (Akinsemolu, 2018 ). Bacterial biofilm offers a sustainable approach to address multiple SDGs, spanning economic, social, and environmental realms. Thereby, utilizing the intrinsic capabilities of bacterial biofilm, researchers develop strategies to mitigate environmental impacts, foster societal resilience, and advance comprehensive development concerning ecological outcomes. From bioremediation of contaminated soil and water to production of clean energy and enhancement of agricultural practices, bacterial biofilm presents a versatile toolkit for advancing SDGs (Fig. 4  ). 6.1 Bacterial biofilm improves agricultural productivity: No poverty (SDG 1) and zero hunger (SDG 2) Agricultural production is an essential component in pursuing the goal of sustainable development since it directly impacts poverty eradication and hunger alleviation. SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms, while SDG 2 strives for zero hunger, ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food. Poverty and hunger are two interchangeable terms. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (2023) , 783 million people face extreme hunger daily. Therefore, hunger and poverty must be addressed together, which can be achieved through the better integration of agricultural practices for enhanced sustainability. Bacterial biofilm is a complex bacterial community holding a promising avenue in revolutionizing agricultural practices. Bacterial biofilm is the structured communities encased within a self-produced matrix of EPS. This biofilm adheres to various surfaces, including soil particles and plant roots, forming symbiotic relationships that influence agricultural ecosystems (Ahmad et al., 2017 ). Diverse bacterial species interact synergistically within the biofilm, exchanging nutrients and metabolic byproducts and enhancing overall ecosystem functions. Moreover, bacterial biofilm plays a vital role in soil health by promoting nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition (Anju et al., 2021 ). Biofilm-forming bacteria facilitate the breakdown of complex organic compounds into simpler forms, releasing essential nutrients such as N, P, and K for plant uptake. Biofilm-forming bacteria play a pivotal role in nitrogen supply to plants through both symbiotic and nonsymbiotic mechanisms. Bacillus brevis , Bacillus cereus , Bacillus circulars , Bacillus firmus , Bacillus licheniformis , Bacillus megaterium , Bacillus pumilus , and Bacillus subtilis  has the capacity for biological nitrogen fixation through their nitrogenase activity (Yousuf et al., 2017 ; Herrmann et al., 2023 ). Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, including Rhizobium , Mesorhizobium , and Bradyrhizobium,  reside in specialized structures like root nodules, providing the plant with ammonia derived from atmospheric nitrogen fixation (Provorov and Andronov, 2016 ). However, nonsymbiotic nitrogen fixation involves free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria or diazotrophs not engaged in symbiosis with plants. Burkholderia , Diazotrophicus , Enterobacter , and Pseudomonas  stimulate the growth of nonlegume plants by converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia (Jalal et al., 2022 ). Apart from nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization involves converting insoluble mineral forms of phosphorus into accessible forms for enhanced plant uptake by synthesizing enzymes like phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, and phosphotriesterase. The various bacterial species, including Bacillus , Beijerinckia , Microbacterium , Rhizobium , Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas , and Rhodococcus , participated in the solubilization of inorganic phosphorous (Kour et al., 2019 ). Moreover, Aeromonas , Azadirachta , Azotobacter , Bacillus , Burkholderia , and Pseudomonas  can facilitate plant iron uptake (Pattnaik et al., 2019 ). The siderophores also inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and induce systemic resistance (ISR) in plants. For instance, Pseudomonas putida  B2017 exhibited adverse effects against various plant pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum , Rhizoctonia solani , and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum  through the secretion of siderophores (Costa-Gutierrez et al., 2022 ). Thus, biofilm-forming bacterial strains also compete with the invasion of pathogenic bacteria, suppressing plant diseases. Biofilm-forming bacteria act as potent phytostimulators through the direct growth-promotion mechanism of phytohormone production. They influence processes like cell elongation, cell division, root development, root hair formation, shoot initiation, and tissue differentiation by providing and regulating a diverse array of plant hormones, encompassing gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins, abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Alcaligenes faecalis , Acetobacter diazotrophicus , Herbaspirillum seropedicae , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Bradyrhizobium , Rhizobium , and Pseudomonas  produced IAA (Kumawat et al., 2022 ). Pseudomonas fluorescens , Rhizobium  sp., and Xanthomonas  produced GAs, and Paenibacillus polymyxa , Pseudomonas fluorescens , and Rhodospirillum rubrum  produced cytokinins (David et al., 2018 ; Singh et al., 2019 ). Bacterial biofilm further improves soil structure and water retention capacity, mitigating erosion and enhancing fertility. Biofilm-forming bacteria, such as Bacillus amyloliquifaciens c, improve the soil structure by forming macroaggregates (Hui et al., 2018 ). Moreover, plants treated with EPS-producing bacteria like Azospirillum  improved soil structure and promoted soil aggregation due to their water-holding capacity (Czarnes et al., 2020 ). Biofilm-forming bacteria, including Proteus penneri , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Alcaligenes faecalis,  enhanced soil health by promoting soil aggregation (Rani et al., 2023 ). Thus, bacterial biofilm contributes to sustainable agricultural practices by improving soil health and fostering long-term productivity and resilience. Innovative agricultural innovations use biofilm-mediated nutrient delivery systems to increase fertilizer efficiency and reduce nutrient loss. Fertilizers containing bacterial biofilm matrices improve nutrient retention and slow-release properties, reducing leaching and runoff rates. These biofilm-based fertilizers ensure targeted nutrient delivery to plant roots, optimizing nutrient uptake and minimizing environmental pollution. Biofilm-mediated nutrient delivery systems enhance sustainable agricultural practices by improving fertilizer efficiency, lowering input costs, and environmental impact (Solanki et al., 2020 ). Moreover, bacterial biofilm-based biostimulants and biofertilizers offer sustainable alternatives to traditional chemical inputs. The biofertilizer comprised of biofilm-forming bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa  BUFF12, Proteus mirabilis  BUFF14, and Enterobacter xiangfangensis  BUFF38 enhanced the yield of Foeniculum vulgare  (Dhiman et al., 2022 ). Rhizospheric biofilm containing beneficial bacteria produces metabolites and enzymes that enhance plant nutrient availability, stress tolerance, and disease resistance. Thus, these biofilm-based bacteria stimulate root development, improve nutrient uptake efficiency, and enhance crop yields without relying on synthetic chemicals. Moreover, biofertilizers inoculated with biofilm-forming bacteria enrich soil microbiota, fostering beneficial microbial communities and improving soil fertility over time. The research in rice cultivation has shown that biofilm-forming bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa  improve nutrient availability, water use efficiency, and disease resistance, leading to significant yield increases (Sah et al., 2021 ). Similarly, studies in organic farming systems have demonstrated that biofilm-mediated nutrient delivery systems enhance nutrient use efficiency, improving crop yields and soil health (Solanki et al., 2020 ). These studies highlight the potential of bacterial biofilm technologies to address critical challenges in agriculture while promoting sustainable development. Thus, by promoting soil health, nutrient cycling, plant growth promotion, and disease suppression, bacterial biofilm significantly contributes to sustainable agricultural practices, ensuring food security and livelihoods for present and future generations, targeting SDG 2a and 2b. Thus, bacterial biofilm offers innovative alternative strategies to enhance agricultural productivity, address poverty, and alleviate hunger, aligning with the objectives of SDG 1 and SDG 2.  6.2 Bacterial biofilm prevents waterborne and airborne diseases: good health and well-being (SDG 3) Bacterial biofilm offers a novel approach to disease prevention, particularly in combating waterborne and airborne pathogens to ensure good health and well-being, aiming at SDG 3 under the target 3d. Biofilm acts as a natural barrier, inhibiting the growth and dissemination of pathogenic bacteria and reducing the risk of disease transmission. Moreover, bacterial biofilm plays a significant role in probiotics by facilitating the colonization and persistence of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics are live bacteria that are administered in adequate amounts to improve the health of the host by enhancing the gut microbiome and increasing the bioavailability of nutrients (Sánchez et al., 2017 ). They alter the functioning and composition of the gut microbiota and boost both immunity and neurobiology. Biofilm matrix enables the probiotic bacteria to adhere to the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract, thereby providing a protective environment that enhances the attachment of probiotics, preventing their expulsion through peristalsis and ensuring prolonged contact with the gut lining (Deng et al., 2020 ). Within the biofilm matrix, probiotic bacteria efficiently utilize nutrients present in the gut environment, including dietary fibers and prebiotics. The proximity of microbial cells within the biofilm matrix allows for synergistic interactions and metabolic cooperation, leading to improved nutrient uptake and enhanced probiotic activity. Streptococcus thermophilus  is often used with other probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus,  for synergistic health benefits (Wasilewska et al., 2019 ). Lactobacillus acidophilus , Lactobacillus rhamnosus , and Lactobacillus casei  improved digestive health, boosted immune function, and alleviated symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (Sinn et al., 2008 ). Bifidobacterium breve  also plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health (Chen et al., 2021a ,b ,c ). The biofilm of probiotic bacteria often releases several bioactive compounds that benefit host physiology, including anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. Biofilm by probiotic bacteria further enhances the therapeutic efficacy in various health conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders, immune dysfunction, and metabolic diseases. Waterborne infections are a substantial hazard to public health, especially in areas with inadequate sanitation and water infrastructure. Bacterial biofilm is essential in mitigating waterborne disease by lowering microbial contamination in water distribution systems. For instance, biofilm produced on the inner surfaces of water pipes forms protective coatings that prevent pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli  and Legionella pneumophila  from attaching and growing (Hemdan et al., 2020 ). Thus, bacterial biofilm ensures access to safe and clean drinking water, a key component of SDG 3, by maintaining water quality and preventing pathogenic bacteria from entering the distribution system. The removal of pollutants and pathogens from drinking water is improved by innovative water treatment systems that utilize biofilm-mediated mechanisms. Biofilm-based filtration devices, such as filters and biofilm reactors, use naturally occurring microbial communities to remove organic pollutants and suspended particles and eradicate pathogenic bacteria and viruses (Werkneh, 2022 ). For example, decentralized water treatment facilities have used biofilm reactors with specialized microbial consortia to treat faecal pathogen-contaminated surfaces and groundwater (Gomec, 2010 ). In resource-constrained environments, these biofilm-based technologies provide cost-effective and long-term solutions for improving water quality and reducing waterborne infections. Airborne diseases, often transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols, pose significant health challenges. Bacterial biofilm plays a pivotal role in reducing the transmission of airborne pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , Streptococcus pyogenes , Klebsiella pneumonia , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis  by trapping and deactivating them in ventilation systems and indoor surfaces (Zhi et al., 2022 ). Bacterial biofilm formed on air filters and ventilation and air conditioning ducts capture airborne particles, including bacteria, viruses, and allergens, preventing their dissemination and reducing the risk of respiratory infections. Biofilm-mediated processes are often employed by developing air purification devices to eliminate airborne pollutants and enhance indoor air quality. The removal efficiency of airborne contaminants is increased by biofilm-coated filtration media, which include fibrous membranes and activated carbon filters (Zhang et al., 2022c ). These materials offer surfaces for microbial colonization and biofilm development. Moreover, biofilm-coated air purifiers with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) have been used in hospitals to combat the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza. Bacillus subtilis  biofilm acts as a matrix that traps and degrades airborne pollutants, including VOCs, allergens, and pathogens, as they pass through the air purifier (Sahay and Wozniak, 2017 ). Similarly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  forms a robust biofilm that adheres to surfaces within air purifiers and traps various airborne particles (Marra et al., 2023 ). Thus, these biofilm-based air filtration devices provide an energy-efficient approach to improving respiratory health and reducing the spread of airborne diseases.  6.3 Biofilm-mediated wastewater remediation: clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) Clean water and sanitation are fundamental human rights and critical components of sustainable development. However, wastewater pollution significantly threatens water quality and public health worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 780 million people are deprived of proper access to water sources, and 2.5 million lack improved sanitation. One out of four people is estimated to suffer from an acute freshwater shortage by 2050. The improper sanitation and contaminated wastewater result in the spread of various diseases like diarrhea, cholera, neglected tropical diseases, guinea worm disease, colitis, and trachoma (Jena et al., 2023 ). Thus, sanitation is vital to human health, and treating contaminated wastewater is the most predominant concern. For this reason, SDG 6 aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of sewage and sanitation. Among various wastewater treatment methods, bacterial biofilm-mediated wastewater remediation offers a promising approach to address the challenges associated with wastewater pollution. Biofilm is crucial in removing organic and inorganic contaminants through physical, chemical, and biological processes in wastewater treatment. Several toxic heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, and chromium, also contaminate the wastewater. In the physical processes, bacterial biofilm provides a large surface area for adsorption and accumulating suspended solids and colloidal particles in wastewater. As water flows through biofilm reactors, particles are trapped within the biofilm matrix, facilitating their removal from the wastewater. Moreover, heavy metals are remediated from wastewater through different mechanisms such as bioaccumulation, bioprecipitation, biosorption, and biotransformation. In the chemical bioremediation process, biofilm-forming bacteria produce several enzymes and metabolites that facilitate the degradation and transformation of organic pollutants in wastewater (Haque et al., 2022b ). These bacterial-mediated chemical reactions lead to the breakdown of complex organic compounds into simpler, less harmful substances, reducing the organic load and improving water quality. Aerobic and anaerobic biofilm-forming bacteria participate in various biological processes, including nitrification, denitrification, and phosphorus removal, contributing to nutrient removal and biodegradation of pollutants. Bacterial biofilm produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa  and Bacillus subtilis  degrades the organic pollutants, such as PAHs, in the wastewater (Ghorbannezhad et al., 2022 ). Moreover, this bacterial biofilm adheres to oil droplets in oil spills. It utilizes enzymes like hydroxylases and dioxygenases to break down complex hydrocarbons into simpler compounds that the bacteria can metabolize. Several bacteria, including Pseudomonas  spp. and Bacillus subtilis,  can degrade PAHs as a carbon and energy source (Kiamarsi et al., 2019 ). These bacteria produce enzymes, dioxygenases, and monooxygenases that break down PAH polymers into monomers, which the bacteria can then utilize for growth and metabolism. Biofilm-forming bacteria such as Shewanella  spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  produce a biofilm that facilitates the reduction of toxic heavy metal ions, including cadmium, lead, mercury, chromium, and arsenic, to less toxic or insoluble forms (Syed et al., 2023 ). However, some bacterial biofilm promotes the biomineralization of heavy metal ions by precipitating them into insoluble metal sulfides, oxides, or carbonates. The most promising approach for wastewater treatment is the development of bioreactors. The bioreactors offer several advantages, such as enhanced pollutant removal efficiency, reduced sludge production, shorter hydraulic retention times (HRT), and a high amount of active biomass. Thus, bacterial biofilm-mediated bioreactors have been extensively employed to purify heavily contaminated wastewater. Membrane biofilm reactors (MBRs) are involved in wastewater treatment, integrating the bacterial biofilm processes with membrane filtration technology to remove contaminants from wastewater efficiently. MBRs utilize biofilm-forming bacteria, including Pseudomonas  spp., Bacillus  spp., Nitrosomonas  spp., Nitrobacter  spp., and Acinetobacter  spp., that produced on the surface of a semi-permeable membrane (Moloantoa et al., 2022 ). The biofilm provides a protective environment for bacterial growth and facilitates the degradation of organic matter, nutrients, and other harmful contaminants in the wastewater. The semi-permeable membrane in MBRs acts as a physical barrier that separates suspended solids with bacteria from the treated water. After treatment, the purified water eliminates harmful organic nutrients such as nitrogen, NH3 , NO3 −  and PO4 3− , along with a substantial decrease in BOD and COD (Hasan et al., 2021 ). The most recent implementation of a bioreactor is the MBBR plants, which are widely used for treating municipal and industrial wastewater. This approach combines the most beneficial features of activated sludge and biofiltration processes. All the processes, including aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic processes, occur simultaneously within the reactor. The key feature of this method is the utilization of carriers that serve as substrates for biofilm growth, which move freely within the reactor. In aerobic processes, the movement of the carriers is propelled by gas agitation, while mechanical mixing ensures carrier mobility in anaerobic and anoxic processes. The use of mobile beds has the most advantageous effect in reducing congestion and enabling the utilization of the entire bioreactor volume (Zydney, 2016 ). Turbulence within the reactor, generated by shearing forces, facilitates proper compound diffusion with the bacterial biofilm while maintaining a thin biofilm layer. Additionally, this approach eliminates or reduces the need for biomass recirculation, which is a significant concern in the case of activated sludge systems and fixed bed biofilm (Waqas et al., 2020 ). In terms of energy consumption, the MBBR system with continuous aeration demanded a total energy requirement of 0.17–0.25 kWh/m3 , whereas the conventional activated sludge (CAS) treatment process consumed energy ranging from 0.16 to 2.07 kWh/m3 , as reported by different studies (Bodik and Kubaska, 2013 ; Dias et al., 2018 ; di Biase et al., 2019 ). Thus, bacterial biofilm-mediated wastewater remediation holds great promise for achieving SDG 6 following target 6a by providing sustainable solutions for clean treated water and proper sanitation for future generations. Many developing countries have recently paid huge attention to clean water and sanitation. Moreover, increased community engagement in water supply and sanitation initiatives can improve outcomes. In India, nationwide sanitation campaigns such as Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign—NBA), Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission—SBA) are conducted to ensure access to clean water (Routray et al., 2017 ). Similarly, the RAIN project, supported by the Coca-Cola company, aims to provide safe drinking water to the African population (Atuluku, 2022 ). Moreover, the Imo State Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Nigeria is a comparable initiative focused on improving water supply for the Nigerian population.  6.4 Biofuel sustainable energy production by bacterial biofilm: affordable clean energy (SDG 7) Biofuel sustainable energy production through bacterial biofilm technology contributes significantly to achieving SDG 7. Bacterial biofilm offers a promising avenue for sustainable energy production due to their unique metabolic capabilities and ability to convert organic substrates efficiently into biofuels. The advantage of biofuel production using bacterial biofilm is their ability to utilize diverse feedstock, including agricultural residues, organic waste, and even wastewater, thus reducing reliance on finite fossil fuel resources (Gautam et al., 2022 ). This versatility enhances energy security and resilience while addressing environmental concerns associated with conventional energy sources. Moreover, biofuel production by bacterial biofilm promotes environmental sustainability by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change (Neogi et al., 2022 ). In addition, biofuel production through bacterial biofilm supports economic growth and social development by creating opportunities for decentralized energy production and rural development. Bacterial biofilm has huge potential for generating renewable and inexhaustible biofuel and bioenergy. Various types of biofuels, including biodiesel, butanol, bioethanol, and biogas, can be produced from bacterial biomass. Recent advancements in research and technology have revealed that biofilm-mediated technology can significantly contribute to producing sustainable energy on a larger scale. Biofilm-forming bacterial fermentation of both liquid and solid biomass yields biogas, which can be used for transportation or generating power and heat (Wicker et al., 2023 ). Biofilm-forming bacteria such as Shewanella oneidensis  MR-1 and Geobacter sulfurreducens  MP can convert organic matter such as starch or sugar into useable electricity (Thapa et al., 2022 ). This underscores the potential of bacterial biofilm in generating cleaner and more sustainable electricity. The widespread adoption of this energy-saving technology is required for further research and development. Thus, biofuels have the potential to serve as a substantial energy source and can help to alleviate global fuel challenges. Biofilm-forming bacteria, mainly acid-tolerant bacteria, have the potential to produce bioelectricity. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) represents a bioelectrochemical apparatus that converts energy into bioelectricity. Biofilm-forming bacteria expedite the breakdown of biodegradable compounds found in wastewater, generating bioelectricity (Mahto and Das, 2024 ). In an MFC, the bacteria are positioned within the anode chamber, where they initiate the oxidation process of both organic and inorganic substrates present in wastewater, producing CO2 , protons, and electrons as byproducts (Jatoi et al., 2021 ). The protons generated at the anode travel towards the cathode through a proton exchange membrane, while the electrons are directed to the cathode via an external electrical circuit. Consequently, O2  is reduced at the cathode. Several biofilm-forming acid-tolerant bacteria, Acidithiobacillus  sp. and Ferroplasma  sp., can effectively act as bioelectrocatalysts under acidic conditions utilizing tetrathionate as an electron donor (Mallick and Das, 2023 ). Thus, biofuel sustainable energy production by bacterial biofilm technology represents a sustainable solution to achieve SDG 7 under target 7.1 while addressing interconnected environmental, social, and economic challenges. By harnessing the power of bacterial biofilm, we can accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.  6.5 Applications of bacterial biofilm in agricultural and industrial innovations: decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) and industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9) Bacterial biofilm has wide applications in various agricultural and industrial sectors, driving advancements aligned with SDG 8 and SDG 9. SDG 8 aims to reduce unemployment rates, enhance labor efficiency, and foster economic expansion. It has been reported that labor productivity dropped to 2.812% from 2016 to 2021, reflecting global economic challenges and widespread underpayment of workers worldwide (Kanbur, 2021 ). The unemployment rate was 5.1%. The central objective of SDG 8 revolves around generating employment opportunities for vulnerable groups such as women, rural inhabitants, and individuals with low incomes or lacking employment in urban areas. This bacterial biofilm is pivotal in enhancing productivity, promoting sustainability, and fostering innovation in various economic sectors. In agriculture, bacterial biofilm contributes to plant growth promotion, nutrient cycling, and improving soil health. For instance, Rhizobium  sp. forms symbiotic associations with leguminous plants, facilitating nitrogen fixation and improving soil fertility (Jaiswal et al., 2021 ). This enhances agricultural productivity and reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers, promoting economic efficiency and sustainability. In addition, bacterial biofilm colonizing on the surface of plant roots enhances nutrient uptake, water retention, and disease resistance, leading to increased crop yields and farmer income. Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Pseudomonas oryzihabitans , Pseudomonas otitidis , Bacillus subtilis , Bacillus brevis , Bacillus cereus , Bacillus circulars , Bacillus firmus , and Bacillus licheniformis  are widely used for plant growth promotion (Nagrale et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, in aquaculture, biofloc systems use bacterial biofilm to maintain water quality, recycle nutrients, and support the growth of fish and shrimp populations (El-Sayed, 2021 ). These systems promote sustainable aquaculture practices, contribute to food security, and create economic opportunities for fish farmers, aligning with SDG 8. In the industrial sector, bacterial biofilm drive innovation and infrastructure development (SDG 9) through their applications in bioremediation, bioenergy production, and biomanufacturing processes. Thus, the bacteria biofilm aims to target 9.1. For instance, biofilm-forming bacterial consortia are employed in bioremediation technologies to degrade pollutants and detoxify contaminated environments. Dehalococcoides  spp. is used in the bioremediation of chlorinated solvents, and Pseudomonas putida  is engaged in the degradation of hydrocarbons in oil spills (Ruikar and Pawar, 2022 ). Moreover, bacterial biofilm plays a crucial role in bioenergy production, contributing to sustainable energy sources and infrastructure development (Logan et al., 2019 ). In the biomanufacturing sector, bacterial biofilm serves as a platform for producing value-added products, including enzymes, bio-based materials, and pharmaceuticals. Biofilm-based applications include the production of enzymes such as cellulases and amylases for industrial applications and the synthesis of biopolymers like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) for biodegradable plastics. Thus, the applications of bacterial biofilm in agriculture and industry contribute to Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8) by enhancing productivity, creating employment opportunities, and promoting economic resilience. Simultaneously, these innovations drive Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9) by fostering technological advancements, promoting sustainable practices, and supporting infrastructure development.  6.6 Biofilm helps in carbon sequestration and mitigating climate change: climate action (SDG 13) Bacterial biofilm plays a crucial role in carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. These bacterial communities are ubiquitous in natural environments and are involved in various processes that contribute to carbon cycling and storage, aligning with the goals of SDG 13 targeting 13.2. The bacterial biofilm aids in carbon sequestration through their role in soil carbon storage (Mandal et al., 2021 ). The biofilm-forming soil bacteria significantly stabilize organic carbon compounds in soil aggregates. This biofilm protects organic matter from enzyme decomposition and promotes its accumulation in soil, thus sequestering carbon over long periods. For example, the biofilm formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa  facilitates the formation of stable soil aggregates and enhances the retention of organic carbon, thereby contributing to soil carbon storage (Costa et al., 2018 ). Moreover, bacterial biofilm plays a pivotal role in carbon sequestration in aquatic environments by mediating carbon flux between the water and sediments. Bacterial biofilm on the surface of marine substrates facilitates the uptake and assimilation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), effectively removing carbon from the water column and incorporating it into microbial biomass or sedimentary organic matter (Carlson and Hansell, 2015 ). Moreover, biofilm promotes the precipitation of CaCO3  minerals, further enhancing carbon storage in aquatic sediments. Various marine biofilm-forming bacteria such as Bacillus cereus , Bacillus subtilis , Lysinibacillus  sp., Burkholderia multivorans , and Burkholderia cepacia  promote carbonate mineralization through their ureolytic activity, contributing to carbon sequestration in marine ecosystems (Zhao et al., 2021 ). Further, bacterial biofilm contributes to carbon sequestration in marine environments by forming and maintaining coral reefs. Coral reefs are formed by the accumulation of CaCO3  skeletons secreted by corals, which are facilitated by symbiotic biofilm-forming bacteria within coral biofilm (Bang et al., 2018 ). The bacteria in the family Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes primarily help in long-term carbon sequestration in coral reef ecosystems. In addition to carbon sequestration, biofilm contributes to climate change mitigation by influencing greenhouse gas dynamics in various environments. Biofilm-forming methanotrophic bacteria, including Methylococcus capsulatus , Methylosinus trichosporium , and Methylocystis parvus,  oxidize methane in wetland soils and aquatic sediments, reducing methane emissions to the atmosphere (Chowdhury and Dick, 2013 ). This biofilm contains methane-oxidizing bacteria that utilize methane as a carbon and energy source, converting it into CO2 , a less potent greenhouse gas. By reducing methane emissions, methanotrophic biofilm-forming bacteria play a crucial role in mitigating climate change and reducing the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Furthermore, bacterial biofilm contributes to the cycling of other greenhouse gases, such as N2 O and CO2,  in various ecosystems. Nitrifying and denitrifying biofilm-forming bacteria Nitrosomonas oligotropha , Nitrosospira multiformis , and Pseudomonas denitrificans  respectively, in soils and aquatic sediments regulate the production and consumption of nitrous oxide by mediating the processes of nitrification and denitrification (Zhao et al., 2022 ). Similarly, bacterial biofilm in agricultural systems can enhance soil carbon sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through biofilm-based composting, which promotes the decomposition of organic waste materials and the retention of carbon in soil aggregates. In conclusion, bacterial biofilm plays a multifaceted role in carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation, contributing to the objectives of Climate Action (SDG 13). Bacterial biofilm facilitates carbon storage in soils, aquatic sediments, and marine ecosystems while reducing greenhouse gas emissions through their diverse metabolic activities and interactions with the environment. Thus, understanding and harnessing the capabilities of bacterial biofilm can contribute to developing strategies for climate change mitigation and promoting sustainable ecosystems.  6.7 Bacterial biofilm restores marine and aquatic ecosystem: life below water (SDG 14) Bacterial biofilm is intricate communities of marine bacteria embedded in a matrix of EPS that adhere to surfaces underwater. This biofilm plays a significant role in restoring and maintaining marine and aquatic ecosystems, aligning with the goals of SDG 14 with the aim to fulfill the target of both 14.1 and 14.2. Bacterial biofilm contributes to the health and resilience of aquatic habitats worldwide through their diverse metabolic activities and interactions with the environment. In marine environments, biofilm thrives in different environmental settings like ports, coasts, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and the open ocean, each contributing to ecological processes like nutrient cycling and sediment stabilization while facing distinct environmental challenges. The significant contribution of bacterial biofilm to marine and aquatic ecosystems is their involvement in nutrient cycling. Biofilm is a hotspot of microbial activity, facilitating the transformation and recycling of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and ammonia (Chen et al., 2022 ). The nitrogen-fixing bacteria, including Rhizobium leguminosarum , Azotobacter  spp., and Clostridium pasteurianum,  produced biofilm, which helps convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium, used by various marine organisms (Singh et al., 2023 ). Similarly, denitrifying bacteria such as Pseudomonas denitrificans  produced biofilm that removes excess nitrogen from the water by converting NO3 −  into N2 , thereby mitigating eutrophication and promoting water quality (Wang and Chu, 2016 ). Eutrophication occurs when excessive nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, are present in the water bodies. Excess nutrients lead to plant growth on the water surfaces, reduced O2  levels, and altered species composition. In nutrient-rich environments, biofilm-forming nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Azotobacter  spp. increased nitrogen availability promotes algal and plant growth and exacerbates eutrophication (Pittol et al., 2016 ). Thus, bacterial biofilm promotes algal bloom formation by providing surfaces for algal attachment, colonization, and development. Furthermore, bacterial biofilm plays a crucial role in bioremediation of contaminated wastewater. Bacterial biofilm is highly efficient at degrading a wide range of organic and inorganic pollutants in the wastewater discharged from domestic, industrial, and agricultural sources. The biofilm-forming aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Pseudomonas  spp., Bacillus  spp., and Mycobacterium  spp. degrade organic pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, and industrial chemicals through metabolic pathways like biodegradation and mineralization (Mohapatra et al., 2022 ). Inorganic contaminants like heavy metals can also be immobilized and detoxified by biofilm-forming bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Alcaligenes faecalis , Marinobacter  spp., and Burkholderia cepacia  through processes like biosorption, bioprecipitation, biomineralization, bioaccumulation, and biotransformation (Yadav and Chandra, 2020 ). Several hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, including Staphylococcus saprophyticus , Bacillus amyloliquefaciens , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Pseudomonas furukawaii  formed biofilm on the surface of the oil particles and thereby break down oil spills and other petroleum-based pollutants, reducing their harmful effects on marine life (Mahto et al., 2022b ). Biofilm-forming bacteria in marine environments can effectively degrade pollutants like heavy metals and hydrocarbons, aiding in marine bioremediation and environmental clean-up (Priyadarshanee and Das, 2021 ). A quantitative evaluation of in-situ bioremediation in the Bohai Sea, China, showed significant improvements in compound pollution, with bacteria achieving up to 68% reduction in PAHs and a 73% decrease in heavy metals after 210 days (Wang et al., 2020 ). Bacterial biofilm also helps in microplastic degradation by colonizing and adhering to microplastic surfaces, leading to physical and chemical degradation. For example, biofilm-forming plastic-degrading bacteria like Pseudomonas  spp., Shewenella  spp., Vibrio alginolyticus , Rhodococcus  sp., Streptococcus nigra , and Bacillus  spp. can produce enzymes that break down the polymer chains of microplastic, facilitating their degradation into smaller, less harmful fragments (Malla et al., 2023 ). In-situ bioremediation of Malaysian mangrove soil contaminated with PET and PS microplastic, using an indigenous microbial consortium, achieved an 18% reduction in microplastic in 90 days through biofilm formation. The process also altered soil composition, increasing Si, S, and Fe while decreasing C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Cl, and K (Auta et al., 2022 ). In addition to nutrient cycling and bioremediation, bacterial biofilm contributes to the formation and maintenance of essential habitats such as coral reefs and estuarine ecosystems. Bacterial biofilm is the pioneer organisms in these habitats, providing substrate for the attachment and growth of diverse marine organisms. For example, biofilm on coral reefs facilitates the settlement of coral larvae and promotes reef accretion. The biofilm-forming bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Serratia macrescens , Enterobacter  sp., and Pantoea dispersa  also stabilize the sediment of the mangrove forest and thereby support the growth of mangrove seedlings (Rath and Dangar, 2014 ). Further, these biofilm-forming bacteria with plant growth-promoting traits can enhance mangrove ecosystem resilience by improving plant and soil health, aiding in nutrient cycling, stress resistance, and pollutant degradation (Panda and Das, 2024 ). A recent study describes the role of EPS in metal sequestration during mangrove restoration (Cheng et al., 2022 ). Similarly, in estuaries and seagrass meadows, biofilm-forming bacteria improve nutrient cycling and stabilize sediments (De Carvalho, 2018 ). Moreover, bacterial biofilm plays a symbiotic relationship with other marine organisms. For instance, marine bacteria produce biofilm on the surfaces of other marine animals, such as sponges, corals, and shellfish, which serve as a source of nutrition and protection (Wahl et al., 2012 ). This biofilm provides a rich source of organic matter for filter-feeding organisms and enhances the immune response of host organisms against pathogens. The bacterial biofilm is involved in carbon cycling in marine and aquatic ecosystems. Through processes such as photosynthesis and respiration, biofilm influences the flux of carbon between the atmosphere, water, and sediments. Thiobacillus ferrooxidans  and Synechococcus  spp. produced biofilm that fixes CO2  into organic carbon through photosynthesis, thereby supporting the growth of higher trophic levels in aquatic food webs (Nivetha et al., 2023 ). Thus, bacterial biofilm serves as producers and sources of organic matter in marine food webs, supporting trophic transfer and energy flow to higher trophic levels. The organic matter produced by bacterial biofilm undergoes trophic transfer through various pathways, ultimately supporting the growth and reproduction of higher organisms in aquatic ecosystems. The bacterial biofilm also plays a critical role in decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients in marine and aquatic ecosystems. The bacteria produced biofilm on the submerged surfaces such as rocks, sediments, and detritus, which helps to break down complex organic compounds into simpler forms through enzymatic degradation. This process releases nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the water, where primary producers and other organisms can utilize them. Furthermore, bacterial biofilm contributes to the resilience of marine and aquatic ecosystems in the face of environmental stressors such as pollution, climate change, and disease outbreaks. Biofilm provides a protective microenvironment for bacterial populations, enhancing their ability to tolerate and adapt to changing environmental conditions (Parrilli et al., 2022 ). Thus, bacterial biofilm plays a crucial role in restoring and maintaining marine and aquatic ecosystems, supporting the objectives of Life Below Water (SDG 14). Bacterial biofilm contributes to nutrient cycling, bioremediation, habitat formation, symbiotic relationships, carbon cycling, decomposition, and ecosystem resilience through diverse metabolic activities and environmental interactions. Understanding and harnessing the capabilities of bacterial biofilm helps to protect and sustainably manage marine and aquatic resources for future generations.  6.8 Bacterial biofilm aids in soil conservation, erosion prevention, and biodiversity preservation: life on land (SDG 15) Soil is vital to terrestrial ecosystems, supporting plant growth, regulating water flow, and sustaining biodiversity. However, soil degradation, erosion, and biodiversity loss pose significant threats to land ecosystems worldwide. Bacterial biofilm plays a crucial role in soil conservation, erosion prevention, and biodiversity preservation, thereby contributing to the objectives of SDG 15. Soil conservation involves protecting and conserving soil resources to maintain productivity and ecological functions. Bacterial biofilm contributes to soil conservation through several mechanisms, including soil aggregation and nutrient cycling (Ahmad et al., 2017 ). Bacterial biofilm produces EPS, which binds soil particles together, forming stable aggregates (Costa et al., 2018 ). These aggregates improve soil structure, water infiltration, and nutrient retention, reducing erosion, surface runoff, and loss of topsoil. The biofilm-forming bacteria, including Bacillus cereus , Bacillus subtilis , Bacillus amylolequifaciens , Alcaligenes faecalis , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  helps to aggregate soil particles, thereby preventing soil erosion and promoting soil stabilization (Deka et al., 2019 ). Moreover, bacterial biofilm helps in nutrient cycling within the soil ecosystem. They decompose organic matter, fix atmospheric nitrogen, and mineralize nutrients, making them available to plants and other organisms. For instance, biofilm-forming nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium leguminosarum  form symbiotic associations with leguminous plants, enhancing nitrogen availability in the soil and promoting plant growth (Goyal et al., 2021 ). Thus, the biofilm-forming bacteria play critical roles in nutrient cycling, decomposition, and soil health. Soil erosion is a widespread problem that leads to the loss of fertile topsoil, decreased soil productivity, and degradation of ecosystems. Bacterial biofilm contributes to erosion prevention by forming biofilm mat formation, root adherence, and biopolymer production. The bacterial biofilm forms cohesive mats or crusts on the soil surface as physical barriers to wind and water erosion. These biofilm mats stabilize the soil particles and reduce the impact of erosive forces, protecting the soil from erosion. Bacillus subtilis  and Sporosarcina pasteurii  produced biofilm on arid soils, preventing wind erosion and desertification (Chen et al., 2021a ,b ,c ; Fattahi et al., 2021 ). Bacterial biofilm thus adheres to the surface of plant roots and forms a protective layer around them, stabilizing the soil and preventing root damage from erosion. This symbiotic relationship between plants and biofilm enhances soil stability and reduces the soil erosion risk. Pseudomonas aeruginosa  colonizes around plant roots and improves plant growth (Gupta et al., 2020 ). In addition, it helps to increase soil aggregation and stability, thereby reducing erosion in agricultural and natural ecosystems. Moreover, biofilm-forming bacteria produced biopolymers such as exopolysaccharides and PHAs, which bind soil particles together and enhance soil stability (Reddy et al., 2022 ). Thus, these biopolymers improve soil structure, reduce surface runoff, and prevent soil erosion. Bacterial biofilm contributes to biodiversity preservation in terrestrial ecosystems. Hence, bacterial biofilm helps in soil conservation, erosion prevention, and biodiversity preservation in terrestrial ecosystems. Bacterial biofilm contributes to the sustainable management and conservation of land resources by promoting soil stability, reducing erosion, and enhancing biodiversity, aligning with the objectives of Life on Land SDG 15, achieving target 15.3.   7 Gaps, challenges, and opportunities The sustainable approach involving bacterial biofilm has been a promising strategy for the remediation and ecorestoration of stressed environments. However, despite having a wide range of advantageous and imperative applications, their real-time use is circumscribed due to various factors. The inefficacy of biofilm-mediated bioremediation in alleviating environmental stress can be attributed to several reasons. Low abundance of indigenous biofilm-forming bacterial populations, inadequate nutrient availability, and reduced bioavailability of pollutants to bacteria often retards the bioremediation efficiency. Biological mechanisms governing the remediation process might be affected by fluctuations in abiotic parameters such as salinity, pH, and temperature, which further leads to decelerated biofilm formation, reduced metal binding potential, and Na+  uptake (Bhatt et al., 2020 ). Indeed, the biofilm-assisted bioremediation rate is slow compared to conventional chemical treatment methods. Degradation of recalcitrant compounds by bacterial biofilm often produces harmful metabolic products, further contaminating the environment, making this biological approach suitable for modest pollutant loads and cases where immediate recovery is unnecessary (Sharma et al., 2020 ). Due to the coexistence of numerous heavy metals and metal-metal interactions taking place among them, the efficiency of metal carbonate precipitation mediated by biofilm may be impacted (Chen et al., 2021a ,b ,c ). Restoring marine environments with biofilm technology faces several challenges. The complexity and variability of marine ecosystems, such as fluctuating temperatures, salinity, fluid velocity, and viscosity of marine water, and turbulence created by organic matter can impact biofilm stability and effectiveness (Sonawane et al., 2022 ). Biofilm of rapidly proliferating bacteria cannot be used in remediation by biofilm reactors due to their low machine stability and reactor capacity dependence on dispersed O2  (Mitra and Mukhopadhyay, 2016 ). Despite several limitations in a real-time application, bacterial biofilm is still considered a potential elicitor for eco-restoration due to its cost-effectiveness and a higher degree of sustainability. Several studies are continuously being conducted to design appropriate modules for improved biofilm-forming strains. An innovative method of bioremediation has been formulated, which uses DNA-harbouring catabolic genes in biofilm to mimic natural processes of transformation that promote the biodegradation of specific contaminants. The biodegradation process can be further enhanced by the horizontal transfer of potent pollutant biodegrading genes from genetically modified bacteria to biofilm-forming bacterial populations. However, there is a lot of debate and disagreement about the release and application of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) in nature; hence, their commercialization is a challenge, and the assessment of potential risks associated with the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in field application should be considered (Saxena et al., 2020 ). Cell-to-cell interactions and QS might play a vital role in governing the degradation potential of bacterial biofilm, and further investigation is needed (Yadav and Chandra, 2020 ). Genetic to metabolite multi-omics techniques offer a comprehensive understanding of biofilm biology, including studying transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolites, which also investigate the mechanisms behind biofilm traits. A multitude of data regarding biofilm resistance, phenotypic variations between planktonic and biofilm cells, interactions between biofilm and recalcitrant, and other biological alterations taking place in a biofilm system would be available through omics techniques (Mishra et al., 2022 ). Therefore, biofilm research is an emerging field of study in sustainable development that could offer additional metabolic power for biological remediation technologies and examine the survival methods of bacteria.  8 Conclusion Biofilm and their EPS matrix play a crucial role in enhancing bacterial adaptability and resilience towards various environmental pollutants. The intricate interaction between TCS, QS and c-di-GMP signaling molecules governs the biofilm development, which also provides protection against external stressors, ensuring their survival under adverse conditions. These unique biofilm features render it a suitable mode for carrying out degradation process, positioning bacterial biofilm applications as a sustainable approach for environmental remediation. Biofilm-forming bacteria employ variable remediation mechanisms, which offer significant benefits in enhancing the soil, air, and water quality. Bacterial exopolysaccharides contain negatively charged functional groups which interact with the ions, heavy metals, and toxic soil aggregates, leading to their entrapment and removal, thereby facilitating soil restoration. Moreover, establishing bacterial biofilm as biofilters in bioreactors sequesters the air pollutants (VOCs, NOx, and SOx), followed by their degradation. While hydrophobic VOCs are removed by biosorption, other gaseous pollutants are mitigated by chemical oxidation or reduction process. Additionally, enzymes from biofilm metabolize the complex organic pollutants such as hydrocarbons, oil spills, and microplastic present in the wastewater, thus supporting aquatic ecosystem health. Biofilm-based bioreactors effectively treat industrial and domestic wastewater by undergoing various aerobic and anaerobic fermentations. Biofilm, as a mode of growth, provides a wide range of applications in biodiversity conservation and environmental clean-up. Therefore, bacterial biofilm emerges as a promising strategy for addressing different goals of SDGs. Further research and field-based studies are necessary to understand and optimize the commercial viability of biofilm-based interventions for widespread application in ecosystem restoration initiatives.
