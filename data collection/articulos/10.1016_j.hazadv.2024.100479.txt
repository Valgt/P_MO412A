                  Using chemical fertilizers extensively in small farms has helped increase crop yields, supporting food security and economic growth. However, recent studies show that these fertilizers are often used inefficiently and inconsistently. This leads to environmental harm, unbalanced soil nutrients, and lower-quality food production. These issues threaten food security, which is vital for human survival and may lead to the abandonment of arable land. This situation calls for a significant shift in soil conservation research to better connect scientific findings with practical conservation methods, ensuring that agricultural progress goes hand in hand with environmental sustainability. Effective use of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers is vital for both environmental sustainability and food security. Correcting nutritional imbalances, especially the disrupted N/P ratio caused by faulty fertilization practices, is key to ensuring a balanced nutrient supply. These imbalances have a substantial effect on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, altering their functionality, biodiversity and human nutrition Therefore, adopting balanced fertilization techniques is essential to combine environmental sustainability with global food security and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).To optimize nutrient consumption and production efficiency, regulations should be enacted to enforce the 4R principle, which involves applying the right nutrient source at the appropriate rate, time, method and location. This article emphasizes the connections between current agricultural practices, land use, fertilizer application, soil degradation, and future challenges. It promotes environmentally friendly farming methods that recognize the vital links between soil quality, food security, human health, and environmental sustainability.

Using chemical fertilizers extensively in small farms has helped increase crop yields, supporting food security and economic growth. However, recent studies show that these fertilizers are often used inefficiently and inconsistently. This leads to environmental harm, unbalanced soil nutrients, and lower-quality food production. These issues threaten food security, which is vital for human survival and may lead to the abandonment of arable land. This situation calls for a significant shift in soil conservation research to better connect scientific findings with practical conservation methods, ensuring that agricultural progress goes hand in hand with environmental sustainability. Effective use of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers is vital for both environmental sustainability and food security. Correcting nutritional imbalances, especially the disrupted N/P ratio caused by faulty fertilization practices, is key to ensuring a balanced nutrient supply. These imbalances have a substantial effect on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, altering their functionality, biodiversity and human nutrition Therefore, adopting balanced fertilization techniques is essential to combine environmental sustainability with global food security and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).To optimize nutrient consumption and production efficiency, regulations should be enacted to enforce the 4R principle, which involves applying the right nutrient source at the appropriate rate, time, method and location. This article emphasizes the connections between current agricultural practices, land use, fertilizer application, soil degradation, and future challenges. It promotes environmentally friendly farming methods that recognize the vital links between soil quality, food security, human health, and environmental sustainability.

However, intensifying food production on existing farmland poses significant challenges due to soil degradation, biodiversity loss, increased carbon emissions, resource limitations and sustainability concerns. The intensification of fertilization to attain higher yields has led to increasing global concerns, such as nutrient imbalances in cultivated fields and leaching into the environment (water bodies), with associated implications (Tyagi et al., 2022 ). These issues pose risks to both carbon reserves and biodiversity, particularly in highly productive croplands (Kastner et al., 2021 ). Also, the escalating cost of fertilizers further exacerbates geopolitical and economic issues, especially affecting food security in underdeveloped countries (Aryal et al., 2022 ). To address these challenges, we need to adopt various technologies, such as optimized fertilizer use and efficient nutrient management, which improve fertilizer use efficiency, boosting crop yields and ensuring global food security. (Zhang et al., 2020 ). Fertilizers are vital inputs for enhancing agricultural productivity by replenishing soil nutrients, also pose notable toxicity risks to humans and the environment (Hossain et al., 2022 ). These risks are elevated by excessive synthetic use, the presence of toxic elements and improper application intervals (Nadarajan and Sukumaran, 2021 ). In light of key challenges like climate change and land degradation, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) emphasize the need for holistic approaches to achieve food security (SDG 2), biodiversity (SDG 15), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and climate action (SDG 13) by enhancing land productivity, improving water management, and promoting climate change adaptation and mitigation (Henderson and Loreau, 2023 ). Recognizing their interconnectedness, judicious fertilizer use is essential for sustainable agriculture. It plays a key role in meeting the needs of a growing population while addressing environmental challenges, ensuring food security and promoting global sustainability. (Atapattu et al., 2024 ). Despite progress in scientific knowledge and local practices, ongoing soil degradation and the limitations of current programs continue to be major challenges (Nazir et al., 2024 ). Though the Green Revolution alleviated food scarcity, it also intensified the global reliance on synthetic fertilizers, resulting in widespread environmental contamination and health risks (Soria-Lopez et al., 2023 ). This reliance has not only degraded soils but also increased heavy metal levels in plants, reducing crop nutritional quality (Nadarajan and Sukumaran, 2021 ). Recent assessments by the IPCC have emphasized that the production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers consumes 2 % of global energy (Menegat et al., 2022 ) and is a significant source of non-CO2  greenhouse gases, contributing to emissions of nitrous oxide (N2 O), methane (CH4 ), and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Notably, agriculture is responsible for over 80 % of N2 O emissions and 70 % of ammonia (NH3 ) emissions (Song et al., 2020 ). Although synthetic fertilizers have boosted agricultural productivity, their environmental and human impacts raise concerns about their sustainability (Nadarajan and Sukumaran, 2021 ). Over the past century, global land and soil deterioration has persisted due to unsustainable land use, deforestation, and climate change, with pronounced effects in developing nations, potentially escalating conflict, and population displacement (Prăvălie, 2021 ). The projected annual global economic losses from land degradation are estimated to be between 18 and 20 trillion USD (UNCCD, 2019 ). In response to these challenges, the UN has prioritized combating land degradation, striving for Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) by 2030, in alignment with SDG 15.3. This goal emphasizes implementing land management practices that prevent the loss of healthy land while enhancing productivity (SDSN, 2015 ). Healthy agricultural soils are crucial for supporting food and crop production; meeting human needs and providing ecosystem services that contribute to quality living and biodiversity conservation. Wang and Hooks (2011)  identified six key soil health characteristics (Fig. 1  ). Understanding soil nutrient composition is crucial for evaluating its capacity to support plant growth and maintaining agricultural productivity to feed a 10 billion population by 2050 (Wang et al., 2024 ; Keteku et al., 2024 ). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) advocates for a sustainable food system that prioritizes food safety and nutrition at every stage, from production to consumption (Mrabet, 2023 ). This approach is designed to promote justice by protecting the interests of all stakeholders and enhancing the overall quality of life. It focuses on creating profitable, resource-efficient food systems while ensuring cost-effective production to minimize energy consumption (Lee et al., 2023 ). However, numerous factors contribute to food insecurity, including the availability of food, purchasing power, delivery challenges, poverty, disasters, violence, and geopolitical complexities (Onyeaka et al., 2022 ). Achieving global food security is further complicated by the dynamics of global trade shaped by globalization (Mrabet, 2023 ). Ejiohuo et al. (2024)  and Onyeaka et al. (2024)  stressed that to tackle the complex relationship between food insecurity and mental health, we need to include food security in mental health plans. This means working together across different fields, making systemic changes and using various methods to ensure everyone has fair access to nutritious food, which supports overall health and global development. Therefore, meeting the growing food demand resulting from global population growth necessitates a careful evaluation of diverse agricultural systems and the adoption of sustainable practices. To protect natural, economic, and social resources, collaboration across various fields is crucial. This involves environmental and social scientists, civil society, sustainable businesses, and policymakers working together. (Bowser et al., 2024 ). People are becoming more aware of how soil degradation is connected to problems like food security, loss of biodiversity, environmental issues, social unrest, poverty, and conflict. This shows how important soils are for achieving the SDGs (Basset, 2024 ). Addressing these challenges demands a transformative approach to soil conservation, which is vital for ensuring global socio-ecosystem sustainability (Bowser et al., 2024 ). Understanding the fertilizer-soil-agriculture dynamic is essential for shaping effective food policies. Through this review, we address the consequences of rising fertilizer prices, and usage, encompassing environmental pollution, and its impact on food and nutritional security, with a primary emphasis on India. To minimize and adapt to human-induced changes in N, P and K stocks, cycles, and stoichiometry resulting from fertilizer usage, this review examines the causes, interactions, and implications for both present and future situations. Our goal is to promote a global view that links human, fertilizer use with potential environmental benefits, food and nutritional security, and improved environmental quality. In addition to providing sustainable techniques, the review explores the usage of fertilizers, soil health, and food policy. It also shows how important balanced fertilizer practices are for both society and the economy in shaping global food policy. This discussion supports a complete, integrated approach that connects soil health, food security, and human health. It aligns with global sustainability goals and encourages practical, innovative solutions for a strong and resilient future.  2 Selection of literature For this comprehensive review, we initially retrieved 543 research articles and book chapters, followed by a rigorous selection process. The keywords used to identify these publications included fertilizer use, soil health, balanced fertilization, food security, nutrition and conservation practices. To refine our focus, we first excluded research articles that did not cover balanced fertilization, soil health, or food security, narrowing our selection to 194 publications. We then applied specific criteria, selecting papers that empirically documented changes in soil quality, soil degradation and management strategies, the impact of chemical fertilizers on soil health and food security, fertilizer policies, and the enhancement of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties via conservative agricultural practices. This further narrowed our selection to 198 papers. After eliminating duplicates and studies lacking relevant baselines or crucial parameter quantification, we chose 126 papers for thorough analysis. Fig. 2   presents a Venn diagram illustrating the number of studies shared among four key topics: fertilizer usage and policies, conventional farming approaches, problems in conventional practices and synergistic farming solutions from various regions.  3 The threat of soil degradation to future food security: A focus on India Soil degradation, often described as a global "pandemic," manifests in various forms such as erosion, salinization, acidity and compaction, all of which pose significant threats like land loss and reduced agricultural output (Pinto et al., 2023 ). Globally, about 25 % of land is degraded, contributing to the release of soil carbon and nitrous oxide, both of which are major contributors to climate change (Jones et al., 2023 ). Irrational agricultural practices are the primary drivers of this degradation, leading to the loss of 24 billion tonnes of soil annually. If current trends persist, it is projected that 95 % of Earth's regions could be degraded by 2050 (Hossain et al., 2022 ). The acceleration of land degradation, particularly in recent decades, is largely due to anthropogenic activities, with Asia being the most affected continent, spanning 747 million hectares of degraded land. In contrast, North America has the least amount of degraded land, with only 96 million hectares impacted, as depicted in Fig. 3  , which represents the global status of land degradation. In India, the dense population and limited land resources have led to significant erosional losses, endangering food security and livelihoods. The urgent adoption of sustainable soil management practices is necessary, as ongoing soil deterioration forces farmers to expand into marginal or forested lands, which requires substantial investments (Wani, 2021 ). Evaluating the quality of cultivated is vital, especially in impoverished regions where food security is closely linked to poverty, as highlighted by the FAO (Debnath et al., 2021 ). Addressing soil degradation is especially urgent in the context of climate change, which may impact agriculture and soil health differently across regions. Fig. 4   illustrates the extent of land degradation in India, as estimated by several organisations. In agriculture, diminishing soil capacity limits actual yields compared to potential yields (Wani, 2021 ). Land scarcity, along with industrialization, urban expansion, shrinking farm sizes, changing dietary habits and pollution from emerging contaminants, intensifies competition for limited quality land and water resources. As rising food demands strain these finite resources, the declining quantity and quality of land become increasingly concerning (Maja and Ayano, 2021 ). Soil quality assessments often concentrate on essential nutrient deficiencies (Zn, B, S, N, P) crucial for crop yield (Kihara et al., 2020 ). Soybean-producing regions have faced significant sulphur shortages following a shift from single super phosphate (SSP) to di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), driven largely by nitrogenous fertilizer subsidies (Maja and Ayano, 2021 ). This transition, influenced by cost-efficient nutrient sources, highlights the challenge of balancing soil health with economic considerations. Restoring heavily farmed areas is critical for ensuring national food security, aligning with SDG 15, which prioritizes the protection of terrestrial ecosystems, managing forests, and the reversal of land degradation (United Nations, 2015 ). The connection between soil quality, human health, and ecosystem services is increasingly evident (Mrabet, 2023 ). India, ranking 101st in the Global Hunger Index 2021, faces severe malnutrition concerns, with 15.3 % of its population (208.6 million) affected, accounting for over 30 % of the global malnourished population (683.9 million) (FAO, 2021 ). Nutrient deficiencies, combined with excessive fat and grain consumption, and widespread poverty, contribute to India's ongoing malnutrition crisis. Nitrogen- deficient soils particularly challenge the production of plant-based proteins, which are rich in nitrogen (about 16 % % N). Despite increased fertilizer use, only 14% of fertilizer N is consumed in a vegetarian diet and a mere 4 % in a non-vegetarian diet (Singh et al., 2023 ). India's reliance on cereals exacerbates micronutrient deficiencies post the green revolution. The vulnerability of soil degradation varies depending on agricultural practices and environmental factors, impacting different soils, regions, and crops in diverse ways. Climate change exacerbates the effects of erosion by increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (Hossain et al., 2022 ). The uncertainty surrounding future erosion impacts highlights the urgent need for research and monitoring to better understand erosion dynamics and implement effective interventions (Guimarães et al., 2024 ). Soil compaction, primarily caused by heavy machinery and excessive ploughing, poses a significant threat to global agriculture (Jayaraman and Dalal, 2022 ). The decline in organic fertilizer use exacerbates this issue, leading to poor aeration, increased soil strength, drainage problems, erosion, and overall degradation (Mileusnić et al., 2022 ). Compacted soils exhibit altered structure, reduced pore space, and increased bulk density, which impedes water availability, nutrient uptake, and crop growth, thereby necessitating more energy for cultivation. Modern farming practices, characterized by larger fields and heavier equipment, further exacerbate this concern (Weeraratna, 2022 ).  4 Global situation of fertilizers with an emphasis on India Fertilizers, whether natural or synthetic, are chemical-based materials used to enhance plant growth and fertility (Maximum Yield Inc., 2018 ). These include synthetic products like urea and naturally occurring minerals such as phosphate rock and potassium chloride, all of which provide essential nutrients necessary for plant growth. Derived from raw materials found in nature, fertilizers undergo processing to improve their usability, thereby supplementing soil nutrients to meet the demands of crop yields (Pinto et al., 2023 ). The global fertilizer and mineral sector encompass activities such as mining, manufacturing, distribution, and trading, all aimed at ensuring the availability of sufficient primary and secondary minerals for agriculture. However, the excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus has surpassed planetary limits, causing severe eutrophication despite their benefits in increasing crop yields (Randive et al., 2021 ). To address this, it has been proposed that nitrogen and phosphorus applications should be limited to 62 million tonnes and 6.2 million tonnes annually, respectively. Yet, current estimates indicate that consumption is around 150 million and 14 million tonnes, respectively, with these figures steadily rising, thereby posing significant environmental risks (Huygens et al., 2020 ). The availability of fertilizer minerals worldwide is influenced by various geological, structural, and climatic factors, resulting in diverse global reserves (Randive et al., 2021 ). For instance, Russia emerged as the top producer of complete NPK fertilizers in 2019, marking a 5.2 % increase from 2018. China leads the world in nitrogen fertilizer production, followed by India, the United States, and Russia, with Egypt leading in consumption (Mankunnummal, 2023 ). Notably, Nigeria exhibited the highest annual growth rates in nitrogen fertilizer output and consumption in 2019 (FAO, 2020 ). Phosphate rock, a key source of phosphate fertilisers, is abundant, especially in Morocco and the Western Sahara, which together hold 72 % of global reserves. China also leads in phosphorus fertilizer production, followed by the United States, India, Russia, and Morocco (USGS, 2019 ). In 2018, global potash reserves totalled 5.8 billion tonnes, primarily held by Russia (34.3 %) and Canada (20.6 %). The top producers in 2019 were Canada, Russia, and Belarus, contributing 26 %, 19 %, and 16 % of global output, respectively. Canada's output surged by 18.6 % from 2017 to 2018, underscoring the industry's substantial annual contribution of 23 billion USD to the national economy (FAO, 2020 ). 4.1 India's position in the fertilizer market Over the past five decades, India's fertilizer sector has expanded significantly, positioning the country as the second-largest global consumer and the third-largest producer of fertilizers (Bishnoi et al., 2020 ). As of 2022–2023, India produced approximately 31.1 million metric tons (MMT) of fertilizers, including urea, diammonium phosphate (DAP), and muriate of potash (MOP). This marks a substantial increase compared to earlier decades, reflecting the remarkable growth from around 0.067 MMT in 1951–1952 to the current levels (The fertilizer association of India, 2023 ). By 2025, India is expected to require 30–35 million tonnes of NPK from fertilizer minerals, alongside 10 million tonnes from organic and bio-fertilizer sources, to fulfil its minimum food requirement of 300 million tonnes (Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, 2019 ). While India produces 80 % of its own urea, it remains heavily dependent on imports for phosphate and potassic fertilizers (FAO, 2019 ). The lack of sufficient mineral raw materials for phosphates has hindered India's ability to achieve self-sufficiency, with indigenous rock phosphate supply meeting only 5–10 % of the overall P2 O5  requirements (Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, 2015 ). Additionally, the entire potash demand, both for direct application and complex fertilizer production, is met through imports, as domestic raw material supply is almost entirely reliant on foreign sources (IBM, 2020 ).  4.2 Status of Indian soils The Soil Health Card (SHC) project, initiated in 2014–15 by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, India aimed to assess soil health indicators and provide farmers with detailed soil health cards. Throughout Cycle 1 (2015–16 to 2016–17) and Cycle 2 (2017–18 to 2018–19), approximately 5.27 crore soil samples were analysed, and around 19.64 lakh examinations were conducted under the Model Village Programme scheme. The results from across India reveal that Indian soils are degrading (Gorain et al., 2024 ). Most soils show significant deficiencies in organic carbon and macronutrients, commonly classified as "very low," "low," or "medium." Specifically, about 85 % of Model Village Programme soil samples are deficient in organic carbon, with 15 % rated as extremely low, 49 % as low, and 21 % as medium. Furthermore, 97 % of samples are deficient in nitrogen, with 45 % extremely low, 36 % low, and 16 % medium. Similarly, 83 % of samples are deficient in phosphorus, with 17 % extremely low, 31 % low, and 35 % medium levels. Potassium deficiencies are observed in 71 % of samples, with 5 % extremely low, 14 % low, and 52 % medium levels. Micronutrient deficiencies vary, with boron, iron, sulphur, and zinc more common than copper and manganese deficiencies. Addressing these deficiencies is crucial for enhancing soil fertility and crop productivity (Kuldip et al., 2021 ). Chemical fertilizer usage and nutrient deficit in soils of India India, with roughly 11 % of global agricultural land, ranked as the world's second-largest consumer of chemical fertilizers in 2019, contributing approximately 15 % of global consumption. It was also the second-largest producer, accounting for 9 % of global production (Chanda et al., 2019 ). In 2020–21, India consumed 62.98 million tonnes of chemical fertilizers, excluding SSP, marking an 82.5 % increase from 2000 to 2001 (Kuldip et al., 2021 ). Urea dominated India's fertilizer usage in 2020–21, constituting 53 % of the total, followed by DAP at 19 %, complex fertilizers at 20 % and MOP at 5 %. Over the past two decades (2000–01 to 2020–21), consumption of complex fertilizers rose by 163 %, DAP by 103 %, urea by 83 %, and MOP by 92 % (Chanda et al., 2019 ). The percentage of fertilizer consumption in India from 1961 to 2021 was illustrated in Fig. 5   (World Bank Group, 2021 ). An analysis of fertilizer consumption and soil nutrient deficiencies across Indian states and union territories showed no consistent correlation. Regions with higher fertilizer usage didn't consistently exhibit fewer soil deficiencies, and vice versa, indicating that factors beyond chemical fertilizer use influence soil health (Shukla et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, research examining yield, fertilizer application, and response ratio in India's irrigated regions from 1970 to 2015 showed a significant 20 % decrease in the fertilizer response ratio, dropping from 13.4 to 2.7 (Chaudhari et al., 2015 ). This decline can be attributed in part to excessive subsidisation, which has led to an imbalanced nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) ratio of 6.5:2.8:1 in 2020–21, deviating from the ideal 4:2:1 ratio (Kuldip et al., 2021 ). Findings from the All India Coordinated Research Project on Long-Term Fertilizer Experiments suggest that prolonged use of nitrogenous fertilizers may harm soil health and crop yield, leading to deficiencies in other macro and micronutrients. Even with adequate NPK application, the lack of micronutrients and secondary nutrients can limit yield, hinder plant development, and cause physiological issues. These investigations have been ongoing at fixed locations for over 50 years (Anon, 2021a ).   4.3 India's fertiliser usage, output, and imports In 2022–23, India's total fertilizer nutrient consumption (N  + P2 O5 +K2 O) was estimated at 29.84 MMT, with notable shifts in usage patterns compared to the previous year. Nitrogen and phosphorus consumption rose by 4 % and 1.2 %, respectively, over 2021–22 levels, while potassium usage sharply declined by 32.2 % to 1.72 MMT. This decline contrasts with the predicted increases in urea and DAP consumption, which were expected to reach 35.73 MMT and 10.53 MMT reflecting growths of 4.5 % and 13.6 %, respectively, from the previous year. Consequently, the All-India NPK utilization ratio widened from 7.7:3.1:1 in 2021–22 to 11.8:4.6:1 in 2022–23. Per-hectare nutrient usage (N  + P2 O5 +K2 O) increased slightly from 141.0 kg in 2021–22 to 141.2 kg in 2022–23 (The fertilizer association of India, 2023 ). On the production front, India saw increases in fertilizer output during 2022–23, with urea production reaching 28.50 MMT, DAP at 4.35 MMT, NP/NPK complex fertilizers at 9.29 MMT, and SSP at 5.65 MMT. These figures represent respective increases of 13.6 %, 3 %, 11.9 %, and 5.5 %, over 2021–22. However, import trends varied; while DAP and NP/NPK complex fertilizer imports rose by 20.5 % and 135 %, respectively, imports of urea and MOP declined. DAP imports reached 6.58 MMT, while NP/NPK complex fertilizers jumped from 1.17 MMT to 2.75 MMT. In contrast, urea and MOP imports declined from 9.14 to 2.46 MMT in 2021–22 to 7.58 and 1.87 MMT in 2022–23, reflecting decreases of 17 % and 24.1 %, respectively (The fertilizer association of India, 2023 ). Between 1970 and 2018, Indian agriculture received 666.4 MMT of nitrogen, 189.1 MMT of phosphorus, and 244.8 MMT of potassium, with chemical fertilizers contributing 68.1 % of N, 91.3 % of P, and 28.8 % of K (Anon, 2020 ). However, the nutrient budget revealed a positive N balance (12.2 MMT), P buildup (11.7 MMT), but a significant negative K balance (157.9 MMT) over 48 years. A business-as-usual scenario predicts continued positive N balance (276.2 MMT) and P balance (20.9 MMT), but a negative K balance (202 MMT) in Indian soils by 2050. This data informs sustainable fertilizer use strategies for the future (The Fertilizer Association of India, 2023 ). Fig. 6   depicted the consumption, import, and output of chemical and organic fertilizers in India. Fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) is crucial for sustainable agriculture in India, where it supports the economy and food security. With limited arable land and a growing population, optimizing fertilizer use is vital for maximizing yields, minimizing environmental impacts, and maintaining soil health (Shukla et al., 2022 ). FUE varies across cropping systems, soil types, and climates, and improving it is essential for boosting productivity while mitigating the environmental effects of excessive fertilizer use (Kuldip et al., 2021 ). The rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains has low FUE, especially for nitrogen, due to losses from leaching, volatilization, and denitrification in flooded rice fields and nutrient depletion in continuous wheat cultivation (Chanda et al., 2019 ). Strategies like site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), slow-release fertilizers, and integrated nutrient management (INM) are recommended to improve FUE (Kuldip et al., 2021 ). In maize-legume rotations, while legumes enhance FUE by fixing nitrogen, challenges like imbalanced nutrient application, inadequate soil testing, and poor irrigation management still hinder efficiency (Bishnoi et al., 2020 ). To address these challenges, precision agriculture techniques such as variable rate technology (VRT), GPS-guided machinery, and enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) optimize nutrient application based on real-time data, improving FUE (Hossain et al., 2022 ). Combining chemical fertilizers with organic amendments like compost, biochar, and vermicompost further enhances soil health and FUE, supporting sustainable agriculture and environmental protection (Pandian et al., 2024 ).  4.4 Commercial fertilizer pricing in india Since November 2012, the basic retail price of urea in India has remained stable at INR 5360 per tonne. However, starting May 25, 2015, the Government mandated that all indigenous and imported urea be 100 % neem-coated, which allowed manufacturers and importers to charge an additional 5 % on the Maximum Retail Prices (MRPs). Consequently, the retail price of neem-coated urea (excluding tax) rose to INR 5628 per tonne. Additionally, the government has mandated downsizing urea bags from 50 kgs to 45 kgs (The Fertilizer Association of India, 2023 ). The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation, and Farmers Welfare, India announced that each bag of 45 kg of urea would cost INR 268. Meanwhile, prices for P and K fertilizers under the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) plan remained market-driven and regularly publicized by fertilizer businesses (Anon, 2021b ). Due to significant price increases in P&K fertilizers and raw materials, the Department of Fertilizers has set MRPs for DAP and NP/NPK complex fertilizers to ensure affordability for farmers in 2022–23. The Government of India increased NBS rates on P&K fertilizers from April to September 2022 to protect farmers from rising international fertilizer and raw material costs. Subsequently, rates were reduced from October 2022 to March 2023 due to decreasing international prices (The fertilizer association of India, 2023 ).   5 Role of fertilizers in sustainable agriculture and global food security Fertilizer minerals are vital for profitable crop development, enhancing soil properties, plant growth, soil fertility, food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development. Adequate availability and balance are crucial for meeting nutrient demands and bridging the gap between soil and organic sources (Randive et al., 2021 ). Global climate change poses unprecedented challenges to agriculture and the fertiliser industry (Paudel et al., 2023 ). The 2019 fertilizer market was valued at 155.8 billion USD, with a projected compound annual growth rate of 3.8 % from 2019 to 2024 (Vinokurov et al., 2023 ). The global population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100 (Roser, 2020 ), leading to a 70 % increase in food consumption and heightening reliance on fertilisers. Fertiliser demand significantly impacts agriculture, a key sector in many economies, including India, indirectly contributing to GDP (FAO, 2012 ). Excessive reliance on chemical fertilizers harms soil quality, causing compaction, acidification, erosion, contamination, and reduced organic matter (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). These issues lead to phosphorus and nitrogen losses, impacting water and air quality, highlighting the need for sustainable soil management practices (Randive et al., 2021 ). Continuous chemical fertilizer use alters soil properties, impacting microbial populations, nitrogen levels, organic carbon, moisture, pH, and nutrient availability in crops like corn and wheat (Liang et al., 2021 ). Organic fertilizers enhance microbial biomass and dehydrogenase activity compared to long-term chemical fertilizer use (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). Soil microorganisms, like bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses, are essential for soil health, aiding in fertility, organic matter decomposition, and nutrient cycling (Sarkar et al., 2022 ). Fertilizers, based on type, quantity, quality, and application methods, can alter microbial diversity, structure, and nutrient cycles (Randive et al., 2021 ). Agricultural practices like pesticide use and excessive fertilization disturb microbial habitats, affecting soil health (Tripathi et al., 2020 ). Long-term fertilizer application changes microbial communities, impacting organic carbon, pH, nutrients, and enzyme activities (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). High ammonia levels briefly disrupt soil microbes, affecting seedlings and soil organisms. Fertilizers like urea and potassium chloride can modify pH, nutrients, and microbial populations (Liang et al., 2021 ). Effective fertiliser use is crucial for boosting agricultural productivity and ensuring food security on limited arable land. However, the economic viability of mineral fertilisers has declined due to rising prices, now exceeding those of food (Vinokurov et al., 2023 ). Limited geological resources for fertiliser raw materials and market fluctuations create intense competition and threaten food security. Despite a steady rise in fertiliser mineral output since the last century, consumption varies widely by region (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). While stable or decreasing in Western Europe and North America, it has surged in East and South Asia, particularly in China and India. Asia now accounts for over 60 % of global fertiliser use and is rapidly growing, impacting trade flows and global competition (Randive et al., 2021 ). There's a pressing need to expand the fertiliser mineral industry and implement policies ensuring material security. Sustainable agricultural intensification and proper agronomic practices are crucial for maximising the long-term value of fertiliser minerals. 5.1 N fertilization Nitrogen, crucial for protein and genetic material, is essential for normal growth in organisms (Quan et al., 2021 ). It's primarily sourced from the atmosphere through the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, producing ammonia. Producing one kilogram of nitrogen fertilizer requires about 60 MJ of energy (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). Over the last sixty years, nitrogen fertilizer usage has risen dramatically, particularly in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Oceania, the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Managing these increases is vital to prevent surpassing critical regional nitrogen runoff concentrations. Globally, responses to increased nitrogen use have differed (Quan et al., 2021 ). While some areas improved agro-environmental performance, others experienced minimal agronomic benefits and higher environmental costs, including elevated fertilization leading to issues like nitrous oxide emissions and toxic algal blooms (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). Urea (46 % N) is the most concentrated solid nitrogen fertilizer available, supplied in pellet form and sometimes used for aerial topdressing. Urea degrades in soil to ammonium carbonate, briefly raising local pH levels (Ashitha et al., 2021 ). Various slow-acting nitrogen fertilizers have been developed, including resin- or polymer-coated ammonium nitrate granules (26% N), sulfur-coated urea prills (36% N), urea condensates, and urea formaldehydes (30 %−40 % N). These fertilizers are more prevalent in amenity and production horticulture than in field crops, but they could play a bigger role in improving nitrogen use efficiency by reducing losses and emissions (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). Managing human-derived nitrogen inputs is critical, demanding better fertilization and reduced losses. Despite this, feeding the projected additional 1.5–2 billion people by the century's end requires increased nitrogen inputs (Liang et al., 2021 ; Lomborg, 2020 ). Nations with 35 % lower pollution experienced only a 1 % potential yield loss (Gu et al., 2023 ). Economic development, population size, and agricultural intensity influence pollution relative to crop yields (Ashitha et al., 2021 ), suggesting governments can reduce nitrogen pollution without harming productivity. Nitrogen compounds such as ammonium and nitrate ions, along with urea, affect soil pH through transformations and plant uptake, influencing soil acidity (Quan et al., 2021 ). Ammonium-based fertilizers, like ammonium sulfate, worsen soil acidification by reacting with sulfuric acid, releasing hydrogen ions that displace alkaline elements on exchange sites (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). This process oxidizes soil organic matter, releasing two H + ions per ammonia nitrified to nitrate, contributing to soil acidification (Liang et al., 2021 ). Acidification varies with nitrate uptake by plants or leaching. Excessive N use can boost nitrate leaching, transporting cations like Ca and Mg to water bodies (Ashitha et al., 2021 ). Leached nitrate in sub-soils can trigger pyrite oxidation, releasing elements such as S, As, Ni, Cu, Co, Pb, Mn, and Zn (Gu et al., 2023 ). Urea and anhydrous ammonia have lower acidification potential than ammonium-based products, as they use only one H +  ion in the transformation to ammonium. Nitrate fertilizers can elevate soil pH as one H +  ion is absorbed by plants during nitrate uptake (Quan et al., 2021 ). High nitrogen levels, particularly from chemical fertilizers, alter nitrogen-fixing bacteria and fungi, influencing microbial communities and soil processes like nutrient cycling (Liang et al., 2021 ). Addressing this complexity demands swift global action. Sustainable agriculture practices encompass using AMF, cyanobacteria, and nematodes for soil health (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). Researchers have developed Escherichia coli  strains that can metabolize proteins to produce C4-C5 alcohols. These engineered microbes facilitate protein conversion into fuel and ammonia, promoting nitrogen recycling and reducing fertilizer dependence (Gu et al., 2023 ). Recovering nitrogen from waste biomass could help mitigate climate change. Significant amounts of nitrogen-containing fertilizers are wasted, evaporating or washing into water bodies, causing eutrophication. The remaining small amount may not suffice for plant growth, necessitating re-fertilization (Quan et al., 2021 ). Composting leads to substantial nitrogen loss through gaseous emissions and leachate formation. Incineration releases all nitrogen into the gas phase, mainly as N2  and NO, with minimal residual nitrogen in the ash (Liang et al., 2021 ). Energy production from waste biomass can increase emissions of nitrogen compounds, particularly N2 O, contributing to atmospheric concentration growth. Human-caused nitrogen compound emissions make up about 40 % of overall emissions, totalling nearly 2 Gt CO2 -eq/year (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). Organic farming methods like manure application and natural pest control reduce fertilizer dependence (Tadesse and Ahmed, 2023 ). Intercropping (Stefan et al., 2021 ), crop rotation (Wang et al., 2023 ), and waste management (Hidalgo et al., 2021 ) enrich soil microbes for enhanced sustainability. Precision farming optimizes resources using technology tailored to crops and local climates (Quan et al., 2021 ). Tools like spectral indices (Ashitha et al., 2021 ) and soil sensors (Yin et al., 2021 ) offer accurate diagnostics for targeted fertilization. Innovations include slow-release nitrogen fertilizers (Mustaffa et al., 2023 ) and strategic crop combinations, highlighting a move toward efficiency and reduced environmental impact in agriculture.  5.2 P fertilization In recent times, phosphorus (P) fertilization has lagged behind nitrogen (N) fertilization but is expected to increase, possibly peaking around 2030 (Sadia et al., 2023 ). Estimates vary widely on P reserve depletion, affecting production costs and accessibility. Climate-induced erosion leads to soil P loss, potentially doubling global demand for P fertilizers by 2050, crucial for sustaining crop production (Liang et al., 2021 ). Uneven global phosphorus distribution, concentrated in nations like Morocco, leads to surpluses in some regions but deficits in others, exacerbating soil fertility challenges (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). Over-fertilization saturates soils in certain areas, while 30 % of farmland globally faces phosphorus deficiency, posing threats to agricultural output and food security (Lomborg, 2020 ). Phosphate rock was classified as critical in 2014, prompting increased efforts to recover P from wastewater and other sources (Illakwahhi et al., 2024 ). Mineral fertilizers disrupt N and P cycles, impacting eutrophication. Recovered P could compete with fossil fertilizers, but regulatory challenges treating P as a resource or contaminant hinder its recovery (Jupp et al., 2021 ). Bio-fertilizers like Bacillus megaterium  or Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans  can enhance phosphorus availability in soil. However, phosphorus use efficiency is low, with only 10 % reaching plants due to losses during application (Veneklaas et al., 2012 ). Currently, the phosphorus value chain is only partially circular, with 80 % of the element from non-renewable sources not recycled. Much is lost in discarded food, leaching into waterways, and accumulating in soils, sediments, and unharvested biomass (Hollas et al., 2021 ). Reusing animal, food, and human wastes can improve phosphorus use efficiency. However, phosphorus's geopolitical challenges stem from its uneven distribution, with reserves projected to last 50–400 years (Illakwahhi et al., 2024 ). Morocco holds 77 % of global phosphorus resources, while China and the United States produce two-thirds of the world's phosphorus (Jupp et al., 2021 ). Rising demand, lower quality, and higher production costs are expected to drive phosphorus fertilizer prices up. Europe, lacking local supplies, imports mineral phosphates, potentially impacting food safety (Niu et al., 2024 ). Adopting P management practices in agriculture can improve recovery, bioavailability, and nutrient efficiency. Phosphorus is adsorbed onto various soil surfaces, limiting its availability to plants (Hollas et al., 2021 ). Fertilizer production should enable precise nutrient application. Phosphorus fertilizers can be derived from various bio-wastes, including municipal, agricultural, and food waste. Regulated struvite precipitation aids phosphorus recovery (Jupp et al., 2021 ). Nutrient recovery from waste generates side streams for fertilizer production. Animal manure can be used for energy and fermentation digestate as fertilizer alternatives (Chojnacka and Moustakas, 2024 ). However, the removal of phosphorus from detergents has slowed activated sludge formation and impacted phosphorus content in sewage sludge, crucial for biological phosphorus removal (Yao et al., 2024 ). Efficient phosphorus management involves reclaiming lost P from over-fertilized crops and reducing waste to help food-insecure regions (Sethi et al., 2020 ). Reallocating surplus P fertilizers to deficient farmlands could eliminate global P deficits, but recovery and demand reduction methods face institutional challenges (Niu et al., 2024 ). Stakeholders like farmers optimizing P use, technological communities, and states enacting food chain P recycling policies are key for phosphorus sustainability (Martin-Ortega et al., 2022 ). Global livestock production tripling amplifies scarcity and environmental dispersion, reducing P use efficiency (Illakwahhi et al., 2024 ). Shifting diets towards plant-based foods could boost P-use efficiency, rebalancing NP ratios (Sethi et al., 2020 ). These shifts promise to alleviate scarcity, highlighting the need for holistic dietary changes. Innovations like modified fertilizers and enhanced crop genotypes improve P use efficiency, aiding in better fertilization management for food security and environmental concerns (Niu et al., 2024 ).  5.3 K fertilization Since the Industrial Revolution, the extensive use of potassium in industrial fertilizers has paralleled the phosphorus situation (Silva et al., 2024 ). Affluent nations tend to overuse K fertilizers, leading to environmental and potential health issues. Conversely, poorer nations have limited access to K fertilizers, hindering agricultural productivity (Wilde et al., 2022 ). This disparity underscores a growing scarcity of mineable K sources, exacerbated by climate-induced aridity and increasing agricultural demands (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ). Potassium is vital for plant development and physiology. Potassium fertilizers are essential for soil fertility, crop yields, and global food security (Silva et al., 2024 ). Potassium is crucial for plant health, regulating enzymes, photosynthesis, and water uptake. Bhatt et al. (2021)  showed that potassium deficiency increases susceptibility to diseases and pests, lowering crop yield and quality. Potassium fertilizers strengthen cell walls, enhancing plant stress tolerance, and reducing reliance on chemical pesticides for more sustainable agriculture (Wilde et al., 2022 ).  5.4 Balanced potassium fertilizer application reduces agriculture's environmental impact It enhances nutrient efficiency, decreasing runoff and leaching, which can lead to water pollution (Yahaya et al., 2023 ). Potassium's crucial role in plant water uptake emphasizes its future availability, especially in arid-threatened regions (Liang et al., 2021 ). Developing areas struggle with K deficiencies, intensified by aridity, depleting soil K levels, hindering N and P fertilizer efficiency, reducing yields, and impacting farmers' income (Silva et al., 2024 ). India's low potash fertilizer rates amplify this issue, underscoring the urgency of sustainable K management for global agricultural resilience (Wilde et al., 2022 ).  5.5 Fertilization imbalances The global dynamics of N, P, and K fertilizers create utilization imbalances. Limited access to P fertilizers in developing regions may exacerbate nutrient deficiencies, altering global nutrient cycles beyond natural fluxes (Sadia et al., 2023 ). Such disruptions affect not only agricultural ratios but also terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, underscoring the extensive impact on ecosystem structure and function (Yahaya et al., 2023 ). Enhancing N fertilizer management is crucial to address disparities and ensure even distribution. Current anthropogenic N usage exceeds safe limits, risking severe eutrophication (Cantonati et al., 2020 ). Meeting the anticipated fertilizer demand by 2030 could quadruple environmental strains (Móring et al., 2021 ). Maintaining NPK ratios could increase demand for P and K fertilizers, potentially straining markets and affecting global food security, especially in low-income regions (Quan et al., 2021 ). Without advances and mitigation, the food system's 2050 environmental impact might exceed safe boundaries, posing substantial sustainability challenges (Yahaya et al., 2023 ). Globally, disparities in N, P, and K fertilizers, notably in countries like India and the US, hinder food production (Sadia et al., 2023 ). Balancing nutrients is vital for global food security and sustainable fertilizer use. While recent research highlights the NP ratio's importance, NK and PK ratios are relatively overlooked (Liang et al., 2021 ). Studies highlight the critical impact of balanced NK and PK ratios on crop yield (Móring et al., 2021 ). These ratios affect the balance between growth and energy production, showing different efficiencies in energy generation among N, P, and K for optimal plant development (Cantonati et al., 2020 ). Increased CO2  levels heighten plant demand for macronutrients, especially N, altering optimal NK and NP ratios. Yet, the imbalanced use of N and P with K in non-crop ecosystems remains inadequately explored (Pahalvi et al., 2021 ).  5.6 Variation in grain nutritional content in landmark cultivars with time of release The analysis of grain nutrient content reveals trends in elemental composition changes in crop cultivars (Debnath et al., 2023 ). Since the 1960s, there has been a significant decrease in essential (P, Ca, Fe, Zn, and Cu) and beneficial (Ni and Si) elements, but an increase in toxic ones (As, Cr, Ba, Sr, and Al) in rice cultivars. Likewise, in wheat, most elements (except Ba and Sr) have decreased. Similar trends have been reported in grain cultivars over the last 50 years or more (Ali et al., 2020 ). Analysis of high-yielding varieties post-Green Revolution shows declining mineral diet quality, affecting human health (Bhardwaj et al., 2024 ). This trend is likely to persist, emphasizing the need for sustainable agricultural practices. For instance, zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) in rice decreased by ∼33 % and 27 %, and wheat by ∼30 % and 19 % over 50 years. Additionally, calcium (Ca) content in rice has dropped by approximately 14 % and in wheat by 12 %, while magnesium (Mg) levels have decreased by around 20 % in both crops (Hao et al., 2021 ). Between 1960 and 2010, the Mineral-Diet Quality Index (M-DQI) for rice and wheat dropped by about 57 % and 36 %, respectively (Debnath et al., 2023 ). By 2040, this decline could increase noncommunicable diseases like iron-deficient anaemia, respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal disorders in India, highlighting the importance of nutrient profiling staple cultivars before release (Bhardwaj et al., 2024 ). Debnath et al. (2023)  observed a decline in the average daily intake of critical elements (excluding S and Mn) from rice and wheat consumption over time. In the 1960s, rice and wheat could meet 14 %, 11.2 %, and 33.7 % of the recommended dietary allowance for Ca, Fe, and Zn, respectively. This declined significantly to 5.4 %, 5.6 %, and 15.7 % in rice, and 9.1 %, 13.7 %, and 25.5 % in wheat from the 2000s and 2010s. Many attributed the decrease in nutrient content to a 'dilution effect' caused by increased yield (Hao et al., 2021 ). However, they found no significant increase in yield or harvest index in rice, only in introduced wheat cultivars. Our soil had sufficient nutrients, so the cultivars' ability to sequester nutrients was limited by their traits (Debnath et al., 2023 ). The decline in grain nutrient content is primarily attributed to plant-related factors rather than soil conditions. Contemporary plant breeding has prioritized agronomic production and disease resistance over grain mineral quality (Bhardwaj et al., 2024 ). This challenge has been partially addressed by biofortifying staples with critical nutrients like Zn and Fe on a global scale (Kiran et al., 2022 ). Future studies should examine consumer acceptance of biofortified crops after widespread adoption. Continued declines in Ca, Zn, and Fe concentrations in rice and wheat cultivars may reach 57 %, 23 %, and 40 % by 2040. Meanwhile, As, Cr, Sr, and Ba levels in rice could rise by 135 %, 47 %, 160 %, and 63 %, respectively. Similarly, wheat may see increases in Ba, Sr, and Al by 67 %, 46 %, and 15 % (Debnath et al., 2023 ). These trends could compromise grain nutritional quality, potentially rendering them unfit for human consumption in the future.   6 Policies and regulations on fertilizer use When discussing environmental policies related to fertilizer use, it's crucial to highlight countries' approaches to internalize, avoid, and repair economic activity externalities (Martínez-Dalmau et al., 2021 ). These policies aim to improve farmers' fertilizer management practices and enhance sustainable agriculture while mitigating environmental impacts. Schulte-Uebbing and de Vries (2021)  propose the comprehensive food chain NUE framework to reduce nitrogen pollution. They argue for policies targeting all food chain players, not just farmers, to cut farm-level nitrogen losses. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) since its 2000 reform aims to optimize farmer fertilizer practices, emphasizing environmental sustainability (Alexoaei et al., 2022 ). 6.1 Overview of existing policies on fertilizer application in agriculture Agricultural production heavily relies on energy, consuming it directly (water, electricity) and indirectly (pesticides, fertilizers). For instance, natural gas is vital for nitrogen fertilizer production (Liu et al., 2022 ). Recent surges in input prices raise concerns about increased food production costs, directly influencing food prices (Pu and Zhong, 2020 ). The conflict in Ukraine further compounds global economic uncertainties, disrupting supply chains, trade, and escalating energy, agricultural, and fertilizer prices (Oecd, 2022 ). Both Russia and Ukraine are vital in global agriculture, serving as key exporters and impacting food markets. Russia notably dominates as the largest exporter of fertilizers, particularly nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and phosphorus (P) fertilizers (Randive et al., 2021 ). The conflict's fallout has elevated fertilizer and energy prices, significantly inflating input costs (Mustafa, 2022 ). Effective farm-level technology adoption heavily relies on robust policies and programs. Nitrogen fertilizers' critical role in global food security urges many nations to advocate fertilizer use through policy interventions (Gweyi-Onyango and Ntinyari, 2022 ). While fertilizers are crucial for food production, their excess can harm ecosystems. Policies aimed at altering fertilizer use and boosting efficiency varies by country (Praveen and Singh, 2023 ). African nations have diverse approaches, ranging from state-run procurement to private sector-driven initiatives, to encourage fertilizer use (Abate et al., 2020 ). National-level policies are crucial to ensure sustainable agricultural practices. They should regulate fertilizer use, streamline procurement, and curb excessive application to reduce environmental risks (Randive et al., 2021 ). Such measures maintain ecosystem balance, enhance agricultural resilience, and promote responsible fertilizer management. Two policy categories influence fertilizer use: state-led marketing policies with widespread subsidies prevalent from the 1960s to the 1980s, and market-led approaches introduced during structural adjustment programs in the 1980s and 1990s (Abate et al., 2020 ). Table 1   below outlines diverse global fertilizer policies and their objectives.  6.2 Nano fertilizer's role in agriculture Human activities have disrupted global nutrient cycles, causing environmental problems such as climate change, water eutrophication, and biodiversity loss (Muruganandam et al., 2023 ). Scientists urge reducing nitrogen inputs in agriculture to address these issues while maintaining food security, advocating for more efficient fertilizers (Mrabet, 2023 ). Nano fertilizers, a potential agricultural breakthrough, enhance nutrient absorption and controlled release with lower environmental impact (Yadav et al., 2023 ). Their use raises questions on safety and effectiveness, aiming to improve nutrient absorption and reduce leaching. Nano fertilizers can target specific plant tissues and deliver multiple nutrients, improving effectiveness. They can also enhance soil structure and microbial activity, promoting soil health (Kumar et al., 2023 ). However, they raise several issues. Nanoparticles accumulating in soil and water pose long-term environmental damage. Health risks to humans and animals include nanoparticles entering plant tissues and accumulating in edible parts (Mrabet, 2023 ). Nano fertilizers may also impact soil microbial populations and ecosystem function, requiring careful consideration for safe agricultural use (Yadav et al., 2023 ). China's regulation on nanomaterial safety manages nano fertilizer production and use, requiring safety data and risk assessments before market release (Tang et al., 2023 ). In India, the MoEFCC regulates nanomaterials under the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986, mandating approval before use (Srivastava and Chowdhury, 2018 ). Regulating nano fertilizers is challenging due to ensuring their safety for human health and the environment, as nanomaterials can accumulate in soil and water, posing risks to ecosystems (Muruganandam et al., 2023 ). Assessing nano fertilizer efficacy and performance compared to regular fertilizers is problematic, requiring further research for conclusive evidence. Harmonizing laws globally is crucial for promoting international trade of nanofertilizers (Yadav et al., 2023 ). Differences in regulatory procedures and standards pose a significant obstacle to nano fertilizer use. Further research is needed to understand and mitigate risks, including monitoring environmental impact and toxicity. Standardizing testing and certification processes can ensure safety and efficacy, enhancing market access and consumer trust (Muruganandam et al., 2023 ). Policymakers can leverage nano fertilizers to enhance agriculture and ensure food security by addressing challenges and leveraging opportunities.  6.3 Nature-based policy for fertilizer application Nature-based policies integrate natural processes and biodiversity protection into agriculture to enhance sustainability. They emphasize preserving ecosystem services like soil fertility, water regulation, nutrient retention and biodiversity. These policies promote organic farming and integrated pest control to ensure nutrient cycling, reduce soil erosion, and improve water infiltration (Miralles-Wilhelm, 2021 ). For instance, the European Union's CAP incentivizes sustainable practices such as crop rotation and agroforestry, reducing synthetic inputs, improving soil health, and protecting biodiversity (Cuadros‐Casanova et al., 2023 ). India's nature-based policies integrate natural processes and biodiversity conservation into farming for sustainable agriculture. For instance, the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) promotes organic farming methods to reduce synthetic inputs, improve soil health, and preserve biodiversity (Reddy, 2018 ). While nature conservation inclusive approaches prioritize maintaining natural areas and biodiversity alongside sustainable agriculture. They aim to reduce agriculture's negative environmental impacts and promote natural resource conservation (Miralles-Wilhelm, 2021 ). For instance, Australia's National Landcare Programme supports farmers in implementing sustainable land management practices to prevent soil erosion, improve water quality, and conserve biodiversity, thus mitigating agriculture's environmental impact (Keith, 2023 ). India's nature conservation regulations prioritize protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity alongside sustainable farming. For example, the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) promotes methods like organic farming and agroforestry to increase productivity, enhance climate resilience, and improve farmers' livelihoods (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2020 ). Both policies improve soil health, reduce water pollution, and conserve biodiversity. Nature-based approaches enhance productivity and climate resilience, while protection measures preserve natural areas and species (Martínez-Dalmau et al., 2021 ). Challenges like funding, implementation, and stakeholder participation hinder both. Farmers may resist operational changes in nature-based programs, and enforcement is crucial for nature-friendly policy compliance (Miralles-Wilhelm, 2021).  6.4 Policies' effectiveness in promoting sustainable fertilizer use and soil health Agricultural subsidies serve as effective tools in global sustainable agricultural development (Zhang et al., 2021 ). Linking subsidies to environmental standards or fertilizer-saving crops encourages eco-friendly farming practices, curbing excessive chemical fertilizer usage (He et al., 2022 ). Recent subsidies support farming equipment like deep-ploughing tech and efficient irrigation, improving chemical fertilizer application efficiency and reducing its overall usage (Guo et al., 2022 ). Hand broadcasting, though cost-effective, results in higher fertilizer loss compared to machinery (Ren et al., 2021 ). China's recent subsidy aims to encourage machinery adoption, easing financial constraints for farmers (He et al., 2022 ). Mechanical application addresses uneven fertilization, enhancing chemical fertilizer efficiency and reducing its reliance (Khalofah et al., 2021 ). Precision techniques like stratified fertilization ensure better nutrient availability for crops (Zhang et al., 2021 ), offering a more efficient fertilizer application method. As per Kumar et al. (2019) , adopting fertilizer recommendations from soil health tests enhanced crop yields via well-balanced nutrition. The soil health card, outlined by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, India (Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, 2021 ), encompasses key parameters like macronutrients, micronutrients, pH, electrical conductivity, and organic carbon. It offers personalized fertilizer advice and crop-specific guidance on planting times, varieties, and intercropping systems. The initial year of the Sustainable Harvesting Campaign (SHC) showed uneven fertilizer use, with excess nitrogen and insufficient phosphorus and potash. Despite the guidance, farmers continued overusing urea due to its subsidy and cost-effectiveness (Kishore et al., 2021 ). The assessment posts the SHC revealed reduced nitrogen use, increased farmyard manure (FYM) and micronutrient application, and lowered costs by about 10 % in cotton, paddy, soybean, and 4 % in wheat (Ren et al., 2021 ). While yields generally rose, the primary benefit lay in decreased fertilizer reliance. Net returns surged approximately 22 % in soybean, 11 % in paddy, and 16 % in cotton and wheat. SHC led to heightened gypsum and micronutrient use. Post-SHC, FYM adoption rose, with 40 % using their own and 60 % purchasing, influenced by SHC results highlighting low organic matter (Reddy, 2019 ).  6.5 Suggestions for potential improvements or formulating new policies to address fertilizer-related soil health issues Soil degradation is exacerbated by inadequate fertilizer policies (Abay et al., 2022 ). Stronger policies should optimize fertilizer use and prioritize soil health management for sustainable farming.1. Conducting routine evaluations of soil health is essential for halting deterioration. Despite early expenses, state capacity development—using GPS-enabled tablets for sample collection and automated test labs—is crucial. It is advised to reduce doorstep delivery subsidies for micronutrients like sulphur and to reduce subsidies for nitrogen fertilizer to promote balanced use. (Reddy, 2019 ).  2. It is essential to establish Soil Health Centers (SHCs) for doorstep delivery and quick quantitative soil testing. Nutrient level detection might be revolutionized by the development of precision agricultural instruments like soil sensors. (Yin et al., 2021 ).  3. Increasing farmer knowledge of Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) is essential to better farming methods. Across the country, enhanced agricultural production and sustained soil health are supported by the integration of initiatives to address NUE. (Salim and Raza, 2020 ).  4. Incentivizing environmental services boosts effective crop residue recycling, on-farm green manure generation, and cover crop promotion. Encouraging Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) with local organic resources is crucial. Stimulating the recycling of waste from urban and peri‑urban vegetable, fruit, and flower crops is essential (Liu and Ge, 2023 ).  5. Aligning community biogas programs with Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) enhances Fuel Use Efficiency (FUE). Priority should be given to timely fertilizer availability in nutrient-efficient zones. Incentivizing farmers to invest in INM and Integrated Weed Management (IWM) fosters soil and water conservation (Almansa et al., 2023 ).  6. Stimulating biofertilizer production balances chemical fertilizer use. Advanced research exploring nano-biofertilizers can elevate nutrient efficiency in agriculture (Rai et al., 2023 ).  7. Promote organic production through price premiums, compensation, and insurance for organic products. Encourage practices like farmyard manure enhancement, composting, and green manuring through training and support to foster Integrated Nutrient Management (Hsieh et al., 2023 ).  8. Prioritize robust crop residue management policies at field levels to curb residue burning, boost soil organic carbon, and prevent nutrient loss, resulting in enhanced soil health (Kumar et al., 2023 ).  9. Affordable micro-irrigation and fertigation drive improved fertilizer and water efficiencies amid climate variations for farmers' adoption.  10. Deploy technical specialists to educate farmers on prudent chemical fertilizer use.      7 The nexus of soil health, food security, and human health Soil health, food security, and human health are intricately connected, forming a vital nexus essential for sustainable ecosystems and societies. Recognizing this, the United Nations' SDGs, particularly SDG 2, SDG 3, and SDG 15, emphasize the importance of these interconnections for global sustainability (Lal et al., 2021 ). Healthy soils are the foundation of productive agriculture, which is crucial for food security, while the nutritional quality of food directly influences human health (Mrabet, 2023 ). This passage delves into the synergy between these areas, emphasizing the need for integrated conservation efforts to secure a sustainable future. Soil health extends beyond mere fertility, encompassing the soil's role as a living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans. Healthy soil maintains its structure, effectively stores water, supports biodiversity, and resists degradation processes like erosion and compaction, thereby ensuring productivity and resilience, which are crucial for food security (Sahu and Gupta, 2024 ). However, soil degradation poses a global challenge, driven by factors such as deforestation, overgrazing, industrial agriculture, and urbanization. These activities lead to the loss of organic matter, reduced biodiversity, and physical degradation of soils (Lal et al., 2021 ). Additionally, contamination from industrial waste, pesticides, and heavy metals worsens the issue, diminishing soil fertility and increasing the risk of erosion. Climate change further threatens soil health, with altered temperature and precipitation patterns leading to erosion, nutrient leaching, and extreme weather events that disrupt soil structure (Mrabet, 2023 ). To combat soil degradation, sustainable soil management practices are essential, which include conservation tillage, crop rotation, cover cropping, and using organic amendments like compost and biochar (Hussain et al., 2021 ). Conservation tillage minimizes soil disturbance, preserving structure and enhancing moisture retention. Crop rotation and cover cropping boost soil biodiversity and organic matter, improving nutrient cycling and reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers (Lal et al., 2021 ). Organic amendments enrich soil fertility and resilience, improving structure and resistance to erosion and compaction. For instance, Miura et al. (2013)  showed that conventional tillage with organic amendments had higher soil carbon levels (1.31 ± 0.09 %) than no-till with amendments (1.28 ± 0.2 %). However, without amendments, no-till had higher soil carbon content (1.18 ± 0.13 %) than conventional tillage (1.08 ± 0.24 %). The type and duration of organic amendments are crucial in evaluating tillage regime impacts on soil carbon. Biochar, a carbon-rich material from plant residues, enhances soil carbon storage, mitigating climate change while improving soil health. For instance, Kannan et al. (2021)  observed in a 3-year study on sandy soils that applying 5 t ha-1  of red gram stalk biochar and 750 kg ha-1  of enriched farmyard manure (FYM) decreased bulk density from 1.41 to 1.38 Mg m-3  and increased soil water content from 10 % to 22 % and increased soil total carbon content to 9.4 g kg-1 . The successful iimplementation of these practices requires supportive policies and educational programs to encourage widespread adoption. Governments can incentivize farmers through subsidies or tax breaks, while research and extension services play a vital role in spreading knowledge about these practices and their adaptation to local environmental conditions (Lal et al., 2021 ). 7.1 The interdependence of soil health and food security Healthy soils are crucial for producing abundant, nutritious food. Soils rich in organic matter and balanced nutrients support vigorous plant growth and result in higher crop yields (Mrabet, 2023 ). In contrast, degraded soils are less fertile, leading to reduced productivity and increasing vulnerability to pests and diseases. Nutrient-rich soils not only enhance crop yield but also improve nutritional quality of the produce (Lal et al., 2021 ). Improving soil health through sustainable practices enhances both food production and nutritional quality, addressing malnutrition and promoting health. Sustainable agriculture, including agroecology and precision farming, is crucial for long-term food security. Agroecology integrates ecological principles, fostering biodiversity, and reducing chemical inputs, while precision agriculture uses technology to optimize resource use and crop management (Sahu and Gupta, 2024 ). These approaches build resilient agricultural systems that can better withstand environmental stresses and ensure stable, nutritious food supplies. Techniques like soil testing, remote sensing, and GPS-guided equipment enable precise application of water, fertilizers, and pesticides, reducing waste and environmental impacts (Usama, 2024 ). These technologies also aid in monitoring soil health and guiding practices such as crop rotation and cover cropping. Organic farming, which avoids synthetic inputs, promotes biodiversity and increases organic matter, improving soil structure and nutrient availability. For instance, Arunrat et al. (2022)  found higher soil carbon stores in organic farming plots (75,226 kg C ha-1 ) compared to conventional farming plots (67,254 kg C ha-1 ) over a three-year trial. Practices like composting and green manures enhance soil health and reduce degradation, supporting both food security and ecosystem health through sustainable methods. Oechaiyaphum et al. (2020)  found green manure increased SOC content from 3.43 to 4.26 g kg-1 , while another study reported lower SOC with green manure (7.5 g kg-1 ) compared to synthetic fertilizer (9.4 g kg-1 ) (Thuithaisong et al., 2011 ). Despite the clear benefits of sustainable soil management and agricultural practices, challenges to their widespread adoption persist. Economic barriers, such as the initial costs and potential short-term income loss, can deter farmers (Lal et al., 2021 ). Social and cultural factors, including traditional practices and resistance to change, also pose obstacles. However, these challenges present opportunities for innovation and collaboration. Public-private partnerships, government incentives, and educational programs can help address economic and social barriers (Sahu and Gupta, 2024 ). Additionally, advancing technologies, such as drought-resistant crops and enhanced soil amendments, can further support sustainable agriculture and food security (Mrabet, 2023 ). By overcoming these challenges and leveraging opportunities, we can develop agricultural systems that ensure food security while safeguarding soil health and the environment for future generations.  7.2 The connection between food security and human health Food security, defined as having reliable access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food, is crucial for human health. Consistent access to a diverse range of foods supports a balanced diet, providing essential nutrients for growth, development, and disease prevention (Lal et al., 2021 ). Conversely, food insecurity can cause malnutrition, including malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and obesity. Undernutrition, marked by insufficient calorie and nutrient intake, weakens the immune system and heightens the risk of infections and chronic diseases (Morales et al., 2023 ). Micronutrient deficiencies, or "hidden hunger," impair cognitive development, reduce productivity, and increase risks of birth defects and other health issues (Kurmi et al., 2023 ). Obesity, increasingly seen in food-insecure populations, often results from diets high in energy-dense but nutrient-poor foods (Morales et al., 2023 ). This paradox occurs when sufficient calories are available, but essential nutrients are lacking. Obesity raises the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers (Kurmi et al., 2023 ). Agriculture is crucial to public health, influencing food availability, affordability and quality. Sustainable practices that enhance soil health and biodiversity improve food security and produce nutrient-rich foods, promoting better health outcomes (Lal et al., 2021 ). The shift to industrial agriculture, marked by monocropping and synthetic inputs, has increased the availability of cheap, calorie-dense foods, often sacrificing nutritional quality (Sahu and Gupta, 2024 ). Traditional diets rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains are being replaced by processed foods high in sugars and fats, leading to rising rates of diet-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes (Morales et al., 2023 ). In response, agroecology and sustainable agriculture emphasize producing diverse and nutrient-rich foods to address these challenges. Focusing on soil health and biodiversity enhances food quality and supports resilient agricultural systems (Mrabet, 2023 ). To enhance public health through better nutrition, implementing supportive policies and interventions is crucial. Key strategies include integrating nutritional goals into agricultural policies to align food production with public health objectives (Lal et al., 2021 ). Promoting nutrient-rich crops like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and biofortified varieties can improve dietary quality. Fortifying staple foods with essential micronutrients and providing targeted supplementation address deficiencies in vulnerable populations (Kurmi et al., 2023 ). Public health campaigns and educational initiatives, such as school-based nutrition programs, community gardening and cooking classes, help individuals make healthier food choices. Government policies that support sustainable food production, regulate food marketing and improve access to healthy foods are essential. This includes restricting unhealthy food marketing to children and incentivizing diverse, nutrient-rich crop production (Sahu and Gupta, 2024 ). A holistic approach linking agriculture, nutrition, and public health can foster food systems that enhance health and well-being for all. Ecosystem services are crucial for sustainable development, providing essential goods like food, water, and raw materials and functions such as climate regulation, water purification, and nutrient cycling (Lal et al., 2021 ). Preserving these services supports food security, healthy soil, and human well-being, advancing multiple SDGs. Healthy ecosystems enhance dietary variety, provide medicinal plants, and ensure long-term agricultural productivity by supporting soil fertility and nutrient cycling (Morales et al., 2023 ). Implementing conservation practices like agroecology, organic farming, integrated pest management and reforestation maximizes these services (Sahu and Gupta, 2024 ). Recognizing and protecting ecosystem services is vital for achieving the SDGs and ensuring a sustainable future.  7.3 The interplay between soil health, food security, and human health: the synergistic relationship The synergy between soil health, food security, and human health is crucial for sustainable development. Healthy soils underpin sustainable agriculture, which is vital for producing nutritious food and ensuring food security (Lal et al., 2021 ). Food security, in turn, affects human health by influencing diet quality and the prevalence of diet-related diseases (Owino et al., 2022 ). To achieve SDGs, we must adopt conservation approaches that enhance soil health, ensure food security, and support human health (Mrabet, 2023 ). To foster the synergy between soil health, food security, and human health, implementing supportive policies is essential. Key recommendations include:a. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices:  Governments should incentivize farmers to adopt practices like organic farming, agroecology, and conservation agriculture through subsidies, technical assistance, and market access for sustainably produced foods.  b. Integrating soil health into national food security strategies:  Soil health must be central to food security plans. This includes investing in soil restoration, conducting regular soil health assessments, and enacting policies to prevent degradation.  c. Supporting research and innovation:  Ongoing research is crucial for developing technologies that enhance soil health and food security. This includes studying soil microbiomes, plant-soil interactions, and creating climate-resilient crops.  d. Educating and capacity building:  Training programs in sustainable practices, soil management, and nutrition are vital to empower communities and policymakers.    This holistic approach requires integrating sustainable agricultural practices, supportive policies, and cross-sector collaboration. Prioritizing soil health will help build a resilient food system that benefits both people and the planet (Sahu and Gupta, 2024 ). Recognizing and acting on the interconnectedness of these elements is essential for providing future generations with the nutritious food needed for healthy, fulfilling lives.   8 Strategies for sustainable fertilizer use and soil health promotion 8.1 Preserving and adding up soil organic matter: adopting alternative agricultural practices Intensive agriculture erodes soil organic matter, compromising its health and productivity. This leads to increased reliance on fertilizers and water, amplifying CO2  emissions (Mishra et al., 2022 ). "Sustainable agriculture," coined in the late 1980s, focuses on enhancing soil health by bolstering organic matter and reducing erosion (Pinheiro Machado Filho et al., 2021 ). Introduced by the National Research Council and later included in the US Agriculture 1990 Farm Bill, it aims for economic viability while minimizing external inputs (Dimitri and Effland, 2020 ). Varied practices like agroecology, integrated farming, and precision agriculture fall under this framework, which isn't fixed and might include agrochemicals like synthetic fertilizers and pesticides within certain strategies. The core remains holistic, conserving resources while diversifying approaches (Kumar et al., 2023 ). Soil erosion resistance relies on soil organic matter (SOM) and plant cover. Regions like Asia and Africa grapple with severe erosion, risking soil carbon loss and landscape devastation (Salim and Raza, 2020 ). SOM's role in drought-resistant soil and sustainable food production is pivotal, fostering erosion-resistant soil aggregates. Fertile soils can contain up to 100 tonnes of organic matter per hectare (around 4 % of total soil weight), while SOM typically represents 1–5 % of agricultural topsoil (Voltr et al., 2021 ). Conventional farming practices exacerbate topsoil erosion and SOM loss, removing up to 5 times more organic matter-rich soil. This topsoil layer holds 95 % of soil nitrogen and 25–50 % of soil phosphorus, essential for soil fertility (Blanco and Lal, 2023 ). No-till or minimum-tillage methods, coupled with organic farming, combat soil loss, bolster soil organic matter, and revive fertility and biodiversity (Khangura et al., 2023 ). These practices reduce erosion, pollution, and benefit ecosystems while boosting agronomic output and food security (Abay et al., 2022 ). However, complete reliance on no-till may require supplementary measures like cover crops or proper rotations, particularly when combined with excessive agrochemical use (Blanco and Lal, 2023 ). Recent discussions question its efficacy as a carbon sink and in mitigating climate change. Nevertheless, no-till methods offer significant advantages, slashing energy usage by 70 %, and reducing herbicide and pesticide application by 50 %, thereby mitigating fossil fuel emissions and hazardous chemical dispersion (Yin et al., 2021 ). Soils with 1 % soil organic matter (SOM) can retain 10,000–11,000 litres of plant-available water per hectare to a depth of 30 cm (Voltr et al., 2021 ). Organic crops often outperform conventional ones in drought conditions, showing a 70 %−90 % advantage. This advantage arises from the superior water-holding capacity of organically managed soil, offering up to 100 % more water in the crop root zone (Khangura et al., 2023 ). Organic systems display reduced production variability and increased stability. Additionally, low-input methods like organic farming significantly enhance soil biological activity, supporting diverse microbial life critical for sustainable soil health and productivity (Almansa et al., 2023 ).  8.2 Adoption of precision agriculture techniques Conventional fertilizer methods often lack precision, leading to issues like yield reduction, increased costs, and environmental risks (Karunathilake et al., 2023 ). Soil and plant sensing technology presents a solution, offering real-time insights into soil and plant nutrient status (Munnaf et al., 2021 ). These sensors measure various soil and plant parameters - pH, electrical conductivity, nutrient content, and chlorophyll levels - improving fertilizer precision (Yin et al., 2021 ). Soil sensors gauge pH, temperature, moisture, and nutrients, while plant sensors like the Parrot Pot, Edyn Garden sensor, and Koubachi Wi-Fi sensor monitor plant height, chlorophyll content, and water status (Karunathilake et al., 2023 ). This real-time data aids in fine-tuning fertilizer application, ensuring precise nutrient delivery and optimizing plant growth and health (Munnaf et al., 2021 ). In rainfed conditions, optimizing fertilizer use efficiency involves estimating soil moisture using diverse sensors (Yin et al., 2021 ). Capacitance types like Decagon Devices EC-5, Chirp, and Sentek Technologies, alongside resistance types such as FC-28, YL-69, and V1.2, and time domain reflectometry (TDR) examples like Decagon Devices Inc. EM50-TDR, Campbell Scientific CS616, and METER Group, Inc. C-Probe sensors aid in continuous soil moisture monitoring (Dubois, 2021 ). These sensors, coupled with data loggers, enable real-time field deployment. Predictive irrigation systems, integrating sensor data with weather forecasts and evapotranspiration models, enhance irrigation decisions by 25 % (Yartu et al., 2022 ). GIS tools, like the Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS), fuse spatial data with soil and crop yield information, empowering farmers to discern patterns in crop yields, soil fertility, and plant health (Dadrasi et al., 2022 ). Fig. 7   demonstrates sustainable management techniques for improving soil health and food security. This insight helps make informed decisions on fertilization and management practices. To determine soil properties like total nitrogen, machine learning (ML) algorithms coupled with spectroscopy are utilized (Xu et al., 2024 ). Integrating ML with Internet of Things (IoT) data transforms farm management into sophisticated AI systems, offering insightful recommendations for improved productivity (Ennaji et al., 2023 ). Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) is commonly used for accurate multivariable predictions. PLSR involves deriving linear combinations of spectra, effectively explaining response variation while handling predictor differences (Dubois, 2021 ). Widely used in soil spectroscopy, it's successful in evaluating water and nitrogen status. Challenges include data availability, training, and model accuracy (Wang et al., 2021 ). UAV platforms rapidly map NDVI, aiding in Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) assessment. The AS-Scanner ensures swift and precise NDVI acquisition, enabling informed fertilizer decisions, curbing overuse, and mitigating environmental impacts (Jiang et al., 2021 ). Spectral reflectance from UAV sensors can identify nutrient deficiencies, and toxicity, aiding in holistic plant health analysis, and supporting sustainable farming practices.  8.3 Promotion of organic and alternative fertilizers Organic fertilizers offer a solution to waste management and soil degradation issues in developing nations (Ayilara et al., 2020 ). Derived from diverse sources like plant-based substances and animal manure, they vary in nutrient content and types based on materials and biodegradability (Salazar Sandoval et al., 2024 ). Organic fertilizers contain less nitrogen and phosphorus by weight compared to chemical ones (Shaji et al., 2021 ). Studies suggest substituting some chemical fertilizers with organic ones to boost soil organic carbon levels and microbial activity, critical for soil health and climate change mitigation (Ayilara et al., 2020 ). Organic manures, excluding green manure, are chiefly derived from animal waste and serve as vital sources of nutrients for soil fertility. They aid soil structure and water retention, influencing farming practices based on soil type, crop variety, season, and farmer experience (Shaji et al., 2021 ). Compost, formed through controlled decomposition of organic matter, benefits from regulated moisture and lime treatment to hasten breakdown and achieve a favourable C/N ratio (Salazar Sandoval et al., 2024 ). Green manure, youthful plant material, enriches the soil with nitrogen when incorporated, serving as a viable substitute when manure is limited (Fitrah, 2022 ). Organic farming avoids synthetic inputs, gaining recognition for sustainable food production, and addressing food security concerns with methods prioritizing environmental sustainability (Saffeullah et al., 2021 ). Fig. 8   depicts the impact of integrated nutrient management on crops and the environment.  8.4 Illustrations on management practices to enhance soil health Soil health management hinges on (1) gauging synergies and tradeoffs in techniques; (2) implementing proven, practical conservation methods; and (3) involving stakeholders for widespread adoption (Vanlauwe et al., 2023 ). The measures listed below help to safeguard soil and ecosystem health while also increasing resistance to climate change.• Organic inputs improve soil health and ecosystem functions.  • Implement climate-specific conservation tillage to reduce soil disturbance.  • Optimize soil cover with crop rotations, cover crops, agroforestry, and residue degradation.  • Diversify crop rotation and cover crops to improve soil biota and sustain long-term productivity.  • Implement Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) strategies that combine organic, biological, and mineral resources.  • Manage the rhizosphere to optimize nitrogen utilization and crop yield.  • Reduce soil salinity, alkalinity, acidification, and pollution.  • Use soil biology technology to select disease-resistant plants and change microbial populations.  • Use renewable resources instead of manufactured fertilizers to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and petrochemicals.  • Collaborate with land users to monitor soil health and evaluate the success of applied techniques.     8.5 Education and outreach programs for farmers on responsible fertilizer use Historically, the fertilizer sector prioritized procedural enhancements over product innovation, as all produced fertilizers were sold. Currently, there's limited focus on renewable resources due to a lack of commercial incentives. Environmental challenges are pushing for technical improvements (Ning et al., 2023 ). Ammonia production emits CO2 , requiring factories to pay for emission permits. While some CO2  is utilized in urea synthesis, a portion is released during application (Ishaq and Crawford, 2024 ). The circular economy promotes reusing, valorising, recycling, and leveraging natural cycles. Despite significant attention, full implementation is partial. Developing bio-based fertilizer technologies should prioritize minimizing environmental impact, regeneratively using resources, considering scarcity, and ensuring profitability for industrial enterprises (Jagadeesan et al., 2023 ). Prioritizing natural resource limitations and environmental conservation while meeting corporate needs is crucial. However, the fertilizer industry often undervalues innovative technologies (Rey-Martínez et al., 2024 ). For example, using feathers, containing 11 % nitrogen, not only provides nitrogen but also amino acids, serving as a chelating agent for micronutrient ions and a biostimulator for plant growth. This method, if well-structured, emits no emissions and consumes no energy (Jagadeesan et al., 2023 ). Similarly, in the phosphate fertilizer industry, converting bone meal into hydroxyapatite, which can be broken down like wet phosphoric acid, offers environmental benefits (Kowalski et al., 2023 ). The Chinese government implemented policies like soil testing and organic fertilizer subsidies to promote proper fertilizer practices (Ishaq and Crawford, 2024 ). Farmers often lack crucial knowledge in three domains. First, they lack awareness of fertilizer overuse effects. For instance, Rahman and Zhang (2018)  found many aren't aware of their overuse. Second, procedural knowledge, like effective fertilizer usage, is deficient. Wimalawansa and Wimalawansa (2015)  noted only 20 % know about eutrophication from over-application. Lastly, conceptual knowledge is lacking the understanding of the underlying reasons behind fertilizer use and its impact on environmental degradation (Kowalski et al., 2023 ). These gaps hinder effective fertilizer management. Farmers often believe that more fertilizer leads to higher yields and that cutting fertilizer results in yield losses (Ishaq and Crawford, 2024 ). These gaps in knowledge hinder eco-friendly technology adoption. Effective knowledge shifts perceptions on fertilizer's environmental impact, fostering change (Jagadeesan et al., 2023 ). Procedural knowledge addresses inhibiting factors, crucial for behavioural change. Declarative knowledge reduces uncertainty about fertilizer reduction, aiding in mitigating over-application (Rey-Martínez et al., 2024 ). Enhanced knowledge acquisition is a vital step toward embracing sustainable fertilizer practices in agriculture. Extension technicians play a pivotal role in farmers' knowledge acquisition regarding fertilizer management (Ning et al., 2023 ). Evaluating training effectiveness could guide governments in designing eco-friendly fertilizer management programs.   9 The three pillars of conservation agriculture: A pathway to sustainable soil health, food security, and human health Conservation agriculture is key to sustainable farming, emphasizing minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover, and crop diversification. These practices enhance soil health, improve food security, and protect human health, addressing soil degradation and climate change while supporting the broader objectives of the SDGs (Farooq, 2023 ). 9.1 Minimum soil disturbance: preserving soil structure and health The first pillar of conservation agriculture focuses on minimizing soil disturbance, primarily through no-till or reduced-till farming. Traditional ploughing disrupts soil structure, causing erosion, loss of organic matter, and a decline in beneficial organisms (Angon et al., 2023 ). By reducing tillage, soil structure is preserved, maintaining porosity and the network of pores needed for water infiltration and root growth (Farooq, 2023 ). This practice helps prevent soil compaction, allowing roots to access nutrients and water more effectively. For instance, Li et al. (2020)  conducted an intensive meta-analysis of a global dataset from 264 publications on the effects of agronomic and environmental factors on soil physical properties under no-tillage. Compared to conventional tillage, no-tillage increased soil bulk density by 2.3 %, soil penetration resistance by 27.8 % and decreased soil pH by 1.8 %. However, no-tillage improved mean weight diameter and water-stable aggregates by 50 % and 36 %, respectively, and increased soil available water capacity by 8.7 %. Additionally, minimizing soil disturbance is essential for building and maintaining soil organic matter, crucial for long-term soil health. Organic matter is crucial for nutrient cycling, water retention, and soil fertility. Topa et al. (2021)  evaluated SOC storage, pools, bulk density, aggregation, and nutrient availability under no-tillage, chisel, and conventional tillage systems in a long-term experiment. After 10 years of crop rotation, no-tillage had higher total organic carbon in the 0–30 cm soil depth than conventional tillage. In the 0–10 cm depth, no-till and chisel treatments had 7–13 %, 34–35 %, and 9–15 % higher non-labile fraction, very-labile fraction, and total organic carbon, respectively, than conventional tillage. In contrast, conventional tillage can exacerbate soil erosion, leaving it vulnerable to wind and water damage. By minimizing soil disturbance, conservation agriculture maintains soil structure and uses natural vegetation or crop residues to protect the surface, preserving topsoil and preventing sedimentation in water bodies, which protects water quality (Angon et al., 2023 ). Additionally, minimal tillage enhances carbon sequestration by keeping soil undisturbed, preventing carbon from being released into the atmosphere as CO2  (Farooq, 2023 ). Over time, this practice can increase soil carbon stocks, helping to mitigate climate change while boosting soil fertility and productivity.  9.2 Permanent soil cover: shielding soil and enhancing biodiversity The second pillar of conservation agriculture is maintaining a permanent soil cover using cover crops, crop residues, or mulch. This cover is crucial for protecting the soil from erosion, reducing water evaporation, and suppressing weed growth (Francaviglia et al., 2023 ). It helps preserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and support diverse soil organisms. Permanent soil cover acts as a shield against rainfall impact, reducing surface runoff and soil erosion. For instance, Pheap et al. (2019)  reported a 2.6-fold increase in labile carbon stocks in Cambodian soybean fields using stylo and great millet as cover crops compared to those without cover crops. It also slows water flow, allowing more water to infiltrate the soil rather than being lost as runoff (Farooq, 2023 ). With growing concerns over water scarcity in many regions, this practice is essential for sustaining soil health and enhancing water conservation. Permanent soil cover helps conserve moisture by reducing evaporation, keeping the soil cooler and more humid, which is vital during hot and dry periods. This moisture retention supports crops through droughts and stabilizes food supplies (Francaviglia et al., 2023 ). Additionally, permanent soil cover promotes biodiversity both above and below ground. For instance, Mitchell et al. (2017)  found a 12 % increase in total N at 0–15 cm depth and 10 % at 15–30 cm depth with cover crops. Similarly, Muhammad et al. (2021)  reported 40 %, 51 %, and 24 % increases in microbial biomass C, N, and total phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA), respectively. These increases are attributed to additional C and N inputs from cover crop residues (Schmidt et al., 2019 ). Cover crops enrich the soil microbial community, boosting total bacteria and fungi by 15 % and 19 %, respectively (Muhammad et al., 2021 ). Cover crops offer habitat for beneficial insects, pollinators, and natural pest predators, while beneath the surface, it supports microorganisms, earthworms, and other soil fauna crucial for nutrient cycling and soil health. This biodiversity enhances resilience to pests, diseases, and climate variability. The decomposition of organic matter from cover crops or residues enriches the soil by continuously supplying essential nutrients, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers, which can have negative environmental impacts if overused (Francaviglia et al., 2023 ).  9.3 Crop diversification: building resilience and enhancing productivity The third pillar of conservation agriculture is crop diversification, which includes rotating crops or planting a variety of crops together. This practice improves soil health, boosts biodiversity, and enhances resilience to pests, diseases, and climate changes (Ferdinand and Baret, 2024 ). Methods like intercropping, agroforestry, and incorporating legumes into rotations help prevent issues associated with monoculture, where pests and diseases can accumulate (Moreira et al., 2024 ). Crop diversification increases soil organic carbon, reducing the reliance on chemical pesticides. For example, incorporating sun hemp (Crotalaria juncea ) or forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor ) before soybeans increased soil carbon stores by 6.25 and 2.5 t ha-1 , respectively (Rigon and Calonego, 2020 ). Different crops also impact soil structure differently; deep-rooted crops like maize can break up compacted layers, improving water infiltration, while shallow-rooted crops stabilize the topsoil and prevent erosion (Ferdinand and Baret, 2024 ). This diversity contributes to overall soil health and resilience. Crop diversification enhances agricultural productivity by mitigating risks associated with crop failure. Growing a variety of crops reduces reliance on a single crop, which can be vulnerable to market fluctuations, pests, and climate extremes (Bedeke, 2023 ). This approach not only strengthens food security and improves dietary diversity but also supports essential ecosystem services. Diverse cropping systems boost pollination, enrich soil fertility through nutrient cycling, and offer wildlife habitat (Ferdinand and Baret, 2024 ). Additionally, diversified farms are more resilient to climate variability and extreme weather events, as varied crops can buffer against droughts, floods, and temperature fluctuations (Moreira et al., 2024 ).  9.4 Synergy between the three pillars The three pillars of conservation agriculture are interdependent and synergistic. Together, they create a resilient agricultural system that enhances soil health, secures food production, and promotes well-being (Farooq, 2023 ). This approach aligns with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). By reducing soil disturbance, maintaining permanent cover, and diversifying crops, conservation agriculture builds healthy soils that are more productive and resilient to stress (Francaviglia et al., 2023 ). This contributes to food security and supports the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, crucial for achieving SDG 15. Conservation agriculture enhances soil fertility, reduces erosion, and boosts biodiversity, supporting diverse crop production and improving dietary diversity and nutritional quality (Kumawat et al., 2023 ). This approach aligns with SDG 2, which aims to end hunger, achieve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture. By minimizing chemical inputs, conservation agriculture improves crop quality and ecosystem services, which supports SDG 3′s focus on ensuring healthy lives and well-being. The three pillars create a sustainable agricultural system that is resilient, productive, and environmentally sound. These practices work together to nurture soil health, ensure food security, and promote human health. Embracing these principles can advance progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those related to agriculture, health, and environmental sustainability. Conservation agriculture offers a balanced approach to meeting the needs of a growing population while protecting and restoring vital natural resources.   10 Conclusions The increased use of inorganic fertilizers in smallholder farming significantly boosts crop yields, which enhances food security and indirectly raises agricultural incomes, thus aiding in poverty alleviation. However, economic restrictions frequently limit smallholders' capacity to apply fertilizers in a manner that maximises net returns. The profitability of fertilizer use depends on the nutrient, crop and application rate. Smallholder farmers must carefully balance their limited resources to optimise fertilizer investments and increase yields. This emphasizes the critical relevance of low-cost fertilizer methods in promoting agricultural sustainability and alleviating poverty. Human-induced nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) burdens now exceed natural flows, with nitrogen loads increasing exponentially faster than P and potassium (K). Elevated NP ratios globally have a substantial influence on ecosystems and their functions, hindering healthy food production. Using smart and eco-friendly farming techniques along with advanced biotechnology can solve the global problem of using fertilizers sustainably. By applying the 4R approach (Right Source, Right Rate, Right Time, Right Place) right away, we can manage fertilizers better, boost crop yields, and support both food security and environmental health. Poverty alleviation is critical for preventing conflict and environmental degradation, although it is not always associated with agricultural productivity or resource shortages. Understanding these intricacies is critical for long-term solutions that promote societal stability, environmental preservation and efficient resource management. Soil research is essential for understanding the relationship between soil and humans and its importance for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Adoption of nature-based solutions like using farm manure, green manures and legume crops, promoting horticulture, practicing zero tillage and managing crop residues can help improve soil health, food and nutritional security. Prospects Farmers' reliance on NPK treatment without sufficient soil testing has resulted in nutrient imbalances, reducing the effectiveness of essential nutrients for plants. Deteriorating soil health causes significant yield gaps between prospective and actual harvests. Even bio-fortified crop varieties may produce nutrient-poor produce in the absence of adequate soil nutrients, endangering human and animal health. Urgent action is required to reverse this land degradation trend. National programs aimed at quadrupling farmers' incomes through infrastructure, technology, policy and institutional improvements provide hope for addressing these difficulties. Improving the knowledge delivery system necessitates novel ways such as para-extension workers, IT tools, and localized decision support systems, which are critical for reaching a large number of small farmers. Fig. 9   depicts the strategies for ensuring food security through balanced fertilization. The emphasis on soil research in conjunction with technology development and implementation guarantees that technology is relevant to farmers.
