                  Objectives
                  This paper describes a project designed to quantify the extent to which existing competency frameworks used for educating the public health workforce contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) directly relevant to public health.
               
                  Study design
                  This was a qualitative study involving a content and thematic analysis and mapping of nine available public health competency sets against the World Federation of Public Health Association's Global Charter for the Public's Health and the SDGs.
               
                  Methods
                  First, the SDG targets directly relevant to public health were selected, then mapped against the elements of the Global Charter to illustrate their alignment with aspects of public health practice. Next, competencies from each respective framework were mapped against the SDG targets, and the results quantified as to the coverage of the SDG targets by each of the frameworks.
               
                  Results
                  Overall, very few competencies directly or fully covered the SDG targets in question, however, there were more competencies partially covering the targets. Except for one framework, many issues found in the SDG targets were not explicitly addressed by the competencies in most of the frameworks, namely, migration, human rights, violence, and food and water scarcity.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Overall, urgent action is required to ensure public health competency frameworks are more in line with the SDGs and include public health issues that disproportionally affect low- and middle-income countries.

Keywords Competency frameworks  Competencies for public health  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  Mapping  Public health education and training    1 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a core part of the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [1 ]. Since their inception in 2015, these ambitious goals aim to be achieved by UN Member States by 2030, to improve human lives and protect the environment. The 17 goals and 169 targets [1 ] are essential in guiding public health and global health practice around the world. Although SDG 3 ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’  is a long-identified ‘health goal’, almost all of the remaining 16 targets are indirectly related to health. As the SDGs have the potential to drastically reduce poverty, hunger, and disease, their integration into all spheres of health practice should continue to be a priority, including education and training programmes for the public health workforce. The knowledge, skills, and individual attributes a person requires for public health practice, are defined as competencies [2 ]. Competency frameworks, which define and list applicable competencies generally grouped into domains such as ‘Disease prevention and control’, are designed to inform public health curricula [2 ,3 ]. Many frameworks include additional sections with underpinning knowledge for the specific competencies, and some differentiate between knowledge- and practice-based competencies. The assessment of these frameworks, and revision to include capabilities that address emerging global issues, presents an important starting point in streamlining public health education programmes globally. Previous research [4 ,5 ] concluded that there remains an apparent lack of competency frameworks for public health education specific to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). As is commonly acknowledged, LMICs face challenges that are not necessarily addressed in competency frameworks created for high-income countries (HIC). Additionally, LMICs experience the greatest burden of disease yet have the smallest health workforce in relation to their needs [6 ]. This indicates the importance of education programmes for the public health workforce in these regions. The Global Charter for the Public's Health (‘the Charter’) developed by the World Federation of Public Health Associations (WFPHA) has drawn on existing national competency frameworks to define public health practice, providing a ‘tool for international benchmarking of education and training programs and public health curricula’ [4 ]. The Charter provides a comprehensive set of elements grouped into public health services (Protection, Prevention, Promotion) and enabling functions (Governance, Information, Advocacy, Capacity) [7 ]. It does not, however, provide a set of actual competencies that can be applied to an educational programme. Therefore, the Charter's elements were used to give structure to the mapping of the competencies against the SDGs, carried out in this study. This project was designed to identify the extent to which competencies specific to the accomplishment of the SDGs are included in competency frameworks used for public health workforce education.  2 Methods The first stage of this review identified SDG targets of direct relevance to public health. Inclusion criteria covered topic areas relevant to tasks carried out by the existing public health workforce (see Supplemental Material). For example, all of SDG 3, ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’ , and many targets in SDG 6, ‘Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’ , include goals directly relevant to public health [1 ]. Of the total 169 SDG targets, 49 were considered directly relevant to public health and subsequently used in this review. To give clarity to the subsequent mapping of competencies against the SDG targets, the targets were first mapped against the Charter's elements, according to their content. In line with recommendations previously made elsewhere [4 ], several keywords were added to the Charter elements for this exercise, namely: ‘human rights’ to the Governance function; ‘culturally safe public health practice’, ‘systems thinking’ and ‘ethical practice’ to the Capacity function; and ‘one-health’ to the Protection element. Many SDG targets were assigned to more than one element, resulting in 92 entries being included in an Excel spreadsheet. Exclusion criteria covered targets of no direct relevance to public health (for example most of SDG 9, ‘Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation’ ). Previous work by members of the WFPHA's Professional Education and Training Working Group (PETWG) [4 ], identified several competency frameworks used in public health education settings, informing the selection of frameworks used in this study, noting that the ASPHER framework [8 ] used in the previous analysis, was replaced by the updated WHO-ASPHER version [2 ]. Also of note, the CEPH [9 ] framework is structured differently than the other frameworks, as it includes separate competency sets for Bachelor, Master and Doctorate degree levels. For consistency with the other frameworks, CEPH competencies relating to the Bachelor's degree were excluded for this study, and the Master and Doctorate degree levels were treated as separate sets. In summary, an analysis of nine publicly available competency sets was carried out, sourced from eight different competency frameworks, outlined in Table 1  . Most of the frameworks are applied in master or doctoral degree programme settings for the future public health workforce; however, a number are also intended for use in continuing professional development programmes [2 ,10 ]. While each framework groups its competencies into various domains or areas of practice, they differ in number of domains and competencies, as well as in the complexity of the supplementary information provided. Where provided, the underpinning knowledge included in some frameworks was excluded from this analysis, and only the competencies themselves included, to remain consistent with the other frameworks. The number of domains range from four [9 ] to 2311 , and the number of specific competencies from 209  to 154 [11 ]. Several frameworks also distinguish between knowledge- and practical-based competencies [11 ,12 ]. Where frameworks differentiated between different levels of achievement, e.g. competent, proficient and expert [2 ], the mapping only included the competencies themselves, and did not take into account the descriptors for the levels of achievement. To map the competencies against the SDG targets, the following simple coding frame was constructed to discern to what extent a competency covered the content of an SDG target (see Supplemental Material).[1] Fully or directly covers  [2] Partially covers    For a competency to be coded as a [1], or fully covering the content of an SDG target, the action word (e.g., ‘implement’) also needed to correlate. For example, a competency referring only to ‘knowledge’ of a certain element would be coded as a [2], if the SDG target in question referred to the ‘implementation’ of a component. The first author carried out the initial coding and mapping of the competencies, the results of which were then checked for consistency by two of the other team members. Discrepancies were identified and resolved using a discussion-based procedure until a consensus was reached. Most discrepancies were due to different understandings/meanings of words or terms. Overall, loosely worded competencies which were relevant but didn't explicitly refer to the exact topic area specified by the SDG target, were included rather than excluded. For example, a competency that referred to ‘manage policy implementation’ was mapped as a [2] against any SDG target that addressed any form of policymaking or policy implementation, even if it did not refer to the exact topic area specified by the target. The results of the SDG mapping were then quantified, using percentages to estimate the extent that issues outlined by the SDG targets are addressed by the competency sets.  3 Results Overall, very few competencies mapped directly to individual SDG targets. Instead, most mapped competencies only partially covered the content of the targets in question. Only four of the nine competency sets included competencies that fully or directly covered various SDG targets [2 ,10 ,11 ,13 ]. Table 2   demonstrates the quantified results of the mapping process for the [1] competencies fully or directly covering the SDG targets relevant to public health. Table 3   presents results for the [2] competencies that only partially cover the content of the SDG targets. Overall, most of the keywords identified for future inclusion in the Charter, namely ‘culturally safe practice’, ‘ethical practice’, ‘systems thinking’ and ‘one-health’ did not significantly impact the results, as in general more than a single keyword from the Charter was relevant to each target. Only four SDG targets were mapped more than once due to the addition of the new keywords, all of which related to ‘human rights.’ This finding demonstrates the importance of the possible amendments to the Charter. The level of coverage differed considerably between all competency sets. Of the 15 mapped competencies that fully or directly cover the content of the SDG targets in question, eight belonged to the GPHC [11 ] framework. As the name of this framework suggests, it addresses issues with a more global scope, and does not focus solely on a single national or regional context like most of the other frameworks. This is reflected in the mapping results, since the SDG targets tend to focus on challenges that more severely affect LMICs, such as human rights, poverty, food and water scarcity, and social and structural violence. These issues are primarily addressed explicitly by the GPHC [11 ], whilst in all other frameworks they are alluded to, at most. Regarding the mapped [2] competencies, or those that only partially cover the SDG targets in question, all competency sets mapped against at least several of the SDG targets (Table 3 ). Of the total 666 competencies from across all nine competency sets, 200 competencies were mapped as partially covering the SDG targets (30%). Of all the competency sets, the scope of coverage of SDG targets ranged from nine of 49 (18%) [14 ] to 49 of 49 (100%) [2 ,9 ]. Regarding coverage of the total number of SDG entries (92), here the two CEPH [9 ] and the WHO-ASPHER [2 ] competency sets also achieved the highest coverage, with 100% of SDG target entries having competencies mapped against them. However, it must be pointed out that this was primarily due to three competencies, one from each competency set, that referred to applying a ‘systems thinking’ approach. As systems thinking was considered a relevant competency for all the SDG targets in question, these three competencies were mapped against all SDG target entries. Initially, the question was raised as to what problems require systems thinking and what not. All authors agreed that because the SDGs address a host of complex, interrelated and intersectoral issues, systems thinking would be required to achieve them. Of the Charter elements, results showed that of the enabling functions, Governance was the element with the most SDG targets and competencies mapped against it, whilst for the service elements, Protection was the element with the highest coverage (Table 4  ); 24% of the SDG target entries were mapped against the Governance element of the Charter, and a further 24% against the Protection element.  4 Discussion This study was designed to estimate the coverage of the relevant SDGs by competency sets used to educate the public health workforce as part of postgraduate or professional development programmes. Over half of the mapped [1] competencies were from the GPHC [11 ] framework, which is likely due to its more global scope. Few competencies that were considered as fully or directly covering an SDG target could be mapped, with only four of the nine competency sets including mapped [1] competencies. As the SDGs include many specific issues relevant to LMICs, such as human rights and food and water scarcity, these are barely addressed by the remaining competency frameworks, all of which were written in HIC contexts. The lack of competency frameworks written in LMIC contexts remains an ongoing challenge, as previously noted by others [4 ,5 ]. The results of this study have reinforced this observation and demonstrated the relevance of this project's findings in the context of sustainable development, where urgent action is needed to address the issues anchored in the SDGs, many of which disproportionally affect LMICs. In addition, this analysis has reiterated the importance of rectifying identified gaps in the Charter by incorporating keywords such as ‘human rights’, particularly if the Charter is to be used as a foundational framework for ‘public health systems to communicate globally, compare capacity and improve performance’ [7 ], as was originally intended. The GPHC [11 ] is the only framework to include competencies that explicitly address issues such as gender mainstreaming, structural and social violence, human rights, migration, and the SDGs. In the other frameworks these issues are at most included within the underpinning knowledge or performance requirements sections, but in many cases not at all. This highlights the importance of the context and target audience of the frameworks in use. Due to its global scope, the GPHC [11 ] explicitly addresses a range of issues that affect both LMICs and HICs. The other frameworks tend to include content more directly related to their own national or regional context. However, to achieve many of the SDGs, action is needed from all countries, and not only from those disproportionally affected by the issues themselves. In many cases, the SDGs even explicitly state the need for international cooperation and capacity-building support for LMICs [1 ]. Beyond the scope of the topic areas addressed, the importance of evaluating the type of language used in competency frameworks is highlighted. Overall, the SDG targets use specific language to explicitly address public health issues (e.g., ‘access to sexual and reproductive health services’). In contrast, except for the GPHC [11 ], the competency frameworks tend to apply broad and unspecific wording to allow for applicability in different contexts (e.g., ‘health programmes and preventative services’). This imprecise language resulted in few matches when mapping the [1] competencies. This raises the question of how context-specific or detailed a competency framework should be. Competencies worded in a broad manner may be useful as they can be more easily applied in different contexts and fields of practice. However, lack of specific wording may contrarily result in important issues (e.g., ‘violence’) not being addressed in education programmes for the public health workforce. This appears to be the case with many of the issues outlined by the SDGs. Although the SDGs also set broad goals, the wording used in the targets is quite specific regarding the exact topic area where change is necessary. Nevertheless, it is possible that in practice these issues may be incorporated into education programmes even if they are not present in the competency frameworks. Additionally, it is important to note that sometimes issues, such as ‘human rights’, were not present in the competencies themselves, but in other sections of the frameworks such as the ‘elements of competence’, the ‘underpinning knowledge’ or the ‘glossary of terms’. Others such as ‘violence’, were not present in any sections of any of the frameworks, except the GPHC [11 ]. Overall, the authors argue that many problems identified in the SDGs are insufficiently incorporated into public health competency frameworks. Confusion also occurred around the application of certain elements, because of a lack of consensus around the meaning and intent of specific competency terms. Although initially the meaning of various terms may seem clear, such as the increasingly popular ‘universal health coverage’, different understandings of what this entails may still result. For example, although many HICs will claim to have achieved universal health coverage due to their social health protection systems financed by either taxes or formal contributions, which in principle include all citizens, they may fail to address the system's lack of true universality due to other issues. The rural-urban divide in accessing care, or exclusion from the benefits of a social healthcare system due to lack of formal employment and inability to pay the necessary contributions, are both factors that may result in a system's coverage not being truly universal. For example, Germany's healthcare system is frequently cited as providing universal health coverage. However, since access to benefits is linked to formal contributions made, some population groups, such as unemployed or homeless people, may fall through the cracks and be excluded from access to this ‘universal’ healthcare [15 ]. Although the same terminology may be used, it can be interpreted or understood entirely differently, depending on the context in which it is applied. It may seem overly pedantic to focus on the implicit meaning of such terms, however, for these to be used consistently within competency frameworks for public health education programmes, a common understanding must be reached. The definition of terms and the accompanying background information remain essential parts of a comprehensive competency framework. Another term that posed a challenge to reaching a common understanding was ‘systems thinking’. Three of the competency sets [2 ,9 ] directly referred to the application of systems thinking, resulting in these competencies being mapped against all 92 of the SDG target entries. Although the term seems straightforward, which SDG targets a ‘systems thinking’ approach would apply to, and its relevance to the entire SDG framework, the Charter, and all public health competency sets, is questionable. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the SDGs, and the need for multisectoral action for sustainable development, it can be argued that systems thinking should be applied in the implementation of all the SDGs [16 ]. Furthermore, systems thinking is not only important for sustainable development, but also the public health sector, making it noteworthy that only three of the nine competency sets analysed refer to it at all. A further observation is the high proportion of competencies mapped to the Charter's elements of Governance and Protection. The focus on Protection is unsurprising given the Global North tends to pay particular attention to health issues only when they are deemed ‘crises’, such as outbreaks of infectious diseases or threats from the Global South [17 ,18 ]. Although infectious diseases are addressed by both the SDGs and the competency frameworks, the type and scope of included diseases is very different. The competencies tend to refer to disease control and emergency preparedness, from a more pandemic-focused perspective, whilst all except the GPHC [11 ] fail to include communicable diseases addressed by the SDGs, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria and tuberculosis, that continue to disproportionally affect LMICs. This finding also does not echo the true global burden of disease, which is largely determined by non-communicable diseases [19 ]. When it comes to sustainable development, other elements of health, such as Promotion, should arguably be weighted just as highly within competency frameworks as the element of Protection. Regarding the underlying functions, Governance may be most prominently featured in the context of sustainable development, as the SDGs include many issues that are cross-sectoral in nature and require legislative action. This study is not without its limitations. These include the possibility of measurement error, since the mapping process required the competencies to be interpreted by the authors, leading to possible variations in the understanding of each respective competency. Additionally, competencies were only coded as [1] competencies if they fully or directly covered the SDG target in question. If two separate competencies from one framework each partially covered the content of a target, together equalling full coverage, they were still individually mapped as [2] competencies. The decision to include only SDG targets directly related to public health practice is also questionable, as arguably most SDGs are relevant to public health in some manner, albeit in an indirect way; for example, the relationship between economic growth and health. Lastly, the lack of available frameworks from LMIC contexts also means the results of this analysis primarily provide an overview of sustainable development from HIC lens.  5 Conclusions This is the first study of its kind, and has highlighted critical gaps in the attention given to the SDGs, within competency sets intended to guide the content of education programmes for the public health workforce. If achieving the SDGs remains high on the global and public health agenda, then relevant competencies must be included in existing and future frameworks, to reflect the importance of sustainable development. In addition to the amendment of the national and regional frameworks included in this analysis, the authors suggest a new revised set of competencies is needed, that is more globally applicable. To be of any value, this new framework would need to include both competencies and underpinning knowledge specific to the SDGs and issues that continue to disproportionally affect LMICs.
