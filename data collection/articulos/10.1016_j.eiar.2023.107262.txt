                  Understanding the intricate connections between ecosystem services (ESs) and resident well-being (RWB) is critical to managing ESs and achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, it is difficult to quantify the impact mechanism between different ESs and RWB. We constructed a theoretical framework to analyze the impact mechanism of ESs on RWB under SDGs. We sought to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of ESs and RWB in Shanghai at the district scale and then explored the impact mechanism of ESs on RWB using a structural equation model (SEM). Results show that habitat quality, carbon storage capacity, food availability, and cultural services declined from 2000 to 2020. The level of RWB in the central urban area was higher than that in the suburbs. Material satisfaction grew in most districts but declined somewhat in Huangpu, Chongming. Spiritual fulfillment declined in most districts while it increased in Changning, Hongkou, and Pudong. Health and social relations improved in most districts, but the safety in suburbs has decreased. Supporting services directly promoted regulating services and cultural services but inhibited provisioning services. Cultural services had a negative impact on regulating services and provisioning services. Regulating services promoted provisioning services and suppressed cultural services while provisioning services promoted cultural services greatly and suppressed regulating services. Regulating and cultural services directly promoted the RWB, and provisioning services had an inhibitory effect on it. Supporting services indirectly promoted the RWB by promoting regulating and cultural services, while it suppressed the provisioning services to reduce the negative impact on RWB, it is crucial for improving RWB. Accordingly, we proposed several spatially targeted ecological measures. Community ecological parks should be constructed to promote the variety, stability, and sustainability of ecosystems in downtown areas. Supporting services should be improved by targeting habitat quality capacity to manage and restore the ecological environment. The cultural and tourism infrastructure of country parks in the suburbs should be improved to provide more employment opportunities and high-quality cultural services. The ecological compensation mechanism and market trading mechanism should be optimized to shorten the transition period of the ecological economy.

School of International and Public Affairs Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai 200030 China       Understanding the intricate connections between ecosystem services (ESs) and resident well-being (RWB) is critical to managing ESs and achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, it is difficult to quantify the impact mechanism between different ESs and RWB. We constructed a theoretical framework to analyze the impact mechanism of ESs on RWB under SDGs. We sought to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of ESs and RWB in Shanghai at the district scale and then explored the impact mechanism of ESs on RWB using a structural equation model (SEM). Results show that habitat quality, carbon storage capacity, food availability, and cultural services declined from 2000 to 2020. The level of RWB in the central urban area was higher than that in the suburbs. Material satisfaction grew in most districts but declined somewhat in Huangpu, Chongming. Spiritual fulfillment declined in most districts while it increased in Changning, Hongkou, and Pudong. Health and social relations improved in most districts, but the safety in suburbs has decreased. Supporting services directly promoted regulating services and cultural services but inhibited provisioning services. Cultural services had a negative impact on regulating services and provisioning services. Regulating services promoted provisioning services and suppressed cultural services while provisioning services promoted cultural services greatly and suppressed regulating services. Regulating and cultural services directly promoted the RWB, and provisioning services had an inhibitory effect on it. Supporting services indirectly promoted the RWB by promoting regulating and cultural services, while it suppressed the provisioning services to reduce the negative impact on RWB, it is crucial for improving RWB. Accordingly, we proposed several spatially targeted ecological measures. Community ecological parks should be constructed to promote the variety, stability, and sustainability of ecosystems in downtown areas. Supporting services should be improved by targeting habitat quality capacity to manage and restore the ecological environment. The cultural and tourism infrastructure of country parks in the suburbs should be improved to provide more employment opportunities and high-quality cultural services. The ecological compensation mechanism and market trading mechanism should be optimized to shorten the transition period of the ecological economy.

With the increasing frequency of natural disasters, extreme weather, and large-scale epidemics (IPCC, 2022 ), approximately 60% of global ecosystem services (ESs) (15 out of 24) were already deteriorated or are unsustainable. This is seriously threatening human development and affecting resident well-being (RWB). It has been shown that global urban expansion will result in the loss of >80% of the earth's habitat in the future (Chen, 2020 ) and a concomitant decline in species richness (Li et al., 2022 ; Liang and Song, 2022 ). Promoting sustainable human development has become a major global challenge. Therefore, the United Nations published 17 sustainable development objectives (SDGs) that the world desperately needs to accomplish by 2030 (United Nations (UN), 2023 ; Jahan, 2015 ). The SDGs aimed to promote RWB, i.e., to meet the material and spiritual needs of present and future generations (Wu et al., 2014 ). âThe Global Land Project (GLP)â and âThe Future Earth Program (FEP)â also made the relationship between ESs and RWB an important part of their research (Cheng et al., 2021 ). ESs are the natural environmental conditions and utilities that ecosystems and ecological processes create and maintain for humans to survive and thrive (Daily, 1997 ). These include provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that directly affect people and the supporting services needed to maintain other services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), 2005 ; Wang and Lu, 2005 ). RWB is a multidimensional notion with objective and subjective aspects (Cruz-Garcia et al., 2017 ). Objective well-being includes social and material attributes, whereas subjective well-being refers to an individual's evaluation of their situation (Smith et al., 2013 ; King et al., 2014 ; Ma et al., 2022 ). The sustainable development goals (SDGs) provided detailed and multifaceted insights into RWB in terms of economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable conditions. SDGs were, to this effect, the official basis for assessing indicators of RWB (Qiu et al., 2022 ). Ecosystems provide food and water, shelter, and energy for heating, meeting the basic residents' needs for survival. Regulating services such as flood regulation, climate regulation, and carbon sequestration can reduce air pollution, urban drought, and flooding, meeting residents' safety and health well-being. Cultural services such as natural scenic values, scientific and educational humanistic values, and recreational values can satisfy residents' spiritual well-being (Fagerholm et al., 2020 ). Supporting services such as biodiversity and soil conservation services are the basis for the formation of other services that directly affect resident well-being (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), 2005 ). Thus, ESs are the resource and environmental basis for residents' survival and development, they are directly related to SDGs 6, 13, 14, and 15 and indirectly contribute to the other 13 goals (IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), 2016 ; ICSU, 2015 ; Vasseur et al., 2017 ). Prioritizing ESs management and restoration will contribute to significant progress toward the 17 SDGs, hence improving RWB across several dimensions. The decoupling of ESs governance from SDGs led to an imbalance in RWB. High-value single ESs and low SDG scores coexisted in certain regions (Xu et al., 2020 ; Chen et al., 2021 ). Despite the interconnectedness of various kinds of ecosystems, study and management efforts across departments have been generally uncoordinated and inadvertently detrimental to global sustainability. A reductionist emphasis on the separate components of an integrated socio-ecological system ignores important interactions between system components (Reyers and Selig, 2020 ). Individual system components, such as air, biodiversity, energy, food, land, water, and people, were often isolated in research and management (Liu et al., 2015 ). In general, ecological governance goals lag behind economic development goals, causing an imbalance between environmental and economic well-being, weakening other goals supported by environment-related goals, and slowing the improvement of multidimensional RWB (Reyers and Selig, 2020 ). Environmental governance goals set under SDGs should be thoroughly considered for the management and restoration of ESs. Further, the impact of environmental goals on other goals should be used to improve RWB. A more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between ESs and RWB is necessary to reveal the effects of ecosystem composition and function. This knowledge may also reveal suitable measures to balance their contributions to RWB while minimizing the negative effects of anthropogenic activities for effective, sustainable ecosystem management (McMichael et al., 2005 ; Howe et al., 2014 ; Huynh et al., 2022 ). The most widely used frameworks to conceptualize the complex relationships between ESs and RWB include the MA framework (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), 2005 ), which constitutes a broadly applied foundational framework that links four categories of ESs with five components of well-being (Liu et al., 2021b ; Figueroa and Pasten, 2014 ; Sannigrahi et al., 2021 ). However, using the MA to analyze these connections may overlook issues related to social differentiation and political economics (Fisher et al., 2014 ); the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) (Scoones, 1998 ), its focus is livelihood rather than well-being; and the Cascading Model of Ecosystem Services (CMES) (Haines-Young and Potschin, 2010 ). Although the above frameworks can reveal the impact of ESs on RWB to some degree, they have certain limitations regarding the real-world alignment with SDGs. ESs provides an important perspective for urban governance and decision-making, and the ES approach is considered a great opportunity to achieve SDGs. Rozas-VÃ¡squez developed a framework to make explicit the links among development objectives, sustainability goals, and the overall dependency on the ESs supply (Rozas-VÃ¡squez et al., 2019 ). It is unclear how to achieve the multidimensional RWB set in the SDGs in unison through ESs management strategies, and it is difficult to satisfy landscape planning goals. Though many scholars have used these frameworks to construct hypotheses, few have tested the relationships between ESs and RWB (Cruz-Garcia et al., 2017 ). In addition, the strength of the connection between ESs and RWB and the management potential both depend on the ecosystem and geospatial region (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), 2005 ). For example, Some scholars have explored the relationship between ecosystems and farmers' well-being using SEM models finding that food supplying services, soil conservation, and sand fixation had a stronger impact on the farmers' well-being (Zhang et al., 2021 ; Qiu et al., 2022 ), because their economic resources and material satisfaction were more dependent on providing and regulating services (Bruley et al., 2021 ). There were group differences in the impacts of ESs on the RWB. Access to ESs differs among purely agricultural, part-time, and non-agricultural groups, resulting in different direct and indirect effects of ESs on the groups' well-being, and the direct effect was stronger than the indirect effect of different groups (Zoderer et al., 2019 ; Liu et al., 2022 ). The increasing density of people and industries in metropolitan areas has increased the need for ESs (Zhou et al., 2022 ), as urban residents mainly engage in the secondary and tertiary industries, they have a greater demand for clean air, clean drinking water, and leisure and entertainment opportunities in contact with nature nowadays (Lankia et al., 2015 ; Romagosa, 2018 ; Shi et al., 2020 ). However, <10% of studies have focused on the urban, county, or community scale (Cruz-Garcia et al., 2017 ). It is necessary to explore the state of ESs and RWB and the relationships between them in the metropolitan area (Huynh et al., 2022 ) to respond to designers' and decision-makers' demands for sustainable ecosystem management and restoration. In this study, we developed a framework to analyze the impact mechanism of ESs on RWB in the context of the SDGs. Based on the framework of linking the MA and SDGs, we mapped the spatiotemporal evolution pattern of major ESs and RWB from 2000 to 2020 at the district scale and then used a structural equation model (SEM) to analyze the impact mechanism of ESs on RWB. Finally, we discussed the underlying driving factors of RWB from ESs. Our main research questions are: (1) What are the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of ESs and RWB in metropolitan areas at the district scale? (2) What is the intensity and direction of the effect of ESs on the RWB? (3) What are the priorities for the management and recovery of ESs to improve the multidimensional RWB set in SDGs in urban and suburban areas? The primary contribution of this work is linking the governance of ESs to SDGs to correct the imbalance between economic, social, and environmental goals. In terms of ESs evaluation, we studied the evolution of cultural ecosystem services in metropolitan areas, which supplemented the lack of research on non-material ecosystem services. In terms of RWB assessment, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted from multiple dimensions including material satisfaction, spiritual fulfillment, health, safety, and good social relationships to reveal the evolution of the RWB over the past 20Â years. The assessment of RWB at the district level helped to reveal the differences between the downtown and suburbs in metropolitan areas. Through causal relationship testing, the trade-off and synergy between supporting services, regulating services, and cultural services were revealed. The direct or indirect impact intensity and direction of the four types of ESs on RWB were analyzed, so the key ESs were identified. The results can provide theoretical support for ecological space governance and key ecosystem restoration that aims at RWB improvement in different districts. What's more, the case study of Shanghai, China can provide a reference for ecological space governance in other international metropolitan areas.  2 Study area and theoretical framework 2.1 Study area Shanghai is located on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean (30Â°23â²N-31Â°27â²N and 120Â°52â²-E121Â°45â²E), along the eastern boundary of the Asian continent, at the junction of China's northern and southern coasts, and the convergence of the Yangtze and Huangpu Rivers (Fig. 1   (a)). Shanghai has a subtropical rainy environment and an elevation of 2.19Â m on average. It has four different seasons, plenty of sunlight, and plenty of rain. The rainfall in 2020 was 1597.1Â mm. The river network mainly includes the Huangpu River and its tributaries, such as the Suzhou River, Chuanyang River, and Dianpu River, which flow through the urban area. The islets to the east of Shanghai have extensive marshes and mudflats. These are significant migratory bird sites as well as ecological obstacles in Shanghai (Fig. 1 (b)). Shanghai is a municipality directly under the central government of China, a national central city and the core city of a metropolitan area, and belongs to China's international economic, financial, trade, and technology innovation center, as well as a historical and cultural city. In 2020, Shanghai's GDP was 38,700.58 billion yuan, continuing to rank first in China, with the city's per capita disposable income reaching 2008 yuan (2021 Shanghai Statistical Yearbook). Its economic growth, growth potential, and the development prospects of people's lives rank first in the country. There are 16 districts in Shanghai, including Huangpu, Xuhui, Changning, Jing'an, Putuo, Hongkou, and Yangpu districts in the central city, and Minhang, Baoshan, Jiading, Jinshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, Fengxian, and Chongming districts in the suburbs. Pudong New District is far ahead in terms of economic volume, followed by Huangpu District, Minhang District, and Jiading District, while Chongming District has a smaller economic volume. In 2020, the permanent population of Shanghai was 2.49 million, of which the proportion of the migrant population was 1.05 million, accounting for 42.09%. The population density was 3925 people/km 2   . From a regional perspective, the population in the central urban area accounted for 26.9%, the population in Pudong accounted for 22.8%, the population in other suburbs accounted for 50.3%, and the population urbanization rate reached 89.3%. Shanghai also has serious ecological space scarcity and fragmentation, which has a huge ecological deficit and huge demand for ecological services. The scarcity of ecological resources hinders the improvement of RWB and sustainable development (Zhou et al., 2022 ). Shanghai is a typical metropolis facing the problem of imbalance development between the social and natural systems. How to promote the harmonious and unified development of people and nature, form a high-quality pattern, and meeting the increasing demand of residents for ESs is the current challenge facing Shanghai. Previous studies of ESs in Shanghai have been limited to one ecological land type or one administrative area (Shen, 2011 ; Cao et al., 2017 ; Chen, 2020 ) and did not investigate the impact mechanism of ESs on RWB. Thus, it is crucial to quantify the relationship between ESs and RWB in Shanghai, we selected 16 districts of Shanghai as our basic research unit (Fig. 1 (c)).  2.2 Data source Multiple data from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were utilized to assess key ESs, including land-use types, meteorological and topographic data, vegetation indices, and socioeconomic information. The district Statistical Yearbook and the Statistical Yearbook of the National Economic and Social Development (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020), which included per capita income, grain production, environmental indicators, and other factors, were used to assess RWB. All data were projected to the WGS84 coordinate system. More details on the multi-source data are listed in Table 1  .  2.3 Impact mechanism of ESs on resident well-being aligned with SDGs Although all 17 SDGs are related directly or indirectly to ecosystem management and governance, goals 6, 13, 14, and 15 are especially relevant. These four are critical to achieving the other goals and call for a new paradigm of ecosystem governance. Environmental goals provide direction for ES governance, encouraging the management and governance of ecosystems using a collaborative, multi-goal, cross-sectoral model. These goals are critical for achieving other objectives by accumulating material resources and are designed to increase multidimensional RWB. The MA framework reveals the strength of the links between various ESs and various aspects of RWB, as well as the ability to manage these links utilizing socioeconomic factors. We linked the SDGs with the MA by embedding the multidimensional RWB proposed under the SDGs into the RWB portion of the MA. This strategy can reveal which RWB item in the SDGs can be achieved through ES governance (Fig. 2  ). Based on Fig. 2 , We constructed a hypothetical model to reveal the complex causal relationship between ESs and RWB (Fig. 3  ). Various ES provisions are independent variables, i.e., supporting services. The five integrated sub-components of RWB (material satisfaction, health, security, spiritual fulfillment, and social relations) are combined into one independent variable.   3 Methods 3.1 Quantifying ecological services Policymakers are tasked with alleviating the contradiction between economic development and ecological degradation in metropolitan areas while providing residents with high quality of life. We evaluated the supply of important ESs pertinent to Shanghai's economic growth or severe ecological issues. Due to the complexity of ecosystem service processes and functions, and the non-marketability of ecosystem services value, ecosystem services are not fully utilized by humans. Only a small number of measurable core ecosystem services can considerably improve people's lives or contribute significantly to the sustainability of the region's development (Qiu et al., 2022 ). We selected food supply, carbon storage, habitat quality, and cultural ecosystem services for the following reasons. (1) Adequate food and fresh water resources are the most important ecosystem provisioning services. Available and adequate supply requires food (including entitlements), nutrition, and energy for a healthy life, including access to stable food reserves during poor months or periods of material/economic instability (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2023 ). Shanghai is a densely populated city with a high demand for food. Although food supplies are mainly dependent on rural areas, the city must be relatively self-sufficient for perishable foods such as vegetables and fruits to prevent shortages in times of instability (e.g., during epidemics). Which is a fundamental and long-term factor limiting Shanghai's potential development (Shi et al., 2020 ). Shanghai is rich in total freshwater resources; thus, we selected food supply as a representative service. (2) Habitat quality is the most important supporting service. Habitat quality is related to soil conservation, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and primary production, which is the premise and foundation of all ecosystem functions and services and is also the key to improving human well-being and ensuring ecological security. Thus, we selected habitat quality as relevant supporting services. (3) Due to the concentration of population and industries, high carbon emissions, and the urgent demand for healthy air from urban residents, local climate regulation is the most important regulating service in Shanghai. In addition, to mitigate extreme global climate change, and actively promote China's goal of âcarbon peak and carbon neutralityâ, carbon emissions reduction and carbon absorption increase have become important tasks for the Shanghai Municipal Government during the 14th Five-Year Plan period. Land cover and soil pool are important determinants of carbon stocks of terrestrial ecosystem services (Zaehle et al., 2007 ), and transitions between different land cover/use types cause changes in carbon stocks. Carbon stock changes have an important role in mitigating the greenhouse effect by affecting carbon emissions and greenhouse gas concentrations through transformation and cyclic mechanisms(Ito et al., 2016 ). In particular, increases in carbon storage in woody biomass (e.g., forest ecosystems) are widely recognized as having high climate mitigation potential. Locally, areas with high values of soil carbon storage in nature reserves have a significant cooling effect on local climate regulation in the region (Liu et al., 2021a ). So carbon storage can be used as an important assessment indicator for regulating services to reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of carbon storage capacity, as well as the areas to focus on improving carbon storage in the future. (4) Cultural ecosystem services represent non-material dimensions of the relationship between humans and nature. They include recreational activities, spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, social relations, aesthetic value, and existential value (Alcamo et al., 2003 ; Chan et al., 2012 ; Gould et al., 2015 ; Zapata-Caldas et al., 2022 ). Cultural ecosystem services are mainly generated through four channels of interaction between humans and nature: form, cultural practice, intellectual practice, and spiritual practice. Form refers to the interaction between humans and nature through the physical and tangible aspects of the ecosystem, including a sense of locality, identity, fear, and stimulating formation. Interaction with nature via cultural activities offers an opportunity for recreation, exercise, and expression, as well as the production, care, and consumption of natural resources. The term intellectual practice describes the interaction with nature, providing a setting for learning and acquiring new information. Contact with nature offers opportunities for spiritual and religious pursuits and is referred to as spiritual practice (Huynh et al., 2022 ). We considered cultural ecosystem services one of Shanghai's most urgent needs, as residents of metropolitan urban areas had very little contact with natural ecosystems (Wang et al., 2021 ), and an influential development objective in the era of the knowledge economy. We contend that cultivated land, forest land, and grassland can provide cultural ecosystem services to residents. The supply of cultural ecosystem services can be measured by the area of green space in the region's district. Table 2   lists the processes we used to calculate the ESs.  3.2 Quantifying resident well-being Objective well-being is assessed by selecting social and economic indicators that can be easily counted on a society-wide scale and reflect people's living conditions, such as the Human Development Index (HDI) constructed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) based on a capacity assessment framework, which is a widely used system of objective well-being assessment indicators, including income, education, and life expectancy. In addition, another study has also assessed human well-being in Pakistan's 100 administrative districts in 2006â2007 in terms of four dimensions: education, health, living conditions, and economic circumstances (Haq, 2009 ). This study focuses on assessing the objective well-being of residents in each district of Shanghai, revealing the differences in RWB in urban and suburban areas so that socioeconomic statistics data are obtained at the district scales in Shanghai. The indicators for assessing the RWB in the MA are the basis of this study, we established an assessment indicator for RWB by incorporating SDGs goals into the MA framework while taking into consideration the area's economic and social characteristics, previous studies, and data accessibility (Fig. 2 ). The five dimensions of RWB in the MA framework serve as primary indicators and seven secondary indicators are selected based on SDGs (Table 3  ). Compared to the previous study, income, and living area are introduced as the foundation for personal material well-being. Education and technical requirements are introduced, as they contribute to personal psychological happiness (Wang et al., 2017 ), and the fundamental spiritual needs of urban inhabitants. Good social relationships can be measured by the frequency of crime and the nuclear density of coffee shops (Weinstein et al., 2015 ). The freedom of choice and action is difficult to quantify with data, so this indicator has been abandoned. We use the entropy method to assign weights after data normalization.  3.3 Exploring the impact mechanism of ESs on resident well-being Using AMOS 22.0 software to run structural equation models (SEM), SEM is a multivariate statistical technique for describing direct and indirect causative relationships between numerous factors. Causal relationships are displayed by arrow (path) directions in the model (Lefcheck, 2016 ). The ESs (supporting services, provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural ecosystem services) and RWB are latent variables. The measurement variables of regulating services, supporting services, and provisioning services are carbon storage, habitat quality, and food supply, respectively. The cultural ecosystem services are directly measured. The measurement variables for each type of ESs in each district are obtained from the average ecosystem service supply in each district. The measurement variables of RWB are material satisfaction, health, safety, spiritual fulfillment, and social relations (Fig. 3 ). The samples for the 16 districts in Shanghai from 2000 to 2020 is 80, which satisfies the requirement that the samples should be at least five times the number of paths to be estimated in the model (Grace and Keeley, 2006 ), and the year as a control variable. Our hypotheses are as follows:H1 The supporting services contributed directly to provisioning services, contributed directly to regulating services, and contributed directly to cultural ecosystem services.  H2 The provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural ecosystem services interacted with each other.  H3 All provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural ecosystem services affected RWB directly.  H4 The supporting services had an indirect impact on RWB by directly influencing provisioning services, regulating services, and cultural ecosystem services.   We tested these hypotheses using the SEM, the formula is as follows:(1) w = Î² 1  Ã w 1  + Î² 2  Ã w 2  + Î¶    where w   is a dependent variable (resident well-being); w 1    is an independent variable (e.g., cultural ecosystem services); Î² 1    is the effect of w 1    on w  , which are measured using the regression coefficient and their significance levels (Cheung, 2014 ); Î² 2    is the relationship between w 2    and w  ; Î¶   is the random error. In addition, the measurement model components of the SEM were used to analyze the causal relationship between observed variables and their corresponding latent variable respectively, the formula is as follows:(2) x 1  = Î» 1  Ã w 1  + e 1     (3) x 2  = Î» 2  Ã w 2  + e 2     where w 1    and w 2    are the dependent variable and independent variable in formula (1) ; x 1    is the observed variable in w 1   , e.g., soil conservation; x 2    is the observed variable in w 2   , e.g., spiritual fulfillment; Î» 1    and Î» 1    are the factor loading matrices of the observed variables on their latent variables; e 1    and e 2    are random errors.   4 Results 4.1 Spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of ecosystem services The supporting services habitat quality in Shanghai decreased from 2000 to 2020, and areas with the âworstâ and âpoorâ levels increased. The spatial pattern results suggest that habitat quality was low in the core city and favorable in suburban districts. Due to rapid urbanization, areas with poor levels of habitat quality radiated outward and extended from the downtown to the suburbs. From 2000 to 2010, the surrounding areas of the central urban area experienced severe degradation, including Baoshan, Jiading, the northeast of Qingpu, the northwest of Pudong, Minhang District, and Jinshan. The areas with severe degradation from 2010 to 2020 included the eastern part of Pudong New Area, Jinshan, and Fengxian. Chongming, Qingpu, and Songjiang experienced similar but less intense degradation (Fig. 4 (a) ). In terms of regulating services, carbon storage declined in Shanghai. The spatial pattern of carbon storage showed a trend of decreasing from the downtown to the suburbs (Fig. 4 (b)). From 2000 to 2010, the surrounding areas of the central urban area experienced severe degradation, including Baoshan, Minhang, the northeast of Jinshan, and the southwest of Pudong New Area. From 2010 to 2020, the carbon storage of the above districts continued to decrease and expand outward. In terms of provisioning services, grain yield was reduced in all nine suburbs from 2000 to 2020, and the production of major grain-producing areas decreased by two levels (Fig. 4 (c)). The spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services revealed low cultural services in core urban regions and high cultural services in suburban areas, with a downward trend in the supply. From 2000 to 2010, there was no significant change in cultural services, while from 2010 to 2020, cultural services in suburban areas decreased by 3â4 levels, while those in central urban areas decreased by 1â2 levels. In 2020, the cultural services in the central urban area and Pudong New Area were relatively high (Fig. 4 (d)).  4.2 Spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of resident well-being From 2000 to 2020, the overall RWB in Shanghai showed an upward trend, with a decline in Jiading District, Baoshan District, Jinshan District, and Qingpu District. The RWB in the downtown area was significantly higher than that in the suburbs. The districts where RWB was gradually improving include Huangpu, Putuo, Hongkou, and Pudong New Area (Fig. 5 (a) ). Specifically, the material satisfaction of various districts fluctuated greatly in different years, it was higher in the central urban area than that in the suburbs(Fig. 5 (b)). Material satisfaction was lower in Putuo District in the central urban area, and lower in Chongming District in the suburbs. Changning, Putuo, Hongkou, Minhang, Pudong New Area, and Fengxian District were showing a gradual upward trend. Due to the merger of some districts and counties in Huangpu, Jing'an, and Pudong New Area, material satisfaction has fluctuated. Xuhui and Jing'an exhibited higher material satisfaction due to their higher per capita GDP (SDG 8.1), per capita disposable income (SDG 1.1), and large per capita residential area (SDG 11.1) (Fig. 6 (a) ). Overall, compared to the suburbs, the industrial development in the central urban area was earlier, accumulating capital and resources. The commercial economic model has transformed and upgraded in different periods, and now the central urban area has gathered many large commercial districts and high-end residential communities. At the same time, the central urban areas had a profound historical and cultural heritage, abundant educational resources, and numerous employment opportunities, drawing many population aggregations, thereby creating high consumer demand, activating the market economy, and making residents relatively affluent in material terms. Putuo District was one of the early industrial bases of modern Shanghai, gathering a large number of workers and wage-earners, but the slow industrial transformation and population migration also led to its inactive economic development. For reasons of the Yangtze River barrier and historical zoning, the development of Chongming District was aimed at agriculture and ecological industry, and the residents were mostly agricultural producers and migrant workers, so the residents had low material well-being. The spiritual fulfillment of each district fluctuated greatly in different years, and the difference between suburbs and urban areas was relatively small(Fig. 5 (c)). The majority of the city's spiritual fulfillment declined, especially in most suburbs, which can be partially attributed to its rapid population increase and a decrease in per capita public service capacity. In the central urban area, there were improvements in Huangpu, Hongkou, and Pudong New Area, while in the suburbs, there were improvements in Chongming. Huangpu, Hongkou, and Pudong New Area showed a high level of spiritual fulfillment due to their higher levels of education (SDG 4) and expenditure on science and technology (SDG 9.5), as well as a high number of cultural facilities (SDG 4.7) (Fig. 6 (b)). The richer historical and cultural sites and educational resources of the central city made its residents more spiritually satisfied. The urbanization of Pudong New Area has progressed significantly over the decades, with the transformation of industrial industries into financial and technological industries, and a large population migration resulting in a strong demand for land. Many rural and agricultural lands were occupied for housing and modern public services improving the spiritual well-being of the residents. However, Hongkou featured a large number of residential areas, including famous people's homes, and a deep historical and cultural heritage. Due to its lack of a clear development strategy, relatively conservative economic development, and an aging population, residents had a relatively low demand for various cultural and entertainment needs. Government investment and development efforts have accelerated its development in recent years. Over the past 20Â years, there have also been significant fluctuations in safety across districts in different years, with most central areas showing an upward trend, and safety in urban areas slightly higher than in suburban areas(Fig. 5 (d)). With the development and construction of the central city, Shanghai's transportation construction and environmental management capabilities improved greatly. The government was striving to build subways and parks and improved urban noise and greenery coverage so that safety has been greatly enhanced. Jing'an District showed a gradual downward trend, the suburbs of Jiading, Jinshan, Qingpu, and Chongming show a downward trend, while Minhang, Songjiang, and Fengxian showed an upward trend (Fig. 6 (c)). This is because the suburbs had high green coverage, a better ecological environment, and less noise pollution, whereas the construction land expansion continuously encroached on ecological land, and urban commercial development also increased noise pollution, which reduced the safety of suburbs. The overall health level of Shanghai showed an upward trend, with small fluctuations in each district. The health of the central urban area was higher than that of the suburbs(Fig. 5 (e)). In the central urban area, areas with higher health included Huangpu and Xuhui districts, while in the suburbs, areas with higher health included Minhang District and Jinshan District (Fig. 6 (d)). Compared with the suburbs, the central city had more hospital beds and health technicians, medical resources and health equipment were more cash-developed, and residents had more convenient access to medical care. Although there was a higher incidence rate of infectious diseases in central urban areas, the cure rate was relatively higher than that in suburbs, and the average life expectancy was also relatively long. The social relations (SDG 10.2) in the central urban area of Shanghai have slightly decreased and fluctuated greatly, while the social relations in the suburbs have slightly increased and fluctuated less(Fig. 5 (f)). Good social relationships were more prominent in the central urban area, where positive social relations often indicate positive social interactions and strong social relationships while maintaining good social security. However, it is important to note that social relations in Putuo and Hongkou districts were gradually deteriorating. Most suburban areas had negative values, indicating a lack of leisure and entertainment facilities, a low frequency of social interaction, and poor social security. However, social relations in Minhang, Jiading, Jinshan, and Chongming were developing positively (Fig. 6 (e)).  4.3 Impact mechanism of ESs on resident well-being According to our collinearity diagnosis results, the VIF in supporting services, regulating services, provisioning services, and RWB are all <10.0. The SEM results are reliable because the CMIN/DF is <2.0 (1.49), GFI is 0.853, CFI and NFI are >0.9 (0.976 and 0.968), NNFI is 0.942, and RMSEA is 0.096. As shown in Fig. 7  , the supporting services contributed directly to regulating services and cultural services but suppressed the provisioning services, negating H1. Ecosystem regulation services significantly inhibited cultural services while significantly promoting the provisioning services; The cultural services significantly inhibited the regulating and provisioning services; The provisioning services significantly promoted cultural services while significantly suppressing regulating services, validating H2. Regulating services and cultural services directly improved RWB, while provisioning services reduced RWB, validating H3. Supporting services indirectly promoted the RWB by promoting regulating and cultural services, while reducing the negative impact of provisioning services on RWB by suppressing them, validating H4. From the perspective of impact intensity, supporting services had a stronger promoting effect on regulating services, regulating services had a stronger promoting effect on provisioning services, and provisioning services had a stronger promoting effect on cultural services. Compared with cultural services, regulating services had a stronger promoting effect on RWB, while provisioning services had a stronger inhibitory effect on RWB. The material satisfacrion, spiritual fulfillment, health, security and social relationships effectively measured the RWB. Generally, the habitat quality of forests, grasslands, and wetlands is higher, while the habitat quality of cultivated land is lower. Meanwhile, forests, grasslands, and wetlands can provide more carbon sequestration and leisure and entertainment venues, so supporting services had a promoting effect on regulating and cultural services. The improvement of habitat quality may occur in the case of returning farmland to forests, therefore, supporting services had a negative impact on the provisioning services. The cultivated land in Shanghai was mainly located in the suburbs, providing leisure and entertainment functions, thus promoting cultural services. While the cultivated land generally occupied forest and grassland, which had an inhibitory effect on regulating services. Scenic spots and parks that provided cultural services increased their impermeable area and reduce the regulating and provisioning services. The suburbs of Shanghai were the main production areas for food supply, and the RWB in these areas was relatively low compared to central cities, so the provisioning services had an inhibitory effect on RWB.   5 Discussion 5.1 Underlying driving factors of the impact mechanism Supplies related to habitat quality, carbon storage, food production, and cultural ecosystem services have declined over the last twenty years in Shanghai. The spatial pattern showed a trend of radiating degradation from the city center to the surrounding areas; the supply of ESs was higher in the suburbs than in the core urban areas. Previous studies have reached similar conclusions (Jiang, 2019 ; Yang et al., 2022 ; Wu, 2017 ; Chen et al., 2022 ). The rapid development of downtown Shanghai encroached on natural areas, thus reducing the availability of ESs, the case study of the Wuhan metropolitan area also had similar results (Yu et al., 2023 ). The changes in cultural services in Shanghai from 2000 to 2010 were not significant, while the losses in cultural services were severe from 2010 to 2020. Although there had a significant increase in scenic spots and parks from 2000 to 2020, the significant reduction in green space led to a loss of cultural services. The sharp increase in parks, city squares, and scenic spots in the central urban area slowed down their losses, and a moderate increase in landscape diversity met the cultural needs of residents. But the proportion of impermeable areas in scenic spots, city squares, and parks was relatively large, there was a significant increase in the types of cultural landscapes, and the green space area was relatively fragmented, so the total supply of cultural services was relatively low. Supporting services had a significant positive impact on regulating services and cultural services (Fig. 7 ). The forest land and grassland area accounted for 2.11% in Shanghai was smaller in 2020 than in previous years, while cultivated land accounted for 37.7%. Forests and grasslands have higher net primary productivity (NPP), vegetation cover, and more biological diversity than urban areas, thus, they contribute more to habitat quality. However, due to the strict cultivated land protection system, more forest and grassland areas have been converted to cultivated land, reducing supporting services and increasing food production. Accordingly, supporting services exerted a negative impact on provisioning services. Cultivated land, which had a lower potential for biodiversity than forest and grassland, was the primary source of supporting services, regulating services, and cultural service delivery in Shanghai, resulting in a low supply of total ESs. Nevertheless, cultivated land had higher carbon density and carbon sequestration capacity than construction land, promoting carbon sequestration. Countryside parks combined food production, recreation, culture, and education so that supply, cultural, and regulating services reinforce each other in those areas. The source of cultivated land was generally highâcarbon-density forest land and grassland, therefore, provisioning services suppresses regulating services. Cultural services came from urban squares, parks, natural landscapes, and cultural landscapes. However, the landscape pattern of combining ecological and built-up landscapes had resulted in the reduction of large areas of continuous natural landscapes, weakening the carbon sequestration capacity, so cultural services, and regulating services inhibited each other's effects. RWB in Shanghai appeared to improve from 2000 to 2020. High values for the four dimensions of well-being were concentrated in the central urban area, whereas relatively low values occurred in the suburbs. Although we acknowledge the existence of âurban diseasesâ such as overcrowding, insufficient resources, and ecological pollution in cities (Deng and Guo, 2018 ; Chen et al., 2016 ), it has been shown that common mental syndromes report higher prevalence in cities, rural areas are more suitable for cultivating one's body and mind (Ventriglio et al., 2021 ). Our results also proved that the complete public service facilities, educational resources, convenient transportation, and active market economy in cities were more conducive to improving multidimensional RWB, and accessibility and related positive experiential outcomes needed to be improved in suburban contexts, which supported the existing research (KyttÃ¤ et al., 2016 ). Provisioning services had a negative impact on RWB, while cultural and regulating services had a positive impact. We attribute this to the uneven distribution of farmland and population in Shanghai. Up to 92.09% of the cultivated land and 87.09% of the garden land were located in Chongming, Pudong New Area, Jinshan, Fengxian, Qingpu, and Songjiang, while the population in the suburb accounts for only 46.5% of the total population. Other studies had shown that rural farmers' disposable income depends on food production, which had a significant impact on their well-being and can promote SDGs 1.1 (Ciftcioglu, 2017 ; Haile et al., 2021 ). However, from 2000 to 2020, the decrease in grain production and the increase in per capita income in the suburbs of Shanghai indicated that the income sources of farmers were more diversified. In addition to meeting material needs, residents in metropolitan areas had higher demands for culture, education, leisure, entertainment, and health and safety, which will promote urban construction and development and damage the natural ecological environment. We found a substantial spatial mismatch between the supply and demand of ESs in Shanghai, which affected the RWB. The finding was also supported by research on the relationship between urban expansion and ecosystem supply and demand (Zeng et al., 2023 ; Zhou et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the degree of achievement of SDGs between central urban areas and suburban. The conflict between ESs and the RWB remained an important challenge for urban sustainable development. What we need to focus on is how to revitalize the neglected rural economy and culture, and use the rich spatial resources of it to attract the inflow of urban capital, labor, and technology, which in turn creates wealth. Revitalize natural resources to serve urban and rural residents and narrow the RWB gap between the urban and rural areas. The primary development of the land was the key factor contributing to the process by which conventional cultural ecosystem services deteriorated during urbanization, while spatial planning and design facilitated the reconstruction of cultural ecosystem services across larger core areas (Wang et al., 2021 ). For the downtown areas, it should be improved biodiversity through spatial planning and ecological restoration, design more educational and cultural, recreational, and entertainment areas with the natural environment as the background, promoting the urban residents to contact with natural ecosystems, then bringing them happiness. The regulating services in arid or rural areas have been shown to contribute to RWB, albeit less intensely (Qiu et al., 2022 ), for agriculture and daily life can provide farmers with regulatory and cultural services. With decreasing food production and increasing population in Shanghai from 2000 to 2020, the food self-sufficiency rate in Shanghai was only 15% in 2019, and the food supply gap was expanding, resulting in a negative correlation between local food supply and RWB. Food supply plays a key role in improving the RWB, as food provides material nutrients and energy to maintain the lives and health of residents. It is necessary to pay attention to the positive effect of food on the RWB, strictly control the reduction and rate of arable land and the rate of population growth, rely on scientific and technological inputs to increase yields, improve the market price system for food purchases, and guarantee the food supply to Shanghai residents. In addition, the multi-functional landscape of cultivated land in the suburbs also provides residents with opportunities for leisure.  5.2 Implications for ecosystem restoration and governance More resources were concentrated in the central urban area, resulting in higher levels of material satisfaction, safety, health, and social well-being than in the suburbs. To promote sustainable development between urban and rural areas, it is necessary to promote the mutual circulation of human resources, technology, capital, and natural resource elements between urban and rural areas, and narrow the urban-rural gap. The overall RWB of Putuo was relatively low, the spiritual satisfaction, safety, and health decreased in Jing'an, while material satisfaction and social relationships increased. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the development direction of the above two districts. Access to green spaces improved urban residents' physical and mental health, particularly during unstable periods such as epidemics (Kong et al., 2022 ). In the future, Shanghai's urban area should pay attention to growing ecological resources, such as grassland and forest land in the urban center and its surrounding areas, to improve habitat quality, carbon storage services, and cultural services. Scientific environmental protection policies must be implemented, such as science-based delineation of ecological red lines, implementing ecological compensation measures, rationally allocating ecological and non-ecological land, and developing environmental protection and social economy in a balanced manner to satisfy SDGs. In the suburbs, spiritual fulfillment was relatively strong in Jinshan, Jiading, and Fengxian, where forest land and cultivated land provided abundant cultural ecosystem services. However, material satisfaction, health, safety, and social relations were poor in the suburbs. RWB in Minhang, Jiading, and Jinshan, was stronger than in other districts since they had a favorable ecological environment and a relatively high level of social security and economic development. Appropriate eco-tourism development should be implemented in the outer suburbs, where ecological resources can be transformed into ecological products. Agricultural development should be revitalized through the integration of industries to improve residents' income and quality of life. It is also necessary to upgrade and transform traditional agricultural enterprises into leisure services to enhance public infrastructure development, commercial growth, and social security. Coordinated development of the ecological environment with RWB is a very challenging, long-term goal. Over the past decade, Shanghai had grappled with many aspects of its sustainable development. Shanghai implemented various policies from 2010 to 2020, including the establishment of a platform for land consolidation with local government as the core, as well as classic policy tools, like ecological spatial planning and the elimination of unproductive building land (Zhou et al., 2022 ). These measures reduced the expansion of construction and agricultural facility lands and slowed down ecosystem damage to cultivated land, forest land, and grassland due to urban expansion. Rural parks based on NbS promoted the coordination of ecological protection and economic development. Developing parks and other public green spaces in rural areas can increase farmers' income and supply ecological products for urban residents. This is also a critical period of transition for the city of Shanghai, it is essential to achieve sustainable RWB by optimizing the ecological compensation systems and market trading mechanisms, as well as continuously enhancing the cultural and tourism infrastructure of national parks in the future.  5.3 Innovations and limitations We developed a new framework to explore the impact mechanism of ESs on RWB in the context of SDGs. The proposed framework reveals which RWB set in the SDGs is related to ESs and facilitates the analysis of the impact mechanism between different ESs and their effects on RWB. Critical ESs affecting RWB were identified by clarifying the causal relationship between ESs and RWB in metropolitan areas. The results may inform a multi-objective, collaborative environmental management strategy to promote the multidimensional well-being of residents in metropolitan areas. However, this study has limitations and uncertainties that merit further improvement. First, the panel data we used to assess RWB may not have included notable differences within districts; thus, it may be helpful to integrate panel data and geospatial data. Second, due to limited statistical data, we only assessed the objective well-being of residents at the macro scale, although ESs also have a significant impact on micro-level subjective well-being, such as positive or negative emotions. In the future, we plan to investigate the effect of ESs on the subjective well-being of residents using questionnaires and interviews.   6 Conclusion We developed a novel framework to explore the impact mechanism of ESs on RWB in the context of SDGs. We found that habitat quality, carbon storage capacity, food supply capacity, and cultural services in Shanghai declined from 2000 to 2020. There was a significant difference in the total value and trend of RWB between the central urban and suburban areas of Shanghai. The SEM results indicated that supporting services enhanced regulating and cultural services directly while inhibiting provisioning services. Cultural services had a negative impact on regulating services and provisioning services. Regulating services promoted provisioning services and suppressed cultural services while provisioning services promoted cultural services greatly and suppressed regulating services. Regulating and cultural services directly promoted the RWB, while provisioning services had an inhibitory effect on it. Supporting services impacted RWB by influencing provisioning, regulating, and cultural services. Supporting services were crucial to the improvement of other ESs. Shanghai still faces the arduous task of promoting the harmonious development of humans and nature. The coordinated improvement of the ecological environment and RWB requires the collaborative engagement of governments and society to achieve the SDGs. We argue that public parks should be constructed to enhance the variety, stability, and sustainability of the ecosystem in downtown areas, allowing the ecological environment to be restored and managed appropriately in the future. Cultural and tourism infrastructures of parks in outer suburbs can be improved as well, including the provision of additional service posts and high-quality cultural services. Further optimizing the ecological compensation mechanism and market trading mechanism would also shorten the transition period of the ecological economy and may be the key to promoting the overall RWB in Shanghai.
