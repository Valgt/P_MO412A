                  Biodiversity is an important indicator to evaluate the sustainable development of human society. To protect the biodiversity on earth, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set precise requirements. Biodiversity protection and development are closely linked, and its goal is to protect biodiversity in a way that does not destroy essential habitats and ecosystems. China is one of the countries with the wealthiest biodiversity globally, and it is also one of the countries with the most severe threats to biodiversity. This research analyzes the characteristics of China's biodiversity and the threats it faces, and the biodiversity conservation work that China needs to carry out, and pointed out that in the context of COP15 and climate change, the rational development and continuous use of biological resources is an urgent matter related to the sustainable development of humankind. This research synthesizes the most advanced progress on biodiversity in recent decades. Further, we selected more than 20 indicators related to biodiversity and analyzed the current biodiversity situation in China by using spatial panel measurement and clustering methods. The results show that: 1) coastal provinces in China have more invasive species than inland provinces, and the number of invasive species in inland areas decreased with the distance from the seaside; 2) urbanization, including population crowding and land development, have a noticeable negative impact on biodiversity, with the values of −0.09 and −0.46, respectively; 3) The influence coefficients of temperature and precipitation on biodiversity are both significantly positive. Suitable temperature and abundant rainfall are conducive to biodiversity improvement. Based on these results, three policy directions for protecting biodiversity in China or globally were proposed.

Further, we selected more than 20 indicators related to biodiversity and analyzed the current biodiversity situation in China by using spatial panel measurement and clustering methods. The results show that: 1) coastal provinces in China have more invasive species than inland provinces, and the number of invasive species in inland areas decreased with the distance from the seaside; 2) urbanization, including population crowding and land development, have a noticeable negative impact on biodiversity, with the values of −0.09 and −0.46, respectively; 3) The influence coefficients of temperature and precipitation on biodiversity are both significantly positive. Suitable temperature and abundant rainfall are conducive to biodiversity improvement. Based on these results, three policy directions for protecting biodiversity in China or globally were proposed.

Considering the Kunming Declaration of the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in October 2021 has called for "urgent and integrated action" to reflect biodiversity considerations, the final implementation of biodiversity conservation has become an essential concern to the world. At the same time, biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, and climate change are also hotspots of international concern. At present, when CBD sets new goals, it mainly focuses on unilateral content, such as ecosystems, species, genetic diversity, and the benefits that nature brings to humankind. However, there is still a lack of a unified, integrated, and comprehensive perspective to link several aspects of content and how to link them. The interdependence of the four elements of ecosystems, species, genetic diversity, and the benefits that nature brings to humankind provides an excellent opportunity to plan current and future policies and actions to coordinate and interact (Díaz et al., 2020 ). In a wide range of biological groups and ecosystems, biomass increases with increasing species richness. After controlling for environmental covariates, the increase in biodiversity and biomass is more substantial than recorded in previous experiments and is comparable or more comparable to the impact of other well-known productivity drivers, including climate and nutrient availability (Duffy et al., 2017 ). China has a large land area and abundant biological species, but the pressure of biodiversity conservation is enormous. Therefore, China further proposed biodiversity monitoring and investigation and improved biodiversity. Many measures such as protecting the network, implementing adequate biodiversity protection, and strengthening the management and control of alien species have provided substantial political support for biodiversity protection. In September 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit formally adopted the "2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development" and established the Global SDGs. This programmatic document, which initially included 17 sustainable development goals and 169 specific goals, covered the three significant areas of society, economy, and environment, and put forward precise biodiversity requirements. The alignment of the Biodiversity Targets and the SDGs can create synergies between the two global governance systems. Among the SDGs, items 14 and 15 have the highest relevance to biodiversity. They are the sustainable use of marine and aquatic resources and terrestrial ecosystems (including forest management, combating desertification, curbing land degradation, etc.). Connecting with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals will help advance biodiversity governance and strengthen the synergy between biodiversity governance and other environmental governance issues. Issues such as climate change, combating desertification, species protection, and public health are listed under different international institutional frameworks, but they are all closely related to biodiversity governance. For example, sustainable development can coordinate and manage forest carbon sinks, zoonotic diseases, and sanitation activities involving biodiversity governance. For instance, the just concluded COP26 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) maintained the hope of achieving the 1.5 °C targets for temperature rise control. At the level of consciousness, COP26 once again emphasized the extreme urgency of strengthening the global response to climate emergencies and the need for a fair and equitable climate transition in the world. The achievements of COP26 include the signing of the "Glasgow Climate Convention" and the climate action initiated at the same time during COP26. The "Glasgow Climate Convention" main points include the first commitment to reduce the use of fossil fuels, increase the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) of the contracting states, and establish a global carbon market mechanism, and support green debt and funding. The "Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use" signed by more than 100 national leaders was the first important agreement reached during COP26. This declaration promised to stop deforestation and reverse the trend of land degradation by 2030 and received 14 billion euros (approximately 19.2 billion U.S. dollars) of public and private funds to protect and restore forests. Responding to climate change and biodiversity protection are complementary. Climate change is becoming an increasingly severe driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation-and this loss has the potential to exacerbate climate change. Forests are still being cut down, destroying biodiversity and threatening climate goals. Effective responses to climate change can slow down global warming and reduce the risk of ecosystem degradation and species extinction caused by extreme weather and natural disasters. Strengthening the protection and restoration of the ecosystem, curbing the loss of biodiversity, improving the quality and stability of the ecosystem, stopping and reversing deforestation can also enhance the role of carbon sinks, slow climate change, and improve the ability to respond to climate change. China has a complex terrain, diverse climate, unique terrestrial and marine ecosystems, rich species resources, and genetic diversity. China is one of the countries with the richest biodiversity in the world. It has a deep understanding of biodiversity and shares China's experiences and lessons in protecting biodiversity, responding to climate crises, and managing natural resources. As one of the first countries to sign and ratify the Convention on Biological Diversity, China has always been a firm supporter and contributor to the global biodiversity agenda. On October 8, 2021, China released the first white paper on biodiversity conservation, "China's Biodiversity Conservation” and announced that biodiversity conservation had become a national strategy. On October 12, 2021, President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at COP15. He announced that China would continue to encourage the construction of ecological civilization. The idea of ecological civilization was essentially consistent with the three primary goals of the CBD, protection, sustainable use, and benefit-sharing, and the SDGs, so it was selected as the theme of the COP15. On October 19, 2021, China issued the "Opinions on Further Strengthening the Protection of Biodiversity" to deploy further biodiversity protection related work.  2 Method 2.1 Literature review The formation of the concept of biodiversity is a gradual and complex process. Biodiversity was first proposed by Fisher and Williams in 1943, specifically referring to the attributes of communities (S. Peng, 1987 ). The US Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) gave a more precise definition in 1987: the diversification and variability of living organisms and the ecological complexes on which they depend (Z. Liu et al., 2010 ). In 1995, the "Global Biodiversity Assessment" published by the United Nations Environment Program believed that biodiversity is the general term for all biological species, genetic variation within species, and the ecosystem they constitute with the living environment (X. Ming, 1999 ). Biodiversity is the sum of organisms. Their ecological complexes with the environment and various environmental processes related to them, including millions of animals, plants, microorganisms, and they are the main research areas of the genes they possess (W. Fang, 1995 ). The complex ecosystems formed by their living environment include genetic diversity, species diversity, ecosystem diversity, and landscape diversity—biodiversity results from the 4-billion-years co-evolution of the earth's organisms and the environment. Through material circulation, energy flow, and information exchange, organisms and the environment have formed a relatively stable open system that maintains the ecosystem humans depend on. The loss of any species or part of a species will lead to a series of adverse chain reactions. 2.1.1 Genetic diversity Genetic diversity, also known as genetic diversity, refers to the assortment of genetic factors and their combinations that determine biological characteristics (Morgera and Tsioumani, 2010 ). Genetic variation is the prerequisite for species, populations, and ecosystems and the basis for speciation and natural evolution—genetic diversity results from chromosomal aberrations, gene mutations, and gene recombination. Changes (or mutations) in genetic material are the root cause of genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is not only expressed at the level of DNA, mRNA, polysaccharides, fats, proteins, and other molecules, but also at all levels of life, including organelles, cells, tissues, organs, individuals, populations, communities, and ecosystems, landscape, etc.; and in many aspects such as structure, form, behavior, physiology, and function (K. Wang., L. Li., 2019). The protection of genetic diversity is a necessary condition for the conservation of biodiversity (Zhang and Jiang, 1997 ). Take the critical forest ecosystem as an example. If the forest is destroyed and cannot be renewed typically, it may cause severe genetic loss. When many artificial forests replace natural vegetation, the number of species or the number of individual populations in a specific area may decrease and even cause inbreeding and gene drift, which will lead to a more severe reduction or loss of genetic diversity (K. Wang., L. Li., 2019; W. Ye, 2000 ). Artificial breeding will eliminate most of the original populations, and the genetic basis of natural vegetation is often restricted to a very narrow range, which will lead to the loss of beneficial genes, reducing the adaptability of production populations and shrinking the genetic basis. The risk of gene singularity has a painful lesson in agriculture and forestry production. Only the rich genetic diversity can enable the population to withstand the various challenges of its survival. The richer the genetic diversity or variability within a species, the greater its adaptability to environmental changes and the greater its evolutionary potential (Wang and Ge, 2009 ).  2.1.2 Species diversity Species are the basic unit and core of taxonomic research and the basis and premise of species diversity research. Biological species are not directly composed of individuals. Still, individuals from populations according to specific rules in a particular time and space, and then different populations form species regularly (K. Wang., L. Li., 2019; H. Qian et al., 2018 ). Species have similar morphological characteristics and show certain biological features (ecology, physiology, biochemistry, etc.) and occupy a specific distribution area in nature. Individuals of the same species mate with each other to produce genetically similar offspring, while different species usually have fecundity isolation or hybrid sterility. Species diversity includes two aspects: (1) refers to the species richness, which can be called regional diversity (2). It refers to the uniformity of species distribution in ecology, called ecological diversity or community species diversity (W. Ru. et al., 2000). The modes and principles of species biodiversity are changeable. For example, it is difficult for each model to be fully resolved by one mechanism; on different spatial scales, the observed models may also be different; regional processes may affect the final local model (Gaston, 2000 ). Human disturbance to species includes logging, reclamation, and infrastructure construction, leading to the fragmentation of wildlife habitat and affecting species' survival. Whether animals' eating habits and habitat needs are specific is a factor that may lead to endangered species. In general, species with particular dietary habits and habitats are more likely to become extinct. Human social needs for wild animals and plants, such as collection, may also lead to the development pressure of wild animals and plants and endanger species' survival. China's terrestrial vertebrates are listed in 5 species, 30 species at the functional extinction level, 343 at the endangered level, 459 at the stressed level, 439 at the concern level, and 1032 at the stressed level non-endangered status (Jiang and Luo., 2012 .).  2.1.3 Ecosystem diversity Ecosystem diversity refers to the variety of habitat types, biological communities, and ecological processes. The diversity of habitat types relates mainly to inorganic environments such as topography, landforms, climate, and hydrology. The variety of biological communities refers to the diversity of community composition, structure, and function; ecological process refers to the design of ecosystems in time. The changes in form and function in space mainly include species flow, energy flow, material circulation, competition between organisms, predation, parasitism, etc. An ecosystem is an ecological unit that combines organisms (including individuals, populations, and organisms)., Through energy flow and material circulation, non-living things (including sunlight, air, water, minerals, and nutrients) are within a particular space. Any natural body composed of a biological community and its environment can be called an ecosystem (Y. Song et al., 2014 ; Sneddon, 2000 ; K. Ma, 1999 ). Due to humans' destruction of natural resources, changes in habitat and climate, and the spread of pathogens, exotic and domestic animals, and plants, the diversity of ecosystems worldwide is rapidly declining. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that biodiversity loss can significantly change the biogeochemical and dynamic properties of ecosystems (Naeem et al., 2012 ). Issues (such as food, water, energy, and biosecurity) are still at the forefront of the world. The question before us is whether these advancements will enable us to transform from merely invoking the precautionary principle of protecting biodiversity to a predictable science that provides practical and concrete solutions for mitigating and adapting to the consequences of biodiversity loss. The continuous destruction of ecosystems by human activities has become a global environmental problem. The collapse of the ecological environment may manifest as forest reduction, grassland degradation, land desertification, soil erosion, water quality deterioration, lake area reduction, coastal water quality deterioration, frequent red tides, sharp declines in economic resources, and intensification of natural disasters. The destruction of the ecological environment has caused severe loss and degradation of the diversity of various ecosystems such as forests, grasslands, farmlands, and waters. The rapid population growth is the main reason for destroying and changing wildlife habitats and over-using biological resources (Rands et al., 2010 ). The destruction and fragmentation of habitat have become the most crucial reason for decreasing mammals and habitat areas (Feng et al., 2019 ). Increasing ecological changes have brought multiple pressures to biodiversity protection, and the topography, climate, population, economic development level, and external pressure sources of different provinces are different. Biological species cause other impacts, and the pressure of declining biodiversity is urgently curbed (Lu et al., 2020 ). It can be seen from the literature that humanity's understanding of nature and the relationship between man and nature is a process of gradual development and deepening. For example, CBD proposes to organically combine the adequate protection of natural resources with the rational use of resources, which is an update and correction of the former absolute protectionist concept. Later in nature protection, people gradually realized that in nature, there is an inseparable connection between various species and between organisms and the surrounding environment. If nature protection only focuses on protecting the species itself, it cannot effectively implement the purpose of nature protection. To save rare and endangered species, we must focus on protecting the wild populations of the species involved and protect their habitats. Adequate protection of the entire ecosystem where the species are located is required. Due to the long-term biodiversity awareness, the lack of natural protection has minimal effects. The world's biodiversity has been severely reduced, directly threatening the natural environment humankind depends on for survival and development. It is in this context that the concept of biodiversity continues to evolve. In the "Kunming Declaration," it was determined that "the core of government policy formulation is that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity has become 'mainstreamed' and incorporated into national policies or decision-making."   2.2 Development of biodiversity conservation and SDGs The increasing extinction of species, reducing genetic diversity, and the large-scale destruction of ecosystems have attracted the international community's attention. The direct causes of the loss of biodiversity are mainly the loss and destruction of habitat, the invasion of alien species, the overexploitation of biological resources, environmental pollution, global climate change, industrialized agriculture, and forestry, etc. The fundamental driving force lies in the rapid growth of population and natural resources, the continuous reduction of the trade scope of agriculture, forestry, and fishery, the unreasonable assessment of the value of the environment and its resources, the unbalanced distribution of benefits arising from the use and protection of biological resources, and the inconsistency of the legal system (Wood et al., 2013 ). In short, human activities are the root cause of changes in biodiversity. China is one of the countries with vibrant biodiversity and the most threatened. Due to the rapid economic development and colossal population pressure in recent years, the ecological environment and biodiversity face severe threats; especially the product of predatory resources has caused environmental degradation and species loss in many areas of China (Lu et al., 2020 ). Protecting biodiversity, restoring the ecological environment, and rational and practical natural resources have become urgent and arduous challenges China faces. The SDGs are essential in sustainable development. They are global goals that integrate economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability and strengthen the relationship between the worldwide biodiversity framework and SDGs. Consistency is the basic consensus of the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (Hoban et al., 2020 ). Especially from 2017 to 2018, the 21st and 22nd meetings of the Scientific Advisory Subsidiary Body of the Convention on Biological Diversity focused on examining the relationship between the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and SDGs. From the perspective of the setting of SDGs, SDG15 (protecting terrestrial ecosystems and curbing the loss of biodiversity), SDG14 (protecting underwater organisms), SDG2 (sustainable agriculture), and SDG13 (response to climate change) are all related to biodiversity. Protection is inseparable. China has formulated the "China's National Plan for Implementing the 2030 Agenda" and has carried out specific practices such as the innovation demonstration zone of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As the host country of COP15, China will discuss how to integrate biodiversity and SDGs goals smoothly and explores synchronous realization of biodiversity goals and SDGs. The lack of monitoring of biodiversity is the biggest weakness of SDGs. Although SDGs have a comprehensive list of indicators supporting natural resources, they lack assessment and comprehensive monitoring of ecosystems and biodiversity, so that these deficiencies threaten the entire SDG agenda (Dickens et al., 2020 ). Even though most countries are moving towards environmentally sustainable development goals, this has little to do with the actual biodiversity protection but rather represents socio-economic development. If this situation continues, SDGs may become a smokescreen that further destroys biodiversity next decade (Y. Zeng. et al., 2020 ).  2.3 Methodology 2.3.1 Panel analysis Economic and social activities and natural factors are closely related to biodiversity. This section constructs a quantitative model that includes the two-way fixed effects of individuals and time for analysis. Furthermore, the specific form is as follows:(1) Y i t   = α + β X i t   + μ i  + η t  + ε i t        In the above formula, Y is the explained variable, representing the nature reserve area in each province. The better the biodiversity protection in a region, the larger the nature reserve. X is a series of explanatory variables, including population (pop), urban built-up area (ua), regional economic development level (gdp), environmental protection investment (ei), average temperature (at), and average precipitation (ap). The population index characterizes population urbanization, measured by the actual urban population at the end of the year. The area of metropolitan built-up area depicts the degree of land urbanization. The above two indicators together reflect the urbanization factors that affect biodiversity. The level of economic development is measured by regional GDP and adjusted to the constant price in 2003. Environmental protection investment is measured by investment in urban environmental infrastructure construction. The average temperature and precipitation are taken from the daily average monitoring data of the capital cities of each province and averaged together to obtain the annual average data. The above economic data comes from the "Statistical Yearbook of China's Regional Economic" and the statistical yearbooks of various provinces. The meteorological data comes from the China Meteorological Data Network. Due to data availability, the time scale is selected as the research sample for the relevant data of 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2003 to 2017 (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Tibet Autonomous Region). This paper has done logarithmic first-order difference processing for each economic indicator variable and we use geometric means to substitute some non-serious missing data.  2.3.2 Cluster analysis In addition, we selected 30 biodiversity-related provincial indicators covering climate, geography, biology, and society from the "Regional Statistical Yearbook" and "Environmental Statistical Yearbook," using Stata 16 software to adopt the European distance and the most prolonged distance method. Perform cluster analysis, clustering using K-medians method, given D = { x 1  , x 2  , … , x m   }    ，supposing C = { C 1  , C 2  , … , C k   }    ，and minimizing the error:(2) d i s t e d    ( x i  , x j   )  = | x i  − x j  | 2  = ∑  u = 1  n  | x i u   − x j u    |  2        (3) E = ∑  i = 1  k  ∑  x ∈ C i    | x − μ i  | 2 2      where μ i     is the median vector of cluster  C i    .    3 Results and discussion 3.1 Quantification of the effect of different influencing factors Considering that the panel data set has a relatively small number of variables (See Table 1  ) and a long-time sequence, also because the large T contains more information and has intra-group solid autocorrelation (see Table 2  ), it is necessary to consider heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of error terms, so we use the long panel estimation strategy. For possible fixed effects, we added individual dummy variables. For time effects, we added a time trend term for control (due to the long T, if time dummy variables are added, more degrees of freedom may be lost). The additive interaction between individuals and time is not statistically significant (See Table 3  ), i.e., it cannot reject parallel lines on a probability scale, so it is appropriate to use the two-way linear fixed effects regression. We used Panel-Corrected Standard Error (PCSE) to estimate the long panel. In Table 1  (1), to consider the time effect, we generate the time trend variable t (year minus 2002) and then use the Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV) method to estimate. In Table 1  (2), further considering the possible inter-group heteroscedasticity and inter-group synchronization correlation, we used PCSE for estimation. Table 1  (3) assuming that the disturbance term obeys the AR (1) process, and there is intra-group autocorrelation, but the autoregressive coefficients of each group are required to be the same. In Table 1  (4), we allow the existence of intra-group autocorrelation with different autoregressive coefficients in each group. Considering that Table 1  (4) conditions are the most relaxed, we mainly consider the coefficients of Table 1  (4). Table 1  shows the regression results of the analysis of factors affecting biodiversity. According to the regression results in column (4) in Table 1 , the coefficient of population is not significantly, and urban built-up area on the natural reserves of the region is positive, mirroring the optimization and adjustment of the scope and functional zoning of the nature reserve in the land and space planning and the local government's financial support to the nature reserve. The regional economic development level has a positive effect on the protection of biodiversity. The elasticity coefficient is 0.114, indicating that as a region's financial status becomes more developed, people will pay more attention to higher-level life needs and become more aware of environmental protection and ecology—the importance of the system's integrity to increase the conservation of biodiversity. The impact coefficient of ecological protection investment is positive but not significant, indicating that The efficiency of government investment in environmental protection should be improved, and appropriate participation by the public and NGOs can be considered. The influence coefficients of the temperature is significantly positive. This is closely related to China's geographical location and climatic periods. Suitable temperature with appropriate rains provides good conditions conducive to increasing biodiversity. The clustering results (Fig. 1  ) show that China's regional distribution of biodiversity can be roughly divided into six categories: 1) Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang. These provinces either have a colder climate or are widely distributed in deserts, and the conditions for biological reproduction are the worst. 2) Shanxi, Liaoning, Ningxia, etc., these provinces or destructive human activities are strong, the geographical climate is not suitable for biological reproduction, and the biodiversity is not optimistic. 3) Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, etc. These provinces have better climatic conditions than those mentioned above, but the density of human development activities is relatively strong, and the biodiversity is medium. 4) Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin are municipalities directly under the Central Government. Although human activities have a wide range of impacts, the economy and society have developed higher. Urban residents have a strong awareness of ecological and environmental protection, and urban organisms dominate biodiversity. 5) Fujian, Chongqing, Guizhou, and Hainan. These provinces have ideal climates and complex geomorphology, suitable for the growth of different organisms, but still, have a certain degree of development intensity, so the biodiversity is weaker than the two provinces mentioned later. 6) Yunnan and Sichuan. The two provinces are rich in water and heat conditions, have a significant vertical drop in mountains, many niches, and have the strongest biodiversity.  3.2 Invasive alien species in China Invasive alien species are introduced from outside the distribution area, forming self-renewing ability under local natural or artificial conditions, and causing apparent damage or impact to the local ecosystem or geographical structure. Invasive alien species usually have the characteristics of a wide range of ecological adaptation, rapid growth and development, and vital fecundity (Sang et al., 2006 ). Thus, they have greater environmental tolerance and higher co-evolution potential. They will destroy the spread of diseases, competition, predation, or hybridization with local species, thereby destroying the symbiotic relationship of primitive species in the ecosystem and causing great harm to local species and ecosystems (X. Li et al., 1999; X. Yang., 2009 ). Therefore, the study of alien species invasion and ecological impact, the mechanism of the species invasion process, the prediction, early warning, and management of exotic species are also the core scientific issues of biodiversity conservation. Vehicles, humans, and animals are the primary carriers of invasive alien species; seedling transportation, tourism, ballast water, engineering construction, and military transfer are important channels (K. Wang., L. Li., 2019 ; X. Li et al., 1999; X. Yang., 2009 ). Studies have shown that local populations' average (non-linear) size has decreased by 20% with the increase in the abundance of invasive species. The indicators of local communities have decreased by 25% on average, linearly (Bradley et al., 2019 ). High trophic invasive species cause severe (non-linear) loss of local populations and communities, and their impact is most substantial when their abundance is low. Invasive species with the exact trophic level cause (linear) loss of local populations and communities, but the impact of low-trophic invasive species is inconsistent. The number of invasive alien plants in China gradually decreases from south to north, and the species density gradually decreases from the southeast coast to the inland. The frost-free period is long, and there are many invasive alien plants in areas with sizeable annual rainfall. Traffic density is a critical factor in determining species density, and latitude determines the composition of species, which is consistent with the rules of invasive species in low-latitude regions (H. Xu, 2004 ; L. Chen, 2001 ). Invasive alien species seriously threaten the structure and function of the ecosystem, destroy the integrity of the ecosystem, accelerate the extinction of species, cause the loss of biodiversity, cause substantial economic losses, severely damage the ecological environment, and threaten human health (X. Wu. et al., 2006 ; J. Feng, 2008 ). For example, the invasion of farmland by alien species, forests, pastures, and waters reduces crops, forest and forage production, river blockage, and substantial economic losses. Human and livestock diseases caused by the invasion of alien species often cause significant financial losses (J. Feng et al., 2011 ). The disappearance and disappearance of the original plant community have changed the essential ecological characteristics of the community or ecosystem, such as the dominant species in the community, the physical aspects of the ecosystem, nutrient cycling, and plant productivity, reducing local or regional biodiversity (X. Wu. et al., 2006 ; Y. Zhu, 2012 ). As shown in Fig. 2   below, the distribution of invasive alien species and threatened species in China has similar distribution characteristics in space (the number of invasive species in each province comes from the data collected by Lu et al., 2020 ). The number of threatened species comes from D. Hui et al. (2011)  The number of invasive species in coastal provinces is generally more significant than that in inland provinces. The distribution of invasive species in inland areas is proportional to the area's average distance from the sea. On the one hand, it may be due to the higher risk of invasion of alien organisms in ports caused by the movement of ships in the process of maritime trade. On the other side, the habitats (precipitation, temperature, human activities, etc.) near the sea are suitable for expanding alien species (D. Hui et al., 2011 ), resulting in the overall decline of invasive species from the coast to the inland.  3.3 Climate change Adapting biodiversity to climate change is an essential part of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and a key issue in current and future biodiversity conservation. China is one of the countries with the richest biodiversity in the world. Climate change has changed the richness and diversity of species, leading to the extinction of certain species (D. Hui et al., 2011 ). In short, climate change has specific impacts on species distribution, migration, community structure, habitat quality, ecosystem, and landscape diversity. The vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change is manifested in the reduction of species distribution, fragmentation, and loss, the decline in abundance, diversity, populations, the infestation of pests, extinction of species, degradation or disappearance of habitats, shortage of water and food, and reduction of ecosystems and landscapes diversity and function decline (D. Hui et al., 2011 ). The most vulnerable ecosystems (Peng and Xiang. 1999 ) include coastal wetlands, mangroves, islands, tundra, alpine and mountain ecosystems, temperate cold temperate forests, tropical forests, marine coral reefs, and sea ice biota. The vulnerability of China's biodiversity to climate change mainly includes reduction of the distribution range of species (such as white-lipped deer and giant panda), fragmentation and loss of current habitats, reduction of species diversity and abundance, and expansion and damage of insect pests, which all increases the vulnerability and extinction rate of species (Sikai et al., 2013; Stein et al., 2013 ). Climate change may cause the sudden loss of biodiversity. This situation may happen within this century, and sooner than expected. Many ecosystems may not be slowly sliding down the slope of climate change but standing on the edge of a cliff. Controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and thus the rate of global warming, will undoubtedly reduce the number of high-risk species and buy more time for species and ecosystems to adapt to the changing climate. Species will have more time to find new habitats, change their behavior, or use human-led conservation efforts to gain a greater chance of survival (Sunday, 2020 ).  3.4 Urbanization and land-use transformation Urbanization is a complex and dynamic historical process. It includes the increase in the urban population and land use and brings about a series of economic, social, and ecological environmental problems. Some scholars believe that the reshaping of the urban spatial pattern by urbanization is one of the main driving forces that change the natural habitat, leading to the rapid decline and extinction of most local species (Edwards and Richardson, 2004 ). Some scholars believe that the urban space environment can determine the distribution and proportion of native species, which will lead to changes in species composition and species richness, and cause a series of problems, such as the decrease of native species diversity, the increase of alien species diversity and species homogeneity (X. He, 2017 ). In general, the main threats to urban biodiversity are rapid population growth and urban population influx; urban development causes the fragmentation of habitats; urban development causes severe environmental pollution; the impact of invasive species on urban biological species, etc. With the rapid growth of China's urbanization, the urban ecological environment has been seriously polluted, and the original natural habitats of the cities have been fragmented, which seriously threatens the sustainable development of Chinese cities. Urban biodiversity is the foundation of urban survival, and an urban ecosystem guarantees sustainable urban development. Urban biodiversity is a vital link connecting people and the natural environment and is significant to maintaining urban ecological safety and improving urban human settlements (Mao et al., 2013 ). Cities are generally considered poor in flora and fauna, but many urban vascular plants and small wildlife communities have a high species richness. Urban green spaces, parks, wetlands, botanical gardens, seed banks, gene banks, etc., are areas with rich biodiversity, and some cities are also essential transit habitats for migratory species. Although urban areas account for less than 3% of the earth's total surface, their location and spatial form significantly impact biodiversity (J. Feng et al., 2011 ; J. Li et al., 2005 ; Cilliers et al., 2010 ). The urban ecosystem problems caused by urbanization include high population density, high pollution and high interference, weak resistance to external natural disasters and internal interference (such as fires, traffic accidents, etc.), and poor self-recovery capabilities. It increases regional biological diversity vulnerability and the possibility of degradation (X. Gu., Y. Liu). In addition, the impact of urbanization on the habitats of surrounding areas cannot be ignored. Damage and degradation of natural ecosystems (such as habitat fragmentation) are the main reasons for the sharp decline in global biodiversity. But the issue that remains controversial is the extent to which fragmentation itself affects biodiversity. Indeed, habitat fragmentation reduces biodiversity by 13%–75%, reduces biomass, changes the original nutrient cycle, and damages essential ecosystem functions (Haddad et al., 2015 ). The areas with the smallest area and the strongest isolation are most affected by habitat fragmentation, and this effect will magnify over time. Therefore, there is an urgent need for adequate protection and restoration measures to improve landscape connectivity, thereby slowing down the rate of species extinction and helping to maintain ecosystem services.  3.5 Countermeasures to promote the implementation of biodiversity conservation goals 3.5.1 Establish an indicator monitoring system The Inter-agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators has developed a set of evaluation indicators to monitor the completion of the 2030 Agenda. In 2017, the evaluation system retained 232 indicators with a clear indicator concept. Only 93 goals for which evaluation methods and standards have been agreed upon, accounting for only 40% of all indicators, considering biodiversity indicator data methodology and statistical sources. The specific indicators are more difficult to measure than economic and social indicators. At present, the world and China still mainly choose the total afforestation area to evaluate SDG15 (J. Zhu et al., 2019 ). The indicators are relatively single. Based on the current remote sensing, thermal imaging, and big data, the use more methods to tap the value of biodiversity resources.  3.5.2 Explore various regional spatial management models Biodiversity protection must be incorporated into medium and long-term planning in various fields, incredibly territorial and spatial planning. Relevant spatial planning should integrate biodiversity protection goals and economic and social goals with implementation considerations and promote protecting nature reserves, forest parks, and biodiversity. The construction of protected spaces such as communities, urban green areas, and ecological corridors will promote biodiversity in the region.  3.5.3 Establish a dynamic data-sharing platform Establishing a biodiversity conservation supervision database and analytical models will provide data support for the country to formulate biodiversity conservation strategies and carry out conservation actions. So far, the Chinese biodiversity conservation supervision database has integrated various data resources of national biodiversity survey, observation, and evaluation projects and has constructed 2376 county-level administrative units across the country. The observation sample line is more than 34,000 km the species distribution record exceeds 5 million. The species distribution database has 3.5 TB, which is currently a relatively comprehensive and accurate wild animal and plant distribution database in China. However, the database has not yet been fully disclosed. Therefore, we call for establishing a dynamic data-sharing platform for biodiversity conservation and more public participation to broaden the basis for decision-making on multi-objective conservation goals.    4 Conclusion Biodiversity is an essential foundation for the survival and development of human beings. COP15 sends a clear signal to the world, major markets, and different economies to change the current development and economic growth methods. The "Kunming Declaration" promises to ensure the formulation, adoption, and implementation of a practical "Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework" to reverse the current trend of biodiversity loss and ensure that biodiversity is on the road to recovery by 2030, And then fully realize the 2050 vision of "harmonious coexistence between man and nature." Based on our empirical results, we suggest that China implement a series of ecological protection and restoration projects. Intending to restore degraded ecosystems, enhance ecosystem stability, and improve ecosystem quality, we have continued to carry out many environmental protection and restoration projects. Strictly prevent and control the invasion of alien species, strengthen the prevention and response to the invasion of alien species, and improve the prevention and control system of invasive alien species. Accelerate the transformation of economic development mode, advocate green and low-carbon life, and coordinate the promotion of high-level biodiversity conservation and high-quality development. Speed up establishing and improving a green and low-carbon circular development economic system, optimizing the industrial structure, and improving the efficiency of resource utilization and clean production. Organize the national biodiversity survey and establish and enhance the biodiversity monitoring and observation network. Promote the synergy of biodiversity-related conventions, and promote the joint role of the CBD and the UNFCCC. China has the dual identities of a developing country and a country of biodiversity. Of great significance to human survival and development, biodiversity is still lost at an alarming rate, and biodiversity conservation is imminent. Although human beings have done many works in the research and protection of biological diversity, which has achieved significant results, it is still negligible compared with the current situation of biological diversity degradation. The deterioration of biodiversity has not been fundamentally changed. Therefore, humankind must further raise awareness, strengthen cooperation, and realize the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature.
