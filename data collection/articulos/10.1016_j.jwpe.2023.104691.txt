                  Water is a fundamental natural resource for human life, socioeconomic development and environmental protection. However, population growth, climate change, and unsustainable water management practices are putting increasing pressure on water resources in many developing countries like Pakistan. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (UNSDG-6) aims to ensure the provision of clean water and sanitation for all, and the sustainable management of these resources. The primary objective of this article is to present the Government of Pakistan's perspective on accomplishing sustainable water management through the UN SDG-6 roadmap. It provides an in-depth review of Pakistan's water reserves and the associated challenges faced in effectively managing these resources. The report emphasizes improving water governance, water conservation enhancement, and equitable water distribution promotion to attain sustainable water management. The sustainable water management practices in Pakistan could be improved by identifying potential solutions, policy recommendations, community engagement, capacity building, and public awareness campaigns. Water management policies should incorporate climate change considerations, long-term planning, and efficient water pricing mechanisms that will improve sustainable water management in Pakistan and other developing countries.

Water is a fundamental natural resource for human life, socioeconomic development and environmental protection. However, population growth, climate change, and unsustainable water management practices are putting increasing pressure on water resources in many developing countries like Pakistan. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (UNSDG-6) aims to ensure the provision of clean water and sanitation for all, and the sustainable management of these resources. The primary objective of this article is to present the Government of Pakistan's perspective on accomplishing sustainable water management through the UN SDG-6 roadmap. It provides an in-depth review of Pakistan's water reserves and the associated challenges faced in effectively managing these resources. The report emphasizes improving water governance, water conservation enhancement, and equitable water distribution promotion to attain sustainable water management. The sustainable water management practices in Pakistan could be improved by identifying potential solutions, policy recommendations, community engagement, capacity building, and public awareness campaigns. Water management policies should incorporate climate change considerations, long-term planning, and efficient water pricing mechanisms that will improve sustainable water management in Pakistan and other developing countries.

The availability of safe and clean water is particularly limited in underdeveloped countries, causing significant health and economic challenges. Consequently, water scarcity remains a pressing global concern that requires ongoing attention and investment to ensure communities' well-being and prosperity [2 ]. Human activities, particularly industrial growth and the conversion of land into urban areas have far-reaching effects on water systems. Industrial development brings technological advances to cities and towns, while urbanization transforms rural land into urban regions with residential and commercial areas, transportation networks, and various infrastructure projects. These activities, including engineering projects like irrigation and reservoir construction, alter the natural landscape and expose water bodies to multiple stressors. In addition to increasing human access to water resources, it also introduces changes in land use, industrialization, urbanization, and geomorphological changes that impact the ecological and economic significance of water bodies [3 ,4 ]. 69 % of global water is primarily utilized for domestic purposes such as food preparation, drinking, and other household activities. This underscores the significance of water as a fundamental resource for human sustenance and welfare [5 ]. The creation of frameworks that can identify the primary threats to water security across multiple spatial scales, as well as the development of interventions such as treaties and scientific evaluations, is vital for preventing these threats. This will help safeguard marine life and the maintenance of sustainable water systems for delivery [6 ]. In the 21st century, a pressing issue emerges from the direct impact of climate change on water resources in Pakistan, leading to shifts in seasonal patterns, changes in natural regions, alterations in ecosystems, and adjustments in agro-ecological zones. While irrigation, accounting for 90 % of Pakistan's agricultural production, is of paramount importance. It is essential to recognize that agriculture as a whole continues to be a cornerstone of the country's economic growth. Nevertheless, these evolving challenges often divert attention from addressing the complexities associated with water-related issues [7 ,8 ]. In comparison to global averages, Pakistan's agricultural sector consumes a disproportionate amount of water (almost 95 %), indicating a serious imbalance of water allocation [9 ,10 ]. In future, urbanization, industrialization, population growth, and climate change will pose challenges to the agriculture industry and fresh-water resources [11 ,12 ]. Over 50 % of the population in developed nations is sustained by public water supplies; this includes the lowest-paid member of these societies [11 ]. To mitigate water-related challenges arising from escalated agricultural practices in Pakistan, it is necessary to reallocate water from the agricultural sector to alternative sectors. Pakistan is one of the countries around the world experiencing water stress, according to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, predicting that the country will experience a severe water scarcity within the next five years as a result of declining water supplies for infrastructure, manufacturing, and residents [13 ]. According to a World Bank estimate, Pakistan's per capita water decreased from 5000 cubic meters in 2000 to 1000 cubic meters in 2010 and was projected to drop to 800 cubic meters in 2020 [14 ]. As per the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator, a nation is considered to be experiencing “water stress” when its yearly per capita water allocation falls below the threshold of 1700 cubic meters. Noticeably, the scarcity of water occurs when annual per capita availability drops below 1000 cubic meters [15 ]. The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) from Yale University recently assessed the quality of drinking water worldwide to determine its safety [16 ]. They give each country a number based on how hazardous the water is for health. Countries with better scores had safer water. With an EPI score of 15.3, Pakistan is considered a “water stress country” because it faces challenges in providing clean water, which damages both public health and economic growth (Fig. 1 a ). Fig. 1 b shows that Pakistan's tap water is not safe to drink, which brings water quality problems to even greater attention. These results make it clear that Pakistan needs to improve water quality right away, handle water wells, and take long-term steps to ensure that its people have safe drinking water. The lack of adequate potable water hampers public health, economic development, and ecological harmony [17 ,18 ]. In Pakistan water politics, governance, entitlement, and allocation have been neglected because of the lack of comprehensive discourse on water concerns and solutions. Water is constitutionally a provincial responsibility; however, policies, institutions, and legal requirements are shared across the two levels, resulting in overlapping policies. Each province has its own rules and regulations supported by national provisions. Complexity, including several water-related ministries, institutions, and organizations has restricted practical implementation, causing federating unit tensions, intra-provincial disagreements, upstream-downstream farmer conflicts, and urban-rural differences. Therefore, it is crucial for Pakistan to have a more comprehensive conversation about water issues and to develop a transformative narrative that highlights 21st-century solutions. This groundbreaking narrative should be inspired by global trends but grounded in Pakistan's reality [7 ]. The United Nations General Assembly officially adopted the combination of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in September 2015, which were accompanied by a comprehensive set of 169 targets to manage economic, environmental, and social dimensions, such as reducing poverty, creating a healthy planet, and ensuring a prosperous and peaceful future for all [19 ,20 ]. Among them, SDG 6 focuses on water and sanitation, but it is crucial for the successful attainment of most SDGs since water is essential for human development and the health of ecosystems [21 ]. The SDGs cannot be achieved without natural ecosystems because they store, regulate, filter, and clean water [22 ]. It is imperative to possess a profound comprehension of the local and global complexities associated with water availability and utilization to determine whether the SDG targets about water are “SMART,” i.e., Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely [23 ]. The successful implementation of SDGs requires a comprehensive understanding of their interconnectedness and potential conflicts between targets. This necessitates a systemic approach that considers the interdependencies and pre-planning to avoid undesirable outcomes. To promote SDG implementation, research and evidence from the scientific community are crucial in evaluating and influencing policies at various scales [24 ,25 ]. The primary objective of this article is to analyse the sustainable water management practices in Pakistan, with a particular emphasis on their alignment with the UN SDG-6 roadmap. This study conducts a comprehensive examination of water resources in Pakistan and identifies the obstacles encountered in the realm of water management. The research emphasizes the significance of enhancing water governance, advocating for water conservation measures, and guaranteeing fair water allocation [26 ]. Further, the article looks into a study of the roles played by major stakeholders, including the governmental bodies, nonprofit organizations, and private enterprises in the successful execution of the SDG-6 roadmap.  2 A critical analysis of the Sustainable Development Goals The concept of sustainable development, which includes the idea of a sustainable society, originated from a particular historical context and should be considered within that framework for a better understanding of its meaning and implications [27 ]. The phrase “our common future” is used as the starting point in the discourse on sustainable development that is prevalent today [28 ]. Furthermore, the Brundtland report emphasized the significance of international cooperation as a crucial part of sustainable development [28 ]. This finding led to new inquiries and dialogues, augmenting awareness regarding the significance of sustainable development. Consequently, a collection of distinct objectives known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were established to achieve them between the years 2000 and 2015 [29 ]. The focus of the MDGs was to monitor the progress of countries in the southern hemisphere, primarily emphasizing development driven by human activities. Despite the substantial progress achieved during the period of implementation, the impact of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been significant [30 ,31 ]. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, aiming to establish a comprehensive framework that improves the well-being of both current and future generations. The agenda's core is the sustainable development goals, comprising seventeen (17) objectives aimed at enhancing global well-being. These goals are subcategorized into three main groups, as depicted in Fig. 2  . These groups include the three distinct aspects related to economy, society, and environment. Within the framework of the 17 SDGs, two distinct objectives exclusively focused on issues about water. Explicitly, SDG-06 focus on achieving the goal of universal access to clean water and sanitation, while SDG-14 emphasizes the preservation and sustainable management of marine resources to safeguard marine life. The UN-SDGs highlight the connection between water management and sustainable development while recognizing the substantial management, social, economic, and political problems associated with focusing both these agendas simultaneously [4 ]. SDG 6 was an important part of the United Nations' 2030 agenda, which contained a comprehensive set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [32 ]. The 2030 Agenda comprehensively addressed water resources, water supply, and sanitation with the initial UN focus on water in 1977 and emerging global concerns in the early 1990s. The ‘Dublin Principles’ were established in 1992 to guide integrated water resource management. In 2000, world leaders adopted the Millennium Declaration, with MDG 7C aiming to provide sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation by 2015. Initially, it only mentioned drinking water, whereas, sanitation was included in 2002. Water resources were indirectly considered in goals like poverty reduction, child mortality, disease prevention, and environmental sustainability. MDG efforts improved access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene [33 ]. Since 2015, there has been an improvement in the coverage of safely managed drinking water, with an increase from 69 % to 73 %, showing a rise from 56 % to 62 % in rural areas and from 80 % to 81 % in urban areas. Similarly, the coverage of safely managed sanitation has also increased since 2015, rising from 49 % to 57 % and 36 % to 46 % in rural and urban areas, respectively [34 ]. The development of SDG 6 was a turning point for the water sector. This aim stressed the need to tackle water concerns across the water cycle, beyond water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). SDG 6 addressed water quantity (scarcity), quality, efficiency, and ecosystems, to recognize their importance in sustainable development. It also supports transboundary water management, impacting a large amount of the Earth's geographical area, and Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) which crosses national boundaries. This milestone underlined the need to recognize water sector concerns and responsibilities [35 ]. Indicators are subject to design influence and measurement properties, which can affect the implications of derived information and their applications in development. Careful monitoring of indicators can lead to improved results and more accurate assessments in scientific and technical fields [36 ]. The absence of indicators may suggest that the final objective targets are not being met, indicating the need for more specific indicators to be established. The current indicators serve as evidence of progress towards the attainment of the specified objectives, and consequently, the overarching goals. In specific instances, the indicators may prove inadequate in achieving the targets [31 ,37 ]. SDG 6 goes beyond its initial focus on specific objectives concerning the provision of clean drinking water and sanitation as shown in Fig. 3   and Table 1   (targets 6.1 and 6.2). It encompasses a broader spectrum of concerns, including water quality and wastewater management (target 6.3), efficient water use (target 6.4), the implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM) principles (target 6.5), preservation of ecosystems (target 6.6), and the establishment of an enabling environment through targets 6a and 6b (Table 1 ). These diverse targets reflect an evolving recognition that achieving sustainable development necessitates a comprehensive approach to water resource management, resilience, and effective governance [38 ].  3 Water challenges and sustainable development in Pakistan Pakistan is ranked as the world's eighth most climate-vulnerable country, and the country's water security issues pose a significant obstacle to its economic and social development. The severe weather events, such as droughts and storms, make it imperative to manage Pakistan's water resources efficiently. The ongoing water crisis has led to increased urgency in discussions surrounding water resource policy. Pakistan first introduced water-focused policies in 1977, with a focus on conservation and environmental protection. In 1992, the National Conservation Strategy (NCS) was established, addressing a range of environmental concerns including water, sanitation, soil, air quality, forestry, and climate change. The following year, the Pakistan Sanitation Policy was introduced, aimed at promoting more participatory and localized approaches to water management and addressing deficiencies in water supply [7 ]. The National Water Policy launched in 2018 prioritized addressing this issue and established it as the most important objective for managing water at a national level [39 ]. This review paper aims to examine previous water policies concerning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and evaluate the current state of water resources, including their utilization across various sectors and the status of water governance. Additionally, this study provides comprehensive data on the availability of surface and groundwater resources classified by basins and offers insights into Pakistan's current water resources. An analysis of Pakistan's complex socio-hydrology is a key aspect of this study. 3.1 Pakistan's water sources Water resources in Pakistan have been classified into two main categories: natural and artificial sources. The total amount of natural resources encompasses a variety of elements such as rainfall, rivers and lakes, frozen masses, small bodies of water, as well as underground water reserves. Conversely, artificial means of water management include the collection and retention of surplus precipitation and river runoff through the construction of dams and reservoirs. These stored water sources serve multiple purposes such as irrigation, domestic water supply, and hydroelectric power generation [40 ]. 3.1.1 Natural resources of water The Indus River system is the primary water source in Pakistan, as illustrated in Fig. 4  . The present system can be perceived as a conical shape, wherein water from diverse sources combines to form a single river that flows towards the eastern region of Karachi and eventually runs into the Arabian Sea. Annually, the rim stations receive approximately 180 billion cubic meters (BCM) or 146.01 million acre-feet (MAF) of water from the western and eastern rivers and their respective branches. Approximately 128 billion cubic meters of this quantity is transmitted to the distribution network. The Indus River, along with its five primary tributaries, comprises a substantial irrigation network, ranking among the largest worldwide. The irrigation network in Pakistan's Indus Basin encompasses approximately 22.14 million hectares (mha) [41 ]. Table 2   displays the annual mean volumes of water flow (measured in MAF) for various time frames of rivers located in Pakistan. The flow of the Indus River displays fluctuations over time, with a range of 93 MAF observed between 1922 and 1961, decreasing to 62.7 MAF during 1985–1995, and subsequently increasing to 81.28 MAF during 2000–2009. There have been minor variations in flow in the years that followed. The Jhelum and Chenab Rivers exhibit variations in their mean discharge, with fluctuations in both directions observed over time. The average flows of the Ravi and Sutlej Rivers exhibit a declining trend, whereas the Kabul River displays some fluctuations. The aggregate yearly discharge of all rivers exhibits a range of fluctuation between 138 MAF and 156.51 MAF. In Pakistan, rainfall originates from two primary sources namely the Monsoons and the Western Disturbances. The Monsoon season, which occurs from July to September, accounts for approximately 70 % of the annual rainfall. The entire Indus Plain receives an average seasonal rainfall of 212 mm during the Kharif season and 53 mm during the Rabi season. The amounts of rainfall vary as one moves from the north and northeast towards the south of the country [40 ]. Fig. 5   depicts the average yearly rainfall in Pakistan over the past four years. In 2019–20, the average rainfall was 379.1 mm and 409.3 mm, slightly higher than the normal rainfall of 312.3 mm and 297.6 mm, respectively. However, in 2021, the actual rainfall in Pakistan was below average at 242.3 mm, compared to the normal rainfall of 297.6 mm, as shown in Fig. 5 . Pakistan is the most fortunate country in the world since it contains more glaciers than anywhere else on Earth, with only the North and South Poles having more. Comparatively, the Himalayas have only 17 % of their land covered by glaciers, whereas the European Alps cover 22 %. As a result of the majority of the river's flow occurring in the summer, the upper catchments of the Indus are believed to have a total glacial area of over 2250 sq. km [42 ]. There are 56 million gallons of water in the groundwater. Approximately 48 MAF (million acre-feet) of it are available. The water it produces is utilized for irrigating crops at a rate of 35 %. More than a million tube wells collect water from the ground without assessing their efficiency. Groundwater quality varies from saline to fresh, depending on the location [33 ].  3.1.2 Artificial source of water The biggest dams in Pakistan are Tarbela, Mangla Hub, and others. These dams not only provide water but also meet the energy needs of Pakistan. Tables 2 and 3   show major rivers and dams in Pakistan along with their capacities. Table 3  provides data regarding the primary reservoirs in Pakistan and their respective storage capacity measured in MAF. The Tarbela Dam and the Mangla Dam are two of the largest reservoirs in Pakistan. The former boasts a total storage capacity of 10.20 MAF, while the latter has a capacity of 5.60 MAF. Additional noteworthy reservoirs comprise Hub Dam with a capacity of 0.0924 MAF, while Tanda Dam, Khanpur Dam, Warsak Dam, Rawal Dam with a capacity of 0.0788 MAF, 0.059 MAF, 0.0475 MAF, and 0.0475 MAF, respectively. Reservoirs are of paramount importance in Pakistan's water storage and management system. More dams are required to fulfil water demand for irrigation, residential usage, and industry, particularly during droughts. They also provide a substantial contribution to hydroelectric power generation, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. However, careful consideration of environmental and societal consequences is required. To minimize harm to ecosystems and communities, proper environmental evaluations and mitigation strategies are required. It is critical to weigh the benefits of dams against their possible drawbacks. Sustainable practices and community involvement are critical for maximizing and ensuring a sustainable future for Pakistan.   3.2 Water consumption and availability in Pakistan Pakistan has been recognized as one of the countries facing significant water availability challenges, predominantly due to its considerable population. Since 1950, the amount of water that has been reachable on an annual basis per person has decreased from 5140 m3  to 1000 m3 , respectively [43 ]. In Pakistan, the distribution of water resources and consumption is depicted in Fig. 6  . The primary source of water is derived from rivers, which contribute approximately 77 % of the total surface water availability, while groundwater constitutes 15 %, and the combined contribution of rainfall and other sources accounts for 8 % [44 ]. An analysis of water usage patterns revealed that the agricultural sector utilizes a significant portion of available freshwater, amounting to 95 % of the total. Meanwhile, the industrial sector employs 2 % of the water resources, and the residential sector consumes the remaining 3 % [43 ]. Several causes are anticipated to lead to an increase in the demand for water such as exponential population growth, industrialization and advancement in socioeconomic standards etc. [1 ,43 ]. Table 4   displays the current and future water demands (measured in MAF) for various usage classifications in Pakistan, as well as the supplementary requirements estimated for the year 2025. The agricultural industry exhibits a rising inclination towards water demand, with a predicted supplementary demand of 12 MAF by the year 2025. The industrial and municipal sectors demonstrate a gradual rise in their water demands with an added requirement of 0.78 MAF and 3.60 MAF projected for the year 2025, respectively. The environmental industry, which encompasses the preservation of water for ecological purposes, exhibits a marginal rise. According to projections, the aggregate water demand in 2025 is estimated to reach 136 MAF, signifying a supplementary demand of 16.62 MAF in comparison to the current demand. Construction of dams in Pakistan's history has been relatively limited. Pakistan possessed three dams at the time of its independence: the Khushdil Khan Dam in 1890 and the Spin Karazi Dam in 1945; both located in the water-scarce region of Baluchistan. The only dam in Punjab was the Nomal Dam, constructed in Mianwali in 1913. Pakistan began construction of the Warsak Dam on the Kabul River near Peshawar in 1955 to reduce its power deficit. Pakistan constructed two massive dams as part of the Indus Basin Replacement Works, namely Mangla with a capacity of 5.60 MAF and Terbala with a capacity of 10.20 MAF. These dam projects are intended to increase the country's water availability and storage capacity [40 ]. The availability of water per capita in Pakistan is illustrated in Table 5  .  3.3 National framework for action on sustainable production and consumption for the water sector The challenge of promoting sustainable consumption and production of water is a significant issue for Pakistan. The accelerated pace of urbanization, coupled with a significant increase in population growth, unsustainable irrigation practices, industrialization, and the effects of climate change have collectively contributed to an unparalleled strain on the availability of water resources. The institutional framework for water management in Pakistan is characterized by fragmentation, indicating a critical need for the implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) across all tiers [45 ]. The Water action plan comprises four primary objectives that are time-based and aimed at effectively addressing the important Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets related to Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP). These four objectives are.i. Promotion of integrated water resource management  ii. Technical interventions that maintain macro- and micro-scale water availability and equal access, promote water quality management and resource protection.  iii. Water conservation in agriculture, irrigation, industry, and homes.  iv. Plan for water shortages and enhance capacity.    Table 6   and Fig. 7   present an overview of the national water policy action plans categorized into short-term, medium-term, and long-term, along with the respective departments responsible for their implementation for promoting sustainable consumption and production in the water sector.  3.4 Pakistan and SDG 6 Pakistan was one of the first member states committed to working towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Similar to other countries, Pakistan's socioeconomic growth and overall progress depend a lot on its water resources. However, the country's water sector is facing problems right now with both the amount and quality of water. The issues are exacerbated by the anticipated impacts of climate change and the increasing water demand. Pakistan stands to gain significant advantages from accomplishing all aspects of SDG 6 [46 ]. Pakistan, like many other developing nations, fell short of the MDGs in the past due to a few key reasons such as insufficient knowledge of the MDGs, insufficient institutional capacity and insufficient political will and commitment. Systematic efforts are also required to determine realistic targets establish adequate baselines, and allocate sufficient resources [47 ]. According to the global SDGs ranking, Pakistan ranks 125 out of 163 countries in 2022, with a score of 59.30 [48 ]. To accomplish the SDGs, including the water-related objectives, substantial efforts are required to develop new infrastructure, upgrade existing infrastructure, invest in innovative technologies, and strengthen capacities and governance at multiple levels [46 ]. Ensuring the quality of fresh water and preventing the escalation of water treatment and management costs are crucial for providing more people with access to clean water improved hygiene, and better sanitation practices. To achieve these goals, substantial efforts and alignment of methods with the country's needs are necessary. The responsibility for monitoring and reporting on SDG-6 in Pakistan is shared among various organizations, with the Ministry of Water Resources overseeing the compilation of national progress related to different indicators within SDG-6 as shown in Table 7  . Line ministries collect data from relevant provincial institutions and aggregate them for comprehensive national reports, which are then validated and endorsed by national offices of United Nations organizations before submission to the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). Furthermore, the UN supports national organizations in compiling the national report and ensuring adherence to the methodology for each indicator, target and goal, resulting in accurate and methodical reporting of progress towards SDG-6 in Pakistan [49 ]. 3.4.1 SDG 6 Policy Support System (PSS) The United Nations University – Institute of Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH), Canada, in collaboration with the Korean Environment Corporation (K-eco) and the Ministry of Environment - Republic of Korea, set out on a two-year project in reaction to the implementation of the sustainable development agenda. The objective of the project was to advance the achievement of SDGs related to water in five Member States of the United Nations, one of which is Pakistan. The main objective was to incorporate SDGs related to water into the planning and policy-making procedures of Pakistan, Ghana, Tunisia, South Korea, and Costa Rica. Additionally, the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) conducts research on water resources [46 ]. As part of its transnational initiative, PCRWR conducted nationwide seminars for national and provincial organizations, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions. These workshops concluded with the following remarks:(i) The devolution of powers and the 18th Amendment to Pakistan's Constitution have complicated water governance and Goal 6 duties.  (ii) Key stakeholders are uninformed of Goal 6's aims and indicators.  (iii) In Pakistan's context, a total of 11 indicators align with 11 distinct representative instruments.    During these sessions, PCRWR began considering the implications of Goal 6. As part of its initiative, the program of the UNU-INWEH has established regional hub countries. During this stage, the nations that were involved in the preceding phase were given the responsibility of serving as regional hub countries. They are aiding their neighboring nations in comprehending, establishing objectives, and striving towards establishing aspects of SDG 6 via the SDG Policy Support System (PSS) of the United Nations University (UNU). SDG-PSS is an online tool that enables countries to input data systematically and rigorously. The PSS centers its attention on six fundamental constituents that are crucial for the formulation of policies. These constituents include the evaluation of SDG 6 progress, assessment of capacities, inclusion of women into goal financing, reducing disaster risks and resilience planning, and evaluation of policies and institutions (Fig. 8  ). It uses questionnaires for each component of the SDG-PSS with questions for each indicator to collect data. This system serves as a solid foundation for countries to adopt a structured, methodological approach to inform their policies and decisions aimed at achieving SDG 6 by 2030 [46 ,50 ]. It empowers policymakers, researchers, and development professionals to gather crucial information and evidence to shape national policies that address water-related issues [51 ]. The SDG 6 PSS can be accessed online through the SDG Policy Support System website (https://sdgpss.net/en/home ).  3.4.2 PCRWR's contribution to the SDG 06 Policy Support System To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) of the United Nations, which is “Clean Water and Sanitation,” the PCRWR has taken a prominent role, overseeing crucial projects that will aid Pakistan in becoming more water-sustainable. The PCRWR's assertive participation and valuable contributions to the SDG 6 Policy Support System have not only accelerated Pakistan's progress towards this goal but also revolutionized the way water resources are managed in the country. As PSS centers its attention on six fundamental constituents (as shown in Fig. 8 ) that are crucial for the formulation of policies. These constituents include the evaluation of SDG 6 progress, assessment of capacities, inclusion of women into goal financing, reducing disaster risks and resilience planning, and evaluation of policies and institutions. So, in the case of Pakistan, the PCRWR's contribution to these fundamental constituents is as follows. 3.4.2.1 Capacity and finance The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) describes capacity development as the process by which individuals, organizations, and societies acquire and enhance the abilities necessary to achieve their own development goals over time [52 ]. The SDG6 for clean water and sanitation depends on the capabilities of people, organizations, and societies. The financial requirements for universal access to water, sanitation, and hygiene may exceed $50 billion annually. The Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water (GLAAS) highlights the need for national funding to meet targets like SDGs 6.1 and 6.2. In Pakistan, although there is a well-defined institutional setup and policies for SDG 6.3, weak governance and inadequate financial allocation are issues. The SDG Policy Support System (SDG-PSS) helps identify financial capacity gaps. Provincial governments, like Sindh, align budget allocations with SDGs, and the PSS assists public institutions in estimating resources for their 2030 goals. Estimating investment as a percentage of GDP for SDG 6 is a complex task for economies such as Pakistan, and the finance component of the PSS uses guidelines from GLAAS and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to aid financial planning and investment forecasting [46 ].  3.4.2.2 Policy and institution The institutional frameworks outlined in Pakistan's National Water Policy of 2018 and National Drinking Water Policy since 2009 aim to achieve SDG 6.4. However, like many other low and middle-income countries, Pakistan faces challenges in implementing these policies. To support national development, PCRWR's PSS has developed a structured questionnaire framework that provides insights into a country's governance mechanism and helps align governance with national development objectives [46 ].  3.4.2.3 Gender There are different ideas on how to understand and use gender mainstreaming in different countries and cultures. In Pakistan, some parts of SDG 6 show unequal treatment between men and women, especially in terms of ecological control and relationship involvement. For instance, men are more likely to conduct fieldwork than women because of the community norms that value male involvement. Despite this, the PSS part of SDG 6 uses a gender-mainstreaming approach. Moreover, the PCRWR's efforts go beyond academic models and can be seen in real-world projects. For example, they work to obtain water laws that consider the needs and roles of women through lobbying and studies. Additionally, the PCRWR runs training programs and classes to give women the information and skills they need to be involved in making decisions and managing water issues. These are referred to as “capacity-building” activities [46 ].  3.4.2.4 Disaster risk reduction (DRR)/resilience Water-related natural disasters in Pakistan pose significant challenges to water resource management and planning. Incorporating disaster risk reduction (DRR) components presents an opportunity to promote sustainable development from a disaster resilience perspective. Within the realm of water-related policies, integrating DRR and resilience-building efforts involves safeguarding critical infrastructure, allocating appropriate budgets for risk assessments and resilience priorities, and enhancing the knowledge and skills of key personnel in DRR and mitigation. Addressing existing challenges and preparing for the future requires a focus on assessing and comprehending water-related disaster risks and sharing this understanding across government bodies. The Sendai Framework for DRR (2015–2030), which succeeded the Hyogo Framework for Action (2005–2015), was adopted at the Third UN World Conference in Sendai, Japan, in 2015 [53 ], and Pakistan is a signatory. The PCRWR's PSS aligns primarily with the planning, policy, and preparedness objectives outlined in the Sendai Framework [46 ].  3.4.2.5 Integrity/transparency Corruption is a universal obstacle to the economic and social progress of developing, emerging, and developed countries. It includes practices such as bribery, embezzlement, and nepotism and harms businesses by increasing costs and undermining clean governance. International and national efforts are necessary to combat corruption in the water sector. The Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources is crucial for maintaining the integrity of its Policy Support System, which is essential for effective water resource management. The council's contributions include data collection, analysis, and collaboration with government agencies and stakeholders to establish transparent methodologies. Their commitment to accuracy and capacity building strengthens the PSS, ensuring the reliability of data for informed water management decisions in Pakistan.     4 Roadmap to achieve UN Sustainability Development Goal SDG 06 SDG 6 requires a complete assessment of socio-economic water needs at the public level as well as the establishment of a centralized database to mitigate adverse environmental indicators at the local to global scale. Such initiatives are essential for promoting economic growth in the water and sanitation sectors and related fields. When it comes to emerging markets, Pakistan is a major player. Human consumption of water resources and the availability of sanitary infrastructure substantially contribute to environmental stress, social adversity, and economic disparities. Pakistan has suffered from a severe water shortage in recent years, making water utilization challenging. The escalating demand for water driven by population growth, urbanization, and industrial expansion, is placing increased stress on water supply. To effectively address these challenges and achieve SDG6, a focused approach involving proper management, strategic investment, and heightened public awareness is crucial. This study delves into the detailed roadmap essential for successfully realizing SDG6 in developing countries, with a specific focus on Pakistan. The proposed strategy involves a comprehensive evaluation and customization of indicators, recognition of interdependencies with other SDGs, establishment of robust support systems, adoption of cutting-edge technologies, ensuring financial adequacy, prioritizing water storage infrastructure and drawing insights from past experiences. The implementation of this holistic approach is vital for ensuring sustainable water management in Pakistan, contributing to global endeavours to meet the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. 4.1 SDG 06 indicator assessment and recommendation To assess the sustainability of water utilization by both humans and the environment, it is necessary to employ both quantitative and qualitative indicators [54 ]. Indicators provide policymakers with guidance on sustainable pathways, necessitating adherence to the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) principles during their development and ensuring ease of implementation. Indicators should not be comprehended as strict directives for implementation, as each nation bears the responsibility of customizing the SDGs to suit its specific needs and devising strategies to achieve them. Instead, indicators act as benchmarks that measure progress towards the goals and offer crucial data that helps countries create their strategies and plans. They provide a framework for tracking and assessing the success of the policies and actions implemented by various nations to achieve the SDGs [55 ]. There are inherent tensions between indicators about the availability of “safe water” and factors like access and cost, which make it hard to use different measurements together to measure progress towards the overall goal of providing water and sanitation to everyone. While the management of a drinking water service may be effectively implemented, it is important to recognize that the metric assessing the percentage of the populace utilizing safely managed drinking water services does not encompass the accessibility or impartial allocation of water. The primary objective of this indicator is to evaluate the safety and quality of potable water, while not explicitly tackling the matters of affordability or equitable distribution of water resources among all members of society. People living in cities have to buy water from private sellers to meet their daily needs. This means that the cost per liter of water is much higher than that of people living in the same area but have more money [56 ,57 ]. Human rights and effective governance, grounded in the principles of the rule of law, play a crucial role in significantly facilitating the promotion of sustainable development. Sustainable Development Goal 16 includes those aspects and is centered on promoting strong institutions, justice, and peace. The aforementioned objective presents a more comprehensive structure for addressing the significance of human rights and efficient governance in attaining sustainable development goals [58 ]. Several of the indicators in Table 8   will be evaluated mainly at the national level, which means that the complex relationship between local processes and risks and the larger global dynamics, which can have big and possibly irreversible effects on both people and the environment, will not be taken into account. The evaluation of worldwide water resources may fail to account for significant local factors that contribute to water-related hazards. A complete understanding of water risks requires the consideration of both local and global scales. By implementing a continuous methodology that spans from the local to the global level, it becomes possible to evaluate systemic risks that affect a variety of sectors. The adoption of this methodology is imperative to provide policymakers with precise data on advancements and to formulate a pragmatic worldwide outlook on sustainability. At the international level, it is imperative to implement appropriate risk assessment protocols to ascertain whether human actions are functioning within a secure and enduring threshold within the worldwide water system. These measures are implemented to guarantee the sustainability and well-being of water resources for both current and future generations [59 ]. To achieve SDG 06 in Pakistan, it is vital to conduct a thorough assessment of relevant indicators, including evaluating the country's current water infrastructure, water quality, and accessibility levels. The aim is to develop suggestions that specifically address Pakistan's unique challenges and opportunities, ensuring a targeted and effective strategy. The evaluation process must consider an appropriate number of variables, striking a balance between comprehensiveness and manageability for effective monitoring and analysis. Using scenario analysis allows for the exploration of various potential water futures, and evaluating the selected indicators' effectiveness in capturing outcomes. This approach enhances the understanding of the possible courses of action and consequences related to water, making the chosen indicators more meaningful. Scientific evidence, supported by reliable time-series data is crucial for identifying viable options, understanding limitations, and assessing the societal impact of not achieving water-related goals. Accurate evaluation criteria are essential for understanding the link between stressors and freshwater ecosystem health. Table 8  outlines potential measures and recommendations for future research in this context.  4.2 Comprehending the relationships among the SDGs A vital step towards achieving overall sustainable development in Pakistan is to examine the intricate ways in which the SDGs are interconnected. This requires understanding how various SDGs interact to support each other and creating plans that capitalize on these connections. In Pakistan, SDG 6 (which addresses clean water and sanitation) is closely linked to SDG1 (which targets poverty reduction), SDG3 (which aims to improve health), and SDG13 (which focuses on environmental protection). By comprehending these connections, lawmakers can formulate integrated plans and programs that ensure growth in one area benefits others. This approach is essential for devising a more unified and effective sustainable development plan in Pakistan, where multiple problems often coexist [60 ]. Understanding the interconnections of the SDGs is crucial in formulating effective policies and measures. Being unable to achieve targets related to water could increase the possibility of losing in achieving other goals. Achieving the goals of clean water and sanitation, as outlined in SDG-6 is crucial in the promotion of goals about the preservation of land and aquatic ecosystems, as indicated in SDGs 14 and 15. The failure to achieve SDG-6 has the potential to impede the advancement of the associated objectives. The prioritization of water targets has the potential to yield positive outcomes in the accomplishment of other SDGs [61 ]. Researchers across different fields such as hydrology, agriculture, energy, land management, and climate science are progressively acknowledging the significance of interrelatedness, commonly known as the nexus among water, food, energy, land, and climate [62–64 ]. These researchers agree that a full understanding of how these important links work is a key part of future sustainable development projects and an important step in the fight against global environmental change [65 ]. Numerous studies have been conducted on integrated water resources management (IWRM); a framework that emphasizes the comprehensive advancement and management of water resources. The objective of IWRM is to guarantee an ongoing and impartial utilization of water resources, taking into account the interrelated social, economic, and environmental dimensions [66 ]. The present study attempts to establish a broad comprehension of the interdependencies among water and other significant domains, such as agriculture, energy, urban and rural development, among others. The objective of this study is to enhance policy formulation by examining the complex interrelationships between water and various sectors, thereby facilitating more efficient and unified decision-making procedures [67 ], the selection of technologies [68 ], and the necessary institutional arrangements [69 ]. This research has the potential to serve as an important foundation upon which to develop subsequent work in the context of the new SDGs for discovering and comprehending the links between those goals to facilitate synergistic measures.  4.3 Supporting SDG implementation In terms of water governance, the determined SDGs encounter significant challenges. Despite the scarcity of water in some areas, poor or inadequate governance is often the root cause of many water-related issues. In many nations, lack of institutional capacity is a major cause of poor water governance [51 ]. The SDGs must be implemented with a focus on institution-building if they are to accomplish their goals. This involves developing institutions for water governance that are open and inclusive, accountable, transparent, responsive, consensus-based, effective, and efficient while adhering to the rule of law. The SDG process can promote strong and sustainable water governance systems by implementing such frameworks. It calls for greater transboundary and global water governance and emphasizes the importance of access to justice and law [50 ]. To transform the SDG process into a global force that propels revolutionary change towards sustainability, it is necessary to cultivate political will, strengthen institutional capacity, and promote good governance. Effective leadership and advocacy, integrating sustainability into policies, strengthening institutions, promoting multi-stakeholder collaboration, ensuring accountability and transparency, encouraging participatory decision-making, facilitating knowledge sharing and technology transfer, and fostering international cooperation and resource mobilization can help in achieving this goal. Collectively, these measures contribute to the establishment of a global framework that drives significant and transformative progress towards sustainable development objectives. Involve policymakers, corporate leaders, scientists and civil society representatives in developing harmonized and integrated regulations and policies. Putting the SDGs into action involves a societal evolution. It is important to let more people know that the SDGs and public benefits are directly interlinked. It is more beneficial to discuss methods for making water potable rather than focusing on water quality in general without considering the involvement of people. In Pakistan, the task is the synchronization of national policies with the aims set out by the SDGs. This necessitates the establishment of partnerships and cooperation among governmental entities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the business sector. Additionally, it means actively including local people in the processes of decision-making. A comprehensive endeavor across several levels of governance is essential to achieve the seamless integration of the SDGs into Pakistan's socioeconomic agenda.  4.4 Improving technologies for innovation Numerous water initiatives and solutions exist on a global scale to address these issues, but they frequently employ a narrow perspective and have limited geographic reach. Scientists are focusing on comprehending the causes as well as the effects of global change, while corporations work to develop innovative methods and goods. Policymakers at all levels are working to mitigate the effects on the environment and respond effectively to these effects. Awareness is raised through NGOs, which also take proactive measures to safeguard both humans and wildlife and offer assistance. Even though considerable efforts are going on, however, sustainable development needs more innovation in the technical, social, and institutional fields. The growing need for significant reduction of environmental impacts arising from human consumption, including but not limited to water pollution and over-extraction, indicates that relying solely on current technologies for adaptation is inadequate. Instead, a strategic shift and the establishment of a framework that prioritizes integrated solutions and strengthens connections between problem identifiers, solution implementers, knowledge generators, and knowledge implementers are necessary. To overcome the issue of insufficient translation of evidence-based knowledge from water science to policy formulation and application, implementing an integrated and solution-oriented approach can serve as a beneficial solution. The previously mentioned methodology involves the development of a path that links concrete measures and attempts to attain solutions via a cooperative and analytical evaluation of information. The identification of best practices in technological, institutional, and social innovation could be promoted through meaningful and continuous engagement among various stakeholders, such as scientists, industry experts, policymakers, and civil society. The collective work has the potential to facilitate the formulation of policies that are congruent with both ecological and financial objectives, thereby avoiding any potential clashes between them. The incorporation of innovation and technology plays a crucial role in advancing water management and is particularly vital for Pakistan. Prioritizing the improvement of existing technology, adopting water-efficient practices in agriculture, and exploring new methods for wastewater treatment are the key strategies. State-of-the-art technology not only boosts operational efficiency but also aligns with multiple SDGs, especially SDG 6. However, significant challenges are expected across the scientific, professional, and social realms. Finding definitive solutions before integrating SDGs seems unlikely, emphasizing the need for ongoing scientific engagement and support for at least the next 15 years. The implementation process should be flexible, focusing on a continuous “learning by doing and improving” approach in various aspects [58 ,70 ].  4.5 Provision of funds for Sustainable Development Goal 6 The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is a determined plan, necessitates novel and inventive financing strategies to provide support for the essential projects and programs that are crucial for the accomplishment of the goals in the future. These approaches must be considered to meet the requirements of the ambitious agenda. The current state of municipal water systems is one of under-resourcing, under-valuing, and underpricing. Pricing water is one of several strategies that can be utilized to advance justice, efficiency, and long-term sustainability in the water industry; nevertheless, despite its seeming simplicity conceptually, it may be one of the most politically challenging strategies to put into practice. For instance, in most countries, the conventional command and control system employed for water management necessitates substantial government involvement due to the need for comprehensive, hands-on monitoring and measurement. On the contrary, the implementation of price policies necessitates significant government intervention to ensure that concerns about equality and public goods are adequately addressed [71 ]. In the past few years, several creative approaches for funding social services have been created. It could be employed as a model to guide the development of new types of finance. NGOs have been implementing a variety of innovative financial solutions, some of which include the use of donor funds (which do not receive returns) to serve as seed capital for social service providers and the use of commercial investors to provide the remaining funds required to support the service while receiving competitive returns. Both of these approaches represent innovative financial solutions. The importance of innovation is dependent upon the establishment of a carefully organized framework of incentives that is appealing to all principal parties involved, thereby guaranteeing the efficient funding and execution of the SDGs [72 ]. In addition to the development of novel models, it is crucial to consider issues on project monitoring and evaluation to facilitate the effective implementation of sustainable development plans. While new funding and accounting structures will be necessary, they alone will not be sufficient. Traditional barriers would be overcome by new technologies and business approaches. Large capital investments for WaSH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) infrastructure have hampered large-scale implementation in underdeveloped nations. Newly established enterprises offer cost-effective decentralized solutions that incorporate waste value chain models, which transform waste into renewable energy and organic fertilizer [73 ]. Reducing risk is of significance when employing conventional financing approaches to support novel infrastructure and development initiatives. By providing incentives such as competitive rewards or risk mitigation, it is possible to attract investments and tap into previously unexplored resources. The presence of favorable results serves as a magnet for both public and private funding. According to current research, there exists a positive correlation between the perceived benefits of enhanced water services and users' willingness to pay a premium for such services [74 ]. Traditional structures (wells, canals etc.) constructed by people have historically served as the means for meeting the water needs of the general population. However, relying solely on traditional infrastructure (grey infrastructure) poses a risk of disrupting vital biophysical processes to sustain ecosystems, habitats, and modes of life. To enhance the efficiency and durability of dams and effectively address the water requirements of both current and coming generations, it is necessary to supplement conventional grey infrastructure with ecologically sustainable green infrastructure. The approach involves using natural or nature-derived remedies in conjunction with traditional infrastructure [75 ]. In the pursuit of SDG 6 in Pakistan, securing adequate funds is crucial for the success of water-related initiatives. Pakistan grapples with significant challenges in water management, encompassing issues of accessibility, quality, and infrastructure. Addressing these challenges and making tangible progress towards SDG 6 requires a substantial and targeted financial commitment. To achieve this, Pakistan can explore international partnerships and collaborations with organizations and donor agencies, tapping into external financial resources and technical expertise. Mobilizing domestic funds through public-private partnerships and government investments is equally vital for sustained progress. The private sector, known for its innovative solutions, can play a key role in contributing to the necessary funds for water infrastructure development. Ensuring transparent financial mechanisms and accountability measures is essential for efficient fund utilization. Incentivizing private investments through mechanisms like tax breaks can encourage active participation from non-governmental entities. By prioritizing fund provision and establishing robust financial frameworks, Pakistan can pave the way for the successful implementation of SDG 6, addressing water challenges and contributing to the broader sustainable development goals of the nation.  4.6 The significance of storage facilities for water Infrastructure makes it easier for water to move between the environment and society, as well as between different parts of society. Infrastructure helps reduce inequality. Water storage plays a significant role in large-scale water infrastructure to offset the effects of scarce and unpredictable water and its inability to meet demand [76 ]. Dams and reservoirs are the most controversial large-scale engineering projects. The presence of dams brings attention to the contentious nature of technical solutions, with underlying ideological disagreements. The human ecosystem, terrestrial ecology, and freshwater ecosystem have been subjected to adverse impacts. The building of water reservoirs forces people to move, and the difference between the people who benefit from new infrastructure (usually those who live downstream) and the local people who are affected is a big problem both within a country and across borders [77 ]. It has been suggested that climate change adaptation and the SDGs can only be fulfilled by building more water storage [78 ]. Water for human security and other dimensions of well-being are positively connected with water storage capacity per capita [3 ]. Massive dam development, fueled by private investment, is underway to meet growing electricity needs [79 ]. Valuable lessons can be gleaned from constructing dams that meet human water needs while minimizing the impact on river systems through careful engineering practices. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) study reported that climate change would exacerbate weather and stream flow extremes. Longer droughts and bigger floods require more storage space. Reservoirs have the potential to make significant contributions towards the accomplishment of various SDGs including but not limited to power, food, and water security, as well as lowering the risk of catastrophe. However, it is important to acknowledge that they can also present certain ecological challenges. Improper design and management of reservoirs can have adverse effects on freshwater ecosystems. Achieving a sustainable future requires careful consideration of both the advantages and potential ecological impacts associated with the construction of dams [80 ,81 ]. Groundwater reserves are the other major type of freshwater storage, and just like surface water reserves, they have specific “infrastructure requirements” that must be met for them to be used in an environmentally responsible manner. Notwithstanding, achieving efficient management frequently necessitates substantial initial investments and strengthening the governance framework for resource management [82 ]. In Pakistan's water management system, storage facilities are vital for ensuring a stable water supply in the face of shortages and uneven distribution. Reservoirs and dams play a key role in capturing water during surplus periods and mitigating droughts, and irregular rainfall. These storage facilities regulate irrigation for agriculture, contribute to flood control, and protect infrastructure and livelihoods. Strategic investment in their development aligns with SDG 6, which addresses water scarcity and promotes sustainability.  4.7 Learning from past management, technological, training, social incentive, and multi-level efforts It is important for developing nations to improve their monitoring capabilities about the SDGs. The existence of worldwide data platforms, such as UNEP Live may serve as a motivation for nations to provide data, as they strive to avoid being depicted as deficient in information on global maps [58 ]. The “tragedy of the averages,” on the other hand, should be avoided at all costs because the natural geography of the majority of countries is quite diverse. Data that has been frequently averaged presents a highly distorted image. For less developed nations, the idea of monitoring ladders or monitoring stages, each with varying degrees of intricacy, may be helpful and even doable. Enhanced capacity building may be of assistance to decision-makers in determining more effective and long-term solutions using systemic techniques. Monitoring of the SDGs ought to involve participation from all tiers of society, including the public sector, the academic community, non-governmental organizations, and others. In real-world scenarios, implementing these initiatives and addressing the challenges that arise when people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds attempt to contribute can be extremely difficult. One strategy involves acknowledging that different societal levels should focus on the tasks that are most suited to them. It is essential for educational institutions to actively participate in the collection of data, the creation of knowledge, and the alignment of societal aspirations with sustainable development targets. Administrators must establish effective mechanisms to implement policies and attain national development goals. The responsibility of the general populace is to promote cost-effective and enduring services, such as the availability of unpolluted potable water and an unpolluted ecosystem, by applying influence on decision-makers and the governing body. Modern digital technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way information is gathered and analyzed in the field of data acquisition and monitoring. These technologies encompass widely used devices like smartphones and hand-held computers. While citizen science holds significant promise in certain fields, its applicability may be limited in situations where data quality, calibration, or standardization are concerning due to inherent limitations. Despite this, it has a significant part to play in bringing awareness to the issue as well as contributing to efforts being made towards monitoring and implementation [37 ]. Pakistan's water management policy should draw lessons from past initiatives. Reflecting on earlier experiences, including technology innovations, training, societal incentives, and multi-level efforts, helps identify strengths and weaknesses. Policymakers can enhance responses to current challenges by learning from both successes and failures. Understanding the impact of past technology solutions and evaluating training programs informs future decisions. Experience guides the development of social incentives, such as community involvement and awareness campaigns. Adopting a “learning by doing and improving” approach enables adaptable techniques for sustainable water resource management in Pakistan.   5 Pakistan's water future: speculating about 2025 The water problem in Pakistan is getting worse by the day, and it is going to affect both the agricultural and industrial sectors of the country. Pakistan's situation is exacerbated by the fact that approximately $21 billion worth of water is lost to the ocean annually due to inadequate storage capacity. Alternately, the precariously low levels of groundwater reserves are a direct result of the excessive pumping of groundwater. The agrarian population, which consumes the biggest percentage of water, also contributes to the highest percentage of wastewater due to mismanagement. This is because of a lack of understanding among the agrarian community [83 ]. The Pakistani Council of Common Interests gave its final approval to the country's historic National Water Policy (NWP) in 2018. As per the report, a proportion of 10 % of the funds allocated by the national Public Sector Development Program will be specifically allocated towards the development of water infrastructure [84 ]. Noticeably, Pakistan's Vision 2025 understands that abundant, reliable, clean, and cost-effective water is essential for sustainable economic growth and development. Integrated policy and execution have failed these crucial sectors. Climate change has exacerbated this difficulty. The presence of a revitalized national consensus on substantial new commitments and investments, achieved through unprecedented public-private collaboration, is a cause for satisfaction. These efforts aim to bridge extensive gaps that pose a threat to our nation's progress. It is highly recommended to encourage ways to save water, use it more efficiently and invest in new water sources at the same time [85 ]. One of the top priorities of Vision 2025 is ensuring that all users, including those in agriculture, industry, and the residential sector, have access to sufficient supplies of water. For Pakistan Vision 2025 to become a reality, it is necessary to implement policies that will balance the demand and supply of resources, with a particular emphasis on both sides of the equation. The following are our top five priorities concerning water safety [85 ]:1. The goal is to increase the water preservation capability following the specific needs of individual provinces. The aim is to increase the storage duration from the present 30-day period to 45 days by 2018, and subsequently achieve a storage duration of 90 days by 2025. This will improve the overall capacity to retain water over a prolonged duration.  2. Make investments in tried-and-true methods and technology to reduce waste (for example, in the agriculture sector), encourage conservation, and generate savings through rationalizing pricing.  3. allocate resources more efficiently by making direct reference to national and provincial priorities as well as relevant social and economic considerations  4. The aim is to establish institutional frameworks, such as a National Water Commission, to effectively govern all water resources, including surface, subsurface, and precipitation-derived water. These mechanisms will be responsible for the distribution of water to various sectors and regions, including but not limited to agriculture, industry, and urban areas.  5. Ensuring universal access to a defined minimum quantity of safe drinking water for every individual in Pakistan.    As mentioned before, Pakistan is planning to raise its overall storage capacity by the year 2025. The WAPDA (Water and Power Development Authority) has compiled a list, organized by priority, of potential big dams to be built in the future, along with the amount of space each one will provide in Table 9  . The effective implementation of a comprehensive National Water Policy is crucial which should encompass a transparent and well-organized institutional framework that aligns with the contemporary requirements and takes into consideration the implications of climate change. The strategy for mitigating water scarcity in Pakistan involves a multifaceted approach that integrates technological advancements, social incentives, and awareness campaigns. The objective is to optimize resource utilization through a comprehensive review of equitable water usage taxes and incentives, promoting responsible consumption practices, and implementing rainwater capture systems at various scales, including lakes, ponds, households, and communities. Developed countries bring their expertise and aid, whereas emerging economies offer cost-effective solutions. International partnerships and funding initiatives play a crucial role in advancing SDG 6. Examples from Belgium and South Africa, as highlighted by Long et al. [86 ] and Jennifer et al. [87 ], show how each country's unique experiences, resources, and strategies contribute to global efforts to ensure access to clean water and sanitation. This highlights the shared responsibility across borders to achieve this goal. The water resources of Pakistan face severe stress. It is imperative for all stakeholders, including policymakers and government officials, to recognize the situation and take responsible measures for sustainable management. This involves developing new water resources through the construction of small, medium, and large dams where possible; managing existing resources; increasing productivity; implementing appropriate pricing systems; and identifying suitable crop zones based on water availability in specific regions. Additionally, reviewing the export policy of agricultural commodities is crucial to ensuring that Pakistan grows crops essential for national food security while minimizing virtual water exports. Local governments and non-profit institutions in Pakistan should prioritize collaboration, technological innovation, community engagement, and sound financial strategies to achieve the targets outlined in SDG 6. This approach not only addresses immediate water challenges but also contributes to the broader goal of sustainable water management in Pakistan. To promote sustainable sanitation in Pakistan, its approach to total sanitation should be improved by enhancing the quality and safety of WASH infrastructure and implementing safe management practices for human waste. Provincial and local governments should follow the guidelines of the National Sanitation Policy and develop awareness, education, and training programs. Federal and provincial governments must allocate sufficient resources to achieve the SDG 6 targets, and the Policy Support System (PSS) developed by the United Nations University, which is available online, can be used to monitor progress.  6 Conclusion The inclusion of SDG-06, which centers on water, into the broader framework of the 17 SDGs underscores the fundamental significance of water in the pursuit of sustainable development. The component of water has a complex relationship with a multitude of objectives, including but not limited to the provision of uncontaminated potable water, hygienic sanitation practices, and the conservation of the natural surroundings to ensure enduring viability. The current global water crisis presents a formidable set of obstacles, including but not limited to water scarcity, contamination, and biodiversity depletion. To tackle these obstacles, it is essential to ensure efficient execution and surveillance, which entails devising uncomplicated and SMART metrics that encompass advancements as well as enduring sustainability. Although official indicators may have limitations in providing progress, there exists a scientific prospect to create supplementary indicators and hazard measurements on a worldwide, regional, and local scale. The aforementioned evaluations possess the capability to guide decisions regarding investments, mold establishments, and promote synchronization towards the attainment of sustainable water management. The comprehension of complicated stressor interactions and their effects on freshwater ecosystems necessitates the implementation of scientifically valid evaluation and regulating protocols. Through the establishment of effective process linkages, it is possible to preserve the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems and promote a viable and enduring future for humanity. The results of this study offer significant perspectives to decision-makers in Pakistan, enabling them to efficiently attain SDG-6 objectives and advance sustainable water management methodologies in the nation. By recognizing the inter relationships and leveraging scientific knowledge, policymakers can drive synergistic actions towards sustainable development.
