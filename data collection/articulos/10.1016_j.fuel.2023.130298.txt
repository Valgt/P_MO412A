                  Biogas production by anaerobic digestion is a potential technique for waste management and reduce carbon footprint. Heat capacity and fuel efficiency of biogas make it as an interesting alternative to the depleting nonrenewable fuels. The full potential of anaerobic digestion is not realized yet due to operational difficulties, government policies and people acceptance. This review focuses on the bottle necks in the biogas production technology and highlights some of the recent technology that can be adopted to achieve circular economy in biogas sector. In a waste to energy perspective, the presence of recalcitrant lignocelluloses in the available biowaste is discussed. Various pretreatment techniques used to convert these recalcitrant materials to suit anaerobic digestion are compared. Microalgal culture techniques for waste treatment and biogas upgradation are seen as a promising strategy towards clean energy. In many cases the impurities present in the biogas limit its usage. Hence, more emphasis for biogas upgradation by adopting advanced methods like facilitated transport in a nanocellulose membrane is needed. Implementation of biogas as an alternative to fossil fuels has both technological and policy related barriers. Biogas helps to attain sustainability development goals proposed by the United Nations. This review discusses the technological aspects of biogas production alongside the application of biogas to attain sustainability in the fuel sector. In various sections, we highlight the technical difficulties in biogas production, solutions for those problems, and potential of biogas technology in achieving sustainable goals.

Methods Type of pretreatment Principle Effect of the technique Disadvantage References Recent studies   Physical Mechanical size reduction Reduce the crystallinity of cellulose fibers. Eliminate mass and heat transfer limitation. 10–30 mm after chipping 0.2 – 2 mm after milling or grinding Energy requirement for size reduction is more   [8]  Mechanical pre-treatment of Sargassum fulvellum  microalgae resulted in increased methane production by 52.34 % than without treatment [9] .  Ultrasonication Cavitation cleaves the complex lignocelluloses using shear forces Reduce the hydrolysis time by 80 % High energy requirement [55]  [22]  used ultrasound pre-treatment to increase methane yield (107.28 mL methane/g VS) by 4 folds (26.72 mL methane/g VS) in brewer’s spent grains.  [34]  studied dual frequency ultrasound combined with alkali treatment on corn stalk resulted in 56.6 % increase in methane production than the control without pretreatment.  Chemical Alkali pretreatment Increase cellulose swelling, decrease the degree of polymerization and crystallinity. Increases lignin breakdown by destructing links between lignin and other polymers Perform partial hydrolysis of lignocelluloses Method is ineffective for higher lignin content biomass. High chemical load Toxicity to microbes [109]  [63]  reported 65.48 % increase in methane content from AD of food waste pretreated with Calcium hydroxide. This treatment has found to increase the solubility of organic materials. Sunflower stalk and head with higher lignin content of 10.48 % and 20.36 % respectively showed a decreased lignin content of 7.19 % and 18.74 % respectively after treatment with Sodium hydroxide [125]   Acid pretreatment Hydrolysis of hemicelluloses by disruption of Vander Waal forces, hydrogen and covalent bonds Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocelluloses is increased Lignin is not affected by acid pretreatment.

Graphical abstract       Biogas production by anaerobic digestion is a potential technique for waste management and reduce carbon footprint. Heat capacity and fuel efficiency of biogas make it as an interesting alternative to the depleting nonrenewable fuels. The full potential of anaerobic digestion is not realized yet due to operational difficulties, government policies and people acceptance. This review focuses on the bottle necks in the biogas production technology and highlights some of the recent technology that can be adopted to achieve circular economy in biogas sector. In a waste to energy perspective, the presence of recalcitrant lignocelluloses in the available biowaste is discussed. Various pretreatment techniques used to convert these recalcitrant materials to suit anaerobic digestion are compared. Microalgal culture techniques for waste treatment and biogas upgradation are seen as a promising strategy towards clean energy. In many cases the impurities present in the biogas limit its usage. Hence, more emphasis for biogas upgradation by adopting advanced methods like facilitated transport in a nanocellulose membrane is needed. Implementation of biogas as an alternative to fossil fuels has both technological and policy related barriers. Biogas helps to attain sustainability development goals proposed by the United Nations. This review discusses the technological aspects of biogas production alongside the application of biogas to attain sustainability in the fuel sector. In various sections, we highlight the technical difficulties in biogas production, solutions for those problems, and potential of biogas technology in achieving sustainable goals.

The demand for energy is growing globally due to growing population. Fossil fuels are exhaustive and can potentially damage the environment in plethora of ways. Biogas is one of the clean and economically viable solutions to the fuel problems currently faced by us [53] . Organic waste can be an-aerobically digested to produce biogas. Biogas consists of 50–75 % methane, 25–50 % carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and other gases like hydrogen sulphide (H2 S), ammonia, oxygen. The major constituent of biogas is methane and it can effectively replace fossil fuels in both heat and power generation. Further it can also be used as transportation fuel. Biogas production is a zero waste technology, as methane produced is used as fuel and the digested material or digestate is used as crop manure [45] . Organic matter rich agricultural waste, municipal waste and industrial waste are widely used for biogas production. Apart from this, energy crops like hemp can be added to increase methane yield [16] . Agricultural waste is the widely available organic substrate for biogas production. Globally 5.5 billion tons of agricultural waste is generated annually [27] , India and China are the highest contributors with 500 million tons [18] , and 860 million tons [10]  respectively. Municipal waste is constituted by food residues and household wastes. Globally, 1.3 billion tons of municipal waste is generated every year [12] . These are highly rich in organic content and possess greater methanogenic value. Industrial by-products, residues and waste are the components of industrial waste. Though industrial waste is rich in organic content, they have chemically unpredictable components. Chemical composition of the substrate is crucial in determining the quality and quantity of methane produced during anaerobic digestion. Salt tolerant halophyte plants are recently used for biogas production. Plants like Salicornia europaea , Tripolium pannonicum  etc are cultivalted in saline areas as a salt water treatment effort and also yield biomass that can be used in AD process [5,25] . [93]  identified cassava peels along with fruit and vegetable waste as an alternate biowaste to be used in places of South Africa with less cattle manure availability. AD is a microbiological process and hence the microorganism in the inoculum is a variable parameter in biogas production process. Genetically modified microorganism consortia are lining up to be used in AD process. In vitro  synthetic enzymatic pathway is one of the recent developments in strain development using molecular methods for enhanced biogas production [85] . Acclimatizing inoculums to the prevailing climatic condition of the region is another technique for efficient performance of AD process [56] . Biogas production process involves three stages viz pre-production stage (biomass selection, pretreatment and plant design), production stage (process parameters) and postproduction stage (upgradation techniques and marketing). Advancements in these areas will be discussed in upcoming sections of this review. Biogas composition greatly depends on the choice of feedstock, operational conditions and the type of plant used. Of these, feedstock availability is the main deciding parameter as the other two can be manipulated to a greater extent to get favorable results. Biogas contains impurities like nitrogen (upto 15 %), carbon monoxide (<0.6 %), oxygen (upto 3 %), ammonia, H2 S, siloxanes, hydrocarbons and water [108] . The presence of these impurities limits its application and decreases the heat content of biogas. Further, they also lead to pulmonary diseases in humans if left untreated before usage. H2 S is a potential nerve poison, and it can damage the environment by causing acid rain. Being a corrosive agent, H2 S can damage the pipelines and absorbents used [78] . Siloxanes are volatile silicon containing compounds which are deleterious to the equipment used in AD process. Ammonia is toxic to the anaerobic bacteria in the digester and when released it causes health problems to humans. Water scrubbing is a widely used technology for removing H2 S. The main purpose of biogas upgradation is to remove CO2  using various techniques like absorption and adsorption which are discussed later in this review. The biodegradability of the biowaste determines its potential to be used as feed for AD. The World energy council has predicted that more than 6 million tons of waste will be produced per day by 2025. This waste, when left untreated in a landfill, can contribute to greenhouse gases. Hence generation of energy from biowaste is needed to reduce the carbon footprint. Production of energy and value-added products from this waste can tackle waste related problems faced at present. Fig. 1   shows the global share of various biomass used for biogas production. Of these, using animal manure for biogas production results in socio- economic and environmental advantages by removal of pathogens, improved usage of animal manure as fertilizer, and more importantly production of green renewable fuel. The European renewable energy council has advised replacing 27–30 % of energy consumption with renewable sources by 2030. Biogas has the potential to help us achieve this target globally. This review paper is aimed to provide an insight into biogas production process, upgradation techniques and usage for microalgae for biogas upgradation. Further, application of facilitated transport of carbon dioxide for improving biogas quality and the role of biogas production towards attainment of sustainability development goals are discussed. This article is structured to address the major limitations in complete conversion of available biomass for biogas production. The advanced line of techniques involving nanocarbons for the degradation of lignocellulosic material are discussed in the later sections. Further, a comprehensive analysis on the impact of biogas usage in achieving sustainable goals is done. Conclusively, positive effects of biogas production and its usage as a replacement for conventional fuel systems on resource recuperation and the circular economy are discussed.  2 Biogas generation from lignocellulosic biowaste Agricultural wastes contain a substantial amount of lignocellulosic material which are a potential source for biogas production. Plant cells contain cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin components as their structural components. The ratio of these three chemical constituents may vary according to their type, age and other growing conditions. But a considerate quantity of plant biomass is of lignocellulosic type. This lignin can inhibit the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose, which are the prime source of energy for biogas producing microorganisms. 2.1 Sources and properties There is a disproportion between the available organic waste and biogas produced from it. The major reason for this scenario is the presence of recalcitrant and complex biomolecules like lignocellulose in organic waste. Energy crops are added to the waste as an approach to increase the number of biopolymers that can be easily digested by microbes during anaerobic digestion. However, the usage of agricultural land, water and other resources for the production of energy crops is debatable as it competes with food crop production. Hence effective utilization of lignocelluloses in the available bio-waste is needed to increase the methanogenic capacity of the AD process. Lignocellulose consists of lignin- a complex heterogenous phenolic polymer [96]  and cellulose cross linked by hemicellulose which is made of pentoses and hexoses. This structural complexity makes the cellulose and hemicelluloses inaccessible to microbes for hydrolysis during AD. Hydrolysis is the initial step in AD [29] . Microbial enzymes hydrolyse complex bio polymers like proteins, carbohydrates and fats are converted to simple monomers like amino acids, sugars and long chain fatty acids respectively. Generally, methanogenesis is the rate limiting step in the AD process [68] . This is due to the slow growth rates of methanogens. Further, acute changes in pH, temperatures and presence of inhibitors can affect the growth of methanogens. Under circumstances where the initial substrate is rich in lignocelluloses, the initial hydrolysis step turns out to be rate limiting. This can lead to the failure of the AD process. Table 1   presents lignin content in various feedstocks used for biogas production and the effect of pretreatment on methane yield. In this section, various sources of lignocellulosic material and their properties are discussed.  2.2 Process mechanics, biogas generation parameters, lignocellulosic bio-waste recalcitrance Operational parameters of biogas production include but not limited to feed stock, co digestion, pretreatment of feed stock, reactor parameters, pH, temperature and retention time [23] . Optimization of these parameters can result in increased methane production. A wide range of reactor designs are available to perform anaerobic digestion. The choice of reactor depends on the application and feed stock used. Anaerobic contact process, anaerobic membrane reactor, anaerobic sequencing batch reactor, batch system anaerobic reactor, continuous stirred tank reactor, granular sludge bed reactor, fixed bed reactors, plug flow reactor, tubular reactor are mostly used for the production of biogas and methane [92] . AD reactors can operate in batch or continuous mode. Continuous mode is highly preferred for its constant biogas supply potential. Fig. 2   shows that four steps of AD i.e., hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis occur at same point of time in single stage digesters. Single stage digesters are easy to set up and operate. But higher methane yield is obtainable from two or three stage digesters [82] . In two stage digesters, hydrolysis, acetogenesis and acidogenesis take place in the first digester. The contents from first digester are fed to second digester where methanogenesis occur. This accounts for the complexity associated with multi stage digesters. Irrespective of the number of digesters used, recirculating a part of effluent to the initial digester resulted in more process efficiency by retaining microbial content and increasing liquid retention time [21] . Right choice of inoculum, proper substrate inoculum ratio and appropriate temperature conditions are needed for a successful AD process. The type of inoculum used depends on the substrate composition. Very low substrate inoculum ratio potentially results in incomplete digestion, whereas a high substrate inoculum ratio leads to poor substrate utilization [124] . Based on the temperature employed, AD process is termed as psychrophilic, mesophilic, thermophilic or extremophiles. Under psychrophilic conditions, substrate degradation is slowed down owing to the fact that hydrolytic enzyme activity increases with increasing temperature to a certain extent. Methane production in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions are comparable. However, mesophilic condition is highly preferred over thermophilic as the later is unstable and energy intensive. Anaerobic digestion is favored in a pH range of 5.5 to 8.5. Methanogenic bacteria are highly sensitive to pH conditions under 6.3 and above 7.8. Improper metabolization of volatile fatty acids produced from acidogenesis step decrease the pH below 3. Similarly, accumulation of ammonium ions and cations like K+ , Cd2+  can lead to increased pH. Both these conditions will lead to AD process failure. pH fluctuations in the digester can be controlled manually by modifying operation parameters or by using automated pH controller. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) is the average time that the liquid phase of anaerobic digestion is retained in the digester. HRT is crucial to obtain stable and optimal performance of AD. HRT depends on the type of reactor, substrate used, and other operational parameters. HRT is a vital checkpoint to the growth of microbes. Retention time should be appropriate so that the number of dead microorganism at any given time is less than the amount of microorganism reproduced. HRT varying for different substrate is reported by many researchers. [86]  studied the effect of HRT on methane production in a mixture of olive mill wastewater, cheese whey and liquid cow manure as substrate in a two-stage continuous stirred tank reactor. Of the 5 HRTs used in the experiment (5, 3, 2, 1 and 0.75 days) 0.75 days for acidogenic reactor and 25 days for methanogenic reactor was reported to yield maximum methane. Further, they reported that a higher HRT for acidogenic reactor resulted in more volatile fatty acid production. This is due to the presence of more lipids in the substrate mixture they used. [43]  reported a stable biogas production rate after 44 days in a semi continuous aerobic digester with cow dung as substrate. In a study by [51] , retention time for methanogenic phase as low as 8 days was found to decrease the digestion stability of food waste. Organic loading rate (OLR) refers to the amount of substrate added to the digester per day per unit volume. OLR is inversely related to HRT and ideally a high operating OLR is preferred for greater AD efficiency. However, overloading the digester is reported to create process disturbances and leads to non-proportional growth of microorganisms in AD [84] . As mentioned in the previous section, various biomasses can be used for AD process. However, the physical and chemical properties of the biomass influence the microbial action in both positive and negative scales. Lipids and proteins have relatively higher methane production potential than cellulose and lignin [58] . Lipids get converted to Long Chain Fatty Acids (LCFA) quickly and are accumulated. This accumulated LCFA acts as process inhibitor in plethora of ways. LCFA potentially damages bacterial cell walls and renders nutrients unavailable for microbes to act upon. Further lipids at higher concentrations lead to foaming, sludge formation, clogging of pipes and pose many operational difficulties to the AD plant. Lignin on the other hand is recalcitrant to anaerobic digestion. Table 1  helps us to understand the ubiquitous nature of lignin in the wide range of substrate used in AD. Lignin is reported as the second most abundant source of carbon in plants next to cellulose [95] . Lignin is a non-carbohydrate hetero polymer formed as a result of oxidative polymerization of p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol [32]  and hence it cannot be used as a carbon source in anaerobic digester. Clostridium , Acitovibrio celluliticus , Staphylococcus , Bacteriodes are the major microbial communities acting on complex carbohydrates under anaerobic conditions. These microbes lack the enzymes required for lignin degradation. In lignocellulosic fraction of biomass, lignin is present in the outer layer while cellulose is present with in lignin shell. Hemicellulose is present within cellulose and between lignin-cellulose layers. Fig. 3   correspond that chemical composition of lignocelluloses along with the factors contributing for its recalcitrant nature. Ether bond is formed between lignin carbon and cellulose or hemicelluloses carbon. Glycosidic linkage is formed between lignin and cellulose molecules [47] . This structural and chemical complexity accounts for the recalcitrant nature of lignocelluloses.  2.3 Physical, biological, chemical, and oxidative lignocellulosic pre-treatments Pre-treatment is essential to release cellulose and hemicellulose from lignocelluloses by disrupting its structure. A careful choice of pre-treatment method is necessary to avoid any deleterious effect on the microbe in the digester. Current technologies available for treating lignocellulosic material for biogas production are classified into four types as physical [105] , chemical [100] , physiochemical [14]  and biological [110] . Further, combination of one or more technologies can be used to get better degradation of lignocelluloses materials. Table 2   presents data on different pretreatment technologies and their principle, effects and application for biogas production.   3 Enhanced biogas production by microalgal culture Microalgae treatment offers a viable solution to treat anaerobic sludge before using it for biogas production. Sludge consists of humic substances, ammonia, sulphide and heavy metals in considerable amounts. These can act as inhibitors of AD process particularly by negatively influencing methanogenesis [13,60] . Sludge contains a higher nitrogen content ranging from 5 to 9 % of dry weight [57] . Disposal of effluent from this sludge can pose a serious threat to the environment by causing eutrophication. Microalgae, when cultivated on nitrogen and humus rich sludge, grow profusely and accumulate more protein in its biomass. Further the collected microalgae can be co digested with the sludge. 3.1 Microalgae for treating anaerobic digestion sludge and improving biogas Anaerobic digestion of sludge from wastewater treatment plant is necessary to reduce the organic content of the sludge because the effluent from the treatment plant is released to the environment. Conventional sludge digestion process is energy intensive. However, it can be modified as a self-sustainable method by producing energy from the organic matter in the sludge. As discussed earlier, the components of sludge are not anaerobic digestion friendly. Microalgae based sludge treatment is a breakthrough in wastewater management efforts. [11]  studied microalgal production using secondary wastewater effluent and the subsequent production of methane by co digestion of microalgae with the sludge. Microalgae genus Chlorella  sp., Scenedesmus  sp. and Stigeoclonium  sp. were used in their study. The microalgae sp were cultured in a closed photobioreactor with an alternating dark light period of 12 h. The photobioreactor was operated in semi continuous mode with a HRT of 8 days. From the study, they found that nitrogen as ammonium ion was sequestered by microalgae and nitrate consumption happened after complete exhaustion of ammonium in wastewater. Scenedesmus  sp was profusely grown and resulted in 90 % and 87 % removal of ammonium ions and phosphate ions respectively. Methane production was 64 % higher in pretreated microalgae: sludge co digestion tank. However, methane yield was 50 % lesser in anaerobic digestion of untreated micro algae. [87]  chose Chlorella  sp microalgae to utilize sludge nutrients and reported a total nitrogen removal of 80–90 g Nitrogen/Kg of microalgae. Harvested Chlorella  was co digested with wastewater sludge in AD and resulted in 65–90 % specific methane production (mL methane/g/feed). Methane production was reported to increase with microalgae pretreatment before introducing into the AD system. The reject water from the process measured a very low transmittance of light and found suitable to be released into the environment. [97]  ran a pilot scale microalgae and primary sludge co-digestion unit for one year. They reported a high degree of sludge nutrient utilization and microalgal growth. The plant operated at 35 °C and HRT of 30 days resulted in a methane yield of 370 mL/g per feed.  3.2 Biogas upgrading techniques, microalgae culture, and sludge management With the increased environmental awareness, biogas is a widely accepted alternate and environmental friendly source of fuels. However, biogas produced using currently available technologies has impurities like CO2 , H2 S, N2  and O2 . Also biogas is saturated with water vapor. Collectively, these limit the application of the biogas produced. By adopting proper upgradation techniques, biogas remains a promising alternative to fossil fuels. Biogas upgradation refers to the separation of methane from other impurities mentioned above. The 100 % concentrated methane is termed biomethane and it can be used in gas distribution network. Adsorption and membrane separation are employed as mechanisms in the biogas upgrading process [38] . In absorption techniques, a gaseous phase is used as scrubber to absorb the impurities like CO2  and H2 S. Methane should not be absorbed by the scrubber. Hence, the scrubber should be carefully chosen to obtain higher solubility of the impurities. When raw biogas comes in contact with the scrubber phase, CO2  with higher solubility than methane is absorbed by the scrubber and removed in the liquid phase. Methane rich gas is collected at the end of the process. Based on the type and nature of scrubber used, absorption process can be classified into physical and chemical scrubbing. In physical absorption process, a chemically non-reactive scrubber is used. Water is the widely used scrubber in physical absorption process because of higher solubility of CO2  and H2 S than methane [49] . Raw biogas is introduced from the bottom of a column and water enters the column from top in a counter current fashion. Raw biogas is pressurized to around 9–12 bars at the entry point and the scrubber water can be reused. Compression of raw biogas and continuous circulation of water are energy consuming. Organic solvents like methanol or dimethyl ether of polyethylene glycol can be used instead of water as scrubber. Regeneration of spent scrubbers requires high temperature in case of organic scrubbing. Chemical absorption uses reactive compounds as scrubber. Generally amine based substances like monoehanolamine, diethanolamine, diglycolamine are used. CO2  molecules are captured efficiently because the amines have higher CO2  loading capacity. However, regeneration of absorbents is energy intensive as it involves breaking chemical bonds. [40]  constructed a pilot scale biogas upgradation plant using amine absorption unit combined with a gas steam boiler. Energy required for the boiler was produced from a small amount of biogas generated. Further they report amine absorption technique as highly effective with >99.5 % CO2  removal and 89 % methane recovery. Adsorption uses micro porous solid matrix on which the biogas impurities adhere or bind. It is a surface phenomenon demanding large surface area per unit mass of adsorbent used. Based on the nature of force involved, the process can be physisorption involving weak Vander Waal’s interaction or chemisorption involving strong chemical bonds. Adsorbent can be easily regenerated in physisorption by increasing or decreasing pressure. H2 S is removed by adsorption on inner surface of activated carbon. Another conventional method used Sodium Hydroxide washing. Iron oxide is also used as desulpherizing agent. H2 S is mostly precipitated in an aqueous metal solution. Pressure swing adsorption is the widely used adsorption technology that captures impurities based on molecular characteristics and its affinity for adsorbent used. PSA works on the basis that gas under high pressures is adsorbed on solid surfaces. When the pressure is decreased, adsorbed gas will be released. The choice of adsorbent is designed such that it has affinity for CO2 , H2 S, H2 O and other impurities in biogas. Methane continues to move up in the column filled with adsorbent and is collected at the top by reducing pressures. [103]  simulated a novel vaccum pressure swing adsorption technique for simultaneous removal of CO2  and N2  with zeolite as selective sorbent. They emphasize the selection of adsorbent and process configuration as crucial factors in biogas upgradation. Researchers are looking for better and effective options of adsorbents and the process conditions are determined by simulations in most cases [2,1,81] . Binders like aluminium oxide, silicon dioxide or clay are used to set the matrix into mold and to increase pores in adsorbents. [20]  synthesized binderless zeolite beads using Amberlite IRA-900 anion-exchange resin beads as a hard template. They showed a higher carbon dioxide to methane selectivity in a PSA column. [102]  investigated the absorbent potential of activated carbons from CO2  activation of maize cob waste. Activated carbon obtained from 3 h of CO2  activation possessed better textures favoring more selectivity towards CO2 . [42]  synthesized tetra ethylene pentamine impregnated polymer resin for CO2  absorption. They also studied the effect of temperature and flow rate on adsorption behaviors experimentally. In-situ  conversion of CO2  to methane in the digester itself is a promising approach in biogas upgradation. This method decreases the need to remove CO2  in raw biogas and also increase the amount of methane produced. External supply of hydrogen to the anaerobic bioreactor supports hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. [41]  used anaerobic membrane bioreactor in a semi batch mode. H2  was introduced as different equivalent concentrations to CO2 . When 11 equivalents of H2  gas were introduced, methane content was raised to 92 % and CO2  was effectively depleted. [37]  reported a novel AD coupled with bioelectrochemical system as a low energy requiring biogas upgradation technique. It is based on a concept of in-situ  utilization of CO2  by microbial community in AD. A stainless steel/carbon bicathode was used to create an alkaline condition in the digester by continuous proton consumption. CO2  is converted to bicarbonate under the alkaline conditions. The bicarbonate is reduced to methane by Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina  in the cathode biofilm. This technique resulted in an 82.3 % conversion of CO2  to methane. Recent development in biogas upgradation explores algae-based methods. [54,91]  Biogas upgradation using microalgae/algal – bacterial/algal –fungal system has emerged as cost effective and environment friendly alternatives. Algal- bacterial based methods resulted in simultaneous removal of CO2 and H2 S in a single step. Algae is engaged in fixing CO2  in the presence of sunlight and the sulphur oxidizing bacteria converts H2 S to SO4  ions using the oxygen produced by algal photosynthesis [72,101] . Using algal-bacteria consortia in a photobioreactor for upgrading biogas is mostly done outdoors [69–70,79] . Co-culture of microalgae and fungi is a most promising approach for wastewater treatment and biogas upgradation [112,123] . In a microalga-fungal system strigolactone or its analogue is used. Strigolactones are phytohormones which help fungi to germinate and assimilate the available nutrients. [114]  developed pellets from fungus Pleurotus geesteranus  and microalgae Chlorella vulgaris . Strigolactone analogue GR24 was used at a concentration of 10-9 M with a shaking speed of 160 rpm resulted in the formation of these pellets. 72.4 % of CO2  removal was obtained using them. (W. [121]  utilized Chlorella vulgaris  and Ganoderma lucidum  at different concentrations of GR24 in different combinations of re-blue light. They reported a GR24 concentration of 10-9  to 10-7  to be appropriate for better algal-fungal symbiont growth and ultimately resulted in higher removal of nutrient and CO2 . [24]  investigated simultaneous upgradation and purification of biogas slurry using three combinations viz., Pleurotus geesteranus , Ganoderma lucidum , and Pleurotus ostreatus  pelletized with Chlorella vulgaris . Of these combinations, chlorella vulgaris /Ganoderma lucidum  pellets resulted in maximal removal of CO2  (75.61 %), total nitrogen (86.24 %) and total phosphorus (86.74 %). Under a photoperiod of 14 h light/10 h dark conditions. Autotrophic microalgae increase oxygen concentration in upgraded biogas which limits its application. Higher O2  concentration also gives an explosion risk. [36]  developed an open trickling column which desorbed 54 % of O2  produced photo synthetically. Other challenges in using microalgae for biogas upgrading includes poor CO2  mass transfer, operational difficulties in controlling flow rates and pH and photo autotrophy affected by seasonal temperature and light. Despite various research on the usage of algae based system for biogas upgradation and sludge management, there are various factors that influence the growth and pollutant removal efficiencies. Factors such as intensity and wavelength of light source, CO2  concentration, initial COD, photoperiods and weather conditions are crucial for effective performance of these upgrading units.  3.3 Factors impacting system efficiency Microalgae cultivation in wastewater helps in wastewater remediation and also cut off the cost involved in the media requirements for its production. Nutritional requirement of microalgae is similar to that of higher plants but their growth rate is higher. Microalgae constituting less than one percentage of total plant biomass are capable of producing more than 75 % of total O2  required by living organisms. The biochemical composition of microalgae differs between species. In general, microalgae synthesize proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. C and N in the form of CO2 , HCO3 − , NH4 , NO3  or NO2  or as organic C/N are utilized. Phosphorus is used in the synthesis of lipids. Main factors affecting the production of microalgae are strain used, light intensity, concentration of CO2 , salinity, pH, temperature and the availability of other nutrients. Widely used species of microalgae in industrial process are Nannochloropsis  sp., Tetraselmis suecica, Anabaena cylindrical, Aphanizomenon flosaquae, Chlamydomonas rheinhardii, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Chlorella vulgaris, Dunaliella salina, Euglena gracilis, Porphyridium cruentum, Scenedesmus obliquus,  Spirogyra  sp., Arthrospira maxima, Spirulina platensis, Synechococcus  sp. Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlorella vulgaris, Blue-green algae, Coelastrum microporum, Chlamydomonas reinhardti  and Chlorella sp  are used in municipal wastewater treatment. Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella pyrenoidosa  and Spirulina platensis  are widely used in agricultural waste treatment. Chlorella  sp. and Scenedesmus  sp. are used to treat industrial waste. However, many research are focusing on isolating different microalgae from various sources. [119]  isolated five Scenedesmus  spp. and three Desmodesmus spp . which showed high growth rate in synthetic wastewater. [62]  and [26]  advocated for the use of locally isolated microalgae strain to obtain higher biomass productivity and waste removal. [26]  used Desmodesmus  sp. isolated from piggery wastewater to treat piggery waste. Despite the isolation and utilization of microalgae from source, careful strain selection and monitoring is essential as wastewater also contains pathogens that are harmful to microalgae growth. [72]  designed four operational parameters for a pilot digester to upgrade biogas using algal- bacterial consortia. The parameters were operation with and without greenhouse, NaHCO3  or Na2 CO3  supplementation. NaHCO3  and Na2 CO3  supplementation resulted in 90.4 ± 1.5 % and 91.2 ± 0.7 % of methane production respectively. Further CO2  removal was recorded to be 95.7 % and 97.6 % respectively. Tubular, flat or vertical column type photobioreactors are used for microalgae cultivation. Photobioreactors are made of glass or acrylic materials to enable the entry of sunlight and photosynthesis. With photobioreactors usage, evaporation losses are controlled and biomass can be used during night conditions also. Microalgae are photosynthetically active in the wavelength range of 400 nm–700 nm. But optimal light intensity is essential for higher productivity of microalgae [71] . Algal based sewage treatment can be integrated with algal bacterial anaerobic digestion [94] . This was followed by biogas upgradation in a photobioreactor. HRT was maintained as 4 days initially and then reduced to 2.5 days. Regardless of the HRT, 98.9 ± 1.1 % total organic carbon was removed. Further, 74.7 ± 3.0 % of CO2  and 99.0 ± 2.8 % H2 S removal was obtained during biogas upgradation in an absorption column. [7]  used a 132 L tubular photobioreactor to cultivate microalgal bacterial consortium from a domestic wastewater treatment plant. They used modified Brunner medium to study the influence of alkalinity and deprivation of nitrogen on biogas upgradation potential of the microalgal bacteria consortium. 12:12 h dark light period was followed. Cultivation medium was circulated at a liner velocity with which biogas was supplied con-currently. They reported an alkalinity of 1700 mg/L ensured more than 96 % pure methane. Nitrogen defiant cycles resulted in complete removal of H2 S and increased the carbohydrate content of biomass. Low microalgae diversity was observed as the cumulative effect of the experimental conditions. Control of pH under high biogas to digestate ratio (25:1 v/v) was crucial for biogas upgradation. Such higher ratios are needed for removal of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorous assimilation in microalgae [111] . Liquid recirculation rate to biogas rate (L/G) was reported as a deciding parameter in decreasing O2  content in upgraded biogas. Higher L/G rates were associated with complete oxidation of H2 S [36] .   4 Facilitated transport membranes Carbondioxide constitutes around 25–50 % of biogas depending on the operation conditions. CO2  is accountable for more than 77 % of greenhouse gas. Separation of CO2  from biogas is essential to increase the utilization of biogas. CO2  reduces the heating value of biogas and also increases carbon footprint. Raw biogas has a calorific value of 5000 K.Cal/m3  whereas upgraded biogas has calorific value around 8400 K.Cal/m3 . CO2  pass through a membrane following different mechanisms like Knudsen diffusion, molecular sieving, capillary condensation and facilitated transportation. Facilitated transport (FT) mechanisms have evolved as a promising approach for CO2  removal from biogas. FT across nanocellulose membranes is based on reversible chemical reactions between CO2  and carriers on reactive sites in the membrane. Methane being a non-reactive gas will pass through the membrane. CO2  is transported as carbamate or bicarbonate. Nanocellulose membranes have the advantage of high surface area for CO2  transportation and higher mechanical feasibility. These membranes are bio-degradable, low cost and readily available. Cellulose nano fibrils or cellulose nanocrystals are isolated from cellulose using mechanical methods like grinding, ultrasonication or homogenization at higher pressures [106] . Alternatively, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical is used to isolate carbon nanofibrils by oxidation of cellulose [15] . FT requires an aqueous medium and various operational parameters affect CO2  separation. Increasing temperature increases CO2  permeability through the membrane. CO2  reaction with the carrier is more favoured by increasing the relative humidity. Also membrane swells with increasing humidity thereby increasing the surface area available for CO2  transportation [118] . 4.1 Upgrading biogas technology with nanocellulose Cellulose based fibres (CNF) are used as low cost environment friendly adsorbents with the advantage of easily changing its property by chemical treatments. Such chemical changes lead to higher adsorption capacities. At nanoscale, these cellulose materials possess high specific surface area exposing more number of adsorption sites which were added during chemical treatments. Cellulose nanofibers: CNF possess both crystalline and amorphous structures. CNF has a diameter of 5 to 30 nm and several microns long. CNFs are produced mostly by mechanical disruption by homogenization, ultrafine grinding etc. Chemical methods have also been reported to produce CNF [76] . [46]  developed a novel phosphorylated CNC-PolyVinylAlcohol (PVA) nanocomposite for biogas upgradation. They found the membrane thickness to increase with higher concentration of phosphorylated CNF in the nanocomposite. CO2  separation is highly favored in nanocomposite with 1 % CNF in 2 % PVA. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) are crystalline needle shaped or whisker shaped with a 3–5 nm width and 50–500 nm length. CNC are produced by acid hydrolysis of cellulose. Amorphous region in cellulose are destroyed during acid hydrolysis. Acid hydrolysis of cellulose is performed using sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and phosphoric acid [74] . [88]  incorporated different concentrations of CNC in polyvinylamine to synthesize a nanocomposite for biogas upgradation. They found the crystallinity of membrane to increase with CNC concentration. However, the thickness of selective membrane increased from 1.5 µm to 2.16 µm with increasing concentration of CNC. Bacterial nano cellulose (BNC) is isolated from Komagataeibacter,  cultured in artificial media. Properties of BNC depend on the culture conditions [104] . Electrospun cellulose nanofibers (ECN) are formed by blending cellulose with other polymers. These are highly porous and adsorption sites can be easily added. ECN has a diameter of 5–100 nm and length greater than a micron [73] .  4.2 Improved transfer efficiency utilizing nanocellulose membrane technology Facilitated Transport Membrane (FTM) possesses the advantages of high selectivity and permeability in CO2  absorption. CO2  binds with the carriers selectively, whereas the non-reactive methane and N2  gas passes through the membrane by diffusion. CO2  is selectively transported as bicarbonate anion. But, carrier agent will be lost or deactivated as a result of degradation events. This limitation is overcome by fixing the carrier on a polymer backbone. Cellulose has linear structure with both crystalline and amorphous geometry. CNF formed from cellulose are hydrophilic with high swelling rates. Large numbers of hydroxyl groups are available on CNC surface. This helps in the modification of CNC structures chemically. Transfer efficiency is influenced by thickness of the selective layer, operation pressure and humidity. CO2  permeance increases linearly with increase in humidity and CO2  selectivity also follows the same trend. [33]  reported a higher selectivity of 174 for CO2 /N2  at a highest humidity operated. This is due to the fact that a higher degree of membrane swelling is achieved with high relative humidity. Good membrane swelling favors the movement of both CO2  and N2 , when the relative humidity is increased from 50 % to 92 %, CO2  permeance increased from 0.05 m3 (STP)/(m2 h bar) to 0.58 m3 (STP)/(m2 h bar). When membranes with thickness more than 2.5 µm are used, CO2 /N2  selectivity decline at high relative humidity around 90 %. This phenomenon is due to the loss of polymer structure due to over swelling. CO2  selectivity decreases with increasing feed pressure. [33]  reported that when the feed pressure is increased from 2 bar to 15 bar, CO2  selectivity decreases till 5 bar and the trend is relaxed with further increase in feed pressure resulting in a constant values. They also reported that the permeance of both CO2  and N2  decrease with increasing feed pressure. But both gases followed different trends leading to the clue that CO2  and N2 followed different transport mechanisms. At higher pressures, membranes are less swelled and hence resistance to diffusion is built.  4.3 Internal and external factors influencing the efficiency of carbon dioxide transfer Membrane selection is the key to obtaining high CO2  permeability and high selectivity for CO2 . [28]  developed a blend of hydrophilic Pebax 1657 with carbon nanocellulose to access CO2  permeability and selectivity under humid and dry conditions. A minimal 5 % carbon nanocellulose blend with Pebax 1657 resulted in 42 % increase in CO2  permeability and 18 % increase in selectivity. However, any further increase in Nanocellulose content resulted in self-assembly of the carbon nanocellulose in the Pebax matrix. Relative humidity and feed pressure are the highly influencing external variables affecting the facilitated transport of CO2 . [4]  prepared a polyvinyl matrix with cellulose nanocrystal as filler for high performance CO2  capture. The hydroxyl group on the CNC reducing end was replaced by amino group. They investigated the effect of feed pressure and concentration of amine CNC. When the feed pressure was increased from 5 bar to 15 bar, CO2  permeability was found to decrease by two folds.   5 Evaluation, obstacles, and principles for maximizing biogas's contribution to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs) Sustainable development aims to fulfill the needs of the present generation without affecting the resources for future generations. To achieve this, two essential concepts need to be addressed. The first one is to meet the needs of non-affordable communities and the second is to focus on the limitations of nature to meet present and future needs. Main obstacles in the path of sustainable development are political instability between nations, climate change and socio economic conditions of people. 17 goals and 169 targets were proposed as global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations general assembly. 1: No Poverty, 2: Zero Hunger, 3: Good Health and Well-being, 4: Quality Education, 5: Gender Equality, 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, 10: Reduced Inequality, 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, 13: Climate Action, 14: Life Below Water, 15: Life on Land, 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions, 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal. Of these, goal number 7 is directly linked to biogas production and expanding its usage in various sectors. Biogas production impacts 12 out of 17 SDGs. By focusing on biogas production, the renewable energy sector is encouraged which further reduces climate changes by improving waste management processes. Further more jobs and opportunities can be created. Biogas utilization in rural households is to be encouraged as an attempt for addressing energy poverty issues in developing nations [91,99] . 5.1 Biogas contributes to SDGs Biogas contributes towards environmental health by reducing greenhouse gas emission from landfills and indirectly helps in conservation of forest. It improves health and sanitation by providing clean energy and waste management. Primary residues from the agricultural waste can be converted to sustainable products like energy from biogas, fertilizer and so on. This utilization of primary residues reduces the dependence of human growth and economy on land and resources [50] . Biogas sector impacts SDG 2- zero hunger by the biogas digestate application to agricultural fields. This increases the productivity and nutritional value of cultivated crops and helping to address food security and malnutrition. Further, using slurry as biofertilizer cut the cost invested on chemical inputs for farming. Biogas contributes directly to the affordable and clean energy goal SDG 7 [65] . Biogas impacts environment by replacing fossil fuel dependent energy production. AD process generates considerable energy savings in rural sectors. Biogas sector has a tremendous impact on SDG 13- climate action. AD process converts CO2  to methane which is a potent greenhouse gas. Both CO2  and methane when released directly into the atmosphere, increases the greenhouse effects tremendously. Biogas reduces the dependency on wood fuels which ultimately reduces deforestation.  5.2 Challenges to achieving the SDGs via biogas production Biogas production through AD process is advantageous for sustainable energy and environment. High installation and maintenance cost has made the technology unadaptable for rural areas in developing countries. The cost involved in using fossil fuel is comparably lesser than with the biofuels [107] . Another constraint in the extension of biogas technology toward sustainability is the lack of expertise in construction and maintenance. Lack of proper management and knowledge dissemination has resulted in failure of biogas projects despite the subsidies provided by the government. Apart from this, operational constraints are still prevailing in the biogas production process. Another major barrier is the low cost of coal and other conventional fuels available in the market. Lack of social acceptance is also seen with greater regard in the choice of fuel. Leaving the technological barrier behind, one of the noteworthy barriers is the lack of appropriate business models to take the technology to people.  5.3 Indicators of biogas's progress toward the SDGs, including resource recuperation and the circular economy A more sustainable future relies mostly on a circular and bio-based economy. The circular economy targets closing flows throughout material life cycles by more recycle and reuse efforts. This ultimately results in increased sustainability. On the contrary, a linear system works by producing products, using them and ultimately creating waste after a period of time. In a circular economy, pollution and waste are not created and natural resources are maintained as such. Despite the advantages that circular economy possesses, transition from linear to circular economy requires a lot of effort from policy makers and public. The biogas sector combines products and services like biogas production, biogas for energy generation, waste and wastewater management through anaerobic digestion and usage of AD digestate as biofertilizer. Indirectly waste and wastewater management helps in hygiene management, rural area development and nutrient recycling. [117]  analyzed the biogas sector in Ethiopia where more than 90 % of population uses solid biomass for cooking. Hence, the biogas sector had a great scope of growth in Ethiopia with 14 million US dollars being invested every year in constructing biogas units. They further suggest that micro and macroeconomic contribution of biogas also relies on utilization of the slurry as fertilizer. Though biogas is a promising fuel production technology, developing countries are staged at the level of increased micro digesters usage in rural areas rather using them for industrial purposes and power generation. A total of 50 million micro digesters are running globally, whereas only 700,000 biogas plants are operating worldwide.   6 Future perspectives in biogas production Biogas is a promising alternative to fossil fuel but implementing its usage among population faces technological and marketing hurdles. Biomass and waste generated locally need to be channelized for biogas production to attain sustainability goals. Electricity produced using this clean technology should be connected to electricity grid and local use of biogas fuel should be encouraged. Greenhouse gas emission can be reduced greatly when biomethane produced is used as transportation fuel by replacing diesel/petrol. Biogas consists of considerable quantities of impurities which are hazardous to the environment and to human health. Considerable research is currently focusing on biogas upgradation techniques. Economic and up scaling feasibility of these techniques need to be studied further. Though biogas is acclaimed as clear energy, it also encompasses a risk of methane leakage which can effectively increase the greenhouse gases level. Methane leakage is influenced by structural and operational parameters. However there is a lack of precise and reproducible method to measure methane leakage in these plants. Development of an advanced and potential method to quantify methane leakage is a major research prospective. Biogas production technology is a potential research area where adoption of new technologies should be welcomed. This is partly to encourage the upscaling of biogas production units. Also a proper investigation into the social taboos in accepting biogas for household utilities and a much-needed insight for policy makers and investors to promote the setting of biogas plants globally is essential.  7 Conclusion Global energy crisis can be addressed by efficient harnessing of biogas potential. It helps in mitigation of greenhouse gas emission and reduce global carbon footprint. A conscientious usage of biogas for electricity production should be encouraged by government policies. This review has discussed the bottlenecks in biogas production process in technical and feasibility aspects. Also, optimal solutions to address these problems are discussed. As technology evolves, the human tendency to exploit those technologies for the betterment of global health should be appreciated. Artificial intelligence techniques can be adopted for research in these areas to reduce the cost involved and find solutions at a faster pace. [89]  Commercialization of various technologies used in biogas upgradation and efficient waste management is quintessential to elevate biogas availability in the market. In succinct, better energy and waste management policies by decision makers, employing advanced technologies for biogas production and upgradation and better marketing strategies for increased acceptance can make biogas a sustainable alternative for fossil fuels. Hence, we recommend adopting a holistic approach for complete exploitation of biogas potential by bridging the gap between theory and practice. This can turn biogas as a promising futuristic energy source and help mankind to achieve global sustainable goals.  CRediT authorship contribution statement K.
