                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations represent a crucial worldwide initiative aimed at advancing development and fostering a more favorable future. However, the advancement made towards achieving these objectives has been insufficient, and the allocation of research endeavors has been uneven. As a way to address this concern, the present study aimed to conduct an evaluation of the SDGs through examining their research-friendly characteristics. By conducting a systematic review of scholarly works and employing diverse evaluation criteria, the research employed a multi-criteria decision-making approach to rank the SDGs. The results of the study indicate that SDG 3, which pertains to health and well-being, was rated the most research-friendly, whereas SDG 4, which emphasizes quality education, and SDG 16, which concerns peace, justice, and strong institutions, received the lowest ratings. Besides, some of the research obstacles linked with every SDG have been outlined by this paper. The present investigation underscores the research-oriented character of the SDGs and emphasizes the significance of comprehending research agendas to formulate efficacious and sustainable resolutions to worldwide predicaments. The outcomes of this study offer a significant asset for individuals responsible for making decisions, the academic community, and other interested parties who are involved in the allocation of resources towards the SDGs. The current investigation provides an important contribution to the scholarly dialogue by creating a framework that can direct expected research efforts and aid policymakers in modifying existing or creating new goals that are more favorable to research and development.

However, the advancement made towards achieving these objectives has been insufficient, and the allocation of research endeavors has been uneven. As a way to address this concern, the present study aimed to conduct an evaluation of the SDGs through examining their research-friendly characteristics. By conducting a systematic review of scholarly works and employing diverse evaluation criteria, the research employed a multi-criteria decision-making approach to rank the SDGs. The results of the study indicate that SDG 3, which pertains to health and well-being, was rated the most research-friendly, whereas SDG 4, which emphasizes quality education, and SDG 16, which concerns peace, justice, and strong institutions, received the lowest ratings. Besides, some of the research obstacles linked with every SDG have been outlined by this paper. The present investigation underscores the research-oriented character of the SDGs and emphasizes the significance of comprehending research agendas to formulate efficacious and sustainable resolutions to worldwide predicaments. The outcomes of this study offer a significant asset for individuals responsible for making decisions, the academic community, and other interested parties who are involved in the allocation of resources towards the SDGs. The current investigation provides an important contribution to the scholarly dialogue by creating a framework that can direct expected research efforts and aid policymakers in modifying existing or creating new goals that are more favorable to research and development.   Keywords United nations 2030 agenda  Sustainable development goal (SDG)  Research-friendliness  Research obstacles   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were launched in 2015 by the United Nations as a global initiative aimed at eradicating poverty, safeguarding the environment, and promoting peace and prosperity for all by 2030, as outlined in the United Nations 2030 agenda (Ghosh and Chakravarty, 2024 ). Completing the 2030 agenda necessitates consistent progress in strengthening all SDGs (Lafont-Torio et al., 2024 ). The SDGs comprise a set of 17 objectives (as listed in Appendix A ) that seek to tackle the most urgent challenges facing the global community (Confraria et al., 2024 ). The SDGs recognize research and development as a transformative process that involves both collective and individual efforts. They acknowledge that successful global development initiatives are founded on thorough research and a comprehensive comprehension of the subject matter. Efforts have been undertaken to comprehend and employ the SDGs to develop initiatives that can effectively accomplish each goal (Bain et al., 2019 ; Chapman et al., 2020 ). According to literature (Leal Filho et al., 2023 ; Biermann et al., 2022 ; Chopra et al., 2022 ), there appears to be insufficient progress towards achieving the SDGs, and it is possible that the global community may not meet these targets by the projected year of 2030. A few scholars have contended that the global goals in question were inadequate in achieving the intended outcomes (Biermann et al., 2022 ; Huan et al., 2021 ). Given that the 2030 agenda for sustainable development has been operational for a significant duration, it is appropriate to conduct a mid-term evaluation to assess the efficacy of the established goals and determine the need for potential revisions. This study endeavors to fulfill this objective. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the research compatibility of the SDGs. This is because conducting research on the SDGs is crucial in establishing a scientific basis for the development and execution of policies and programs that can facilitate the attainment of these goals (Chapman et al., 2020 ). According to Leal Filho et al. (2018) , the presence of the SDGs provides a favorable circumstance to enhance sustainability research. Research endeavors can facilitate the identification of inadequacies and difficulties in the execution of the SDGs, as well as contribute to the formulation of inventive resolutions and optimal procedures (DÃ­az-LÃ³pez et al., 2021 ; Leal Filho et al., 2022 ). Moreover, scholarly inquiry can make a valuable contribution to gauging advancements towards the SDGs and facilitating the monitoring of the efficacy of interventions (Leal Filho et al., 2022 ). Scholars globally are addressing SDGs based on their respective areas of expertise and interests. Nonetheless, it is imperative to conduct research on SDG research to obtain a pragmatic understanding of the outcomes of these efforts (Allen et al., 2017 ; Leal Filho et al., 2019 , 2022 ). Although all SDGs are significant in their own regard, research has shown that there exists an uneven distribution of focus across the various goals (Biermann et al., 2022 ). While certain SDGs have been extensively researched, others have yet to receive the same level of attention (Meschede, 2020 ). Given the interconnectedness of the SDGs as evidenced by research (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ), it is imperative that researchers allocate their efforts more equitably to avoid an outcome that lacks relevance due to uneven effort. According to Asim et al. (2018)  and Schot and Steinmueller (2018) , a standard and comprehensive achievement of goals requires a normal distribution of research efforts. In order to achieve the 2030 agenda, a substantial investment in research and development will be required. The implementation of research findings can be facilitated through a multi-stakeholder strategy that involves the academic community, authorities, and individuals. In light of the present circumstances, it is imperative to encourage sustainable research, as emphasized by Leal Filho et al. (2018 , 2019 , 2022 ). A fundamental inquiry in the study of SDGs pertains to the degree of research feasibility associated with each of the 17 goals. The pertinence of this inquiry lies in its potential to steer the distribution of resources and establish priorities for research endeavors. One proposed approach for investigating research related to the SDGs is through academic publications, as suggested by Meschede (2020)  and Pizzi et al. (2020) . Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the degree of research friendliness of various United Nations SDGs by analyzing archived research outputs. The results of our study will furnish significant insights for the United Nations, academic researchers, policymakers, nations, and other relevant parties engaged in the formulation and execution of the SDGs. This will aid them in determining their priorities and efficiently allocating their resources. The concept of âresearch-friendlyâ goals is subject to varying interpretations, contingent upon the perspective of the defining party. As such, it is incumbent upon authors to establish their definition and positionality prior to commencing their research. Drawing from prior research conducted by Redner (1998)  and Jia et al. (2017) , it is posited that research-friendly topics are characterized by their ability to effectively garner research attention and collaborations, leading to productive collaborations, publications, and citations. Conversely, subjects that present challenges to research are those that exhibit a restricted range of research pursuits. This assertion can be corroborated by examining trends in scholarly inquiry, wherein specific subjects are observed to garner a significant amount of scholarly interest and investment, while others are comparatively neglected. This study evaluates the research-friendliness of various alternative SDGs based on seven criteria, namely total number of publications, publication growth over time, expected citations per publication, research-field diversity, international collaboration, academic-corporate collaboration, and field-weighted citation impact. The quantity of publications and its progression over time serve as clear indicators of the scholarly community's drive to conduct and disseminate research, as well as the evolution of this drive over time (Fire and Guestrin, 2019 ; Sorooshian, 2017 ). In addition, a significant number of scholars consider citation as a valuable measure of their scholarly output. Consequently, the anticipation of obtaining a specific quantity of citations per publication can act as an incentive to enhance research and publication endeavors (Fire and Guestrin, 2019 ). The article field-weighted citation impact is a novel metric that measures the citation count of a written work in relation to the average citation count of works within the same field, as per Nieuwenhuis (2022) . Additional factors that can be used to evaluate the degree of research friendliness encompass a range of aspects such as the variety of research domains, the extent of global cooperation, and the degree of academic-industry partnership. These factors can provide insight into the level of engagement in a particular subject matter by both the academic and industry sectors. In contemporary times, an increasing corpus of scholarly literature is surfacing across diverse academic disciplines that bear direct pertinence to the SDGs (Leal Filho et al., 2019 ). Academic literature emphasizes the necessity of conducting research on SDGs to fully grasp the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary aspects of sustainability research, as well as the geographical distribution of research interest. This viewpoint is supported by various scholars, including Bain et al. (2019) , Fire and Guestrin (2019) , Kwiek (2021) , Leal Filho et al. (2018) , and Leal Filho et al. (2019) . In essence, a crucial step towards addressing sustainability issues on our planet is to ascertain the research-friendly and less research-friendly SDGs in order to identify the underlying causes and rectify any imbalances. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study represents the initial endeavor to tackle the matter. Our research objective will be attained through the implementation of a systematic literature review. The proposed approach would facilitate a systematic and impartial evaluation of the research-friendliness of individual goals, utilizing multiple criteria. It is imperative to acknowledge that a thorough and multi-faceted evaluation of the research friendliness of each SDG necessitates the implementation of a systematic literature review and a standardized research friendliness measure. To support evidence-based policymaking, identify knowledge gaps, enhance accountability, promote collaboration, and foster growth in capacity, it is essential to assess the research-friendliness of the SDGs. The present endeavor aims to offer a more profound comprehension of the Agenda 2030's extensively researched goals and those that necessitate further attention. By systematically evaluating the research landscape within the context of sustainable development, stakeholders can utilize research to promote and drive progress toward achieving the SDGs, support transparency, facilitate informed decision-making, and ensure the cooperative generation of knowledge for a fairer, more resilient, and sustainable future (Azmat et al., 2023 ; Trane et al., 2023 ). Additionally, it would allow for the identification of any existing disparities within the current research environment. This also will be a crucial stride towards ensuring the efficient allocation of resources to accomplish the SDGs and promote a sustainable future. Moreover, this endeavor serves to advance global progress by discerning the degree of research receptivity associated with each SDG, thereby furnishing policymakers and researchers with a framework for allocating their resources more effectively. By prioritizing the SDGs that are most conducive to research and tackling the obstacles identified in the SDGs that are less research-friendly, advancements can be made in the pursuit of the SDGs and the promotion of sustainable development on a global scale. Furthermore, the results obtained from this research have the potential to serve as a fundamental framework for future modifications of the SDGs. The forthcoming section, Methods, will explicate the approach that was employed to conduct this investigation.  2 Method The objective of this investigation is to ascertain the most conducive United Nations SDG for research by scrutinizing the documented research accomplishments of each SDG. In order to attain the aforementioned objective, a methodical review of the Scopus database (www.scopus.com ) will be conducted. This database is recognized as one of the most extensive collections of scientific and scholarly articles, as noted by Sorooshian et al. (2023)  and Sorooshian et al., 2023b . Apart from the Scopus platform, the recently introduced metrics tool, Scopus' SciVal (www.scival.com ), has commenced offering supplementary indicators that are utilized to evaluate research outputs pertaining to SDGs. This research has utilized the pre-formulated standard browsing feature offered by the Scopus database's advanced search functionality for each of the SDGs, thereby availing an advantage. This search outcome was defined as all indexed publications between the years 2015 and 2022. As a result, the author gathered information pertaining to the quantity of publications, citations, and collaborative endeavors associated with each SDG. This study evaluates the research-friendliness of each SDG by utilizing predetermined evaluation criteria, based on the data obtained from the database. This study employs the Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method to systematically account for multiple criteria in addressing the intricate matter of research-friendliness. The EDAS was first introduced in 2015 (Keshavarz Ghorabaee et al., 2015 ) and quickly gained recognition (Torkayesh, et al., 2023 ). EDAS is a ranking method utilized in complex Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to prioritize a set of alternatives, specifically the SDGs in this research, need to be prioritized based on multiple criteria, such as research-friendliness criteria. The evaluation of alternatives in EDAS involves a two-phase approach that utilizes an average solution. This approach incorporates the average positive/negative distance and net distance between alternatives, as outlined by Shaaban and Abd (2020) . The resulting rankings are then used to assess the various alternatives in relation to the SDGs. The EDAS methodology comprises a series of eight steps as outlined by Keshavarz Ghorabaee et al. (2016) , Kahraman et al. (2017) , and Shaaban and Abd (2020) .1. The initial stage of the process involves the formulation of a decision. The initial stage of utilizing EDAS involves precisely outlining the problem of decision-making that necessitates our attention. The process entails the identification of the decision objective, the available decision alternatives, and the criteria employed to assess these alternatives.  2. The second step involves the creation of a decision matrix, which is a matrix with dimensions of m  Ã n  (where m  represents the number of alternatives and n  represents the number of criteria) that assesses and compares the alternatives based on each criterion. The matrix ought to be completed with pertinent data for every alternative, utilizing the criteria established in the initial step. Each cell X ij   in the matrix denotes the degree of satisfaction of the i th option with respect to the j th criterion. Correspondingly, a decision matrix with n (n  = 1, 2, â¦, j)  criteria and m alternatives (m  = 1, 2, â¦, i)  is represented with equation (1) .   (1) [ X 11   X 12   â¦  X 1 m    X 21   X 22   â¦  X 2 m    .  .  â¦  .   .  .  â¦  .   .  .  â¦  .   X n 1   X n 2   â¦  X n m     ]     3. Step three involves the computation of the average solution (AV). The process entails determining the mean value of each criterion for all available alternatives. AV of each criterion j  is illustrated in equation (2) .   (2) A V  j  = ( â i = 1  n  X i j    )  / n     4. The fourth step entails the calculation of the deviation from the AV for each alternative utilizing equations (3) and (4 ). In the context of research-friendliness, these equations determine the distance between each SDG and the AV.   (3) P o s i t i v e  d i s t a n c e  f r o m  a v e r a g e  ( P D A  )  = [ PDA ij  ]  n Ã m    w h e r e  PDA i j   = max ( 0 , ( X i j    â  AV j   )   )   /  AV j      (4) N e g a t i v e  d i s t a n c e  f r o m  a v e r a g e  ( N D A  )  = [ NDA ij  ]  n Ã m    w h e r e  NDA ij  = max ( 0 , ( AV j   â  X ij   )   )   /  AV j      5. Step five involves equations (5)â(7 ) to compute the aggregate of anticipated benefits (or positive distance from average solution (SP )) and anticipated costs (or negative distance from average solution (SN )) for each alternative by applying weights of each decision criterion.   (5) W j  = weight  of  j th  criterion     (6) S P i  = â j = 1  m  W j  P D A i j       (7) S N i  = â j = 1  m  W j  N D A i j       6. The sixth step pertains to normalization, wherein equations (8) and (9 ) are utilized to normalize the SP and SN values of all alternatives.   (8) N S P i  = S P i  /   max i  ( S P i   )      (9) N S N i  = 1 â S N  i  /     max i  ( S N  i  )      7. The seventh step involves the determination of the appraisal score. Determine the appraisal score (AS ) for all feasible alternatives by utilizing equation (10) .   (10) A S i  = ( N S P i  + N S N i   )   / 2  w h e r e  0 â¤ A S i  â¤ 1     8. Finally, the last step involves the process of ranking alternatives according to their respective AS  values, where the alternatives with higher AS scores are considered superior.    To address limitation of the method, some researchers suggest that EDAS would be more reliable is it deals with uncertainties of complex problems, so they upgrade the method with utilizing uncertainty sets (Ghorabaee et al., 2016 ; Kahraman et al., 2017 ; Kutlu GÃ¼ndoÄdu et al., 2018 ); this paper, however, utilized archived data from the Scopus database, ensuring that our data-driven decision-making are free from uncertain inputs. As a result, employing a systematic data-driven approach and utilizing the EDAS MCDM methodology, this research endeavor aims to establish a fundamental basis for forthcoming investigations on SDGs. The objective is to build upon the current discoveries and enhance the precision and resilience of the outcomes. Additionally, ancillary information pertaining to this investigation was gathered from February 4th to February 8th, 2023, utilizing the chat feature of the artificial intelligence platform, ChatGPT (https://chatgptonline.net/ ) robot. The ChatGPT is a sophisticated language model that utilizes a wide array of sources up to the year 2021 to produce responses that resemble human-like interactions with users. Interviewing this robot has been used in previous investigations, such as in studies by Mann (2023) , Iskender (2023)  and Lund and Wang (2023) . The robot's chat function, thus, employed to gather the robot output entailed posing the following query: What are the primary obstacles, restrictions, and impediments identified by researchers and scholars in their efforts to tackle SDG number i ? Here, i  corresponds to each of the 17 SDG alternatives. Subsequently, the amassed data was scrutinized and condensed to address the research inquiry regarding the primary obstacles encountered by researchers and scholars in tackling each of the SDGs. One of the benefits of utilizing ChatGPT is its capacity to handle large volumes of data and furnish prompt and exhaustive replies, a feat that may not be achievable through manual means (Mann, 2023 ). Moreover, the ChatGPT platform obviates the possible prejudices and constraints that could ensue from soliciting input from individuals and scholars, given that the outputs are produced on the basis of the existing data and do not mirror the subjective viewpoints or encounters of the participants. The utilization of a diverse range of sources in this approach results in a more comprehensive and objective representation of the challenges, limitations, and barriers associated with each SDG. Meanwhile, two sustainability researchers have been asked to provide feedback on the ChatGPT responses. The aforementioned data collection technique, in conjunction with its output verification phase, furnishes significant perspectives for scholars, decision-makers, and interested parties involved in the execution of the SDGs.  3 Results Scopus has reported that the quantification of SDG 17 poses a challenge, and as a result, a satisfactory search formula to accurately characterize it is currently unavailable. Consequently, due to insufficient data, this goal was excluded from the SDGs. The Scopus standardized search formulas were applied to the remaining 16 SDGs, and the resulting data were integrated into the investigation. The data presented indicates that a diverse range of research fields have been engaged in SDG research; a comprehensive depiction of this information is provided in Appendix B . Moreover, the trend of publications based on the Scopus archive has been normalized and is illustrated in Fig. 1  , which demonstrates a comparable upward trend in publications pertaining to all 16 SDGs. The graphical representation illustrates that SDG 12 exhibits the most substantial increase, while SDGs 3 and 16 demonstrate the most modest growth over a given period. The decision matrix for the evaluation of the EDAS system incorporates various metrics, including the total number of publications from 2015 to 2022, a visual representation of research field diversity, the average number of citations per publication, the field-weighted citation impact, an index to assess international researcher collaboration, and an index to measure academic-corporate collaboration. These metrics and the collected data are presented in Table 1  . The researcher presents field diversity values through a visual assessment of the data pertaining to each SDG. Additionally, publication growth is determined by applying equation (11)  where it normalizes the quantity of publications available in the database's archive.(11) Publication  growth = t o t a l  2022  P u b l i c a t i o n s  â  t o t a l  2015  P u b l i c a t i o n s  t o t a l  2022  P u b l i c a t i o n s        Table 2   displays the outcome of the comparison between all SDGs following the EDAS calculation steps. The subsequent Fig. 2   presents a comparative analysis of AS i  s, highlighting their equitable research-friendliness towards the SDGs. The visual representation portrays SDGs that are conducive to research through the use of a lighter hue, while those that are less conducive to research are depicted in a darker hue. The third SDG exhibits a higher degree of research feasibility in comparison to SDGs 4 and 16, which are comparatively less conducive to research. However, an absence of empirical evidence precludes the provision of any commentary pertaining to SDG 17Â at this juncture. The present study offers a unique contribution to the field of sustainability by utilizing a MCDM approach to evaluate the research friendliness of each SDG. This analysis introduces a novel approach by utilizing multiple criteria to evaluate the degree of research friendliness, leading to a more comprehensive and impartial evaluation of each SDG. The utilization of MCDM provides a systematic approach for the collection and analysis of data, which enables the detection of deficiencies and issues (dos Santos GonÃ§alves and Campos, 2022 ) in SDG research that may be disregarded by human cognition. This study highlights the significance of employing objective and systematic approaches to evaluate research friendliness in the context of sustainable development. Still, further investigation is needed to understand why certain SDGs were deemed more research-friendly than others. The distinctive characteristics and time-critical aspect of each SDG are crucial factors to consider. More importantly, how to balance the research efforts is another question. The ChatGPT's text-mining analysis, however, has revealed some of the presence of challenges and limitations in the research process for SDGs in general. The points presented may differ depending on the objective, however, they frequently encompass the subsequent elements.â¢ Limitations in data availability and quality, particularly in low-income countries.  â¢ Challenges in measuring progress and impact towards the SDGs as existing studies focus on specific aspects of the goals.  â¢ Lack of data and research infrastructure to effectively measure and monitor progress towards the SDGs.  â¢ Need for interdisciplinary research to address complex and interrelated issues.  â¢ Need for international cooperation and coordination to promote progress towards the SDGs.  â¢ Lack of standard measures and indicators to measure progress towards the SDGs.  â¢ Limited funding available for research and reluctance from countries to invest in necessary infrastructure.  â¢ Political, economic, and cultural difference or barriers to implementing effective solutions.  â¢ Limited collaboration and coordination of research efforts.  â¢ Lack of standardization in the recording, sharing, collection, analysis, and dissemination of data    The outcomes derived from the information acquired through ChatGPT serve to enhance the understanding and implementation of SDGs by offering valuable perspectives on the primary obstacles, restrictions, and impediments identified by researchers and experts in their efforts to tackle each of the SDGs. The aforementioned data can be utilized to apprise policy formulation and decision-making processes, as well as to allocate resources and endeavors in a manner that prioritizes the attainment of the SDGs. In addition to concurring with the aforementioned research challenges, the two invited researchers have emphasized the pressing need for further research on the SDGs as the deadline for their achievement approaches. They have noted that, a comprehensive understanding of the interdependent nature of the SDGs and their potential consequences is imperative, given their intricate and interconnected nature. The adoption of evidence-based policy making is a crucial factor in the pursuit of sustainable development. Machin and Liu (2024)  highlight the numerous criticisms and obstacles hindering the effectiveness of the SDGs. The SDG documents are criticized for their ambiguity due to the use of conflicting concepts, technical terminology, and vague definitions. The absence of clarity hinders comprehension and impedes collaboration towards achieving the objectives. The universal scope of the SDGs is a commendable objective, but it may inadvertently promote ethnocentrism and fragmentation instead of directly addressing the root causes of global issues. Studying the characteristics of each SDG and their connection to research priorities is important for comprehending why some were considered more conducive to research than others. For the time being, however, it is more crucial to minimize research obstacles and optimize the research outputs. Significant research initiatives advancing the SDGs often face challenges related to the availability and quality of data. To ensure dependable monitoring and informed decision-making, it is essential to allocate resources towards robust data infrastructure and capacity-building initiatives. Raising awareness of challenges and enhancing data collection methodologies and quality standards enable better evaluation of SDG outcomes and resource allocation. The United Nations' allocation of resources towards data collection and measurement has also the potential to facilitate research pertaining to the SDGs. Moreover, essential strategies for overcoming research challenges involve promoting information exchange and cultivating collaboration among diverse disciplines. Collaborative projects frequently face societal, institutional, and political obstacles, necessitating proactive measures to overcome them. Addressing the challenges of achieving diversity, inclusion, and interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for solving complex global issues. Besides, financial support and other resources are crucial in influencing the extent of research. Resource mobilization is essential for advancing research efforts, as some SDGs with specific financial backing or established funding pathways tend to attract more research support than others. The complexity and measurable aspects of each SDG are factors that influence research engagement. Simpler and quantifiable goals are more likely to attract funding and researcher attention compared to complex and challenging-to-measure goals. The level of political determination and global consensus on each SDG also greatly influences the advancement of research. Governmental bodies, non-governmental organizations, and civil society organizations are more inclined to provide funding and backing for research that aligns with their shared objectives. Research could be hindered if politically contentious or globally divisive SDGs encounter resistance. Interdisciplinary collaboration, knowledge-sharing platforms, and cross-sector partnerships are crucial for fostering a conducive environment for SDG research. The United Nations has the potential to significantly contribute to the progression of SDG research. Standardizing the gauges for research congeniality in the realm of sustainability would facilitate the elimination of obstacles to SDG research and foster data-oriented approaches to accomplish the goals. Likewise, this paper underscores the importance of interdisciplinary studies, which can be fostered through partnerships between academics and practitioners. The establishment of partnerships between diverse entities, including governmental bodies, commercial enterprises, regulatory agencies, and educational establishments, can facilitate the investigation of topics that hold significance for multiple stakeholders. Furthermore, the research policy has the potential to offer training and enhance the capabilities of SDG researchers, implementers, and monitors, thereby ensuring that proficient individuals provide support for SDG research and implementation. To advance SDGs, stakeholders and policymakers must be presented with specific examples of overcoming challenges and practical recommendations for implementation. To address resource limitations and enhance collaboration towards achieving the SDGs, advocating for innovative financing mechanisms tailored to address research gaps and bolster capacity building is crucial. To achieve the ambitious goals of the SDGs, thus, it is crucial to continue enhancing comprehension, advocating for evidence-based research policy, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.  4 Conclusion Still research on SDG research is at an early stage (Lafont-Torio et al., 2024 ); and it is motivating the present investigation to evaluate the degree of research-friendliness of each SDG. This work allows for objective comparison and so identification of strengths and weaknesses among the goals, guiding resource allocation and research agendas. It enhances the effectiveness of research and development efforts towards the SDGs, contributing to global sustainable development outcomes. The results of our study indicate that SDG3, which pertains to Good Health and Well-being, was the most conducive to research, whereas SDG4, which concerns Quality Education, and SDG16, which pertains to Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, were found to be the least research-friendly. The present research makes a noteworthy contribution to the domain of sustainability by offering an impartial evaluation of the research friendliness of each SDG. This underscores the significance of considering research friendliness as a crucial factor while determining the priority of initiatives aimed at tackling the SDGs. The importance of conducting research on all SDGs cannot be overemphasized. The significance of SDG4 lies in its emphasis on the promotion of lifelong learning and inclusive, equitable education as a fundamental right and a driving force for both individual and societal progress (Hanemann, 2019 ). Education provides individuals with the necessary knowledge, competencies, and principles to make meaningful contributions to society, eradicate poverty, enhance health outcomes, and expedite economic advancement. The significance of SDG16 lies in its advocacy for the establishment of harmonious and comprehensive communities, equitable dispensation of justice, and proficient, responsible, and comprehensive organizations across all tiers (YÄ±lmaz FÄ±ndÄ±k and ErÃ§etin, 2023 ). The achievement of sustainable development is contingent upon the establishment of peaceful and just societies, thereby underscoring the significance of comprehensively examining the 16th SDG. The significance of performing a systematic literature analysis and creating uniform metrics for investigating the amicability of research in the realm of sustainability is underscored by our investigation. Subsequent investigations may evaluate the degree of research receptivity of individual SDGs over a period of time, taking into account variables such as the perceived significance or pertinence of the subject matter, as well as the accessibility of financial or other resources. Mitigating these constraints would facilitate a more comprehensive comprehension of the SDGs and promote the research program for global development. This paper concludes that improved research policies and implementation of data-driven approaches are required. Remove research barriers and advance SDGs research to accomplish these goals. The statement underscores the significance of factoring in research friendliness as a key criterion in determining the allocation of resources and motives. Stakeholders engaged in SDG research, should undergo suitable capacity building for supporting SDG research. Furthermore, this paper highlights the necessity of conducting further research to expand on our discoveries and assess the research friendliness of forthcoming SDGs. Through the adoption of our proposed measures, policymakers and scholars can make well-informed choices and allocate resources effectively towards attaining the SDGs, ultimately leading to a more sustainable future for the global community. Although this paper has revealed the research-friendliness of each SDG, there are still many potential areas for future research. Firstly, it is worth considering performing longitudinal analyses to track changes in research engagement over time. This study has the potential to offer valuable insights into upcoming priorities and trends. Qualitative investigations involving stakeholders can provide a better understanding of the contextual factors influencing research engagement. Future research could be enhanced by utilizing interdisciplinary approaches, analyzing policy frameworks, and conducting cross-national comparisons to improve our understanding and facilitate efforts to boost research participation and achieve sustainable development. Finally, we can assess the effectiveness of research engagement in advancing tangible progress towards the SDGs by analyzing the outcomes of research investments and capacity-building efforts. By focusing on these areas, future research can gain a deeper understanding of sustainability challenges and develop strategies to accomplish the SDGs by 2030. Moreover, for future research, it is crucial to explore different methods for measuring SDG17 due to the difficulty caused by data constraints. Employing various data sources or methodologies to document the findings of research related to SDG17 is a potential solution. SDG17 focuses on promoting partnerships for achieving the goals, and case studies along with qualitative research methods can provide insights into this endeavour. Consulting stakeholders and subject-matter experts can provide a more comprehensive understanding of research involvement in SDG17, beyond just quantitative data analysis. The study can offer practical recommendations by discussing strategies to fill data gaps and ensure all SDGs are adequately represented in research evaluations. The procedure used in this paper can also possess some shortcomings despite providing a systematic approach to assessing research friendliness. Bias may be present as this paper solely employed Scopus data. The MCDM method is based on predetermined criteria for evaluating research-friendliness, which may overlook specific complexities or contextual factors that affect the research-friendliness of each SDG. Consequently, more research is needed to obtain every important detail for the global sustainability initiative.  Funding None.
