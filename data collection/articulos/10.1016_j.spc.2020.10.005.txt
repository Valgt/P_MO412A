                  The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are an interconnected strategy for the promotion of sustainable practices and solutions that addresses the main issues faced by our society. Concomitantly, two emerging topics are currently gaining interest due to their potential to implement systematic shifts and contribute to achieving the SDG – Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0). This research performed a systematic literature review to identify how the CE-I4.0 nexus, the combination of CE practices and I4.0 technologies, could contribute to achieving the SDG. A total of 50 peer-review articles that addressed the simultaneous or individual link between CE and I4.0 to sustainability form the review portfolio. The articles were first screened with regard to the I4.0 technologies and CE practices applied, and further analyzed in order to understand the stronger links to the SDG. Findings show that the CE-I4.0 nexus directly benefits SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, and SDG 13. The specific targets addressed by the combined implementation of CE practices and I4.0 technologies are disclosed and discussed. We argue that the CE-I4.0 nexus is pivotal in the endeavors to reach the SDG, as it connects innovative technologies with novel circular production and business models, which ultimately brings the opportunity to tackle the SDG targets intensified in this study. Further research could quantitatively address the impacts of the CE-I4.0 nexus, investigate secondary effects on the SDG, or develop further case studies under the CE-I4.0 umbrella.

Editor: Prof. Ioannis Nikolaou The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are an interconnected strategy for the promotion of sustainable practices and solutions that addresses the main issues faced by our society. Concomitantly, two emerging topics are currently gaining interest due to their potential to implement systematic shifts and contribute to achieving the SDG – Circular Economy (CE) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0). This research performed a systematic literature review to identify how the CE-I4.0 nexus, the combination of CE practices and I4.0 technologies, could contribute to achieving the SDG. A total of 50 peer-review articles that addressed the simultaneous or individual link between CE and I4.0 to sustainability form the review portfolio. The articles were first screened with regard to the I4.0 technologies and CE practices applied, and further analyzed in order to understand the stronger links to the SDG. Findings show that the CE-I4.0 nexus directly benefits SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, and SDG 13. The specific targets addressed by the combined implementation of CE practices and I4.0 technologies are disclosed and discussed. We argue that the CE-I4.0 nexus is pivotal in the endeavors to reach the SDG, as it connects innovative technologies with novel circular production and business models, which ultimately brings the opportunity to tackle the SDG targets intensified in this study. Further research could quantitatively address the impacts of the CE-I4.0 nexus, investigate secondary effects on the SDG, or develop further case studies under the CE-I4.0 umbrella.

This movement was intensified due to the global commitments directed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, addressing resource scarcity, and rethinking waste management (EMF, 2015 ; Nerini et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). Additionally, international agreements and policies are demanding sustainability-related initiatives as prerequisite for contracts, turning the adherence to sustainable initiatives into a market advantage (EC, 2015 ; Filippini et al., 2019 ; Ruiz, 2020 ). According to Rashed and Shah (2020) , businesses are critical stakeholders capable of accelerating the implementation of sustainable practices described in the United Nations Agenda 2030 (UN, 2015 ). The private sector's contribution to the Agenda is often related to innovation, trained personnel and responsiveness. However, research shows that private engagement provides win-win situations for their own business, society, and the environment (Scheyvens et al., 2016 ). In this context, the search for pathways to promote sustainability through private business models led industries to abandon the classic methods of production and turn to new market demands such as the use of innovative technologies to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) (Nerini et al., 2019 ) (Table 1  ). This global initiative recognizes the interrelated nature of issues such as poverty, inequality, gender equality and conservation (Le Blanc, 2015 ), as well as the necessity for cross-sectorial and intergovernmental cooperation towards systemic change (Salvia et al., al.,2019 ). Thus, it can be argued that the 169 targets that compose the SDGs form a “blueprint” to guide decision makers towards sustainable strategies (for the full list of SDG targets, please refer to Supplementary Material). According to Silvestre and Ţîrcă (2019) , sustainable performance cannot be achieved without innovations. Technological progress and innovation result in transformations ranging from the individual sphere to whole supply chains and communities. In this setting, cutting-edge technologies embedded in the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) context may drive development towards the achievement of the SDG targets, especially regarding the industrial sector (Hidayatno et al., 2019 ). Likewise, the new possibilities unlocked by the I4.0 technologies can leverage the Circular Economy (CE) and help address several SDG targets (Schroeder et al., 2019 ). The term I4.0 refers to a radical disruption towards an intelligent industry with autonomous and interconnected manufacturing technologies (Bai et al., 2020 ). According to Drath and Horch (2014) , the purpose of I4.0 is to connect the industry to the internet, turning factories more economical, smart, and efficient. It is believed that this new technological scenario will revolutionize the current industrial modus operandi  (Ramakrishna et al., 2020 ), and possibly will affect all sectors by transforming the design, operations and transportation of products and materials (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017 ). I4.0 describes the use of integrative and interconnected technologies for production optimization (Wan et al., 2016 ), for example: Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data (BD), Additive Manufacturing (AM), and Internet of Services (IoS) (Berawi, 2019 ; Ramakrishna et al., 2020 ; Wang et al., 2017 ). Other advanced technologies encompassed by I4.0 are Cloud Computing (CC), Augmented Reality (AR), Sytems Integration, Simulation, Cybersecurity, and Autonomous Robots (Lu, 2017 ; Zhong et al., 2017 ). According to Kagermann et al. (2013) , this new concept is the result of the combination of distinguished technological pillars, which later were structured by Rüssmann et al. (2015)  and here illustrated in Fig. 1  . These nine technological pillars are the basis for the development of new interconnections technologies. They can be applied individually, but when they are implemented simultaneously I4.0 shows the true potential, resulting in cutting-edge technological solutions based on data collection and intelligent manufacturing processes (Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017 ), i.e. Radio-frequency Identification (RFID), Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Data Driven Analytics (DDA). However, these technologies not only beneficial due to their manufacturing advantages, but also because they can be used to reduce waste generation, minimize environmental impacts, and help push industrial development to cleaner production processes (Halse and Jæger, 2019 ; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018 ; Yadav et al., 2020 ). After all, sustainable development relies deeply on its relationship with technological development (Bashtannyk et al., 2020 ). From this perspective, the development of I4.0 can drive a new type of progress that excels at resource optimization, waste management and other sustainable practices (Machado et al., 2020 ), topics vastly addressed in the Agenda 2030. However, investing in technology is not enough to achieve the SDG (Rashed and Shah, 2020 ). According to Bashtannyk et al. (2020) , a single focus on technology development may lead to industrial growth, but at the same time, can increase greenhouse gas emissions and further diminish the availability of natural resources (Lieder and Rashid, 2016 ). Thus, new technologies and practices should be used in line with other initiatives to fetch the SDG, such as the rising CE. CE is a concept that describes the paradigm shift regarding the use and disposal of materials and resources. It fundamentally opposes the production and consumption behaviors and patterns that our society is embedded in (EMF, 2015 ). The current system is based on the linear rationale that sustained global industrial development in the last decades (de Souza Junior et al., 2020 ; Stahel, 2007 ). This way of thinking is grounded on the large-scale use of extraction, use, and disposal of materials, which is the root to various intergenerational and intergovernmental issues, like waste disposal in natural areas, resource scarcity, and climate change (EMF, 2019 ; Korhonen et al., 2018 ). Contrary to this unsustainable system, CE proposes an innovative pathway to sustainable development by introducing a different way of perceiving value in the handling of natural resources (Kirchherr and Piscicelli, 2019 ). Although CE has recently become an emerging topic, its dissemination is hampered due to the diffusion of concepts and proposals for its evaluation (Kalmykova et al., 2018 ; Kirchherr et al., 2017 ). Despite the lack of an unified concept, different authors converge by addressing it as a systematic shift to an economic feasible, but yet regenerative model, grounded in the reinsertion of used resources through material cycles (technological and biological) (EMF, 2015 ; Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 ; Ghisellini et al., 2016 ). The CE would promotes the minimization of resource consumption, waste generation, and emissions, while still ensuring socioeconomic development (Ghisellini et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, Lieder and Rashid (2016)  pointed out that the three main topics related to CE are resource scarcity, environmental impacts, and economic benefits – areas that directly relate productive activities to current environmental issues, and were previously addressed under the sustainable development flag. This new model aims to minimize waste generation, resource consumption and other environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of services and products while still ensuring socioeconomic development (Ghisellini et al., 2018 ; Murray et al., 2017 ). In such a way, CE is developed around the idea of a system-wide change directly linked to resource extraction, waste generation, product design, environmental consciousness, innovative business models, and integrative policies (Bocken et al., 2017 ; Kalmykova et al., 2018 ; Korhonen et al., 2018 ). The development of new cutting-edge technologies, as proposed by I4.0, presents new opportunities for closing production cycles, maximizing the use of already applied resources, and therefore minimize extraction of raw material (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2018 ; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018 ; Pham et al., 2019 ). Therefore the exploration of the convergence points between these two themes through a sustainability-focused lens shows great relevance not only to the academic community, but also for decision and policy-makers. The convergence and combination between the I4.0 and circular systems, hereby referred to as CE-I4.0 nexus , is a current emerging topic in the scientific literature (Garcia-Muiña et al., 2018 ; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018 ; Pham et al., 2019 ). Dev et al. (2020)  analyzed the potential of implementing I4.0 tools in order to increase the performance of the reverse supply chain. Belaud et al. (2019)  addressed the benefits brought by BD implementation on agricultural supply chains. Chiappetta Jabbour et al. (2020)  and Pham et al. (2019)  analyzed how I4.0 can further promote the resource sharing within the technological cycles. Ramakrishna et al. (2020)  performed a study linking these two main topics in a university environment. The work of Hatzivasilis et al. (2018)  described the potential of IoT as a facilitator for CE. Hence, it is clear that the CE-I4.0 nexus is a promising research topic that links groundbreaking technologies to system-wide shifts in our economic and industrial models. In this context, the goal of this article is to perform a literature review in order to identify the main SDG and targets addressed by the combination of I4.0 and CE, as well as to understand how the CE-I4.0 nexus contributes to them. As far as the authors are aware, this publication is the first to simultaneously address CE, I4.0, and the SDG. Thus, the innovation of this article is in the crossroads between the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the fundamental shifts brought by CE, and the efforts towards sustainable development. The remainder of the article presents as follows: Section 2  presented the methodology used in the study. Bibliometric and content-specific results are present in Section 3 . Section 4  explores SDG and targets addressed by the CE-I4.0 nexus. Closing the manuscript, Section 5  provides final remarks and future research trends.  2 Methodology This article proposes a simultaneous analysis of the existing literature regarding SDG, CE, and I4.0 through the following research question: “How the combination of CE practices and I4.0 technologies contribute to the achievement of the SDG?”. A review was conducted to answer this question. According to Fink (2005) , a literature review is a systematic and reproducible study design to identify, evaluate, and interpret the existing body of scientific publications. Additionally, this type of study provides an overview of a research topic and help researchers develop conceptual content regarding a specific scientific area (Meredith, 1993 ). The review was performed through the adaption of the step procedures proposed by Barros et al. (2019)  and Coutinho et al. (2019) . Fig. 2   illustrates the literature review methodology. 2.1 Topic delimitation According to the research question, the articles included in this review analyze how CE and/or I4.0 assist in achieving the SDG. Only peer-reviewed papers published in English were considered. Since all subjects addressed by this study are emerging topics, no time delimitation was set for this review. The search was conducted in June 2020 and includes all articles published until now.  2.2 Portfolio definition Step 1: Definition of keywords  This research phase was divided into two parts: first, the articles focused on the link between CE or I4.0 with the SDG were addressed; and second, the mutual implementation of CE practices and I4.0 technologies towards sustainable practices were approached. Thus, the keywords used in the two searches are:   • Group A: ("ODS" OR "SGD" OR "sustainable development goals") AND ("industry 4.0″ OR "smart manufacturing" OR "industrie 4.0″ OR "circular economy").  • Group B: ("circular economy" OR "CE") AND ("sustainability" OR "sustainable development") AND ("industry 4.0″ OR "industrie 4.0″ OR "internet of things" OR "iot" OR "smart manufacturing" OR "smart industry").   According to Purvis et al. (2019) , the term sustainability is often used as a synonym for sustainable development, which explains the use of this keyword in Group B. The term “ODS” is the abbreviated translation for SDG in Iberian languages (Spanish, Portuguese, and other Latin languages). “Industrie 4.0″ represents the German term Industry 4.0. Such keywords were chosen to broaden the analysis and collect more insights from the assembled publications.  Step 2 and 3: Database definition and document collection  The Scopus and Web of Science databases were chosen due to their comprehensiveness and relevance in this field of research. Compared to other databases, these had significantly more results. The search was made according to the criteria mentioned in the previous topic.  Step 4: Portfolio screening  Following the search conduction, duplicates were removed with the help of the Endnote  software. The Filtering happened by reading the title, abstract, introduction, results, and conclusion of all articles. The documents that addressed the research question were selected to compose the final portfolio.  Step 5: Final portfolio definition  Once all articles were identified, the items were collected and managed through the software Zotero v5.0 . The publications were then transferred to spreadsheets and organized based on the selected criteria for the further extraction of results and content analysis.     2.3 Descriptive analysis A quantitative analysis was performed to characterize the final portfolio. The selected articles were inspected according to the year of publication, journals, and the type of study applied to each article. Publications were divided in four different types of studies: review articles, case study, methodological development and mixed study. The latter refers to the papers that combined two of the beforementioned sort of analysis (i.e. literature review combined with case study, or methodological development combined with case study).  2.4 Content analysis The complete analysis of the final portfolio refers to the results of this research. The applied I4.0 technologies and the practices carried out within the CE context were selected and classified. Following, based on the portfolio's content, the main SDG addressed by the combination of CE and I4.0 were identified. Subsequently, it was possible to highlight how the CE-I4.0 nexus contributes to the achievement of specific SDG targets.   3 Results The performed literature search resulted in 141 publications. Fig. 3   shows the selection process that resulted in the research portfolio. Duplicates accounted for 59 excluded studies, followed by exclusion of another 32 papers during full-text reading. A total of 50 articles were selected after the application of the review protocol and the three-round exclusion process. It is noteworthy that both CE and I4.0 are emerging topics (Abbasi and Kamal, 2020 ; Korhonen et al., 2018 ), and recently scholars started to address the hidden linkages between such areas (Dev et al., 2020 ; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018 ). Therefore, this study presents the selection of cutting-edge studies and solutions that address the SDG via the combination of CE and I4.0. Subsequently, the bibliometric results and publication trends are examined, followed by the results regarding the CE practices and I4.0 technologies showcased in this literature portfolio. The next section of this article highlights the SDG that are more strongly and directly affected by the new CE-I4.0 nexus. For the full list of publications analyzed, please refer to the Supplementary Material. 3.1 Bibliometric results The analysis of publication trends occurred based on the temporal evolution of articles that focused on I4.0 technologies and/or CE practices under a sustainability perspective, the publication distribution by peer-reviewed journals, and the type of study. Fig. 4   shows the evolution of the topic over the years. As the review had no temporal restrictions, articles published up to the date of search (June/2020) were selected. Results shows that the first attempt to link either of the two pillar topics of this research with sustainable development or the SDG was made by Reuter (2016) . The author's work addressed simultaneously CE and I4.0 by analyzing the digitalization potential of CE through the implementation of IoT in the metallurgical sector. Interest in the addressed scientific area followed in 2017 through the publication of two studies, both presenting CE as pathway to sustainable development (Mestre and Cooper, 2017 ; Velenturf and Purnell, 2017 ). The number of publications quadrupled in 2018 (eight publications), and then doubled in 2019 (16 publications). By then, the linkages of both CE and I4.0 with sustainable development and their potential to contribute to achieving the SDG targets had become an emerging topic between scholars (Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019 ; Schroeder et al., 2019 ). The year 2020 seems to mark the consolidation of the addressed items as pathways to a more sustainable and effective industrial sector and overall society. Since this review was conducted in June/2020, the portfolio only gathered articles published in the first semester of the mentioned year. Albeit the shorter time window in comparison to the other years, 23 of the collected articles were published in 2020. The exponential growth of interest in the topics discussed in this work hints at the CE-I4.0 nexus as an emerging scientific topic that presents innumerous applications and potential growth as our society slowly shift its production, consumption, and technological development patterns. The assembled publications spread throughout journals with different scientific backgrounds. Since both CE and I4.0 feature options and solutions that can be applied in a variety of sectors and scales, the journals range from technological and computational research platforms to environmental and sustainability focused research. However, only four journals had more than one publication that fitted the selected scope of this research (International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology  – two articles, Journal of Cleaner Production –  four articles, Resource, Conservation, and Recycling –  five articles,  and Sustainability –  nine articles). All other papers are scattered throughout 30 other journals. These results show that CE and I4.0 are in the research schedule of scholars from different backgrounds, hinting at the importance given to the topics,  and the broadness that solutions built under this scope can achieve. Table 2   shows the article classification distribution. Nine papers, accounting for 18% of the selected portfolio, have theoretical purposes. This cluster mainly focuses on the proposition of novel frameworks, business models, or methodological explorations regarding the individual applications. However, most of the reviewed publications had a practical objective. 17 articles (35%) had a strict goal of displaying case studies. Four articles focused on presenting systematic literature reviews on the given topics. Lastly, 20 papers, accounting for 40% of the studied publications, coupled the presentation of case study with either a literature review, or a piece of methodological development (commonly a framework proposal). These findings shows that scholars focused on the CE-I4.0-sustainability background are currently interested in the practical potential that the CE and I4.0 concepts, as well as their possible implications for the sustainability agenda.  3.2 CE practices and I4.0 technologies In order to link this new model directed by the principles of CE and embedded in highly functional systems operationalized by I4.0 technologies, first it is necessary to distinguish which practices and technologies have been applied in the current context. Table 3   compiles the CE practices and I4.0 technologies correlated to each publication analyzed in the literature review. In order to direct the reader, it is relevant to stress that the conducted literature search focused on papers that applied either CE practices and/or I4.0 technologies in order to seek more sustainable system, hence contributing to achieving the SDG. It is also noteworthy that some of the collected papers simultaneously addressed I4.0 and CE, both intentionally, or unintentionally (i.e. papers that present the benefits of I4.0 technologies regarding waste prevention, reuse, or recycle, but not particularly mention CE). The majority of the evaluated publications consisted of papers that link CE to notions of sustainability. This group accounts for 24 papers, almost half of the investigated cohort (48%). These results contributes to the work of several authors that argue that CE presents a deep connection to the sustainability agenda by providing the opportunity for the operationalization of many sustainable practices (Ghisellini et al., 2016 ; Ghosh and Agamuthu, 2018 ; Kirchherr et al., 2017 ). In contrast, only five publications addressed solely I4.0 practices and their potential to support the Agenda 2030 goals, accounting for 10% of the portfolio. However, 34% of the inspected papers (17 publications) either had a mutual focus on CE and I4.0, or presented the benefits of the implementation of I4.0 technologies, which ultimately lead to practices and business models linked to CE. These findings contributes to the results presented in Section 3.1  by highlighting the growing scientific interest towards the CE-I4.0 nexus and the potential of these synergies to contribute to sustainable development. Lastly, four review papers (8%) were examined in this study, and therefore do not show any specific I4.0 technology or CE practice. Regarding the CE practices funded, the investigated processes were separated focused on their relation to the “R's”, as this approach is vastly defended by many authors as mechanisms presented in the core of CE (Blomsma and Brennan, 2017 ; Ghisellini et al., 2018 ; Sihvonen and Ritola, 2015 ). Other activities or techniques strongly linked to CE and broadly disseminated in the scientific community were also applied a screening criteria in Table 3 . Examples are industrial symbiosis (Brondi et al., 2018 ; Geng et al., 2014 ; Liu et al., 2016 ), waste-to-energy (Khan and Kabir, 2020 ; Sadhukhan et al., 2020 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ), and composting (Aziz et al., 2016 ; Fassio and Tecco, 2019 ; Filippini et al., 2019 ). The majority of publications relates to the technological cycles of CE, rather than the biological cycles. The inclination towards the technological context was expected, since many of the articles deal with a combined setting between CE and I4.0, where the industrial and manufacturing processes are in focus, and the practices directed to the biological cycle are not as critical. With respect to the analyzed I4.0 technologies, the applications presented in the paper were screened according to the I4.0 pillars proposed by Rüssmann et al. (2015) , presented in Fig. 1 . It can be noticed that the majority of the studies either focused on a specific technology (i.e. IoT, AM, or BD), or took a broader approach by highlighting the potential of a variety of I4.0 related technologies. These findings stress the integrative characteristics of I4.0 (Wang et al., 2017 ), in which different interconnected technologies can be simultaneously applied in order to promote higher efficiency and control over a specific manufacturing, industrial, or complex system (Belaud et al., 2019 ; Halse and Jæger, 2019 ; Lu, 2017 ).  3.3 SDG addressed in the literature portfolio The SDG are interconnected goals underlined in the UN Agenda 2030 (UN, 2015 ). This model revolutionizes the view at development, moving away from the current setting where social, economic, and ecological sectors are seen as separated parts. This approach proposes transitioning towards an economy that serves society, while still safeguarding the environment (Rockström et al., 2009 ). The relation between the SDG and the three areas they connect (Biosphere, Society, and Economy) is illustrated in Fig. 5  . The links between the SDG were directly and indirectly approached in the reviewed portfolio, showing differing opinions regarding which SDG are contemplated by CE or I4.0. The analyzed publications showed often contrasting options concerning the CE-related SDG. However, they converge by relating this model shift to the economy and biosphere sectors of Fig. 5 . According to Rodriguez-Anton et al. (2019) , CE is directly related to SDG 8, 9, 11, and 12, and indirectly pertinent to SDG 13 and 14. This analysis gives CE an economic focus with respect to the SDG, as the majority of the mentioned goals are linked to the economic sector of the before mentioned figure. In contrast, Venkata Mohan et al. (2019)  argue that CE is deeply connected with SDG 11, and in second hand deals with sociological and ecological goals. Principato et al. (2019) , on the other hand, points out that CE can be an accelerator to the targets set in the Agenda 2030, especially by playing a vital role as a key solution towards production and consumption behaviors and patterns, addressed in SDG 12. Additionally, Schroeder et al. (2019)  argue that the strongest link between the SDG targets and CE are linked to the SDG 6, 7, 8 and 12. The inconsistencies regarding the scholar's opinion in relation to which SDG does CE contributes can be extended to the full analyzed portfolio. Nonetheless, a strong link between the economy and biosphere directed SDG seems unanimous between the analyzed articles. A similar approach can be found while analyzing the SDG addressed in the I4.0 related articles. Bonilla et al. (2018)  suggest that I4.0 has the potential to strongly affect the SDG 7, 9, 12, and 13. The work of Modgil et al. (2020)  attests that I4.0 can contribute to SDG 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Furthermore, a study developed by Oláh et al. (2020)  points that I4.0 is a driver towards achieving the goals set by SDG 7, 8, 12, and 13. This trend follows to the other I4.0 related studies in the studied portfolio. Hence, in general, the authors agree on the potential of I4.0 to address the issues set by the societal and economic sectors presented in Fig. 5 . Drawing from the before mentioned results, this study sets out to analyze the effects of the combination between CE practices and I4.0 technologies with the following SDG:• SDG 7  • SDG 8  • SDG 9  • SDG 11  • SDG 12  • SDG 13    It is the opinion of the authors that the application of I4.0 technologies in circular systems can strongly benefit the beforementioned SDG. The following section presents discussions related to this set list of SDG in order to better comprehend the hidden links between these three movements of structural shift in our society, dentify the specific SDG targets covered by the CE-I.40 nexus, and lay out future research agendas.   4 SDG and targets addressed by the CE-I4.0 nexus Sustainable development is an underlining goal common to all nations and formally structured into the SDG. Innovative technologies, behavioral changes, and systematic shifts related to the means of production and consumption are critical to seek such objectives. In this way, this topic aims to present the results found in the performed literature review regarding the CE-I4.0 nexus and provide insights whether and how it contributes to the achievement of the targets set in the SDG. However, due to the systemic perspective applied to both the addressed subjects, the combination between CE and I4.0 can both bring positive and negative feedbacks. One of the mutually shared problems faced by I4.0 and CE is related to the impact on the social aspects of sustainability caused by a cultural reflex intrinsic to these new global proposals (Bai et al., 2020 ; Lee, 2020 ). The main discussion is associated with job generation (Korhonen et al., 2018 ; Romero et al., 2020 ). CE represents an economic shift with repercussions along the employment market like no other. For example, it can allegedly generate more than 3 million jobs only in the European Union by 2030 (WRAP et al., 2015 ). However, these new jobs would come at the cost of old jobs, which due to technological progress and business models changes, would substitute the workforce needed in the current setting. Additionally, it is estimated that around 8.5% of the global manufacturing workforce will be replaced by I4.0 technologies by 2030, accounting for 14 million manufacturing jobs lost only in China  (Oxford Economics, 2019 ). To couple with this problematic, the transition to CE and I4.0 has to be supported by learning environments capable of promoting the adaption needed by the workforce in this new highly technological and sustainability-driven world (Kirchherr and Piscicelli, 2019 ; Quint et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, there are several points of positive convergence between CE, I4.0, and the SDG. These convergences are mainly directed to the overall promotion of environmental sustainability through the implementation of technologies for the benefit of circular practices that could lead to a path to achieve sustainability (Oláh et al., 2020 ). That alliance could enhance the optimization of processes, implementation of cost-efficiently technologies, reduction of emissions and excessive use of resources (Dev et al., 2020 ; Pham et al., 2019 ). Thus, the synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE seems evident. In this way, it can be noticed there are several ways to make the best of each innovative technology in favor of CE and sustainability. Therefore, the following topics comprehensively approach the main SDG related to CE and I4.0. Through that analysis, specific SDG targets addressed by the CE-I4.0 nexus are listed in Table 4   and discussed in the following text. 4.1 SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy SDG 7 seeks to ensure the availability of reliable and renewable energy for all. Along the same line, CE encourages the transition to a model based on economic, natural and social capital, underpinned by the use of renewable energy (EMF, 2015 ; Khan and Kabir, 2020 ). By decoupling society from the use of fossil fuels, CE endorses the broad use of greener energy sources in order to reduce pollution, raw materials use, and waste generation. Moreover, CE links this topic with the issue of organic waste management. By addressing waste-to-energy practices, such as energy production via biomass, CE simultaneously promotes the use of renewables, guarantee energy access to remote areas where energy networks might be difficult to reach (particularly in developing countries) (Khan and Kabir, 2020 ; Padilla-Rivera et al., 2019 ), and tackles the inefficient disposal of valuable organic resources (Belaud et al., 2019 ; Udugama et al., 2020 ). When analyzed in an industrial setting, the combination of CE and I4.0 towards SDG 7 can result in greater achievements (Halse and Jæger, 2019 ; Oláh et al., 2020 ). The implementation of technologies like IIoT, BD, DDA, and CPPS can transform an industrial environment through the intensive collection and communication of data, which, when directed to energy and resource-related issues, can largely improve its efficiency and increase the capacity of clean energy use and production (Modgil et al., 2020 ; Oláh et al., 2020 ). Therewith, the optimization brought by I4.0 deeply contribute to the understanding and promotion of cleaner energy systems by allowing the tracking and interpretation of populational and industrial consumption patterns, followed by the development of solutions through innovative technologies to adapt such backgrounds to a sustainability-driven society. In this regard, the combination of the renewable-intensive paradigm shift brought by CE with optimized resource and energy employment enabled by I4.0 can directly contribute to achieving the SDG 7. More specifically, the CE-I4.0 nexus addresses SDG 7 targets 7.1, 7.2, and 7.B, as shown in Table 4 . Guided these specific targets, policymakers can seek to develop laws and incentives aimed at renewable energy sector, which would not only minimize the amount of fossil fuels consumed worldwide, but also create new jobs and accelerate the transition to CE. Moreover, as I4.0 technologies expand and become accessible to all sorts of industrial sectors, the use of renewable fuels to power the autonomous and interconnected machinery needed for optimization-focused fourth industrial revolution will grow. Therefore, to combine with the energy-intensive needs of both circular systems and I4.0, renewable and affordable energy becomes imperative. This rationale is especially true to the developing countries, as highlighted by target 7.B.  4.2 SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth SDG 8 is directed to the promotion of economic growth while still inclusively providing employment and fair work for all. This SDG is the most controversial one between the six chosen goals analyzed in Section 4 . That happens due to the divergences already mentioned in this study. Both CE and I4.0 provide pathways to a new setting of economic development. However, the combination of CE and I4.0 directly affects the job market. According to Smit et al. (2016) , I4.0 it brings a significant transformation in jobs and skills profiles by blurring the traditional clear division of labor in manufacturing. Quint et al. (2015)  foresees that this new scenario will not only requires workers to be trained efficiently, but also to understand the principles and paradigms of a digitalized and fully connected factory. Moreover, as noted by Schlaepfer et al. (2014) , groundbreaking technologies require a different set of skills, potentially influencing the job market, leading then to income disparity and uncertainty. Faced by this new context in which old jobs may become obsolete and leave many workers unemployed (especially low-income and formally uneducated workers in developing countries), business and training bodies need to rapidly adapt to better support the working class in the transition to a technology intensive CE (Phung, 2019 ). Although several international organizations argue that CE has the potential of creating millions of jobs throughout the next decade (EMF, 2015 ; IISD, 2018 ; WRAP et al. 2015 ), other authors indicate that this model shift focusses on the environment and economic benefits only, lacking care for societal issues like the reinsertion of workers into the market, or the job quality it provides (D'Amato et al., 2020b ; Lee, 2020 ). As a response to that problematic, Kirchherr and Piscicelli (2019)  pioneered by addressing the topic of Education for Circular Economy , that could help fill this gap left in the early development of this paradigm shift. Similarly, several I4.0-focused authors have explored how to further the technological development caused by I4.0 while still ensuring that the overall social sustainability is addressed (Hahn, 2020 ; Romero et al., 2020 ; Stock et al., 2018 ). On those premises, it can be noticed that although the CE-I4.0 nexus brings several challenges to the job market, collaborations and developments needed in order to bridge that gap are in course, what could significantly aid in the race towards achieving SDG 8. In terms of economic growth, the joined forces of I4.0 and CE strongly contribute to the development of economies and societies. As stressed by D'Amato et al. (2020b) , the economic development is in the core of CE, which now, differently than in the Linear Economy is intrinsically connected with environmental precautions and practices (Nasir et al., 2017 ). According to Lacy and Rutqvist (2015) , shifting to a circular system offers a $4.5 trillion economic opportunity , which would increase our economic resilience while reducing the reliance on scarce resources. Therefore, as both CE and I4.0 propose the emergence of novel business models and the maximization and optimization of the means of production, this higher-efficiency system makes companies more competitive and, consequently, positively influences overall economic development. The SDG 8 targets that better translate how the combination of CE and I4.0 can propel sustainable economic growth are targets 8.2 and 8.4, which clearly connects economic development to the systematic shift that CE and I4.0 may cause if implemented together (Table 4 ). However, the CE-I4.0 nexus can also address the employment-linked targets 8.5 and 8.6 if the beforementioned measures directed to learning and training are adopted in order to support the population in the awakening to this economic new model. In order to extract the maximum value from the CE-I4.0 nexus, decision makers should not only focus on the gains the circular systems connected through I4.0 technologies could bring. It is crucial to follow the “leave no one behind ” motto of the SDG and create employment and learning platforms to accommodate workers in this high-tech world, and also to reallocate the many that will, inevitably, be substituted but autonomous machines. The CE-I4.0 shows tremendous opportunities for economic growth, but in order to seek a more prosperous and sustainable future, the economic development has to be attached to social issues, as stated in the forenamed targets.  4.3 SDG 9 – industry, innovation and infrastructure According to the performed literature review, the targets and compromises set by SDG 9 are the most aligned with I4.0,  since it aims at building the structure necessary to foster inclusive and sustainable industrialization. SDG 9 is also the one most linked with technological advancements, which are the core of the I4.0. These systems promote the achievement of this particular SDG by translating the technological and innovative development to the industrial settings, optimizing manufacturing processes and better applying energy and material resources in the industrial level (Modgil et al., 2020 ). Therewith, I4.0 helps in the development of a resilient industrial infrastructure through the implementation of cutting-edge technologies that can ensure lean and safer production systems, further contributing to the overall sustainability of urban areas (Luthra et al., 2020 ). Additionally, both the work of Bonilla et al. (2018)  and Oláh et al. (2020)  argue that I4.0 assists in the decrease in energy and material flows in the industrial environment. That happens mainly through the implementation of IIoT, CPPS, DDA, BD, AM, and new business models grounded in new technologies and frameworks (Belaud et al., 2019 ; Cruz Sanchez et al., 2020 ; Panetto et al., 2019 ). The same authors also state that, in consideration of SDG 9, I4.0 enhances opportunities towards environmental sustainability by promoting an extended integration with CE. Thus, I4.0 not only is in the core of SDG 9, acting as a valuable driver to achieving the set targets, but also contributes to the promotion of CE, which, in turn, also fosters the compromises set by the same SDG. The mutually positive combination of I4.0 and CE in the context of SDG 9 contributes directly to the achievement of the SDG 9 targets 9.1, 9.2, and 9.4 (Table 4 ). Hence, the goals set by this SDG represent the elements of facilities and infrastructures for a new circular model (Schroeder et al., 2019 ), while the I4.0 represents the new background in which SDG 9 is handled and worked upon (Berawi, 2019 ). Against that background, target 9.4 advocates the for sustainable use of resources and environmentally clean technologies. This target is especially important to the CE-I4.0 nexus, as it reminds decision makers the industrial sector has to operate within current the environmental constrains and serve as a driver to the implementation of greener technologies. Accordingly, most of the future research needs in the CE-I4.0 nexus is aligned with this SDG, as the industry and infrastructure sectors can work as great platforms for the implementation of circular solutions boosted by I4.0 tech. Therefore, we argue that the industrial activity is one crucial driver for the CE-I4.0, being the perfect environment to link these two growing trends and scale up circular and sustainable solutions.  4.4 SDG 11 – sustainable cities and communities SDG 11 was created to ensure that communities should be inclusive, resilient, and sustainable. The combination between CE and I4.0 directly contributes to two of the SDG 11 targets presented in the Agenda 2030, namely, 11.6 and 11.B. Other targets can be indirectly affected, such as 11.2 and 11.7. However, as previously pointed out, this analysis focus on the stronger links between the SDG and the CE-I4.0 nexus. In this setting, the role of I4.0 towards SDG 11 lies in providing the technological tools to better enhance sustainability of cities and communities through the implementation of CE practices. Additionally, I4.0 technologies like automatization, CC, BD and Cybersecurity can also contribute to city-wide systems like transport, lighting, logistics and security (Bai et al., 2020 ; Chiappetta Jabbour et al., 2020 ; Pham et al., 2019 ). However, the beforementioned targets make it clear that better air quality, waste management and climate change mitigation are critical for a sustainable and resilient urban scenario. As highlighted by the performed literature review, CE practices optimized by I4.0 technologies can address all of these issues, and provide a pathway to achieving SDG 11 (Hossain et al., 2020 ; Lausselet et al., 2017 ). An example is brought by the work of Kerdlap et al. (2019) , that through a case study in Singapore, argues that CE practices can be integrated through IoT and a collaborative industrial symbiosis platform in order to endorse the development of Zero Waste Management ecosystems. Similarly, the studies carried by Gutierrez et al. (2015) , Omar et al. (2016) , and Cheng et al. (2017)  further exemplify how I4.0 has become a critical asset to CE practices by promoting smart, interconnected, and data-driven waste management around the world. On those premises, the combination of CE and I4.0 seems to be the future of human settlements and cities. In this future, cities are even more interconnect, and work efficiently through the use of cutting-edge technologies to provide inclusion and better quality of life for all (Velenturf et al., 2018 ). That being said, the CE-I4.0 nexus is a valuable asset towards the achievement of SDG 11, especially by the targets indicated in Table 4 . The urban environment and public services (i.e. waste collection and treatment) are also platforms to scale up sustainable solutions based on the CE-I4.0 nexus, although the majority of studied and applications focus on the industrial sector. Future policies and research can be directed to the implementation of I4.0 technologies in public sectors to boost circular initiatives, what would contributes to disseminate such concepts in non-industrial contexts.  4.5 SDG 12 – responsible consumption and production SDG 12 may be one of the most aligned goals regarding CE guidelines. For instance, the European Union published an action plan that clearly states that CE is a system-wide solution strongly directed to promoting sustainable consumption and production modalities, and therefore contributing to the achievement the targets set by this particular SDG (EC, 2015 ; Rodriguez-Anton et al., 2019 ). Thereby, CE practices like reuse, recycling, recovery, waste prevention, and safe disposal approaches are treasured assets to SDG 12 (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2020 ), especially concerning targets 12.2, 12.3, and 12.5 (Table 4 ). However, I4.0 is also an important tool towards this goal, particularly with respect to responsible and sustainable production, addressed by target 12.A. Cutting-edge technologies, such as the ones showcased in Fig. 1 , are revolutionizing the way corporations operate their manufacturing lines. There is a growing investment in the optimization of the operating systems, transforming the industrial environment in high-tech data-driven installations interconnected by communication devices (Bai et al., 2020 ; Hatzivasilis et al., 2019 ; Manavalan and Jayakrishna, 2019 ). In this new framework, excess in the use of resources, energy, and waste generation are minimalized by data gathering and monitoring, which indicates a convergence with the CE principles of reducing raw resource use and designing out waste and pollution (Andrews, 2015 ; Inoue et al., 2020 ) Additionally, CE goes beyond sustainable production and acts on responsible consumption as well. A growing trend can be found regarding circular business models structed around digitalization and the Product as a Service (PaaS) rationale (Bressanelli et al., 2018 ; Geissdoerfer et al., 2018 ; Goyal et al., 2018 ). Through PaaS, consumers pay for services that they momentarily use without having to ever own the product, which then can be used by multiple costumers and further promote a sharing economy (Chiappetta Jabbour et al., 2020 ). Therefore, this business model helps reducing the amount of raw materials necessary to produce goods and products. As mentioned by Reuter (2016) , business models built upon PaaS often rely on the digitalization of services, further reducing the amount of resources needed to serve a larger group of individuals. These new CE-related companies rely also on I4.0 technologies to deliver their services. For instance, CPS, IoT, Blockchain and AI are now tools employed by the majority of worldwide known high-tech start-ups, large corporation, and emerging companies in the new finance markets (Christidis and Devetsikiotis, 2016 ; Lu, 2017 ; Stock et al., 2018 ). Therefore, a large array of problems related to linear patterns may be addressed by combining CE practices with I4.0 technologies, which, in turn, directly contributes to achieving the SDG 12 targets 12.2, 12.3, 12.5, and 12.A, as indicated by Table 4 .  4.6 SDG 13 – climate action SDG 13 urges governments, corporations and the civil society to take climate action and proactively cut down greenhouse gas emission in order to tackle climate change. There is no doubt that a transition from the current Linear Economy to CE would intensively contribute to a more environmentally sustainable world (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017 ; Ghisellini et al., 2016 ), in which society can prosper while reducing the anthropogenic pressure applied onto the natural systems (Rockström et al., 2009 ). In fact, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a leading organization focused on accelerating the transition to CE, published in 2019 its report “Completing the Picture – How the Circular Economy Tackles Climate Change ” (EMF, 2019 ). This publication highlights that a circular model has the potential to tackle 45% of global greenhouse gas emissions by addressing five key areas – steel, plastic, aluminum, cement, and food. The capacity of CE to contribute to targets set SDG 13 is also stressed by the work of several authors (D'Amato et al., 2020b ; Inoue et al., 2020 ; Schroeder et al., 2019 ). Objectively, CE practices have the potential to boost climate action and contribute to climate mitigation by restructuring energy and resource inefficient supply chains and extracting the maximum value out of a product or service throughout its life cycle (Ghisellini et al., 2016 ). For example, by promoting the reuse, recycling and remanufacturing of products, instead of pushing for the manufacturing of new goods, CE assists in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation (Lausselet et al., 2017 ; Sadhukhan et al., 2020 ). Additionally, circular systems are underlined by the use and promotion of renewable energy (Hossain et al., 2020 ; Linser and Lier, 2020 ), decoupling society from the use of carbon-intensive fossil fuels. Nonetheless, it is crucial to stress that circular systems are not necessarily the most sustainable option or are responsible for fewer emissions. As highlighted by de Souza Junior et al. (2020) , circular systems can present negative relationships regarding sustainability and circularity. Geissdoerfer et al. (2017)  and Liu et al. (2017)  corroborate with that view by stressing the possibility of trade-offs between environmental impacts. Therefore, in order to understand the overall benefits of circular systems and better design end-of-life strategies, it is import to apply a systematic perspective based on life cycle thinking and environmental accounting methodologies (Elia et al., 2017 ; Homrich et al., 2018 ; Kalmykova et al., 2018 ). In this context, I4.0 brings solutions to CE issues by optimizing its practices through the use of innovative technologies (Oláh et al., 2020 ). Although a circular system is not always less emission-intensive, the implementation of IoT, BD, AM or Blockchain may help reducing the energy and material flow necessary to a certain production by better monitoring the amounts of resource applied (Andoni et al., 2019 ; Bonilla et al., 2018 ), and thereby reducing emissions generation and emissions. Differently than the other five discussed SDG, it is difficult to pinpoint specific targets that the combination of I4.0 and CE could contribute in this setting, even though this relationship strongly assists in tackling climate change and promoting climate action. The target that more closely addresses the CE-I4.0 nexus is target 13.2 (Table 4 ). Here, the macro scale of circular economy and governmental incentives for I4.0 development and implementation can be emphasized. However, as corroborated by the studies of Schroeder et al. (2019) , Rodriguez-Anton et al. (2019)  and Oláh et al. (2020) , the real benefits of the CE-I4.0 nexus towards SDG 13 go beyond the targets set, and lie in the potential of these systematic shifts in aiding climate change mitigation. As the adherence to CE and I4.0 grows worldwide, it is up to researchers and governmental institutions to monitor the progress and impact of the CE-I4.0 nexus towards climate change. Future research could apply environmental accounting methodologies like Life Cycle assessment, Material Flow Analysis and Energy Analysis to systems embedded in the CE-I4.0 nexus with the propose to continuously track and mitigate the impacts of the systems shifts. Accordantly, decision makers should consider this analytical approach when implementing the actions and strategies displayed by target 13.2.\  4.7 SDG indirectly affected by the combination of CE and I4.0 Although the objective of this research was to highlight how the application of I4.0 technologies to circular systems can directly aid towards the achievements of the SDG targets, the executed systematic review also provides complementary results. Apart from the SDG mentioned in Table 4 , the association of CE concepts and practices to the new technologies developed under the I4.0 umbrella indirectly benefit an alternative list of SDG. Due to these secondary relationships, the effects of the CE-I4.0 nexus according to specific targets of indirectly affected SDG were not deeply perused in this research. Based on the review's findings, three of the SDG related to the Biosphere sector of Fig. 5  could benefit from a stronger development between I4.0 and circular systems. In this context, we argue the alignment between SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11, and SDG 12 could be of service to the targets set by SDG 14 and 15, which are directed to the conservation and restoration of ecosystems. That relation is built on the fact that, currently, these natural environments suffer immense pressure from the anthropogenic factors, leading to issues like marine plastic pollution and deforestation (Li et al., 2016 ; Linser and Lier, 2020 ). Through more environmentally sustainable production, consumption, and behavioral patterns, the impact on these ecosystems may be eased. Smart waste management, waste minimization, and the restorage of natural systems advocated by CE are practices and solutions that can contribute to this problematic. As stated throughout this paper, I4.0 can improve CE strategies and methods by amplifying its positive impacts, and, in this case, contributing to the biosphere-related SDG. This analysis is corroborated by the research carried out by Rodriguez-Anton et al. (2019)  and Schroeder et al. (2019) . Regarding the Societal and Economic sectors of Fig. 5 , the CE-I4.0 nexus may improve the current global contexts tackled by SDG 1, SDG 2, and SDG 10. The reasons for that lies in the controversial revolution that CE and I4.0 might impose onto the job market (Hahn, 2020 ; Phung, 2019 ). In the case these drastic shifts promote job creation and reallocation worldwide due to the need to suffice new technologies and business models, the new positions created could imply in reduced inequalities and poverty in a sustainability-drive workspace, while also tackling the hunger-related issues (Chhipi-Shrestha et al., 2015 ; Milica and Milica, 2020 ). Moreover, CE is posed as a treasured solution to food security (Flynn et al., 2019 ; Hidalgo et al., 2020 ). If powered by I4.0, food scarcity can also be addressed through the comprehensive implementation of CE practices and principles. Lastly, we argue that although the indirect links cited above may sound fragile due to the many linkages presented between the SDG set in Agenda 2030, several authors emphasize that the SDG are an interconnected strategy for sustainable development (Alcamo, 2019 ; Meurs et al., 2019 ; Santika et al., 2019 ). All the 17 SDG tackle complex and systemic issues that have hidden linkages with other deeper problematics. Consequently, by contributing to a specific goal, one might encounter difficulties related to a second SDG. That is also the reason for the creation of SDG 17, which urges for the revitalization and implementation of global partnerships in order to address the sustainability agenda. Against that background, we argue that CE and I4.0 are also indirectly related to this last SDG, as both topics depend on the intersectoral agreements and engagement to power the crossing to a sustainability-driven and highly technological society.   5 Conclusions The Agenda 2030 was created as an instrument to promote worldwide action regarding the most important pressing issues. With the objective to leave no one behind, the 17 SDG, an interconnected list of goals, targets, and indicators were created to guide governments, intuitions and the civil society towards sustainable development. At the same time, two emerging systematic shifts are currently in progress – the development of I4.0 and the transition to CE. Against that background, this research set out to link these three topics through a systematic literature review and investigate if and how the combination of CE and I4.0 can contribute to achieving the targets set in the SDG. Results show that there is a rising interest in the practical applications of both CE and I4.0 as pathways to achieving sustainable solutions. The CE-I4.0 nexus directly responds to targets set by SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12 and SDG 13 (Table 4 ), which addresses the three main areas handled by the SDG (biosphere, economy and society). We conclude that the CE-I4.0 nexus holds a large array of opportunities for the further development of sustainable practices and solutions, ultimately contributing to the achievement of the SDG. Thereby, this research serves as a guide to decision and policymakers. The findings and discussion put forward in Section 4  identify specific targets that can be addressed by the CE-I4.0 nexus and provide stakeholders with broader perspective of how can CE and I4.0 can form a joint platform for the development of sustainable practices. As far as the authors are aware, this research is the first one to simultaneously link the SDG to CE and I4.0. Therefore, there are still several gaps that could be further investigated. Section 4.7  presents a second list of SDG that are indirectly affected by the combination of CE-I4.0 nexus, representing an option for future research. Moreover, further investigations could focus on case studies of systems inserted in the CE-4.0 nexus to access its impact regarding greenhouse gas emission, job creation and reallocation, production models etc. Although the combination of these two topics is growing in the industrial sector, we identified the need for further research and implementation of I4.0 tech in circular system connected to urban environments and the public sectors. Furthermore, as the economic pillar is often referred to as the decisive factor in sustainability dialogues, economic feasibility studies focused on the CE-I4.0 nexus are essential. Future investigation regarding policymaking and the governmental incentives to boost combination of this sustainability-driven model alongside with the current rising high-technological revolution is recommended. Lastly, as the three main areas addressed by this research are emerging topics, future systematic reviews with similar goals could point out the SDG responses to the further development of the CE-I4.0 nexus.
