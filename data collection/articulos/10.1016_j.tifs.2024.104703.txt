                  Background
                  Food systems are complex networks of supply and demand value chains that have profound effects on human health, environmental sustainability, and economic development. Concerns about the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of these systems have become increasingly acute due to challenges such as population growth coupled with an emerging middle class, urbanization, resource competition, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. The United Nations has set Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address the interplay between social, economic, and environmental factors but the specific steps needed to transition from the current state towards the targets are less clear.
               
                  Scope and approach
                  This review aims to explore the role of value chains, specifically the value addition brought by food processing, in transforming food systems outcomes towards achieving SDGs. Both benefits and challenges associated with food processing were assessed in producing safe, nutritious, and affordable food while optimizing resource use.
               
                  Key findings and conclusions
                  The review emphasizes the importance of food processing for food safety and supply, its impact on the nutritional value of foods, and it showcases examples of converging nutritional and environmental goals. It highlights the potential of digital tools and systemic perspectives in accelerating the required transformations within food systems. These require efficient collaborations to effectively address the trade-offs that arise when pursuing multiple transformation goals. Accurate, reliable and evidence-based information should be shared among stakeholders and be used for consumer information to empower their informed decisions about the safety, quality, ethical, and sustainability aspects of the food they consume.

Nestlé 55 Vevey 1800 Switzerland       Handling Editor: Dr. S Charlebois Background Food systems are complex networks of supply and demand value chains that have profound effects on human health, environmental sustainability, and economic development. Concerns about the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of these systems have become increasingly acute due to challenges such as population growth coupled with an emerging middle class, urbanization, resource competition, geopolitical tensions, and climate change. The United Nations has set Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address the interplay between social, economic, and environmental factors but the specific steps needed to transition from the current state towards the targets are less clear.  Scope and approach This review aims to explore the role of value chains, specifically the value addition brought by food processing, in transforming food systems outcomes towards achieving SDGs. Both benefits and challenges associated with food processing were assessed in producing safe, nutritious, and affordable food while optimizing resource use.  Key findings and conclusions The review emphasizes the importance of food processing for food safety and supply, its impact on the nutritional value of foods, and it showcases examples of converging nutritional and environmental goals. It highlights the potential of digital tools and systemic perspectives in accelerating the required transformations within food systems. These require efficient collaborations to effectively address the trade-offs that arise when pursuing multiple transformation goals. Accurate, reliable and evidence-based information should be shared among stakeholders and be used for consumer information to empower their informed decisions about the safety, quality, ethical, and sustainability aspects of the food they consume.   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction Food systems are complex networks that involve various activities, processes, and individuals working together to produce, process, distribute, and consume food (von Braun et al., 2021 ). These systems encompass a wide range of actors, including seed, pesticide, fertilizer and life stock genetics producers, farmers, food processors, distributors, retailers, consumers, researchers, advocacy groups and policymakers. The behaviors of these actors are influenced by a wide range of economic, environmental, and social drivers, and their interactions (Ingram, 2011 ). The actors’ activities give rise to food systems outcomes which are intricately linked to human health, environmental sustainability, and economic development (von Braun et al., 2023 ). Today, food systems face numerous challenges, especially considering the increasing global population, urbanization, and the subsequent higher demand for food and access to it (de Bruin et al., 2021 ; United Nations, 2017 ). This leads to growing competition for arable lands, energy, and freshwater sources, leading to increased land use (deforestation) and biodiversity loss more generally (Carter et al., 2018 ; Gregory & Ingram, 2014 ; Poore & Nemecek, 2018 ), as well as climate change (Vermeulen et al., 2012 ). The growing disposable income of the emerging middle-class results in a higher demand for animal protein (Henchion et al., 2021 ). This trend, combined with issues such as food loss, inefficiencies, waste, and the expanding use of land for animal feed and biofuel production, is placing substantial strain on food systems and the natural resources that support them (Westhoek et al., 2016 ). The dynamics within the food systems are giving rise to complex and unsustainable trajectories related to non-communicable diseases (Ambikapathi et al., 2022 ) and environmental degradation while there is an increasing need to improve access to affordable, healthy, and sustainable diets (Ingram, 2017 ). As a result, the United Nations (UN) has established sustainable development goals (SDGs) aimed at achieving a balance of impact on a wide range of societal interests (United Nations. 2015 ). The SDGs, serve as a roadmap towards food systems outcomes that are simultaneously health and nutrition driven, productive, efficient, equitable and environmentally sustainable (Fan & Pandya-Lorch, 2020 ). While relating to all SDGs to some extent, food systems activities are directly associated with nine of the goals (Fig. 1  ). Encompassing the production, distribution, retail, and consumption of food products, value chains form the backbone of food systems. A food value chain includes all the individuals and organizations involved in the coordinated production of agricultural raw materials and value-adding processes required to create food products (FAO, 2014 ). On the other hand, the term “food systems” includes all aspects and actions related to the production and consumption of food, as well as their impacts on economic, health, and environmental outcomes (FAO, 2018 ). Value chains embrace input and output activities from farm to fork, including waste management, and provide financial opportunities for stakeholders. Value addition can occur at different points along the chain, depending on specific food and market demands. Food processing plays a crucial role in value addition, offering numerous benefits as outlined in Table 1   (Augustin et al., 2016 ; Fellows, 2022 ; Knorr, 2024 ; Shuji, 2022 ; van Boekel et al., 2010 ). It uses diverse resources such as raw (agricultural) materials, water, energy, labor, infrastructure, energy, and knowledge. These resources are used to transform raw materials into intermediate food products, such as flours, sugars, and fats/oils, as well as ready-to-consume food items. Food processing methods often aim to achieve multiple value additions simultaneously. Benefits include ensuring food safety, extending shelf life, enhancing nutritional value, improving sensory appeal, facilitating transportability and storage, increasing accessibility and affordability, and reducing cooking time. In addition to technical aspects, branding and marketing strategies further enhance the value of food products. Marketing efforts can effectively highlight the unique features, quality, and sustainability aspects of food products, thus enabling transparent communication to consumers which can help build consumer trust or support certain habits e.g., sustainable practices (Wu et al., 2021 ). While food processing offers many benefits, it is important to also acknowledge its shortcomings (Table 1 ). Certain processed foods often contain higher levels of added sodium, sugars or saturated fats. Excessive consumption of these nutrients (which have historical roots in traditional preservation and cooking practices) are linked with the development of diet-related non-communicable diseases (Ambikapathi et al., 2022 ). The decision to incorporate ingredients is made during the food formulation step and is mostly independent of the food processing stage. Additionally, food processing can negatively impact the environment through emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), water pollution, and waste production (Kroyer, 1995 ). This review's objective is to present a comprehensive overview of the benefits and challenges related to food processing in the context of food systems and value chains. Furthermore, it aims to explore the specific levers, as outlined in Table 2  , that can play a role in attaining social, environmental, and economic outcomes that align with the SDGs. The goals include: 1) producing safe and nutritious food, 2) developing resource-efficient practices to minimize negative environmental impacts on natural resources, 3) advancing equitable livelihoods by creating jobs, skill and knowledge development and improving access to affordable food offerings relevant to consumer needs. Finally, we discuss various enablers that are needed to manage the necessary transitions in the food systems to achieve a positive impact on the SDGs. Our review is original as 1) it is couched within the food system concept, and 2) it covers very wide literature, drawing out specific angles directly related to SDGs.  2 Producing safe food Food processing plays a positive role in achieving SDGs 2 and 3 by making food safe, palatable, and storable for later consumption. Throughout history, techniques such as cooking, drying, smoking, salting, sugaring, fermenting, and pickling were developed to preserve food and prevent spoilage. In recent decades, advancements in food processing, including canning, pasteurization, retorting, refrigeration, freezing, and other preservation methods, have enabled mass production and distribution of food, contributing to the reduction of the risk of foodborne illnesses and extending shelf life, providing a diverse food offer and contributing to food security (Amit et al., 2017 ; Lorenzo et al., 2018 ). Despite these efforts, foodborne illnesses still pose a significant health threat. A World Health Organization (WHO) report estimated 600 million cases of foodborne illnesses and 420,000 deaths worldwide in 2010 (WHO, 2015 ). In Europe, there were around 23 million foodborne illnesses and 5000 deaths reported in 2015. Salmonella and noroviruses have been identified as a leading cause of recall-associated outbreaks in the USA, with dairy products, beef, and mollusks being commonly implicated (Qiu et al., 2021 ). It is noteworthy that many of these outbreaks are associated with fresh or mildly processed foods. This emphasizes the ongoing significance of proper processing in ensuring food safety to guarantee the provision of a wide array of safe and varied food options (Flynn et al., 2019 ). 2.1 Food processing for food safety and preservation In today's developed food systems almost all food products undergo some thermal treatment, including cooling, heating, or drying, as they move from the farm to the consumer. These processes play a vital role in ensuring that the food is safe from a microbial contaminant viewpoint and suitable for consumption (Table 3  ). Cooling and freezing techniques, developed in the 1920s, are important for both commercial and domestic use in reducing food waste by safely storing fresh products for later use (Tuan Pham, 2014 ). Thermal food processing based on heating to preserve food encompasses a wide range of individual operations, including pasteurization and sterilization as key methods but also blanching, roasting, baking, etc. (Awuah et al., 2007 ). The intensity (energy use) of thermal processes varies significantly, ranging from mild processes such as pasteurization to more stringent processes such as sterilization increasing the shelf-life from 2 weeks to several months, respectively. Various technologies, including inductive, infrared, ohmic, dielectric, microwave, and radiofrequency heating, offer alternatives or complements to traditional thermal technologies in food processing, however, these are currently not widely used in food processing (Leong & Oey, 2022 ). Drying processes remove water from food, raw materials and ingredients to prevent the growth of bacteria, yeast, and mold (Adeyeye et al., 2022 ). Dried foods are long-lasting, versatile, and convenient. They can be directly consumed dry or rehydrated or used in recipes. Drying reduces weight and food bulkiness, offering cost-saving benefits by minimizing expenses related to packaging, handling, lower transportation volumes needed and lower energy consumption as the foods can be stored easily at ambient temperatures. Various drying technologies such as spray-, freeze- and vacuum-drying have been reviewed recently (Adeyeye et al., 2022 ). Non-thermal food processing techniques refer to methods that ensure safety and preservation of food without subjecting it to elevated temperatures. These techniques include high hydrostatic pressure, ultrasound, pulsed electric field processing, and irradiation (Jadhav et al., 2021 ). These methods provide alternative approaches to heat-based preservation techniques, aiming to maintain food quality and ensure safety. Non-thermal food processing, techniques are often applied in combination, which can raise the number of unit operations and, consequently, the consumption of natural sources (water and energy). In addition, each food matrix has a specific response to non-thermal process application. Therefore, these processes require careful control and monitoring to ensure they are effective in terms of microbial food safety, which is a major hurdle for their widespread use. The concept of multi-hurdle preservation involves the application of multiple methods to prevent the growth of microorganisms and extend the shelf life of food products (Anjaly & Shaju, 2021 ). The processes often include a combination of mild heat treatment, reducing water activity, acidification, and incorporating preservation additives to create multiple hurdles for growth of microorganisms. Multi-hurdle approaches are particularly useful for preserving complex food products with multiple potential sources of microbial contamination. In addition to preservation processes, strict hygiene standards and practices throughout the food production process, including proper hand washing and cleaning, are important for ensuring food safety. To ensure food safety, it is also important to address the presence of naturally occurring toxic chemicals in food raw materials. Various processing techniques are employed to effectively minimize their levels and ensure safety (Urugo & Tringo, 2023 ). For example, soaking and cooking are effective techniques for reducing cyanogenic glycosides in plants such as cassava, lima beans, and almonds. Similarly, the levels of solanine in potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants can be decreased by peeling and cooking. Additionally, toxic lectins found in legumes can be rendered inactive through methods like soaking, cooking, and fermentation. Furthermore, the presence of contaminant chemicals in food requires special attention. Chemical contaminants can enter into food at various stages of the food value chain, including cultivation, processing, packaging, and distribution (Rather et al., 2017 ). Cultivation can introduce contaminants such as agrochemicals (herbicides and pesticides), heavy metals (cadmium, lead, and arsenic) from the soil, and antibiotics and hormones from animal husbandry. Mycotoxins produced by fungi can contaminate grains, nuts, and dried fruits when not produced, stored, or transported properly. Food processing, whether domestic or industrial, such as frying, baking, roasting and toasting can lead to the formation of processing contaminants such as acrylamides and furans, while grilling and smoking can lead to the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Koszucka & Nowak, 2019 ). The processing conditions leading to an increased risk for processing contaminants and ways how to mitigate through formulation and process control have recently been reviewed (Meijer et al., 2021 ). Another source of contaminants is migration products from plastic packaging and printing inks (Panou & Karabagias, 2024 ). To mitigate risks from chemical contaminants, food producers and regulatory authorities implement various measures along the value chain, including good agricultural practices, proper use of pesticides and veterinary drugs, monitoring, and testing for contaminants, and setting maximum residue limits. The standard method to manage food safety is the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), which is a systematic approach that identifies, evaluates, and controls potential hazards in food production processes (Gehring & Kirkpatrick, 2020 ). To summarize, achieving an elevated level of food safety requires a collaborative effort throughout the entire food value chain.   3 Nutrition and healthy diets SDGs 2 and 3 aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition, including over and undernutrition (Fanzo, 2019 ) to ensure healthy lives, and promote well-being, as healthy individuals are essential for thriving economies. One of the key objectives of food systems is to provide access to healthy diets for all. A healthy diet is characterized by consuming a diverse range of foods that supply the necessary energy, macro- and micronutrients and adequate hydration in appropriate proportions to meet the body's energy and physiological needs (Tapsell et al., 2016 ). On the contrary, malnutrition refers to imbalances, deficiencies, or excesses in a person's intake of energy and/or nutrients. According to the WHO in 2022, there were 2.5 billion adults worldwide who were overweight, including 890 million individuals living with obesity. Additionally, 390 million individuals were underweight (Fact sheets - Malnutrition (who.int)). The numbers mentioned above underscore the substantial global burden of malnutrition leading to increased healthcare costs, diminished productivity, and impeding economic growth. Overall dietary patterns are suboptimal for many populations around the world. A recent study from Miller and coworkers (Miller et al., 2022 ) used the global Alternative Healthy Eating Index to measure diet quality. In 2018, the global score was 40.3 (out of a possible score of 100), with regional scores ranging from 30.3 in Latin America and the Caribbean to 45.7 in South Asia. Children generally had similar scores to adults. Women and more educated individuals had higher diet quality scores globally. Diet quality modestly improved between 1990 and 2018 in most regions, except for South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where no improvements were seen. They highlight insufficient consumption of healthful foods such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts, and unsaturated oils. Additionally, there are imbalances in the consumption of animal-sourced foods, with higher-income regions consuming higher amounts of meat, eggs, and dairy, while sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have inadequate consumption of high-quality protein foods. Consumption patterns are influenced by cultural habits, affordability, income, and convenience (Fan et al., 2021 ). Affordability and accessibility of nutrient-dense foods are challenging in many parts of the world (Drewnowski & Monsivais, 2020 ) and should be addressed. Food formulation and processing can be part of the solution in providing safe, nutrient-dense, affordable, and desirable foods by designing fortified (vitamins and minerals) or enriched (fibers, proteins, lipids) products with adequate shelf-life to combat nutrient deficiencies. Optimized production methods and cost-effective ingredients make such nutritious foods more affordable and appealing to consumers. 3.1 Formulation of nutrient dense foods Formulation is an essential aspect of food product development as it determines the composition of a food product, including its energy and nutrient density, by combining different ingredients in specific proportions. The goal of formulation, in combination with food processing techniques, is to achieve not only a desired nutritional value but also quality aspects such as safety and shelf life. Moreover, formulation aims to create sensory attributes that consumers find appealing, such as appearance, flavor, taste, and texture which are key drivers for food purchases (Pathania & Tiwari, 2021 ). Food formulation also considers factors like cost, regulatory compliance, and sustainability to ensure the product's viability in the market. Efforts to reformulate and improve the nutritional quality of processed foods have primarily focused on reducing or replacing sugars, salt, and saturated fats to address the negative consequences of excessive consumption of these ingredients (WHO, 2019 ). Significant efforts have been made to find healthier alternatives for these ingredients (Ponzo et al., 2021 ). Sugars, salt, and saturated fats contribute to the texture, structure, and functionality during food processing and shelf-life stability which makes it often challenging to replace them (Onyeaka et al., 2023 ), as it often leads to noticeable taste and texture differences and higher costs, which may result in consumer rejection. Therefore, it is important to implement targeted strategies that prioritize food categories where reduction has the most significant impact. For example, reducing sodium intake from table salt consumption by replacing sodium with potassium salts has been shown to be effective with demonstrated health benefits (Neal et al., 2021 ). In addition to reducing harmful ingredients, product formulation can also play a crucial role in adding positive nutrients and ingredients. This involves enriching foods with protein, fiber, and essential micronutrients to enhance their nutrient density and address the specific health needs of a population (Drewnowski et al., 2022 ). Fortifying processed foods with locally relevant nutrients and ingredients can help to improve their overall nutritional value and/or contribute to closing (micro-) nutrient gaps and thus contributing to a healthier diet.  3.2 Optimizing nutrient stability and minimizing losses in food processing Both industrial and home processing of food can have various effects on the nutrient content. Operations like cleaning, soaking, peeling, and dehulling can result in significant losses of vitamins and minerals. The application of heat during processing can lead to both quantitative and qualitative nutrient losses, with water-soluble vitamins being particularly susceptible. Undesirable reactions in proteins can occur during processing and storage, reducing their biological value and overall quality. Additionally, processing can cause nutrients to leach out of food products, impacting their final content. Nutrient losses from heat-labile vitamins and unwanted chemical reactions are more severe with longer exposure to elevated temperatures, but proper process control and formulation can help mitigate these effects (Kaur, 2023). Microencapsulation is a valuable technique for enhancing the stability and bioavailability of sensitive compounds such as vitamins, minerals, probiotics etc. Various methods like spray drying, freeze-drying, fluidized bed coating, extrusion, supercritical fluids, and electrospinning can be used for microencapsulation as recently revied (Calderon-Oliver & Ponce-Alquicira, 2022 ). These techniques offer several benefits, including improved stability, controlled release, and enhanced bioavailability of the encapsulated compounds.  3.3 Role of innovation - example of plant-based alternatives to animal-based foods Plant-based meat and dairy alternatives offer a beneficial approach to increase dietary fiber intake and decrease the consumption of saturated fats commonly found in animal-based foods. Advancements in processing plant proteins, such as soy, yellow peas, and wheat, have enabled the creation of textured plant-based foods that closely mimic the taste and texture of animal-based products. (Nikbakht Nasrabadi et al., 2021 ; Tan et al., 2021 ). Various technologies, such as high moisture extrusion, spinning, freeze structuring, and shear-cell technology, are used to achieve meat-like textures (Zahari et al., 2022 ). However, the nutritional quality of many plant sources can be impacted by the presence of allergens and antinutrients. Food allergens are present in many plant sources including nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, and others (Prager et al., 2023 ). The heat and protease resistance of certain allergens, such as storage proteins, lipid transfer proteins, and oleosins, poses a significant risk and limits their widespread use. Special consideration should be given to antinutritional factors (ANFs) such as phytates, protease inhibitors, phenolics, condensed tannins, and saponins (Samtiya et al., 2020 ). These ANFs can interfere with nutrient absorption and therefore require careful attention. They can be inactivated by employing processing methods such as soaking, dehulling, boiling, and pressure cooking, extrusion as well as germination and fermentation (Faizal et al., 2023 ). Singh and coworkers (Singh et al., 2007 ) found that Maillard (browning) reactions can potentially reduce the nutritional value of proteins when extruded. This is influenced by numerous factors, including the types of raw materials used and the specific process conditions. However, they report that mild extrusion conditions (high moisture content, low residence time, low temperature) improve the nutritional quality, while high extrusion temperatures (>200 °C), low moisture contents (<15%) and/or improper formulation (e.g., presence of high-reactive sugars) can impair nutritional quality adversely. Miller and coworkers (Miller et al., 2024 ) compared the nutritional composition of plant-based meat analogs (PBMAs) with meat and concluded that there is macronutrient equivalence with respect to proteins when choosing soy or mixtures of different plant proteins e.g. canola, pea and potato. They indicate that some commercial PBMAs lack essential minerals and vitamins like iron and vitamin B12 that are present in meat. Formulation of nutrient dense foods as described above is an effective strategy to address this shortfall. Rousseau and coworkers (Rousseau et al., 2020 ). recommend assessing the bio-accessibility and bioavailability of nutrients to accurately evaluate the nutritional value of plant-based foods and make valid comparisons with their meat or animal counterparts. Variations in nutrient content can arise not only from specific processing methods but also from factors such as different cultivars, soil quality, growing and storage conditions (Hornick, 2009 ). These factors are equally important to consider along the whole value chain when addressing the overall nutrient content of food products.  3.4 Impact of sensory on food choices Sensory drivers including taste, flavor, texture, appearance, and sound play key roles in determining our food preferences and how much we enjoy a particular food or beverage (Debnath et al., 2020 ). Food textures and flavors are generated through formulation of ingredients with specific functionalities (Table 4  ) in combination with different processing methods such as mixing, heating, emulsification, foaming, gelation, size reduction, extrusion, dehydration, carbonation, and fermentation. Heating a food can be used to provoke physical changes, such as starch gelatinization and denaturation of proteins or chemical reactions such as browning, which in turn have positive or negative effects on the sensory properties such as color, taste, and texture. Studies suggest that the texture of food also influences satiation, a feeling of fullness and satisfaction, which has a direct relationship to the amount of food consumed (Stribitcaia et al., 2020 ). Foods that are more viscous, thicker, and with more chunks have been reported to slow down consumption, making people feel full or satisfied earlier than liquid, runny, smooth, or homogenous foods (Forde & de Graaf, 2022 ; Nishinari et al., 2024 ; Teo et al., 2022 ). Oral processing characteristics related to the food matrix, such as the hardness or elasticity of solid foods increases the time food remains in the mouth, requiring more chews per bite and reducing eating rate (Bolhuis & Forde, 2020 ). In contrast, softer textures make it easier to chew and swallow, increasing eating speed. Increased eating speed, combined with other food attributes such as increased palatability, higher energy density and larger portion sizes, work synergistically to increase energy intake, and therefore pose a risk for overconsumption (Rolls et al., 2020 ). Several authors have highlighted that further research is needed to comprehensively understand the impact of texture and microstructure on energy intake and metabolic responses (Forde, 2023 ; Gibney & Forde, 2022 ; Stribitcaia et al., 2020 ).  3.5 Processing classification systems Various classification systems have been developed to assess the health impact of foods based on their level of processing (Crino, 2017 ; Sadler et al., 2021 ). Of these, the NOVA classification system is widely used in public health research. NOVA categorizes foods based on the “extent and purpose” of industrial processing into four groups as unprocessed or minimally, processed culinary ingredients, processed, and ultra-processed (Monteiro et al., 2019 ). However, there are controversies surrounding these definitions and the use of NOVA, because ‘ultra-processed food’ is ill-defined, and the classification conflates composition, number of ingredients, and processing techniques (Visioli et al., 2023 ). In addition, the use of different classification systems yields different estimates of intakes (de Araújo et al., 2022 ) and consequently, differences in risk for disease (Martinez-Perez et al., 2021 ). Despite their widespread use, there is no consensus among scientists on clear criteria for describing classification systems based on the level of food processing and its relation to health outcomes (Behsnilian et al., 2023 ; Braesco et al., 2022 ; Forde, 2023 ; Gibney, 2019 ; Katidi et al., 2023 ; O'Connor et al., 2023 ; Petrus et al., 2021 ; Sadler et al., 2021 ; Visioli et al., 2023 ). From a food technology perspective, processing level is based on the degree of processing intensity and number of process steps, which are separate from the nutritional quality of the formulation or ingredients used in food production. (Botelho et al., 2018 ). Many foods classified as “ultra-processed” are also characterized by high energy density, elevated levels of saturated fats, sodium, and/or sugars, while being low in dietary fiber, all of which are independently linked to negative health outcomes (Levine & Ubbink, 2023 ). However, studies of dietary intakes reveal that processed foods can provide both beneficial nutrients and constituents that should be limited in our diets (Lockyer et al., 2023 ; Mackerras, 2019 ; Weaver et al., 2014 ). It follows that nutrient profiling systems (Poon et al., 2018 ), which assign scores or ratings to foods based on their nutritional composition, are better suited for evaluating and categorizing the nutritional quality of foods. These systems consider various nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein, added sugars, and saturated fats. They assist consumers in selecting nutrient-rich foods aligned with dietary guidelines and support healthcare professionals, food manufacturers, and policymakers in promoting healthier eating habits and guiding food reformulation efforts (Drewnowski et al., 2021 ). As such, focusing only on degree of processing in dietary recommendations conflicts with the strong evidence for healthy diets based on food groups and nutrient composition (Amorim et al., 2022 ; Visioli et al., 2023 ).   4 Resource-efficient practices in food production SDGs 12 and 13 aim to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns while simultaneously mitigating the impacts of climate change and building resilience to its effects (Fanzo et al., 2018 ). Springmann and coworkers (Springmann et al., 2018 ) estimated that the environmental consequences related to global population and income growth, which often result in higher consumption, will increase GHG emissions by 87%, followed by the demand for cropland use by 67%, blue water use by 65%, nitrogen application by 51%, and phosphorus application by 54% from 2010 to 2050 if there are no technological advancements or focused measures to alleviate the situation. The food system is estimated to be responsible for one third of anthropogenic GHG production summing up to a total of 18 Gt CO2  equivalent (Crippa et al., 2021 ). The part attributable to food processing alone is 510 Mt of CO2  equivalent per year (21% increase since 1990) and packaging adds 310 Mt CO2  equivalent per year (87% increase since 1990) (Tubiello et al., 2022 ). The highest increase in the last 30 years was due to distribution (631%), most probably an effect of the globalization of the food value chains and fast-growing e-commerce activities. Food processing exerts both favorable and unfavorable effects on resource efficiency and the related SDGs 6, 14, and 15. Beneficial outcomes are the conservation of perishable food, thereby mitigating food waste and improving the utilization of agricultural resources. On the flip side, food processing contributes to GHGs, generates often contaminated wastewater, and produces substantial waste, including packaging materials, food scraps and other by-products. 4.1 Greenhouse gas (GHGs) reduction Different foods place varying demands on the natural systems, depending on the methods and locations of their production. For instance, animal production for meat and dairy contributes to the highest quantity of GHGs, with this contribution projected to nearly double by the year 2050 (Yitbarek, 2019 ). Consequently, countries with high animal product consumption do have a bigger impact on GHGs. According to Ivanovich and coworkers (Ivanovich et al., 2023 ), global food consumption alone has the potential to contribute almost 1 °C of warming by 2100. A sizable portion of this warming, about 75%, is attributed to the production of methane-intensive foods such as ruminant meat, dairy, and rice. However, the study suggests that more than 55% of this projected warming can be mitigated through simultaneous improvements in production practices, widespread adoption of healthy diets, and reductions in food waste at the consumer and retail levels. These findings highlight the potential for substantial climate benefits by addressing multiple aspects of the food system (Geyik et al., 2023 ). Drewnowski and coworkers (Drewnowski et al., 2015 ) have compared different foods based on their caloric energy, nutrient density, and impact on GHGs. Grains and sweets were found to have the lowest GHGs per unit mass and per unit energy, but they also had high energy density and a low nutrient content. On the other hand, animal products such as meat and dairy, which are more nutrient-dense, had higher GHGs values per unit mass but significantly lower values per unit energy. This highlights the tradeoff between nutrient density and GHGs and stresses the importance that the sustainability of alternative diets, matched for energy and nutrient adequacy can only be made based on calories and nutrient contents and not per unit mass. Ladha-Sabur and coworkers (Ladha-Sabur et al., 2019 ) reported that the most energy intense food production costs per kilogram of product were for products such as instant coffee and milk powder, fried foods, and bread, all involving thermal processes such as spray drying, roasting, frying and baking. However, energy comparisons should be made on the final product consumed, considering the costs along the whole food value chain. Long and coworkers (Long et al., 2023 ) developed an integrated approach to quantify the carbon footprint and assessed the approach on 388 recipes. They utilized Environmentally Extended Input-Output analysis, which covers the entire food supply chain from production to distribution. Additionally, they incorporated a hybrid Life Cycle Assessment to account for the cooking and disposal processes. With this holistic view, meat-based recipes with multiple ingredients had the highest GHG emissions, compared to vegetable preparations such as salads or soups, which had the lowest GHG values. Efficient energy management practices, such as optimizing equipment, improving insulation, using energy-efficient technologies, and implementing renewable energy sources, can help reduce energy consumption and minimize the environmental impact of food processing operations (Wang, 2014 ). For example, implementing waste heat recovery systems helps to improve energy efficiency in food processing (Jouhara et al., 2018 ). These systems capture and reuse waste heat generated during various processes, such as pasteurization or retorting.  4.2 Water usage It is estimated that 70% of global freshwater withdrawals are in agriculture, 19% in industry and 11% at household level (Ritchi & Roser, 2015 ). Meat and nut production are reported to have the highest water footprint (Mekonnen & Gerbens-Leenes, 2020 ). Water usage in food processing is the consumption of fresh water during the various stages of food processing and manufacturing. Water is extensively used in food processing facilities for cleaning and sanitation purposes, to prepare ingredients, like washing, soaking, or blanching, as well as in cooking and boiling processes. Water is an excellent medium for cooling purposes in cooling towers, refrigeration systems, or ice production. Furthermore, it is used in product formulation to create specific textures (Meneses et al., 2017 ). Efforts to reduce water usage in food processing include implementing water-efficient equipment, optimizing cleaning processes, as well as implementing water cleaning and circular water management systems such as membrane filtration technologies (Garnier et al., 2023 ). To use recycled water as an ingredient it must meet the standards of drinking water. Water management strategies, such as monitoring and controlling water usage, can help identify areas for improvement and reduce water waste.  4.3 Losses and waste Losses and waste are a major challenge in the global food supply chains (Parfitt et al., 2010 ; van der Werf & Gilliland, 2017 ) and SDG 12 targets to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and to reduce food loss across supply chains by 2030 (United Nations Environment Programme, 2024 ). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provides a comprehensive overview of food loss and waste (FAO, 2011 ). Food losses occur at production, postharvest and processing stages while food waste is produced at retail and final consumption. Food losses and waste refer to the reduction in mass, calories, and/or nutritional value of edible food that was originally meant for human consumption throughout the entire food value chain (Lipinski et al., 2013 ). According to United Nations data, food losses and waste account for approximately US$ 1 trillion worldwide (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021 ). FAO estimates that 14% of all food is lost and 6% wasted globally (FAO, 2019 ), resulting in 8–10% of total anthropogenic GHGs. Inappropriate management of food losses waste can cause significant environmental pollution, particularly through the production of methane during decomposition in landfills (Xue et al., 2024 ). Food production, with its diverse nature, results in losses of varying quality and quantity (Delgado et al., 2021 ). Post-harvest losses occur during storage and transportation due to infestation and decomposition of raw agricultural commodities before the food undergoes sufficient processing for extended storage. Food processing generates different side streams, such as bones, skins, and hairs from animal processing, and stems, leaves, peels, spent grains, and seed meal from plant sources during oil production (Ladakis et al., 2020 ). Some of these side streams are repurposed as animal feed. Households, the food service industry, and retailers/supermarkets contribute as well to food waste. This is linked to food spoilage, excessive purchases, overstocking, rejecting imperfect products based on ‘cosmetic’ standards and expiration date policies. These practices not only lead to economic inefficiency but also result in the loss of valuable resources. Globally, on average, 65 kg of food is wasted per year by one person with the main contributions by wasted vegetables (25%), through cereals (24%) and fruits (12%) (Chen et al., 2020 ). Daily wasted amounts of vitamin C, vitamin K, zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium are especially high, representing 25–50% of the daily dietary recommended intake (DRI) value. Meat, dairy, and eggs make a significant contribution to the wastage of essential nutrients such as calcium, choline, riboflavin, zinc, and vitamin B12. According to Eastham and Creedon there is a pressing need for a research agenda that comprehensively examines the loss of nutrient density throughout the entire food value chain (Eastham & Creedon, 2023 ). A review by Augustin and coworkers (Augustin et al., 2016 ) highlights the importance of preservation techniques in extending the shelf-life of foods. By doing so, these techniques help reduce food losses and ensure that food remains safe for consumption over longer periods. Other waste reduction strategies include improving storage and delivery techniques, optimizing production techniques for higher yields, upgrading side streams, improving distribution channels, facilitating donations of surplus food products, and promoting responsible consumer behavior. Upcycling by-products is a viable strategy to recover valuable components such as proteins, lipids, complex carbohydrates, and other beneficial compounds, and processing plays a crucial role in making these components available (Moreno-González & Ottens, 2021 ). Additionally, food waste can be utilized in many ways, such as feeding insects for protein production, animal feed and pet food (Elleby et al., 2022 ), serving as a substrate for microorganisms, producing compost for regenerative agriculture and gardening, or for biogas and fertilizer production. These successful repurposing techniques not only reduce food waste but also create new economic opportunities (Maina et al., 2017 ). Reduction of food packaging waste is another important environmental target (FAO, 2011 ). Food packaging in combination with food processing serves multiple purposes, including ensuring safety, maintaining quality, facilitating transportation and storage (Galić et al., 2011 ). It protects food from light, air, moisture, pests, bacteria, and other microorganisms that can cause spoilage. A notable example of this is the safe transportation of milk powders to regions where dairy farming is not feasible, thereby assisting these populations in enhancing their nutritional state. Technologies such as modified atmosphere packaging (Kandeepan & Tahseen, 2022 ), vacuum-sealing or active packaging technologies (Prasad & Kochhar, 2014 ) offer added value by extending shelf life, thereby increasing availability over time and space. In addition, packaging plays a critical role in controlling portion sizes, thereby helping to regulate excessive consumption and minimize waste (Livingstone & Pourshahidi, 2014 ). Plastic-based packaging materials have limitations in terms of their biodegradability, which leads to issues such as littering and microplastic pollution (Rubio-Armendariz et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, when these materials are incinerated, they contribute to CO2  emissions (Ncube et al., 2020 ). As a result, many companies are increasing their efforts in transitioning to recyclable or eco-friendly packaging solutions that are designed to have a minimal effect on the environment, be economically viable, and meet the needs of both businesses and society. This can be accomplished using renewable resources such as fiber and wood pulp for biodegradable packaging, designing recyclable materials and recycling infrastructure, while also reducing material usage and promoting reusability (Versino et al., 2023 ).  4.4 Promoting resilient food systems through protein diversity To ensure long-term sustainability, food systems must undergo a fundamental reorientation towards diversity and resilience (Zurek et al., 2022 ). While staples and animal-based foods will remain important, there is a need to shift the balance towards greater diversity on culturally relevant protein-rich food sources with lower environmental impact. Research priorities should be shifted away from staples and animal sources to explore new nutrient rich underutilized raw material solutions that positively contribute to healthier food systems (Mylan et al., 2023 ). The ongoing efforts in developing plant-based alternatives for replacing, in part, animal products, is a step in this direction (Kozicka et al., 2023 ). The current range of plant proteins used in commercial plant-based meat analogs is limited to a few plant sources only, which does not fully represent the diverse array of plant proteins available. Additional research efforts are required to advance the commercialization of new protein-rich sources and optimize production processes and sensory properties (McClements & Grossmann, 2023 ). There is a significant opportunity for innovation in improving the processability of nutrient-rich ‘whole’ raw materials, which can have dual benefits for human health and the environment by reducing losses. To address this, Schutyser and coworkers (Schutyser et al., 2015 ) have explored dry processing techniques, specifically milling combined with air fractionation, as a solvent-free method to concentrate proteins from seeds. Dry fractionation was found to be more efficient in delivering proteins compared to traditional wet fractionation methods. The dry enriched protein fractions retained their native properties and exhibited improved solubility, although they had slightly lower purity compared to conventional protein isolates. These fractions were suitable for high protein drinks. Pea fractions, when gelatinized under specific conditions, showed potential for creating structured solid protein foods as meat substitutes. However, further optimization of the dry fractionation process is necessary to fully exploit its potential. Cell-based technologies are emerging as a promising alternative to traditional animal and plant raw material production. Fermentation techniques involving fungi, algae, yeast, or bacteria are utilized to produce single cell proteins (SCP). These microorganisms are cultivated under controlled conditions and can be a valuable source of proteins for human and animal consumption (Aidoo et al., 2023 ). SCP production offers several advantages, including high protein content, rapid growth rates, efficient resource utilization, and potential for sustainable production. Another emerging technology is precision fermentation, which combines biotechnology and fermentation practices using bacteria to produce proteins, enzymes, flavors, and other valuable compounds (Augustin et al., 2023 ). Unlike traditional fermentation, precision fermentation focuses on the precise manipulation of microorganisms to produce desired specific molecules with high precision and efficiency. Cultured meat, also known as lab-grown meat, cell-based meat, or ‘clean meat’ involves the production of meat products from animal cells in a factory setting, without the need for traditional animal farming (Broucke et al., 2023 ). The process of producing cultured meat begins by obtaining a small sample of animal cells, typically through a biopsy. These cells are then placed in a culture medium that supplies the necessary nutrients for their growth and multiplication. Over time, the cells develop into tissue, which can be harvested and processed to create meat products or ingredients. All these processes offer alternative protein sources that can potentially be produced with fewer resources, lower GHGs, and reduced land and water requirements compared to conventional animal protein sources. However, there are still challenges to overcome in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and regulatory approval (Broucke et al., 2023 ; Santo et al., 2020 ). At present, there is also limited understanding of consumer acceptance and the factors that influence the consumption of products produced using these technologies (Siegrist & Hartmann, 2020 ). This knowledge is vital for developing effective strategies that can encourage consumers to try, accept, and embrace cell technology-based products.   5 Advance equitable livelihoods Advancing equitable livelihoods in food systems requires ensuring equal and fair opportunities for all individuals involved. This necessitates addressing the drivers of inequality, such as land degradation, climate change, and urbanization among others (Eliakimu & Mans, 2021 ). These function as threat multipliers, particularly for vulnerable livelihoods undercutting several SDG's by increasing the risks of poverty (SDG 1, no poverty), food insecurity (SDG 2, zero hunger) and under- and overnutrition (SDG 3, good health and well-being) (Neufeld et al., 2023 ). According to the FAO, approximately 1.23 billion people globally work in agrifood systems, and 3.83 billion people live in households connected to these livelihoods (Davis et al., 2023 ). In many low- and middle-income countries, livelihood changes involve transitioning from on-farm to off-farm activities, leading to rural-to-urban migration and increased employment opportunities in secondary towns and cities. This often results in a per capita income increase, leading to a shift in dietary patterns and changes in the structure of the food system and the broader economy (Townsend et al., 2017 ). Although urbanization can improve food systems and livelihoods, it also risks benefiting certain groups more than others (de Bruin & Dengerink, 2020 ). Low-income individuals in rural and urban areas are particularly vulnerable to rising food prices. The urban poor face limited access to healthy food, while the rural poor struggle to find employment in less labor-intensive agriculture. Failure to include the rural and urban poor in urbanization processes will undermine the achievement of SDG 2. The low productivity of the agri-food sector poses significant challenges in improving diets in low-income countries, as emphasized by Fan and coworkers (Fan et al., 2021 ). Many emerging countries primarily focus on ensuring an adequate supply of staple grains like rice, corn or wheat favoring energy rich and nutrient poor diets. As indicated by Drewnowski and coworkers (Drewnowski, 2013 ) a significant shift in the supply chain is needed, prioritizing cost-effective nutrient-rich raw materials over energy-rich alternatives. Yet, many nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and meat, are highly perishable. The absence of robust infrastructure for food preservation results in quality problems, elevated levels of food loss, and severely restricts the distribution of these foods in emerging economies, affecting both urban and rural populations (Aworh, 2021 ). To address these issues, it is crucial to support farmers with technical knowledge to improve productivity, profitability, and sustainability practices (Knickel et al., 2018 ). This can be achieved through various means, including technical training such as regenerative agricultural practices, entrepreneurship development, and financial literacy programs (Woodhill et al., 2022 ). Additionally, ensuring access to credit, removing trade barriers in international markets, developing local manufacturing and distribution infrastructures, and establishing fair prices for products are important factors to consider. Similarly, for workers, ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, social protection, opportunities for skill development, and career advancement are essential elements (Tamers et al., 2020 ). Promoting gender equality and addressing issues such as discrimination and exploitation, including child labor, are also important to advance equitable livelihoods. Materia and coworkers (Materia et al., 2022 ) emphasize the importance of traditional fermentation methods in developing markets, highlighting their potential to transform raw materials into valuable products through the action of microorganisms. These processes not only enhance food safety but also increase commercial viability, nutritional benefits, health advantages, and sensory attributes. Furthermore, small-scale fermentation projects represent a significant economic opportunity, particularly for women, due to their low barriers to entry and minimal initial investment requirements. While affordability is a crucial element in food choices among low-income populations, recent research suggests that convenience may play a significant role in food choices across all income levels, both in rural and urban areas (Herforth & Ahmed, 2015 ). Kenney and coworkers (Kenney et al., 2024 ) have conducted research on how changes in livelihoods impact food choice behaviors. They have identified several factors, including occupation, locality, time, income, and social relations, which drive changes in food choices. These factors contribute to reduced household food production, increased reliance on store-bought foods, decreased home food preparation, altered meal patterns, and increased consumption of convenience foods. These findings emphasize the significance of striking a balance between the monetary and convenience costs associated with food choices. This indicates an opportunity for the development of affordable, nutritious, and convenient food options.  6 Enablers to manage transitions towards SDGs Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the interconnections and dynamics between food systems, value chains, food processing and SDGs is vital for identifying impactful opportunities for improvement. Transforming food systems to incentivize change will not be a simple task and will necessitate significant investments and efforts of all involved actors to effectively manage the complexities and trade-offs involved. (Vågsholm et al., 2020 ). To ensure the continuous improvement of food systems' sustainability, it is crucial to monitor efforts and initiatives using widely accepted indicators that effectively measure progress towards the SDGs (Movilla-Pateiro et al., 2021 ). Whenever possible, scientifically validated methodologies should be employed to assist food producers, regulators, consumers, and other stakeholders in identifying significant food production and processing practices that drive positive transformations towards sustainable food systems. The challenge lies often in reconciling several SDGs, which can lead to trade-offs where certain goals may need to take precedence over others (Herrero et al., 2021 ). It is important to note that evaluating trade-offs are context-specific and can impact different actors along the value chain. Mausch and coworkers (Mausch et al., 2020 ) argue that the fundamental principle should always be ‘do no harm’ while trying to ensure that adjustments have the desired effects. Trade-offs should not be automatically seen as negative; rather, they indicate the need for alternative and innovative approaches. For example, efforts in developing meat and dairy alternatives offer a solution to mitigate the environmental impact associated with traditional meat and dairy production. However, this transition towards more plant-based foods may have implications for individuals employed in the traditional meat and dairy sectors. To address these concerns, exploring and adopting hybrid plant/animal approaches can be a way to mitigate the potential negative effects on these sectors. Relevant data should be collected to assess progress towards the SDGs performance indicators (Fanzo et al., 2021 ; Melesse et al., 2020 ) (Table 5  ). This may involve gathering primary data through direct measurements, surveys, interviews, or on-site evaluations, and secondary data from existing reports, databases, or industry sources. If necessary, strategies and interventions should be adjusted to optimize desired impacts and address any unforeseen risks or unintended consequences. This ensures that decisions are informed and consider the potential consequences and benefits of different approaches. 6.1 Digital technologies Digital technologies, such as sensor systems, data acquisition and management technology, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, will play a key role in managing trade-offs and improving the management of food value chains. (Konfo et al., 2023 ). Many of these applications typically have a narrow focus, addressing a single problem or optimizing a specific aspect of the overall food production process. Of particular interest to overcome this problem are digital twins which create a detailed and dynamic digital replica of a physical entity, processes, or systems, facilitating real-time monitoring, analysis, and optimization. Guidani and coworkers (Guidani et al., 2024 ) propose an approach called Agri-Food Supply Chain digital twin (AFSC-DT) that represents the entire agricultural value chain from field to consumer. This digital twin calculates various indicators, in relation to economics, planning, environment, safety, and nutrition for each food order. By integrating real-time data from various sources and simulating the behavior of the physical objects of the system, the digital twin can provide a comprehensive view of the entire value chain, allowing for better coordination and alignment across different actors (Hassani et al., 2022 ). Combining such value chain analysis with systems dynamic modeling (Allen & Prosperi, 2016 ) with SDGs in mind can provide a comprehensive understanding of system-wide consequences and trade-offs, considering both short-term and long-term dynamics. Hassoun and coworkers (Hassoun et al., 2023a ; Hassoun et al., 2023b ; Hassoun et al., 2022a ) examined the role of digital technologies within the context of Industry 4.0 innovations, which present a multitude of opportunities for the development of smart factories and smart farms. These technological advancements are capable of improving food quality, safety, and traceability, while also reducing food waste and energy consumption. Additionally, they can enable the production of novel and healthier food items, thus supporting the goals of food sustainability. The implementation of digital tools, despite their numerous benefits, faces several obstacles that must be addressed (Kosior, 2018 ). One major barrier is cost, which can be prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises. Limited access to reliable internet connectivity and technology infrastructure also hinders adoption, especially in low-and middle-income countries. Integrating digital tools into existing systems and processes can be complex, particularly when dealing with legacy systems and multiple stakeholders. Scaling up digital solutions across the value chain may present challenges in terms of compatibility, confidentiality, and coordination. Other obstacles to consider are resistance to change, concerns about data privacy, cybersecurity risks, complexities in integration, and compliance with regulations. Overcoming these hurdles requires innovative approaches, including capacity building, investment in infrastructure, addressing data interoperability, and implementing robust cybersecurity measures.  6.2 Consumer behavior Consumer behaviors play a significant role in the transition towards more sustainable food systems as choices and preferences of individuals have a direct impact on both their own nutritional intake and the environmental footprint of the food system. The consumption of food elicits a range of emotions, beliefs, desires, and moral values. Food not only satiates hunger and sustains life, but it also brings forth joy and is intertwined with cultural heritage and traditions (Amorim et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, the public lacks knowledge about contemporary food production, and as a result, misleading notions have surfaced that can distort the accurate evaluation of the advantages of food production. In present times, terms such as “ultra-processed” food are employed to refer to poor-quality and factory-made food, both of which carry negative connotations (Ares et al., 2016 ; Knorr & Watzke, 2019 ). In addition, consumers do not distinguish between diverse types of processed foods or understand processing methods. In many instances, processed food is remarkably similar to homemade food, however, developed with scientific expertise and stringent control measures to provide safe food with consistent quality and an extended shelf life (Aguilera, 2022 ; Knorr & Augustin, 2021 ). Building consumer trust in food systems is crucial for promoting sustainability and acceptance of innovative technologies (A. Hassoun et al., 2022b ; van Bussel et al., 2022 ). To achieve this, it is important to address and resolve concerns related to safety, health, and sustainability. By doing so, we can establish a solid foundation for maintaining consumer confidence, encouraging their active participation to ensure the long-term health of our food systems (Meijer et al., 2021 ). One way to enhance consumer trust is through clear and accurate food labeling. Labels should provide transparent information about the origin, composition, environmental impact, and the role of the food within a balanced diet (Meijer et al., 2023 ). Consumers should be able to recognize energy and nutrient-poor foods without labels like “processed” or “ultra-processed.” Additionally, it is crucial to avoid misleading claims and use language that is easily understandable for consumers. Price is a crucial factor in food purchasing decisions. It directly affects affordability and budget allocation for consumers and influences the perception of quality, with higher prices often associated with higher quality. Consumers may make trade-offs and opt for cheaper alternatives to stay within their budget. Price sensitivity varies among individuals, with some prioritizing low prices while others are willing to pay more for specific attributes or brands.  6.3 Cross-sector collaborations Achieving more sustainable food systems needs significant transformations throughout the entire food system. All stakeholders including governments, businesses, scientists, civil society organizations and consumers must collaborate and take action to achieve this (Clarke & Crane, 2018 ; Hansen et al., 2020 ). Bringing these groups together and finding a consensus needs innovative approaches such as the BATWOVE  model (Midgley & Reynolds, 2002 ) providing a framework to align the different interests and cut through the complexity. It considers B eneficiaries of the proposed transformation, A ctors who should make the transformation, T ransformations defining what input is changed to what output, W orldview perspectives (including values) from which the transformation looks meaningful and desirable, O wners who have the power to stop the transformation happening, V ictims who are negatively affected by the transformation and E nvironmental constraints that have to be taken as a given. Such an approach, if managed well, can facilitate knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and capacity building for the transformations needed to achieve the SDGs.  6.4 Policies and regulations The management of policy actions related to producing safe and nutritious food, resource efficiency and environmental impact and equitable livelihoods is often fragmented due to the complexity of food systems (Constas, 2023 ). However, a holistic approach to food systems requires acknowledging the interconnectedness and interdependencies among these objectives (Ruben et al., 2021 ). It is important to recognize that there are both synergies and trade-offs among these various aspects of food systems. To develop effective policy solutions, it is essential to consider these competing priorities and create coherent policies and regulations that address the multiple objectives associated with the SDGs (Jackson et al., 2020 ). This entails considering the broader impacts and interrelationships between various components of the food system, rather than treating them in isolation. The European Union's Farm to Fork Strategy is one example of an integrated policy approach to sustainable food systems, incorporating actions to reduce the environmental and climate footprint of the EU food system, addressing sustainable food production, ensuring food security, establishing a code of conduct for responsible business and marketing practices related to sustainable food processing, wholesale, retail and food services, facilitating a shift to healthy sustainable diets, reducing food waste and loss, and combatting food fraud (European Commission, 2020 ). Under the Farm to Fork strategy, a legislative framework is proposed with 27 different policy initiatives to improve sustainability related to food processing, retail, food consumption and food waste (European Commission et al., 2022 ).   7 Conclusions The importance of value chains and food processing in aligning food systems transformations with the SDGs cannot be emphasized enough. Food processing plays an indispensable role in adding value to agricultural raw materials by converting them into safe, easily storable, transportable, nutrient dense, tasty, and convenient food products that can serve the needs of individuals and communities while reducing the environmental footprint. Food processing brings many benefits, but it also poses challenges that demand increased investments. To promote healthier food choices for a broader population, it is vital to continue reformulation efforts, to reduce energy density, sugars, saturated fats, and sodium levels, while simultaneously increasing nutrient density at affordable prices, with a goal of achieving a safe, nutritious, and sustainable food supply. This includes exploring culturally acceptable new or under-utilized nutrient-rich food sources from sustainable sources. In the context of overeating, a deeper understanding of how texture and microstructure impact the speed and extent of food and energy intake and metabolic response is needed. In addition, the resource efficiency of food production practices, particularly in terms of GHGs, needs further attention. Addressing this challenge involves using renewable energy, transitioning towards higher plant protein consumption, and minimizing food losses and waste. Emerging cell-based and digital technologies are viewed as catalysts to speed up innovations needed for these transitions. Collaboration among involved stakeholders is indispensable to facilitate the development and implementation of sustainable practices. Of particular importance is the establishment of agreements based on systems perspectives, scientific data, and risk-benefit analysis to address trade-offs. Additionally, consumer behavior plays a crucial role in the adoption of sustainably produced food, and building trust through transparent communication is essential. By recognizing the role of value chains and food processing in achieving the SDGs and addressing the challenges mentioned above, we can pave the way for more sustainable and resilient food systems that effectively meet the needs of present and future generations.
