                  Assessment of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has largely focused on formulating appropriate targets and indicators for each goal. Much less attention has been devoted to estimating possible tradeoffs and complementarities in attaining the various SDGs. Yet such tradeoffs and complementarities clearly exist. We develop an analytical model to estimate the welfare effects of progress in attaining one SDG while accounting for interactions in achieving other SDGs. We assess quantitatively progress in the SDGs over 2000–2016 at the global level and for low-income countries, using a representative indicator for each goal. We then estimate the welfare changes for improvements in No Poverty (SDG1) net of any welfare gains and losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals. For the world, we estimate the per capita welfare change of reductions in 2000–2016 poverty rates net of any gains or losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals is $12,737 per capita. This is more than double the welfare change of $5671 per person for poverty reduction alone from 2000 to 2016. However, once interactions with other SDGs are taken into account, the net welfare change for poverty reduction in poor economies from 2000 to 2016 is $244 per person, which is almost 20% lower than the welfare estimate of $299 per capita of poverty reduction on its own. Such an analysis helps policy makers prioritize improvements towards one goal or set of goals, and show explicitly the net gains and losses for achieving one goal while impacting others. For example, over 2000–2016 the world may have come closer to attaining the No Poverty goal, but at the expense of other critical SDGs, especially those associated with the environment. This research has important implications for achieving sustainability through pursuit of the SDGs.

Assessment of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has largely focused on formulating appropriate targets and indicators for each goal. Much less attention has been devoted to estimating possible tradeoffs and complementarities in attaining the various SDGs. Yet such tradeoffs and complementarities clearly exist. We develop an analytical model to estimate the welfare effects of progress in attaining one SDG while accounting for interactions in achieving other SDGs. We assess quantitatively progress in the SDGs over 2000–2016 at the global level and for low-income countries, using a representative indicator for each goal. We then estimate the welfare changes for improvements in No Poverty (SDG1) net of any welfare gains and losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals. For the world, we estimate the per capita welfare change of reductions in 2000–2016 poverty rates net of any gains or losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals is $12,737 per capita. This is more than double the welfare change of $5671 per person for poverty reduction alone from 2000 to 2016. However, once interactions with other SDGs are taken into account, the net welfare change for poverty reduction in poor economies from 2000 to 2016 is $244 per person, which is almost 20% lower than the welfare estimate of $299 per capita of poverty reduction on its own. Such an analysis helps policy makers prioritize improvements towards one goal or set of goals, and show explicitly the net gains and losses for achieving one goal while impacting others. For example, over 2000–2016 the world may have come closer to attaining the No Poverty goal, but at the expense of other critical SDGs, especially those associated with the environment. This research has important implications for achieving sustainability through pursuit of the SDGs.   Keywords Low-income countries  Poverty reduction  Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Sustainability  United Nations    1 Introduction Interpretations of sustainability usually take as their starting point the consensus reached by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987), which defined sustainable development as: “Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. Our understanding of the concept of sustainable development has evolved considerably since then (Tisdell, 1988; Barbier, 1987; Lele, 1991; Anand & Sen, 2000; Barbier & Burgess, 2017 ). One of the first attempts in economics to define sustainable development was the systems approach , which characterizes sustainability as the maximization of goals across environmental, economic and social systems (Barbier, 1987; Barbier & Markandya, 2012; Ekins, 1994; Elliott, 2006; Holmberg & Sandbrook, 1992; Pezzey & Toman, 2002 ). This approach is attributed to Barbier (1987) , who identifies three systems as basic to any process of development: the environmental system, the economic system and the social system. He then argues that “the general objective of sustainable economic development, then, is to maximize the goals all these systems through an adaptive process of trade-offs” (Barbier, 1987, p. 104 ). Attempting to maximize the goals for just one system does not achieve sustainability, because the impacts on the other systems are ignored (Holmberg & Sandbrook, 1992 ). For example, achieving greater efficiency, equity and reduced poverty in economic systems may still generate unintended environmental and social impacts that undermine ecological and social systems. In 2015, the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) formally adopted “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” which provides a framework for “peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future” (UN, 2015 ). As part of this agreement, all United Nations Member States agreed upon the Sustainable Development Goals, which can be used to provide an indication and measure of progress towards the central objective of sustainable development. The SDG approach adopted by the UN fits well within the systems approach to sustainable development. There are 17 SDGs, which currently comprise 169 targets and 232 indicators. As emphasized by Sachs (2012, p. 2206) , the SDGs “aim for a combination of economic development, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion”, and thus by definition, must embrace a wide range of targets and indicators. A recent evaluation that tracks some of these indicators also stresses that the interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are critical to attaining sustainable development (UN, 2018 ). To date, quantitative assessment of the 17 SDGs has largely focused on formulating appropriate targets and indicators for each goal, designing new metrics for monitoring overall success, and collecting comprehensive and reliable data (Lu, Nakicenovic, Visback, & Stevance, 2015; Colglazier, 2015; Campagnolo, Eboli, Farnia, & Carraro, 2018; Costanza et al., 2016; Hák, Janoušková, & Moldan, 2016; Le Blanc, 2015; Reyers, Stafford-Smith, Erb, Scholes, & Selomane, 2017 ). Such progress is essential, to ensure that the proliferation of targets and indicators does not undermine the aim of the SDGs to provide a coherent framework for coordinated action across environmental, economic and social policy domains (Reyers et al., 2017 ; Dang et al., 2018). Thus, selecting appropriate indicators for each goal and evaluating the relevance of the indicators is essential to operationalizing the SDGs (Hák et al., 2016 ). Much less attention has been devoted to estimating possible tradeoffs and complementarities in attaining the different SDGs. Such an assessment is also crucial, given the emphasis on the interlinked and integrated nature of the SDGs and the need to make progress on all 17 goals to ensure sustainability (Sachs, 2012; UN, 2015, 2018 ). As the various goals include economic, social, and environmental elements, it is important to determine whether progress towards achieving one goal by 2030 will come at the sacrifice or improvement of other goals (Barbier & Burgess, 2017; Costanza et al., 2016; Gupta & Vegelin, 2016; Sachs, 2012 ). Although it may be possible to make progress across all 17 goals, it is more likely that improvement toward one SDG by 2030 may come at the expense or by aiding another goal. For example, we may have reduced poverty or hunger over recent years, but the way in which this progress has been achieved – e.g. through economic expansion and industrial growth – may have come at the cost in achieving some environmental or social goals. On the other hand, progress in reducing poverty is likely to go hand-in-hand with other important goals, such as eliminating hunger, improving clean water and sanitation, and ensuring good health and well-being. Such tradeoffs and complementarities clearly exist, as highlighted by the United Nations’ report on progress in attaining the various 2030 SDG targets (UN, 2018 ). The report notes that, since 2000, extreme poverty has continued to decline, infant and maternal mortality rates have dropped, and the proportion of the global population with access to electricity has increased. On the other hand, the per capita “material footprint” of developing countries has grown, the global share of sustainably fished stocks has declined, the Earth’s forest areas continue to shrink, and more than half of children and adolescents worldwide remain illiterate. Other studies also emphasize potential interactions among attaining different SDGS. For example, Nilsson, Griggs, and Visbeck (2016)  find that, in Sub-Saharan Africa, Zero Hunger (SDG 2) interacts positively with several other goals – including No Poverty (SDG 1), Good Health and Well Being (SDG 3) and Quality Education (SDG 4) – but interacts negatively with Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7) and Life on Land (SDG 15). Similarly, von Stechow et al. (2016)  discover possible tradeoffs between Climate Action (SDG 13) and several other SDGs. Barbier and Burgess (2017)  estimate that over 2000–2015 the world may have come closer to attaining the No Poverty, Zero Hunger, and Clean Water and Sanitation goals, but at the possible expense of other critical environmental and social SDGs. An increasing number of studies have attempted to developed to an analytical framework to formally analyze possible tradeoffs and complementarities in attaining the different SDGs in order to support decision-making. For example, Pradhan, Costa, Rybski, Lucht, and Kropp (2017)  systematically assess correlations between SDG indicators using SDG indicator data for 227 countries. They identify a statically significant positive correlation between a pair of SDG indicators as a synergy, whereas a statistically significant negative correlation between indicator pairs is classified as a trade-off. These synergies and trade-offs between SDG pairs are then ranked at the country and global scale to identify the most frequent interactions. The authors propose that this ranking can then assist in prioritizing policies to promote sustainable development. Pothen and Welsch (2019)  explore the relationship between economic growth and environmental impact, in this case materials use (represented by domestic material consumption and material footprint) for middle and low-income countries using country level data from 1990 to 2008. They show that that overall improvements in economic growth are associated with an increased use of materials and thus environmental system stress. However, more developed countries appear to have outsourced material-intensive production, and demonstrate a relative  decoupling of GDP growth and domestic material consumption. Allen, Metternicht, and Wiedmann (2019)  adopt a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) framework to assess and prioritize SDG targets, based on their ranking according to “level of urgency”, “systemic impact” and “policy gap”. Utilizing a number of approaches within the MCA framework to take account of target feedbacks and interlinkages, and mapping policy alignments and gaps, the authors show how MCA can provide an assessment approach to support national planning and reporting. Nilsson et al. (2016)  also propose mapping interactions between the 17 SDGs using a rubric for systematically assessing interactions. They establish a 7 point scale from +3 to −3 to represent the range of synergies and trade-offs between the different SDGs. These scores are then used to map interactions between the SDGs and inform decision makers of the negative and positive interactions between the SDGs. Whilst such approaches can assist in the analysis of SDG targets and indicators, the assignment of scores may be somewhat subjective and arbitrary, and weights may be required to prioritize key goals. Ivanov and Peleah (2018)  develop a conceptual framework for assessing progress towards sustainable development whilst accounting for trade-offs and complementarities based on the existing Human Development Index (HDI). The authors broaden the basic HDI index to reflect the status and process of achieving sustainable human development with respect to environmental considerations. The HDI is extended from three dimensions (i.e. health, education and living standards) to include a fourth environmental component to create a single index of a sustainable HDI. Costanza et al. (2016)  identify three broad approaches that could be applied to assess progress towards the SDGs. These are: i. production, consumption and wealth-based indicators; ii. aggregation of SDG indicators into a unit-less index; and iii. statistical analysis of SDG contributions to subjective wellbeing. The authors go on to discuss a hybrid approach to link the SDGs to a Sustainable Wellbeing Index (SWI), whilst taking account of stocks and flows of natural and social capital. The authors propose that such a hybrid model could be used to assess progress towards sustainable wellbeing. These approaches make an important contribution to our analysis of synergies and trade-offs between the SGDs and support more informed decision making. However, we take a somewhat different approach in this paper and develop an analytical model to estimate the welfare effects of progress in attaining one SDG while accounting for interactions in achieving other SDGs. We construct an analytical framework to estimate the “willingness to pay” (WTP) in dollar terms by a representative individual for an improvement in one SDG indicator, whilst taking into account possible simultaneous changes – positive or negative – in other SDG indicators. The following paper has several aims. First, we devise an analytical framework for estimating progress in attaining one SDG while accounting for interactions in achieving other goals. We base this approach on standard methods for measuring the welfare effects arising from changes in imposed quantities (Freeman, 2003; Lankford, 1988 ). Second, we apply our approach to assess progress in attaining the 17 SDGs over 2000–2016, using a representative indicator for each goal. We show that it is possible to estimate the welfare changes arising from an increase in the indicator level for one SDG, net of possible declines or improvements in the indicator associated with other goals. We use No Poverty (SDG1) as our benchmark indicator, and we estimate the per capita welfare change of reductions in 2000–2016 poverty rates net of any gains or losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals. We conduct this analysis for the world and for low-income countries. By developing a quantifiable method for gauging progress in attaining the various SDGs, our assessment provides a unique insight into the current state of the UN’s 2030 sustainability agenda. We are able to identify and measure key tradeoffs as well as important complementarities, or “win-wins”, among the SDGs as a guide to policy-making efforts directed at the environmental, economic and social “pillars” that comprise the interlinked goals of sustainability (Barbier & Burgess, 2017; Costanza et al., 2016; Reyers et al., 2017; Sachs, 2012; UN, 2015 ). In addition, by applying our analysis both globally and to low-income countries, we are able to see if there are significant differences in improving sustainability for poor economies as compared to the world as a whole. Thus, our approach is a significant contribution to assessing possible tradeoffs and synergies in achieving the 17 SDGs, which is essential for evaluating progress towards the UN’s 2030 sustainability agenda (Nilsson et al., 2016; UN, 2018; von Stechow et al., 2016 ). Our paper is structured as follows. Section 2  provides a brief overview of the 17 UN SDGs and identifies a representative indicator for each goal. Using these indicators, we conduct a quantitative assessment of current progress over 2000–2016 for each of the 17 SDGs. In the following section, we develop a method for measuring the welfare changes in one representative SDG indicator, while accounting for the gains and losses arising from interactions with another indicator. In Section 4 , we apply this approach to the changes in SDG indicators over 2000–2016, for both all the countries in the world and in low-income economies. We conclude our paper by discussion the implications of our results for policy and identifying further research steps.  2 Progress in attaining the sustainable development goals (SDGs) Assessing progress in attaining the SDGs is challenging, in part because there is no single universally accepted data source representing each of the 17 SDGs. In the absence of such data, it is difficult to choose an appropriate indicator, or group of indicators, for each goal and access reliable data for that indicator or group. As noted by Jacob (2017) , establishing a representative performance measurement system for the SDGs is important to ensure effective analysis and evidence-based policy making. Selecting any one indicator, or a combination of indicators, from the range of indicators available to reflect the performance of a single SDGs is problematic, and any analysis of the chosen indicator will only reflect that specific aspect of the broader SDG. For example, the United Nation provides several indicators for each SDG (UN, 2019 ). In the case of SDG 2 Zero Hunger whose target description is to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture” there are numerous indicators listed (UN, 2019 ). However, there is little comprehensive data on the majority of these indicators in the United Nations SDG database. The World Bank also lists several indicators for SDG 2 and the target of Zero Hunger and provides data for some of these indicators, drawn from the World Development Indicators Database (World Bank, 2019 ). Table 1   depicts the 17 SDGs of the 2030 agenda (UN, 2015 ) along with a brief description associated with the overall target for each goal, and our choice of representative indicator. As we have noted previously, there are several possible indicators for each SDG. However, not all indicators are supported with adequate time series data from 2000 to 2016, especially for low-income countries. As far as possible, we have chosen the primary indicator listed by the UN (2015)  for each goal. While our chosen indicators are representative of each specific SDG objective, we acknowledge that selecting other indicators could result in different estimates and outcomes. This should be explored further, once better indicators and time series data are available for each SDG. The data for each of our representative SDG indicators are taken from the World Bank Sustainable Development Goals database, which provides a relatively complete and reliable set of data at the country level for our chosen indicators. The data were selected to ensure adequate coverage globally and for low-income countries over 2000–2016. Using the representative indicator for each goal depicted in Table 1 , it is possible to conduct a quantitative assessment of current progress over 2000–2016 for each of the 17 SDGs. This assessment is applied to all countries of the world and to low-income countries, which are economies in which 2017 per capita income was $1005 or less. We estimate both actual changes in value in the original units of each indicator from 2000 to 2016, and also the percentage change in these values over this period, using averages derived at the world and low-income country level. Based on the latter change, we then assess whether the representative indicator for each of the 17 SDGs has been improving or declining over 2000–2016. Measuring social and economic progress towards the SDGs by calculating percentage changes in the selected indicators can vary depending on whether the progress is measured in absolute or relative terms, is based on change rather than level targets, consists of positive versus negative indicators, or is a combination of these factors (Easterly, 2009 ). As noted by Easterly (2009) , measures of progress can appear to have very different outcomes depending on type of measure used. In our analysis, we combine information on the absolute change in actual indicator value with percentage change in these values to assess whether the outcome with respect to that indicator, and thus the SDG target, has been improving or declining. Table 2   depicts the results of this analysis for the world and low-income countries. The benchmark indicator in our analysis is SDG 1 No Poverty. The analysis could also be replicated with other SDGs as the benchmark indicator, depending on the priority of country. For example, some countries may prioritize other goals, such as SDG 8: Good jobs and economic growth, or SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions, and so on. However, in the absence of knowing which SDG is a priority, and given that priorities will differ across countries and over time, we have selected one indicator to provide a representative scenario for our analysis. The representative indicator for SDG 1 No Poverty is the poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) as a percentage share of total population, and the UN target is to ensure that this ratio is effectively zero for all countries by 2030. Table 2  indicates that the poverty headcount ratio has declined significantly across the world, from 20.8% in 2000 to 3.0% in 2016, which amounts to a fall in poverty rates of 85.5%. For low-income countries, extreme poverty rates have also fallen, from 81.3% in 2000 to 28.1% in 2016, which is a decline of 65.4%. Thus, both across the world and in low-income countries, the representative indicator is improving over 2000–2016, suggests that we are making progress in attaining SDG 1 No Poverty. Table 2  shows that ten other SDG indicators have also improved over 2000–2016 for the world, i.e. the indicators for SDG 2 Zero Hunger, SDG 3 Good Health and Well Being, SDG 4 Quality Education, SDG 5 Gender Equality, SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, and SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals. However, six SDG indicators have declined over 2000–2016, i.e. the indicators for SDG 8 Good Jobs and Economic Growth, for SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 13 Climate Action, SDG 14 Life Below Water, SDG 15 Life on Land, and SDG 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. A similar pattern of improvement and decline in SDG indicators over 2000–2016 emerges for low-income countries, with some exceptions. For poor economies, the indicator for SDG 13 Climate Action has improved, whereas the indicators for SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities and SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production declined from 2000 to 2016. Based on the assessment in Table 2 , the bar graphs in Figs. 1 and 2    rank the percentage change in SDG indicator levels over 2000–2016, from the largest gains to the biggest declines, for the world and low-income countries respectively. In these figures, all improving indicators in Table 2  are assigned positive values, and all declining indicators are given negative values. As depicted in Fig. 1 , for the world, the largest gains over 2000–2016 occurred in indicators for SDG 1 No Poverty (85.5%), followed by SDG 5 Gender Equality (77.0%) and SDG 17 Partnership for the Goals (40.1%). The greatest declines were in indicators for SDG 8 Good Jobs and Economic Growth (−52.0%), SDG 14 Life Below Water (−49.1%) and SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (−11.8%). As shown in Fig. 2 , for low-income countries, large gains occurred over 2000–2016 in indicators for SDG 5 Gender Equality (96.9%), SDG 1 No Poverty (65.4%), SDG 3 Good Health and Well Being (60.8%), SDG 17 Partnership for the Goals (58.5%), and SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy (44.8%). There were also significant declines in indicators for SDG 8 Good Jobs and Economic Growth (−146.7%), SDG 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (−65.6%), and SDG 14 Life Below Water (−46.5%). Two goals that exhibited an improvement at the world level but declined at the low-income country level are SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production and SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities. In contrast, SDG 13 Climate Action declined at the world level but showed an improvement at the low-income country level. In sum, our quantitative assessment of changes in representative SDG indicators from 2000 to 2016 identifies a number of possible tradeoffs and complementarities in attaining the various SDGs. Overall, it appears that progress has occurred simultaneously towards goals that are largely associated with “economic” or “social” aims (e.g. SDGs 1–7, 10 and 17), whereas there has been less success in attaining “environmental” goals (e.g. SDGs 11–15). Based on the declines in the indicators for SDG 8 and SDG 10, and in SDG 12 for low-income countries, there should also be concern about the “sustainability” of some of the economic progress that has occurred from 2000 to 2016. The current decline in environmental goals may constrain or undermine progress on achieving improvements in economic and social goals in the future. In addition, some SDG indicators have declined significantly for low-income countries (e.g. SDGs 8, 12, 16, 14, 9, 15 and 11) compared to all countries in the world (see Figs. 1 and 2 ). These large declines suggest that progress in reducing poverty and complementary improvements in other important SDGs in poor economies may have come at large tradeoffs in terms of attaining other goals that are essential to the sustainability of these economies.  3 Material and methods: assessing interactions among different SDGs In addition to identifying possible tradeoffs and complementarities in attaining the different SDGs and quantifying the magnitude of these changes, it would also be useful to estimate the welfare implications of these changes. A standard method in economics for addressing such a welfare effect is to estimate the “willingness to pay” (WTP) by a representative individual for an improvement in one SDG indicator, taking into account possible simultaneous changes – positive or negative – in other SDG indicators. By adopting standard methods from the theory of choice and welfare under imposed quantities (Freeman, 2003; Lankford, 1988 ), we show that is possible to measure the welfare effects of an increase in one SDG that takes into account any interactions with any other SDG.1 Note that, as an economy strives to fulfill one or more SDG, there may be relative price effects, so that the price p  of the composite marketed good x  might change. To keep the following welfare analysis uncomplicated, we have assumed relative prices to be unchanged, which is a standard assumption in economic models of choice and welfare under imposed quantities.  1   Here, we outline the key elements of our analytical approach. Assume that there are a large number of individuals in an economy, and each individual consumes a single composite good x  that has a market price p . A representative (i.e. average) individual will choose to allocate his or her income M  to purchase this marketed good. Suppose that, at the time of the individual’s allocation decision, the economy has achieved predetermined indicator levels for n  different SDGs. For example, in our analysis, the indicator level would be the prevailing level in 2000 for each of the SDG indicators listed in Table 1 . Although the welfare of the individual is affected by the economy-wide initial SDG indicator levels, from the individual’s point of view, the most important characteristic of these SDG levels is that they are available only in fixed, unalterable quantities. The individual may be able to choose how much of the marketed good to consume but not the SDG indicator levels of the entire economy. Let the vector s = s 1  , . . . , s n     represent the currently attained indicator levels of the n  SDGs. The representative individual will choose the amount of x  to consume that minimizes total expenditure px = M    subject to the constraint that his or her utility is equal to or exceeds a given initial level u 0 . From the standpoint of the individual, as the vector s  is constant, then the first-order condition u x ; s     = u 0     is sufficient to solve for the optimal compensated demand for the marketed good x ∗  = x ∗  s , u 0        , which is conditioned on the initial indicator levels of all SDGs as represented by s . Substituting the latter expression into the expenditure function px  yields the corresponding conditional expenditure function(1) E ∗  = E ∗  p , s , u 0      ,   s = s 1  , . . . s i  , s j  s i     , . . . s n      The conditional expenditure function E * indicates the minimum expenditure that the individual needs to obtain the optimal amount of the marketed good consumed x *, given its price p , initial utility level u 0  and the currently attained SDG indicator levels s . Note that the expression for s  in (1)  allows for the possible interaction between two SDG indicators, si   and sj  . Although a change in the indicator level si   of the i th SDG will have a direct impact on the conditional expenditure of the representative individual, the term s j  s i        implies that there may also be a possible interaction between any change in the indicator level of the i th goal and the level of the j th SDG. For example, as discussed above, progress towards attaining No Poverty (SDG 1) could also spur improvement towards other goals, such as Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Good Health and Well Being (SDG 3) and Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6), but come at the expense of some social and environmental SDGs, such as Climate Action, Life on Land, or Reduced Inequalities. Such interactions among SDGs can now be explicitly accounted for in the welfare measurement of a change in the indicator level si   associated with the i th SDG. Suppose now that there is a change in si  , from an initial level s i 0     to some final level s i 1    . The welfare change is the total amount of expenditure on x  that the individual is willing to pay for this improvement in the SDG indicator level. Using (1) , this compensating surplus (CS) measure of the welfare gain can be represented as(2) CS   = M - E ∗  p , s i 1  , s j  s i 1     , u 0      = Δ E ∗  s i     - Δ E ∗  s j  s i             where Δ E ∗  s i        is the reduction in expenditure on x  to compensate directly for an increase in si   and Δ E ∗  s j  s i            is the additional change in the expenditure on the marketed good that is necessary to compensate for any possible interaction between si   and sj  . Thus, the compensating surplus CS measure in (2)  represents the true willingness to pay of the individual for an improvement in si  , as it is net of any corresponding improvement or decline in sj  . To facilitate measurement, it may be convenient to approximate (2)  by(3) CS = Δ E ∗  s i     - Δ E ∗  s j  s i         ≈ Δ s i  ± Δ s j      E ∗      where E * is some numeraire measure of income, Δ s i     is the percentage gain in the indicator level for the i th SDG, and Δ s j     is the percentage change in the indicator level sj   of any other SDG that is affected by any possible interaction with si  . Equation (3)  confirms that any measurement of the willingness to pay for an improvement in the indicator si   for the i th SDG must take into account any other SDG indicator sj   is affected. For example, in the case where there is no interaction between the two indicators, then Δ s j  = 0    and CS = Δ s i  E ∗    . However, if sj   declines as si   improves, then the compensating surplus measure is CS = Δ s i  - Δ s j      E ∗    . If both indicators improve, then the willingness to pay is CS = Δ s i  + Δ s j      E ∗    . That is, the representative individual’s willingness to pay for an improvement in si   should be approximated by CS = Δ s i  E ∗     only if there is no corresponding change in any other SDG indicator sj  . If instead sj   declines (improves), then Δ s i  E ∗     overstates (understates) the willingness to pay for the improvement in si   and must be adjusted downwards (upwards) to obtain the true CS measure. Fig. 3   illustrates graphically these three possible outcomes for an increase in an SDG indicator. The figure is drawn with the assumption that the price of the marketed good x  is normalized to one (p  = 1). Point A represents the initial starting point before the change in the i th SDG indicator. If there is no corresponding impact on any other SDG indicator, then Δ s j  = 0    and an increase in the level of si   leads to a rise in the individual’s utility to u 1  (point B). The reduction in expenditures (income) Δ s i  E ∗     necessary to compensate directly for the rise in si   measures the welfare gain, which is equivalent to distance BC . However, if there is a tradeoff with another SDG indicator sj  , then Δ s i  E ∗     overstates the net welfare gain for the rise in si  . As shown in the figure, the effect of the tradeoff is that the individual’s utility rises to u 2 , but this level is less than u 1  (point D). The individual requires additional income to compensate for the fall in sj.   The true willingness to pay is thus net of this tradeoff Δ s i  - Δ s j     E ∗    . Finally, if the improvement in si   is complemented by a rise in sj  , then Δ s i  E ∗     understates the net welfare gain. Because of the improvement in sj  , the individual reaches an even higher utility level u3   than u 1  (point E), and the individual would be willing to pay more for this additional benefit. The net welfare gain should now be Δ s i  + Δ s j     E ∗    .  4 Results The welfare analysis that we have developed can be applied to the quantitative assessment of the net changes in SDG indicators over 2000–2016 presented in Table 2 . As we discussed in Section 2 , the choice of representative indicator and data source for each SDG can significantly affect the results of such an analysis. As far as possible, we have chosen the primary indicator listed by the UN (2015)  for each goal. The data for each of our representative SDG indicators are taken from the World Bank Sustainable Development Goals database to ensure adequate coverage globally and for low-income countries over 2000–2016 period. It should be noted that selecting other indicators, data sources and timeframes could result in different estimates of the welfare effects of progress in attaining one SDG while accounting for interactions in achieving other SDGs. We use No Poverty (SDG1) as our benchmark indicator, and we estimate the per capita welfare change of reductions in 2000–2016 poverty rates net of any gains or losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals. We conduct this analysis for the world and for low-income countries in order to provide a representative scenario. Our analysis could be replicated with any other SDG as the benchmark indicator, depending on the SDG of interest. We choose the world’s adjusted net national income (ANNI) per capita in 2000 (constant 2010 US$) as a proxy for the (Hicksian) income necessary to compensate the average individual in the global economy for a change in the indicator level of any SDG. As shown by Arrow, Dasgupta, Goulder, Mumford, and Oleson (2012) , and initially by Weitzman (1976) , national income that accounts for the net depreciation of an economy’s natural, human and reproducible capital is a measure of the sustainable income generated each year by the economy. According to the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, adjusted net national income is gross national income (GNI) minus consumption of fixed capital and net depletion of natural resources.2 See http://databank.worldbank.org/data/ .  2   Although it does not include net changes in human capital, nor critical components of the environment such as ecosystems or ecological capital, ANNI serves as an approximate measure of sustainable income that the average individual would be willing to pay for an improvement in the level of any SDG.3 For illustrations of how the adjusted net national income approach could be extended to include loss and degradation of ecological capital, and thus serve as a better measure of sustainability and welfare, see Barbier (2013)  and (2016) .  3   For our analysis of all countries globally, we use world ANNI per capita (constant 2010 US$) in 2000, which is $6635. For low-income countries, ANNI per capita in 2000 is $456. Using ANNI per capita in 2000 as our numeraire allows us to assume that an individual would be willing to pay $1 of this sustainable income for a 1% improvement in the indicator for the No Poverty goal from 2000 to 2016. Based on Eq. (3) , the estimate of the willingness to pay for the improvement in this indicator would be CS = Δ s i  E ∗    , where Δ s i     is the percentage gain in the indicator level for the No Poverty Goal over 2000–2016, and E * is the numeraire of ANNI per capita in 2000. If another SDG indicator also improves over 2000–2016, then the representative individual would be willing to pay $1 of this sustainable income for a 1% improvement in the indicator. Based on Eq. (3) , if si   and sj   improve together, then the net WTP becomes CS = Δ s i  + Δ s j      E ∗    , where + Δ s j     is the percentage gain in the other SDG indicator over 2000–2016. However, if another SDG indicator declines from 2000 to 2016, then the individual would accept an additional $1 ANNI to compensate for the tradeoff of a 1% loss in this indicator. From Eq. (3) , if there is a tradeoff between si   and sj  , then the net WTP is CS = Δ s i  - Δ s j      E ∗    , where - Δ s j     is now the percentage decrease in the other SDG indicator over 2000–2016. Table 3   depicts the results of this analysis applied at the world level. The first row shows that, in the absence of tradeoffs or complementarities with attaining any other SDG, the willingness to pay for the reduction in poverty in the world economy that occurred over 2000–2016 was $5671 per person. Over this period, indicators for ten other SDGs also improved. Our analysis shows that the WTP for the total gains from these additional improvements amount to an additional $15,564 per capita. However, over 2000–2016, the indicators for six SDGs declined, and the welfare estimate of these total losses is $8499. Thus, for the world, we estimate the per capita welfare change of reductions in 2000–2016 poverty rates net of any gains or losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals is $12,737 per capita. This is more than double the welfare change of $5671 per person for poverty reduction alone from 2000 to 2016. Table 4   shows the results of our welfare analysis for low-income countries. The willingness to pay for the reduction in poverty that occurred over 2000–2016 in these poor economies is estimated to be $299 per person, which is considerably lower than the comparative figure of $5671 per person at the world level. This benefit is complemented by improving indicators for nine other SDGs, which lead to total welfare gains of an additional $1527 per person. However, the latter gains are more than cancelled out by the welfare losses associated with the decline in seven SDG indicators for low-income countries over 2000–2016, which amount to $1582 per person. Overall, once these interactions are taken into account, the net welfare change for poverty reduction in poor economies from 2000 to 2016 is $244 per person. This is almost 20% lower than the welfare estimate of $299 per capita of poverty reduction on its own. In sum, the analysis we have developed in this paper demonstrates that it is possible to estimate the welfare effects of possible complementarities and tradeoffs among achieving more than one SDG, when such goals are considered to be interlinked and essential to achieving sustainable development (Sachs, 2012; UN, 2015 , 2018). Such an analysis can help policy makers prioritize improvements towards one goal or set of goals, and above all, to show explicitly that there are consequences in terms of net gains and losses for achieving one goal at the possible expense of others. For example, for both the world and low-income countries, the gains for reductions in poverty are complemented equally if not more by gains from improvements in SDG 5 Gender Equality. The main tradeoff appears to be welfare losses with respect to SDG 8 Good Jobs and Economic Growth, as measured by annual growth in ANNI from 2000 to 2016. We find that there are considerable differences in the welfare effects of interactions among the SDGs for low-income countries as opposed to the world. As Table 3  shows, although there are some welfare losses through tradeoffs with declining SDG indictors over 2000–2016, in the global economy these losses are more than compensated by gains in other SDG indictors. As a result, for the world, once these interactions are taken into account, the welfare change for poverty reduction over 2000–2016 increases from $5671 to $12,737 per person. But for low-income countries, the tradeoffs from declining SDG indicators almost cancel out the welfare gains from improving indicators over 2000–2016 (see Table 4 ). Consequently, for poor economies, these interactions mean that the welfare change for poverty reduction over 2000–2016 decreases from $299 to $244 per person. The results of our analysis, in terms of synergies and trade-offs between SDG 1 No Poverty and the other SDGs are supported by the existing literature. For example, in their pair-wise analysis of 122 SDG indicators for 227 countries between 1983 and 2016, Pradhan et al. (2017)  observe positive correlations between SDG 1 No Poverty and SDG 3 Good Health and Wellbeing, SDG 4 Quality Education, SDG 5 Gender Equality, SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation and SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities. Negative correlations are recorded between SDG 1 No Poverty and SDG 8 Good Jobs and Economic Growth, SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure and SDG 15 Life on Land.  5 Conclusion To date, assessment of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has largely focused on formulating appropriate targets and indicators for each goal. Establishing a reliable performance measurement system for the SDGs is important to ensure effective evidence-based policy making (Jacob, 2017 ). However, much less attention has been devoted to analyzing the performance measures and, in particular, estimating possible tradeoffs and complementarities in attaining the various SDGs. Yet, such an analysis could prove crucial to policy-making efforts directed at the environmental, economic and social “pillars” that comprise the interlinked goals of sustainability (Barbier & Burgess, 2017; Costanza et al., 2016; Reyers et al., 2017; Sachs, 2012; UN, 2015 ). In this paper, we have developed one approach for conducting such an assessment. By adopting standard methods to estimate welfare changes under imposed quantities (Freeman, 2003; Lankford, 1988 ), we show that is possible to measure the welfare effects of an increase in the indicator level for one SDG whilst taking into account any tradeoffs or complementarities with achieving other SDGs. We then conduct a quantitative assessment of progress over 2000–2016 for each of the 17 SDGs, using a representative indicator for each goal. The selection of alternative SDG indicators, data sources and timeframes is expected to result in different estimates of such welfare effects. Overall, the indicator levels associated with most of the SDGs have improved, both for the world and low-income countries. We note two concerns with the latter tradeoffs. First, most of declining indicators are associated with “environmental” goals (e.g., SDGs 11–15). Second, there should also be concern about the “sustainability” of some of the economic progress that has occurred from 2000 to 2016, especially for low-income countries, which have experienced large declines over this period in indicators for SDG 8 Good Jobs and Economic Growth, SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, and SDG 14 Life Below Water. The decline in these environmental goals may constrain or undermine progress on achieving improvements in other economic and social goals in the future (Costanza et al., 2016; Gupta & Vegelin, 2016 ). The first SDG listed by United Nations (UN) (2015)  is No Poverty, and the indicator for this goal has shown considerable progress between 2000 and 2016 for both the world and for low-income countries. We therefore employed our welfare analysis to estimate preliminary welfare effects of the increase in the indicator level for the No Poverty goal, both without and with possible interactions with indicators for other SDGs over 2000–2016. Our results show important similarities and differences between the welfare effects for the world as opposed to poor economies. For both the world and low-income countries, the gains for reductions in poverty are complemented equally if not more by gains from improvements in SDG 5 Gender Equality. Equally, the main tradeoff appears to be welfare losses with respect to SDG 8 Good Jos and Economic Growth, as measured by annual growth in ANNI from 2000 to 2016. However, whereas for the world, the improvements in SDG indicators more than offset the decline in other indictors over 2000–2016, they almost cancel out for poor economies. As a result, for the world, once these interactions are taken into account, the welfare change for poverty reduction over 2000–2016 increases from $5671 to $12,737 per person. But for poor economies, these interactions mean that the welfare change for poverty reduction over 2000–2016 decreases from $299 to $244 per person. Several implications for policy emerge from this analysis. First, reducing poverty and improving other important social and economic SDGs over 2000–2016 may have come at the expense of making our economies less sustainable, especially with respect to “environmental” goals, such as SDGs 11–15. Lack of progress in attaining any one of these latter goals, such as climate action, may on its own be sufficient to constrain future progress towards all other SDGs goals. Second, low-income countries should be a priority in policy efforts to improve global sustainability. As our analysis shows, the SDG indicators that improved for poor economies over 2000–2016 generally increased less than for the world. However, the declines in SDG indicators were substantially much larger for low-income countries, and the aggregate effect of the interactions across all SDGs was to lower the net benefits from reducing poverty. Thus, future policies should focus on the specific sustainability challenges faced by poor economies in implementing the 2030 sustainable development agenda. Third, although our analysis shows that there has been considerable poverty reduction since 2000, recent assessments by the United Nations (UN) (2018)  indicate that, at the global level, poverty reduction rates have slowed while the number of malnourished have risen from 775 million people in 2015 to 815 million in 2016. Thus, it is important to revise and update the analysis developed here, to better inform decision makers of the changing interactions in progress towards various SDGs. Finally, high rates of natural capital depreciation appear to be a major concern for low-income countries, as the high welfare losses attributed to declining growth in ANNI per capita and adjusted net savings rates in poor economies are largely due to rapid depletion of valuable natural resource endowments. The long-run natural capital depreciation has averaged 6.9% for low-income countries over 1974–2014, and since the mid-2000s has risen from 8 to 9% to around 13–15% (Barbier, 2019 ). A key focus of policies should be to improve the efficiency and sustainability of natural resource use to reduce this excessive natural capital depreciation. In addition, low-income countries need to save and invest more natural resource revenues, through appropriate use and management of financial vehicles, such as natural resource-based sovereign wealth funds (Barbier, 2019; Venables, 2016 ). The quantitative assessment and welfare analysis developed here will benefit from continued progress in formulating better indicators for each goal, and designing new metrics for monitoring overall success (Campagnolo et al., 2018; Costanza et al., 2016; Hák et al., 2016; Le Blanc, 2015; Reyers et al., 2017 ). In addition, given the impacts of limited data availability on such assessment and analysis, it is crucial that funding for improved data collection and compilation is prioritized to support efforts to monitor progress towards the SDGs. For example, for some of the SDGs, it was difficult to find an appropriate representative indicator that also had sufficient coverage of countries over the time span of the analysis from 2000 to 2016. As the range, quality and coverage of indicators improve, the approach developed here could provide a more robust analysis of progress in attaining the SDGs, including incorporating several different indicators for each SDG. It would also be of interest to conduct the analysis for specific regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa (e.g. Nilsson et al., 2016 ), or to focus on a different benchmark indicator, such as SDG 13 Climate Action (e.g. von Stechow et al., 2016 ). Finally, the type of quantitative assessment and welfare analysis across interlinking goals and impacts developed here may be applicable to other policy areas. There is a growing scientific literature emphasizing that human populations and economic activity are rapidly exceeding “planetary boundaries”, which could lead to abrupt phase changes, or “tipping points” (Lenton et al., 2008; Rockström, 2009; Steffen, 2015 ). Crossing these boundaries may lead to irreversible and irrevocable damage to major Earth systems, such as climate, global pollution sinks, biodiversity and natural areas; consequently, associated with these boundaries, are a “safe operating space for humanity”, which places limits on how much economic activity can exploit the global biophysical subsystems or processes. Griggs et al. (2013) propose that sustainable development in the Anthropocene should be defined as “development that meets the needs of the present while safeguarding Earth’s life-support system, on which the welfare of current and future generations depends”. To date, this scientific literature has focused on characterizing boundaries rather than suggesting “how to maneuver within the safe operating space in the quest for global sustainability” (Steffen, 2015 ). However, increasingly economists have argued that recognition of the joint interaction of economic and environmental systems in determining market and nonmarket outcomes is essential to developing models that inform stewardship of this “safe operating space” (Smith, 2017 ). Improved welfare analysis of the tradeoffs among system goals will be even more critical for the policy choices needed for such stewardship within critical and binding constraints. The protection of essential environments that may be subject to irreversible conversion could require the implementation of policy approaches such as precautionary approaches and safe minimum standards (Tisdell, 1988 ), as well as efforts at the international level to invest in global public environmental goods, such as biodiveristy (Barbier et al., 2018 ). Overall, progress has occurred simultaneously towards goals that are largely associated with “economic” or “social” aims, whereas there has been less success in attaining “environmental” SDGs. The decline in environmental goals may constrain or undermine progress towards achieving sustainable development (Tisdell, 1988; Barbier, 1987; Lele, 1991; Anand & Sen, 2000 ), even with improvements in economic and social goals in the future (Griggs et al., 2013; Gupta & Vegelin, 2016; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). The next step is to move forward from monitoring, measuring and analyzing the SDG indicators to utilizing the information provided by this research to create appropriate incentives for policies that support progress towards sustainable development at the international, national and local level.
