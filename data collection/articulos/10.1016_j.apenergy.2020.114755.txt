                  This article introduces the SDG-9 index as a measure of country progress towards achieving industry-related targets of Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG-9). The SDG-9 index represents a comprehensive but straightforward approach to assess the extent to which countries have industrialized while promoting social inclusiveness and minimizing natural resource use and environmental impacts. The selection of indicators is based on the global indicator framework for the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The resulting SDG-9 index benchmarks inclusive and sustainable industrial development in 128 economies over the period 2000–2016. In general, industrialized economies outperform other countries, with the top five leading the 2016 ranking being Ireland, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Japan. The calculated scores of the SDG-9 index can show in which dimensions countries represent the leaders or lag behind other economies. Thus, the SDG-9 index forms a valuable tool for policy makers and analysts.

This article introduces the SDG-9 index as a measure of country progress towards achieving industry-related targets of Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG-9). The SDG-9 index represents a comprehensive but straightforward approach to assess the extent to which countries have industrialized while promoting social inclusiveness and minimizing natural resource use and environmental impacts. The selection of indicators is based on the global indicator framework for the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The resulting SDG-9 index benchmarks inclusive and sustainable industrial development in 128 economies over the period 2000–2016. In general, industrialized economies outperform other countries, with the top five leading the 2016 ranking being Ireland, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Japan. The calculated scores of the SDG-9 index can show in which dimensions countries represent the leaders or lag behind other economies. Thus, the SDG-9 index forms a valuable tool for policy makers and analysts.

Industrialization is a dynamic economic process that generates income and employment, facilitates trade and promotes efficient resource use. Although the world is facing climate change challenges, industrial development still remains a major driver of poverty alleviation and shared prosperity [2] . Through innovation and technological progress, ISID contributes to reaching environmental objectives, such as greater resource and energy efficiency [3] . Improving energy efficiency in industry is one of the most cost-effective measures to help supply-constrained developing and emerging countries meet their increasing energy demands and loosen the link between economic growth and environmental degradation, such as climate change [4] . Although industrialization contributes to economic growth, its impact differs depending on the country’s stage of development [5] . Industrial growth in developed economies will largely depend on the level of adoption of new technologies, intelligent production processes and on limiting the impact of industrial production on the local natural environment and the global climate [6] . For developing economies, industrialization implies structural transformation of the economy from traditional sectors such as agriculture and fishery to a modern manufacturing industry based on innovation and technology [7] . Such an expansion of the manufacturing sector creates jobs, helps reduce income poverty, introduces and promotes new technologies and produces essential goods and services for the market [8] . Manufacturing emissions largely result from energy generation – directly through fossil fuel combustion or indirectly through electricity use. As lower middle-income countries typically have the highest emissions intensities due to the technologies used and the type of production [9] , sustainable industrialization paths are particularly relevant to these countries’ development paths [10] . On 25 November 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” [11] . The 2030 Agenda calls for collaborative partnerships on all levels and emphasizes the achievement of sustainable development for all by building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”. The new Goals and targets, known as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), came into effect on 1 January 2016, becoming the main reference point for development policies to foster sustainable development in all dimensions – economic, social and environmental – until 2030. ISID is recognized under Goal 9, calling for “Building resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”. The 2030 Agenda provides a multidimensional view of development resulting in possible synergies or trade-offs among the 17 Goals, for instance, ISID as potential synergy with the target 7.3 on energy intensity [12] . Hence, achieving the SDGs will require profound structural changes across all segments of society [13] . A comprehensive assessment of global sustainability must not only consider economic stability and environmental integrity but also the social equity of well-being, which will ensure lasting prosperity for all people on the planet [14] . Rapid population growth in the Global South and increasing pressure on the environment are the two major challenges for global development. Economic development is closely linked with energy consumption and thus a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions [15] . However, the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions is very costly and might not be affordable for developing countries as it relies on extensive investments in low-carbon climate-resilient industrial infrastructure and production technologies. Some energy sustainability strategies call for building an energy-efficient society by reducing energy requirements in industrial production, and thus slowing down the increase in global energy consumption [16,17] . Energy decarbonization and sustainable industry has been identified as one of the six key transformations that need to take place to achieve the SDGs. Three aspects are highlighted – decarbonization of electricity generation by shifting from fossil fuels to zero-carbon sources, improving energy efficiency in final energy use and electrification of current uses of fossil fuels outside power generation [13] . These environmental objectives remain crucial for a number of emerging concepts towards a green energy economy transformation, which gained increased policy attention after the 2008–2009 global financial crisis [18] . The green economy paradigm exemplifies a strategy to enhance economic growth and job creation through the sustainable use of natural resources, energy efficiency, and valuation of ecosystem services [19] . It envisages a world in which industrial sectors minimize waste in every form, utilize renewable resources as input materials and fuel, and take every possible precaution to avoid harming workers, communities, the climate, or the environment. Moreover, structural change towards less carbon intensive sources, such as gas and renewables, implies a gain in employment [20] . Sustainable development is a multi-dimensional process that can be measured by a number of indicators representing its different dimensions. Because benchmarking country progress on various targets corresponding to different dimensions might be too difficult, an aggregated measure of a country’s relative position can be useful as a point of reference for policy formulation and advocacy. Policy analysts and policy makers therefore turn to composite indicators, which are better equipped to capture the multi-dimensional nature of sustainable industrial development. If composite indices are to measure progress, they need to incorporate a sufficient number of indicators so that multidimensionality is captured without compromising the interpretability of the index. Hence, the selection of underlying indicators is the result of a trade-off between possible redundancies caused by overlapping information and the risk of losing information. Composite indices, which facilitate assessments of country performance rather than identification of common trends across many separate indicators, may be helpful in setting policy priorities [21] . They can, however, also send misleading policy messages if they are poorly constructed or misinterpreted [22] . Since composite indices facilitate the interpretation of many separate indicators into one single measure, further analysis is necessary to identify the main drivers of the composite indicator results. Composite measures are thus better considered as invitations to closer investigation of the various components that underlie them [23] . As the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents an essential blueprint for development policies and to enable monitoring progress towards achieving SDGs, the global indicator framework for the Goals and targets was established by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs). This framework introduces a wide range of statistical and non-statistical indicators to track progress on the SDGs at the global level. It was agreed upon by the UN Statistical Commission in March 2017 and subsequently adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017 [24] . The proposed SDG-9 index introduced in this paper is exclusively constructed on the basis of those indicators to provide a new measure of ISID. Such a constructed composite index allows countries and policy makers measure the performance on achieving industry-related targets of SDG 9. The SDG-9 index also gives insights regarding which dimensions of sustainable industrial development countries lag behind or represent leaders. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Following the introduction, Section 2  provides an overview of existing indices that aim to capture progress on ISID. Section 3  presents the methodology and computation of the SDG-9 index. Section 4  describes the main findings by applying the index methodology together with a more detailed analysis of the respective dimensions. Section 5  compares the SDG-9 index 2016 with other indices that are based on a similar conceptual framework. The conclusions and ideas for future research are summarized in Section 6 .  2 Review of existing composite indices on inclusive and sustainable industrialization The adoption of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda has initiated a number of efforts to rank countries using composite indicators to capture their progress towards achieving all SDGs or their specific dimensions. The SDG index and Dashboards [25]  track countries’ progress towards achieving all SDGs. The final SDG index selects indicators from the global indicator framework. The assigned score shows a country’s position between the worst and the best result. The overall index indicates where a country stands on average compared to the best possible result across all 17 SDGs. The methodology sets an upper bound for each indicator to provide a comprehensive assessment of the distance to the targets based on the most recent data available. Capturing all 17 Goals is a tremendous feat given the large amount of missing data, particularly in the case of environmental indicators. Moreover, cross-country differences in the selection of indicators, data availability and methodologies make international comparisons difficult. The SDG index excludes indicators to which quantitative thresholds are not applicable to all countries, for instance, SDG-9 indicators that are relevant for manufacturing industries. Although manufacturing may be useful for developing long-term strategies for (re-) industrialization in individual countries, it is not possible to define a common global threshold for such strategies. Other composite indicators have been developed trying to capture countries’ economic development with a special focus on its impact on another given dimension such as inclusiveness, sustainability, structural change or the level of investments [26] . The Inclusive Development Index (IDI) published by the World Economic Forum (WEF) [27]  monitors countries’ progress towards overall economic development and does not only consider economic growth but its inclusiveness, intergenerational equity and sustainability as well. The WEF’s report demonstrates that the traditional measure of growth, i.e. gross domestic product (GDP), does not reflect the population’s well-being. In the past five years, nearly one third of the 103 economies included in the IDI saw a drop in their score, despite GDP per capita growth. Although the index provides a useful approach to benchmarking the inclusive economic development of countries, it does not investigate economic activities by sector (for instance, manufacturing). The Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE) has introduced the Green Economy Progress (GEP) Measurement Framework [28] , which is composed of a GEP Index and Dashboard of Sustainability indicators. The GEP index tracks countries’ progress in achieving the transition to an inclusive green economy at the national and global level. It captures characteristics of the green economy by including multidimensional indicators such as the link between health and the environment. Although the GEP index includes “economy” in its name, none of its indicators are economic or employment variables. Moll de Alba and Todorov [29]  developed the Green Industrial Performance (GIP) index to analyse the performance of countries in different dimensions of green manufacturing. They classify green manufacturing products and services based on a list derived from the U.S. Department of Commerce [30]  to benchmark countries’ performance in three dimensions: (i) the capacity to produce and export green manufactured goods, (ii) the role of green manufacturing, and (iii) social and environmental aspects of green manufacturing. Lin et al. [31]  introduced the Inclusive Sustainable Transformation (IST) index, which considers structural change to be the foundation of sustained and inclusive growth and the condition for achieving the SDGs. The IST index ranks countries based on the strength of their manufacturing sector and of their exports, their technological expertise, the equity and inclusiveness of their labour market and their environmental performance. The structural modernization index was developed by Lavopa and Szirmai [32]  to investigate the structural trajectories followed by different countries on their path towards achieving sustainable development. The trajectories of economic development are analysed in a single measure that is based on two dimensions, namely the process of structural modernization and the ability of countries to escape poverty and middle-income traps. UNIDO developed a CO2 -adjusted Competitive Industrial Performance (CIP) index in 2016, constructed on an experimental basis, to complement its CIP index edition [9] . The CIP index monitors three dimensions of countries’ industrial performance: (i) their capacity to produce and export manufactured goods, (ii) their level of technological deepening and upgrading, and (iii) the impact of the country’s economy on the world market. The CO2 -adjusted CIP index represents an additional instrument in cross-country comparisons of competitiveness by taking environmental externalities into account. The CIP index’s adjustment to include carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions from manufacturing rearranges the CIP ranking to the benefit of countries that effectively protect natural capital through measures of pollution abatement in manufacturing. This review reveals that no existing index takes account of the targets of the 2030 Agenda as a global blueprint for development policies and with a particular focus on the sustainability and inclusiveness of the manufacturing sector.  3 Design of the SDG-9 index: methodology and computation 3.1 Development of conceptual framework The SDGs have become the world’s shared action plan for achieving sustainable development; but countries need greater clarity on how to operationalize and track progress towards realizing all 17 Goals. Moreover, the achievement of the SDGs must also be supported by other stakeholders such as businesses, academia, and civil society. Six transformations to achieve the SDGs were introduced to help identify priority investments and regulatory challenges, calling for action all stakeholders to work together [13] . One of these transformations entails energy decarbonization and sustainable industry, with the aim of promoting changes in consumption and production patterns. This can contribute to a decoupling of human well-being from environmental degradation through circularity, which involves the reuse and recycling of materials, among other strategies [13] . Such a transformation is strongly associated with changes in the structure of the economy; the manufacturing industry plays a key role in this process [5] . Manufacturing is clearly a driver of economic growth as it creates jobs and generates income [33]  but it also poses challenges in terms of its effect on natural resource depletion and climate change [34] . From the perspective of technology and innovation, high-tech industries can be more environmentally sustainable because they pollute less than other industries [35] . The recycling industry, for example, is the best candidate for achieving sustained growth, as it generates employment and equity and is environmentally friendly [36] . Chakraborty and Mazzanti [37]  found that increasing research and development investment in green energy technologies is essential for reducing energy intensity. The objective of developing a new composite measure is to provide a tool for researchers and policy makers to evaluate countries’ performance based on how successful economies industrialize while preserving the environment and simultaneously promote inclusiveness. Since ISID is a multidimensional process that cannot be captured by a single indicator, constructing a composite indicator is the best solution for a benchmarking exercise that analyses the performance of countries along the various dimensions of ISID. Such a constructed index will also help countries track their progress in implementing the six transformations outlined by Sachs et al. [13] . An intuitive solution for constructing a composite measure to monitor the progress of countries towards achieving ISID is using indicators that are assigned to the industry-related targets under Goal 9 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The global indicator framework includes indicators covering all three dimensions and a new composite measure can thereby be introduced. The index is called the SDG-9 index and explores the level and growth patterns of manufacturing activities and their impact on production, employment as well as on the environment. Due to the small number of individual indicators, the index can be easily interpreted by any user and thus caters to the general public [22] .  3.2 Selection of indicators As mentioned above, the data is based on the global indicator framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The aim of constructing the SDG-9 index is to measure countries’ progress on ISID, thus the focus is on indicators assigned to the industry-related targets under Goal 9. The overview of SDG-9 targets and indicators is presented in Table 2 . Four targets building on seven indicators are directly linked to the process of industrialization. These indicators refer to all three dimensions of ISID - economic (9.2.1a, 9.2.1b, 9.3.1, 9.3.2, 9.b.1), social (9.2.2) and environmental (9.4.1). Although the target 9.5 calls for enhancing scientific research and upgrading industries’ technological capabilities, the indicators assigned to this target by the IAEG-SDGs refer to the economy as a whole. Moreover, data disaggregated by economic activity are not available to carry out a global comparison. As the SDG-9 index was designed to cover the industry-related targets, indicators 9.5.1 and 9.5.2 were not considered in the construction process. The IAEG-SDGs classifies indicators into Tier I, II and III depending on the availability of a precise statistical methodology and institutional capacity of countries to compile the required data.1  1 The Tier I indicator is conceptually clear, is based on an internationally established methodology, standards are available and data are regularly produced by at least 50 per cent of the countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant. The Tier II indicator is conceptually clear, is based on an internationally established methodology, standards are available but data are not regularly produced by countries. Tier III refers to indicators for which no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available but the methodology/standards for the indicator are being (or will be) developed or tested.   All industry-related indicators are classified as Tier I or Tier II. The indicators assigned to the target 9.3 reflecting the role of small-scale industrial and other enterprises were reclassified from Tier III at the sixth IAEG-SDGs meeting in November 2017. The reporting mechanism is currently being established starting with an initial data collection based on the approved methodological concept. Due to the limited number of countries reporting on the target 9.3, these indicators were excluded from the construction of the SDG-9 index. The indicators selected for the compilation of the SDG-9 index are manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of GDP (MVAsh ) and per capita (MVApc ), manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment (EMP ), CO2  emissions from manufacturing industries per unit of MVA (CO2 ) and the share of medium–high and high-tech manufacturing value added in total value added (MHT ). The data used to construct the composite indicator are sourced from the SDG Global Database, which offers internationally comparable data series [38] . The final dataset are unbalanced panel data. The coverage of indicators and their sources are shown in Table 1  . The number of countries corresponds to the total number of countries with data entries across all years from 2000 to 2018. The 2030 Agenda aims to provide global monitoring over the next 15 years starting from 2015. The complete dataset from 2000 to 2016 is used for our preliminary analysis followed by the construction of the SDG-9 index.  The performance of countries is also analysed using the UNIDO country groupings [39] , i.e. industrialized economies, emerging industrial economies, other developing economies and least developed countries (LDCs). The SDG-9 index analysis is presented in the next chapter and it focuses on performance by dimension and by development group in the year 2016. First, all indicators are normalized according to the min–max method within the range [ 0 , 1 ]    to standardize the variables for further data aggregation as they have different measurement units. The indicators MVAsh , MVApc , EMP  and MHT  are considered to be “positive”, i.e. the country with the best performance is assigned the highest score, a value of 1, and the country with the worst performance is assigned by the lowest score, a value of 0. Because reductions in CO2  are desirable, we reverse the meaning of the indicator and use an inverse normalization. The country with the highest level of manufacturing CO2  intensity is assigned a value of 0 and the country with the lowest CO2  intensity a value of 1. The min–max method is a useful approach to normalize indicators with a small range of values; on the other hand, it can distort indicators including extreme values or outliers. Fig. 1   presents the normalized indicators in 2016 and their distribution together with their correlation measures and the distribution of the pairs of indicators with 0.975 tolerance ellipses. The distribution of the indicators MVApc  and CO2  is highly skewed, which is preserved after normalization. This feature reflects the unequal distribution of manufacturing production in the world since production capacity is concentrated in a few countries including China, USA, Japan and Germany. All normalized indicators reveal positive cross-correlation patterns resulting in a more robust composite measure and rather low sensitivity when changing weights [40] . The correlation structure of the underlying indicators can be further investigated through multivariate statistical methods such as a principal component analysis (PCA) [22] . PCA is a widely used method aiming to reduce the dimensionality of complex datasets by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that preserves most of the original information. The reduced data set is easier to visualize and explore [41] . Fig. 2   illustrates a biplot using the results from the PCA. A biplot is a widely used statistical tool to visualize the resulting loadings and scores of a dimension reduction technique applied to multivariate data. A resulting biplot represents a simple two-variate scatterplot displaying both observations and variables in one graph. The observations (countries) are represented as data points while the variables (normalized indicators) are displayed as arrows. The biplot for the data set from 2016 (Fig. 2 ) is based on the first two principal components explaining 82.7% of the total variance. The biplot reveals already mentioned correlation patterns, as all variables are positively correlated considering that they all point in the same direction. Arrows close to each other, for instance the normalized MVApc  and the normalized MHT  or the normalized EMP  and the normalized MVAsh  respectively, show high positive correlations. This variable is particularly dominant in countries located close to the arrows, for instance China has the second highest share of MVA in GDP after Ireland and Singapore has the highest share of medium–high and high-tech MVA. The resulting groups of countries with respect to single variables (indicators) as depicted in the biplot are observed in the final ranking of the SDG-9 index.  3.3 Methodology Constructing the final SDG-9 composite indicator requires a normalization of indicators to make them comparable. The OECD Handbook on Composite Indicators [22]  provides a step-by-step approach for the construction and use of such composite measures in practice. Each of the five indicators considered for the SDG-9 index compilation are normalized into the range of [ 0 , 1 ]    using the min–max method, where the minimum and maximum values are taken from each indicator sample,(1) I ic t  = x ic t  - min   c   x i t   max   c   x i t  - min   c   x i t    ,    (2) I ic t  = max   c   x i t  - x ic t   max   c   x i t  - min   c   x i t    ,    where x  ic  t      signifies the value of the i -th indicator for the c -th country at time t . Eq. (1)  is valid for indicators with higher values representing better performance (MVAsh , MVApc , EMP  and MHT ); Eq. (2)  is valid for indicators with lower values representing better performance (CO2 ). After all five indicators are normalized, the SDG-9 index is constructed as a geometric mean using equal weights for each of the k  indicators and each country c  as(3) ( SDG - 9 )  c t  = ∏ i = 1  k  I ic t    1 k   ,    with values varying within the range [ 0 , 1 ]   . The selection of equal weighting makes the index highly transparent, a key feature of well-designed indices [22] . The logic behind choosing equal weights was also supported by the positive correlation patterns between normalized indicators that should have a smaller impact on the selection of weights [40] . The robustness of the SDG-9 index can be tested by taking uncertainty factors into consideration and conducting a sensitivity analysis. Different scenarios were tested to identify the composite index’s level of sensitivity to the change in parameters – different weighting schemes, aggregation methods and a successive exclusion of indicators. The resulting variation of countries’scores and rankings are depicted in Figs. 3 and 4   . The countries are ordered according to their median and the original value of the SDG-9 index is marked in red. The ranking of countries is very robust for economies in the top and bottom quintiles of the scale. Although the countries that are listed between those tails reveal a wider interquartile range, the original SDG-9 index ranking remains very close to the median. More than half of the economies only shifted by maximum one position from the median rank. The scores are positively skewed, which is caused by changes in the weighting system. If equal weights are abandoned, greater importance is given to the environmental dimension represented by CO2  emissions intensity. The distribution of normalized CO2  is heavily skewed and dominated by high values close to 1. Major differences in scores and ranks are usually witnessed when an indicator that represents country’s comparative advantage is excluded. In other words, if the country performs very well in one dimension only or in one indicator only, it is more sensitive to any change in the index’s weighting setting or the exclusion of the particular indicator. Testing alternative scenarios by excluding indicators showed that the least influential indicator is CO2  emission intensity and the MVA per capita carries the most weight.   4 The SDG-9 index 4.1 Global analysis of sustainable and inclusive industrial development based on the SDG-9 index The SDG-9 index is calculated for 128 economies for which data are available for all indicators to improve the comparability of the performance over the years 2000–2016. This chapter focuses on the ranking and scores of the SDG-9 index, particularly on the year 2016. The final ranking and its components are available in Table 3  . The global distribution of SDG-9 scores in 2016 is depicted in Fig. 5  . The SDG-9 score varies from 0 to 0.73, however values are skewed towards lower scores with a median value of 0.26. In 2016, the top 10 ranked economies were Ireland, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Japan, Czechia, Taiwan Province of China, Slovakia, Singapore and Austria. All of them belong to the group of industrialized economies according to the UNIDO country grouping system [39] . Fig. 5  reveals some regional patterns towards achieving SDG industry-related targets. The highest scores are for the most part reached by economies situated in Central Europe and Eastern Asia. In contrast, the poorest SDG-9 index performance is observed in LDCs, especially those located in sub-Saharan Africa. The comparison of the 2016 SDG-9 index with the ranking and scores of the year 2010 shows how countries improved their performance over time. In terms of scores, the biggest jump upwards was achieved by Ireland, increasing its overall score by 0.165 and thereby climbing from the 7th to 1st in the rankings. This is mainly related to the fact that a number of large manufacturing corporations have relocated their activities to Ireland in recent years. Due to low corporation tax rates, sales (production) generated from the use of intellectual property boosted Irish GDP and MVA [39] . Looking at the rankings, Viet Nam experienced the biggest increase, jumping 17 positions from the 85th to the 68th rank. Although Lebanon and Israel dropped significantly, by 16 and 13 places respectively, their scores changed only slightly.  4.2 Investigation of dimensions and country groupings The final SGD-9 index is constructed from five indicators covering different dimensions of ISID. Another step to investigate performance of countries leads to a further analysis of single components. Fig. 6   shows how the scores are distributed by country groups taking into account not only the final composite measure (SDG-9 ), but also separate scores for included indicators (MVAsh , MVApc , EMP , CO2  and MHT ). Industrialized economies performed best in all dimensions of the SDG-9 index, including almost all countries achieving the top normalized scores equal to 1. The leading countries in respective dimensions are Ireland (MVAsh  with 31.6%, MVApc  with $22,217), Czechia (EMP  with 27.8%), Namibia (CO2  with 0.02 kg/USD) and Singapore (MHT  with 78.1%). The normalized MVApc  by country groups indicates the same pattern as already recognized by the correlation analysis. The distribution is heavily positively skewed, suggesting unequal allocation of manufacturing production capacities globally. The median scores are successively decreasing with the level of industrial development as classified by UNIDO groupings - from industrialized economies to LDCs. The distribution of the normalized CO2  emissions intensity is also very skewed with high values concentrated in the group of industrialized economies and countries specialized in low-technology manufacturing activities. Fig. 7   presents the performance of selected countries by individual indicators according to the results of the SDG-9 scores and rankings in 2016. The radar chart is a useful visualization tool to help countries to develop and improve their national development strategies. The graph can reveal dimensions that should be addressed for a countries’ further development. Moreover, it can help identify economies with a higher level of development to serve as role models. The left side of Fig. 7  depicts the top five industrialized economies (Ireland, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Japan) showing their scores in various dimensions. All countries perform very well in all dimensions, their scores varying between 0.5 and 1, and therefore they represent also the top five countries of the overall SDG-9 ranking. The right part of the graph shows the top five emerging industrial economies – China (13th rank), Romania (20th), Poland (22nd), Thailand (23rd) and Turkey (30th). This reveals significantly lower scores for MVA per capita, close to zero. The untapped potential in emerging industrial economies is visible with regards to the MHT  indicator. Promoting medium–high and high-tech manufacturing activities might help these countries to increase their competitive advantage and thus raise MVA per capita.   5 Comparison of the SDG-9 index to other indices For further analysis, the SDG-9 index is compared to other performance indicators on ISID mentioned in Section 2 . A focus of this comparative study is given to the top performing economies from each country group – five industrialized countries (Ireland, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Japan), five emerging industrial economies (China, Romania, Poland, Thailand and Turkey), three other developing economies (Philippines, El Salvador and Guatemala) and three LDCs (Bangladesh, Myanmar and Senegal). The local regression method is applied to explore the relation between indices since the structure seems to be highly complex and non-linear in the selected cases. All figures show apparent clusters for country groupings and relation between corresponding composite measures. Fig. 8   illustrates a relation of the SDG-9 index to other indices developed by UNIDO, i.e. the CO2 -adjusted CIP index and the GIP index. The CO2 -adjusted CIP index was chosen rather than the widely-used CIP index due to its extension for the environmental effects of manufacturing production. That makes its relationship to the SDG-9 index stronger than to the CIP index, which is solely established on economic indicators. Industrialized economies dominate the top positions of both the SDG-9 and CO2 -adjusted CIP rankings. Other countries are gathered around the regression line that indicates a proportional behavior between both indicators: an increase in the SDG-9 scores accompanies a raise in the scores of the CO2 -adjusted CIP index. In both rankings, the top five ranked countries are almost the same – with the exception of the Republic of Korea, which is replaced by Italy in the case of the CO2 -adjusted CIP index. The comparison with the GIP index shows more scattered results. However, the relation between both indices reveals a similar pattern as for the CO2 -adjusted CIP index. It is evident that the group of emerging industrial economies overlaps with lower ranked industrialized countries. Fig. 9   compares the SDG-9 index to indices with a similar conceptual framework to capture inclusive and sustainable (industrial) development, i.e. the IDI and the IST index. A clear pattern of a positive correlation is observed between the SDG-9 index and both indices. In general, the higher the IDI or IST score, the higher the score of the SDG-9 index. These two indices are of special interest with respect to the SDG-9 index since they incorporate similar indicators. The IDI index contains indicators such as GDP per capita, employment and carbon intensity of GDP. However its focus is on the impact of the whole economy. It should be noted that data for the IDI are not available for many LDCs, which do therefore not appear in the comparison. Fig. 9  reveals the inverse U-shaped relation between the IDI and the SDG-9 index with visible clusters of countries according to their stage of industrial development. The curve suggests that there are significant differences within the group of industrialized economies. Although they perform very well in terms of economic growth and environmental performance, they face a critical challenge represented by increasing economic and social inequalities. The closest relationship to the SDG-9 index can be observed with the IST index. The IST index is constructed using 23 indicators along 8 dimensions including manufacturing. Indicators selected for the SDG-9 index are all included in the framework for the IST index. The only distinction comes with carbon dioxide intensity, which is calculated for manufacturing industries only in the case of the SDG-9 index. Although the data points are widely scattered, they follow the regression line as countries industrialize.  6 Concluding remarks The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes the importance of encompassing all dimensions of sustainable development to ensure sustainable social and economic progress worldwide. The universal adoption of the 2030 Agenda makes it the key guidelines for achieving sustainable future for all. Through the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals, governments should implement the Goals and targets into their national development strategies and create a plan of action. The paper introduces a new index to measure the progress of countries towards meeting the industry-related targets of Sustainable Development Goal 9 and thus achieving inclusive and sustainable industrial development. The SDG-9 index builds on a series of contributions on other composite indicators tracking paths of countries on their way to sustainable development. Adding to this literature, the SDG-9 index is directly linked to global goals of the 2030 Agenda and thus the final results can help countries assess their own positioning towards inclusive and sustainable industrial development with respect to their national development plans. Furthermore, policy makers are equipped with a tool examining countries’ performance relative to other globally. The paper proposes a straightforward tool to help countries track performance in different dimensions of sustainable development and to enable policy makers and researchers to develop strategies towards achieving inclusive and sustainable industrial development. For this reason, the indicators for the construction of the SDG-9 index are selected based on the global indicator framework for monitoring Sustainable Development Goals. Mainstreaming inclusive and sustainable industrial development in national policies expects governments to gain a solid understanding of the relationships, synergies and trade-offs of industry-specific strategies and policy instruments leading to economic growth, social inclusiveness and environmental sustainability. One important contribution of the paper is the verification of the existence of different stages of industrial development. The SDG-9 index shows that industrialized economies dominate the overall ranking as they perform best in all dimensions captured in the composite measure. Evidence indicates that developing countries at an early stage of industrialization have more opportunities to achieve inclusive industrial development experiencing fast economic growth with limited environmental damage. Labour-intensive industries, such as food and beverages, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, textiles and wearing apparel, are most likely to generate the most significant employment opportunities because low wages can provide developing countries with a comparative advantage in these industries. As countries further develop the skills of their workforce and expand their infrastructure, opportunities for growth and employment generation arise in other industries, but usually draw on increasing amounts of production factors, such as natural resources and energy. Most emerging industrial economies reveal a large share of manufacturing in total economic activity, yet lag behind in the ranking due to the high carbon dioxide emission intensity. Reducing green house gas emissions can be achieved through the use of more efficient technologies, exploitation of alternative energy sources or the change of specialization towards the production of more environmentally-friendly goods. As least developed countries appear mostly at the bottom of the SDG-9 ranking, true political commitment and better institutional capacity is needed to include inclusive and sustainable industrial development policies in the countries’ long-term strategies. Least developed countries are dominated by the agricultural sector and the existing manufacturing industry is based on low technology products with very low levels of pollution; however, these countries often face the worst impact of climate change. Achieving inclusive and sustainable industrial development in least developed countries implies introducing policies which are not exclusively focused on economic growth but more on structural transformation that will help to generate jobs while limiting damage to the environment. The final ranking confirms that economic growth should be accompanied by technological change and efficient use of natural resources and energy to mitigate the impact of expanding production on the environment. The foremost challenge for low-income countries is sustaining the process of industrialization; for middle-income countries, it is environmental sustainability, and for deindustrializing high-income countries, it is continued employment generation and inclusive industrial development. Several potential improvements could be considered for future research activities on the SDG-9 index. To ensure that no one is left behind, the index can be extended for gender disaggregated indicators to support gender inclusiveness. Finally, as data on indicators for small-scale industrial enterprises will be regularly collected, the indicators 9.3.1 and 9.3.2 can be included into the final SDG-9 index construction in future editions.
