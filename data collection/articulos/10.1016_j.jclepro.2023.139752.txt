                  Currently, insufficient attention has been given to reducing tourism's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (TCEs). Therefore, here, taking China as a case, we analyzed tourism's carbon reduction and sustainability by developing an innovative framework that incorporates social network analysis and the logarithmic mean Divisia index under the guidance of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The results showed that the TCEs exhibited an overall growth trend. East China had the highest share. West China exceeded central China after 2014. Structurally, tourism transportation was the largest emitter (more than 80%). The TCEs' spatial network was increasingly stable. Especially, the developed regions such as Jiangsu, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhejiang were the centers of the network. So, these should be the key areas for CO2 reduction. Tourist scale was the main driver with a contribution of 165%. Tourism consumption (35%) and sectoral structure (3%) followed it. Inversely, energy intensity was the most important inhibiting factor (−85%), and spatial distribution structure (−18%) followed it. Therefore, it can be concluded that the new analytical framework can be effectively and successfully applied in China. And, some reasonable, low-carbon, or sustainable development countermeasures can be proposed for China's tourism.

Therefore, here, taking China as a case, we analyzed tourism's carbon reduction and sustainability by developing an innovative framework that incorporates social network analysis and the logarithmic mean Divisia index under the guidance of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The results showed that the TCEs exhibited an overall growth trend. East China had the highest share. West China exceeded central China after 2014. Structurally, tourism transportation was the largest emitter (more than 80%). The TCEs' spatial network was increasingly stable. Especially, the developed regions such as Jiangsu, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhejiang were the centers of the network. So, these should be the key areas for CO2  reduction. Tourist scale was the main driver with a contribution of 165%. Tourism consumption (35%) and sectoral structure (3%) followed it. Inversely, energy intensity was the most important inhibiting factor (−85%), and spatial distribution structure (−18%) followed it. Therefore, it can be concluded that the new analytical framework can be effectively and successfully applied in China. And, some reasonable, low-carbon, or sustainable development countermeasures can be proposed for China's tourism.

For example, it is reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that humanity should limit the global temperature rise to 1.5° above pre-industrial levels (IPCC, 2022 ). Therefore, taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts has also become one of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Gyimah et al., 2023 ). Tourism, accounting for 10.3% of all jobs and 10.4% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2019 ), has been the focus in the 21st century (Tao and Huang, 2014 ). It is reported that tourism's carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions (TCEs), accounted for 8% of total global CO2  emissions (Lenzen et al., 2018 ), and were expected to increase by 25% from 2016 levels by 2030 (World Tourism Organization & International Transport Forum, 2019 ). So, an important question arises. How can we take action to combat climate change and promote sustainability in the tourism industry? In the United Nations SDG8.9, sustainable tourism is considered one that can create jobs and promote local culture and products (Musavengane, 2019 ). But this definition overemphasizes the sociality of sustainable tourism while ignoring its natural attributes (i.e., CO2  emissions), humanistic, and economic attributes (Chen et al., 2018 ). Therefore, using China as a case, we aim to assess sustainable tourism from multiple perspectives, including social, economic, natural, and humanistic attributes, and to construct an overall and innovative analytical framework, which can break down the main question into three smaller questions (Fig. 1  ). 1. How to compute the TCEs and what are the TCEs' spatiotemporal characteristics? 2. What are the TCEs' clustering, social network structure, and inequality (differences)? 3. What are the TCEs' driving factors from tourism economics and humanistic, etc., perspectives? So, to answer these questions, first, sufficient attention should be given to the accounting of the total TCEs, which contain the tourism carbon emissions from transportation (TTP), accommodation (TAM), and activities (TAV). Thus, the natural spatiotemporal characteristics of the TCEs can be analyzed. Second, an improved gravitational model was utilized to shape the network structure of the TCEs. Hence, the social characteristics and inequality of the TCEs could be analyzed from three perspectives including overall network, centrality, and spatial clustering, using social network analysis (SNA). Third, a logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) was incorporated in searching for the economic or humanistic driving factors (attributes) of the TCEs. Finally, according to the unsustainable factors identified during the research process, some targeted improvement measures or sustainability suggestions could be proposed to conform to the guidance of the United Nations’ SDGs (Fig. 1 ).  2 Literature review For the accounting approach of TCEs, Gössling (2000)  first proposed a method to calculate CO2  emissions from air travel in developed countries. After that, the related studies of TCEs became more and more systematic (Table 1  ). However, a standard method was missing because of the gap in special data and the complexity of tourism (Kuo and Chen, 2009 ). The mainstream methods were the “top-down” method and the “bottom-up” method. While considering tourism as a part of the national economic system, the “top-down” method combines the tourism satellite account (TSA) with the national accounting matrix including environmental accounts (NAMEA) or the national accounting system. This method was more commonly used in countries with well-established TSA (Perch-Nielsen et al., 2010 ; Dwyer et al., 2010 ; Minx et al., 2009 ). However, only a few scholars in China used the “top-down” method because of the limitations in theory and data, as well as the infant TSA development (Meng et al., 2017 ). Thus, despite its accessibility to data collection, the “top-down” method needs to be supported by mature TSA or other statistical systems for tourism. The “bottom-up” method was, therefore, more applicable to be used in China. It collected data from the entire industry or tourists, or both (Luo et al., 2018 ). These data could break down energy use, fuel sources, and emissions into detailed micro-level information on various transport modes, accommodation categories, and tourist attractions. Gössling (2002)  used the “bottom-up” method to quantify the energy consumption of global tourism. Shi and Wu (2011)  first adopted this method to estimate the energy consumption and CO2  emissions across all sectors of China's tourism. Since then, the “bottom-up” has also been used in the field of TCEs' measurement in China by other scholars (Lin, 2010 ; Tang et al., 2014 ). However, an updated study of the relevant data is still lacking (Table 1 ). Therefore, using this bottom-up accounting method of accounting for the TCEs (Fig. 1 ), this paper completes the research on updating this data. This is one of the innovations of this paper. For the spatial structure analysis of TCEs, most studies only used the geographic information system (GIS) to demonstrate the spatial variations of the TCEs and have few results focusing on their spatial correlation network (Zhang and Liu, 2016 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Dong et al., 2023 ). Traditionally, spatial association networks can be built through the gravitational models (Li et al., 2021 ) and the vector auto-regression (VAR) model (Zhi et al., 2022 ). Considering the simplicity and practicability of the method, the gravity model is adopted. However, the classical traditional gravity model is used under ideal conditions, while the conditions of the relationship between different provinces and regions at the national scale in this paper have certain particularities. Therefore, an improved gravitational model is introduced to shape the network of the TCEs in China. The improved model is better suited to the measurement of interregional gravity (Wang et al., 2018 ). However, it cannot describe other social-economic relationships, especially between two non-adjacent regions. Fortunately, the SNA can make up for this shortcoming, although it has been still few used in this TCEs field. As one widely recognized and promoted method, the SNA can enable researchers to quantify network participants and their connections with “relational data” (He et al., 2020 ). So, the SNA was also introduced in this study, which is another innovation of this paper (Fig. 1 ). However, only a limited number of results can be found in the SNA. For example, based on the SNA, Wang et al. (2019)  studied the spatial correlation of TCEs in China from 2000 to 2015, and Deng et al. (2022)  analyzed the spatial correlation between tourism economic growth and TCEs in China (Table 1 ). Other scholars have also used SNA in the study of TCEs' efficiency (Wang et al., 2022 ) and CO2  neutrality in tourism (Zhu and Wang, 2023 ). But the drivers of each province in China, represented by the nodes in the network, still need further analysis, particularly in terms of economic or humanistic macro-drivers. Therefore, researchers have adopted various methods to analyze them, including the tourism life-cycle theory (Tang et al., 2017 ), the Thiel index (Huang et al., 2019 ), index decomposition analysis (IDA), and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) (Luo et al., 2020 ), and the LMDI (Zha et al., 2021 ). Among these methods, LMDI has highly adaptable features and does not produce residual terms, and allows for the presence of zero values in data processing (Chen et al., 2022 ). Therefore, it is widely used in studying energy drivers (Fatima et al., 2019 ; Chen et al., 2018 ) and was first used in the driver's decomposition of the TCEs, which is also the innovation of this paper. In summary, a “bottom-up” accounting method for calculating the TCEs of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2019 was first used. Then, an improved gravitational model was used to construct the spatial network of TCEs. After that, the SNA and the LMDI were used to observe the TCEs, respectively, from the perspectives of complex social networks and macroeconomic or humanistic drivers. Research methods and related data sources are in section 3 . Results and discussion are in section 4 . The conclusion and policy implications are in section 5 .  3 Methodology and data 3.1 Bottom-up accounting method of the TCEs As shown in Fig. 1 , a “bottom-up” accounting method for the TCEs is first used (Shi and Wu, 2011 ; Luo et al., 2018 ) because it allows us to objectively observe the time change trend and spatial distribution dynamics of the TCEs (Chen et al., 2022 ). Namely, the TCEs’ natural attributes can be clearly identified by this method. The calculation formulas are equations (1)–(6) .(1) C = C T T P   + C T A M   + C T A V       where C    denotes the total TCEs. C T T P     , C T A M     , and C T A V      represent the CO2  emissions of TTP, TAM and TAV, respectively.(2) C T T P   = ∑ a = 1  30  ∑ f = 1  4  Q a f   × L f  × ∝ f         (3) Q a f   = R a f   × F a f       where C T T P      denotes the CO2  emissions of TTP. Q a f      is the passenger turnover for transport mode f    of province a   . L f     denotes the CO2  emission coefficient of the transport mode f   . ∝ f     is the proportion of the transport mode f    to passenger traffic. R a f      is the passenger traffic volume for transport mode f    of province a   , and F a f      denotes the average transportation distance for transport mode f    of province a   .(4) C T A M   = ∑ a = 1  30  M a  × R a  × β × d       (5) β = w × φ     where C T A M      denotes the CO2  emissions of TAM. M a     is the number of beds in hotels of province a   . R a     indicates the annual occupancy rate of province a   . β    is the CO2  emission per bed per night. d    is the number of days in a year. w    is the energy consumption per bed per night of the star-rated hotel, and φ    is the conversion coefficient between energy consumption and CO2  emissions per bed per night of the hotel.(6) C T A V   = ∑ a = 1  30  ∑ h = 1  5  S a h    × U h        where C T A V      denotes the CO2  emissions of TAV. S a h      is the number of tourists participating in activity type h    of province a   , and U h     is the CO2  emission coefficient of activity type h   . The parameters of equations (2)–(6)  can be seen in the Table A1 .  3.2 Improved gravity model Considering that the actual distance between two points on the Earth is a spherical distance (Wang et al., 2018 ), a systematical modification of the traditional gravity model is adopted in this paper (Li et al., 2021 ), which can be seen in Fig. 1  and listed as follows.(7) T a b   = y a b   × ( p a  C a  G a   3  × p b  C b  G b   3   )  [ ∅ a b   l a  ‐ l b    ]  2       (8) y a b   = C a  C a  + C b        where T a b      denotes the TCEs' association relationship between provinces a    and b   . p a     and p b     are the year-end population of provinces a    and b   . G a     and G b     are the total tourism revenue of provinces a    and b   . C a     and C b     are the TCEs in provinces a    and b   . ∅ a b      is the spherical distance between the capitals of provinces a    and b   , and l a   ‐ l b     is per-capita GDP disparity between provinces a    and b   . y a b     , the gravitational coefficient, is the proportion of TCEs of the province a    to the total TCEs of provinces a    and b   . Equation (7)  establishes the inter-provincial gravitational matrix. Averages of each row are calculated and compared with individual entries. Entries exceeding the average get a value of 1, indicating incidence relation, or 0 otherwise, signifying no relation. Hence the binary matrix of TCEs in each province can be created.  3.3 Social network analysis Social network analysis can help us identify important entities from the perspective of social-spatial distribution, including countries, regions, and other social elements (Liu et al., 2023 ; Borgatti et al., 2009 ). Therefore, in this paper, it is used to identify key tourism carbon emission zones (Fig. 1 ). It is mainly achieved by comparing three types of indicators: overall network characteristics (density, efficiency, and hierarchy), centrality (degree, closeness, and betweenness), and spatial clustering (Wasserman and Faust, 1994 ).(1) Overall network characteristics    Network density, ranging from 0 to 1, denotes the closeness of TCEs between nodes. A value near 1 denotes a denser network, indicating stronger node connections. The calculation formula is:(9) D = I N ( N ‐ 1   )        where D    is the network density. I    denotes the number of actual network relationships. N    is the number of nodes in the overall network. Network efficiency represents the connection efficiency among nodes in the TCEs' network. Lower efficiency means more redundant lines, superimposed spillover effects, and tighter spatial TCEs’ connections. The calculation formula is:(10) E = 1  ‐  μ max ( μ )        where E    is network efficiency. μ    is the number of extra lines in the network, and max (μ   ) is the maximum number of potentially redundant lines in the overall network. Network hierarchy reflects each node's position within the overall network. A higher value means more peripheral nodes. The calculation formula is:(11) H = 1  ‐  W max ( W )        where H    is the network hierarchy. W    is the logarithm of the symmetric reachable node in the network and max (W   ) is the logarithm of the maximum reachable node in the overall network.(2) Centrality    Centrality indicates a node's position and role within the network structure. Node central to the TCEs' correlation network exhibits high independence, implying significant control and dominance over peripheral nodes. In general, indicators such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality are used to analyze the centrality characteristics. Degree centrality is the number of nodes directly related to the studied node, which represents the node's central position and influence. A higher degree of centrality suggests that the studied node is closer to the center and is directly connected to more nodes. The calculation formula is:(12) F N  = n ( N ‐  1   )       where F N    is the degree centrality. n    is the number of nodes directly associated with the studied node. N    is the number of nodes in the overall network. Closeness centrality is calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the shortest paths between a node and all other nodes. Thus, the more central a node, the closer it is to all other nodes. This reflects the degree to which a node is not controlled by others. The calculation formula is:(13) B N  i  ‐ 1   = ∑ j = 1   n  d i j        where B N  i  ‐ 1      is the closeness centrality. d i j      is the shortcut distance between nodes i    and j   , that is, the number of lines contained in the shortcut. n  is the same as it in formula (12) . Betweenness centrality reflects the degree of control one node exerts over relations among other nodes. In the correlation network, the betweenness centrality of a node is directly proportional to its ability to manage resources and information. The calculation formula is:(14) C N  j  = 2 ∑ j n  ∑ k n  B j k   ( i )      n 2   ‐ 3 n + 2    j ≠ k ≠ i , a n d   j < k     (15) B j k   ( i )  = g j k   ( i )   g j k        where C N  j     is the betweenness centrality, and B j k   ( i )     is the ability of the third node i    to affect the association between nodes j    and k   , that is, the probability that node i    is on a shortcut between nodes j    and k   . The number of shortcuts between nodes j    and k    is expressed by g j k     , and the number of shortcuts that exist between nodes j    and k    through nodes i    is expressed by g j k   ( i )    . n  is the same as it in formula (12) .(3) Spatial clustering    Spatial clustering is completed by the block model, which was first proposed by White et al. (1976) . It enables the direct analysis of each block's status and role in the network, reflecting its clustering characteristics. There are four modules in the block model (Burt, 1976 ): bidirectional spillover, net spillover, broker, and net beneficiary. Members of bidirectional spillover block both send relationships to and receive relationships from other blocks, with more relationships from members within the block. Members of the net spillover block have much greater relationships with other blocks than they receive from other blocks and fewer relationships within the block. The broker block serves as a “bridge” in the overall network. It is loosely connected internally, but both send and receive relationships. Members of the net beneficiary block receive more relationships from other blocks than they send. Wasserman and Faust (1994)  outlined indicators to examine internal relationships, as shown in Table 2  . Assuming that the entire network includes g    nodes, where a block includes g k     nodes, then g k  × ( g − 1   )     depicts the maximum possible relationships for all member of the block in the network. g k  × ( g k  − 1   )     represents the max possible relationships within the block. Thus, under ideal conditions, the optimal internal relationship ratio for the block is: [ g k  × ( g k  ‐ 1   )   ]  [ g k  × ( g ‐ 1   )   ]   = ( g k  ‐ 1   )  ( g ‐ 1   )     .  3.4 LMDI method Kaya (1989)  introduced the Kaya identity to examine the relationship between CO2  emissions resulting from human social activities and various economic, policy, and demographic factors. Ang (1994) , Ang and Choi (1997) , Ang et al. (1998) , Ang and Liu (2001) , and Ang and Liu (2007)  proposed the LMDI decomposition due to its universality, based on the extended Kaya identity (Fatima et al., 2019 ). So, in this paper, the factors affecting China's TCEs can be seen in Fig. 1  and are similarly extended as follows:(16) C = ∑ a = 1   30  ∑ x = 1   3  C x a   F x a    × F x a   F a   × F a  Y a   × Y a  Y  × Y P  × P       where C    denotes the total TCEs. C x a      is the TCEs of sector x    in province a   . F x a      is the energy consumption of sector x    in province a   . F a     is the energy consumption of province a   . Y a     is the tourism revenue of province a   . Y  is the total tourism revenue, and P  is the total number of tourists. Let:(17) V = C x a   F x a    , S E  = F x a   F a   , E I  = F a  Y a   , S T  = Y a  Y  , C E  = Y P  , P = P     where V   , S E   , E I   , S T   , C E    and P    represent the TCEs' coefficient (V) factor, sectoral structure (SE) factor, energy intensity (EI) factor, spatial structure (ST) factor, tourism consumption level (CE) factor and tourist scale (P) factor, respectively. C 0     denotes the TCEs of the base year during the calculation period, and C t     represents the TCEs of the t  year. So, the additive LMDI model is used to decompose the changes of the TCEs into:(18) Δ C  = C t   ‐  C 0  = Δ C V  + Δ C S E   + Δ C E I   + Δ C S T   + Δ C C E   + Δ C P      where Δ C V    , Δ C S E     , Δ C E I     , Δ C S T     , Δ C C E      and Δ C P     represent the TCEs' coefficient effect, sectoral structure effect, energy intensity effect, spatial structure effect, tourism consumption level effect and tourist scale effect. The contribution of each factor is expressed as follows:(19) Δ C V  = ∑ a = 1   30  ∑ x = 1   3  ( C  x t  ‐ C x 0   )  ( ln  C x t  ‐ ln  C x 0   )   ( ln V t  V 0    )        (20) Δ C S E   = ∑ a = 1   30  ∑ x = 1   3  ( C  x t  ‐ C x 0   )  ( ln  C x t  ‐ ln  C x 0   )   ( ln S E  t  S E  0    )        (21) Δ C E I   = ∑ a = 1   30  ∑ x = 1   3  ( C  x t  ‐ C x 0   )  ( ln  C x t  ‐ ln  C x 0   )   ( ln E I  t  E I  0    )        (22) Δ C S T   = ∑ a = 1   30  ∑ x = 1   3  ( C  x t  ‐ C x 0   )  ( ln  C x t  ‐ ln  C x 0   )   ( ln S T  t  S T  0    )        (23) Δ C C E   = ∑ a = 1   30  ∑ x = 1   3  ( C  x t  ‐ C x 0   )  ( ln  C x t  ‐ ln  C x 0   )   ( ln C E  t  C E  0    )        (24) Δ C P  = ∑ a = 1   30  ∑ x = 1   3  ( C  x t  ‐ C x 0   )  ( ln  C x t  ‐ ln  C x 0   )   ( ln P t  P 0    )         Notably, the CO2  coefficient typically remains constant in practical applications (Chen et al., 2022 ). Therefore, the Δ C V     always equals 0 and it is not considered in the paper.  3.5 Data explanation Data from only China's 30 provinces or autonomous regions are selected because the data for Tibet is missing, and those on Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are inconsistent in statistical caliber. The number of beds and hotel room occupancy rates can be calculated by the tourism accommodation (https://www.zgtjnj.org/naviBooklist-N2005110410-1.html ). The data on transportation type classification and passenger turnover can be extracted from the 2001–2020 China Transportation Yearbook (http://www.zgjtnjs.com/ ), China Statistical Yearbook (http://www.stats.gov.cn/sj/ndsj/ ), and each province's National Economic and Social Development Statistical Bulletin (i.e., http://tjj.beijing.gov.cn/ ). Data on tourism activity classification and numbers of domestic and inbound tourists can be extracted from the 2001–2018 China Tourism Statistical Yearbook, the 2019–2020 China Cultural Relics and Tourism Statistical Yearbook, and each province's 2000–2020 Provincial and Municipal Statistical Yearbook (https://www.zgtjnj.org/naviBooklist-N2005110410-1.html  and http://tjj.beijing.gov.cn/ etc.). Economic and population data can be obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook (http://www.stats.gov.cn/sj/ndsj/ ) and each province's Statistical Yearbook. Moreover, the geographical distance between provincial capitals is represented by the spherical distance.   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Natural attribute: spatiotemporal characteristics of the TCEs in China China's total TCEs from 2000 to 2019 were calculated, and a map of chronological changes was created to accurately depict the spatiotemporal characteristics (Fig. 2  ). In total, China's TCEs rose in fluctuation from 29.59 × 106 t in 2000 to 170.56 × 106 t in 2019, with an average annual growth rate of 9.66%. Nevertheless, the TCEs declined in 2003 and experienced a slowdown in growth in 2008 and 2013, which could be attributed to SARS, the global financial crisis, and severe foggy weather, respectively. Taking into account the fact that China's economic growth has gradually slowed down since 2010, and the tourism industry has been seriously affected by the COVID-19 epidemic after 2020, we chose 2000–2010 and 2010–2019 as two control periods to conduct the relevant comparison. The average annual growth rate of TCEs was a faster-than-average 11.77% in 2000–2010. However, the average annual growth rate stood at 7.36% in 2010–2019. Compared to the first stage, the second stage had a slower growth rate, which demonstrated China's economic and environmental policies on energy saving and low-carbon development have started to show some effects over the years. According to the 7th Five-Year Plan and the Western Development Strategy, China's provinces were divided into eastern, central, and western regions (Table A2 ). The TCEs in these regions were consistent with the overall trend of total TCEs in China from 2000 to 2019. Among all the regions, the eastern region had the highest TCEs, which increased from 16.24 × 106 t in 2000 to 103.76 × 106 t in 2019, taking up 60.83% of the total TCEs (Fig. 2 ). The western region's TCEs exceeded that of the central region since 2014 and showed a continuous upward trend. Three sectoral changes of the TCEs in China were also depicted in Fig. 2 . It can be easily seen that TTP had the highest CO2  emissions, accounting for over 80% of the total TCEs each year. Additionally, it was observed that the TCEs of TAV, accounting for 15.2% in 2019 and 5.4% in 2009, had surpassed the TCEs of TAM since 2009. The average annual growth rate of the three sectors in the two stages was also calculated. Notably, the growth rate of TAV was the fastest one and had always an increasing trend, while the growth rates of TTP and TAM showed a decreasing trend from stage 1–2. Moreover, the average annual growth rate of TAM's emissions was negative in the second stage (Fig. 2 ). The reasons are as follows. First, accommodation-related enterprises may be more susceptible to the government's macro-control measures regarding energy saving and CO2  reduction. Second, new energy could be more widely used in the accommodation sector. Third, the concept of CO2  emission reduction could be more easily accepted by tourists when it is emphasized in accommodation establishments.  4.2 Social attribute: network clustering and inequality The gravity model was improved to create the spatial association matrix of TCEs based on the data from 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2019. In addition, the software Ucient 6.0 was utilized to create the topological map of the spatial network of these provinces in 2000, 2010, and 2019 (Fig. 3  ). The nodes in Fig. 3  represent each of the 30 provinces. The lines between nodes represent the association relationship of TCEs among provinces, with the arrow's direction indicating the TCEs' spillover relationship. Yellow indicates that no pointing arrow is received. As seen in Fig. 3 , the spatial relationship of TCEs between provinces was very close, and the TCEs' spatial network structure in China became more and more complex due to the increasingly dense network lines. This result could be explained by the gradual development of tourism in China.(1) Overall network characteristics    It can be easily seen that the network density rose in fluctuation from 0.183 to 0.246 and peaked at 0.246 in 2019 (Fig. 4  ). Moreover, the number of network associations increased from 159 in 2000 to 214 in 2019, which indicated a stronger and stronger spatial correlation of TCEs among provinces. However, there still was a significant gap between the maximum network associations of 214 and the maximum possible relationships of 870 (=29 × 30) in the overall network. The existing gap indicates that there is still much work to be done to enhance the spatial correlation of TCEs. The network hierarchy exhibited a downward trend from 0.437 in 2000 to 0.224 in 2019, which indicated no strict hierarchy and a more and more stable network. The significant fluctuation in the network hierarchy between 2010 and 2017 can be attributed to the persistent haze starting from 2012. The 2013 year had the highest smoggy days on average from 1961 (http://www.stats.gov.cn/sj/ndsj/ ). Consequently, tourists from other areas would likely avoid visiting provinces severely affected by smog, due to poor visibility and inconvenient transportation options. However, vigorous measures taken by governments at all levels helped drive down the network level after 2014 and stabilized after 2017 (Fig. 4 ). Since the rising network density multiplied by the resulting redundant relationships in the network, network efficiency indicators were used to control transmission costs and spillover costs between provinces. The network efficiency decreased from 0.756 in 2000 to 0.665 in 2019, indicating fewer redundant relationships, a stronger bidirectional spillover effect, and a more stable network structure. This shift can be partly attributed to the flourishing tourism, which has encouraged peripheral provinces to develop and leverage their tourism resources. Additionally, a robust infrastructure fostered inter-provincial exchanges and cooperation.(2) Centrality    The inequality of carbon emissions among different provinces in China can be most easily identified from centrality indicators. The centrality analysis of TCEs in each of China's provinces in 2000, 2010, and 2019 is presented in Fig. 5  . It can be easily seen that most provinces had an increasing degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality. Jiangsu, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhejiang had the above three indicators more than their respective average values (Fig. 5 ). This fact suggests that these provinces served as bridges, directly connecting with numerous other provinces. Therefore, the five regions could use the advantageous resources of other provinces, such as tourism professionals, tourism models, tourism investment, and industrial cooperation. Through the conduction effect of the TCEs spatial network, these provinces played a leadership role, which was in line with Fig. 3 . Their geographical location in the eastern region provided them with a solid economic foundation and innovative technology, facilitating the formation of cluster effects, information transfer, and resource accessibility. Consequently, they dominated the spatial relationship instead of being controlled by other provinces. Moreover, their poor energy self-sufficiency also boosted energy transactions with other regions and drove them to become major actors by establishing links. Among the 30 provinces, some regions such as Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Anhui, Hebei, and Liaoning hold lower rankings (Fig. 5 ). This result could be arising from their underdeveloped tourism infrastructure, which makes attracting capital from other regions fraught with difficulties. At the same time, weak connectivity with other provinces meant little spillover effect and limited access to information and resources from other provinces. Therefore, they were on the edge of the network (Fig. 3 ), controlled and dominated by other provinces. The other reasons might be related to the tourism resource endowment, geographical location, and economic level. In addition, other regions such as Fujian, Hubei, Shandong, and Inner Mongolia ranked in the relative middle position during 2000–2019, which meant they had increasing spatial spillovers and influences. It might be mainly because they have developed a unique form of tourism to attract investment from other provinces, share technologies, and connect with other provinces. For example, Inner Mongolia, with its expansive territory, wide longitudinal span, and numerous neighboring provinces, stood out among these regions. However, the Belt and Road policy has promoted regional integration, which strengthened the spatial correlation between Inner Mongolia and its neighboring provinces.(3) Spatial clustering    The blocks of the TCEs’ network in 2019 are shown in Fig. 6   and Table 3  . There were four blocks in total, with block I to IV comprising 10, 12, 3, and 5 provinces, respectively. Within the entire network, there were 214 associations, including 40 internal relationships and 174 external relationships (Table 3 ). Block I, block II, and block III exhibited a smaller ratio of actual to expected internal relationships. The number of relationships sent by block I or block II to the outside was significantly greater than the number of relationships received from the outside, which made themselves net spillover blocks. The relationships between block III receiving and sending were almost equal, which classified itself as a broker block. Conversely, block IV showed a higher ratio of actual to expected internal relationships. The number of relationships sent to the outside was much smaller than the number of relationships received from the outside, which made itself a net beneficiary block (Table 3 ). In summary, block I and block II contributed resources such as fossil energy, tourism expertise, special tourism formats, and tourist preference data to other blocks. Block III served as the bridge and intermediary within the TCEs’ spatial association network, facilitating frequent exchanges and collaborations with other provinces. Block IV leveraged the resources and information from other blocks to develop its tourism industry. The majority of provinces in block I and block II were located in the central and western regions. The large-scale development in the western region and the rise in the central region formed spillover effects. This fact might be primarily due to strategic initiatives that enabled resource transfer to other regions, industrial structure optimization, and enhanced inter-regional cooperation. Block IV, comprising the provinces in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze River Economic Belt, exhibited a developed economy and flourishing tourism industry. However, the separation between energy and service demand and supply required the heavy input of energy and tourism elements, which were the spillovers from other blocks. Even though Jiangsu and Zhejiang had lower TCEs, they still belonged to the net beneficiary block because of the integrated regional development of the Yangtze River Delta in 2010, the Development Plan of the Yangtze River Delta City Cluster in 2016, and their large number of 5A-level scenic spots. Fujian and Hubei belonged to the broker. The reasons were as follows. Fujian, bridging the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, is a major component of the economic zone located on the west side of the strait. In addition, Fujian was one of the cities planned for the “Belt and Road”, and Quanzhou in Fujian was also the starting point of the Maritime Silk Road. Hubei, with the implementation of the Central Rising Development Strategy in 2004, had a location advantage, connecting the energy-rich western region with the economically developed eastern region. The density matrix of the correlation network in 2019 was built to explore in-depth the spillover effect between blocks. As depicted in Table 4  , the density matrix was converted into an image matrix by setting the overall network density as the threshold. Its value was 1 when greater than the threshold, or 0, otherwise (Table 4 ). Block I and II, despite their abundant coal, oil, and gas resources, had slower economic development and energy demand, leading to spillovers to other blocks. Block III, characterized by weak internal links, extended relationships with both block II and IV, while also receiving relationships from block I. Block IV was more connected internally and affected by spillover relationships from other blocks, which made itself a typical net beneficiary block. The provinces within this block were central nodes in the TCEs' network and should be prioritized in the TCEs’ reduction measures.  4.3 Economic and humanistic attribute: driving effects based on the LMDI decomposition (1) Decomposition results at national level    The decomposition results of the TCEs' driving factors across two periods (2000–2010 and 2010–2019) using the LMDI are illustrated in Fig. 7  . It can be easily seen that China's TCEs increased by 140.96 × 106 t from 2000 to 2019, with growth of 60.39 × 106 t in stage 1 and 80.57 × 106 t in stage 2, respectively. The tourist scale was the primary driver, accounting for an increase of 231.96 × 106 t TCEs, with the effects of 74.43 × 106 t in stage 1 and 157.53 × 106 t in stage 2 and a total contributing percentage of 165% to the rise. It was followed by the tourism consumption level, which grew by 49.95 × 106 t TCEs. This growth was comprised of 15.82 × 106 t in stage 1 and 34.13 × 106 t in stage 2 and a total contribution of 35%. This growth could be attributed to China's rapidly developing economy and improving living standards, and increasing disposable income and leisure time (http://www.stats.gov.cn/sj/ndsj/ ). So, it can be concluded that the tourist scale and the tourism consumption level were decisive for the growth of TCEs in China. The third driver was the sectoral structure, which grew by 3.89 × 106 t TCEs, with a growth of 3.76 × 106 t in stage 1 and 0.13 × 106 t in stage 2 and a total contribution of 3%. Energy intensity and spatial structure were the inhibiting factors, with the former exhibiting a greater inhibitory effect. Owing to advancements in energy structure and utilization technology, energy intensity restrained 30.63 × 106 t TCEs in stage 1 and 89.41 × 106 t TCEs in stage 2, with a total contribution of −85% to the TCEs' growth. This result indicated that higher energy-use efficiency was critical for maintaining lower energy intensity and the TCEs’ reductions. In contrast, the spatial structure only reduced 24.79 × 106 t TCEs, with a reduction of 2.99 × 106 t in stage 1 and 21.80 × 106 t in stage 2 and a total contribution of −18%.(2) Provincial contribution to China's TCEs change    As shown in Fig. 8  , the TCEs increase resulting from all drivers were more obvious in 2010–2019 than in 2000–2010. All provinces, except for Shandong, propelled the national TCEs increase from 2010 to 2019. The latter stage (2010–2019) of each province's tourist scale contributed to a greater effect on their respective provincial TCEs than that in the first stage (2000–2010) (Fig. 8 ). Specifically, the contribution of tourist scale (P) to the TCEs increase was relatively larger in Guangdong (25.83 × 106 t), Beijing (18.23 × 106 t), Shanghai (19.53 × 106 t), and Sichuan (10.59 × 106 t) in 2010–2019 (Fig. 8 ). It might be arising from these facts that a robust local economy enabled Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai to receive a greater number of tourists, develop convenient transportation and provide quality reception capacity, and high service level of tourist destinations, which in return lead to high-energy consumption. In addition, Sichuan's attraction covered both the southwest and northwest regions because of the rich tourism resources and Chengdu's position as one of the central cities in the western region. At the same time, the choice of transportation exerted the biggest impact on the tourist scale. TCEs from TTP took up the largest share of the total TCEs (Table A3 ). Energy intensity (EI) represents tourism's dependence on energy consumption. The EI's inhibitory effect was significantly greater in the second stage than that in the first stage (Fig. 8 ). The role of energy intensity in Beijing and Guangdong changed from contributory in the first stage to inhibitory in the second stage. Furthermore, Guangdong, which had the largest inhibiting effect among all provinces, reduced 14 × 106 t TCEs in the second stage as it adopted the 12th Five-Year Energy Conservation Plan in June 2011 (http://stats.gd.gov.cn/ ). It is worth noting that Shanghai's energy intensity played an increasingly contributory role in both stages. This fact meant more energy-dependent and less efficient tourism in Shanghai. Shanghai was at the center of the entire TCEs' social network (Fig. 3 ). Apart from being easily accessible to information and resources, it also had a relatively developed economy and technology. Therefore, developed areas such as Shanghai need to leverage their economic and technological advantages to reduce energy consumption when developing tourism. Tourism consumption level (CE) in all provinces had an increasingly contributory effect on the TCEs’ growth in both stages (Fig. 8 ). As China developed, the per capita consumption of tourism rose from 709.33 Chinese Yuan (CNY) in 2000 to 1270.03 CNY in 2019 (Table A4 ). The provinces with stronger contributory effects were mainly in economically developed areas such as Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai and tourism resource-rich areas such as Sichuan and Hainan. Spatial structure of tourists (ST) had an overall inhibiting effect (-18%) on the TCEs' growth (Figs. 7 and 8 ). This result might be arising from the following facts. As shown in Table A5 , the shares of tourism revenue occupied in the total tourism revenue in 2000 were eastern (69.32%), central (16.49%), and western (14.19%) China. It meant that eastern China was the major tourist destination. But in 2019, the share of eastern China decreased to 41.43%, while the shares of the central and western regions increased to 27.06% and 31.51%, respectively. This fact indicates that with the development of the tourism market, the tourist destinations have expanded from the eastern region to the central and western regions. This equilibrium in spatial structure promotes the optimal allocation of resources and the improvement of efficiency in the entire tourism industry, thus generating an effect of inhibiting carbon emissions. Therefore, there were more and more provinces that had a greater inhibiting effect (<−1 × 106 t) on the TCEs’ growth. As shown in Fig. 9  , the provinces with a greater inhibiting effect were Guangdong (-3.79 × 106 t), Beijing (-3.1 × 106 t), and Shanghai (-2.47 × 106 t), in 2000–2010. But in 2010–2019, these provinces had a higher number, e.g., Shanghai (-15.2 × 106 t), Beijing (-10.86 × 106 t), Guangdong (-4.49 × 106 t), Liaoning (-2.43 × 106 t), Jiangsu (-1.88 × 106 t), and Heilongjiang (-1.55 × 106 t). It can be easily seen that these provinces were almost all in eastern China, which was similar to Chen et al. (2022) . The sectoral structure (SE) effects were isolated and depicted in Fig. 10  , due to their smallest contributions (3%) to China's TCEs growth (Fig. 7 ). It can be easily seen that the TTP in most provinces had an inhibiting effect on the TCEs growth from 2010 to 2019. This result made the contribution of sectoral structure to the TCEs growth in the second period weaker. Therefore, reducing the TCEs generated by the TTP was crucial to transforming the role of sectoral structure from a contributory factor to an inhibitory factor. Additionally, TAV in the provinces other than Tianjin (-0.0029 × 106 t) and Heilongjiang (-0.06 × 106 t), significantly raised the TCEs growth from the sectoral structure during 2010–2019. This result indicated that the energy structure of TAV was changing towards an unreasonable trend with high-energy consumption and generating more of TCEs.  4.4 Discussion Sustainable tourism attracts increasing scholars because this concept or idea was grouped into one of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 8.9, Fig. 1 ). However, this concept was not well explained, and still insufficient attention had been given to it. Thus, taking China as a case, we tried to analyze tourism's carbon reduction and sustainability by constructing an innovative analytical framework that incorporates the bottom-up accounting method, the improved gravity model, the SNA, and the LMDI. Compared to previous research results, the results obtained in this paper are accurate and reliable. For example, China's TCEs rose in fluctuation from 2000 to 2019, with an average annual growth rate of 9.66%, which was consistent with the findings of Xiong et al. (2022) , Zha et al. (2021) , and Luo et al. (2020) . The western region's TCEs exceeded that of the central region since 2014, which was consistent with the findings of Chen et al. (2022) . Thus, despite having a small emissions base, the western region called for stronger reduction measures due to its more fragile ecological environment. TTP had the largest CO2  emissions, accounting for over 80% of the total TCEs, which was in line with the results of these studies (Kuo and Chen, 2009 ; Shi and Wu, 2011 ; Chen et al., 2018 ). Thus, the TTP should be the primary focus for future TCE reduction efforts. Moreover, a more and more stable network was coming true, and the spatial association among provinces expanded from adjacent to non-adjacent provinces, which was in line with Wang et al. (2019) . Jiangsu, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhejiang played a leadership role in the spatial network structure, which was in line with Wang et al. (2019) . Last, Shanghai's energy intensity played an increasingly contributory effect on the TCEs' growth, which was in line with Chen et al. (2022) . However, it should be noteworthy that these related studies often focus on one aspect of the complex systems of the TCEs, such as the TCEs' spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, social network structure, driving mechanism, and so on. It is still insufficient to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth study on tourism's carbon emissions from all the perspectives mentioned above. Thus, this is the first attempt to complete the assessment of tourism carbon emissions from the comprehensive perspective in this paper. So, it has an innovative significance. Therefore, the gotten results of this paper can help us fully understand the natural, social, economic, and humanistic, etc., information of the TCEs and make better future planning for the tourism industry. There may be some limitations that exist in this paper. For example, only the three aspects of TTP, TAM, and TAV were estimated for the TCEs accounting, and the TCEs from private cars and other accommodation ways were not considered due to data unavailability, which may result in underestimation of the TCEs result. The parameters used in this study were obtained based on relevant research at home and abroad, which may apply to the overall level of China. However, they may introduce errors when used in different provinces due to the actual changing conditions. In future research, theoretical and scientific guidance should be provided to improve the corresponding parameters so that the estimated TCEs could be more accurate. In addition, some scholars have studied the CO2  emission coefficient of private cars in tourism destinations (Lin, 2010 ), which could also be a key direction for future research.   5 Conclusion and policy implications 5.1 Conclusion (1) China's TCEs had an overall growth trend, and it increased rapidly from 29.59 × 106 t in 2000 to 170.56 × 106 t in 2019, with an amount growth of 140.96 × 106 t and an average annual growth rate of 9.66%. China's eastern region had the highest share with 60.83% of the total national TCEs in 2019. The TCEs of China's western region exceeded those of the central region with an amount of 26.36 × 106 t after 2014.  (2) Structurally, the TCEs from TTP were the largest sector, accounting for more than 80% of the total TCEs each year. The TCEs' share from TAV rose from 5.4% in 2009 to 15.2% in 2019, surpassing that of TAM since 2009.  (3) The spatial network structure of TCEs was increasingly stable. Economically developed regions such as Jiangsu, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhejiang were at the center of the network, and they were in block Ⅳ. Block Ⅰ and block Ⅱ were net spillover blocks and mainly overflowed to other blocks, block Ⅲ and block Ⅳ belonged to the broker block and the net beneficiary block, respectively.  (4) Tourist scale and tourism consumption level contributed to 231.96 × 106 t and 49.95 × 106 t increase in the total TCEs' growth, with contributions of 165% and 35%, respectively. They were the decisive drivers for the growth of TCEs. The sector structure effect followed them, and it contributed to 3.89 × 106 t growth, with a contribution of 3%. On the contrary, energy intensity was the most main inhibiting factor. It contributed to −120.04 × 106 t growth, with a contribution of −85%. The spatial distribution structure followed it, and contributed to −24.79 × 106 t growth, with a contribution of −18%.    Overall, it can be easily concluded that the innovative sustainable tourism framework could be effectively and successfully applied in China's case.  5.2 Policy implications Therefore, based on these conclusions above, some practical policy suggestions to reduce tourism CO2  emissions could be proposed for the green or sustainable development of China's tourism. First, the overall growth trend of TCEs should be mitigated as much as possible. So, as the economy grows steadily, it is unfeasible to control the tourism consumption level by restricting the consumption of tourists. A better way is to actively guide and encourage people to form the habit of low-carbon tourism by strengthening publicity and education. Thus, it is recommended to incorporate the concept of low-carbon development into the national relevant laws and regulations of the tourism industry and establish a low-carbon tourism evaluation and certification system to assess the whole process of the tourism industry. For example, it is necessary, especially for Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhejiang, or Jiangsu, to leverage the comparative advantage of the eastern region's economy and technology to promote the development of clean energy and the innovation of pollution treatment technologies, with the support of government funding and policies. For the western region (i.e., Sichuan), the related infrastructure with more low-carbon technology and lower energy use should be introduced to enhance the development of green tourism. Second, tourism transport (TTP) should be the priority of TCEs' reduction. So, the government should advocate aviation CO2  reduction by optimizing and integrating the flights' routes, especially in the boom season of travel (i.e., May 1st and October 1st holidays), and promoting aviation energy-use efficiency. At the same time, the rail routes should also be optimized to promote the rail's energy-use efficiency. For example, traction devices that use new and higher efficient power sources (i.e., solar photovoltaic panels, wind and hydropower electricity) should be actively introduced in scenic high-speed rail routes. The way people travel should also be optimized to improve energy-use efficiency. For example, generally speaking, railway and flight should be encouraged for long-distance travel, and taking the bus or on foot should be encouraged for shorter distances. People should try to avoid traveling only by driving a car on the road. So, individual road CO2  taxes or driving purchase taxes could be suitably increased to alleviate CO2  emissions from road transportation. Third, block IV of the social network (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Yangtze River Economic Belt regions), especially Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Jiangsu, should be the priority and have a leading role in designing CO2  reduction measures for tourism. For example, these provinces should prioritize low-carbon tourism as an important indicator for evaluating tourism economic development by establishing relevant market and economic mechanisms. At the same time, they should enhance CO2  capture and sequestration technologies to strengthen CO2  absorption. For example, they could expand the green cover area through afforestation, returning lakes to forests, and so on. Furthermore, for the other provinces (i.e., Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei, etc.) located on the edge of the network, the administrative barriers should be broken through to build regional tourism economic circles. They should strengthen cooperation with the neighboring provinces in tourism development. The interaction among the different provinces was conducive to achieving coordinated emission reductions in the tourism industry. In addition, for areas (i.e., Ningxia) with weaker environmental carrying capacity, it is necessary to develop tourism resources tailored to the local conditions to promote sustainable tourism development. In this regard, it may be preferable to choose to develop natural or low-carbon attractions equipped with artificial intelligence facilities. Fourth, it is unrealistic to suppress tourism scale and consumption (Chen et al., 2018 ), so, reducing tourism's energy intensity is the focus of China's TCEs reduction. For example, the country should continue to encourage low-carbon development in various industries, including tourism and new energy vehicles. And, tourism enterprises should be particularly encouraged to introduce low-carbon facilities and projects to improve the technological innovation system and pull up energy-use efficiency. Furthermore, the economically developed provinces (i.e., Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Jiangsu) should make good use of their economic and technological advantages to achieve normalized low-carbon tourism. And, the poor regions (i.e., Ningxia, Qinghai, Xizang, and Hainan) should leverage their resource advantages to seek tourism investment and technology exchange from developed areas and promote low-carbon technologies' use. In addition, the equilibrium development in the spatial structure of tourist destinations should be pushed as early as possible. For example, some tourism resources with local characteristics (i.e., Jiangxi's historical revolutionary tradition and Yunnan's plateau ancient customs) can be developed as soon as possible.
