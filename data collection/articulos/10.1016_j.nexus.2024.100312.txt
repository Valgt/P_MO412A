                  Water scarcity poses a critical global challenge, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This paper introduces an innovative nexus approach to mitigate this issue through the integration of hydro panels in buildings, exploiting solar energy and atmospheric humidity to generate clean water. We offer a comprehensive review of the hydro panel technology's current state, exploring its potential, implementation challenges, and alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a bibliometric analysis. Our findings highlight a significant uptick in research on sustainable building technologies, positioning hydro panels at the nexus of solutions for water scarcity. Despite their promise, our analysis reveals a scarcity of focused research on hydro panels, indicating an emerging interest in leveraging smart city frameworks for environmental sustainability. The paper contributes by defining the technological trajectory and identifying gaps in existing research, emphasizing the hydro panels' potential to transform water accessibility in arid regions, especially when integrated with other sustainable technologies such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. This review not only underlines hydro panels as a novel solution but also paves the way for future investigations into their broader application within the nexus of sustainable urban development.

Water scarcity poses a critical global challenge, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This paper introduces an innovative nexus approach to mitigate this issue through the integration of hydro panels in buildings, exploiting solar energy and atmospheric humidity to generate clean water. We offer a comprehensive review of the hydro panel technology's current state, exploring its potential, implementation challenges, and alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a bibliometric analysis. Our findings highlight a significant uptick in research on sustainable building technologies, positioning hydro panels at the nexus of solutions for water scarcity. Despite their promise, our analysis reveals a scarcity of focused research on hydro panels, indicating an emerging interest in leveraging smart city frameworks for environmental sustainability. The paper contributes by defining the technological trajectory and identifying gaps in existing research, emphasizing the hydro panels' potential to transform water accessibility in arid regions, especially when integrated with other sustainable technologies such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. This review not only underlines hydro panels as a novel solution but also paves the way for future investigations into their broader application within the nexus of sustainable urban development.   Keywords Hydro panels  Water scarcity  Arid regions  Sustainable development  Atmospheric Water Generation  Solar Energy   Data availability Data will be made available on request.      I. introduction Water is a fundamental necessity for life, playing a critical role in economic development [1 ]. As the global population expands, the demand for water correspondingly increases [2 ], leading to water scarcity. This scarcity arises when the demand for water exceeds its available supply, appearing due to diverse reasons across different geographic and socioeconomic landscapes. Some regions such as the Middle East and North Africa are known to belong in the water-scarce region of the world [3 ]. The region only contains around 1.4 percent of the world's renewable fresh water. In arid and semi-arid regions, physical water scarcity is common. For example, countries like United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia face significant challenges in meeting their water demands due to naturally limited rainfall and scarce water resources [3 ,4 ]. Conversely, regions with abundant water resources might experience economic water scarcity. An example of this is seen in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such as Ethiopia and Tanzania, where the lack of infrastructure and investment in water technology limits access to water despite the availability of freshwater sources [5 ,6 ]. Additionally, some countries face environmental stress because of excessive water consumption, leading to environmental degradation. The Aral Sea basin, shared by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, serves as an example where intensive irrigation practices have not only depleted water resources but also led to significant ecological damage, affecting the availability of clean water for both human consumption and ecological sustainability [7 ]. Already by 2025, two thirds of the world's population could be living in water-stressed countries if current consumption patterns continue [8 ]. Hence, enhancing the efficiency and productivity of the water supplies is very essential [9 ].Therefore, ways to improve water resources conservation has become a hot topic for many policy makers and scholars [10 ]. Some of the primary sources and methods for obtaining water in these regions are groundwater, rainwater harvesting, desalination, recycled wastewater, importation, fog and dew harvesting, atmospheric water generation, and hydro panels. Each of these sources has its advantages and challenges, and the choice among them often depends on local conditions, including climate, geography, and economic factors. In arid and semi-arid regions, especially in coastal regions where traditional means of recharging surface water and groundwater are hindered by irregular and scarce precipitation, and high evaporation rates, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable water management. Solutions such as desalination, and the use of treated wastewater for irrigation and industrial purposes, are being explored and implemented to address these challenges. However, desalination faces significant environmental challenges, including high energy consumption, marine ecosystem disruption, and chemical pollution, alongside economic challenges due to substantial costs, necessitating innovative solutions for sustainability and cost-effectiveness [11 ]. In response to these challenges, atmospheric water generation (AWG), especially in coastal arid and semi-arid regions, offers a promising alternative. AWG technologies, such as hydro panels, draw moisture directly from the air and condense it into water. Hydro panels are a specific brand of AWG that uses solar energy to power the water extraction process, offering a sustainable, off-grid solution for water production. This approach provides a feasible solution even in dry conditions and is increasingly recognized for its ability to deliver clean, sustainable water without the significant energy costs and environmental impacts tied to desalination [12 ]. The concept of utilizing hydro panels capitalizes on renewable energy to extract water from the atmosphere, offering a sustainable and innovative solution to water scarcity [13 ]. This technology harnesses solar power to generate electricity, which in turn powers the hydro panels to condense moisture from the air into water. This approach does not only provide a sustainable source of clean water but also reduces the energy footprint, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions [14 ]. As populations in water-stressed countries continue to rise, the demand for new housing projects escalates, presenting a unique challenge for sustainable development. This rise in population and housing needs amplifies the strain on already scarce water resources, underscoring the necessity for innovative solutions to ensure water security. One such promising approach is the integration of hydro panels in buildings, a strategy that not only addresses the urgent need for water but also aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to clean water and sanitation (Goal 6), affordable and clean energy (Goal 7), and sustainable cities and communities (Goal 11) (United Nations, 2015). Therefore, integrating hydro panels into buildings in these regions represents an innovative step forward. By embedding this technology within the infrastructure, buildings can autonomously produce drinking water, significantly reducing reliance on traditional water sources and energy-intensive desalination processes. Research into AWG technologies indicates their crucial role in mitigating water scarcity and highlights their effectiveness in capturing atmospheric moisture across diverse climatic conditions [15 ,16 ]. The adoption of such groundbreaking technologies emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive and innovative approach to water scarcity that considers both immediate and long-term sustainability. Integrating renewable energy sources with water procurement technologies like hydro panels enables solving water scarcity by employing a model of water resource management that is both sustainable and environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the integration of AWG technologies into building facades represents an underexplored area with substantial potential for innovative contributions. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the integration of hydro panels in buildings as a viable solution to address water scarcity in arid regions. Through a technological and bibliometric analysis, we seek to evaluate the current state, potential, and implementation challenges of hydro panel technology. Additionally, the study aims to explore how this innovative approach aligns with SDGs, highlighting its significance in promoting water security and sustainable urban development. The paper tries to investigate the role of the use of AWG technologies as a solution for water scarcity, paving the way for future research on their application within sustainable building technologies.  2 Theoretical background 2.1 Sustainable practices in buildings Sustainable practices in building design and construction are increasingly becoming important to address environmental, economic, and social challenges. Among various sustainable technologies, the potential integration of hydro panels into building practices offers a promising solution for enhancing building sustainability. [17 ] discusses the integration of hydronic heating/cooling systems with building thermal mass to enhance energy efficiency through the optimized use of sustainable technologies. Their work underscores the importance of incorporating sustainable practices in the design process to achieve high-performance architecture. The exploration of Small Hydro Power (SHP) in India by [18 ] provides insights into the economic and environmental sustainability of renewable energy generation, suggesting that similar principles can be applied to the integration of hydro panels in buildings for sustainable water and energy generation [19 ] emphasize the benefits of integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) and sustainability practices in construction projects. Their findings support the notion that sustainable building functions, including those facilitated by hydro panels, can significantly enhance project quality and efficiency through improved building performance simulation and design optimization [19 ]. Furthermore, a study proposes a sustainable technology framework for energy and environmental building design, illustrating how buildings can produce their own energy and manage waste efficiently through the integration of innovative technologies such as hydro panels[20 ]. Sustainable building practices involve designing, constructing, and operating buildings in ways that reduce negative impacts on the environment and human health, while promoting economic viability and comfort for occupants. These practices encompass a wide range of strategies and techniques, including:I. Energy Efficiency: Implementing design and technologies that minimize energy consumption, such as high-efficiency HVAC systems, LED lighting, and energy management systems [21 ].  II. Water Efficiency: Using water-saving fixtures, rainwater harvesting systems, and efficient landscaping to reduce water usage [22 ].  III. Materials and Resources: Choosing sustainable building materials that are recycled, renewable, or have low environmental impact. This also includes minimizing waste during construction [23 ].  IV. Indoor Environmental Quality: Ensuring adequate ventilation, using low-emission materials, and maximizing natural light to create healthy indoor environments [24 ].  V. Renewable Energy Use: Incorporating renewable energy sources like solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal systems to reduce dependency on fossil fuels [25 ]  VI. Sustainable Site Selection and Management: Choosing building sites that minimize environmental disruption and designing landscapes that support local ecology [26 ].  VII. Transportation: Encouraging the use of public transportation, biking, and walking by selecting sites that are accessible and designing adequate facilities [27 ].  VIII. Building Design and Modeling: Utilizing advanced design and modeling tools to optimize the building's environmental performance, including its orientation, shape, and façade design [28 ]  IX. Operational and Maintenance Practices: Implementing strategies for efficient building operation and maintenance to sustain its performance over time [29 ].  X. Certification Systems: Following established certification frameworks like LEED, BREEAM, or Green Star to guide and validate the sustainability of building projects [30 ].    These practices are designed to ensure that buildings are resource-efficient, environmentally responsible, and provide safe and comfortable spaces for occupants, contributing to the broader goals of sustainability and climate change mitigation. The integration of sustainable building practices is a comprehensive approach to minimizing the environmental impact of buildings while enhancing their efficiency and occupant well-being. Two key aspects of sustainable building, energy efficiency and water efficiency, stand out for their potential integration into the application of hydro panels in building facades.  2.2 Hydro panels technology and implementation Hydro panels, also known as atmospheric water generators or water-from-air devices, or water capturing devices from air, offer a revolutionary solution to address water scarcity in arid and hot climate zones. These innovative systems capitalize on two abundant resources prevalent in such regions: humidity in the air and solar energy. By combining these elements, hydro panels can produce potable water, providing a sustainable and decentralized approach to meet water demand [31 ]. The operation of hydro panels relies on a straightforward principle: they extract moisture from the surrounding air, which is then condensed and purified to create safe, clean drinking water [32 ]. The technology used in hydro panels allows them to function even in low humidity conditions, making them viable for a wide range of environments, particularly in regions with challenging access to conventional water sources [33 ]. Hydro panels are advanced atmospheric water generators that employ hygroscopic materials or condensation techniques to capture water vapor from the air. These devices harness solar energy to drive the condensation process, making them not only efficient but also environmentally friendly. The core technology involves a two-stage process: first, air is drawn into the panel where water vapor is absorbed or condensed; then, the water is extracted and purified, ready for consumption [34 ]. Advances in materials science, particularly in the development of more effective hygroscopic materials and coatings, have significantly enhanced the water capture efficiency of these panels [35 ,36 ]. Hydro panels, shown in Fig. 1  , are powered by solar energy. The mechanism of the panels works through several stages. Firstly, the air gets collected into a unit with the help of a fan. Then, hygroscopic special materials absorb the water contents, after which the water vapor is collected when the natural airflow passes through a closed condenser. Finally, the reservoir is mineralized with calcium and magnesium to improve the taste, which is monitored by sensors in each hydro panel to optimize and maintain the water quality [37 ]. As an example, for a standard fixed installation for a hydro panel design by a company named SOURCE, the system consists of two hydro panels, and has a maximum capacity of 60 liters per day, and a lifespan of 15 years. However, the panels produce a minimum of 4–10 liters a day, which amounts to supply efficiently for 4 people, see [38 ]. The efficiency of hydro panels is influenced by several factors including humidity, temperature, and solar irradiance. High humidity levels and warmer temperatures typically result in higher water production rates. Fig. 2   shows a diagram of how the quantity of water produced (Liters) is directly proportional to the humidity levels [39 ,40 ]. Hence, Humidity categories can be divided into the following as summarized in Fig. 2 :1. Low Humidity: Typically, humidity levels below 30 % are considered low. In arid regions or during winter months, humidity can drop to even lower levels.  2. Comfortable Humidity: Humidity levels between 30 % to 50 % are usually considered comfortable for most people. This range provides a good balance between dryness and moisture.  3. High Humidity: Humidity levels above 50 % can be perceived as high. In tropical or coastal 2regions, humidity can often reach higher levels, especially during the rainy season.    Limited research has been conducted to explore the integration of hydro panels as a solution to water scarcity in hot climate zones, Some scholars have recently searched into various aspects related to the well-known solar panel technology, examining its practical implementations, performance under different environmental conditions, potential challenges, and its overall impact on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined by the United Nations (UN) [41 ] [42 ]. However, hydro panels operate on a similar basis, and is considered a new technology, where there is a research gap found that need further investigation. Only one applied example was found, where hydro panels were integrated in the façade of a building in Qatar, as discussed in Section 2.3 . While numerous studies have focused on the technical aspects of hydro panels and their functionality in extracting water from the atmosphere, limited attention has been given to the application of integrating this technology into facades of buildings and understanding the social and economic implications of widespread hydro panel implementation. Investigating the public perception, social acceptance, and economic viability of adopting hydro panels on a larger scale are vital components for successful integration [43 ]. A study found that implementing a water-from-air technology would have a huge impact of the water-energy-nexus [39 ]. Such a technique can be performed by utilizing hydro panels. Applications of the hydro panels were used in a case study, conducted in a university in Muscat, Oman. Hence, their results would be considered as a local case, with similar circumstances of belonging to the water arid countries. After conducting the procedure, great results were reported of 1200 liters per day produced from the 120 installed hydro panels. They also reached their breakeven point in less than 17 months, since their studied results showed that the college will be able to save 8069 kWhb of energy in the 15 years of the hydro panel's lifetime [40 ]. Hence, integrating renewable energy technologies into building facades, including hydro panels, represents a significant advancement in bridging architectural innovation with sustainability efforts aimed at combating climate change and reducing emissions. This approach not only enhances the energy efficiency of buildings but also contributes positively to their aesthetic appeal and functional design. Advancements in solar energy systems, for instance, have facilitated the seamless incorporation of photovoltaic technologies into building facades, skylights, and roofing, addressing architectural challenges and significantly boosting the energy efficiency and aesthetics of structures. Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) systems offer a dual-functional solution, serving both as energy generators and thermal regulators, which improves the building's overall energy performance [44 ]. Notably, Building-integrated PV/thermal (BIPV/T) systems combine electricity generation with heat collection functions. These systems convert a portion of solar energy into electricity and use the remainder for heating, enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings and marking a step towards zero-energy building achievements [45 ]. The development of customizable solar facade panels provides architects and designers with the flexibility to integrate solar energy generation into various architectural styles without compromising aesthetic values. This adaptability allows for the creation of innovative applications, such as three-dimensional facades with individually tilted panels, demonstrating the potential for personalized and efficient solar energy solutions [46 ]. The sophisticated integration of photovoltaics into building envelopes, such as window facades and curtain walls, has become more advanced, allowing buildings to generate energy while maintaining aesthetic and structural integrity. Additionally, algae-based facade systems present an innovative approach to energy generation, carbon dioxide absorption, and oxygen production[47 ]. By cultivating algae within the facade, which can then be harvested for biofuel production or other uses, these systems offer a sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources, contributing to the building's energy efficiency and ecological footprint reduction [48 ]. These advancements underscore the growing importance of integrating renewable energy technologies into the architecture of buildings to achieve sustainability and energy efficiency. The field continues to evolve, driven by technological innovations and the urgent need for sustainable construction practices. Supported by academic references, this discussion highlights the critical role of renewable energy integrations in modern and future architectural designs [45,49 ]. However, the efficiency of hydro panels is subject to location-specific factors, and the initial costs and maintenance requirements should be carefully considered before implementation.  2.3 Case study: application of hydro panels in the façade of building in Qatar With any new technology certain arguments such as cost, liability, and resilience evolve. Thus, a strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) performance analysis was conducted in one research done by Tan et al. in 2020, which analyzed the life cost for the hydro panel system. It found that with a 15-year life, and an initial amount of around $5500 for the standard fixed 2 hydro panels, including shipping, installation, and tax. The produced results would be around 12 standard water bottles for less than $0.15 per 500 mL bottle [50 ]. Another successful case of a water droplet resort shown in Fig. 3  , which is in Qatar, and resort is a water generating building that used hydro panels and placed them on the façade's side facing the sun the most. And they were able to produce 5000 liters daily which is enough for 48 people considering that one person uses 105 liters of water a day. However, in addition to the hydro panels, they also used desalination systems placed underwater since the building is immerged into water [51 ]. Hence, the utilization of hydro panels in the facades of buildings could be a key solution to the water scarcity problem. And could hold the potential to achieve a design of a self-sufficient city/urban center that does not need to depend on the immense desalination strategies that are eventually harmful for our environment [52 ].  2.4 The potential use of hydro panels in hot arid zones: the case of UAE The UAE, a nation recognized for its rapid growth and development, unfortunately is among the countries that suffer from a lack of sufficient quantities of water resources [53 ]. The UAE's arid climate and inconsistent rainfall increases the severity of water scarcity, making it a critical problem demanding immediate attention [50 ]. Addressing this pressing issue requires innovative and sustainable solutions that harness the country's abundant solar energy and atmospheric humidity. Hydro panels, a technology gaining momentum in recent years, present a promising approach to mitigate water scarcity challenges in the UAE [54 ] and in other countries in arid or semi-arid regions . Hence, the UAE belongs to the category of water-scarce countries as indicated. The categorized countries are based on those that have less than 1000 m3 of renewable fresh water per person per year which makes them belong to the water scarce category. The UAE specifically has a total amount of less than 200m3/capita [55 ]. The UAE belongs to the developing countries category and its water demand is expected to increase by 40 % by 2050 shown in Fig. 4  . Since the UAE suffers from a lack of sufficient quantities of water resources, sustainable development is hence at risk. Fig. 5   shows how the water resources are distributed in the UAE. The irrigation resources in the UAE currently have three major resources. Groundwater of about 4052 million mᵌ, which contributes to 70 %, desalinated water of 950 million mᵌ, being 24 %, and 6 % of treated wastewater of 319 million mᵌ, [56 ,57 ]. Heavy groundwater pumping also deteriorates the groundwater levels (Britannica 2021). A study [58 ] found that due to the excess pumping of groundwater for irrigation purposes, the average groundwater flow has decreased by one tenth in the last three decades. They used the software MODFLOW to stimulate the groundwater in their studied area during different times, including future scenarios of up to the year 2030 in their stimulations. The results showed that the current extraction rates need to be reduced by at least 25 % to achieve the acceptable sustainable development in the country [58 ]. The shortage of groundwater leads to more desalination and the reuse of treated wastewater which is not considered the best [59 ]. In addition, 24 % of UAE water is coming from desalination. This reliance on energy-intensive desalination processes cannot be considered a long-term solution to water scarcity since they have a negative impact on the environment, since producing 1000 liters of water requires around 2.5 to 10 KWh (Department of Energy (DOE)) (Water Resources Management UAE). Continuing to reduce the water storage will further hinder the country's development. There is a significant impact of the country's arid climate on the availability of the water resources [60 ]. For instance, as a primary source of recharging surface water and groundwater, rainfall is scarce and extremely irregular in time and space in the UAE. Also, there is an extremely high amount of evaporation in the country due to the extremely high temperatures, which reduces the amount of surface water [55 ,61 ]. Hence, taking the insufficient amounts of water availability into account, we can conclude that the continued use of water without finding a solution for its replacement will result in hindering the development in the county. Furthermore, the water resources in the Gulf region are subjected to a great depletion, specifically by the agriculture sector [62 ]. One temporary solution could be to develop ways to improve water management practices. However, this would only put a pause to the inevitable result of water reduction [63 ]. Therefore, searching for a new untraditional resource is necessary [55 ]. Fig. 6   shows the average relative humidity in three cities within the UAE: Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai. The graph demonstrates that the relative humidity in these cities remains above 50 % throughout the year. This makes the use of hydro panels a suitable, sustainable solution to be applied. In summary, hydro panels could provide a cutting-edge solution to the UAE's water challenges by producing water sustainably, reducing the environmental footprint, and enhancing water security in the face of climate change and increasing demand.   3 Methodology In this study, bibliometric tools were used to analyze literature that was published about hydro panels and SDG11, i.e., Sustainable Cities and Communities. The main key words used to search along with the 11th SDG about smart cities, were hydro panels, humidity, water scarcity, solar panels, solar photovoltaic, and concentrated solar power (CSP). We used quantitative analysis methods to gain insights into the depth of research done in this research's specific area. Hence, discovering any gaps in terms of research patterns that could be developed. Text mining was used in addition to include thematic fields, key words, and top authors and countries publishing. The bibliographic database was extracted from Scopus platform on July 19,2023. Scopus provides access to a vast collection of peer-reviewed scholarly literature from various disciplines. The bibliometric methodology utilized in this study is divided into two steps: Data collection and data analysis as summarized in Fig. 7  . 3.1 Data collection and search strategy An advanced search query was conducted in Scopus to collect relevant literature. The total number of publications generated from the search query as shown in Fig. 7 , was 12,153. Hence, to make the results as specific and relative as possible, the publications were limited to only journals and articles. In addition, unrelated fields such as medical terms, mathematics, and biochemistry, etc., were excluded. Lastly, the time frame was restricted, making the scope of the publication years ranging from 2015 to 2024. Thus, the resulting publications were reduced to a total of 2244.  3.2 Data management and statistical analysis 3.2.1 Text mining through VOSviewer software The total publications’ databases were extracted and analyzed using two methods: text mining and the Bibliometric package. The text mining was done through the VOSviewer software, where the results of different collaborations or co-occurrence network for different parameters such as authors, countries, and index words were shown, each result showing different visual overlay to have a specific analysis. To achieve a map of vast thematic hotspots of the Scopus research, 202 keywords meeting the threshold with at least 43 occurrences were selected out of the 18,065 keywords, to calculate the total strength of the co-occurrence links with other keywords. These keywords were then selectively filtered out based on excluding genetic and non-thematic index words (e.g., human, gender, age, and others), as well as country, journal, and article names to provide concise results of the research hotspot. In addition, similar spellings of terminologies were merged using the VOSviewer thesaurus functionality. The generated results showed a map indicating the strength of the co-occurrence in the same publication through the distance between the index words. Finally, color-coded clusters of 4 maps were generated with a level-1 resolution.  3.2.2 Biblioshiny software The Biblioshiny software was used through the Bibliometrix package in R. The extracted Scopus data was first converted into a Bibliometrix file by Biblioshiny, and chart creation in Microsoft Excel 2022 for further science mapping analysis. Hence, the software provides a wide range of metrics and visualization tools for bibliographic data including articles, journals, and different authors to show trends and mappings of co-citations, co-word, and collaboration networks. However, there were some limitations in the study, such as the limited number of studies available since the evolution of hydro panels is considered recent, and the need for more research to determine the long-term impact of hydro panels on water resources is necessary to see how successful some cases are. Future research could focus on the development of specific strategies for implementing hydro panels in the facades in the UAE.    4 Results and discussion 4.1 Recent progress Globally, there were 2244 publications after selective filtering on Scopus database’ search query regarding the following keywords: SDG, Hydro-panels, Solar PV, Photovoltaics, CSP Solar and Water scarcity. The time frame was restricted to the last 8 years, i.e., from 2015 to 2024.

The water generated by these systems should meet the required quality standards for consumption and other applications. Additionally, the taste and mineral content of the water can vary based on environmental factors and the efficiency of the hydro panels [69 ]. Ensuring that the water is safe, palatable, and suitable for various uses is essential for gaining public trust and acceptance of the technology [70 ]. Addressing these technical challenges demands ongoing research, development, and collaboration between engineers, researchers, and manufacturers. Continuous improvement and innovation in hydro panel technology are crucial to enhance efficiency, reliability, and water quality, making them a more effective and viable solution for addressing water scarcity in arid climates like the UAE.  4.3.3 Environmental and social challenges Used query string: TITLE-ABS-KEY (((“SDG No. 11″) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (hydro OR "Hydro Panels" OR "Hydro Panel" OR humidity OR "water Scarcity" OR "Lack of Water" OR "Solar Panel" OR "Solar PV" OR photovoltaic OR "Concentrated Solar Power" OR "CSP solar") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (Environment* OR emission*). The environmental and social challenges related to the implementation of hydro panels as a solution for water scarcity in arid regions are significant factors to consider. One of the primary environmental challenges is water availability. Hydro panels rely on atmospheric humidity to extract water, and their effectiveness is influenced by local environmental conditions, such as humidity levels and air moisture content. In arid climates like the UAE, where water scarcity is a pressing concern, the availability of atmospheric moisture becomes critical. While the UAE has relatively consistent humidity levels throughout most of the year, there might be fluctuations during specific periods. Addressing this challenge requires careful monitoring of environmental factors and considering alternative water sources during periods of lower humidity [71 ]. On the social front, the acceptance and perception of hydro panels as a viable solution for water scarcity pose significant challenges. The success of any technology implementation depends on how it is perceived and accepted by the public. Hydro panels, being a relatively new and innovative technology, may face skepticism and resistance from some segments of the population. Educating the public about the benefits and potential of hydro panels, as well as addressing any misconceptions or concerns, is crucial for fostering widespread acceptance. Public awareness campaigns, community engagement initiatives, and transparent communication can help build trust and understanding among the population [70 ]. Moreover, social challenges may also arise from cultural and behavioral factors. In some communities, traditional water collection methods or established water sources may hold cultural significance and adopting new technologies like hydro panels could require overcoming cultural barriers. Engaging with local communities, understanding their specific needs and preferences, and involving them in the decision-making process can aid in overcoming such challenges. Overcoming environmental and social challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that includes technical improvements in hydro panel design, continuous monitoring of environmental conditions, effective public outreach, and collaboration with local communities and stakeholders[72 ].  4.3.4 Policies and regulations challenges Used query string: TITLE-ABS-KEY ((“SDG No. 11″) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (hydro OR "Hydro Panels" OR "Hydro Panel" OR humidity OR "water Scarcity" OR "Lack of Water" OR "Solar Panel" OR "Solar PV" OR photovoltaic OR "Concentrated Solar Power" OR "CSP solar") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (Policy OR Policies OR Policymaker* OR regulation*). The successful integration of hydro panels into building facades as a solution for water scarcity depends heavily on the development and implementation of appropriate policies and regulations. A well-defined regulatory framework is essential to promote the widespread adoption of this technology. Supportive policies can encourage investors, building owners, and developers to consider hydro panels as a viable option for water supply and conservation. The regulatory framework should include clear guidelines and procedures for obtaining permits and approvals for installing hydro panels on buildings. These guidelines can help streamline the process and provide clarity to stakeholders, making it easier to navigate through the bureaucratic processes involved in adopting new technologies. Standardization of installation procedures and performance requirements can also ensure uniformity and reliability across different installations [73 ]. Compliance with existing building codes and safety standards is critical to the successful implementation of hydro panels. Ensuring that installations meet all safety requirements protects the public and minimizes potential risks associated with the technology. Building codes should be updated or adapted to incorporate provisions specifically related to hydro panels, addressing factors such as load-bearing capacity, structural integrity, and fire safety [74 ]. To develop effective policies and regulations, collaboration among government agencies, industry experts, and relevant stakeholders is vital. The input and expertise of researchers, engineers, and manufacturers can help in crafting well-informed regulations that strike a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding public welfare. Additionally, policies can include incentives such as tax benefits, subsidies, or grants to promote the adoption of hydro panels. Financial incentives can help offset the initial investment costs, making the technology more attractive to potential users and accelerating its uptake [75 ]. Regular reviews and updates of policies and regulations are necessary to keep pace with advancements in hydro panel technology and the evolving needs of the region. Flexibility in the regulatory approach can allow for continuous improvement and adaptation to changing circumstances [37 ].  4.3.5 Administrative and institutional challenges Used query string: TITLE-ABS-KEY ((“SDG No. 11″) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (hydro OR "Hydro Panels" OR "Hydro Panel" OR humidity OR "water Scarcity" OR "Lack of Water" OR "Solar Panel" OR "Solar PV" OR photovoltaic OR "Concentrated Solar Power" OR "CSP solar") AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Administrative*” OR Institutional*”). The administrative and institutional challenges surrounding the large-scale implementation of hydro panels require a collaborative and coordinated approach among various stakeholders. Effective coordination between government agencies, building owners, manufacturers, researchers, and other relevant parties is crucial to overcome potential bottlenecks and streamline the adoption process. Clear communication channels and collaborative platforms can facilitate the exchange of information, ideas, and best practices, enabling stakeholders to work together towards a common goal. ("World Air Quality Report," 2021) Capacity building is another essential aspect to address administrative and institutional challenges.
