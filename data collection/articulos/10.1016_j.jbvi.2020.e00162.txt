                  Research on societal grand challenges has become a major theme in management research. Societal grand challenges require joint efforts by private, public, and social sector organizations and are described in the framework of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One major contributor to this framework are social entrepreneurial ventures. Aligning their interventions and indicators with the SDGs can provide them with great benefits such as facilitating resource mobilization and increasing legitimacy among stakeholders. The majority of research on SDGs tends to understand the SDG framework as inherently good, as a powerful compass and narrative to create social value and take action. However, taking-for-granted that social entrepreneurial ventures readily materialize the SDGs seems to neglect the question of whether they accept the framework and how an utilization may differ among them. Drawing on qualitative interviews of 15 social entrepreneurial ventures, we address this gap and identify three distinct types of SDG utilization, namely SDG evangelism, SDG opportunism, and SDG denial. Our study contributes to research on the intersection of social entrepreneurship and societal grand challenges by uncovering the roles of resourcefulness and deviance in SDG utilization. Furthermore, we identify trust between the United Nations and social entrepreneurial ventures as a determinat for SDG utilization and provide several practical implications.

Keywords Societal grand challenges  Social entrepreneurial ventures  Sustainable Development Goals  Utilization    1 Introduction Since its approval in 2015 by the United Nations’ (UN) member states, the SDG framework has become a pivotal point in discussions and policy work for addressing societal grand challenges (George et al., 2016 ; Griggs et al., 2013 ). Previous studies (Littlewood and Holt, 2018 ) and practitioner work have emphasized the “important role that social enterprises and businesses with a social purpose can play in driving sustainable and inclusive development, tackling inequality, and helping to address some of the biggest challenges targeted by the UNs’ Sustainable Development Goals” (Social Enterprise UK, 2015 : 4). The SDG framework calls for cross-sectorial collaborations that require global and local partners to converge on a set of goals assumed to be important and legitimate. For social entrepreneurial ventures, the ambitions of the SDG framework require them to engage and contribute with their local knowledge and adaptive and innovative capacities. As such, the framework also promises great benefits for social entrepreneurial ventures, such as strengthening their relationships to stakeholders by increasing the legitimacy of their social activities and facilitating resource mobilization by bundling their activities for addressing the SDGs collectively (Grodal and O’Mahony, 2017 ; Castellas and Ormiston, 2018 ). Research on societal grand challenges is still in its infancy (Ferraro et al., 2015 ; Littlewood and Holt, 2018 ). Analyzing institutional and organizational success factors and strategies to address the SDGs, the majority of this research tends to understand the SDG framework as inherently good and to be taken-for-granted by the organizations for which it was designed (e.g., Moon, 2018 ; Schaltegger et al., 2018 ). However, despite their valuable contributions, scholars have so far largely neglected the critical question of whether and how social entrepreneurs actually utilize the SDG framework to further their pro-social agendas and to solve social problems. By employing an inductive research design based on qualitative interviews of 15 prolific social entrepreneurs in Germany, our study addresses this gap and investigates how social entrepreneurial ventures utilize the framework. Our findings outline a heterogenous view of how an arguably useful resource such as the SDG framework is alternatively used, revealing (i) three distinct SDG utilization types as well as showing (ii) resourcefulness and deviance of the social entrepreneurial ventures’ actions in the presence of the vaguely formulated SDG framework. The current study contributes to the management literature on societal grand challenges and SDGs by providing insights into an important and challenging gap that has arisen between the SDGs, which address governments, corporations, and large-scale NGOs at the macro-level, and the objectives and activities of social entrepreneurs at the micro-level. Our findings reveal the need for local and national governments as well as international bodies to localize their efforts at the intersection of the SDG framework and the social entrepreneurs, mainly in order to realize social entrepreneurs’ potential as major contributors to achieving the SDGs.  2 SDGs, societal grand challenges, and social entrepreneurial ventures The SDGs have become the most universal and widely adopted framework of the societal grand challenges of our time (George et al., 2016 ; Venkatesh et al., 2017 ), to which the UNs’ 193 member states politically agreed upon in a historic summit in 2015. Committing to “mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind” (United Nations, 2019 ), the SDGs set a global social and environmental responsible agenda to be achieved by 2030 (Littlewood and Holt, 2018 ). The SDGs consist of 17 goals with 169 associated targets for both developing and developed countries (Sachs, 2012 ). Research on social entrepreneurship and the SDGs has taken a positive stance, generally assuming the SDGs to be inherently good for social entrepreneurship (Tucker et al., 2019 ). Consequently, the relationship between the SDGs and social entrepreneurial ventures has been conceptualized as highly synergetic (Littlewood and Holt, 2018 ). On the one hand, meeting the SDGs requires social entrepreneurial ventures to address social needs and find innovative solutions to small- and large-scale societal problems (Markman et al., 2016 ; Venkatesh et al., 2017 ). Employing different organizational or legal forms (Bacq and Janssen, 2011 ; Choi and Majumdar, 2014 ) and using diverse business models (Dohrmann et al., 2015 ; Raith and Siebold, 2018 ; Siebold et al., 2019 ) , social entrepreneurial ventures often have the flexibility and innovativeness that allows them to create and pursue opportunities to catalyze social change and scale solutions to maximize impact (Chliova and Ringov, 2017 ; Wry and Zhao, 2018 ). As new social entrepreneurial ventures are less invested in the status quo and unlimited by established organizational routines, culture, and modes of thinking, they are more likely to generate new innovative solutions to help meet the SDGs than established organizations (Bacq and Janssen, 2011 ; Barth et al., 2015 ; Friedman and Desivilya, 2010 ; Perrini et al., 2010 ; Smith and Stevens, 2010 ). Especially their propensity to operationalize the SDGs into the specific local context has been highlighted as a strength (Littlewood and Holt, 2018 ). On the other hand, the SDGs can represent a potential benefit and resource for social entrepreneurial ventures. Firstly, the alignment of organizational activities and outcomes with the SDGs could benefit social entrepreneurial ventures by causing collective action that increases their legitimacy and facilitates resource mobilization (Grodal and O’Mahony, 2017 ). Secondly, an implementation of the SDGs and associated targets may help social entrepreneurial ventures and their stakeholders to understand interrelations and identify complementarities or trade-offs among goals while focusing their efforts effectively (Martí, 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ; Stechow et al., 2016 ). Thirdly, the SDGs represent a generally established and accepted platform which may facilitate communication of the activities and ambitions of the social entrepreneurial ventures, potentially helping them develop better relationships with stakeholders (Schaltegger et al., 2018 ). This potential synergy between the social entrepreneurial ventures and the SDGs, however, can only be realized if the social entrepreneurs actively utilize the SDGs. Yet, we know very little about the SDGs, as viewed from the perspective of social entrepreneurial ventures. This perspective does not necessarily take for granted the inherent relevance and goodness of the SDGs, but instead emphasizes the realities of how the SDGs become materialized and operationalized in the mundane efforts of localized social entrepreneurial ventures. Realizing the assumed potential synergy between the SDGs and social entrepreneurial ventures depends on the social entrepreneurs knowing of, approving of, and actually materializing the SDGs in their daily effort to create social value. We aim to fill this important research gap by empirically investigating the following research question: How do social entrepreneurial ventures utilize the SDGs to create social value?  3 Method An interview study was conducted in order to analyze the utilization of the SDG framework by 15 prolific social entrepreneurs and their ventures. We focused our study on the Berlin region in Germany, which is generally considered a thriving hub for social entrepreneurship. Local organizations, including the local social entrepreneurship association, the TU Berlin, and the University of Potsdam, assisted in identifying successful social entrepreneurial ventures with a proven record of developing initiatives in SDG-related areas such as equality, climate change, immigration, and social integration. Initially, 28 social entrepreneurial ventures were identified in this manner. We contacted all of them via e-mail and, after pre-screening, 18 were finally selected for interviews. The deselection of 10 social entrepreneurial ventures was required due to recent relocation outside Germany, organizational change in mission away from social objectives as well as unavailability of interview partners. We later further omitted three cases as they had never heard of the SDGs. Table 1   provides an overview of the final 15 case ventures in our sample of which we interviewed the (co)founders and acting CEOs. The selected social entrepreneurial ventures employ different organizational forms (non-profit, for-profit, and hybrid), make use of different business models, and vary both in age (between two and nine years of operation) and in size (between two and 35 employees). Our specific sampling criteria were derived from our research question: (1) all cases are entrepreneurial ventures primarily focused on achieving social goals; (2) all cases work within areas related to the SDGs; and (3) all cases are well-known in the local social entrepreneurship community and understood to be good examples of how to tackle social problems. We applied an inductive design based on qualitative techniques for the data collection and analysis (Gioia et al., 2013 ; Miles and Huberman, 1994 ). Two researchers conducted 15 interviews with the (co)founders or CEOs of the selected social entrepreneurial ventures (totaling 17 ​h and 48 ​min, and resulting in 356 pages of transcripts). Based on a step-by-step interpretative analysis, the data were first analyzed individually by two authors and, subsequently, their interpretations were discussed among all members of the research team. We made extensive use of coding matrixes to understand the rationales towards SDGs and their utilization by social entrepreneurs among the case ventures. Fig. 1   incorporates the results of the data coding and analysis.  4 Findings Our data reveal two major insights. First, the responses indicate a significant heterogeneity in the utilization of the SDG framework, revealing three distinct types which we label as SDG evangelism, SDG opportunism, and SDG denial. Second, the majority of social entrepreneurial ventures in our sample had reservations towards the specific content of the SDGs or the UN as the political organization behind the SDGs, which ultimately influenced how SDGs were utilized by each venture. Considering the optimistic assessment of the synergies between the SDG framework and the efforts of social entrepreneurs in the dominant perspective on societal grand challenges, this finding surprised the research team. Based on our findings, Table 2   outlines the three utilization types of the SDG framework, which we discuss in the following subsections. 4.1 SDG evangelism Five social entrepreneurial ventures utilized the SDGs proactively as an organizing and unifying framework. Three of these ventures utilized the SDGs in internal and external organizational activities, emphasizing that working towards the SDGs was an “affair of the heart” (Co-founder Case Juliet). They integrated the SDGs into the venture’s work processes , as the following quote illustrates:“I’m convinced that, in our global world, our problems are global in nature. The SDGs summarize them in a good and comprehensive way. Therefore, they are also part of our tandem process. In our newly designed process, we use the SDGs as a basis to match tandem partners, and the SDGs are also part of the learning curriculum. The task for us will be that the tandem partners implement their projects based on the SDGs–so the SDGs become the roadmap for the projects.” (Founder Case Foxtrot)   These ventures had developed tools and processes around the SDGs in order to place them at the forefront of their daily work, using them as an action-oriented framework that provided clarity and set priorities while offering a common language  by which to involve stakeholders. The founders of Delta used the SDGs to create a mutual understanding and to assess the impact they created together with partners, as they viewed the SDGs as an objective system of goals that all stakeholders could agree upon. Other social entrepreneurial ventures used the SDGs to signal  an “identification goal” (Co-founder Case Echo) and communicate  their social, environmental, and economic performance to high-status stakeholders such as government agencies, federal institutions, and corporate clients, aiming to partner with them in order to achieve their mission, as the following quote illustrates:“When we present our company, we always use the SDG 4 sign on the first slide. We can signal easily to others that this is what we work for. We cannot change the world on our own. That means that we need allies. (…) We use them [the SDGs] as an identification tool.” (Co-founder Case Echo)   In line with this, another social entrepreneur explained the use of SDGs as a “reference framework (…) in order to map and organize their community” (Co-founder Case Delta) and, by matching  potential partners, collaborate to work towards shared or similar SDGs across sectors or within the same sector.  4.2 SDG opportunism Other social entrepreneurial ventures applied an opportunistic approach as they identified instrumental value in utilizing the SDGs in their organizational practices. These ventures only used the SDGs as means to an end , for example, to mobilize resources from organizations that requested the use of the SDGs  in the funding application process, as this quote shows:“Yes, we know about [the SDGs] and consider how we can use them when we write applications [for government funds]. And yes, we use them to connect with others and lobby for our cause. (…) But honestly, I do not have the feeling that they play a central role. We use them when it is beneficial for us, but since only very few know about them, they are mostly irrelevant. (…) They are definitely of no value to our internal work.” (Co-founder Case Alpha)   In particular, social entrepreneurs who acquired funds from government agencies reported that the application of SDGs helped them legitimize their organizational goals and activities and thus were helpful in acquiring government support. Furthermore, these social entrepreneurial ventures would utilize the SDG framework to assess their performance  against the targets and indicators if funding bodies requested the assessment along the standardized SDG framework. While these ventures saw value in an opportunistic use of the SDGs, they did not apply them as goals themselves or integrate them in internal operations due to their purely symbolic meaning, questioning the non-binding character: “As soon as it gets difficult politicians throw ideals and goals overboard (…) and you get the bitter sweet taste that, in the end, they do not prioritize them [the SDGs] at all.” (Co-founder Case November)    4.3 SDG denial Our findings reveal a larger group of social entrepreneurial ventures that did not utilize the SDGs due to (i) pragmatic as well as (ii) idealistic reasons. Regarding the former, social entrepreneurial ventures perceived the SDGs as being impractical  because their operations were small-scale and had limited resources to implement the SDG framework. More specifically, the studied entrepreneurs saw a detachment between the micro-level of their ventures and the macro-level of the SDGs, as illustrated in the following quote:“The SDGs are too removed from our reality. We do not understand how to apply the SDGs and have no time or money to investigate them. We know we are making an impact here. Do the SDGs then matter?” (Co-founder Case India)   Due to the self-sustainable nature of some social entrepreneurial ventures and the related disuse of public funding, another interviewee reflected that they were not required to “find a common language with the external world” (Co-founder Case Bravo) and, therefore, saw no relevance  in applying the SDG framework to their operations. Some social entrepreneurial ventures rejected the SDGs for idealistic reasons and viewed the utilization of the framework very critically. While such social entrepreneurial ventures were aware of potential SDG benefits such as a “together-for-the-SDGs feeling” (Co-founder Case Bravo), they took a distancing stance on implementing top-down frameworks such as the SDGs provided by the UN which, as some social entrepreneurs add, pursue an imperialist agenda. Some social entrepreneurs believed that a grass-roots approach  is required to create impact locally and saw a misfit between the “superficial SDGs and (…) the social ventures’ step-by-step grass-roots approach” (Founder Case Hotel). Multiple social entrepreneurs in our study also mentioned a distrust in global organizations  such as the UN, which were viewed to may have changing political and nontransparent agendas, as the following quote illustrates:“I basically have a big distrust of huge organizations [like the UN]. I have witnessed too many times how they polish facts and figures and change scenarios. So most of the time the message is good, but everything remains equally bad in reality. Therefore, I do not have too much trust. And that the funding structures and the agendas follow the will of the Global North is hard for me to accept. And therefore, it is not a framework we would work with.” (Co-founder Case Golf)     5 Discussion We set out to investigate the research question of how social entrepreneurial ventures utilize the SDGs to create social value. Our findings outline a heterogenous view of how an arguably useful resource such as the SDG framework is alternatively used, revealing i) three different SDG (non)utilization types as well as showing ii) resourcefulness and deviance of the social entrepreneurial ventures’ actions in the presence of the vaguely formulated SDG framework. In this way, we contribute to research at the intersection of social entrepreneurship and global efforts to address societal grand challenges in three distinct ways. First , we contribute to the social entrepreneurship literature by exploring social entrepreneurial ventures’ utilization of the SDGs empirically. Scholarly discourse on the implications of the SDG framework for social entrepreneurial ventures is emerging. In this context, Littlewood and Holt (2018 : 44) call for future research that “might examine why some social entrepreneurial ventures are engaging with and communicating their commitment to the SDGs and why others are not.” Pomare (2018 : 24) adds “that future research needs to better reflect the factors that may stimulate SMEs’ sensitivity to SDGs.” We respond to these calls by studying SDG utilization types, detailing the rationales of social entrepreneurs’ underlying alternative usages and illustrating organizational practices that contextualize and operationalize the SDGs. By analyzing the utilization of the SDG framework by social entrepreneurial ventures, our study applies a bottom-up approach and provides insights into micro-level dynamics of materialization and operationalization of macro-level institutions. In revealing three distinct utilization types, we show that social entrepreneurial ventures do not fully commit and adjust to the SDG framework, although scholars, practitioners, and politicians alike view these ventures as a central contributor towards achieving the SDG. In particular, our findings indicate three distinct forms of utilization ranging from an adoption of the SDGs as an organizing and unifying framework (i.e., SDG Evangelism), utilization of the SDGs as a means to an end when externally required (i.e., SDG Opportunism), to complete rejection of the SDGs due to pragmatic or idealistic reasons (i.e., SDG Denial). In general, the SDG framework is supposed to act as a compass and powerful narrative for social entrepreneurial ventures, conducive to creating social value and taking action (SDG Compass, 2015 ). However, our study shows that the majority of the interviewed social entrepreneurs have strong reservations towards the SDGs. The opportunistic utilization or complete rejection of the SDGs might be a result of its development as a top-down, one-size-fits-all framework which requires contextualization and operationalization in local contexts. Although there are some localization efforts, for example, the SDG index in Germany (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2016 ), Finland (Prime Minister’s Office Publications, 2017 ), or Ecuador (Moncayo et al., 2013 ), these efforts seem to be insufficient for social entrepreneurial ventures, or social entrepreneurs may be unaware of them. As such, the insufficient localization or the lack thereof may inhibit a feeling of ownership or internalization of goals for local actors, thereby fostering a gap between macro-level SDGs and micro-level social entrepreneurial ventures. Building a better understanding of the conditions necessary for using the SDGs successfully and establishing ways to contextualize and operationalize the SDGs through localized efforts is severely needed and forms an important and promising research avenue. Second , we contribute to the management literature about societal grand challenges by revealing resourcefulness and deviance as central themes in the actions of social entrepreneurial ventures in creating social value with vaguely formulated frameworks such as the UNs’ SDGs (Clough et al., 2019 ; Grimes et al., 2018 ). Our findings show that SDG Opportunists use this framework as a means to an end with a resourceful utilization by getting more from less and identifying ways to mobilize, assemble, and deploy resources, while SDG deniers raise arguments against the framework and deviate from using it. In case of resourcefulness , our findings indicate an interdependency between government institutions and social entrepreneurial ventures. Indeed, the UN as well as government institutions rely on organizations, in our case social entrepreneurial ventures, that pursue the SDGs by creating social value (Hall et al., 2012 ). Government institutions may promote the SDGs as a requirement for resource mobilization and transaction, as indicated by SDG opportunism, where the SDGs become a means to mobilize resources. Although such a utilization may allow them to assemble and enact resources to create social value (cf. Baker and Nelson, 2005 ; Reuer and Koza, 2000 ), it does not exploit the full potential nor align with the original ambition of the SDG framework. Using the SDGs opportunistically indicates that social entrepreneurs lack understanding of or are indifferent to the SDGs as an organizing and unifying framework of 17 interdependent goals (cf. Castellas and Ormiston, 2018 ; Le Blanc, 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ). This finding indicates the limits of a top-down approach that assumes social entrepreneurial ventures to be a means to pursue the SDGs. Thus, government institutions need to explicitly address social entrepreneurs as a major contributor to achieving the SDGs. With regard to deviance , our findings indicate a discontinuity between government institutions and social entrepreneurial ventures in creating social value, as in case of the SDG deniers, which raise arguments against implementing the SDG framework due to pragmatic and idealist reasons, although many of their actions may contribute to tackling societal grand challenges. Previous work has shown that deviance in sustainability certification can stem from differences in entrepreneurs’ engagement in identity work, which allows to authenticate the distinctiveness of one’s identity-based values (Grimes et al., 2018 ). For deviance of the SDGs, we identify trust  to be a central determinant, as several social entrepreneurs reported a distrust towards global, political organizations such as the UN. Scholars have highlighted that many entrepreneurs derive their mission from a desire to engage with problems that relate to areas where they feel that government institutions and multinational corporations have failed (Austin and Seitanidi, 2012 ). Considering the UN as part of the same ‘conglomerate’ of institutions that privilege the status quo at the expense of endangered and marginalized groups, they reject the SDGs on account of the organization in which they originate. The lack of the SDG framework’s acceptance among the studied social entrepreneurs implies that government actors and organizations cannot take for granted that social entrepreneurs accept the SDGs as a shared and legitimate framework. Although the UN specifically intended to address “all countries” (ICSU, 2015 : 7), for some social entrepreneurs, the SDGs symbolize an on-going imperialist attempt to impose Western values on the rest of the world. Third , our findings provide practical value for social entrepreneurs and policy makers alike. For social entrepreneurs, our study shows multiple practices for working internally and externally with the SDG framework, using them, for example, to map organizational performance, match collaborators, or educate stakeholders. The ways in which the SDGs can be integrated into social entrepreneurial ventures’ practices also form an important and promising research avenue. Scholars can further support this process by examining social entrepreneurial ventures that have successfully integrated the SDGs and by studying how social entrepreneurs learn of, and engage with, the SDG framework. For politicians, our findings identify trust and practicality to be central determinants for the utilization of the SDGs. The deviance and opportunism of the majority of social entrepreneurial ventures chiefly results from distrust towards the UN and the lack of contextualization of the framework. Local, national, and international government bodies should not underestimate the need to justify, localize, and translate SDGs in collaboration with social entrepreneurs. Comments of our interviewees suggest that the UN and other government institutions should collaborate with local, legitimate partners that can explicitly address social entrepreneurs as a major contributor in achieving the SDGs, for instance, by providing guidelines. There may also be a need for other modes of mobilization that does not draw on the SDG framework, and actively challenge the hegemony of the SDGs within the general social impact agenda. In conclusion, our study presents an early empirical investigation of social entrepreneurial ventures’ bottom-up perspective on the SDGs. We are hopeful that our work inspires scholars to delve more deeply into societal grand challenges from the perspective of social entrepreneurial ventures.    References Austin and Seitanidi, 2012 J.
