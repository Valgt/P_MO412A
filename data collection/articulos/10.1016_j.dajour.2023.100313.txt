                  The growing demand for data-driven decision-making and the emergence of new business models has led to a rise in digital technologies. As a result, businesses have become more aware of the impact of their activities on the environment, including the production of digital technologies. Sustainability has become a significant concern for businesses worldwide, pushing them to explore ways to integrate sustainable practices into their operations and address this issue. Digitization has emerged as an essential tool, with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology leading the way. Organizations can improve decision-making and enhance operational efficiency with IoT, but aligning its implementation with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals is essential. Concepts like Industry 4.0 and Circular Economy principles have emerged to create sustainable business models, but their implementation faces various challenges. Businesses must adopt analytical methods and tools to support strategic planning. This study applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method to identify twelve key challenges businesses face in this IoT adoption. A survey was used for gathering expert opinion from industry specialists working in the field of IoT for conducting advanced analytical techniques like Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (F-ISM) and Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliqués à un Classement (MICMAC) to highlight the most critical challenges, including loss of value appropriation, Low incentive to change, Less adoption of sustainable practices and Lack of interoperability. While IoT holds great promise for supporting sustainable development, the result highlights the urgent need for stakeholder collaboration to overcome these challenges and unlock its full potential. The findings of this study benefit organizations heavily dependent on digital services like IoT by providing them with a comprehensive framework for effectively implementing IoT towards sustainable development.

Geographical disparity Since the influence of technology (such as IoT) on SDGs differs between developed and developing countries, taking a comparable approach does not guarantee similar outcomes. [13,23,24]   2. Complex design issues The difficulty of integrating multiple materials and the requirement to assure reusability make designing sustainable IoT devices challenging. [5,11,25]   3. Ambiguous regulations and policies The need for defined technological legislation and norms generates uncertainty for organizations and users, leading to hesitation in implementing IoT technology. [5,11,16,26–28]   4. Inconsistent progress tracking Organizations struggle to demonstrate progress towards being more sustainable due to a lack of consistency and homogeneity, which makes it difficult to compare how well they are doing. [28–33]   5. Environmental issues IoT devices use up limited resources and produce e-waste, which can harm the environment and human health. [11,34–36]   6. Lack of awareness about emerging technologies Organizations seeking to adopt IoT technology through I4.0 for sustainability face challenges because of a lack of research on how to effectively use it. [37–40]   7. Privacy & security concerns The uncontrolled movement of e-waste poses a risk to IoT device security and privacy, as it may contain sensitive information and the increasing use of third-party data sources also presents a challenge for organizations. [5,26,27,41]   8. Loss of value appropriation Value appropriation confirms that the creators or providers of digital assets are getting a fair share of the value they generate but concerns over digital labor exploitation and power concentration exist. [42,43]   9. Economical challenges The initial investment costs of adopting IoT through I4.0 and Circular Economy, including training human capital and maintenance costs, are significant economic challenges for organizations. [44–47]   10. The low incentive to change Employee reluctance due to fear of job loss and funding problems can make it difficult for organizations to adopt IoT devices. [5,15,48–50]   11. Less adoption of sustainable practices Many developing countries lack knowledge and understanding of the advantages IoT offers and how they relate to company interests and align with the UN sustainability goals. [15,51]   12. Lack of interoperability Interoperability is a major issue in IoT, especially in I4.0, because ensuring compatibility of new technology with existing systems is often complex. [16,52]      Table 2 Identification of challenges.     Code Challenges Self-description   C  1     Geographical disparity Implementing sustainability requires understanding the interdependencies between organizations, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and digital technologies. The impact of technology on SDGs varies between developed and developing countries, hence applying a similar approach does not ensure similar results. Additionally, SDGs are interconnected and depend on social-ecological relationships and human rights law too, making it challenging for organizations to adopt IoT technologies in a sustainable manner.  C  2     Complex design issues Designing sustainable IoT devices is challenging due to the complexity of combining various materials and the need to ensure their reusability. This requires a systemic design approach, which can be resource intensive. Keeping track of waste and recycled materials is also crucial for a closed-loop system.  C  3     Ambiguous regulations and policies The lack of clear regulations and policies surrounding technology creates uncertainty for businesses and users, leading to hesitation in adopting IoT technology. This includes challenges such as uncontrolled e-waste movement and inadequate legislation covering IoT production like metallurgical processes, energy recovery etc.  C  4     Inconsistent progress tracking Organizations need to demonstrate progress towards being more sustainable, but it is hard to track that progress. The current information in sustainability reporting (SR) of companies is lacking in both consistency and homogeneity, which can make it hard to compare and understand how well they are doing. This makes it difficult for organizations to use IoT technology in a sustainable way because they cannot track their progress effectively.  C  5     Environmental issues IoT devices use up limited resources and produce e-waste, which can harm the environment and human health. E-waste contains valuable metals and other resources, but most of it is not collected or processed properly, leading to resource depletion. Without proper management of resources, it is hard for sustainable organizations to implement IoT devices.  C  6     Lack of awareness about emerging technologies Organizations seeking to adopt IoT technology through I4.0 for sustainability face challenges because of a lack of research on how to effectively use it. Traditional production systems have environmental and social limitations, but I4.0 can address many of them. However, unawareness of the latest technologies, and business models available, is a challenge for implementing IoT technology sustainably.  C  7     Privacy & security concerns Ensuring the privacy and security of IoT devices is crucial to maintain users’ trust and encourage adoption. The uncontrolled movement of e-waste poses a risk to IoT device security and privacy, as it may contain sensitive information that can be exploited by malicious actors. The increasing use of third-party data sources also presents a challenge for organizations with no clear data ownership and responsibility, where data can go into the wrong hands.  C  8     Loss of value appropriation Value appropriation confirms that the creators or providers of digital assets are getting a fair share of the value they generate, while also providing benefits to users and consumers. But concerns over digital labor exploitation and the concentration of power in the hands of platform owners can overshadow the potential benefits. The use of data from IoT devices raises questions about how it should be used and who should be in charge of it, and the potential for biases or harm to certain groups needs to be carefully considered.  C  9     Economical challenges The initial investment costs of adopting I4.0, including training human capital and maintenance costs, are significant economic challenges for organizations. Additionally, complementing IoT implementation with Circular Economy adoption can lead to higher processing fees that negate economic benefits, making it difficult for organizations to afford. These economic challenges hinder the implementation of IoT devices for sustainability.  C  10     Low incentive to change Employee reluctance due to fear of job loss and funding problems can make it difficult for organizations to adopt IoT device businesses, which otherwise have numerous advantages, such as solving autonomous problems.  C  11     Less adoption of sustainable practices For the successful implementation of IoT in a sustainable manner, companies must have a clear understanding of the advantages IoT offers and how they relate to company interests and align with the UN sustainability goals. IoT devices can help with sharing data and enabling Circular Economy practices, but many developing countries lack knowledge and awareness of these practices.  C  12     Lack of interoperability Interoperability is a major issue in IoT, especially in I4.0, because different technologies need to be integrated. Ensuring the compatibility of new technology with existing systems and ways of working is an important factor in the adoption of IoT.     Table 3 Expert details.      Expert no.

The growing demand for data-driven decision-making and the emergence of new business models has led to a rise in digital technologies. As a result, businesses have become more aware of the impact of their activities on the environment, including the production of digital technologies. Sustainability has become a significant concern for businesses worldwide, pushing them to explore ways to integrate sustainable practices into their operations and address this issue. Digitization has emerged as an essential tool, with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology leading the way. Organizations can improve decision-making and enhance operational efficiency with IoT, but aligning its implementation with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals is essential. Concepts like Industry 4.0 and Circular Economy principles have emerged to create sustainable business models, but their implementation faces various challenges. Businesses must adopt analytical methods and tools to support strategic planning. This study applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method to identify twelve key challenges businesses face in this IoT adoption. A survey was used for gathering expert opinion from industry specialists working in the field of IoT for conducting advanced analytical techniques like Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (F-ISM) and Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliqués à un Classement (MICMAC) to highlight the most critical challenges, including loss of value appropriation, Low incentive to change, Less adoption of sustainable practices and Lack of interoperability. While IoT holds great promise for supporting sustainable development, the result highlights the urgent need for stakeholder collaboration to overcome these challenges and unlock its full potential. The findings of this study benefit organizations heavily dependent on digital services like IoT by providing them with a comprehensive framework for effectively implementing IoT towards sustainable development.

Its proper implication began during the Paris Agreement in 2015 when companies became increasingly aware of sustainability [2] . Regardless of different interpretations and perspectives by multiple philosophers, sustainability means intergenerational equity [1] . The planned usage of resources such that both short and long-term needs are taken into consideration, depleting the resources for neither generation [1] . The United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [3]  framework to monitor this progress globally. The SDG agenda consists of 17 objectives that are part of the broader 2030 Agenda. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic that hit the industries (2019–2021), work was drastically changed and a sudden surge in the use of digital goods and services was observed [3,4] . This accelerated digitalization helped speed up the development process but resulted in poor implementation of sustainability. The focus on gross domestic product (GDP) growth led to the irresponsible depletion of finite resources and inefficient resource usage [3] . Because of this organizations have been facing challenges in adopting practices that are both sustainable and economically friendly [5,6] . In response, new initiatives such as Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Circular Economy rose to popularity to address the issue by ensuring sustainable products and reducing the need for direct human involvement to create a safer working environment [7] . Circular Economy emphasizes the adoption of the 6 R’s (reduce, reuse, recycle, recovery, redesign, and remanufacturing), while I4.0 emphasizes the use of cyber–physical systems to create smart factories that can promote sustainable development for the future — through technologies like IoT, Artificial intelligence, etc [8] . The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of any organization’s operation and interaction with its surroundings. Its development has immensely helped in promoting sustainability by simplifying processes, improving customizability, and enhancing the quality of life. The rapid expansion of IoT technology is expected to grow from $5.5 trillion to $12.6 trillion in global value by the next decade, [9,10] , presenting both opportunities and challenges for organizations looking to adopt this technology in a sustainable manner. Organizations must possess the appropriate tools, technologies, and processes to manage the complex “big” data generated by IoT devices. Designing data governance practices and infrastructures for IoT is especially complicated, because of the complexity of materials in products and the difficulty of recycling these materials [11] . This presents a challenge for organizations to dematerialize and use fewer resources in the production of goods and services [12] . The lack of understanding surrounding this complexity in IoT production hinders the development of system designs and affects the establishment of governance laws that can help maximize material and energy recovery in a Circular Economy. Despite the potential benefits, the relationship between digital technology, like IoT and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) still needs more research [13] . It is crucial to understand the impact of technology on the SDGs, as different regions have distinct resources and goals that require diverse approaches towards achieving sustainability [13] . Therefore, we cannot apply the same goals (SDGs) and expectations to all countries with a uniform approach. Sustainability is a complex concept and tracking its progress can be challenging. It is crucial to ensure that IoT is developed and used in a responsible and sustainable way for the long-term success of the technology. To achieve this, industry, government, and society must work together to ensure a sustainable future for everyone. Integrating IoT with Circular Economy and I4.0 principles, can facilitate the development of business strategies that are sustainable and align with principles of ethical business conduct [6] . Earlier work on Circular Economy focused on harnessing technology to make it work better and more effectively [8] . Today, however, researchers also focus on how to get people to accept the Circular Economy and change their behavior [8] . This has led to the emergence of the concept of organizational sustainability, which involves not only environmental, social, and economic performance but also employee spirituality, or their sense of identity and morals [1] . Studies on organizational identity [2,14]  reveal that groups can also create identities that shape individual behaviors and norms, by how they see themselves as an organization. This means personal development can be influenced by the organizational structure of a business and the practices through which it accomplishes its vision. By enforcing practices on their employees, companies can create a culture of sustainability that has increased awareness and understanding of the environment. Implementation of IoT also faces several design issues leading to technical and economic challenges. Economic challenges include system initialization costs, like hardware purchases, and the system operating cost with the cost of labor to manage IoT devices. The gap between service providers and service users has slowed the deployment of IoT applications. On the technical side, interference from a large number of IoT devices can degrade system performance and reduce the reliability of IoT systems. Other major challenges include low incentive to change due to job displacement [15] , and enabling seamless interoperability between devices and developing industry standards [16] . With reference to the statement “Systemic and interconnected problems need systemic and inter-connected solutions” [17] , sustainability through IoT implementation has interconnected challenges that need an “ideas first approach” [18] . This approach involves stakeholders of all levels in the idea generation and prioritization process; organizations can then ensure that the most pressing sustainability challenges are being addressed. In this regard, I4.0 technology, such as IoT, can play a vital role in promoting sustainability by staying connected to the wider ecosystem and providing important information about products throughout their life cycle [19] . This study highlights the need for IoT integration to enable the capabilities of reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling which are inherent to the Circular Economy. Addressing these issues is essential for realizing the full potential of IoT and its impact on sustainable development. This study aims to recognize the challenges hindering the adoption of IoT in a sustainable manner, to understand the interrelation of these challenges, and help businesses navigate these challenges effectively, resulting in sustainability. Through this study, we explore and aim to address the following research questions: RQ1: “What” are the challenges hindering the implementation of IoT towards sustainability? RQ2: “Why” and “How” are these challenges hindering the implementation of IoT towards sustainability? RQ3: What are the implications, propositions, and future directions of implementing IoT towards sustainability? In this regard, the authors identify the challenges that are hindering the implementation of IoT technology towards sustainability, through a comprehensive and systematic review process. In this study, we incorporate the PRISMA method [20,21] , which involves analysis by identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion section for all the papers identified. The review process will involve a comprehensive literature review to identify the challenges that are hindering the implementation of IoT towards sustainability (to answer RQ1). Once the challenges were identified, the authors employed the F-ISM and MICMAC analysis to derive the driving-dependence relationship between these challenges. This analysis will help us understand how different problems are connected to each other and influence each other using IoT technology. By doing so, we can identify where we can make improvements and decide how to create and use IoT technology in a way that is sustainable over time. (To answer RQ2). Additionally, this study will contribute to the ongoing effort in improving the understanding of IoT and sustainability and will lay down the foundations for future work in this area (To answer RQ3). By providing a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and their interrelationships, organizations will be better equipped to manage challenges and achieve sustainability. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2  undertakes an extensive discussion of the wide-ranging challenges associated with the sustainable implementation of IoT in organizations. Section 3  offers a detailed account of the research design adopted for this study, outlining a systematic, step-by-step approach to the analysis. In Section 4 , the study presents an in-depth analysis of the results obtained from the F-ISM and MICMAC analyses. This section also highlights the interconnection between challenges and offers insights into how the model can be more effective. Section 5  sets forth the study’s propositions and implications. Lastly, Section 6  concludes the study’s observations, explores its limitations, and gives further direction for future research.  2 Literature review The authors employed PRISMA approach to discover relevant publications [21] . The first of four critical stages in this approach (illustrated in Fig. 1 ) is identification [22] . For preliminary identification, the authors used the Scopus database and discovered 1,379 publications using the Title-Abstract-Key search method, which contained phrases like Title-ABS-Key (‘Sustainability’ OR ‘Sustainable’, OR ‘Inhibitor’, OR ‘Barrier’, OR ‘Challenge’ OR ‘Technology’, OR ‘Hinders’, OR ‘Industry 4.0’ OR ‘Constraint’ OR ‘Circular’ OR ‘Economy’ OR ‘Organization’ OR ‘Disadvantage’ OR ‘IoT’ OR ‘Internet’ OR ‘Of’ OR ‘Things’). The second step was screening, utilizing criteria for inclusion and exclusion such as limiting the selection to articles published between 2017 and 2023 in the subject areas of business, management, and accounting, with a document type of ’article,’ source type of ’journal,’ and language of ‘English’. This resulted in the elimination of 1,300 articles from further consideration. So, out of the 1,379 documents, 79 articles were left which met the inclusion requirements and were subjected to further review. In the third phase, eligibility included reviewing the article titles and abstracts, which was preceded by a full-text analysis to determine the publications’ status. During a brainstorming session with the authors, 44 studies were eliminated. These studies were found to have no bearing on the context of the study and did not contribute to the research questions or did not align with inclusion criteria despite their relevance to digitalization and SDGs. The inclusion criteria involved focused implementation of IoT or SDGs through digital models. The research was finally limited to 35 papers highlighting IoT problems that organizations may face for sustainable development. The next sections of this paper go into further depth on the study’s methodology and results.  After a thorough literature review, 12 challenges were identified that can make implementation of IoT in a sustainable manner difficult. These challenges are presented in Table 1 .   2.1 Geographical disparity Understanding the interdependencies between organizations, the SDGs, and digital technologies is the first crucial step for sustainably implementing IoT technology within organizations [4] . Digital technologies impact SDGs differently in ‘developed’ and ‘developing’ countries [4,13] . In developed countries, things like education, technology, and global connections help improve health and sustainability (SDG 3) and partnerships for development (SDG 17) through the use of digital tools [13] . In developing countries, things like education and economic freedom, also improved by technology, help with peaceful societies (SDG 16). By using digital tools and having good infrastructure in developed countries, things like healthcare and partnerships can be managed more efficiently, which is really important for these sustainability goals. Telesford [53]  propose that the SDGs are indivisible or closely interrelated through socio-ecological relationships that are critical for attaining just sustainability. Moreover, the SDGs are interrelated with other areas of international law, including human rights law [23,24] . It is hence crucial to acknowledge that a uniform approach cannot be applied to all countries as each country has unique goals and expectations, making it difficult for organizations to adopt IoT technologies for sustainable development.  2.2 Complex design issues Design plays a crucial role in the Circular Economy and in turn sustainability. Good design can help products last longer and retain their value, and the right business model can help make the Circular Economy work. Designing IoT devices is a challenging task that requires various resources, such as metals and chemicals [11] . Even though every material serves a specific purpose [11] , their combination together in a module is difficult and requires complex model designs. I4.0 has further included factors like economic, environmental, and social issues, making the design process more complex [5] . Implementation of effective approaches like the Systemic Design (SD) too, however, requires multiple experts with different skills and knowledge working alongside the designers [25] , which results in funding and resource (manpower) issues. Additionally, organizations need to ensure that the design of IoT devices is made in such a way that their parts and materials are reusable to reduce waste and save energy. Keeping track of all waste and recycled materials is also important to ensure a closed-loop system in a Circular Economy. The designing issues and complexities, therefore, make the implementation of IoT devices difficult in a sustainable manner within organizations.  2.3 Ambiguous regulations and policies The regulatory and policy framework surrounding technology is still nascent. The lack of clear regulations and policies creates uncertainty for businesses and users, leading to hesitation in adopting technologies like IoT. As of 2022, approximately 71% of the global population is bound by regulations based on e-waste, which vary depending on the region [34] . However, the remaining 29% of the population is yet to adopt a legal framework to ensure sustainable management of e-waste [34] . Despite the existence of e-waste legislation in some countries, illegal practices and imports of e-waste continue to exist. The uncontrolled movement of e-waste, which accounts for more than half of the total transboundary movement [41,54] , often involves illegal activities and poses a risk to the security and privacy of IoT devices and the depletion of resources needed for its production. This issue affects over 40% of the world’s population [26,34]  and is another cause of environmental impact. This also highlights the problem of exported products, which should be regulated and recovered by well-designed/legislated systems to create a strategic reuse plan for elements, metals and, compounds [11,54] . Waste management system, for example, stands on three factors of sustainability — environmental, social, and economic [5] . However, creating policies that combine all the criteria can be challenging, and shows a significant research gap [27,28] . The need for skilled professionals and advanced tools for the implementation of such laws also hinders the successful implementation of policies [29] . The success of sustainability policies is further complicated by the differing priorities and approaches of organizations in their implementation [16] . Additionally, existing legislation does not address metallurgical, energy recovery, and recycling infrastructure, which is used in IoT production and necessary for its transition from Linear to Circular Economy [5] . Therefore, improper data governance framework hinders the sustainable implementation of IoT technology in organizations.  2.4 Inconsistent progress tracking While setting sustainable goals and policies is a crucial first step, tracking their progress is a different challenge altogether. As organizations strive to adopt sustainable practices, the need for demonstrating their progress becomes more significant. However, the current information in sustainability reporting (SR) of companies is lacking in both consistency and homogeneity, with high differences observed in the weight and indicators given to each of the three factors of sustainability — environment, social, and economic [30,31] . In particular, the social dimension remains the least developed, with many tools capable of measuring sustainability performance only considering social performance in a limited manner [29] . Furthermore, inconsistencies in the communication of sustainability information further complicate matters, with varying content, format, and indicators used across different SRs. While some progress has been made in identifying communication patterns and information gaps [32] , more efforts are needed to improve the consistency and comparability of SRs [28,33] . By providing a clear set of sustainability indicators, SRs can have a positive impact on both social and business levels, improving company reputation and highlighting their commitment to sustainability. Without these indicators, it becomes difficult for organizations to track their progress and in return unable to implement IoT technology efficiently and in a sustainable manner.  2.5 Environmental issues The production of IoT devices also involves limited resources, such as metals and chemicals [11] , especially different kinds of pollutants [35] , and contributes to the growing concern about e-waste, which has a low recycling rate of 20% [9] . The transboundary movement of e-waste also poses challenges for sustainable organizations as it makes it difficult to track the flow of materials, leading to improper disposal, increased environmental damage, and health risks [34] . This lack of proper disposal also contributes to the depletion of valuable resources that are required to manufacture new IoT devices [36] . Amongst the e-waste generated, a small portion of 17.4% (9.3 Mt) is collected and reported, leaving a significant majority of 82.6% (44.3 Mt) unaccounted for, leading to varying environmental and human health impacts around the world [34] . The e-waste consists of a diverse range of natural and manufactured materials, including precious and platinum group metals, base metals, plastics, and other non-metallic substances [34] . These materials have a combined value of approximately USD 65 billion, equivalent to the GDP of many countries [34] . However, instead of preserving the raw materials, these valuable resources are often incinerated. Retaining these elements requires nurturing and development of the recycling and metallurgical industry. Failure to address the environmental impact of e-waste makes the implementation of IoT devices challenging for sustainable organizations.  2.6 Lack of awareness about emerging technologies Organizations using IoT services need to consider I4.0 technology’s aid in reaching sustainability. However, there is a significant research gap in the literature on how organizations can effectively use I4.0 to promote sustainability [55] . Traditional production systems suffer from resource depletion, environmental degradation, and pollution [37] . According to Morrar et al. [38] , the fourth industrial revolution has the potential to overcome the ecological and societal limitations of traditional industrial practices and technologies, paving the way for a more sustainable future. According to Ferasso et al. [39]  however, organizations frequently lack awareness of government policies concerning emerging technologies and sustainable business models, placing them at risk of failure [40] . This lack of awareness is therefore a challenge for sustainable implementation of IoT technology in organizations.  2.7 Privacy & security concerns IoT devices can collect and transmit sensitive data, and without adequate security measures, this data could be compromised, leading to privacy violations or cyberattacks [26] . The uncontrolled movement of e-waste, which accounts for more than half of the total transboundary movement, often involves illegal activities, and poses a risk to the security and privacy of IoT devices [36,41] . This is because e-waste may contain sensitive information that can be exploited by malicious actors for criminal activities like identity theft or financial fraud. Ensuring the privacy and security of IoT devices is crucial to maintain the trust of users and encourage their adoption. With the increasing use of third-party data sources, determining data ownership and responsibility can become a challenge [5] . Organizations need to establish clear ownership and responsibility for their data and ensure that third-party data sources are used ethically and responsibly. Therefore, no proper structure within an organization can make the implementation of IoT devices difficult for sustainable organizations.  2.8 Loss of value appropriation Value appropriation confirms that the creators or providers of digital assets are getting a fair share of the value they generate, while also providing benefits to users and consumers. Organizations should not focus only on profit but should also ensure the long-term growth of their implementation. IoT devices involve the connection of physical devices to the internet, allowing them to collect and exchange data [56] . This can provide valuable insights into organizational operations, leading to increased efficiency and sustainability. However, the concerns regarding the exploitation of digital labor and the concentration of power in the hands of platform owners overshadow the potential benefits of IoT implementation. For example, data from contact tracing apps helped during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic [57] . Data from smart devices can also help older people live at home more easily [42] . However, using data also raises questions about how it should be used and who should be in charge of it. Data is not neutral and can reflect biases [43,58]  or be used in ways that harm certain groups of people. These are big questions about how we should use data, and they need to be thought about carefully [43] . Therefore, loss of value appropriation can make the implementation of IoT devices unethical for sustainable organizations.  2.9 Economical challenges Economic challenges pose a significant hurdle for organizations adopting I4.0. While its advanced technologies lower manufacturing costs and increase profitability, there are significant initial investment costs. At present, it is only human capital that possesses the ability to execute complex and personalized production tasks [44] . However, implementing I4.0 is not limited to maintenance costs but also needs to train the workforce to appropriately implement and operate automated systems to guarantee their continuous operation. I4.0 also demands a relatively extensive time frame and requires more effort from the industry. For instance, the amount of capital available to a company at the outset may impact the extent of its research and development (R&D) activities, ultimately shaping the composition of its product [45] . Implementation of IoT when further complemented by the adoption of Circular Economy forces companies to create supply chains that improve environmental sustainability [46,47] . This transformation towards CE involves improving technology not just linearly but the system as a whole, improving the product handling process [46] . But adopting CE can be economically challenging and in some cases may even worsen the product profit [46]  and only a few developed companies are able to afford it [46] . Hence, economic challenges make the implementation of IoT devices difficult for sustainable organizations.  2.10 Low incentive to change Companies operating in the manufacturing sector tend to react less towards evolving customer needs and demands [48,59] . Companies today have a hard time keeping up with the changing needs of customers because products are becoming more complex and customized [49] . It is also challenging to reduce time to market, use resources effectively, minimize waste, and recycle materials. Manufacturing organizations in developed countries can gain a competitive advantage by utilizing sustainable technologies [5,50] . However, employees may be hesitant to adopt new technologies due to fear of loss of jobs: manual tasks may be eliminated due to automation [15] . Funding problems can also make it hard to change towards sustainability. Therefore, employee reluctance is a significant challenge that can make the adoption of IoT devices difficult for sustainable organizations.  2.11 Less adoption of sustainable practices Understanding the alignment between organizational objectives and the United Nations’ sustainable expectations is critical to the successful adoption of I4.0 and Circular Economy principles [60] . IoT constantly updates device information, and these digital transformations become fundamental elements that influence management decisions, such as data sharing, end-of-life product information, and the materials used in product development, both among customers and across production units. This improved cooperation between production and management makes Circular Economy practices possible. For example, consumers are often not aware of the impacts of plastic pollution and raising awareness among consumers through campaigns or workshops can empower them to make sustainable choices and reduce plastic usage [51] . However, in many developing countries, research between institutional change and sustainable practices is still nascent. Many organizations also lack the ability to take the initiative for upgrading technological processes which would make them sustainable and more competitive [15] . This is due to a lack of awareness surrounding the potential of I4.0 technologies and the Circular Economy. Therefore, the need for skill enhancement and awareness of how IoT can be implemented in a sustainable manner is a major challenge of IoT adoption.  2.12 Lack of interoperability Interoperability is a major challenge in IoT implementation, which involves the integration of different data sources [52] . One of the technical issues in I4.0 technologies such as IoT is the poor interoperability of different technologies, which requires complex data integration. Semantic interoperability is essential to integrate heterogeneous data from various sources and ensure that the meaning of the data is understood by different computer systems or applications [16] . This helps in avoiding misinformation, misleads, and errors that could increase project costs and development time. By enabling better monitoring and management of resources across different devices and systems, interoperability can lead to better resource utilization [16] . However, ensuring the compatibility of new technology with existing systems and ways of working is an important factor in the adoption of I4.0. The study by Adamczyk et al. [16]  highlighted the lack of attention given to compatibility in IoT applications in I4.0. This can make it challenging for companies to adopt IoT for sustainable development.   3 Methodology Decision-making is complex and ambiguous, given the identification of challenges, therefore depending simply on quantitative metrics can be difficult. Non-quantitative or qualitative metrics, for instance, can assist decision-makers to deal with the complexities and uncertainty inherent and help make more robust and resilient decisions that can withstand unexpected changes or disruptions in the system. The authors use fuzzy logic to describe this imprecision, with values represented by linguistic preferences such as “very weak”, “weak”, “moderate”, “strong”, or “very strong”. To integrate the identified challenges, the authors discovered that Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) outperforms other interpretative techniques such as Analytic Network Process (ANP), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) etc [61] . F-ISM, which blends fuzzy logic and ISM, is particularly appropriate in this study since IoT adoption for sustainable development encompasses numerous interconnected and difficult challenges. F-ISM can engage with experts for feedback and assessments to generate associated connections among variables, effectively addressing this complexity. F-ISM can increase the accuracy and dependability of the results by further providing linguistic phases for evaluating both ISM and MICMAC analysis at the same time, thereby allowing for a fuller study of the issues involved. In the past, the methodology has been utilized to assess the relationship between various challenges of Big Data, Industry 4.0, and Supply Chain. [62–64] . However, research on F-ISM and its applications is still in its nascent stages. The goal of this research is to explore the field further and close the gap. This methodology of the work has been illustrated in Fig. 2 .  Step 1: Identification of challenges using PRISMA methodology  The authors of this study have conducted a thorough literature survey to identify several challenges that can make the implementation of IoT in a sustainable manner difficult. These challenges are presented in Table 2 .  Step 2: Expert opinion using fuzzy logic  To deal with uncertainty we are considering soft measures in terms of linguistic phrases. We employ expert judgments (for details of the experts see Table 3 ) and assign a range of values to each linguistic phrase instead of a precise mathematical value. We do this to avoid quantifying vagueness using fuzzy number (A), with weight between 0 and 1.   Banerjee and Roy [65]  proposed a trapezoidal membership function, which is characterized by four parameters, namely a, b, c, and d. It has a trapezoidal shape and can be used to represent uncertain or imprecise information in a fuzzy logic system. Here, the function, was applied to determine the degree of membership, represented as μ  A     of the element A in the fuzzy set, with the definition (m  1    , m  2    , m  3    , m  4    ), where m  1     to m  4     are real values that define the shape of the trapezoidal function and k is the threshold, to represent this: (1) μ  A   = 0 , k ≤ 1   k − m  1    m  2   − m  1     , m  1   ≤ k ≤ m  2     1 , m  2   ≤ k ≤ m  3     m  4   − k  m  4   − m  3     , m  3   ≤ k ≤ m  4     0 , k ≥ m  4            Table 4  lists the phrases ‘very less effective,’ ‘less effective,’ ‘moderately less effective,’ ‘moderately high effective,’ ‘higher effective,’ and ‘very higher effective’, and indicates the different levels of influence. For example, during buying a house, its location has ‘very high effect’ on a buyer, while direction of house may have ‘moderately medium effect’, this contributes to the final decision-making criteria. Similarly, the challenges can be driven/influenced more by one driver than the other. The row in the matrix shown in Table 5  represents the driving power  between the elements. Driving variables (drivers) are the challenges that have a direct influence on other existing challenges in the system, that is the ability of a variable to exert an influence on other variables in the system. While the column represents the dependence power  which is variables that are impacted by other variables in the system.  Step 3: De-fuzzification through centroid equation  It is not possible to directly compare fuzzy numbers in order to make evaluations. As a result, a method is used to calculate exact values that may be used for comparison. This procedure is de-fuzzification, and it can be achieved in a variety of methods. One of the most often utilized methods for de-fuzzification is determining the centroid [66] . To convert this fuzzy value matrix into a crisp value that can be used for decision-making, the authors apply the centroid equation, C  A    . They use Eq. (2)  to calculate the centroid for each category based on its degree of membership (μ  A   )   : (2) C  A   = b  3  2   + b  4  2   + b  3   b  4   − b  1  2   − b  2  2   − b  2   b  3    3 ( b  3   + b  4   − b  1   − b  2   )        Here, b  1    , b  2    , b  3     and b  4     are the sides of the trapezium as discussed in Eq. (1) . We obtain the de-fuzzified matrix shown in Table 6  by applying Eq. (2)  in Fuzzy value matrix.   Step 4: Initial reachability matrix  Applying Eq. (3)  to the values in de-fuzzified matrix we obtain the initial reachability matrix as illustrated in Table 7 : (3) C  A   = 0 ,  C ≤ 0 . 35   1 ,  C > 0 . 35           Step 5: Final reachability matrix  The final reachability matrix depicts how components in a system are interconnected and how each component affects others directly or indirectly. According to the ISM’s transitivity law, if element A has an effect on B and B has an effect on element C, then A must also have an effect on C. To apply this in Table 7  we replace 0 (absence of relationship) with 1 (presence of relationship) for A effects C. This matrix illustrates the logical relationships between the different components and can aid in identifying the most significant ones in the system. The application of this transitivity law to the values of the initial reachability matrix is demonstrated in Table 7 , which produces the modified final reachability matrix as displayed in Table 8 .   Step 6: Level partitioning  The final reachability matrix is divided into tiers to identify each driver’s (driving power) level. This level indicates how much influence a challenge has on other challenges in the system. The reachability and antecedence is derived from the final reachability matrix [67] . The reachability set of (say) a challenge C1 will be the set of all the challenges being affected by challenge C1, while antecedence set will be set of all challenges that effect challenge C1. The intersection set denotes the set of elements that share common membership with both the reachability set and antecedence set. The comparison between the reachability set and intersection set is then done to determine the level of each element in the ISM hierarchy. The level 1 driver is then taken out to repeat the iteration for level 2 and so on till all the challenge is assigned some level. In this case, we repeated 6 iterations to get level partitioning table (Table 9 ).  Step 7: Implementing digraph  After finding out the challenges and their degree of influence, we can now use the level partitioning table to build a hierarchal structure through a set of directed graphs consisting of nodes and arrows [68,69] . Among the 12 challenges in the implementation of IoT for sustainable development, environmental impact, Inconsistent progress tracking and unclear regulations and policies are on the highest level in hierarchy while Loss of value appropriation is the lowest on the structure, with rest of the 8 challenges lie between them. Their implementation is shown in Fig. 3 , and F-ISM model illustrated in Fig. 4 . Step 8: Removing redundancy by implementing reduced conical matrix  By arranging the values of the final reachability matrix (Table 8 ) according to their driving power in increasing order, we can generate a reduced conical matrix (Table 10 ) that presents the challenges in a prioritized format. This arrangement allows us to identify relationships in the form of paths between challenges, and to show their correlations without any overlapping paths, as shown in Fig. 4 . This approach enables a clearer understanding of the interrelatedness of the challenges and their impact on the overall system.   Step 9: MICMAC Analysis  The acronym “MICMAC” is for “Matrice d’Impacts Croisés -Multiplication Appliquée à un Classement ”, which roughly translates to “Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification”. Building a matrix to depict the connections between the elements in a system is MICMAC analysis’s first step. Values are entered into the matrix to indicate the direction and intensity of each relationship between each pair of elements. It is a driver-dependence matrix that divides the challenges into clusters, each with a common set of functionalities. These clusters are as follows: Autonomous challenges (I)  — These challenges have a high driving power and a low dependence. They strongly influence other challenges, while are not easily influenced by other challenges. These challenges are critical for the development of the system as they drive majority of the system. In this study, the identified challenges are Complex design issues (C2), Inconsistent progress tracking(C4), Environmental issues (C5), Privacy & security concerns (C7) and Economical challenges (C9). Dependent challenges (II)  — These challenges have low driving power but high dependence. These challenges are non-critical to the system as they do not drive the project but are rather driven by others. In this study, the identified challenges are Geographical disparity (C1), Ambiguous regulations and policies (C3) and Lack of awareness about emerging technologies (C6). Linkage challenges (III)  — These challenges have high driving power but low dependence. These challenges are critical in a system as they strongly influence other challenges and are strongly interconnected. There are no linkage challenges in our study. Driving challenges (IV)  — These challenges have both low driving and dependence. They do not​ easily influence other challenges while at the same time are not influenced by other challenges. These challenges are not critical to the system as they do not bring enough change to the system. In this study, the identified challenges are Loss of value appropriation (C8), Low incentive to change (C10), Less adoption of sustainable practices (C11) and Lack of interoperability (C12). Understanding the different types of challenges in a system can help in developing strategies for addressing them. For instance, given their larger influence on the system’s overall performance, autonomous challenges may need more care and resources than dependent ones. Linkage challenges may require collaborative efforts between different stakeholders or departments to address their interrelated nature. Addressing the underlying causes of dependant challenges that are causing them to be influenced by other challenges may be necessary. Driving problems might not be as urgent, but they should still be dealt with to keep the system stable and healthy in general.    4 Results and discussion In this study, there are 12 identified challenges in implementing IoT for sustainable development. The authors have employed F-ISM methodology which divides the challenges in 6 levels (as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 ). According to level partitioning, the levels signify the degree of integration between the different parts of the application. The different levels are often named after their position in the IoT development lifecycle for sustainability. The study identified Loss of value appropriation (C8) at level 6, Less adoption of sustainable practices (C11) and Lack of interoperability (C12) at level 5, Privacy & security concerns (C7) and Low incentive to change (C10) at level 4, Geographical disparity (C1) and Complex design issues (C2) at level 3, Lack of awareness about emerging technologies (C6) and Economical challenges (C9) at level 2, Ambiguous regulations and policies (C3), Inconsistent progress tracking (C4) and Environmental issues (C5) at level 1. This analysis shows the criticality of any project can be resolved if the interrelation of the challenges at level 4, 5 and 6 are understood and implemented well. Loss of value appropriation, Less adoption of sustainable practices, Lack of interoperability, Privacy & security concerns and Low incentive to change should be prioritized by the companies for implementation of sustainability solutions. Followed by level partitioning, MICMAC analysis was conducted for a more comprehensive view. This analysis shows their driving-dependence ratio and helps in understanding the influence of one challenge over the other. The challenges are expressed in terms of clusters — autonomous challenges, dependent challenges, linkage challenges and driving challenges (as shown in Fig. 5 ). The first cluster includes challenges that do not easily influence other challenges and are not critical to the system. The challenges identified in this cluster are Complex design issues (C2), Inconsistent progress tracking (C4), Environmental issues (C5), Privacy & security concerns (C7) and Economical challenges (C9). For example, if the organization encounters financial difficulties when implementing its IoT system, it may struggle to fund the project or attain financial sustainability. However, this challenge has no substantial impact from other system challenges such as geographical disparity which will be affected by local infrastructure and laws of a place. The second cluster includes challenges that are driven by others, identified challenges in this cluster are Geographical disparity (C1), Ambiguous regulations and policies (C3) and Lack of awareness about emerging technologies (C6). The third cluster is not present in the study, and the fourth cluster includes challenges critical to the system that strongly influence other challenges but are not easily influenced themselves, these challenges include Loss of value appropriation (C8), Low incentive to change (C10), Less adoption of sustainable practices (C11) and Lack of interoperability (C12). Understanding the challenges in their respective clusters can help organizations prioritize and tackle them effectively. Employee adoption of sustainable practices, for example, is a critical challenge in adopting an IoT waste management system. Low adoption rates may lead to false data collecting and inefficient waste disposal process. Furthermore, it may result in a lack of incentive to change and resistance to implementing IoT-based waste management [36] . Driving challenges, hence, require significant attention, dependent challenges can be addressed by external factors, and autonomous challenges may not require immediate action but should still be monitored. The purpose of this study was to recognize, explore and address the effect of challenges hindering the implementation of the IoT towards sustainability. The study successfully identifies and analyzes the challenges hindering the implementation of IoT towards sustainability through the use of the F-ISM and MICMAC analysis. The analysis enables the study to group the challenges into four clusters based on their driving-dependence ratio. This categorization helps to better understand the challenges and their impact on the system. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the interdependencies between the challenges, which provides insight into how addressing one challenge can have an impact on others. In this study, the observations are as follows: (i) The study identifies four crucial challenges that are particularly important for implementing IoT towards sustainability in businesses. These challenges are ’Loss of value appropriation’, ’Low incentive to change’, ’Less adoption of sustainable practices’, and ’Lack of interoperability’. The authors discuss how these challenges are interrelated and how addressing one challenge can have an impact on others. (ii) The challenges with the least amount of monitoring required are ‘Complex design issues’, ‘Inconsistent progress tracking’, ‘Environmental issues’, and ‘Economical challenges’. These challenges are autonomous in nature as identified in the MICMAC analysis because they have a lower driving-dependence ratio and are less critical to the overall performance of the system.  5 Research propositions and implications The observations from F-ISM and MICMAC analysis assist in formulating propositions for organizations to adopt IoT in a sustainable manner. The result helped to understand the interrelationship of the challenges better and is summarized in this section. In the study, the identified four crucial challenges are Loss of value appropriation (C8), Low incentive to change (C10), Less adoption of sustainable practices (C11) and Lack of interoperability (C12) on level 4, 5 and 6 through F-ISM methodology, as shown in Fig. 2 . Furthermore, Fig. 5  of MICMAC analysis also identified these challenges as driving challenges with strong influencing power. Therefore, these 4 challenges can be used to frame the following propositions for organizations to implement IoT in a sustainability aware context: Proposition 1 Fair value appropriation of organizations promote adoption of sustainable practices and positively affects its progress tracking.  Organizations that prioritize long term growth of their model implementation using IoT, without focusing on just profit are more likely to adopt sustainable practices  [9] . This approach not only benefits the environment but also contributes to the overall success of the organization by promoting a culture of responsible business practices. As organizations increasingly adopt sustainable IoT implementation, it is important to track and measure their progress towards achieving their sustainability goals. By tracking progress towards these goals, organizations can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability to stakeholders, including investors, customers, and employees  [28] .    Proposition 2 Effective adoption of sustainable practices impacts the mindset and encourages the employees to learn about the implementation of IoT in a geographically diverse environment. Adding latest technology and consistent communication of unambiguous regulations, positively impacts sustainable development.  Initiatives for upgrading technological processes by making them sustainable is crucial to remain competitive in a rapidly changing market  [15] . To achieve this, companies need to have a clear understanding of their own sustainability interests  [60] and how they relate to the implementation of IoT in a geographically diverse environment  [13] . By creating a culture of sustainability through the enforcement of sustainable practices, businesses can foster increased awareness and understanding of the environment among their employees  [2] . This, in turn, can help to promote the adoption of new technologies and the development of innovative solutions to sustainability challenges. To successfully implement sustainable practices, organizations must prioritize communication of policies and regulations  [16] . Providing clear expectations to employees can assist in comprehension of their roles and responsibilities, as well as enable them to actively contribute towards the company’s overall achievements. Additionally, the latest technologies, such as IoT, can be leveraged to promote sustainability and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of business operations.    Proposition 3 Achieving the IoT integration in sustainable manner positively reinforces employees’ view on its implementation, leading to a reduction in the overall project complexity and cost.  Better compatibility of technology helps in avoiding misinformation, misleads, and errors that could increase project costs and development time [70] . In this context, by promoting a positive attitude towards IoT, companies can reduce resistance to change and encourage the adoption of sustainable practices.    Proposition 4 Encouraging the adoption of sustainable practices in IoT implementation has a positive impact on the environment.  Clear communication of the benefits of sustainable practices and effective training and support can encourage employees to actively engage in the implementation of IoT towards achieving environmental goals  [50] . Sustainable practices in IoT implementation are crucial for organizations to make a positive impact on the environment while also realizing the benefits of IoT technology. For example, Apple reduced its carbon emission by promoting and manufacturing products through low emission product like aluminium instead of other materials  [71–73] .    Proposition 5 Improving security in a geographically diverse environment can have a positive impact on employees’ awareness of emerging technologies and the promotion of clear and consistent regulations.  By addressing security risks, organizations can create a safer and more secure environment, which can lead to increased employee confidence in using and adopting new technologies  [5] . However, digital technologies, like IoT, impact sustainability differently in developed and developing countries, and organizations need to understand the approach required for their respective geography and available resources  [5,13] . This understanding can help organizations comply with regulatory requirements and promote a culture of security and compliance. Moreover, the SDGs are interrelated with other areas of international law, including human rights law  [23,74,75] , and having a clear communication of regulations and policies required will benefit both the company and the environment. Overall, the emphasis on the importance of security, compliance, and sustainability in a geographically diverse environment improves employee awareness and promotes emerging technologies.    5.1 Implications Creating a sustainable tomorrow is essential for our well-being future. To improve it further we encourage employing sustainable implementation of IoT. In this study we follow Hamel’s [70]  method of exploring the 3WH method which answers the Why, What and Who (3 W) and the How (H) of our approach. The Why  of the study was — identification and analysis of the challenges, so that businesses in the future could benefit from them and incorporate the interdependencies in their future strategies. The What  of the study questions what needs to be done. As summarized in the result and discussion section, the realization of critical challenges that needs priority attention from organizations incorporating IoT in sustainable manner answers the need. The Who  of the study are the organizations heavily dependent on digital services like IoT who  benefit from this study. Finally, to answer How the research benefits , the result provides five propositions. The proposition section of the paper outlines several strategies for managers to incorporate and bring to practice the outcome of the study. The authors suggest organizations to focus on developing a comprehensive framework for implementing IoT towards sustainable development, taking into account the interdependencies between different challenges. Such a framework should consider technical, economic, social, and environmental factors and provide guidance to businesses on how to navigate these challenges effectively. This study highlights the understanding and findings of IoT adoption in sustainable development and drives positive change towards a more sustainable future.   6 Conclusion, limitations, and future research direction This study aims to understand the challenges that organizations face while implementing IoT towards sustainable development. The authors first explore the concept of sustainable development which involves integrating environmental practices and principles into a company’s operations, and how the SDGs framework established by the United Nations helps in providing a blueprint for companies to achieve sustainable development. Evolutionary concepts such as I4.0 and CE further promote the use of digital technology like IoT for achieving sustainability. To identify challenges of adopting IoT, the study follows a PRISMA approach, and the authors list twelve challenges such as ‘Loss of value appropriation’, ‘Less adoption of sustainable practices’, ‘Lack of interoperability’, ‘Privacy & security concerns’, ‘Low incentive to change’, ‘Geographical disparity’, ‘Complex design issues’, ‘Lack of awareness about emerging technologies’, ‘Economical challenges’, ‘Ambiguous regulations and policies’, ‘Inconsistent progress tracking’ and ‘Environmental issues’. To analyze the identified challenges, the study employs F-ISM and MICMAC analysis. The result illustrates the interrelationship of the challenges and highlights the considerations to be adopted by industry practitioners for designing strategies that would effectively help in resolving the issues. The study concludes by prioritizing these four challenges i.e., ‘Loss of value appropriation’, ‘Low incentive to change’, ‘Less adoption of sustainable practices’ and ‘Lack of interoperability’, based on their analysis using F-ISM and MICMAC analysis. In addition to identifying the interrelationship between the identified challenges, the authors also present five propositions, implications of the study, and future directions for expansion of the work. Future research initiatives are suggested for the development of a comprehensive framework to implement IoT towards sustainability. Finally, it is argued that businesses need to develop effective strategies for navigating these challenges and promoting sustainable development successfully. To adopt IoT in sustainable development, the role of digitalization should be explored in promoting sustainability. Managers can also aim to improve the reputation of the organization and attract environmentally conscious customers and investors by adopting sustainable practices and tracking progress towards sustainability. Furthermore, companies must develop strategies to engage with stakeholders at all levels to build trust and legitimacy around sustainability and the company. The study utilized the PRISMA method to identify challenges related to the implementation of IoT towards sustainable development, focusing primarily on businesses. However, the review process was limited to Scopus repository, and other databases like Web of Science and IEEE Xplore can be included. The authors acknowledge that expert opinions obtained during the survey data collection for the F-ISM implementation may have subjectivity involved, but cross-validation using methods like the Delphi method can help improve accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, it is important to note that the F-ISM and MICMAC analysis methods used rely on expert opinions and assumptions, which may not always reflect the reality of businesses’ experiences in implementing IoT towards sustainable development. To address this limitation, the F-ISM model generated can be validated against the actual business environment using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). While the study provides valuable insights into challenges related to implementing IoT towards sustainable development in businesses, it is essential to acknowledge that the findings may not be generalizable to other contexts or sectors. To broaden the scope of research, future studies can explore challenges related to implementing IoT in other sectors such as energy, transportation, etc. Finally, researchers can also investigate emerging approaches from developed nations, such as the United States, to gather more insight into the implementation of IoT towards sustainability.   Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
