                  This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 19,235 publications on Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) from 2015 to 2023, underlining its critical role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Focusing on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), the research highlights WPT's significant contributions to sustainability across economic, environmental, and social realms. Utilizing Biblioshiny and VOSviewer, we extract and visualize key insights into WPT's recent progress, technological applications, top keywords, publication trends, geographical distribution, and thematic clusters. Our findings indicate a strong emphasis on sustainable energy solutions, with 1589 publications directly related to SDG 7. WPT also supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) with 56 publications and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) with 171 publications, contributing to resilient infrastructure and sustainable urban development. Moreover, the study uncovers WPT's potential in environmental conservation, with notable attention to SDG 14 (Life Below Water) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The synergy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with WPT is emphasized for enhancing efficiency and broad application in areas such as affordable energy, agricultural yields, health standards, digital education, and water purification. Despite challenges like financial constraints, technical hurdles, and environmental concerns, the paper suggests innovative solutions through funding, research, environmental assessments, and collaborative policymaking. Highlighting the promise of state-of-the-art WPT techniques, this analysis advocates for democratizing technology access in marginalized regions, presenting WPT as a pivotal tool for a sustainable, equitable future aligned with the SDGs.

Traditional approaches to the distribution of electricity are associated with substantial inefficiencies, resulting in notable losses during the processes of transmission and storage [1 ,2 ]. WPT systems that utilize resonant inductive coupling, radio waves, or other advanced techniques such as lasers provide the potential for increased efficiency and decreased energy wastage [3–5 ]. Furthermore, the technology exhibits compatibility with renewable energy sources, hence enabling the development of integrated, efficient, and environmentally friendly power ecosystems [6 ,7 ]. As an illustration, solar power plants have the potential to send electricity wirelessly to far areas, a feature that holds significant value, especially in poor countries with limited access to a comprehensive power distribution network. WPT plays a significant role in facilitating global connectivity and promoting the democratization of technology. The construction of physical infrastructure to support power generation is a resource-intensive and time-consuming endeavor, particularly in geographically isolated or economically disadvantaged regions. WPT has the potential to surpass conventional infrastructure, much like how mobile networks have circumvented landline systems in several regions of the developing world. This facilitates expedited and fairer attainment of energy, so enabling the associated advantages encompassing education, healthcare, and economic progress [8 ,9 ]. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a comprehensive and inclusive appeal for collective action aimed at eradicating poverty, safeguarding the environment, and fostering universal well-being and tranquility by the year 2030 [10 ,11 ]. The SDGs, consisting of 17 interconnected goals, serve as a collective framework for a more favorable future. Establishing a connection between research and these goals is of utmost importance. Research plays a crucial role in facilitating informed decision-making by furnishing essential facts and valuable insights [12 ,13 ]. This, in turn, facilitates the formulation of evidence-based policies and strategies that successfully tackle intricate difficulties. Additionally, it facilitates the cultivation of novelty, hence facilitating the advancement of novel technologies and resolutions in domains such as sustainable energy, nourishment stability, medical services, and pedagogy [14–16 ]. Continual research enables the monitoring and evaluation of advancements made in the pursuit of the SDGs, hence promoting transparency and accountability [17 ,18 ]. The achievement of the SDGs necessitates the adoption of a multidisciplinary approach, since the goals are intricately interwoven. By establishing connections between research conducted in many sectors, cooperation may be fostered, leading to the development of comprehensive and integrated solutions. Furthermore, via research, it is possible to discern the requirements and ambitions of underrepresented populations, so guaranteeing inclusivity and ensuring that policies and interventions are formulated with a focus on social fairness and justice. In summary, the SDGs provide a strategic framework for attaining a world that is both sustainable and inclusive, fostering prosperity [19 ,20 ]. By aligning research efforts with these objectives, it can enhance the capacity to accomplish them via the use of knowledge, creativity, cooperation, and a dedicated dedication to enhancing the well-being of humanity. Fig. 1   summaries the important of linking research to the SDGs [21–24 ]. Moreover, several papers, such as Sharifi et al. [25 ], have delved into how smart city technologies can support SDGs, especially in enhancing urban sustainability, energy, and water management. This study highlight both the potential and the challenges of such technologies, including privacy and cybersecurity concerns, against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has emphasized their importance for health and climate goals. This underscores the need for robust policy frameworks to ensure these technologies contribute positively to sustainable urban development. While Yousef et al. [26 ] have explored the role of concentrated solar power (CSP) to the SDGs. The main aim of this study is to conduct an in-depth bibliometric analysis of WPT technologies, analyzing publications from 2015 to 2023 to explore their contribution to SDGs. The study refines its objectives to include the utilization of Biblioshiny and VOSviewer for data extraction and visualization. This involves analyzing advancements in WPT technologies, focusing on their recent progress, applications, and the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing their contribution to the SDGs. It also includes identifying and visualizing key trends in WPT research, such as top keywords, publication trends, and geographical distribution, to understand the global landscape of WPT research and its alignment with SDG priorities. Further objectives include examining thematic clusters within WPT publications to discern the main areas of focus and their relevance to specific SDGs, particularly emphasizing SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being). The study also aims to highlight the challenges and barriers in the field of WPT, exploring innovative solutions to promote the broader adoption of WPT technologies and recommending strategic approaches for leveraging WPT to advance a wider range of SDGs. This emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary research, policy support, and international collaboration. The research questions explore the recent progress and technological advancements in WPT, the reflection of global engagement within the WPT community through publication trends and geographical distribution, and the alignment of thematic clusters with SDG goals. Questions also investigate the contribution of AI to WPT, challenges and barriers to WPT adoption revealed by bibliometric analysis, ways WPT technology can democratize technology access in marginalized regions, and specific recommendations to ensure WPT technologies effectively accelerate progress towards achieving a broader set of SDGs.  2 Bibliometric analysis methodology In order to meet the previously defined objectives, we utilized traditional bibliometric methods to carry out a quantitative assessment of the amount of scholarly content contained within the WPT literature. This approach was enriched by applying text mining techniques, giving us a qualitative understanding of research trends, subject areas, top keywords, publication trends, and the global distribution of articles related to WPT. Our methodological approach and analysis were built upon a number of earlier bibliometric studies [27–35 ]. Our research drew upon the bibliographic database from the Scopus platform, gathered on July 31, 2023. We chose Scopus as our primary resource because it offers a comprehensive and unbiased collection of abstracts and citations, featuring over 25,100 titles from more than 5000 international publishers (https://www.elsevier.com ), which encompasses a vast array of research subjects. The methodology utilized in this study can be divided into three main stages: data collection, data cleansing, and data analysis, as represented in Fig. 2  . This figure reveals the specific query string used to amass relevant literature, capturing all conceivable spelling variants and types of WPT. Our research was limited to publications originally written in English. After the initial search, to the period from 2015 until 2023, we retrieved a total of 19,235 publications. The query string shown in Fig. 2  was employed to conduct the primary bibliometric analysis. Still, for each specific study, we supplemented this with additional keywords, such as assessing the contributions of WPT to the SDGs. The query utilized for the analysis can be found in the appendix. 2.1 Data collection and sources The main aim of this research is to conduct a bibliometric study on the topic of WPT and explore its contributions to the SDGs. In addition to this, the study aims to investigate the challenges and barriers faced by WPT and to examine the potential role and integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing the efficiency and application of WPT, especially in relation to achieving the SDGs. To accomplish these objectives, the extracted data will be analyzed through four distinct paths. The first path involves analyzing the overall publication trends in the field of WPT. The second path focuses on identifying publications that contribute to WPT's role in achieving the SDGs, using a predefined Scopus query string. The third path centers on exploring the specific challenges and barriers faced by WPT, as identified in the work by Olabi and Abdelkareem [36 ]. Lastly, the fourth path will examine the role and integration of AI in WPT, with a focus on their potential to enhance efficiency and contribute to the SDGs. The bibliographic data from each of these paths will be processed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer tools to extract relevant information.  2.2 Data management and statistical analysis techniques 2.2.1 Biblioshiny Biblioshiny is an effective software application built using the R programming language, with the primary objective of streamlining quantitative research on scholarly publications. The software provides a diverse array of metrics and visualization capabilities for doing bibliometric analysis on large-scale bibliographic datasets, including articles, journals, and authors [28 ,29 ,37–39 ]. Biblioshiny facilitates the importation and processing of data from several sources, including Scopus and Web of Science, therefore catering to the needs of scholars. The program facilitates a range of research endeavors involving data analysis, including co-citation and co-word analysis, scientific subject mapping, and cooperation network exploration.  2.2.2 VOSviewer VOSviewer, a software application developed by Leiden University, serves the purpose of generating and displaying bibliometric networks and maps. This tool enables the evaluation of large volumes of bibliographic data, including articles, journals, and authors, to form co-citation networks, co-word networks, and maps of scientific domains [27 ,31 ]. By mapping the links between publications, authors, journals, institutions, and keywords, VOSviewer allows researchers to construct representations of bibliometric data.

The transmitting and the receiving circuits are wirelessly connected using two coils superimposed on each other as shown in Fig. 3  . The transmitting coil utilizes the Biot-Savart to generate a magnetic field B  based on the applied current I  through the power source as shown by the equation [42 ,43 ]:B = N μ 0   4 π   ∮ I d I  × r  | r |  3       where μ 0     is the constant of permeability in free space, N  is the number of turns of the transmitting coil, d I     is the differential length through which the current flows and r  is the distance vector between the source of current and the point at which the field is calculated. The transmitted magnetic field links with the receiving coil, producing a voltage according to Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction [44 ,45 ], which states that an induced voltage V  equals the negative time rate of change of magnetic flux φ B    , through a receiving coil with N  number of turns.V = − N ∂ φ B   ∂ t        Inductive coupling finds widespread applications in different fields such as charging smartphones, laptops, medical implants, and EVs wirelessly. The removal of physical connectors enhances durability, mobility and the overall safety of operation. Furthermore, inductive coupling facilitates the wireless transfer of data between devices, underpinning technologies like near-field communication (NFC) for secure, short-range data exchange between devices like smartphones and payment terminals. In the sphere of industrial automation, it plays a critical role where inductive sensors and couplers are used to transmit power and data between different parts of automated machinery, allowing for contactless connections that minimize wear and tear.

It also allows for misalignment between the coils, offering more flexible charging and connection possibilities. Safety is another strong suit, as the lack of exposed conductive parts makes it more suitable for wet or harsh environments, and electrical isolation between the primary and secondary circuits further reduces risks. However, this method is full of limitations. Its transfer efficiency can be lower than conductive methods, particularly when there is significant misalignment or distance between the coils. The components required can also lead to higher costs, and the range is typically confined, demanding proximity between the primary and secondary coils. Moreover, interference from other electronic devices or metal objects can hinder performance. Recent advancements in the field focus on mitigating these limitations and enhancing the technology further. Adaptive systems that dynamically adjust parameters such as frequency, alignment, and impedance are being developed to enhance efficiency [48 ,49 ]. Additionally, integrating inductive components with sophisticated control circuits paves the way for more compact, cost-effective, and intelligent solutions.

The fundamental principles of MRC are rooted in the idea of using resonant circuits to create a strong coupling between the source and receiver, facilitating the transfer of power across a distance with higher efficiency. Both the transmitting and receiving coils in this system are parallel connected to capacitors, forming resonant circuits. These circuits are fine-tuned to resonate at the same frequency, creating a strong resonance between them. The resonant frequency f   can be selected by either changing the capacitance C   of the capacitors or the inductance L   of the coils as is described as [52 ,53 ]:f = 1 2 π   L C        This resonance permits efficient power transfer over a distance without significant loss. Proper tuning and impedance matching are vital components of this process, ensuring that the energy is transferred efficiently from the source to the load. Fig. 4   shows a simplified block diagram of MRC. The advantages of resonant coupling are numerous and notable. Its ability to achieve higher efficiency in power transfer, especially over medium distances, sets it apart. The greater range of operation and the lack of necessity for precise alignment during charging enhances flexibility and convenience for users. Furthermore, the technology's resonance ensures that energy is transferred primarily between the tuned coils, thereby reducing interference with other nearby electronic devices [4 ,54 ]. However, resonant coupling is not without limitations. Its design complexity can pose challenges, as it requires careful tuning and matching of the resonant circuits.

While our investigation into the impact of WPT on the SDGs has yielded significant insights, we must acknowledge several limitations that present opportunities for further research and refinement. Our study encompassed 19,235 publications, with a notable focus on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. However, the distribution of research emphasis might not fully capture the multifaceted impacts of WPT across all SDGs, with lesser attention on goals such as SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth and SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. Future studies should aim to broaden the scope of literature review to include more diverse sources and interdisciplinary research, potentially uncovering additional pathways through which WPT contributes to various SDGs. The pronounced focus on contributions from prominent nations like the United States and China may also overlook WPT's potential impact in less researched or developing regions, where the technology could significantly address sustainability challenges. A broader geographical scope of research could provide a more global perspective on WPT's applications and benefits. Additionally, while our conclusion highlights the numerical distribution of publications across different SDGs, a deeper quantitative analysis is lacking. Future research incorporating meta-analysis or systematic review methodology could quantitatively assess the impact of WPT research on achieving specific SDGs, offering a more nuanced understanding of the field's progress. Furthermore, our study briefly touches on technical hurdles and radiation safety concerns associated with WPT but lacks a detailed exploration of these challenges. Subsequent research should delve deeper into these issues, including the environmental impacts of widespread WPT adoption and exploring solutions to mitigate these challenges. The necessity for comprehensive policy frameworks to ensure the safe and equitable implementation of WPT is recognized, yet specific recommendations for such frameworks are not detailed. Future work focusing on the development of detailed policy and regulatory recommendations will be crucial for the successful integration of WPT into sustainable development efforts, necessitating collaboration with policymakers, stakeholders, and regulatory bodies. By addressing these limitations and following the suggested pathways for future research, the field can advance towards realizing the full potential of WPT in contributing to the SDGs, aiming for a more sustainable, interconnected, and equitable global future.
