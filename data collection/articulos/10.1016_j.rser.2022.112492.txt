                  South Asia, a developing region housing almost a quarter of the world population, faces stringent energy and environmental problems including acute vulnerability to climate change. To improve their socioeconomics and achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is imperative for South Asian countries to address their energy and environmental challenges. A thorough review of the national and regional achievements and challenges concerning SDGs is important for finding fast and sustainable solutions. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the energy and environmental outlook for the region taking into account the faced challenges and their potential solutions. It also aims to examine the prospects of the relevant SDGs taking into account the accomplishments and the faced challenges. It maps the progress South Asian countries have made towards the concerned seven SDGs - SDG6, SDG7, SDG11, SDG12, SDG13, SDG14, and SDG15-also identifying the challenges ahead. The article undertakes a thorough review of the literature including national and regional reports on energy and environmental scenarios and the SDGs. It finds that although South Asian countries have made considerable progress in power generation capacity and rural electrification, they face serious challenges with regard to SDG6, SDG7, and SDG11. South Asian countries need to benefit from their vast renewable energy potential and align their energy sectors with the trends of the unfolding sustainable energy transition. To achieve the targeted SDGs, concentrated efforts are required especially in terms of governmental support, budget allocation, and robust policy formulation and implementation.

Architectural Engineering Department King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals KSA Saudi Arabia       South Asia, a developing region housing almost a quarter of the world population, faces stringent energy and environmental problems including acute vulnerability to climate change. To improve their socioeconomics and achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is imperative for South Asian countries to address their energy and environmental challenges. A thorough review of the national and regional achievements and challenges concerning SDGs is important for finding fast and sustainable solutions. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the energy and environmental outlook for the region taking into account the faced challenges and their potential solutions. It also aims to examine the prospects of the relevant SDGs taking into account the accomplishments and the faced challenges. It maps the progress South Asian countries have made towards the concerned seven SDGs - SDG6, SDG7, SDG11, SDG12, SDG13, SDG14, and SDG15-also identifying the challenges ahead. The article undertakes a thorough review of the literature including national and regional reports on energy and environmental scenarios and the SDGs. It finds that although South Asian countries have made considerable progress in power generation capacity and rural electrification, they face serious challenges with regard to SDG6, SDG7, and SDG11. South Asian countries need to benefit from their vast renewable energy potential and align their energy sectors with the trends of the unfolding sustainable energy transition. To achieve the targeted SDGs, concentrated efforts are required especially in terms of governmental support, budget allocation, and robust policy formulation and implementation.

The provision of adequate and affordable energy services is crucial to sustain a modern lifestyle and to address major socio-economic challenges such as poverty, hunger, disease, and illiteracy. Poor and inadequate access to secure and affordable energy is hindering the progress of developing countries. Electricity, for example, is vital for providing basic social services such as education and health, water supply and purification, sanitation, and refrigeration of essential medicines. Electricity can also help support a wide range of income-generating opportunities. For its importance, the per capita energy consumption is used as an index to measure the socio-economic prosperity in any society - the United Nation's Human Development Index (HDI) has a strong relationship with energy prosperity [1 ,2 ]. The global energy demand is experiencing rapid growth. According to the International Energy Agency (IAE), the world energy requirement will grow by nearly 30% between 2015 and 2040. This growth is mostly expected to come from the developing world as the countries outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are likely to accounts for over 60% of this growth in energy demand [3 ]. The rapid growth in energy demand in developing countries is driven by factors like burgeoning population, urbanization, modernization, and economic and infrastructure development. By the end of 2019, the world population grew to over 7.7 billion [4 ]. In 2008 for the first time in history nearly half of the global population lived in urban areas. It is estimated that by 2050 around 68% of the population will be living in urban areas. Projections also suggest that by 2030 most of the urbanization is set to take place in the lesser developed part of the world, - the towns and cities of the developing countries will make up 81% of the urban population [5 ]. The energy landscape of the world is closely linked to its environmental scenario. This is particularly true given the fact that fossil fuels, contributing to almost 80% of the global energy supplies, are considered to be the prime source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In the backdrop of the growing concerns about climate change, widely regarded to be a consequence of human use of fossil fuel, the global energy and environmental scenarios are becoming increasingly interwoven [6 ]. Like energy security, a healthy natural environment is also vital for the socio-economic well-being of societies. Environmental challenges are becoming a serious concern in the world. Climate change is truly a global issue in its very nature. It is set to affect all countries though the impact will not be uniform. The poor and developing countries, especially the low-lying and small island nations, are projected to be affected earliest and the most. Ironically, the developing countries will suffer the most despite having a marginal contribution in terms of greenhouse gas emissions [7 ]. With the growing world population and people's innate aspirations for an improved life, a central and collective global issue in the 21st century is to sustain socio-economic growth within the constraints of the Earth's limited natural resources while at the same time preserving the environment. This target - sustainable development - can only be met by ensuring energy and environmental sustainability. Following up on its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations (UN) adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to promote energy and environmental sustainability. South Asia is one of the most populous regions in the world, home to almost a quarter of the world population. Countries in the region – Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka – are suffering from wide-ranging energy and environmental problems affecting the socio-economic well-being of their societies. Energy and environmental challenges faced by South Asia have been explored by researchers from different perspectives. Energy generation and consumption trends in the region, for example, have been discussed in several studies [8–11 ]. The fuel poverty situation in the region has been discussed in the context of socio-economic factors [12 ]. Similarly, energy security in the region has been explored in terms of regional cooperation and economic factors [13 ]. Energy security in the region has also been explored in relation to its environmental scenario [14 ]. The relationship between energy, environment and economics has also been investigated by researchers [15 ]. The relationship between energy and environmental sustainability, and SDGs has been explored in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa [16 ]. From the South Asian perspective, food, water, and energy nexus have been explored towards achieving SDGs [17 ]. Greenhouse gas emissions and prospects of renewable energy in the region have also been examined by researchers [18–25 ]. It is therefore evident that existing studies have largely focused on individual topics within the broader energy and environmental domains. A holistic account of energy and environmental scenarios is still lacking in the literature. South Asian countries adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. The subject of SDGs is relatively new to the research community and needs to be discussed in the context of the broader energy and environmental sustainability outlook of the region. This article aims to bridge the gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive review of the energy and environmental sustainability situation in South Asia from the perspective of SDGs. In addition, it maps the progress made by countries in the region in achieving the relevant SDGs. Furthermore, it identifies the challenges facing the region and the opportunities to improve its energy and environmental prospects. The article thus has the following novelty:• The study provides a comprehensive account of the broader energy and environmental challenges facing South Asia  • It covers all of the seven South Asian counties  • It relates the energy and environmental outlook of the region with the Sustainable Development Goals  • It maps the progress South Asian countries have made with regards to relevant SDGs, also identifying the faced challenges  • It makes recommendations to improve energy and environmental sustainability and to achieve SDGs    In terms of structure, after the first section, Introduction, the paper has four main sections. Section 2  presents the methodology of this study. Section 3  provides an overview of South Asia in terms of geographic and socio-economic details. Section 4  provides a background to SDGs in terms of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), before discussing the SDGs related to energy and environmental sustainability. Section 5  provides a detailed account of South Asia around these seven SDGs, taking into account the pertinent issues and challenges faced by the regional countries. It also describes the South Asian countries’ response to the faced challenges. Section 6  discusses the important findings of the studies and makes recommendations to improve the energy and environmental scenario of the region.  2 Methodology This study reviews the energy and environmental outlook for South Asia in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study has targeted seven SDGs that have close and direct relevance with the critical aspects of energy and environmental sustainability. These include:• SDG 6, dealing with clean water and sanitation  • SDG 7, dealing with affordable and clean energy  • SDG 11, dealing with sustainable cities and communities  • SDG 12, dealing with responsible consumption and production  • SDG 13, dealing with climate change  • SDG 14, dealing with life below water  • SDG 15, dealing with life on land    The study classifies these SDGs in terms of their predominant energy or environmental position. SDG 7, for example, predominantly deals with energy while SDG 6, SDG 14, and SDG 15 deal with the environment. SDG 11, SDG 12, and SDG 13 have both energy and environmental positioning as shown in Fig. 1  . To better present the context of SDGs, the paper also provides an overview of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the performance South Asian countries made around these. An account of South Asia, covering the seven countries - Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sir Lanka - that have traditionally been part of the region, has been provided from the perspective of the faced energy and environmental challenges. The present work gathers the dispersed data and information about all the regional countries consulting government reports, policy documents, research studies, and reports by the relevant developmental organizations and international bodies. The comprehensive data collection was followed by in-depth analyses to develop a coherent account of the energy and environmental performance of all countries around the targeted SDGs.  3 Overview of south Asia South Asia is one of the most populous regions of the world, as it houses over 23% of the global population in just 3% of the world's total area. Situated in the southern part of Asia, the region has traditionally been regarded to consist of seven sub-Himalayan nations: Bangladesh Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, as shown in Fig. 2  . South Asia, as a region, exhibits a rich history and culture. A comparative overview of the South Asian countries, as presented in Table 1  , indicates the huge diversity in terms of population and geographic size [26–28 ]. It can be observed that except for the Maldives, other countries are in close socio-economic proximity. Despite being a set of developing countries, South Asia exhibits a tremendous potential for progress and development, as more than 55% of its population is below 30 years of age [29 ]. In recent years the region has seen industrialization and infrastructure development trends and has benefited from a significant foreign investment [30 ]. South Asia as a region suffers from geopolitical hostilities. There is a wide range of rivalries amongst the member countries. Border and territorial disputes, and other issues have resulted in wars and civil unrest. There are disputes around river waters as well. South Asia continues to suffer from these issues and a considerable proportion of the regional wealth goes into military spending. The situation has affected regional cooperation as well undermining the efforts towards tackling the energy and environmental challenges.  4 Millennium development goals to sustainable development goals To combat socio-economic issues such as poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, and environmental degradation, United Nations adopted eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the year 2000. The eight target goals of (MDG) were to:• Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  • Achieve universal primary education  • Promote gender equality and empower women  • Reduce child mortality  • Improve maternal health  • Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases  • Ensure environmental sustainability  • To develop a global partnership for development    South Asia actively participated in the drive for MDGs and tried to achieve the targets by the year 2015. Most of the MDGs viz ., poverty alleviation, food security, basic education, gender equality, and infant mortality were accomplished by some of the South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal [31–33 ]. However, countries with larger populations - India and Pakistan - missed some of their targets viz ., eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, reducing child mortality, and improving maternal health [34 ]. Maldives and Bhutan showed a mixed performance in terms of MDGs [35 ,36 ]. Despite achieving considerable success in accomplishing MDGs [37 ], South Asian countries continue to suffer from the concerned issues and are globally ranked very low in terms of the Human Development Index (HDI) [38 ]. After MDGs, the region proactively adopted the more ambitious United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. Better accepted as “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”  comprises 17 SDGs (as shown in Fig. 3  ) and 169 targets evaluated by 234 indicators. Seven of these SDGs are related to energy and environmental sustainability as explained in Table 2   in terms of targeted indicators. The first six goals of SDGs were adopted from MDGs and other new goals were introduced for inclusive and sustainable growth, development, clean energy, and climate change and its related impacts.  5 South ASIA’S progress on sustainable development goals The 2030 Agenda encompasses the three core dimensions of sustainability - economic, social, and environmental development. Despite its relatively minor contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, South Asia faces substantial environmental issues and is one of the most sensitive and exposed regions to climate change's effects. While natural disasters such as floods, landslides, agriculture loss, and infrastructure loss are becoming more common in India, Bhutan, and Nepal, coastal regions in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives are facing saltwater intrusion and population displacement. Countries in the region also risk draught and unexpected monsoons with massive implications on agriculture, infrastructure, and thus economic and social life. The susceptibility of South Asian countries to extreme climate impacts is highlighted in Table 3  . South Asian countries are trying to address the challenges towards the accomplishment of SDGs they adopted in 2015 [41 ]. In the following sections, energy and environmental scenario of the region is discussed in the context of the pertinent SDGs. 5.1 SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation  SDG 6, dealing with clean water and sanitation, is built upon the MDGs. It is estimated that 40% of the global population is facing water scarcity and approximately one billion people do not have access to basic sanitation. These challenges are being aggravated by global warming as an increasing number of countries are experiencing water stress, and are facing drought and desertification risks. By 2050, it is projected that at least one in four people will suffer from recurring water shortages. Water scarcity has a multi-dimensional impact on society and the environment. Water scarcity also leads to sanitation and hygiene issues [42 ]. South Asia lacks access to safe drinking water as 68–84% of water sources are contaminated. In South Asia, annually around 177,000 children die because of diarrhea caused by poor sanitation and hygiene and unsafe drinking water [43 ]. Being prominently an agrarian region, South Asia faces dire water scarcity. Agriculture accounts for about 90% of the water and about 20% of energy use [44 ]. Water scarcity also worsens the problems of hunger and malnutrition. It also affects hydropower output, a prominent renewable energy resource in South Asia. Thus, SDG 6 is, thus, intrinsically linked to all other Sustainable Development Goals. Most of the South Asian countries nearly achieved the target of safe water and sanitation under MDG, however, SDG 6 requires further improvement in the situation. India started some robust schemes like National Rural Drinking Water Programme to optimize water resource utilization in the country. Around 72% of the rural population in India has access to safe and adequate drinking water [45 ]. Nepal has shown remarkable progress in SDG 6 with its 88% population having basic water supply coverage and 46% population having basic sanitation facilities. Piped water availability within 30 min distance from the abode has been assured by the Nepalese government [46 ]. In Pakistan, the quality of water is a major challenge resulting in water-borne diseases [47 ]. Bhutan is regarded to be on track to meet the SDGs, with 98% of people having better access to water resources and 63% of households having 24-h access to drinking water [48 ]. Sri Lanka is also considered an early achiever in SDG 6 by providing clean and safe drinking water to 92% of its citizens, and safe sanitation to 94% of the population [49 ]. The Maldives has managed the water availability but lacks in sanitation. Bangladesh has also improved safe drinking water access. Overall, South Asia has made remarkable progress towards SDG6 by providing access to drinking water, however, the situation with basic sanitation and hygiene remains to be a challenge. One of the bottlenecks in the accomplishment of SDG 6 is the cost of sustainable wastewater treatment. Country-wise data on access to safe drinking water and sanitation are presented in Table 4  .  5.2 SDG 7: affordable and clean energy Lack of access to reliable and affordable energy is another major challenge affecting the socio-economic prosperity in South Asia. On one hand, the region is experiencing a growth in cumulative greenhouse gas emissions due to economic growth and industrialization, and on the other hand, it faces a challenge to control the emission because of being the most vulnerable region to climate change. The pivot of choosing development over the environment is a dilemma for the South Asian countries. SDG 7 calls for access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. It targets uninterrupted energy access from clean and renewable resources. South Asia is facing acute energy challenges as access to affordable and refined energy resources is a major issue especially for the rural and remote communities. In recent years, several countries in the region have undertaken rural electrification programs. However, despite the significant progress made, nearly 20% of the population in South Asia still lack access to electricity. Also, nearly 55% of the total population rely on raw biomass to meet cooking and heating needs as shown in Table 5  . It is also noteworthy that the term electrification does not essentially mean a reliable and adequate supply of electricity. South Asian countries are heavily suffering from the unreliability of the electric grid. Globally, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, the three biggest nations in the region, have very low standing in terms of grid reliability with respective positions of 108, 99, and 68 out of 140 countries in the world as shown in Table 6  . India has the greatest energy demand in the region due to its large population and intense development in recent years. Overview of South Asia's energy consumption and supply mix is provided in Table 7   and Fig. 4   respectively. In recent years South Asian countries have largely experienced considerable economic growth [51 ]. A vital input to sustain this economic growth is energy, the demand of which has increased by 80% since the year 2000. The ambitious target of 100% electrification is further increasing the energy requirements [52 ]. Although the region is bestowed with varied renewable energy resources, a large part of it is untapped. Hydropower, for example, with an estimated potential of over 350,000 MW has seen only 13% utilization so far. The usage of low-cost coal and significant dependence on energy imports are key highlights of the region's energy scenario. Bangladesh, India, Maldives, and Pakistan primarily depend on non-renewable resources for energy generation. Bhutan and Nepal are two of the most energy sustainable countries in terms of renewable energy usage. Energy import dependency is noticed to be highest for the Maldives due to the lack of indigenous fossil fuel and high energy requirements by transportation, infrastructure, and tourism sectors. Region's energy demand trend till 2030 predicts even a greater dependence on non-renewable energy. The potential for renewable energy in SA is highlighted in Table 8  . Bhutan is regarded to have the most sustainable energy outlook based on selected indicators viz.,  energy import dependency, energy intensity, per capita consumption, and forest area. Bhutan is followed by India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh in terms of energy sustainability. The lack of energy supplies from indigenous resources poses a question mark on the energy sustainability of the region. The development of renewable energy is also crucial towards limiting greenhouse gas emissions.  5.3 SDG 11: sustainable cities and communities The 11th SDG deals with making human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. It targets providing good housing, continuous water and electricity, proper waste management, easy transport, and a good standard of living. Poverty, unemployment, and hunger in rural areas of South Asia is attracting people to urban areas. SDG 11 primarily deals with the population dwelling in urban areas and is highly influenced by energy utilization, climate change, and other social and economic goals of SDG. Approximately 55.7% i.e. 4.2 billion of the global population is residing in urban areas [57 ], which is expected to increase to 68%, reaching up to 6.3 billion people by 2050 [58 ]. South Asia which is presently the least urbanized region is anticipated to host 90% of this increase. The region presently has 36.6% of the urban population, as shown in Table 9  , which is expected to increase by more than half by 2050. The primary reason for urbanization is the migration of people from rural to urban areas in search of better income and quality of life, but it often leads to an increase in the number of slum dwellers in urban areas with the least possible basic amenities and compromised living standards. Intense urbanization puts immense pressure on the living environment viz ., freshwater resources, soils, and vegetation cover, with direct and indirect consequences on social relations, security, energy, and public health. The region also experiences cross-border migration between countries like Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. Another major obstruction in paving the way for SDG 11 is waste generation and its management. Waste-related environmental problems and diseases are common in the region. The region has 0.52 kg/capita/day of average waste generation in comparison to a global average of 0.74 kg/capita/day. The Maldives though have the least daily waste generation but have the highest per capita waste generation. Given the intense challenges, the human development index of the South Asian countries is shown in Fig. 5  . The success of SDG 11 depends on many other SDGs like hunger, poverty, education, health, water and sanitation, electricity, governance, and many others. The sustainability of urbanization also decides the status of the environment and biodiversity. South Asian countries lag far behind the developed nations in terms of quality of life indicators such as purchase power, health index, safety index as well as pollution index. Fig. 6   provides an overview of SA countries in terms of various indexes for quality life in SA. It can be observed that apart from Bhutan and Maldives which lack evaluation data; India leads in quality of life index followed by Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. Except for Bhutan, all other countries have a very high pollution index which can relate to many other consequences. Under SDG 11, India has initiated a proactive mission entitled Smart City Mission  in 2016 for providing easy, innovative, and digital solutions to urban problems. The modernization and digitalization of security systems, waste management, governance, transport to make life comfortable are some major initiatives under the smart city mission .  5.4 SDG 12: responsible consumption and production SDG 12 emphasizes encouraging sustainable infrastructure, green economies, and the efficient use of natural resources. It also focuses on reducing pollution, environmental degradation, and waste minimization. The world population is expected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050 which will require three planets to acquire natural resources to sustain the current lifestyle [62 ]. The estimation is often termed as Ecological Footprints  which is an indicator that accounts for human demand on global biological resources. Biocapacity  is a measure of available bio-resources. A country having a footprint higher than biocapacity face an ecological deficit. Fig. 7   illustrates the ecological footprints and biocapacity of South Asian countries. Reduction in carbon emission remains to be a challenge as the global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to more than $400 billion in 2018 [64 ]. Solid waste management (including e-waste) and air pollution (SOx , NOx , and PM) are the prime focus of all developing nations under SDG 12. Most of the polluted cities of India have a high concentration of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). The major sectors responsible for SO2  and NOx  emission in the South Asian region are illustrated in Fig. 8  . South Asian countries are also suffering from smog due to abundant atmospheric aerosols. Studies suggest that smog can be reduced by 25% by fuel substitution, and black carbon concentration can be reduced by 42% if biofuels are replaced by natural gas in the residential sector [65 ,66 ]. The entire SA is vulnerable to the increased burden of airborne fine particulates from household energy practices, decade-old vehicle's tail-pipe emissions, unscientific waste incineration, crop residue burning, and industries [67 ]. Pollution affects the air quality and so takes a toll on human health. Of the top 30 cities in the world with the poorest air quality in 2016, 17 were in South Asia. COVID-19 yet again highlighted the impacts of human activities including transportation and industry on the air quality as the pandemic-driven lockdown recorded a major change in the air quality scenario across the globe and South Asia was no exception in this. In India, for example, PM10 , PM2.5 , NO2 , and CO levels were reduced by 43, 31, 18, and 10%, respectively, compared to 2017 [68 ]. Delhi which is often criticized as Hot Gas Chamber,  witnessed 50% reduction PM10  and PM2.5  concentrations when compared with the pre-lockdown period. Moreover, during the lockdown period, NO2  levels dropped by 52.7% and CO levels dropped by 30.4% [69 ]. In the post-COVID-19 phase, it is a major challenge to sustain this improvement.  5.5 SDG 13: climate action Climate change is one of the biggest problems facing the planet. It is affecting all parts of the world in various degrees. South Asia is amongst the most vulnerable regions to the implications of climate change. SDG 13 calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Over 1.0 °C of global warming above the pre-industrial revolution level has already been recorded as a result of anthropogenic activities. The sea level, risen by about 20 cm since 1880, is projected to rise by another 30–122 cm by 2100. Global net CO2  emissions must drop by 45% between 2010 and 2030 to limit warming to 1.5 °C, and should reach net zero by 2050 [70 ,71 ]. Climate change is associated with natural disasters - such as floods, storms, droughts – which are becoming intense and more frequent. South Asia is also experiencing gradually intensifying natural disasters [72 ]. Fig. 9   depicts the number of natural disasters and the resulting loss of lives in recent decades. Flooding is the most common natural disaster affecting almost every country in the region. South Asia has generally had low carbon emissions when compared to the worldwide average, however, factors such as growing population, high rate of urbanization, growing energy needs, and fossil fuel reliance are significantly changing the emission rates. Table 10   provides an overview of the GHG emissions in the region. High energy demand by the power and transport sector contributes to more than half of the GHG emissions in the region. Deployment of clean energy technologies in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka can cut about 245 million tons of CO2  by 2030. Another major source of GHG emissions is improper waste management and disposal. Total GHG emission by Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka is expected to reach 606 million tons of CO2  by 2030 [73 ]. Bhutan is the only country in South Asia that has recorded a reduction in CO2  emission in recent years [74 ]. Some of the actions taken by the South Asian countries in the fight against climate change are presented in Table 11  .  5.6 SDG 14: life below water The SDG 14 focuses on conserving and sustaining the use of oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Globally, oceans play an important role by absorbing 30% of the anthropogenic CO2 , thus, helping in buffering the impacts of global warming. However, oceans are also facing the repercussions of climate change. Coastal areas are more vulnerable to climate change-driven environmental degradation and pollution. Land-based sources of pollution are reaching oceans at an alarming rate as around 13,000 pieces of plastic litter are found on every square kilometer of the ocean threatening marine life including fish [76 ]. The targets under SDG 14 are to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from pollution, deal with the impacts of ocean acidification, conservation and sustainable use of ocean-based resources. Except for Bhutan and Nepal, the rest of South Asian countries are under the South Asian Seas (SAS) region as highlighted in Table 12  . They are broadly categorized as mainland and island nations. The Maldives and Sri Lanka are island nations; Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are situated on the Asian mainland. The marine system within the region includes the Arabian Sea in the west and the Bay of Bengal in the east; and a large area of the open Indian Ocean to the south of India and Sri Lanka. The SAS region is bestowed with rich ecological diversity including mangrove forests, coral reefs, estuaries, river deltas, lagoons, and coastal wetlands which provide natural habitat to diverse species. As per the SDG progress report, the data available on various indicators under SDG 14 is limited. The coverage of coastal and marine regions under conservation protection was a key endeavour under SDG 14. In South Asia, the protected area has increased from 0.16% to 0.24% [77 ]. The region has 6.8% of the global mangroves and coral reefs, which are an important part of its biodiversity [78 ]. Except for the Maldives, all South Asian countries, however, face risks to mangroves, as illustrated in Table 13  , due to the rapid expansion of the shrimp aquaculture business, dam construction, decreasing freshwater, and silt. Loss of mangroves is likely to increase the implications of storms, cyclones, and sea-level rise. Coral reefs are threatened by coral bleaching, sedimentation, overharvesting, destructive fishing methods such as trawling and dynamiting, pollution, and coastal development. Several initiatives have been taken at the regional and national levels to protect the marine life and mangroves with a particular focus on measures like control of extinction of species, sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, prevention of marine pollution, and effective and equitable governance of marine and coastal protected areas [80 ,81 ]. The lack of data under SDG 14 makes it difficult to assess the Goal's long-term viability.  5.7 SDG 15: life on land Human life is dependent on both land and water for sustenance and livelihoods. Forest has an imperative role in cleaning the environment and combating climate change. Escalating resource demand causes the loss of 13 million hectares of forests annually; indirectly affecting the livelihood of many poor communities. Bhutan and Pakistan respectively have the highest and the least forest cover in South Asia. Forests are also critical for biodiversity, flood mitigation, and improvement in local climatic conditions. The region is experiencing deforestation and severe loss of biodiversity. The main reasons for deforestation include human activities such as logging and clear-cutting for food production, cash crops, and agriculture [82 ]. SDG 15 deals with the protection, restoration, and promotion of sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. The target aspires to sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. South Asia however has a mixed response to forest cover with some countries facing an alarming situation as shown in Fig. 10  . While Bhutan and India have recorded improvement, Pakistan already having a very small forest cover has experienced a loss of 83% between 2000 and 2015. The overall terrestrial protected areas (% of total land area) of South Asia is reported to have increased from 5.8% to 7.29% between 2014 and 2018 [84 ]. The number of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas is highlighted in Table 14  . India, despite having recorded the highest number of protected areas, faces the maximum vulnerability in terms of biodiversity loss. Fig. 11   depicts the details of threatened species in South Asia. South Asian countries are active members of most of the biodiversity-related international agreements as shown in Table 15  . Additionally, they have also complied with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020which is a ten-year framework to improve biodiversity.   6 Discussion and recommendations South Asia accounts for two-fifth of the world's income poor and nearly half of the malnourished children [37 ,91 ]. The provision of food, water, and basic health and education services to the region's rising population is a big concern. To address these socio-economic challenges it is critical to have access to reliable and affordable energy supplies. Energy sustainability is often measured in terms of accessibility, affordability, and acceptability in terms of carbon lean renewable energy supplies. South Asia's strive for sustainable development becomes more prodigious due to the high vulnerability of the region towards climate change. Around 70% of the South Asian population depends on agriculture for their livelihood which is worse affected by climate change, also risking economic growth. The region faces serious energy challenges as indicated by the fact that its per capita electricity consumption is almost a quarter of that of the world average. Inefficient, inadequate and, ageing transmission and distribution (T&D) system is also a major challenge as South Asia is only second to Sub-Saharan Africa in terms of grid reliability. Even though the region is endowed with a broad range of renewable energy resources, much of the potential remains untapped due to various reasons including financial, policy and, technical constraints. South Asia is rich in biodiversity and endemism due to its diverse geographic and topographic characteristics, but it is also threatened by the effects of climate change [92 ]. To better address the global sustainable development-related challenges, the United Nations adopted The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  in 2015 encompassing 17 Sustainable Development Goals, 169 targets evaluated by 234 indicators. The SDGs present an important opportunity to South Asia to make development more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable and to end extreme poverty. The precursor of SDGs were the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted in the year 2000 which were believed to have produced one of the most successful anti-poverty movements in the region. Compared to MDGs, SDGs are however more comprehensive in terms of scope and targeted outcomes, and hence are more resource-intensive requiring greater state-level commitment and support [34 ]. Energy- and environmental sustainability, becoming increasingly interwoven, are at the heart of SDGs, which are inter-dependently evident from at least seven of the SDGs. These include SDG 6 dealing with clean water and sanitation; SDG 7 dealing with affordable and clean energy; SDG 11 dealing with sustainable cities and communities; SDG 12 dealing with responsible consumption and production; SDG 13 dealing with climate change; SDG 14 dealing with life below water; and SDG 15 dealing with life on land. A recent report on sustainable development measures the overall score of different countries' total progress towards achieving SDGs. The analysis reviews 85 global indicators for achieving sustainable development. A score of 100 indicates that all SDGs have been achieved, and currently Sweden performs best with a score of 85 [93 ]. Maldives is the leading South Asian country in terms of SDG score followed by Bhutan and Sri Lanka while Pakistan is ranked the least as shown in Fig. 12  . Most of the countries in the region continue to face major challenges towards SDG 6, SDG 7, and SDG 11 as shown in Table 16   [41 ]. While the Maldives is the only country to have achieved SDG 7, it faces the greatest challenges on SDG 13. The Maldives is one of the most vulnerable nations in the world from the implications of climate change, especially from the rising sea level. There has been a good progress made on SDG 12 as only Bhutan continues to experience significant challenges around it. With the exception of Pakistan, all countries face significant challenges around SDG 15. Access to reliable and affordable energy is central to broader socio-economic prosperity in societies. India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, accounting for over 90% of the population in the region are facing significant to major challenges with regards to the SDG7. With challenges like low per capita energy consumption, lack of access to refined energy resources, fragile electric grid, and import dependency, in the foreseeable future energy sustainability is expected to remain a daunting task for the region. Given the interwoven relationship between energy and the environment, improvements on the front of SDG7 will have a positive impact on other SDGs especially those related to climate change and the environment. The observations on the target-wise SDG performance were; lack of data on fresh water withdrawal and wastewater treatment is envisaged by all SA countries under SDG6; Access to clean fuel and CO2  emission is still showing stagnant performance under SDG7; Particulate emission data shows regression trend under SDG11; No data is available on SDG12; Two main indicators on energy-related CO2  emission have shown positive results under SDG13, and biodiversity-related targets show regressive or stagnant trend under SDG14 and SDG15. A more specific overview of the progress on selected indicators of SDG 7, SDG11, and SDG13 is shown in Table 17   [41 ]. The primary goal of sustainability is to improve the quality of life. Although South Asia has made progress in delivering fundamental services – i.e. safe water, food, education, sanitation, and good health - to its population, over 600 million people still lack access to basic sanitation, and 68–84% of water sources are contaminated [94 ]. Trade-offs in favour of economic growth, which can jeopardize social well-being and ecological survival, are a major roadblock towards achieving SDGs [95 ]. Most of the countries in the region are dealing with high population density, which is impeding their efforts to improve inhabitants' living standards. Following recommendations can be made to support the efforts towards the accomplishment of SDGs.• Lessons need to be learned from the experiences of MDGs, which indicate that the limited budgetary allocations, governance issues and biased subsidy systems could become the major reason for the regression of SDGs [96 ,97 ]. Overall, more concentrated efforts, including governmental support, budget allocation, and robust policy formulation and implementation are required.  • Global warming mitigation and adaptation strategies need to be a prime focus in the developmental strategies of SA countries [98 ].  • South Asia is massively suffering from mismanagement in the energy sector. The economic cost of the power sector distortions in the three largest countries in the region - India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh – is estimated to be of the order of US$115 Billion/year [98 ]. To improve their energy and environmental outlook, it is imperative for these nations to better manage their energy sector. Efficiently managed energy sector can not only help reduce losses, but also improve grid reliability and access. It can also help in terms of reduction in energy prices, improvement in revenues, and lower environmental emissions. Harmonization of grid codes and regulatory frameworks and proper pricing mechanism of electricity is required for better performance of utilities. There is need for strong institutional framework and private sector investment  • One of the major shortcomings of the South Asian energy scenario is a lack of regional trade. Countries in the region have struggled to realize the potential and importance of transnational energy trade and cooperation. Estimates suggest that by 2050, through measures like effective policy coordination, grid interconnection, market reforms, trade agreements, and regulation, the region has the potential to upscale the electricity trade up to over 70 GW of projects [99 ].  • The region has a diverse range of renewable energy resources. There is abundant potential for solar energy, wind power, hydropower, and biomass. India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan have huge hydropower resources. Region's total hydropower potential is estimated to be nearly 350 GW. The rich renewable base of the region, if adequately utilized, can help a long way towards improving the energy, environmental and socio-economic conditions of its population, and taking it closer to achieving SDGs.  • In the wake of the Paris Agreement, the world is embracing low-carbon or sustainable energy transition. Switching away from fossil fuels by the middle of the century is at the heart of this energy transition. Several major economies and economic blocks have pledged to the energy transition. The European Union, United Kingdom, and the United States of America, for example, have plans to go zero-carbon by 2050. China has announced to be zero carbon by 2060 while India has committed to net-zero emissions by 2070 [100 ]. The unfolding energy transition has four major dimensions (4Ds): decarbonization, decreasing use of energy, decentralization and digitalization [101 ,102 ]. To achieve SDG 7, it is important for South Asian nations to align their energy sectors with the trends and best practices of the sustainable energy transition.  • The COVID-19 is a wake-up call for the South Asian countries to reflect and reinforce their sustainability drive. It is time to explore a more resilient lifestyle based on sustainable technologies and practices. As the UN Secretary-General suggests, the post-pandemic recovery efforts need to respect the rights of future generations, enhancing climate action aiming at carbon neutrality by 2050 and protecting biodiversity. The United Nation Development Program (UNDP) emphasizes that “As we work through response and recovery from the shocks of the pandemic, the SDGs need to be designed into the DNA of global recovery” [7 ]. The South Asian countries should avail the ‘build back better’ opportunities presented by the pandemic to make a positive contribution to their energy and environmental outlook.     7 Conclusions The findings of the study reveal that overall, with regards to the studied SDGs, there is only marginal success. All countries face major or significant challenges with regards to SDG 6 as 68–84% of water resources in the region are contaminated. Achievement of SDG 7 is also an uphill task for all countries except the Maldives. In recent years, South Asian countries have made considerable progress on the energy front, especially with regards to the growth in power generation capacity and electrification of rural communities. However, over 350 million people still lack access to electricity and over 1 billion people have to use crude biomass fuels to satisfy their cooking and heat requirements. Achievement of SDG 11 also faces steep challenges for all countries as they face serious issues with regards to the sustainability of communities and cities. It is only SDG 12 and SDG 13 which have been achieved by most of the countries as there have been improvements with regards to life under water and life on land respectively. Energy security has a major role to play in improving not only SG 7 but a number of other SDGs as well, and this is an area where South Asia is struggling. South Asian countries are currently heavily dependent on energy imports and the consumption of fossil fuels to satisfy their needs. The region has rich potential for diverse renewable resources, especially in terms of hydropower, solar energy and wind power. These renewable resources can supply indigenous and environment-friendly energy. Vast hydropower potential at the rivers flowing from the Himalayan basin offers countries like Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan the opportunity to produce large-scale hydropower both through dam-based and run-of-river projects. While hydropower is already playing an important role in the power generation mix of these countries, the total hydropower potential in the region is estimated to be around 350 GW. The region has a healthy potential for solar and wind power. In terms of solar energy, it has a largely sunny climate with over 300 clear sky days and solar radiation in a range of 4 kWh/m2  to 6 kWh/m2 . Similarly, there is massive potential for wind power, especially along the coastal areas of India and Pakistan, the former having already installed over 37 GW of wind power projects. Energy cooperation between the regional countries can significantly help them overcome their challenges. The capacity of electricity transfer from India to Bangladesh, India to Nepal, and Bhutan to India is through projects of 600 MW, 330 MW, and 1,400 MW respectively. These initiatives, however, are capitalizing only on a fraction of the true energy trade potential in the region. The vast indigenous renewable energy resources offer a healthy and diverse resource base to help improve the energy and environmental security, and socio-economics of the region. Estimates suggest that by 2050, through measures like effective policy coordination, grid interconnection, market reforms, trade agreements, and regulation, SA countries have the potential to upscale the electricity trade up to over 70 GW of projects. To expedite the progress towards the achievement of SDGs, concentrated efforts are required especially in terms of governmental support, budget allocation, and robust policy formulation and implementation. In terms of limitations, this research faced difficulties in accessing data to develop a comprehensive and integrated outlook for the region as the availability of up-to-date data is an issue in some of South Asian countries. It is also observed that some of the achievements claimed by these countries in their national reports could not be independently verified. The acclaimed levels of rural electrification stated in Government reports and dashboards, for example, in some cases do not corroborate with the ground realities, creating ambiguity about the country reports. Future research can focus on a comparative study of South Asia with other developing regions like South East Asia, Latin America, and Sab-Saharan Africa to learn from mutual experiences, challenges, and success stories.
