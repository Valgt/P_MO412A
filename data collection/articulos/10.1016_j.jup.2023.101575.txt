                  This paper examines the water and sanitation procedures taken in refugee camps to provide inclusive services, preserve the environment, and design out waste, based on empirical data collected using a questionnaire distributed in Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon. Our study finds that refugees in Lebanon were the furthest left behind compared to refugees in Jordan and Iraq. Moreover, considering the culture of refugees, installing quality WASH services, and shifting from the traditional linear approach to the circular economy approach is an advantage in refugee camps that creates more resilience opportunities for refugees and their hosts. Without the concrete Partnership between governmental institutions, NGOs, and stakeholders, SDG6 and other related ones, including SDG3, SDG4 SDG5 and SDG8 will not be accomplished by 2030.

Table 5      Iraq Jordan Lebanon   The Strength points of WASH provision model - Iraq shift fast from the emergency phase to post-emergency standards by providing water service, private latrines, and showers at the household level WASH services were provided at an early stage in Domiz1 and immediately in Domiz2.  - The enabling environment and welcoming policy, mainly in partnership with the government facilitate the provision of WASH services at an early stage.    - The shift from a traditional approach to the circular economy and sustainable approach with the installation of water and wastewater networks, solar systems, and WWTP.  - The policy shift to provide the enabling environment and the facilitation and partnership between international organizations and government and the availability of funding assist the provision of sustainable WASH services.  - The population willingness to improve their living conditions. Despite the negative impact of installing private latrines, in the beginning, it drives the shift toward better services.    - The locations of some camps are in most cases close to the nearby host community, which makes it easier and lower cost to provide WASH services.     The weaknesses points of WASH provision model - Even though the WASH services were provided at an early stage, the management in the long term was not sustainable. The grey water is still discharged in open channels that expose people, especially, children to illnesses. and the operational cost is high and unsustainable. Moreover, there is no treatment of wastewater that goes to the natural resources. Yet, the last is in all the region not only the RCs.    - The location of the camp is isolated and the shift to sustainable response took more than 3 years, in which, the response led to tension with the host community and fear of the over-pumping and contamination of the aquifer in the second water-scarce country in the world.  - Ignoring the culture of refugee when installing WASH blocks for sanitation purposes, lead to people installing their private facilities, resulting in serious health risk and the possibility of an outbreak of water-borne diseases.    - The non-enabling environment and unwelcoming policy in addition to the economic crises led to an increase in the vulnerability of SRs.  - The current WASH services mainly depend on a private trucking model that is neither financially nor environmentally sustainable and underpins an unregulated informal water market.  - The unavailability of affordable portable water, resulting in people drinking non-portable water and water-borne diseases.  - The restriction on funding resulting in some refugees receive less that minimum standard even in emergency phase.  - The restriction on funding results in some refugees receiving less than the minimum standard even in the emergency phase.  - In some settlements, wastewater is discharged without any treatment into the neighboring watercourses resulting in an affecting the environment and natural resources.

Inadequate access to safe water and improved sanitation, insufficient hygiene practices, and inappropriate human waste disposal raise the risk of diarrhea-related morbidity and mortality (Mebrahtom et al., 2022 ; Nyoka et al., 2017 ; World Health Organization, 2014 ; Zakaria et al., 2015 ). According to the UN, more than 1300 children under five years old die every day from diseases caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation, and hygiene (UNICEF, 2022b ). While access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), including excreta disposal, is one of the most critical sectors in humanitarian work (European Commission, 2022 ; UNHCR, 2008 ), the situations in refugee camps (RCs) are challenging, especially with the rapid influx of refugees and limited sanitation options (Biran et al., 2012 ; Mahamud et al., 2011 ; Nyoka et al., 2017 ), where WASH services should be set rapidly. Lack of time and resources may lead site planners to use standard solutions instead of the ideal ones (Fenner et al., 2007 ). The public sector often has limited involvement during the emergency phase and its capacity stays inefficient. Moreover, there is an inadequate assessment of the enabling environment for alternative WASH services delivery models. These lead to considerable deficiencies in WASH sector implementation, management, and financing in RCs (Slekiene and Mosler, 2019 ). Access to water and sanitation is a human right recognized by the UN General Assembly (2010)  through resolution 64/292, and guaranteeing the accessibility and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all represent goal 6 of the 2030 agenda (UN, 2019 ) (Di Vaio et al., 2021 ; UN, 2019 ). The sustainable development goal (SDG) 6 has eight targets and eleven indicators.1  1 For more details about SDG6 targets and indicators, please see https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6 .   Targets define the goals and indicators illustrate the metrics by which the world seeks to track whether these targets are fulfilled (Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation - SDG Tracker, 2020 ). The last UNHCR (2020b)  WASH manual incorporate SDG6 to the provision of WASH services for refugees and encouraged national governments to integrate refugee WASH services into their national system and development planning fund as an opportunity to unlock more funds for the development of WASH services for refugees. Since SDG6 is for all, this means that refugee and other vulnerable groups should be included in the development plan of their host to achieve the 2030 agenda. However, planning for RCs in emergencies generally arises on an ad hoc basis, due to inadequate time to plan for environmental conservation measures. In scarce or not well-managed natural resources, it is important to consider the long-term implications of hosting an influx of refugees for an undetermined period, which has significantly increased the pressure on energy and water resources and caused an economic burden on these countries. The Sphere project and UNHCR WASH manual has defined WASH minimum standards in emergencies (Table 1  ) and adapted them according to different locations and cultural contexts. It indicates that the minimum average of water needs is 15 l/p/d, more than 50 people should not share latrines, and toilets should not be located more than 50 m from a household. Yet, various aspects control the provision of WASH service including physical limitations, funding, and the host country's conditions (Van der Helm et al., 2017 ). However, in post emergency and protracted phase, a refugee setting shifts from a ‘communal’ phase toward a ‘household’ phase. It is advisable to start directly with household facilities if the crisis tends to last for more than 6 months, (UNHCR., 2020a ). However, this does not seem applicable in the recently established camps. Guidelines for wastewater management and treatment processes during the post emergency and protracted phase suggest boreholes as a source of water, surface source and treatment, a pipe network, and a sewer network with desludging septage treatment (UNHCR., 2020a ). Yet, there is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness and efficacy of WASH systems for emergencies in low- and middle-income countries (Taylor et al., 2015 ; Yates et al., 2018 ). In an emergency, the most frequently chosen sanitation alternative has been the simplest ones, limited to onsite decentralized systems, with excavated latrines such as pit latrines or trench latrines being the very common option. However, they fail to exacerbate the problems that already exist in an emergency setting due to unstable soils, high water tables, flood-prone sites, lack of water, difficult ground composition or space constrain locations (Zakaria et al., 2015 ). Therefore, the provision of sanitation alternatives in camps requires thinking of innovative methods beyond the old-fashioned and challenging sanitation services (Johannessen et al., 2012 ; Zakaria et al., 2015 ). Many scholars studied water and sanitation services provision in RCs to achieve long-term and sustainable WASH services (Ahmed, 2016 ; Eggen, 2019 ; Muhammad Anwar et al., 2021 ; Nyoka et al., 2017 ; Tsesmelis et al., 2020 ; Van der Helm et al., 2017 ). The objectives of this study are to assess the status quo of the WASH sector in RCs in the Middle East in alignment with SDGs to inform policymakers, planners, and the international community of the progress toward the achievement of SDG6 of those RCs and to explore the extent to which the provided services fulfill the refugees needs. Moreover, it aims to form a better understanding of the issues related to the WASH services in RCs that can inform sustainable actions to achieve the commitment of leaving no one behind by 2030. The main questions that our study answers are: what is the reality of the WASH services provided in RCs in the Middle East countries bordering Syria and how refugees feel about it; what is the ranking of the selected countries toward achieving SDG6 in RCs? Moreover, some questions will be better clarified such as how does the WASH services affect the achievement of other SDGs; does the enabling environment of the host government impact the availability and quality of the WASH services; and what are the best practices toward providing sustainable WASH services in RCs? The paper contains seven sections. After this introduction, Section 2  explains the suggested methodology. Next, Section 3  describes the background and situation of the three case study countries and selected camps, and Section 4  provides the results of the questionnaire. Later, Section 5  discusses the results, and ultimately, Section 6  presents the conclusion, final remarks, and recommendations.  2 Methodology 2.1 Approach A comprehensive approach is followed in this study using data collected from a questionnaire (For more details about the questions and the results see the Appendix) and a literature review of the publicly available reports and studies. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected on refugees across the three selected case studies, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon. These case studies were chosen according to these criteria:1. Location: The three countries are neighbors to Syria and have the most SRs besides Turkey (Fig. 1  ). Moreover, they have a low-medium economy;  2. Time: The camps in the three countries were established in the same period and last up to now;  3. History: The three countries are Arab countries and have previous experience with refugees and displaced people;  4. Context: The water sector in the three countries faces a severe shortage and various challenges, including large-scale migration, rapid urbanization, and uncontrolled increase of the population. Moreover, from 1960 to 2010, the rivers' flow in the three countries declined between 50 and 90%, and the agriculture sector consumes the majority of water in the region (90%) (Blue Peace Middle East, n.d. ).    The collection of data was part of a more comprehensive questionnaire that was developed to examine the status quo of RCs related to different SDGs (Wardeh and Marques, 2023 ). However, this study focuses on SDG6 and the status quo of the WASH sector in the three countries.  2.2 Data collection In both Iraq and Jordan, the questionnaire was conducted online through social media contacts obtained through personal contacts and then using snowball sampling. In Lebanon, two associations working with Syrian refugees helped conduct it in person. The recommended sample size used was 97, for a 95% confidence level and 10% of error. 101 individual questionnaires were achieved. Table 2   shows the respondents' profile. The respondents are Syrian (78.2%) and Iraqi (21.8%). The questionnaire was conducted between October 2020 and March 2021. The respondents’ percentages were 45.5% in Iraq, 31.7% in Jordan, and 22.8% in Lebanon.  2.3 Data analysis and aggregation of the index The ‘IBM SPSS Statistics 25’ software was used to analyze the data. A Crosstabs analysis to disaggregate the answers on the country of residence. The normality test of the Likert scale question was done using Shapiro–Wilk test, and the result of the normality test was significant, meaning that the samples do not follow the normal distribution. Therefore, nonparametric tests were used to determine whether the answers among the groups were significant or not. The Index score indicates countries' progress toward achieving SDG 6 in RCs by the country's position between the worst and the best (0–100) and indicates where faster progress is needed. Only indicators that can be answered by people were considered when conducting the survey therefore, the final list included only two indicators (6.1.1) and (6.2.1) out of the eleventh SDG 6-related indicators (Table 3  ). The remains indicators were excluded because they are not directly related to refugees but rather to institutional and national levels. The min-max normalization method was applied for each indicator by converting it linearly to a scale of 0–100 (Sachs et al., 2018 ):x ´ = x  –  min ( x )   max ( x )   –  min ( x )        Where x is raw data value; max/min present the bounds for best/worst performance; and x, is the normalized value after the rescaling Equal weighting was used at the level of the indicators, and the same indicators were used for the three countries. Then, the index aggregation was carried out using the arithmetic mean of related indicators.   3 Case studies: different Arab state countries This section describes the background of the establishment of the camps in the three countries and the development history of water and sanitation services. 3.1 Iraq This study focuses on the Domiz refugee camp since most of the respondents were from it. Moreover, it has the most Syrian refugees in Iraq, and this makes the comparison with other countries more reliable. Domiz1 (GPS coordinates: 36.78232231, 42.89142378) was opened in April 2012. After that in December 2013, Domiz 2 (GPS coordinates: 36.76435 42.89603) was opened to respond to the continuous influx of refugees. It is located 5 km to the south of Domiz 1. Domiz 2 infrastructure was done in a reasonably planned manner compared to Domiz1 whose infrastructure was developed in a mixed manner and stages according to the different agencies, funding, priorities, and huge stress due to the large influx of refugees, as a result, the types, sizes, densities, quality vary across the camp. At first, in Domiz 1 each family was given a plot, with a tent and access to communal WASH facilities (latrines, showers, water taps …). Tankers trucked 440,000 L of water daily, but they did not meet the camp residents' needs due to the new arrival of Syrian refugees, which caused straining service delivery. The WASH situation changed in the beginning due to the movement of the population in and out of the camp. Later, the camp was replanned and each family was given an improved shelter. Each plot consists of a concrete slab and three rows of standardized bricks to reinforce the standard UNHCR tent, and brick-walled facilities, including a kitchen, bathroom, and toilet, while the communal facilities were dismantled. In Domiz 2 since the beginning, 1210 tents were provided with improved services (concrete slab and kitchen, family latrine, and shower) (UNHCR, 2014 ). Governmental institutions including the Department of Sewage contributed to the service provision and the connection to the main water supply and sewage networks. Water is distributed only 2 h per each second day through a network. Households who are not connected receive it through tankers. Water supply is provided through five boreholes (4 in Domiz1 and 1 in Domiz2) and three water reservoirs. Water is treated by chlorination only (Reckerzügl, 2017 ). In most Iraqi camps, the facilities have separate grey-black water systems. Grey water is discharged in open channels (which also collect the stormwater) to large natural drainage, then to Mosul Dam, which is a very important source of water, and partially to open fields around the camp. Black water is collected either to septic tanks or holding tanks per community (16 plots) and then emptied once they are full or overflowed (GIZ, 2021b ). This discharge is more complicated in wintertime due to the inflow and infiltration of surface and groundwater to the septic tanks, which cause more pressure on the trucks. The sludge is dumped 2 km away into the environment without any treatment at a designated dumping site. However, due to the pressure on trucks, the sludge is frequently dumped into an unofficial site near Domiz2. Yet, the study of GIZ. (2021a)  stated that both locations are the same since the sludge is dumped into nature and the catchment is part of the Mosul dam. Drinking water consumption within Domiz camp was between 75 and 78 l/p/d (87,660 m3 /month) (Shawkat Mizzouri et al., 2022 ). The average grey water produced was between 39 and 41 l/p/d (45,540 m3 /month), while the black wastewater was 11,900 m3 /month. The amount of grey water generated from the camps is high enough to be reused and decrease the pressure on freshwater sources (Shawkat Mizzouri et al., 2022 ). The study of Shawkat Mizzouri et al. (2022)  suggested building a waste stabilization pond (WSP) system in Domiz1. Domiz camp is being managed and operated by the Board of Relief and Humanitarian Affairs (BRHA). which was established by the Kurdistan Regional Government to handle the camp management in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. BRHA is funded by humanitarian agencies, including the UN and other NGOs. The management of the camp is run with the asset of various local government Directorates (GIZ, 2021a ; 2021b ). Water supply through network is free for refugees and no tariffs exist for both refugees and IDPs and the entire operation is subsidized by the goverment, humanitarian agencies and international donors. SRs are allowed to work in Iraq, yet the economic situation of displaced people is bad, and until now, there has been no capacity to manage the operation and maintenance expenses in the camps. This led to a lack of capacity to provide appropriate infrastructure.  3.2 Jordan Zaatari is the largest RC in Jordan. It is located in Mafraq, northern Jordan, close to the border with Syria (GPS coordinates 32.30246, 36.31945). By the end of 2022, it has 82,735 SR (UNHCR, 2022b ). NGOs and UN agencies started a series of WASH interventions, under the authority of the Government of Jordan, in Zaatari after its opening in 2012. First, around 4 million liters of water were trucked to serve the communal facilities in the camp using 300 tankers daily, and another 200 tankers were used to drive the wastewater out of the camp to the Al-Akeider Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is about 32 km far from Zaatari (Al Nimri, 2014 ; Ledwith, 2014 ; The Guardian, 2013 ; Van der Helm et al., 2017 ). This led to road damage and host community complaints, in addition to the fear of the over-pumping and contamination of the aquifer lying beneath Zaatari, which is an important source of water in Jordan, which is one of the most water-scarce countries worldwide (Ogata et al., 2022 ). After, three boreholes with a combined daily capacity of 3000 m3  were established to phase out the water trucking activities and deliver each refugee a minimum of 35–53 l/p/d (Alshawawreh et al., 2017 ). Then refugees started purchasing private water tanks to store water. In 2013, there were 61 water collection facilities with a rate of 162 persons per water collection facility and a total of 2340 public toilets with a rate of 51 persons per toilet were provided within 50–100 m walking distance. Few cases live more than 150 m from the nearest toilet and 400 WASH blocks for sanitation purposes -similar to those in Darfur refugee camp- but have not functioned as expected because women and children did not feel safe using them, especially at night (Farishta, 2014 ). Later, refugees installed their private facilities including water tanks and private latrines by time because it was not comfortable to use communal facilities, especially for women. This results in serious health risks due to the complexity of collecting fecal sludge from thousands of private pits and the possibility of an outbreak of water-borne diseases (Hietanen and Richard, 2014 ). Moreover, sanitation has affected the water network. The Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development indicated that the UNHCR applies similar strategies for camp planning regardless of the context and requirements of the population (Farishta, 2014 ). By 2015, the water network was piped to households. Zaatari was among the first camps in the world to have an on-site wastewater treatment plant with a daily treatment capacity of 3600m3  and reuse system, bioreactor membrane (BRM), and trickling filter, began operation with effluent quality acceptable to irrigate animal crops. In 2016, family-cluster wastewater tanks were connected to households with an expected life of a minimum of 15–20 years while the underlying cost-benefit study by UNICEF was positive after five years for both water and sanitation networks (Wardeh and Marques, 2021 ). An evaluation study indicated that the cost of providing water to refugees dropped from 3.34 Jod/m3  (USD 4.70) to 0.24 Jod/m3  (USD 0.34) between 2013 and 2016 (International Solutions Group & UNICEF Jordan, 2019 ). Without this initial cost-benefit study that indicated that quality WASH services are more sustainable with less operational expenditure; the actions taken by refugees to improve their living conditions by having private facilities; the partnership between the Government of Jordan and UNICEF; and the fund from donors including Germany that provided most of the required funds to UNICEF, Canada, UK and the US, this transition was not achievable. In the beginning, humanitarian agencies, including the UN and other NGOs, provided WASH services under the authority of the Government of Jordan. Now, the regulatory authority is the Ministry of Water and Irrigation and other entities within Jordan's government, while UNICEF is the funding source and determines the best modality to implement and deliver the WASH service. The water and wastewater network are run by local private contractors under the direction of UNICEF, while the Water Authority of Jordan runs the WWTP. The WASH software activities, like hygiene promotion, and community mobilization are run by UNICEF Jordan's partners, ACTED, Oxfam and ACF. The User's role is limited to day-to-day operation and maintenance at the household level such as minor repair work where they pay for the services of community-level plumbers to carry it out, besides protecting the WASH infrastructure from vandalism (Day et al., 2020 ). Water supply is free for refugees and there are no tariffs in the Zaatari camp. As a result, the entire operation is subsidized by UNICEF and its external donors (Day et al., 2020 ). At the beginning of the Syrian crisis, SRs were not allowed to work, so payment for water services would not be reasonable. After the Jordan compact in 2016, SRs got the right to work, in specific professions only, yet many constraints have remained, leading to a high percentage of refugees being unemployed, therefore, payment for water services would not be useful at this stage. However, it should be considered in the future if the RC lasts.  3.3 Lebanon Most of the refugees in Lebanon are in Bekaa Valley. More than 20% of them live in informal settlements that are located near the river courses in Bekaa and north Lebanon (see Aljarahieh settlement, Almarj, GPS coordinates 33.762319, 35.889769). At the end of 2016, there were 29,000 tents in Bekaa spread to 2650 informal settlements. These settlements used to have common facilities. However, currently, they get water from existing water networks, trucks, bottled water, private wells, springs or from boreholes newly drilled depending on their location. It is stored in tanks or underground reservoirs. Only a third of Syrian refugees get access to tap water for more than 2 h a day. The water used by these settlements differs between 50 and 90 l/p/d. (Kassem and Jaafar, 2020 ). However, according to United Nations (2022) , the amount of water supplied has been significantly reduced in some settlements to receive 7.5 l/p/d due to funding restrictions. Moreover, some people drink from non-portable water provided by humanitarian organizations for non-drinking purposes. In some of these settlements, each household has a toilet and shower within the dwelling connected to a wastewater network with a separation of greywater and blackwater. The greywater is pumped through the pipe network to a septic tank, and then to a soil infiltration trench for treatment, then the effluent is discharged into a nearby irrigation channel. While the blackwater is collected in a holding tank, repeatedly pumped out by a vacuum tanker, then transported to an off-site wastewater treatment plant, and this is a high-cost process (Eggen, 2019 ). After September 2022, the removing sewage was reduced from 17 l/p/d to 2 l/p/d. In other settlements, wastewater is discharged without any treatment into the neighboring watercourses (Kassem and Jaafar, 2020 ). The informal settlements have unofficial and non-permanent structures and usually are serviced by humanitarian organizations mainly UNICEF and its partners. The government of Lebanon does not officially provide WASH services to refugees in these settlements. The Lebanese WASH services are weak and struggle to provide a quality service for the population and to cover the operation and maintenance costs, especially after the economic breakdown. The Lebanese pound (LBP) had a progressive devaluation leading to a sharp decrease in the income and purchasing power in the country. The cost of the water supply has raised thirteen-fold from 2019 to 2022. The Tariffs are insufficient to close the gap between expenses and revenues. Yet, about 198,000 SRs in 2284 informal settlements have no choice but to buy water from private suppliers, mainly, the tracking sector, which is controlling the prices (UNICEF, 2022 ; United Nations, 2022 ). Moreover, the costs of trucked water have increased six-fold from 2019 to 2022. In 2016, the price of 1 m3  of trucked water cost LBP 9750 (USD 6.5/m3 ), which is almost more than fourteen times the price of water from the public network (USD 0.43/m3 ) in the Bekaa region (Ghanem et al., 2017 ). In 2022, the price of 1 m3  of water was around LBP145,000 (USD6/m3 ) (UNICEF, 2022 , 2022c ). The Lebanese monthly minimum wage remained the same at 675,000 LBP (USD 23) (United Nations, 2022 ). The cost of vacuuming wastewater is around USD202  2 This number is based on interview we made with SRs in Lebanon in 2022.   and could reach up to USD 50 (Sarah Matar, 2022 ). Taking into account that SRs are allowed to work in specific professions, yet the price they are charged for water services is unacceptable..   4 Results 90.9% of Iraq respondents and 77.4% of Jordan respondents reported that they have access to safe and affordable drinking water compared to 59.1% of Lebanon respondents (6.1.1) (see Table 4  ). People who said they do not have access safe and affordable drinking water explained that either the water they drink is not clean, it has a very strong test of chloride, or they cannot afford to buy clean drinking water, especially in the case of large families. Therefore, many families were drinking water provided by tankers by humanitarian organizations, which is unsafe to be drunk. 58.7% of Iraq respondents and 67.7% of Jordan respondents reported that they get their drinking water from the water network piped to the shelter, while 13.0% of Lebanon respondents reported the same. The same percentage (69.6%) reported having private water tanks filled by trucks paid for, either by them or by humanitarian organizations, compared to 29.1% and 41.3% in Jordan and Iraq. Yet 23,9%, 12.9% and 21.7% in Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon still using communal tanks and taps (see Fig. 2  ). Most respondents who do not have access to a network indicate that they spent less than 2 h daily to get their water needs (see Fig. 3  ). Half of the respondents in Lebanon reported spending on water, 50% out of those spend less than 10% of their monthly income, and 50% spend between 20 and 50%. Almost 19% of Iraq respondents reported spending on water, half of them spend less than 10% of their monthly income on water, a quarter between 10 and 20% and a quarter spend more than 75%. In Jordan, only 6% of respondents reported spending less than 15%, half of those spend less than 10%. 45% of Jordan respondents and 46% of Lebanon respondents reported that they had a disease caused by unsafe water or poor sanitation, compared to 33% of Iraq respondents. However, although diarrhea is a water-borne disease, 53% of Jordan respondents, and 69% of Lebanon respondents, compared to 86% of Iraq respondents reported suffering from diarrhea. 53.9% of Iraq respondents and 45.5% of Lebanon respondents reported that they had access to adequate and appropriate sanitation services, compared to 86.7% of Jordan respondents (6.2.1a). All Lebanon respondents reported they have access to hand washing facilities with soap and water, compared to 97.6% of Iraq respondents, and 93.3% of Jordan respondents (6.2.1 b) (see Table 4 ). 35% of Iraq and 50% of Lebanon respondents reported that they use pits connected to shelters that are regularly emptied. 81% of Jordan respondents reported that they have family-cluster wastewater storage tanks connected to the shelter. Most of the rest in the three countries did not know the kind of sanitation service they have. Wastewater was optimally treated in Jordan and the treated water was reused presenting a model of circular economy. However, the wastewater treatment in both Iraq and Lebanon is not sustainable and causes more pollution. The study of Eggen (2019)  showed that the on-site treatment in two refugee settlements in Lebanon was not optimal and the design of the infiltration system should be changed in order to safely discharge the greywater into the nearby irrigation channel. Fig. 4   shows the extent to which refugees feel safe and healthy protected by using the water and sanitation system they have using a seven-point Likert scale. The percentage of people having positive feelings in Jordan was a bit higher than those who have negative feelings, compared to an almost equivalent precentage in Iraq and higher negative feelings in Lebanon. Calculating the SDG6 index shows that Jordan followed by Iraq presents better progress toward achieving SDG6 with 85.7 and 80.8 compared to Lebanon with 68.2 out of 100. The differences between the countries are significant at 0.05 (see Table 4 ).  5 Discussion Although access to water was higher in Iraq than in Jordan (6.1.1), 9.5% of respondents in Iraq reported spending more than 10% of their monthly income on water compared to 3% in Jordan. While the situation in Lebanon was the worst with less access to water and 25% of respondents paying more than 10% of their monthly income on water. This means that the most vulnerable are spending the most on water. Furthermore, more than 60% of all samples spend more than 1 h to provide their families’ water needs, including 15% spend more than 5 h daily. This exposes concerns related to achieving both SDG4 (education) and SDG5 (gender equity) where in most cases women, girls and children are responsible for fetching water and thus reducing the time available for education and economic opportunities. Moreover, the approach used to provide communal facilities was not culturally appropriate, especially for women who reported feeling unsafe using those facilities. In addition, this has been linked to sexual harassment and gender-based violence in RCs (Sudan et al., 2021 ). Population participation and their inputs are vital to the success of any sanitation intervention because they improve user acceptability and offer opportunities to improve sanitation system designs based on specific requirements (Nyoka et al., 2017 ). The prevalence of diarrhea reported was high in the three locations, mainly in Iraq and Lebanon compared to Jordan, which showed a significantly lower percentage of diarrhea. Hossain et al. (2016)  reported the same in three countries, particularly among younger children 0–23 months. The high prevalence of diarrhea is directly linked to insufficient access to WASH facilities, hence, concerns related to health issues appear (SDG3). Yet, our results show that not all people considered diarrhea to be a water-borne disease. More people in the three countries reported having diarrhea compared to people who reported water-borne disease. This could be due to a lack of information, education and communication (IEC) provided to the refugee population. Although IEC materials could have been included in the hygiene kits distributed as reported by UNICEF in camps, either yet it lacks in the distribution, or the approach used to explain the information within these materials. Moreover, linked to IEC and harsh economic conditions, some households drink non-potable water. The results show that the majority of refugees do not feel safe and healthy protected by using the water and sanitation system they have, mainly in Lebanon followed by Iraq. Also, thinking about WASH services provided to the most vulnerable people including disabled and elderly people in RCs highlights the concerns of its inclusivity and achieving SDG10 (reduce inequality). Sudan et al. (2021)  reported that families with disabled or elderly members had poorer WASH access. After almost a decade of the Syrian crisis and the opening of refugee camps in bordering countries, 1 in 4 households of the total sample, mainly in Lebanon and Iraq have access to sanitation facilities that are pits connected to shelter, exposing the households to concerns related to WASH and health, especially in winter and when the pits are not regularly emptied (6.2.1. a). The provision of sanitation alternatives, technology, and innovation in sanitation services is needed in view of the complexity of the emergency (Johannessen et al., 2012 ; Zakaria et al., 2015 ) and the lack of funding in post emergency situations. Including dry or ecological toilet systems such as urine diversion toilets, composting toilets, or terra preta toilets. These do not require any water to operate safely, their treatment is simpler in case of the absence of treatment infrastructure, they can be used for a longer period, plus the reuse of their by-products. Urine, for instance, can be used for gardening as liquid fertilizer and feces can be used as a soil amendment or solid organic fertilizer after being dewatered (Eggen, 2019 ). The study of Patrick et al. (2021)  provided a piece of evidence on the acceptability of this technology among refugees in Ethiopia. Yet, it is recommended to examine it between various locations and among diverse cultural groups. Moreover, more careful operation and maintenance are required, and higher health risks are accompanied by excreta management. Table 5   shows the strength and weaknesses points of WASH services provided by country. The water provision system to refugees in general in the emergency and transitional phase or in the long term, like in Lebanon particularly, is not economically, socially, or environmentally sustainable. Providing water by tankers is not financially sustainable and encourages an unregulated informal water market. It has a negative implication on the environment and public health, moreover, on local and national resource management. (Ghanem et al., 2017 ) and it creates tension with the host community. The evolution of the water and wastewater system from trucking water to a water network and from unimproved pit latrines to a system of collective septic tanks, a wastewater network, and ultimately a wastewater treatment and reuse technologies in Jordan is a great jump from traditional unsustainable to sustainable approach and aligned with achieving SDG 6 and 3, 4, and 5. In addition, it affects the achievement of SDG 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, and 17. Because it saves time mainly for women and children; reduces water-related diseases; reduces water wastage; is cost-effective; generates cash for work in network construction; is better for the environment and allows the reuse of water (International Solutions Group & UNICEF Jordan, 2019 ; Wardeh and Marques, 2021 ). Promoting sustainable water and wastewater systems and circular economy in RCs instead of the linear traditional approaches such as water tankers and communal taps that have negative social, economic, and environmental consequences. As proved in the study of Muhammad Anwar et al. (2021) , the sanitation approach used first in Zaatari was unsustainable compared to the current long-term approach which is more environmentally friendly, more socio-eco-efficient and cost-efficient. Yet, the study proposed an effluent water reuse-based treatment and concluded that it increases economic efficiency by 75%, decreases environmental impacts by 57%, and increases social sustainability by 57% compared to the current approach applied in the camp. This shows that thinking of circularity would bring more social, environmental, and economic advantages compared to the traditional approach. Moreover, managing resources and long-term thinking are required even when we look at RC as a temporary settlement. The wastewater treatment in both Iraq and Lebanon is unsustainable. Both grey- and black-water should be treated on-site to achieve sustainability. Treated grey water can be reused on-site for gardening purpose, gardening, floor cleaning or laundry washing. Refugee settlements in both Iraq and Lebanon present higher access to drinking water (6.1.1) and sanitation (6.2.1a) compared to the country's nationals, while refugees in Jordan show a slightly lower one. Sudan et al. (2021)  reported that access to water and sanitation in RCs was comparable to that in urban households in host countries and in most of them refugees have higher access than nationals. This reflects the fact that the situation in the host country directly affects the situation of the refugees. The better the water management in the host country, the better the access to WASH services for refugees. Yet, it is advisable that using the inflows of international humanitarian funding as an opportunity to upgrade the existing water infrastructure and distribution networks to provide long-term benefits for both the refugees and their host community. The index of SDG 6, using the indicators (6.1.1) and (6.2.1) as mentioned earlier, Iraq and Jordan are more than three quarters ahead. This is clearly influenced by the existence of a sanitation network in the camp and by the fact that most respondents live in improved shelters and have access to better WASH services compared to those still living in tents. Yet, this gives an alert to the importance of accelerating progress and gathering the efforts toward achieving SDG 6 by 2030, and the promise of leaving no one behind. Furthermore, the index reflects how the enabling environment of the host country, including the policy, legal framework and regulation and governance structure related to refugees, impact directly WASH services availability and quality. Even though the role of humanitarian organizations and international partnerships is important to provide WASH services to refugees, the last decision is for host government. As it is clear in the case of Lebanon, where the government allowed neither the establishment of official camps nor the establishment of any permanent infrastructure in these settlements, unlike Iraqi government, which welcomed refugees and provided access to WASH services from the first stages and during the planning process. In Jordan, the planning process does not seem to have a long-term perspective for Zaatari. However, the refugee movement toward improving their living conditions and WASH services led the humanitarian organization to accelerate the progress toward providing long term and sustainable services. With the blessing of the Jordanian government and flow of international fund, Zaatari is an example of applying sustainability and circular economy to WASH services in RC. Site planners should prioritize sustainable solutions during the planning phase and should have knowledge of the variety of available sanitation technologies that can be applied for such emergencies. Moreover, taking affordability in emergencies seems to be not ideal in most cases. It is proven from the practices above, that unsustainable solutions have higher costs in the mid-and long-term combined with more burden on humanitarian organizations and host governments and leaving refugees behind.  6 Conclusions This research provides some of the first quantitative and qualitative evidence of WASH access in refugee camps/settlements, with a specific focus on SDG 6 and circular economy in refugee settings in different Middle East countries bordering Syria. We found that the interventions provided in the emergency phase are lifesaving. However, it is not sustainable, especially when turning to the long-term and protracted phase like the case of Lebanon, which is still using trucking model. The policy and enabling environment of host counties play an important role in the quality of WASH services that refugee has like the case of Iraq in the emergency phase where private latrine, water and wastewater network were established rapidly, and the case of Jordan in the protracted phase where they present a sustainable model that benefit both refugee and their host community. Developing integrated long-term solutions and applying a sustainable approach and circular economy from the emergency phase mainly when it is expected that the situation may last more than 6 months is crucial to improve future sustainability, water and sanitation accessibility, public health conditions, environmental conservation, and operational costs. Moreover, good governance is vital, considering the beneficiary preference and their culture to ensure that WASH interventions are acceptable and efficient. Further research investigating how existing WASH approaches can be improved in the context of sustainability and circular economy including the feasibility, outcomes and impacts of using technology and sustainable base interventions in the WASH sector in refugee camps compared to the traditional and commonly implemented ones is recommended. Although this study provides a comprehensive assessment of WASH services provided in RCs in the locations in which was conducted, the captured information is based primarily on data from individuals' responses from specific locations. It does not necessarily statistically represent the WASH situation of the entire refugee population, nor do they cover all countries. However, most of the issues raised throughout this study are indicative of the general targets linked to SDG 6, challenges and gaps in the current provision of WASH services in Syria's bordering countries. Based on the above discussion, we recommend:• Integrating refugees into the host national plans is vital more than ever when it is related to the 2030 agenda both Targets 6.1 and 6.2 should be segregated by refugees, migrants and other vulnerable groups to ease the monitoring and evaluation process and make sure no one is left behind;  • Promoting an enabling environment for refugees to be self-reliant and pursue a better life is a win-win situation for both refugees and their host. Refugee right to dignified work is important for the future sustainability of WASH services. Thinking beyond the humanitarian phase of the RC, WASH services should be handed over, delegated to a public or private service provider where implying tariffs that refugees can pay from their work guarantee the improvement and sustainability of the services;  • Transit from a traditional linear WASH provision system to a sustainable and circular economy model in RCs because it is an advantage for both refugees and the host, it reduces the operational costs over time and raises awareness between donors, decision-makers, host governments, and all involved parties about the efficiency and effectiveness of shifting from humanitarian assistance to development and applying sustainable solutions from planning phase to have a well-organized master plan;  • Partnership (SDG17) between different stakeholders including policymakers, humanitarian organizations, government and the private sector to promote sustainable WASH services. It would be useful to develop a sustainability partnership for emergencies at global and national levels with governments and water and sanitation authorities.
