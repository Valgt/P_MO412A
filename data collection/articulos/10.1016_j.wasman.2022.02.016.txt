                  Recently, the novel concept of the circular supply chain (CSC) has gained substantial attention amongst researchers across the globe. It is due to the issues of unsustainability in supply chain operation of manufacturing industry. CSC amalgamates the circular economy (CE) into the supply chain of manufacturing organizations. Business organizations can achieve several sustainable development goals by adopting CSC as an innovative strategy. However, limited attention has been given to its implementation in emerging economies. Thus, this research aim is to identify and analyze the essential CE practices that help to accomplish the several sustainable development goals (SDGs) of CSC management. This research presents an integrated framework of Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (PF-CODAS) techniques. PF-AHP is employed to determine the relative importance of CE practices, whereas PF-CODAS method ranks the SDGs derived due to the adoption of CE practices. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated with the help of an Indian manufacturing organization. The finding of this research reveals that practices based on 'government', 'management', and 'economy' initiatives play a significant role and contribute 50 % of its influence on the effective CSC adoption, whereas, 'mitigate waste and enhance environmental sustainability', is identified as the most critical SDG realized due to adoption of CE practices. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to check the robustness of proposed methods. This research provides the systematic, accurate, and valuable decision support tools to practitioners to execute the CE practices efficiently for achieving the various sustainability goals.

Graphical abstract       Recently, the novel concept of the circular supply chain (CSC) has gained substantial attention amongst researchers across the globe. It is due to the issues of unsustainability in supply chain operation of manufacturing industry. CSC amalgamates the circular economy (CE) into the supply chain of manufacturing organizations. Business organizations can achieve several sustainable development goals by adopting CSC as an innovative strategy. However, limited attention has been given to its implementation in emerging economies. Thus, this research aim is to identify and analyze the essential CE practices that help to accomplish the several sustainable development goals (SDGs) of CSC management. This research presents an integrated framework of Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean fuzzy combinative distance-based assessment (PF-CODAS) techniques. PF-AHP is employed to determine the relative importance of CE practices, whereas PF-CODAS method ranks the SDGs derived due to the adoption of CE practices. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated with the help of an Indian manufacturing organization. The finding of this research reveals that practices based on 'government', 'management', and 'economy' initiatives play a significant role and contribute 50 % of its influence on the effective CSC adoption, whereas, 'mitigate waste and enhance environmental sustainability', is identified as the most critical SDG realized due to adoption of CE practices. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to check the robustness of proposed methods. This research provides the systematic, accurate, and valuable decision support tools to practitioners to execute the CE practices efficiently for achieving the various sustainability goals.

The rapid growth of industrial activities causes the problems of waste generations (i.e., both solid and liquid waste), environmental pollution, scarceness of resources, and degradation of environmental conditions (Bressanelli et al., 2021; Turan, 2022; Turan, 2020 ). Hence, to deals with such unsustainable issues, the implementation of a sustainable strategy in the manufacturing supply chains is critical. Now a day, the circular supply chain (CSC) has received much more attention amongst the research community as one of the efficient strategies for enhancing organizational performance in three dimensions of sustainability (Farooque et al., 2019 ). CSC incorporates the principles of circular economy (CE) into the supply chain operation of manufacturing industries (Lahane et al., 2020 ). CSC acts as an alternative solution path to traditional supply chain, where a colossal amount of solid waste is generated along with the various supply chain operations (Lahane and Kant, 2021c; Turan, 2021; Tsai et al., 2021; Turan et al., 2018b; Turan, 2019; De Angelis et al., 2018; Turan et al., 2018a ). In contrast, CSC employs the value generation aspects of CE and keeps the products, materials, and components in the circular loop for a more extended period until the maximum value can obtain from it (Batista et al., 2018; Coenen et al., 2018 ). Thus, CSC is considered a waste management strategy for business organizations (Lahane and Kant, 2021b ). CSC utilizes the CE 6Rs principles in supply chain operations (Lahane and Kant, 2021a; Cesur et al., 2020 ). By adopting CSC, manufacturing organizations achieve social and economic efficiency, improve product design and competitiveness, reduce pollution, energy usage, resource scarceness, etc. (Lahane et al., 2021a ). In addition, a recent waste management initiative in saline wastewaters (brine) promotes the CE principles in the supply chain operation of several industries (e.g., desalination, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and textile). It helps to enhance the material, resource, and operational efficiency sustainably (Panagopoulos, 2021a; Panagopoulos, 2021b; Panagopoulos, 2021c ). Sepehri and Sarrafzadeh (2018)  studied nitrifying-enriched activated sludge (NAS) biomass as a solid waste that can be used to treat pollution. NAS approach lowers the fouling and enhances nitrification efficiency in a membrane bioreactor. Moreover, CSC also explores the diverse aspects of environmental sustainability such as design of circularity, industrial symbiosis, eco-industrial park, product service system, process integration, eco-innovation, life cycle assessment, products life cycle management, green economy, reverse logistics, green supply chain management, etc. (Merli et al., 2018 ). Therefore, CSC enhances organizational performance sustainably (Wu et al., 2018; Mangla et al., 2018 ). 1.1 Research motives The developed countries have well-established CSC networks for the last three decades (Dossa et al., 2020 ). These nations have stringent laws, regulations, and policies towards CSC adoption (Bressanelli et al., 2021 ). In contrast, developing countries, especially India, face implementation difficulties due to a lack of stringent laws and policies and a lack of knowledge and awareness about CE practices adoption (Lahane et al., 2021a ). In the Asian continent, India is one of the fastest burgeoning nations and the second most populated country globally. India generates a colossal amount of waste through unsustainable business practices (Batista et al., 2018 ). In addition, India placed fifth in the world for producing e-waste. Thus, India can obtain sustainable growth by adopting CSC as an innovative and sustainable strategy. The current practices adopted by India are not adequate to deal with the various concern of waste generation (Mangla et al., 2018 ). Thus, they need to adopt circularity features in the supply chain operations of industries. In previous studies, most of the work has been done on enablers, barriers, and drivers to CSC adoption in perspectives of Indian manufacturing sectors (Lahane and Kant, 2021c; Levering and Vos, 2019; Tura et al., 2019; Agyemang et al., 2019; Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018 ). However, researchers have given very little attention to CE practice adoption in supply chains of developing countries, especially in India. In addition, none of the literature focuses on sustainable development goals (SDGs) that can be derived from adopting CE practices in business organizations. However, few recently have done studies on CE practices adoption in perspectives of emerging nations (Saroha et al., 2021; Khan and Haleem, 2021 ). Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a numerical framework on CE practices that will help the decision-makers of industries attain the various sustainability goals.  1.2 Research objectives The following research objectives are formulated to develop a framework on CE practices to attain the several SDGs for manufacturing industries.i. To identify the significant CE practices and SDGs that can be derived from its adoption from emerging nations' perspectives.  ii. To evaluate the importance of identified CE practices for attaining the various SDGs of manufacturing industries for CSC implementation.  iii. To drawn considerable implications of this research.  iv. To perform the sensitivity analysis of the proposed framework.    Thus to accomplish the above objectives, this research identified the CE practices and SDGs derived from its implementation through a literature review and validated through experts inputs. Afterward, we have used suitable multi-criteria-decision-making (MCDM) techniques to prioritize the SDGs derived due to the implementation of CE practices. A sensitivity analysis has also been performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further, significant results are discussed with the decision-making (DM) panel experts to gain deep insights into this research.  1.3 Research contributions to the existing CSC literature This research attempts to make significant contributions to the existing literature on CSC adoption.i. First, this research provides a list of effective CE practices, and SDGs realized due to CE practices adoption in perspectives of developing economies, especially India. Such CE practices serve as an essential source that helps to achieve the several SDGs of industries by adopting CSC management in emerging economies.  ii. Secondly, the applicability of MCDM techniques in terms of the Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (PF-AHP) and Pythagorean combinative distance-based assessment (PF-CODAS) is contributing to the domain of CSC management. PF-AHP utilizes to determine the important weight of CE practices. In contrast, the PF-CODAS method prioritizes the SDGs derived due to CE practices adoption. Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS) theory effectively handles the uncertainty associated with human judgments in MCDM techniques.  iii. Thirdly, the proposed framework assists the managers / policy planners to develop stringent policies towards the effective adoption of CSC at the organizational level. Also, the ranking obtained in this research helps the managers to concentrate on high-ranked SDGs first compared to low-ranked SDGs for successful implementation of CSC.    The remaining paper is structured as follows: Section 2  presents the literature review relevant to this study. Section 3  presents the research methodology, which is followed by the research design in Section 4 . Section 5  offers the empirical case example. Section 6  summarizes the results and discussion. Section 7  draws substantial implications of the study, whereas Section 8  concludes the research with limitations and future scope.   2 Literature review This research explores the important CE practices that help to adopt CSC in developing economies. The literature considered in this review mainly focuses on CE practices and their implementation in the supply chain perspective, along with SDGs that can be derived due to its implementation. This research used the Scopus database for article search. The articles are searched within âtitles, abstracts, and keywordsâ. The following strings of keywords are used to identify the existing literature: âcircular economyâ, âcircular economy practicesâ, âcircular economy and sustainabilityâ, âcircular supply chain and practicesâ, âcircular supply chain and sustainable development goalsâ, âcircular economy and sustainable development goalsâ, âcircular economy and emerging economiesâ,. The identified articles are further scrutinized based on the following criteria:1. The only peer-reviewed journal articles written in English are selected, and the other articles from conference proceedings, book chapters, editorial notes, etc., are excluded.  2. The CE concept in the supply chain gained momentum from 2010 ((in terms of articles). Therefore, the time horizon for this research is taken from 2010 to December 2021.  3. The article's inclusion focuses on CE practices and their implementation in supply chain management.    Thus, the authors have collected the journal articles based on the above filter criteria. Further, the forward and backward snowball techniques (Lahane and Kant, 2021b ) are applied to obtain the most relevant articles for the review process. 2.1 CE practices for CSC implementation Manufacturing organizations across the globe are coming under the severe threats of unsustainable development (Lahane et al., 2020 ). It occurs because of various concerns such as climate change, global warming, fast urbanization, rise in population, increased demand for manufactured products, etc., (van Capelleveen et al., 2021 ). It is also caused due to resource scarceness, waste generation, and environmental degradation problems in the manufacturing sectors, especially in developing nations (Lahane et al., 2020 ). Hence, manufacturing organizations need to adopt sustainable production and consumption into their existing supply chain operation to deal with the above issues. The traditional pattern of the supply chain is based on the linear economy as it takes the raw materials for manufactured products and delivers them to the end consumers for use (Upadhyay et al., 2021 ). After their end-of-life phase, the consumers dispose of those products into a landfill. As a result, an enormous amount of waste is generated in the ecosystem. Thus, CSC is considered one of the most important strategies to manage these wastes effectively (Hussain and Malik, 2020 ). However, several CE practices need to be adopted efficiently to implement CSC management in a manufacturing industry successfully. Several authors have discussed the key CE practices for CSC adoption and implementation. Favi et al. (2017)  recommended that CE adoption is based on circular practices that efficiently use the available resources optimum and reduce redundant waste and carbon footprints across the industry's supply chain. Rehman Khan et al. (2021)  studied the importance of block chain technology in the perspectives of CE adoption. Block chain technology was found to be the most important driving factor for CE implementation. Elia et al. (2017)  developed the circularity index framework to monitor the various CE strategies and measure the circular performance of the industry. Corsini et al. (2017)  focused on extended producer responsibility for WEEE collection from households. This practice enhances the value recovery mechanism of CE. Cesur et al. (2020)  developed the decision model for sustainable consumption in remanufacturing opportunities of PVC products. The obtained results help the companies know the optimal remanufacturing times required for the remanufacturing process to get the utmost benefits of CE. Cui et al. (2021)  explored the CSC practices based on dual perspectives. They used a hybrid fuzzy Bayesian network and fuzzy Delphi method to assess the CSC practices. Their result reveals that the automated equipments, products service life extension using technological innovation, application of energy-saving technology, encourage consumers to return second-hand products after use, and motivating the people to purchase the recycled products are the top five significant practices for CSC implementation. Garrido-Hidalgo et al. (2020)  adopted the internet of things in CSC management for the value recovery of WEEE products. The authors discuss the lithium-ion electric vehicle battery packs system as a case example of CE in this study. Gusmerotti et al. (2019)  performed a cluster analysis to confirm their current degree of circular practice implementation in Italian firms. Tseng et al. (2021)  analyzed CSC collaboration attributed using DEMATEL and ANP techniques and developed the numerical framework in the Vietnamese healthcare industry based on resource and organizational change management theories. Coenen et al. (2018)  reviewed the literature on complexity, challenges, and uncertainty associated with closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) implementation. CLSC was found to be an essential component of CSC for obtaining sustainability in various supply chain operations. Masi et al. (2018)  recognized the various circular practices for CSC implementation through the survey methodology. Lahane and Kant (2021a)  evaluated solutions to mitigate the CSC adoption risks. Financial sourcing and constraints risk was found to be the most critical risk in CSC implementation. Further, same authors Lahane and Kant (2021b)  ranked the performance outcomes derived due to CSC enablers' implementation in developing economies. Dossa et al. (2020)  examined the role of CE practices in the UK wheat food supply chain using a case study approach. Their study results show that economic deliberation is the foremost factor driving CE implementation. Dubey et al. (2019)  developed the framework to assess the impact of exterior pressures on supplier relationship management practices for the CE. Kazancoglu et al. (2020)  examined the hindrances of CSC implementation in the context of the textile industry from the stakeholders' perspective using the fuzzy DEMATEL method. Their result shows that insufficient technical knowledge and obstacles in product design are the most influencing and influenced practices of CSC implementation. Rehman et al. (2016)  examined organizational performance in the context of green practice adoption. Nikolaou and Tsagarakis (2021)  reviewed the critical issues of CE in perspectives of industrial symbiosis and industrial ecology. Okorie et al. (2021)  examined the product cannibalization and remanufacturing aspects of CE based on sustainability's triple bottom line action. In their study, they explore the challenges, interactions, and relationship between product cannibalization, remanufacturing, and the six dimensions of CE.  2.2 SDGS derived due to adoption of CE practices Due to globalization, most of the manufacturing industries across the globe face various issues of unsustainability, which directly affect the overall performance of an organization (Yadav et al., 2020 ). Thus, CE practices adoption in business supply chains helps improve sustainability in three different dimensions (Saroha et al., 2020 ). A total of 17 SDGs were designed by the United Nations Department of Global Communications in 2015. It is designed to be a blueprint for achieving a better and more sustainable future for all. The total 17 SDGs are like no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation, and infrastructure, reducing inequality, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water, life on land, peace, justice, and strong institutions, partnerships for the goals (Schroeder et al., 2019 ). SDGs help to improve the green and circular image of the manufacturing organizations and consequently optimize the performance and efficiency of supply chain operations. However, CE adoption in industrial supply chains directly and strongly contributes to 12 out of 17 SDGs (Schroeder et al., 2019 ). These are secondary market proximity, promote the good health and well being, sustainable production and consumption, industrial innovation and infrastructure for circularity action, material and resource effectiveness, employment opportunities, restorative / regenerative aspects of circularity, economic efficiency and operational performance, climate change and resilience, stakeholder association, industrial symbiosis, mitigate waste and enhance environmental sustainability. Very few of the authors have discussed the significance of CE practices towards the SDGs. Schroeder et al. (2019)  identified the relevant CE practices for implementing several SDGs. Corona et al. (2019)  assessed the role of circularity metrics towards sustainable development through the CE. Karuppiah et al. (2021)  discussed the hurdles for CE practices adoption in the leather industry and provided several implications for SDGs in emerging economies. Gupta et al. (2021)  developed the integrated framework of Industry 4.0, cleaner production, and CE to evaluate manufacturing organizations' ethical and sustainable performance. In this study, authors have utilized the best-worst and combined compromise solution methodological approach for assessing sustainable performance. Belmonte-UreÃ±a et al. (2021)  contributed to SDGs research on CE, degrowth, and green growth. Chen et al. (2020)  discussed the challenges and perspectives of adopting green chemistry principles in the CE system towards SDGs. Rodriguez-Anton et al. (2019)  analyzed the relations among the CE and SDGs using the correlation matrix method. Dantas et al. (2021)  interlinked the role of CE and industry 4.0 towards achieving the SDGs. D'amato et al. (2019)  recommended that CE acts as a key driver towards sustainable and innovative development of society and businesses. It also helps to achieve several SDGs through strategies connecting CE and supply chains.  2.3 Research gaps Since the last three decades, European countries have efficiently implemented CSC into their business environment; however, the developing nations are still facing the problem of its implementation. The subsequent research gaps are recognized based on existing literature of CSC management.i. Most of the researchers have focused on drivers, enablers, indicators, benefits, barriers, and challenges to CSC adoption (Lahane et al., 2021b; Urbinati et al., 2021; Lahane and Kant, 2021c; Khandelwal and Barua, 2020; Kazancoglu et al., 2020; Agyemang et al., 2019; Mangla et al., 2018; Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018 ). However, very little attention has been given to the literature on CE practices and SDGs that can be derived from its implementation in the context of CSC management.  ii. Determining the intensity of influence of identified CE practices on achieving the SDGs is extremely important for success of CSC implementation (Schroeder et al., 2019 ).  iii. However, very few articles could calculate the intensity of identified CE practices by adopting any decision-making techniques (Saroha et al., 2021 ; Khan and Haleem, 2021 ).  iv. There are several CSC frameworks available in existing CSC literature (van Capelleveen et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2021; Saroha et al., 2020 ). However, none of the research has been performed on a framework facilitating the CE practices for managing the several SDGs of industries in the context of developing economies.  v. The majority of the verified frameworks adopted case study and survey-based approaches as their verification mode (Kazancoglu et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2020; Garza-Reyes et al., 2019 ). A very few of them used the decision-making support tools to fortify their effectiveness (Yadav et al., 2020; Khandelwal and Barua, 2020 ).  vi. In most of the previous studies, authors have ignored the uncertainty and vagueness associated with human judgments. This research ruled out such ambiguity by using PFS theory with the selected methodologies. Also, this is the first kind of study that utilizes the PFS theory in decision-making for assessing CE practices for attaining the SDGs derived due to its adoption.    The above research gaps justify the objectives set for this research work.   3 Methods The detail about the solution methodology adopted has been explained in this section. 3.1 Pythagorean fuzzy sets The usually input data associated with decision-making problems carries imprecision and vagueness. Such ambiguity in input information is effectively handled by Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) (Lahane and Kant, 2021a ). These fuzzy sets are generally represented in three different functions: membership, non-membership, and hesitancy degree function. However, in some situations where the value of these membership functions is greater than one, IFSs cannot deals the ambiguity. There are three more extensions available to IFSs that can deal with these issues of uncertainty. It includes a Neu-trosophic set, PFS, and Orthopair fuzzy set (Lahane and Kant, 2021b ). The present study utilizes the PFS to handle the imprecision associated with the subjective opinion of humans in the decision-making environment. In PFS, the summation of the membership and non-membership degrees can be greater than 1, but the sum of squares of them cannot. It means that every point (x, y) of intuitionistic membership grades are come under the lineÂ ÃÂ Â +Â yÂ â¤Â 1, whereas, the all the point of Pythagorean membership grades are with x2Â +Â y2Â â¤Â 1. This indicates that, set available for Pythagorean membership grades is larger than set available for intuitionistic membership grades. Fig. 1   illustrates the comparison of space of Pythagorean and Intuitionistic membership grades. Thus, PFS offers large degree of freedom to the decision makers to express their opinions about vague and imprecise information in MCDM problems (Ilbahar et al., 2018 ). Lately, the PFS has been used in several research fields such as risks evaluation in CSC implementation (Lahane and Kant, 2021a ); risks analysis in information security (Ak and Gul, 2019 ); landfill site selection (Karasan et al., 2019 ); hydroelectric power plant risks assement (Yucesan and Kahraman, 2019 ); occupational health and safety (Ilbahar et al., 2018 ); gas pipeline project (Oz et al., 2019 ); etc. The mathematical preliminaries of PFS are presented in Appendix A .  3.2 Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process AHP is extensively employed method to answer the multifaceted MCDM problems. It acts as the most effective  and potent MCDM technique to compute the criteria weights (Lahane and Kant, 2021a ). However, the application of AHP has some limitations such as it is generally used in a crisp decision-making environment. AHP cannot manage imprecision and vagueness present in MCDM problems (Lahane and Kant, 2021a ). The ranking obtained in AHP is also imprecise due to biases in expertsâ opinions. Hence, this study employs the AHP technique with PFS. PF-AHP offers several key benefits, like it can capture the uncertainty and imprecision in human judgments of experts by handling linguistic variables (Lahane and Kant, 2021b ). Thus, lately, PF-AHP has been used in several research areas such as green supplier selection in the Industry 4.0 era (ÃalÄ±k, 2021 ); evaluation of enablers to CSC management (Lahane and Kant, 2021b ); ranking the solutions to mitigate the CSC risks (Lahane and Kant, 2021a ); analysis of risks in self-driving vehicles (Bakioglu and Atahan, 2021 ), etc. The following steps of PF-AHP are adopted from Lahane and Kant (2021a) . Step 1:  Construct compromised pairwise comparison matrix A = a ik      m Ã m      based on linguistic scale (Please see in Appendix B ). Step 2:  Calculate the difference matrices D = d ik      m Ã m      using Eqs. (1) and (2) :(1) d ik  L   = Î¼ ik  L   2  - v ik  U   2      (2) d ik  U   = Î¼ ik  U   2  - v ik  L   2       Step 3:  Compute the interval multiplicative matrix S = s ik      m Ã m      using Eqs. (3) and (4) :(3) S ik  L   = 1000  d ik  L          (4) S ik  U   = 1000  d ik  L           Step 4:  Calculate determinacy value Ï = Ï ik      m Ã m      using Eq. (5) :(5) Ï ik   = 1 - Î¼ ik  U   2  - Î¼ ik  L   2     - ( v ik  U   2  - v ik  L   2  )       Step 5:  Multiply the indeterminacy degrees with S = s ik      m Ã m      matrix to find the matrix of unnormalized weights T = t ik      m Ã m      using Eq. (6) :(6) t ik   = ( S ik  L   + S ik  U    2  )  Ï ik        Step 6:  Determine normalized priority weight w  i     using Eq. (7) :(7) w i  = â k = 1  m  t ik    â i = 1  m  â k = 1  m  t ik           3.3 Pythagorean fuzzy combinative distance based assessment The combinative distance based assessment (CODAS) is considered a fruitful MCDM method to solve multifaceted problems involving conflicting criteria. Ghorabaee et al. (2016)  developed the CODAS method, and it is based on a crisp set or ordinal information to assess the given alternatives. The result obtained in the proposed method is reliable and consistent about criteria weight change. Hence, the CODAS can give optimum and stable results in comparison with other MCDM methods. Afterward, the same authors have extended this method with PFS and named as PF-CODAS. In this method, the desirability of an alternative is determined by using Euclidean distance as the primary and the Taxicab distance (Hamming distance) as the secondary measure. However, it is based on assumption that Euclidean distances are incomparable and these measures are calculated according to negative ideal point (Ghorabaee et al., 2016 ). The alternatives which are having the greatest distance are more desirable in the PF-CODAS method. Recently, few of the authors have applied this method to assess financial strategies (Zhou et al., 2020 ) and supplier selection in the manufacturing environment (Bolturk, 2018 ). The steps of PF-CODAS are as follows: Step 1:  Develop the initial decision matrix D = ( D ij   )  m Ã n   = ( i = 1 , 2  , . . m ; j = 1 , 2  , . . n )     with the help of PF-CODAS scale (Please see in Appendix C ). Step 2:  Develop the Pythagorean fuzzy decision matrix from initial decision matrix using Eq. (8) :(8) X   = x   ij       n Ã m   = x   11   â¯  x   1 m     â®   â±  â®   x   n 1     â¯  x   nm               Where, x   ij   â¥ 0    and x   ij   = ( Î¼ P  , Ï P  )     and 0 â¤ ( Î¼ P  ( x )  )  2    + ( Ï P  ( x )  )  2  â¤ 1 .    Step 3:  Calculate the Pythagorean fuzzy normalized matrix using linear normalization using Eq. (9) :(9) r   ij   = x   ij   max  i  x   ij      if j â N b    min  i  x   ij    x   ij     if j â N c             Where, Nb  and Nc  represent the sets of benefit and cost criteria, respectively. Step 4:  Calculate the Pythagorean fuzzy weighted normalized matrix using Eq. (10) :(10) u   ij   = w   j  r   ij        Where, w j  0 < w j  < 1       denotes the weight of jth  criterion and â j = 1  m  w j  = 1   . Step 5:  Determine the Pythagorean fuzzy negative ideal solution using Eq. (11)  and Eq. (12) :(11) ns    = [ ns    j  ]  1 Ã m       (12) ns    j  = min  i  u   ij       Step 6:  Calculate the Pythagorean fuzzy Euclidean and Taxicab distances of alternatives from the negative ideal solution using Eq. (13)  and Eq. (14) :(13) E i  = â j = 1  m  ( u   ij   - ns    j  )  2        (14) T i  = â j = 1  m  u   ij   - ns    j         Step 7:  Construct the relative assessment matrix based on the Pythagorean fuzzy Euclidean and Taxicab distances using Eq. (15)  and Eq. (16) :(15) R a  = [ h ik   ]  n Ã n       (16) h ik   = E i  - E k     + ( Ï E i  - E k     Ã T i  - T k     )       Where, k â { 1 , 2  , â¯ , n }    and Ï denotes a threshold function to recognize the equality of the Euclidean distances of two alternatives as given in Eq. (17) :(17) Ï x    = 1  if x    â¥ Ï   0  if x    < Ï           Step 8:  Calculate the assessment score of each alternative using Eq. (18) :(18) H i  = â k = 1  n  h ik       Step 9:  Rank the alternatives based on assessment score (Hi ).   4 Research design The integrated framework of AHP and CODAS technique with PFS is introduced in this section. This framework comprises of three phases. Fig. 2   illustrates the research design of the proposed research framework. Phase I: Recognize the most common CE practices, and SDGs realized due to CE practice adoption. Phase II: Determine the relative importance of CE practices using PF-AHP. Phase III: Rank the SDGs realized due to CE practice adoption using PF-CODAS.  5 Case analysis and data collection 5.1 Back ground of case organization The effectiveness of the proposed research framework is confirmed by taking a case example of the Indian manufacturing industry. The selected case organization is named XYZ organization, and it was established in 1996. It has over 10,000 employees and an annual turnover of 49 US Dollars. It is located in the Maharashtra state of India and manufactures various auto-based components such as two-wheeler fairings, seat and side covers, luggage boxes, helmets, and headlight housings, etc. They use different molding techniques by processing plastic resins such as GPPS HIPS, PP, ABS, HDPE, and LDPE. Manufacturing safe, environmental concern and user-friendly products is the organization's prime aim but fails to balance sustainability's three dimensions. Besides, the organizations face several challenges regarding managing generated wastes across the supply chain processes. The existing supply chain does not have an in-built waste product recovery facility. Thus, this organization desires to adopt a sustainable strategy for managing these wastes so that generated wastes are converted into valuable resources. Consequently, it reduces waste, pollution, and dependency on the input resources required. The executives of the present organization are well attentive towards CSC implementation. Hence, the selected case organization managers are interested in assessing the CE practices and SDGs derived due to its adoption for CSC management. Because of this, the present research framework employs the PF-AHP and PF-CODAS methods to evaluate and rank the SDGs derived due to the adoption of CE practices. It would help the practitioners to recognize the significant CE practices and their impacts on CSC implementation.  5.2 Phase I: Recognize the most common CE practices and SDGs realized due to CE practice adoption First of all, 48 CE practices and 17 SDGs were listed based on literature analysis. Thereafter, the questionnaire form was prepared to illustrate the list of CE practices and SDGs. It is then given to the experts of the DM group of the case company for validation. The DM group comprises five experts: Head (manufacturing), Head (production), and each manager from safety, operational, and logistics departments. Selected experts are specialized in plastic manufacturing and its recycling-related activities and have more than 10 years of industrial experience. The selected experts are highly skilled and have expertise in the field of CSC management. Upon discussion, 32 CE practices were initially selected. Further, they have added 03 additional practices widening the total to 35 practices and classified it into 07 main practices. A total of 12 SDGs were selected from the presented list. The details about the selected 35 CE practices and 12 SDGs were illustrated in Tables 1 and 2   , respectively.  5.3 Phase II: Determine the relative importance of CE practices using PF-AHP PF-AHP is employed to compute the weight of CE practices and their sub-practices. Initially, the pairwise comparison matrices of CE practices and their sub-practices are filled by experts of the DM panel in terms of linguistic variables and provided in Appendix B . Thereafter, a single decision matrix is computed based on a pairwise comparison of respective matrices. The steps given in Section 3.2  were utilized for further computations. Appendix B shows the detailed calculations sheet of PF-AHP for data obtained from expert 1. The final global weight for each CE practice is given in Table 3  . The management initiatives based practices (MIBPs) has obtained the maximum weight among all CE practices.  5.4 Phase III: Rank the SDGs realized due to CE practice adoption using PF-CODAS The weights obtained in PF-AHP are used in PF-CODAS technique. In this phase, SDGs derived due to adoption of CE practices are ranked in PF-CODAS method. Initially, the questionnaire form is given to the expert of DM panel. The final decision matrix is computed according to importance of SDGs with respect to CE practices. The steps mentioned in Section 3.3  were used for further calculations. The appendix C  shows the detail calculations sheet of PF-AHP for data obtained from expert 1. The final ranking of SDGs due to CE practices implementation based on Ki  value is revealed in Table 4  .   6 Results and discussion The identification of CE practices is primarily important for the success of CSC implementation. This research intended to prioritize the SDGs that can be derived due to adoption of CE practices. The total 12 SDGs were ranked against the 35 CE practices. Based on result analysis, management initiative practices (MIPs) are identified as the highly weighted and most important practices among all selected sets of practices. The major practices are ranked based on their relative weight obtained are as management initiative practices (MIPs)Â >Â government initiative practices (GIPs)Â >Â economy based practices (EBPs)Â >Â technology and infrastructure practices (TIPs)Â >Â product design practices (PDPs)Â >Â cleaner production practices (CPPs)Â >Â social and cultural practices (SCPs). It is also observed that nearly 50 % of CE practices from the management, government, and economy base have a significant influence on CSC implementation. The sub-practices from MIPs category are ranked based on their priority is MIP1Â >Â MIP5Â >Â MIP4Â >Â MIP3Â >Â MIP2Â >Â MIP6. The managerial support and commitment towards CE in supply chain perspectives (MIP1) is the most crucial practice amongst all the MIPs for CSC implementation. The transformation of the business from linear to circular mode is not an easy task for any organization. They need to have strong top management support and commitment from the company. Saroha et al. (2022)  suggested that adopting the circularity concept in manufacturing sectors needs strong support from top executives of organizations. CSC adoption provides long-term benefits and helps improve the circular / green image of the company to a greater extent. The training and awareness program for supply chain members about CE practice (MIP 5) is ranked second in the list. Training and awareness programme plays a significant role in upgrading supply chain members' skills towards circularity related operations in manufacturing organizations (Khan and Haleem, 2021 ). Training and awareness programme emphasized on getting supply chain members acquainted with the various CE principles such as reuse, recycling, remanufacturing, refurbishment, reduce, redesign, repair, etc. (Karuppiah et al., 2021 ). It helps to gain the knowledge about different circular business models and their associated designs. Furthermore, such programme aids the supply chain members to improve the products environmental footprint based on life cycle perspectives (Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018 ). Government initiative practices (GIPs) positioned second in priority of major category and their sub-practices are prioritized: GIP1Â >Â GIP4Â >Â GIP2Â >Â GIP3Â >Â GIP5. The stringent laws, legislation, and policies towards CE in the supply chain (GIP1) are ranked the most vital practice. In India, strict laws, regulations, and policies are absent for managing waste products and their by-products. Ansari et al. (2019)  reported that the products manufactured in emerging nations do not have strong support from governments in terms of subsidies, grants, incentives, and rebates to adopt CSC. In addition, restraining laws in concern to import of end of used/secondary products in the Indian perspective are the foremost issues in front of manufactures to set with CSC activities (Rehman et al., 2016 ). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and formulate laws and policies that can help manage the CE adoption in supply chain operations of industry. Economy-based practices (EBPs) ranked third in the list of major practices. Their sub-practices are ranked are as EBP2Â >Â EBP1Â >Â EBP4Â >Â EBP3. The decouple economy in the supply chain with environmental impacts (EBP2) is the most crucial practice. CSC adoption decouples the economy by utilizing the available resources in an optimum manner. It also decouples sustainability's socio-economy and environmental aspects using CE 6R principles (Moktadir et al., 2018 ). Tura et al. (2019)  suggested that manufacturing organizations must design the supply chain network in such way that it can decouple the economic growth through the circularization of multiple value chains in entire regions with a triple bottom line approach. Thus, adoption of CE in supply chain helps to improve the sustainability aspects of business organizations. Technology and infrastructure practices (TIPs) placed at fourth rank in priority and their sub-practices are ranked are as TIP1Â >Â TIP4Â >Â TIP5Â >Â TIP3Â >Â TIP2. The adoption of innovative and green technology in a manufacturing supply chain helps to enhance the circularity aspects of CE faster and more efficiently (Masi et al., 2018 ). The advanced technologies such as Block chain, Internet of things (IoT), and cyber physical system are likely to form the basis of CE digital infrastructure (Rehman Khan et al., 2021 ). Thus, CE digital infrastructure helps reduce burdens and provides support for various CE operations. Product design practices (PDPs) occupies at fifth-ranked in priority and its sub-practices are as PDP1Â >Â PDP4Â >Â PDP3Â >Â PDP2. Khandelwal and Barua (2020)  mentioned that several business organizations in developing countries are adopting circularity design principle in the initial stage of products development because it helps to support the various CE operations for value recovery purpose. Thus, practices based on product design are crucial for effective CSC adoption. Cleaner production practices (CPPs) and social and cultural practices (SCPs) placed at 6th and 7th spot respectively in the major CE practices. The ranking of CPPs sub-practices are as CPP2Â >Â CPP1Â >Â CPP6Â >Â CPP4Â >Â CPP3Â >Â CPP5. The ranking of the sub-practices of SCPs are SCP2Â >Â SCP1Â >Â SCP3Â >Â SCP5Â >Â SCP4. Saroha et al. (2020)  mentioned that CSC adoption helps to improve the supply chain operational efficiency by implementing cleaner production practices. The adoption of CE in supply chain conserves the raw materials, energy and water; eliminate toxic and harmful raw materials, reducing the emissions, and wastes across various production processes. Mangla et al. (2018)  recommended that CSC implementation generates the huge employment opportunities and helps to change the negative attitude of customers towards purchasing of end of used/second hand products. The higher the assessment score better is the alternatives. The assessment score ( H  i  )     for mitigating waste and enhancing environmental sustainability (SDG12) is the highest while promoting good health and well-being (SDG2) is the lowest. The SDGs are ranked based on decreasing values of assessment score are as SDG12Â >Â SDG7Â >Â SDG5Â >Â SDG8Â >Â SDG3Â >Â SDG11Â >Â SDG4Â >Â SDG9Â >Â SDG1Â >Â SDG6Â >Â SDG10Â >Â SDG2. The ranking of SDGs helps industrial practitioners to attain sustainability in different operations of supply chains. The various dimensions of sustainability can be achieved by effective CE practice adoption. CSC upscales the CE 6Rs principles for new products by using second-hand products at a very reasonable cost (Tura et al., 2019 ). Thus, CSC adoption helps to enhance the various social aspects of sustainability (Salim et al., 2019 ). It also helps to increase the market shares for recycled / remanufactured products. CSC implementation also reduces the negative influence of products on the eco-system and solves the various issues of environmental unsustainability such as resource scarceness, waste generation, and environmental degradations (Khan and Haleem, 2021 ). Gusmerotti et al. (2019)  suggested that CE activities directly contribute towards diverse sustainable development goals by reducing overconsumption, design-out waste and restore and regenerate ecosystems and natural capital. Therefore, the circular image of the manufacturing sectors is greatly improved by adopting CSC management.  7 Managerial implications This section presents research contributions to scholars, academicians, and practitioners, followed by recommendations to the policymakers. Further, the sensitivity analysis of proposed methods is presented in the following sections: 7.1 Contribution for researchers and industrial practitioners The present study contributes to CE / CSC domain in the following ways:i. The several concerns of unsustainable development in the manufacturing environment have appealed to academicians and industrialists to identify and examine the important CE practices that could help manage CSC implementation in a manufacturing sector.  ii. The previous study lacks the concrete decision-making framework relevant to CE practices and their impact on achieving the SDGs. The outcomes of this research framework could help the practitioners to adopt CSC effectively and successfully.  iii. This research evaluates the 35 CE practices that are categorized into 7 main criteria (Practices). It is a wide-ranging and first research which combines the CE practices and SDGs in the CSC research area. A clear understanding of each CE practice and SDG helps the managers to implement CSC fruitfully.  iv. It is challenging to adopt all the CE practices simultaneously in a manufacturing industry. Thus, ranked obtained in PF-AHP assists managers in concentrating on top-ranked CE practice first and so on for effective CSC implementation  v. The prioritization of SDGs realized due to CE practice adoption using PF-CODAS aids the managers to build the strategic model in the initial stage itself. It will enhance the success rate and minimize the failure rate of CSC implementation.  vi. The adoption of CSC in developing economies is at a nascent stage. The applicability of the proposed framework is performed in an Indian case organization. The same framework with few modifications will help the practitioners of other geological locations to enhance their sustainable performance.  vii. The various risk associated with the CSC adoption in an industry is greatly reduced due to the effectiveness of proposed research framework. It also assists in improving the negative mindset of consumers towards purchasing second-hand / end of used products.  viii. Research framework facilitates the case and other industries to implement CSC as a long-term strategy for sustainability with cost-effective benefits and high returns to society.  ix. CSC implementation helps boost India's various missions, such as Clean India and Green India. These missions form a crucial part of CSC that spotlights on waste management of products, byproducts, and components.  x. Clean India mission aims to keep the environment clean and pollution-free. This mission is also known as the Clean Bharat mission of India. The Green India mission is to defend the environment and focus on conserving natural resources by adopting CE 6Rs principles. Therefore, this study offers a vital roadmap to those eager to implement CSC into their business environment.     7.2 Recommendations for policy planners Nowadays, the CSC concept has received much attention from stakeholders because it is considered a dominant alternative to the traditional supply chain model. CSC acts as a waste management strategy. Thus, government institutions should come forward and develop stringent laws, regulations, and policies for CSC adoption. In addition, these institutions should also develop and formulate favored subsidies and tax policies for circularity implementation. The government institutions should impose the laws and regulations for managing the unceremonious wastes for value recovery purposes. Hence, such an initiative boosts the other industries' interest in CSC adoption. The authorities from government institutions can utilize the final ranking obtained in this research to formulate a constructive strategic action plan favoring the stakeholders to improve the nation's economy.  7.3 Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis test is generally performed to check the robustness of the proposed framework (Lahane and Kant, 2021a ). It ranks the SDGs (alternatives) with the change of criteria (CE practices) weights. A total of 20 experiments have been performed in this test. Details about it are given in Appendix D . In the first eighteen experiments, each CE practice's weight is set higher one by one by keeping the weights of other CE practices as low or assigned equal weights. The weight of CE practice (GIP1) is allocated as 0.6, and the weight of remaining CE practices (GIP2-SCP5) is assumed to be equal (i.e., 0.01176). Then the prioritization of SDGs is computed. Similarly, the weight of other CE practices has been modified for further calculations. The change in the ranking of SDGs (alternatives) as the weights of CE practices are changed is illustrated in Fig. 3  . From this result, it has been seen that the SDG12 has obtained the highest and second-highest assessment score (Hi) in twelve experiments (i.e., experiments number 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20) out of 20 experiments and reported as the best SDG that can be achieved due to CE practice adoption.   8 Conclusions In recent times, the business environment's manufacturing activities have caused various concerns of unsustainable development that can directly affect the performance of the ecosystem and negatively impact society. Therefore, industries need to adopt innovative and sustainable strategies to deal with such issues. CSC is one such strategy that is based on value gain aspects of CE. It is considered an alternative solution to the traditional supply chain model. CSC keeps the materials, components, and products in a closed-loop even after its end of life phase for value gain. As a result, it minimizes the generation of waste across the ecosystem, reduces the material input required for manufacturing, and improves environmental sustainability in business organizations. The present study proposes recognizing and assessing the CE practices and the SDGs realized due to their adoption. The literature review and experts input were used to finalize the 35 CE practices and 12 SDGs. The empirical framework has been developed using hybrid PF-AHP, and PF-CODAS approaches to rank the SDGs due to CE practice implementation. In the beginning, the PF-AHP method was employed to find the main and sub-criteria weight of CE practices. The result reveals that management initiative practices are the most critical among all leading CE practices. It is followed by government initiative practices, economy-based practices, technology and infrastructure practices, product design practices, cleaner production practices, and social and cultural practices. Almost 50 % of the practices from the management initiative, government initiative, and economy-based practices significantly impact the adoption of CSC management. Further, the weights obtained in PF-AHP have been utilized in PF-CODAS technique for ranking the SDGs (alternatives) realized due to CE practices adoption. SDGs were ranked based on assessment score Hi. From the obtained result, the assessment score Hi is highest for SDG12 (i.e., mitigate waste and enhance environmental sustainability) in all SDGs. SDG 2 (i.e., promote good health and well-being) is the lowest-ranked SDG among all SDGs. The SDGs were ranked in the first five: restorative/regenerative aspects of circularity, material and resource effectiveness, economic efficiency and operational performance, and sustainable production and consumption. Furthermore, secondary market proximity, employment opportunities, and stakeholder association are among the low-ranked SDGs in priority. Even if the low ranked SDGs are also evenly significant for the business organizations. The prioritization of SDGs aids the practitioners in adopting the CE practices systematically. Consequently, the circular performance of organizations has been improved. Further, to authenticate the proposed framework, the sensitivity analysis was performed. 8.1 Limitations and future directions This research has a few limitations that can provide opportunities to other researchers to investigate the issues. The computational procedure in the proposed framework is based on the subjective opinion of experts. Any biasing in the experts' opinion will persuade the final result. Hence, it is expected that the result should be computed with intense care. The single case organization of India has been considered in this study to measure the effectiveness of the proposed research framework. Thus, the proposed framework with some amendments can be extended to other geological locations to generalize results. Moreover, in future studies, the obtained result can compare with other decision-making techniques such as a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija i Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), Complex proportional assessment (COPRAS), Combined compromised solution (CoCoSo), Elimination et choice translating reality (ELECTRE), etc. under Pythagorean fuzzy environments.
