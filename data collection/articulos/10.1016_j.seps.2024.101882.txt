                  Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in developing economies, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), has become a focal point of discussion. This study contributes to this discourse by investigating the effects of international capital flows on SDGs in SSA, with a specific focus on the moderating mechanisms that influence these effects. Using data from 41 SSA countries spanning 2000 to 2018, the findings emphasize the crucial role of governance quality and ICT diffusion as effective factors moderating the nexus between international capital flows and SDGs. The study reveals a nuanced impact of international capital flows on sustainable development, encompassing both positive and negative effects across economic, social, and environmental dimensions. However, the presence of good governance practices and widespread diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) serves as crucial conditional factors, enhancing the positive effects of international capital flows on economic and social sustainability while simultaneously mitigating their potential adverse effects on environmental sustainability. Through improvements in governance structures and the promotion of ICT diffusion, policymakers can create an environment conductive to maximizing the benefits of international capital flows while minimizing their adverse repercussions, thereby fostering sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa.

Department of Business Administration College of Business and Economics Qassim University Saudi Arabia       Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in developing economies, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), has become a focal point of discussion. This study contributes to this discourse by investigating the effects of international capital flows on SDGs in SSA, with a specific focus on the moderating mechanisms that influence these effects. Using data from 41 SSA countries spanning 2000 to 2018, the findings emphasize the crucial role of governance quality and ICT diffusion as effective factors moderating the nexus between international capital flows and SDGs. The study reveals a nuanced impact of international capital flows on sustainable development, encompassing both positive and negative effects across economic, social, and environmental dimensions. However, the presence of good governance practices and widespread diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) serves as crucial conditional factors, enhancing the positive effects of international capital flows on economic and social sustainability while simultaneously mitigating their potential adverse effects on environmental sustainability. Through improvements in governance structures and the promotion of ICT diffusion, policymakers can create an environment conductive to maximizing the benefits of international capital flows while minimizing their adverse repercussions, thereby fostering sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa.

The report raised concerns about the depletion of non-renewable resources, the diminishing availability of arable land, and the challenges associated with managing pollutants. It served as a wake-up call, highlighting the need for a more sustainable approach to development (Meadows et al., 1972). Nearly two decades later, the concept of sustainable development was formally introduced in the Brundtland Report of 1987, titled "Our Common Future." This influential report emphasized the importance of preserving resources for both present and future generations. It promoted a development model that addresses the needs of the present generation while safeguarding the ability of future generations to fulfill their own needs [1 ]. Sustainable development has indeed gained significant attention as a crucial societal concern since its emergence in the early 1980s. The growing recognition of the need to address global challenges and strive for a more sustainable future led to the United Nations (UN) convening nations to collectively tackle these issues. To guide global efforts towards sustainability, the United Nations introduced the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals, established in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, encompass a wide range of objectives aimed at addressing current and future sustainability challenges. These goals encompass a wide range of objectives aimed at eradicating poverty, promoting gender equality, ensuring access to clean water and sanitation, combating climate change, fostering sustainable economic growth, reducing inequalities, and promoting responsible consumption and production, among others. Since the establishment of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, political authorities have indeed faced the challenge of achieving sustainable development, particularly in developing countries where it remains an elusive goal [2 ]. The successful implementation of the sustainable development agenda indeed requires substantial funding that often exceeds the capacity of domestic resources. As a result, the role of foreign financial resources has been extensively discussed in the financial literature as a means to bridge the gaps in domestic resources and savings, enhance management capabilities, alleviate foreign exchange shortages, and improve the balance of payments in developing countries (Aliyu, 2005). In this context, international capital flows, including remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI), have been acknowledged as significant contributors to promoting sustainable development. The role of these capital flows was recognized at the Third UN International Conference on Financing for Development, where they were international capital flows were identified as potential sources of financing for the SDGs, highlighting their importance as complementary resources to national development efforts. Indeed, several researchers have emphasized the significance of international capital flows in achieving economic goals ([3 ]; Ratha, 2003; Le, 2011; Makiela & Ouattara, 2018; Saidi et al., 2020; Francois et al., 2022) as well as social goals (Gohou & Soumaré, 2012 [4 ]; Dhahri & Omri, 2020a; Dhahri and Omri, 2020b; Chiappini et al., 2022). However, it is important to note that these international flows can also pose a threat to the environment due to their potential to generate pollution and degrade the environment (Shahbaz et al., 2015; Ahmad et al., 2019; Essandoh et al., 2020; Omri and Belhadj, 2020; Ahmad et al., 2022). The potential conflict between socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability, which is generated by international capital flows, can indeed be an obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in parallel. This issue represents a central concern raised by many scientists who warn about the environmental degradation caused by socioeconomic activities (Ripple et al., 2017; Bradshaw et al., 2021). There is indeed a gap in the existing literature regarding the impact of international capital flows on sustainable development in its three dimensions. Limited knowledge exists regarding the conditions under which these flows contribute to achieving economic and social progress while ensuring environmental sustainability. The diffusion ICTs have been cited as a key driver for the attractiveness of international capital flows, which, in turn, contribute to the achievement of some of the SDGs ([5 ]; Kurniawati, 2020; [2 ,6 ]). Recognizing the potential of ICTs, the UN advises developing countries to leverage ICTs in various sectors, such as healthcare, transportation, public agencies, education, services, and small businesses. The UN believes that ICTs have the capacity to generate income, improve living standards, reduce unemployment, enhance productivity, lower transaction costs, promote investment, and contribute to knowledge creation [7 ]. In addition to ICTs, several scholars argued that good governance has the potential to influence the attractiveness of international capital flows by promotion of political trust, involvement in the political system, and emphasis on democratic institutions (Nord, 1990; Kurul & Yalta, 2017 [8 ]; Abbas et al., 2017). Similarly, enhancing governance structure has the potential to reduce transaction costs and facilitate the inflows of remittances through formal channels (Effiong and Asuquo, 2017). While most previous studies show the effectiveness of governance quality and ICT diffusion in the attractiveness of international capital flows, there are still gaps in prior research regarding the modulation effects of these two conditional variables on the relationship between international capital flows and both economic, social, and environmental sustainability. By addressing this gap, the current study aims to examine the direct and indirect impacts of international capital flows on achieving the SDGs across 41 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries from 2000 to 2018. This research offers several distinct contributions compared to previous research. First, in addition to the direct effects, it examines the indirect impacts of international capital flows on achieving all 17 SDGs. Specifically, it investigates the moderating role of governance quality and the diffusion of ICTs in shaping the relationship between international capital flows and SDGs. By considering both direct and indirect effects of international capital flows and incorporating governance quality and ICT diffusion as moderating variables, this study provides fresh insights into the intricate dynamics between international capital flows and SDG attainment. Secondly, the study constructs three sustainability indices, corresponding to economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability, and three governance indices, capturing political, economic, and institutional governance. Second, we built three sustainability indices based on the theoretical classification of the 17 SDGs proposed by Costanza et al. (2016). These indices correspond to the three major dimensions of sustainability: economic sustainability (including SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12), environmental sustainability (including SDGs 6, 13, 14, and 15), and social sustainability (including SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 16, and 17). We also built three governance indices based on the work of Kaufman &Karay (2011), which capture political, economic, and institutional governance. Three indices related to ICT diffusion (ICT access, ICT use, and ICT skills) are also constructed to measure the level of ICT adoption. Third, it extends prior literature by calculating and discussing the Governance and ICTs thresholds under which the overall net negative effects of international capital flows become positive on SDGs. Finally, in terms of results, the findings show that the presence of good governance structures and widespread diffusion of ICTs serves as crucial conditional factors in explaining the relationship between international capital flows and SDGs, strengthening the positive impact of international capital flows on the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development, while simultaneously mitigating their potential adverse effects on environmental sustainability.

FDI has a crucial role in advancing a nation's position on the global stage, providing not only financial resources but also technological skills (Diaconu, 2014). Multinational firms bring in valuable management expertise, entrepreneurial capabilities, and know-how, which are shared with local businesses through a process of "learning by doing," ultimately improving overall productivity (Chuang, 1998; Li &Tanna, 2019). The 2002 United Nations Development Conference emphasized the significance of FDI in financing long-term economic growth. FDI has the unique ability to contribute to poverty reduction by fostering economic growth and development, facilitating knowledge and technology transfer, generating employment opportunities, fostering competitiveness and entrepreneurship, and enhancing overall productivity (United Nations, 2002, p. 5). Remittances also play a crucial role as a key source of external finance for developing countries [9 ]. These financial transfers contribute to increased domestic consumption, thereby stimulating economic growth. Stable remittance inflows also enhance the balance of payments by reducing current account deficits, alleviating external debt burdens, and minimizing the savings-investment gap within the economy ([10 ,11 ]. International trade experts and development economists agree that FDI is critical to the domestic entrepreneurial activities of host economies as well as their overall economic development. FDI provides crucial financing and is expected to greatly assist host nations. These advantages stem from the transmission of expertise and spreading of technological advancements to domestic enterprises. This transmission of skills occurs via the shifting of labor between international and indigenous companies, as well as the development of formal and informal linkages between foreign and local corporations. Additionally, domestic entrepreneurs are able to study and learn from both the triumphs and setbacks experienced by foreign businesses operating within the country [12 ]. Findlay (1978) posits that FDI contributes to technological advancement in the host country through the dissemination of advanced technologies and managerial techniques employed by foreign companies, known as the spillover effect. Numerous empirical research, such as those of Alfaro et al. (2004), Omri and Sassi-Tmar, (2025), Saidi et al. (2020), and Demir and Lee (2022), contributed to understanding of FDI's role in economic development. These scholars assert that FDI serves as a vital conduit for technology transfer, which, in turn, fosters economic growth, and the effects of FDI on economic growth are contingent upon various factors, including human capital, the capacity to absorb technology, and the development of financial markets, among others. The authors recommend that host countries enhance local conditions to attract FDI flows, as better local conditions not only attract foreign firms, but also allow local countries to maximize the benefits of foreign investment. Despite its economic effects, FDI has also been cited as one of the drivers of social development, particularly through local skills development, job creation, and the stimulation of technological progress (Gohou and Soumaré, 2012). Several researchers have demonstrated the social benefits resulting from inflows of FDI. For instance, Gohou and Soumaré (2012) investigated the nexus between FDI and welfare in Africa, confirming a positive correlation between net FDI flows and poverty reduction. However, they found that FDI has a greater influence on welfare in the poorest countries compared to the richest countries. Wang et al [13 ] examined the potential of FDI to improve regional energy performance. The results show that improving the quality of FDI can have a positive impact on regional energy efficiency, through the development of renewable energies, the optimization of industrial structure and the improvement of innovation capacity. They also suggest that, with reduced local economic pressure and increased fiscal decentralization, the role of FDI quality in promoting energy efficiency could be greater. However, despite the numerous advantages it brings, FDI has been found to be one of the drivers of environmental degradation, particularly in developing nations (Mabey & McNally, 1999; Kivyiro & Arminen, 2014). The linkage between FDI and its environmental impact can be examined through two prominent theories: the pollution halo and haven hypotheses. The first hypothesis suggests that multinational corporations, equipped with advanced technologies and managerial expertise, operate in host countries with stringent environmental regulations (Dean, 1992; Zarsky, 1999). According to this theory, FDI should not only be driven by economic growth considerations but also align with the environmental protection standards of the host countries. On the other hand, the second hypothesis posits that the liberalization of developing countries' economies to international trade and FDI inflows may result in increased pollution or greenhouse gas emissions in these nations (Copeland, 2005). This theory suggests that multinational corporations may exploit lax environmental standards in developing countries to minimize compliance costs and take advantage of natural resources without adequate environmental safeguards. Empirically, several studies indicated that there is a negative linkage between environmental sustainability and FDI (Gray, 2002; Perkins & Neumayer, 2008; Omri et al., 2014; [14–16 ]). Their findings show that (i) FDI enables multinational companies in developed countries to transfer polluting units to developing countries where environmental standards are less stringent, in order to reduce their implementation costs; (ii) FDI leads to increased carbon emissions in host countries due to the use of obsolete and environmentally unfriendly technologies; and (iii) FDI can lead to environmental degradation by stimulating industrialization through increased production, depletion of natural resources, and demand for fossil fuels. The authors suggest the need for strict environmental regulations to ensure that FDI does not harm the environment in the region. It is therefore essential to strictly enforce environmental policies or enact new policies to ensure environmental quality. More recently, Fang et al. [17 ] revealed that stable FDI can effectively reduce urban carbon emissions, particularly in cities with low industrial rationalization, high dependence on foreign capital and resource-based industries. Meanwhile, Boateng et al. [18 ] examined how institutional quality moderates the relationship between FDI and environmental quality and their results highlighted the importance of improving regulation for FDI to have a positive impact on the environment, particularly in low- and high-income countries. Remittances are the largest source of external financing for developing economies after FDI (Ratha, 2003; Giuliano & Ruiz-Arranz, 2009). They are also considered one of the determinants of sustainable development across its three dimensions. From an economic perspective, Leon-Ledesma and Piracha (2004) found that remittances improve productivity and employment in transition economies. They promote economic growth in countries with less developed financial systems, alleviating credit constraints, encouraging investment, and thus promoting economic growth (Giuliano & Ruiz-Arranz, 2009). In the same direction, Rao &Hassan (2009) analyzed the direct impacts of remittances on economic development and the mechanisms through which remittances affect economic development. The authors find no significant direct effects of remittances on economic development for 40 countries. However, remittances can boost economic growth through various conditions. Indeed, financial development is the most frequently used conditioning factor in the interaction terms between remittances and economic growth. In addition to their economic effects, remittances can also lead to social progress by reducing poverty [19 ,20 ], alleviating budget constraints and improve consumption patterns (Stark, 1995; Taylor et al., 2003); increasing savings and investment, empowering the households that receive them (Cox &Jimenez, 1992; Yang, 2008); providing insurance for economic shocks and emergencies (Poirine, 1997; Gubert, 2002); and augment the knowledge and education needed to enhance the human capital and health of families who remain in their home countries (Stark, 1991). Furthermore, universal access to energy in developing countries is essential to achieve sustainable economic growth and social well-being. Recently, Barkat et al. [21 ] analyzed the effects of remittances on energy poverty in 109 developing countries between 2000 and 2019, and their results indicated that remittances can be used effectively to reduce energy poverty in low- and middle-income countries. Subramaniam et al. [22 ] also confirmed this conclusion, highlighting the need to promote greater remittances, which will reduce poverty levels, promote access to energy and contribute to energy security. Remittances appear to contribute to reducing poverty and enhancing well-being. However, their increase could be linked to an increase in environmental degradation, as indicated by research (Brown et al., 2020). Remittances can potentially influence environmental degradation through two channels (Khan et al., 2020). First, remittances contribute to household income, leading to an increase in aggregate consumption expenditures and industrial production. This increased consumer spending prompts producers to build more industrial units to meet domestic demand, resulting in a higher use of fossil fuels and subsequently increased carbon emissions. Therefore, the increase in remittances can contribute to environmental degradation. Second, the increase in savings resulting from higher remittances allows households to deposit excess money in financial institutions. These deposits are then used by financial institutions to create credit and generate profit through interest rates. Manufacturers, in turn, borrow money from the banking sector to expand their businesses or build new factories. This increased borrowing leads to a higher use of fossil fuels and, consequently, increased carbon emissions. Many empirical studies, such as Ahmad et al. (2019) Yang et al. (2021), Ahmad et al. (2022), confirmed the negative impacts of international remittances on environmental quality. More recently, Zhang & Zhao [23 ] suggested that remittances contribute positively to environmental quality by reducing carbon emissions in BRIC countries over the period 1990–2020. In contrast, Yadou et al [24 ] investigated the effect of remittances on environmental quality, measured by the ecological footprint in 30 African countries between 2000 and 2021. Their results indicate that remittances contribute to environmental degradation by increasing the ecological footprint. Considering these previous studies, it is clear that FDI and remittances positively contribute to the economic and social sustainability, whereas their contribution on environmental sustainability is negative. Therefore, we formulate the following hypotheses.H1a International capital flows increase economic sustainability.  H1b International capital flows enhance social sustainability.  H1c International capital flows deteriorate environmental sustainability.    2.2 Role of governance quality Good governance reduces transaction costs, which are a key factor in calculating investment returns and are considered by foreign firms contemplating investing abroad. In this framework, effectiveness refers to the capacity to minimize transaction costs, which are primarily production costs, logistical operations and information on how to do business, as well as risk monitoring. The existence of these costs can be attributed to inadequately safeguarded property rights, the absence of a well-regulated institutional framework, prevalent corruption, underdeveloped financial markets, or insufficiently motivating incentive systems (Dunning, 2004). Similarly, Dunning and Lundan (2008) argued that institutions are an important component of host-country specific location, as they are directly associated with the transaction costs and asset benefits that influence FDI decisions. Nord (1990) argued that an inefficient institution increases transaction costs, provides bad information, and reduces benefits. In contrast, a good institution positively affects economic activities and foreign investment. In addition to cost and benefit effects, institutions establish the framework and parameters within which social transactions occur, while also influencing the conduct and encounters of the individuals participating in these transactions (Scott, 1995). Good governance that promotes property rights and the rule of law can improve economic prospects and attract foreign investors. In contrast, poor institutional quality can hinder FDI inflows because it poses a risk to investment. Hence, nations contemplating the attraction of greater foreign investment must establish a conducive institutional framework characterized by political stability, market efficiency, and safeguarded property rights [25 ]. Mengistu and Adhikary [26 ] conducted a study focusing on 15 Asian economies from 1996 to 2007 to examine the impact of good governance on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. Their findings indicate that political stability, government effectiveness, rule of law, and control of corruption are the most significant factors influencing FDI among the six indicators of good governance analyzed. The authors argue that countries that enhance their overall governance environment are more likely to attract greater FDI, even if they have certain deficiencies in other dimensions of good governance such as voice and accountability, and regulatory quality. Moreover, Asamoah et al. [8 ] studied the relationship between macro-economic uncertainty, FDI, and institutional quality for 44 SSA countries between 1996 and 2011. Their results show that increased economic uncertainty among SSA economies is a deterrent to attracting FDI in most countries in the sub-region. However, in many economies in SSA, having good institutions plays a crucial role in attracting FDI. Additionally, the authors propose that strong institutions can mitigate the adverse impact of economic uncertainty on FDI. To enhance FDI inflows, the authors suggest that countries should prioritize improving the quality of their institutions. By establishing effective institutions, corruption can be reduced, and the proper functioning of courts and the rule of law can be ensured. This, in turn, will create an appealing environment for conducting business and attract the necessary FDI for fostering economic growth in the region. More recently, Bhujabal et al [27 ] examined the impact of institutional quality on FDI flows in South and Southeast Asia between 2002 and 2019, and they found that an ideal governance system, characterized by low corruption, political stability, absence of violence, voice and accountability, regulatory quality and an adequate judicial system, contributes positively to FDI flows. In addition to its role in attracting FDI, good governance has been also recognized as a key determinant of remittance inflows. The quality of governance can theoretically influence transaction costs, and improving institutional quality has the potential to reduce these costs and facilitate the flow of remittances through formal channels (Effiong and Asuquo, 2017). Government institutions play a crucial role in shaping the incentive structure that governs social, economic, and political interactions within an economy. By reducing uncertainty and promoting efficiency, these institutions can lower transaction costs and encourage the flow of remittances (Catrinescu et al., 2009). Recent studies have examined the empirical relationship between governance and remittances, providing further insights into this topic. For instance, Lartey and Mengova (2016) studied the role of institutions in delivering remittances to developing countries and found that improvements in the functioning of government institutions led to increased inflows of remittances. They identified sound monetary policy and efficient government as key factors contributing to economic freedom, suggesting that migrants are more likely to send remittances to countries with favorable macroeconomic environments. Similarly, Abbas et al. (2017) used the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to analyze the effects of political factors on remittances in Pakistan from 1972 to 2012. Their study demonstrated that democracy encourages migrants to send more remittances to their home country. Previous studies have shown that international capital flows have both positive and negative effects on economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Additionally, these studies have highlighted the importance of good governance as a key determinant of these capital flows. Therefore, it can be assumed that good governance plays a crucial role in shaping the impact of international capital flows on sustainable development. Specifically, good governance can act as a conditional factor that strengthens the positive effects of capital flows on economic and social sustainability, while also mitigating their potential adverse effects on environmental sustainability. Therefore, we formulate the following hypothesis.H2 Governance quality modulates the effects of international capital flows on the economic, social and environmental SDGs.    2.3 Role of ICT diffusion In endogenous growth theory, technology diffusion plays a crucial role in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. This process involves the spread of technology and knowledge from one country to another, leading to economic growth and development. The impact of technology diffusion on FDI inflows can be understood through five dimensions (Fujimori et al., 2021), namely global best practices in innovation, strong competition, labor mobility, backward and forward integrations, exports, and intellectual capital development. By promoting these factors, host countries create an environment that encourages foreign investors to choose their investment destinations and facilitates innovation for new market entrants (Olokoyo & Omozokpia, 2021). An improved ICT infrastructure can help attract foreign investors for many reasons, such as enabling better communication between the subsidiary and the parent company, reducing transportation costs, and improving the availability of information (DeMello, 1999; Hejazi & Safarian, 1999). Indeed, economies that have successfully implemented ICT create new opportunities to increase the profitability of investments by foreign investors. For example, a developed ICT environment promotes more cost-effective, efficient, and transparent management of company and country risk profiles. This allows investors to determine the true value of companies and the potential return on their investment in an economy. Additionally, ICTs play a crucial role in bridging rural and remote areas by facilitating access to vital information and other services essential for business development. In a study conducted by Addison and Heshmati (2004) that examined the drivers of FDI across a panel of countries, their findings highlight the stimulating effect of ICT on FDI flows into developing countries. This stimulation is attributed to the reduction in transaction and production costs for foreign investors and improved access to information regarding investment opportunities in less developed economies. ICT and digital technology have also the potential to transform the landscape of international remittances. By leveraging digital platforms and mobile technology, remittance senders and recipients can benefit from improved access, reduced costs, and increased financial inclusion (Munyegera and Matsumoto, 2016). It also lowers transaction costs of remittances by facilitating online money transfer services. This makes formal remittance channels more affordable and accessible compared to traditional physical locations (Gascon et al., 2023). Mobile fund transfer services have emerged as a solution for migrants to send remittances to their home countries. These services address challenges such as underdeveloped banking sectors, high costs of bank transfers, and reliance on informal methods. They provide a convenient and secure alternative for migrants to send money back home (David et al., 2013). Mobile banking has also been recognized as an innovative solution in financial services, with the potential to bridge the gap in access to financial services and drive socio-economic improvements (Kshetri and Acharya, 2012). More recently, Gascóna et al. [28 ] highlighted the pivotal role of ICT in improving remittances in the case of El Salvador. The study emphasizes how the digitization of banking operations has introduced a new level of flexibility, reducing the reliance on physical bank branches. While previous studies have primarily focused on the direct effects of ICT and international capital flows on sustainable development, there is a need to explore the indirect effects of international capital flows on SDGs through the moderating role of ICT. Therefore, we suggest the following hypothesis.H3 ICT diffusion moderates the effects of international capital flows on the economic, social and environmental SDGs.   Based on the arguments presented above, we built a theoretical model (Fig. 1  ) that includes as inputs (international capital flows), a process (ICT and governance), and an output (SDGs).   3 Data and methodology 3.1 Data and variable justification To validate the proposed hypotheses, our study utilizes data from 41 SSA countries spanning the period from 2000 to 2018. The selection of countries and the periodicity are constrained by data availability. The data used in this study are sourced from four reliable providers, namely (a) the World Development Indicators (WDI), (b) the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), (c) the World Governance Indicators (WGI), and (d) the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). 3.1.1 Dependent variables Overall, the dependent variables are both aggregated and disaggregated. Indeed, in our study, we use the 17 SDGs to construct three indices related to the pillars of sustainability, namely economic, social, and environmental sustainability, which are then aggregated to obtain an overall sustainability index. Following Dhahri et al. [29 ], we construct composite indices measuring the three pillars of sustainable development using the well-known PCA method and data from 17 SDGs. Table 1   provides representative indicators for each of the 17 SDGs. The construction of composite indices follows five essential steps: (i) Justification of the theoretical framework (this step clarifies the concept being measured by the index and its theoretical foundation),(ii) Selection of indicators (this step involves identifying a set of indicators that are relevant, reliable, and representative of the concept being measured), (iii) Imputation of missing data (this step involves addressing any missing data in the dataset in a statistically sound manner), (iv) Standardization of data (this step ensures that all indicators are on the same scale, making them comparable), and (v) Weighting and aggregation (this step involves assigning weights to each indicator and combining them to produce a single index value).1  1 The OECD/Joint Research Centre (2008) guide to constructing composite indicators provides detailed guidance on each of these steps.   After defining the theoretical framework and data selection, we continue with the normalization and aggregation of indicators. There are numerous methods of data normalization in the literature on index construction (among others, Min-Max, ranking, Z-score (OECD, 2008). The widely recognized Min-Max method [29 ] was utilized in this study. The Min-Max transformation is represented by equation (1) :(1) X t , i , j   = X t , i , j  ′  − X t , min , j  ′   X t , max , j  ′  − X t , min , j  ′        (2) X t , i , j   = 1 − X t , i , j  ′  − X t , min , j  ′   X t , max , j  ′  − X t , min , j  ′        where X t , i , j      = value for variable i measured in region j in year t; and X t , min , j  ′    , X t , max , j  ′     refers to the minimum and maximum of variable i. Equation (1)  is employed for variables that correlate positively with sustainability, while equation (2)  is employed for variables that correlate negatively with sustainability, as shown in Table 1 . The last step involves weighting and aggregating the data to create an index through the utilization of principal component analysis (PCA) techniques. This approach aims to reduce the multitude of variables by emphasizing the variance in the observed data through their linear interrelationships. In contrast to arithmetic and geometric methods, which assign equal weights to all variables, PCA derives distinct weights for each variable rather than treating them equally, as highlighted in the study by Tchamyou et al. (2022). In order to assess social sustainability, three principal components (SS1, SS2, and SS3) were selected and accounted for 63.832% of the total variance, as seen in Table 2  . Economic sustainability was evaluated through three factor scores (ES1, ES2, and ES3), which explained 79.677% of the overall variation. The environmental sustainability index was then determined using two principal components (ENS1 and ENS2), which accounted for 71.144% of the total variance. Following this, Bregar et al.'s (2008) methodology was employed to calculate the indices for each dimension. This method involves a weighted average of the selected principal components.S I  p  = ∑ i = 1  m  F P i   * λ i   ∑ i = 1  m  λ i        where S I  p     denotes the sustainability index that is calculated as a weighted average of the m values of the PCs for unit p. F P i      stands for the value of the I th     PC for unit p, whereas λ i     corresponds to the eigenvalue of the I th     PC.Social  sustainability = ( λ 1   * SS 1 + λ 2   *  SS 2 + λ 3   *  SS 3  )  / ∑ λ     Environmental  sustainability = ( λ 1   * ENS 1 + λ 2  * ENS 2  )  / ∑ λ     Economic  sustainability = ( λ 1  * ES 1 + λ 2  * ES 2 + λ 3  * ES 3  )  / ∑ λ       3.1.2 Independent variables ⁃ Foreign direct investment (FDI) : Following Camarero et al. (2019), we employ inward FDI in terms of stocks rather than flows since FDI stocks can detect long-term impacts more accurately than FDI flows. According to Subasat and Bellos (2013), FDI stocksare more stable than FDI flows. The FDI stock measures the value of net equity of foreign investors granted to resident firms in the declaring economy (OECD). FDI stock is measured as a percentage of GDP.  ⁃ Personal remittances : include current cash transfers that resident households receive from nonresident households, as well as net remuneration of employees by persons who work abroad for short periods (UNCTAD).Personal remittances received at current prices in US dollars in millions.  ⁃ Governance quality:  Following the study of Omri et al. [30 ], we use the PCA method to aggregate the six governance indicators into three categories used as moderator variables (see Table 3 ). To distinguish three different factors (political, economic and institutional governance), we use three separate PCA on a set of six indicators. We opt for the principal component of each PCA. The first component, political governance, encompasses voice and accountability, as well as political stability. The second component, economic governance, includes regulatory quality and governance effectiveness. Finally, the third component, institutional governance, encompasses the rule of law and control of corruption.   ⁃ ICT diffusion:  In accordance with the ITU (2011) conceptual framework, using sevenof the 11 indicators proposed by the ITU and based on data availability and PCA methodology, we construct three ICT indices, namely access, use, and skills to measure the degree of development of ICT diffusion. The results of the PCA are presented in Table 4 . The weight values were determined using the following steps: (i) the squared component weights were divided by the percentage of variance explained by the component, (ii) the resulting values were multiplied by the percentage of total variance explained by the component, and (iii) the sum of these weights was rescaled to 100.     3.1.3 Control variables Besides the main variables, we include some control variables in the regression models, namely government spending, population size, financial development, and domestic investment that may affect SDGs in order to support our empirical results. These variables are collected from the WDI online databases. Financial development is expressed as the ratio of private credit by the depository bank to GDP; population size is measured as the total number of the population; government expenditure is expressed as government final consumption expenditure (% of GDP); and domestic investment is represented as gross fixed capital formation (% of GDP). Based on previous studies ([31 ]; Omri et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2022; [32 ,33 ]), we predict that government expenditure, financial development, and domestic investment have a positive impact on economic, social, and environmental sustainability. By contrast, population size affects them negatively (Aisen &Veiga, 2013; Aust et al., 2019).   3.2 Estimation strategy Consistent with previous studies presented in section 2 , this study begins by specifying a baseline where only the control variables enter our model of sustainable development. Then, we progressively introduce into the model international capital flows (FDI and remittances); the quality of governance (political, economic, and institutional); and ICT diffusion (access, use, and skills). Finally, according to our assumptions, we introduce interaction terms for governance quality and international capital flows on the one hand, and ICT diffusion and international capital flows on the other hand into the models. Our basic model is specified as follows:(3) S D G  i t   = α 0  + β 1  S D G  i t − 1   + β 2  I C F  i t   + β 3  G o v  i t   + β 4  I C T  i t   + β j  X i t   + μ i t       where S D G  i t      is the three pillars of sustainable development. Also, S D G  i t − 1      is the lag three pillars of sustainable development, I C F  i t      is international capital flows, G o v  i t      is governance quality, I C T  i t      is ICT diffusion, and X i t      is the vector of control variables including domestic investment, government expenditure, population, and financial development. μ i t   = v i  + δ t  + ε i t     , where v i     is unobserved country-specific fixed effects, δ t     is the time effects, and ε i t      is the idiosyncratic error term. Then, by incorporating the interaction terms between (i) governance and international capital flows and (ii) ICT diffusion and international capital flows, equation (3)  is modified into equation (4)  as follows:(4) S D G  i t   = α 0  + β 1  S D G  i t − 1   + β 2  I C F  i t   + β 3  G o v  i t   + β 4  I C T  i t   + β j  X i t   + π 1  ( I C F  i t   * G o v  i t    )  + π 2  ( I C F  i t   * I C T  i t    )  + μ i t       Where ICF*Gov  is the interactions effect of international capital flows and governance on SDGs, ICF*ICT  is the interaction effects of international capital flows and ICT diffusion on SDGs, and π is the coefficient of the interaction effects. Hence, we expect that national governance and ICT diffusion drive the realization of the SDGs. To estimate equations (3) and (4) , it should be noted that it is preferable to use techniques that deal with the potential endogeneity problems arising from the introduction of the sustainable development lag. The problem of endogeneity arises because S D G  i t − 1      depends on μ i t     , which in turn is influenced by the specific effect in country v i    . To mitigate the presence of endogeneity, which could bias our estimates (Wooldridge, 2002), we utilize the GMM system technique (Arellano & Bover, 1995). This estimation approach is especially useful for panel dataset where the number of time periods is relatively smaller than the cross-sections included, making it an applicable technique for analyzing data structured in this manner (Roodman, 2006). Additionally, it is crucial to consider that the robustness of the estimates obtained through the GMM technique relies on various post-estimation tests. To ensure a valid specification in the GMM approach, the concepts of identification and exclusion must be taken into account. Variables must be classified as predetermined or purely exogenous during the identification process. This research uses a GMM-type estimator to treat independent variables as endogenous or predetermined, in line with current literature (see Tchamyou & Asongu, 2017; Tchamyou et al., 2019 and Tchamyou, 2019). Year dummies are the only variables considered purely exogenous. The "iv(years, equ (dif))" procedure suggested by Roodman (2009) is used to deal with year dummies, treating years as instrumental variables (IV). According to this method, the year indicator variables are not endogenous after the first differentiation. To examine the validity of the exclusion restriction of years as instruments, the study uses the Hansen difference test (HDT). The null hypothesis of the HDT is that the instruments are exogenous. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, it provides statistical evidence for the exclusion of year dummies as endogenous variables. In addition, the study uses the Sargan Identification Restrictions (SIR) test to assess whether the instruments used in the instrumental variable (IV) estimation process are valid. The rejection of the null hypothesis in the SIR test indicates that the instruments are invalid and cannot explain the result variable. Furthermore, according to Roodman (2009), the use of orthogonal term differences rather than primary differences has two advantages: on the one hand, it takes account of the dependency between countries and, on the other, it limits the need for a large number of instruments or excessive over-identification.   4 Empirical results The descriptive statistics in Table 5     provide further insights into the economic and social dynamics of the sample countries from Sub-Saharan Africa during the period of 2000–2018. On average, the level of environmental sustainability (Envindex) is moderate, indicating the need for greater efforts to address environmental challenges across the region. Meanwhile, the average economic sustainability (Ecoo) score is relatively higher, suggesting some stability in key economic indicators over this time period. Social sustainability (Social) also averaged at a moderate level, indicating a mixed performance across countries in terms of social development goals. The moderate average values for remittances (Lnrem) and foreign direct investment (Lnfdi) reflect the importance of these financial inflows for supporting economic activity in the region. ICT access averaged moderately as well, though scores for ICT use and skills showroom for improvement, highlighting an opportunity to strengthen digital development. The average political governance (po_gov), economic governance (ec_gov), and institutional governance (in_gov) scores point to ongoing challenges in these areas of governance. Effective structures will continue to be needed to support stronger sustainability outcomes going forward. Domestic investment (inv) was relatively high on average, suggesting a significant level of economic activity within the region. However, the average population (pop) was also high across countries, presenting challenges for balancing growth and development with environmental protection and resource management. Public expenditure (gener) averaged at a significant level as well, underlining the important role of government spending in promoting both economic growth and social development outcomes. Fig. 2   provides an overview of the relationships between international capital flows and sustainability in this study. It shows the economic, social, and environmental sustainability dimensions each exhibit different trends with international capital flows. Specifically, there is a slightly positive link between economic sustainability and all capital flows. Social sustainability shows a slightly positive link with FDI and a slightly stronger positive link with remittances. Meanwhile, environmental sustainability has a negative link with FDI but a neutral link with remittances. Fig. 3   gives an overview of the relationships between ICT diffusion and sustainable development. It illustrates a positive relationship between ICT diffusion and economic and social sustainability, but a negative relationship with environmental sustainability. Fig. 4   provides an overview of the relationships between governance quality and sustainability. It indicates economic and social sustainability have a positive relationship with all three categories of governance, whereas environmental sustainability shows a slightly negative relationship. However, the bivariate relationships presented in Figs. 2–4  may be influenced by other macro variables. Therefore, these relationships require testing with an empirical model to account for potential confounding factors. The following section accordingly presents the appropriate regression results. 4.1 Effects of international capital flows and governance quality on SDGs This subsection presents the findings on the direct and indirect impacts of international capital flows on economic, social, and environmental sustainability dimensions. Table 6   shows the results of the interactive effects between governance quality and international capital flows as they relate to economic sustainability. Table 7   displays the results on the synergistic relationship between governance and capital flows in influencing social sustainability. Finally, Table 8   presents the empirical findings on how governance and international capital flows interact to improve environmental quality. Together, these tables assess the role of governance as a conditional factor that complements international capital flows to positively influence the three dimensions of sustainability. Table 6  presents the results for the effect of international capital flows and governance on economic sustainability. The baseline results for Model 1 show that domestic investment and financial development are positive and statistically significant. The results reported in model show positive effects of international capital flows, particularly FDI, on economic sustainability. This result confirms the findings of Chuang (1998), Li &Tanna (2019); Fang (2021) who argued that FDI can help promote long-term economic sustainability in host countries through various channels, including infrastructure development, employment creation, export promotion, and structural transformation. FDI can have a positive impact on economic growth of the host country through several means, including providing essential capital, generating new employment opportunities, fostering productivity spillovers, and transferring technology, skills, and management expertise (Prasad et al., 2003). Models 4 and 6 provide strong empirical evidence on the positive effects of political and institutional governance on economic sustainability. Good governance influences a country's economic growth through various factors, such as respect for property rights, appropriate regulatory policies, and political stability - all of which attract sustained private investment over the long-run (North, 1990; Knack & Keefer, 1997). Strong and effective institutions help mitigate uncertainty, enforce contracts, and maintain geopolitical predictability needed for businesses to plan investments with reasonable confidence in stable future cash flows. This encourages long-horizon capital commitment beyond short-term speculative flows. Robust governance also deters corruption that diverts resources from productive uses (Keefer & Knack, 2002). In addition to the unconditional effects of FDI and remittances, this study focuses on investigating the conditional effects of governance quality (political, economic and institutional) on the association between international capital flows and economic sustainability. Based on studies conducted by Tchamyou & Asongu, and (2017; Tchamyou, (2019), the overall effects of interactions between governance dimensions and international capital flows on economic sustainability are evaluated by calculating net effects. For each model estimate, a positive net effect confirms validation of the hypothesis tested, while a negative net effect means rejection of the hypothesis tested. In Table 6 , models 7 to 12 show that political governance and institutional governance have positive net effects on economic sustainability. For example, in the eighth column (model 7) of Table 6 , the net effect on economic sustainability resulting from the interaction between political governance and FDI is 0.0068 [(0.0269 × (−0.431)) + 0.0184]. This formula indicates that −0.431 is the average value of political governance, 0.0269 is the marginal effect of increasing political governance and 0.0184 is the unconditional effect of FDI. The positive net effects partially support our hypothesis, which postulates the effectiveness of governance, particularly political and institutional governance, in modulating the relationship between international capital flows (FDI in models 7 and 9; and remittances in models 10 and 12) and economic sustainability. Specifically, while international capital flows alone improve economic sustainability, additional benefits are obtained when they are accompanied by good political and institutional governance. This indicates that good governance effectively complements the positive impact of FDI and remittances on economic sustainability. This implies that well-defined governance structures are therefore a prerequisite for attracting higher levels of beneficial FDI and remittances, as noted in previous studies (Gani, 2007; Lehnert et al., 2013). This result is consistent with the findings of Grahadi et al. (2020) who examined how governance quality interacts with foreign aid to influence economic sustainability in Indonesia. They found that when a country has better political and regulatory governance, foreign aid has a greater positive effect on economic indicators. This suggests that the effectiveness of foreign aid in promoting economic sustainability depends on the quality of governance in a country. Table 7  presents the results of the effect of international capital flows and governance quality on social sustainability. The results of our baseline model show that FDI and remittances positively affect social sustainability with a significant coefficient only for remittances (Models 2 and 3). The results show that a 1% increase in remittances increases social sustainability by 0.008% (Model 2). Remittances can increase social sustainability, primarily by reducing poverty, maintaining food security, providing support for education and health spending, and creating jobs and wealth [19 ,20 ,34 ]. This result aligns with the findings of Azam et al. (2016) who examined the influence of remittances on poverty alleviation across 39 lower-middle, upper-middle and high-income nations using panel data. Their study discovered remittances had a beneficial impact on decreasing poverty levels within upper-middle-income states specifically, with each 1% rise in remittance flows bringing about a 0.2% fall in poverty reduction. Regarding the effect of governance, Models 4, 5, and 6 indicate that political, economic and institutional dimensions of governance have statistically significant positive associations with social sustainability outcomes. Specifically, countries with robust democratic processes, stable macroeconomic conditions, and effective policymaking institutions tend to exhibit greater social sustainability performance (Asamoah, 2021). By extension, the results suggest nations with strong governance are better positioned to strategically invest tax revenues in vital social services like education and healthcare. This has follow-on effects of potentially raising wages and living standards over the long run, as a more skilled populace leads to economic opportunities that can enhance social well-being and promote equitable income distribution [35 ]. Regarding the conditional effects, the net effects on social sustainability resulting from the interaction between political and economic governance and FDI are positive, with values of 0.0022 and 0.003 respectively in models 7 and 8. This suggests that political and economic governance reinforces the impact of FDI on social sustainability. Furthermore, with regard to remittances, the net effects on social sustainability resulting from the interaction between political, economic and institutional governance and remittances are also positive, with values of 0.0088, 0.0101 and 0.0107 respectively in models 10, 11 and 12. This shows that improving the quality of governance supports a favorable national system that enhances the impact of remittances on social sustainability. In this context, Ogunniyi et al. [36 ] show that when a country has a good governance structure, the positive effects of remittances on food security and nutrition are amplified. Similar result was found by Ofori and Asongu [37 ] who confirmed the positive contribution of governance quality to the relationship between FDI and social improvements. Table 8  presents the results of the effect of international capital flows and governance quality on environmental sustainability. We find that FDI and remittances negatively affected environmental sustainability, but this effect is only significant for FDI (Models 2 and 3). This result confirms the findings of Omri et al. (2014), Zhang & Zhou (2016), and Singhania & Saini [16 ] who have shown that multinational corporations based in advanced countries tend to shift the production of their pollution-intensive products to developing countries with lower environmental standards. The primary motivation behind this production shifting is to reduce implementation costs (Bommer, 1999). FDI can also lead to environmental degradation by stimulating industrialization through increased production, depletion of natural resources, and demand for fossil fuels [38 ]. The results of Models 4, 5, and 6 show that, with the exception of economic governance, political governance and institutional governance improve environmental sustainability. Our results provide confirmation to the assertions that good governance plays a crucial role in safeguarding the environment and, consequently, in the attainment of sustainable development's environmental objectives (Ben Youssef et al., 2018). According to Gunningham (2011), political and institutional governance plays a crucial role in establishing and enforcing environmental regulations. Governments can implement policies such as emission standards, pollution control measures, and natural resource management to promote environmental sustainability. These regulations create a framework that incentivizes businesses and individuals to adopt more sustainable practices. Models 7 to 12 examine the conditional impact of international capital flows on environmental sustainability in the presence of political, economic and institutional governance. The net effects on environmental sustainability resulting from the interaction between political and institutional governance and FDI are negative, at −0.0016 and −0.0098 respectively (Models 7 and 9). In these models, although the marginal effects between governance and FDI are systematically positive, the unconditional effects of governance and FDI remain negative. However, these independent negative effects are not interpreted independently in the interactive regressions, as these are not interpreted as linear additive models (Tchamyou, 2019). Consequently, independent indicators (i.e., measures of governance and FDI) should be considered alongside the corresponding conditional effects in order to assess the overall impact on environmental sustainability: this is the main justification for calculating net effects in interactive regressions. After establishing the negative net effects, we move on to calculate the minimum thresholds at which political and institutional governance could improve FDI to achieve environmental sustainability. These thresholds have political implications, as below critical thresholds, political and institutional governance is not strong enough to modulate FDI to ensure environmental sustainability. Consistent with studies by Asongu et al. (2017) and Omri et al. (2022), the threshold concept corresponds to a critical point at which the moderating effect of a policy variable (in this case governance) completely neutralizes the undesirable effect of an independent variable (FDI), thus anticipating a combined effect on the outcome variable (environmental sustainability). This threshold is of crucial importance in guiding policy-makers towards the specific targets of the moderating variables needed to achieve the desired development effects. In Model 7, a threshold of 0.250 (0.0006/0.0024) represents the minimum threshold of political governance for FDI to have a positive effect on environmental sustainability. In this calculation, 0.0006 is the absolute value of the unconditional effect of FDI on environmental sustainability, while 0.0024 represents the conditional effect between political governance and FDI on environmental sustainability. Similarly, Model 9 indicates that a threshold of 0.539 (0.0048/0.0089) represents the minimum threshold of institutional governance for FDI to have a positive effect on environmental sustainability. For thresholds to be economically relevant, they must fall within the statistical range (min and max) indicated in the summary statistics. In this case, the threshold established has political relevance, since the corresponding ranges are: −2.195 to 1.011′ for political governance and −1.751 to 0.9736′ for institutional governance. The thresholds calculated show that a political and institutional level below 0.250 and 0.539, respectively, does not allow FDI to induce a positive effect on environmental sustainability. In other words, good political and institutional governance above the critical threshold is essential to ensure the positive effects of FDI on environmental sustainability. This result confirmed the findings of Bokpin [39 ] and Omri & Bel Hadj (2020) who examined the effectiveness of governance quality and technological innovation in moderating the effects of FDI on air pollution. They conclude that good governance is essential to attracting responsible FDI and ensuring positive environmental outcomes. It ensures transparency, accountability, stability and investor protection, all of which are essential elements for foreign investors. In addition, good governance promotes environmental regulations and compliance with standards, leading to sustainable, environmentally-friendly investments.  4.2 Effects of international capital flows and ICT diffusion on SDGs Table 9   presents the results of the effect of international capital flows and ICT diffusion on economic sustainability. The findings from Models 4, 5 and 6 show that, with the exception of ICT skills, ICT diffusion positively and significantly affects economic sustainability. These results confirm the findings of Czernich et al. (2011), Adeleye & Eboagu (2019), Pradhan et al. [40 ], among others, who found that the diffusion of ICT has a significant positive impact on economic sustainability through various mechanisms, such as reducing unemployment, fostering e-commerce, enhancing human capital development, facilitating information dissemination, and leveraging network externalities. It also promotes economic growth by encouraging investments in ICT infrastructure and increasing ICT adoption. This, in turn, creates more job opportunities, boosts business productivity, accelerates productivity, and spurs innovation in sectors enabled by ICT [41 ]. ICT creates a network effect, whereby economic growth and productivity are enhanced as internet connectivity expands. This leads to a robust positive correlation between internet connectivity and economic growth [42 ]. Models 7 to 12 provide an overview of the conditional effect of international capital flows on economic sustainability through ICT diffusion (access, use and skills). The results reveal strong empirical evidence that international capital flows contribute to improving economic sustainability. However, the presence of ICT amplifies these gains, leading to additional positive effects on economic sustainability. The net effect on economic sustainability resulting from the interaction between ICT use and FDI is positive, with a value of 0.0107 (model 9). For remittances, the net effects on economic sustainability resulting from the interaction between ICT access and use and remittances are also positive, with values of 0.018 and 0.0.040 in models 10 and 11 respectively. This indicates that ICT diffusion, particularly ICT access and use, effectively complements the positive impact of FDI and remittances on economic sustainability. ICTs have made the economy more interconnected and globalized, facilitating access to resources and information. Digital platforms have also made it easier for economic agents to reach key markets and develop their activities. This facilitates the opening up of global markets, improves returns on investment, increases value added and creates new business opportunities for all players in the economy - thereby increasing FDI and remittances (Kumar and Vu, 2014; [43 ]). In addition, the spread of ICT increases the positive effect of remittances on economic sustainability, by facilitating the transfer of funds to the country of origin through remittance-related payment methods and banking services, which can help increase competition and reduce the cost of remittances (Kumar and Vu, 2014). Similarly, Bello et al. [43 ] examined the joint effects of ICT and FDI for sub-Saharan African countries, and their findings revealed that ICT investments can lead to attract more FDI, resulting in elevated economic growth. Moreover, they highlighted the synergistic effect between ICT diffusion and FDI can contribute to inclusive growth and shared prosperity. Table 10   presents the findings of the effect of international capital flows and ICT diffusion on social sustainability. According to the results of Models 4–6, the diffusion of ICT has a positive and significant impact on social sustainability. These findings are consistent with most of previous studies (e.g., Mimbi & Bankole, 2015; Lee & Lio, 2016; Tchamyou et al., 2019 [44 ]; Koutou et al., 2020; [45 ]) that have also highlighted the transformative potential of ICT in improving lives through innovative applications and services. In the education field, ICT diffusion has the ability to promote equity in Sub-Saharan Africa's educational landscape by increasing access to information and knowledge, reducing research costs, and streamlining administrative processes [46 ]. Additionally, within the healthcare sector, ICT plays a significant role in decentralizing health systems, overcoming geographical limitations, and bringing healthcare providers closer to those in need [44 ]. The conditional effects of international capital flows on social sustainability through ICT access, use and skills are presented in Models 7 to 12. It is clear that with the favorable effects of international capital flows on social sustainability, some additional gains are evident in the presence of ICT diffusion. The results indicate that access to and use of ICTs is effective moderators of the effects of FDI and remittances on social sustainability in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, the net effects on social sustainability resulting from the interaction between ICT access and use and FDI are positive (models 7 and 8). Similarly, for remittances, the net effects on social sustainability resulting from the interaction between ICT use and remittances are positive (model 11). These results demonstrate that ICT access et ICT use modulate the relationship between international capital flows and social sustainability. In fact, ICT diffusion enhances the effect of international capital flows on social sustainability in sub-Saharan African countries by creating employment opportunities, expanding markets, encouraging innovation, facilitating repair and maintenance, and promoting job retention and skills enhancement [43 ]. FDI in these countries concerns the extractive, aviation and telecommunications sectors, which require the spread of ICT to take advantage of the associated opportunities (UNCTAD, 2019). In addition, ICT plays a key role in improving access to financial services. The digitization of banking operations through ICT brings flexibility and convenience, reducing dependence on physical bank branches and facilitating access to financial services, which in turn contributes to increasing remittances and has a positive impact on overall living conditions [28 ]. In Table 11  , Models 4, 5, and 6 present the impacts of ICT on environmental sustainability. The coefficients in these models show that ICT access, use, and skills improve environmental sustainability. However, the significance of these coefficients is only observed for ICT access and use. Our results confirm the findings of Higón et al. [47 ] and Ahmed & Le [48 ]who found that ICT can improve environmental quality by reducing CO2  emissions. Similarly, with the ICT revolution, modern transportation systems have been adopted and modern software has been implemented to facilitate traffic management, resulting in reduced energy use and emissions [48 ]. Models 7 to 12 examine the conditional impact of international capital flows on environmental sustainability in the presence of ICT diffusion (access, use, and skills). The net effects on environmental sustainability resulting from the interaction between ICT access and use and FDI are negative, at −0.002 and −0.003 respectively (Models 7 and 8). Similarly, for remittances, the net effects on environmental sustainability resulting from the interaction between ICT access and use and remittances are negative, at −0.0018 and −0.0023 respectively (Models 10 and 11). In this respect, a critical threshold is needed for FDI and remittances to have a positive impact on environmental sustainability. For instance, in Model 7 and 8, thresholds of 0.4776 (0.0032/0.0067) and 0.4772 (0.0042/0.0088) respectively represent the minimum thresholds of ICT access and ICT use for FDI to have a positive effect on environmental sustainability. Similarly, in Model 10 and 11, thresholds of 0.650 (0.0026/0.0040) and 0.2468 (0.0039/0.0158) respectively represent the minimum thresholds of ICT access and ICT use for remittances to have a positive effect on environmental sustainability. These established thresholds have policy relevance, as the corresponding ranges are: '0.0026 to 0.9106′ for ICT access and '0 to 0.9991′ for ICT use. The thresholds calculated show that ICT access and use above the critical threshold are essential to guarantee the positive effects of FDI and remittances on environmental sustainability. ICT diffusion plays a crucial role in mitigating the adverse effects of FDI on environmental sustainability. This is accomplished through its influence on the distribution of FDI, resulting in changes in the sectoral composition of an economy. As highlighted by Branstetter et al. (2019), ICT, particularly software, plays an increasingly important role in different manufacturing sectors, becoming a key driver of innovation. The degree of software integration in a given manufacturing industry correlates with the number of patents it generates and the reduction in carbon emissions it enables. For example, in automotive manufacturing, ICT software plays a central role in managing aspects such as fuel efficiency, carbon emissions and even the car's electrical antenna (Chi & Meng, 2022). For remittances, ICT can enable better monitoring and tracking of remittance flows, ensuring that funds are used for environmentally sustainable purposes. This can help prevent misuse of funds and promote investments in green initiatives. Moreover, ICT platforms can be used to promote and support sustainable development projects in remittance-receiving countries. For example, digital platforms can facilitate crowdfunding for environmental projects or provide information on sustainable investment opportunities (Xia et al., 2022).   5 Discussion The 2030 Agenda outlines an ambitious plan to tackle the significant environmental, social, and economic challenges faced by modern societies (2015). Member countries of the United Nations are encouraged to embrace the SDG framework as a guiding roadmap for their development and investment strategies, with the aim of monitoring their progress toward these goals during the designated 15-year period (OECD & Paris, 2017; Allen et al., 2018). Despite the non-binding nature of the SDGs, it is anticipated that nations will assume responsibility for them and establish domestic frameworks to work towards these goals through their sustainable development policies, initiatives, and projects [49 ]. The effective realization of the SDGs necessitates the mobilization of resources and financial strategies. The need for international capital flows has been widely discussed in the financial literature: to address the lack of domestic resources and savings, to build managerial capacity, to limit foreign exchange shortages, and to facilitate balance of payments in less developed countries (Aliyu, 2005). In parallel and/or as a complement to international capital flows, several factors can be cited as catalysts for achieving the SDGs. First, ICT, as a communication tool, is used to disseminate knowledge and reduce ignorance about the processes and efforts required to achieve specific goals (Asongu et al., 2018). The increasing adoption of ICT has far-reaching consequences, influencing economic growth, the development of financial systems, academic outcomes, and even environmental sustainability. Simultaneously, while the effects of ICT diffusion and FDI on sustainability may vary across different sectors, the focus on sustainability has garnered increasing attention in recent research. Thus, with globalization, the increased diffusion of ICTs in many remote countries around the world represents opportunities for achieving many sustainable development outcomes. However, these achievements need to be adapted to ensure that the three main pillars of sustainability are addressed in a balanced manner, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Second, the quality of national governance plays a key role in development, which has attracted attention in recent years. Indeed, good governance of a country plays an important role in creating an enabling environment for the design and implementation of policies to enhance economic growth and development in general (North, 1990). Understanding the conditions that influence and catalyze the effects of international capital flows on economic, social, and environmental sustainability is the starting point of our work. In particular, our results illuminate two research gaps in the broader field of sustainability studies. First, we contribute to a general discussion of the extent to which international capital flows contribute to the achievement of the SDGs in economic, social, and environmental terms. While previous studies use one of the pillars of sustainability or use the SDGs individually without assessing their effects on each pillar of sustainable development, our study incorporates all 17 SDGs across the three pillars of sustainable development. We use a representative indicator for each goal to construct a relative index for each pillar. Our results indicate that while international capital flows have positive impacts on economic and social sustainability in SSA, they can pose a threat to the environment. This conflict between socioeconomic development and environmental sustainability represents an obstacle to the simultaneous achievement of the SDGs. To address this conflict, it is necessary to examine the conditions under which these flows can simultaneously achieve economic and social goals while ensuring environmental sustainability. Thus, our second contribution is to enrich the existing literature by focusing on the roles of governance and ICT diffusion in the effects of capital flows on the three pillars of sustainability. In this framework, we use a comprehensive measure of ICT diffusion by constructing three indices: ICT access, ICT use, and ICT skills. Additionally, we employ the six governance indicators proposed by Kaufman and Karay (2011) to construct three governance indices: political, economic, and environmental governance. Our findings indicated that political and institutional governance has positive net effects on economic sustainability. In addition, all three categories of governance have positive net effects on social sustainability. These results demonstrate the importance of good governance in ensuring that the benefits of FDI and remittances contribute positively to economic and social sustainability. Regarding ICT diffusion, the net effects on economic sustainability resulting from the interaction between (i) ICT use and FDI, and (ii) ICT access and use and remittances are positive. Similarly, the net effects on social sustainability resulting from the interaction between (i) ICT access and use and FDI, and (ii) ICT use and remittances are positive. These results indicate that ICT diffusion, and in particular ICT access and use, effectively complements the positive impact of FDI and remittances on economic and social sustainability. In contrast, the net effects on environmental sustainability resulting from the interaction between political and institutional governance and FDI are negative. Similarly, for ICT diffusion, the net effects on environmental sustainability resulting from the interaction between (i) ICT access and use and FDI, and (ii) ICT access and use and remittances are negative. These negative net effects imply that ICT governance and ICT diffusion need to be consolidated beyond certain thresholds, to achieve the desired positive net effect on environmental sustainability. Calculating the corresponding thresholds, we found values of 0.250 for political governance and 0.539 for institutional governance. Above these thresholds, the positive contribution of FDI to environmental sustainability is guaranteed. Similarly, the thresholds of 0.4776 and 0.4772 respectively represent the minimum thresholds of ICT access and ICT use for FDI to have a positive effect on environmental sustainability. For remittances to have a positive effect on environmental sustainability, the minimum thresholds for ICT access and use are 0.650 and 0.2468 respectively. Our results complement those of an earlier study by Aust et al. (2020), who also found a positive impact of FDI on key aspects of the SDGs such as infrastructure, drinking water, and renewable energy. However, they also noted negative environmental consequences, particularly for SDG13 (climate action). On the other hand, our study partially contradicts the findings of Qamri et al. [50 ], who demonstrated that, in the case of 21 Asian countries, FDI improves environmental quality, leading to a reduction in pollutant levels. However, they point to major negative effects of FDI on economic growth and financial development, suggesting complex repercussions beyond its mere environmental impact. Furthermore, underlining the importance of interactions and policies, our study highlights the crucial role of good governance practices and ICT diffusion in maximizing the benefits of international capital flows while minimizing negative consequences. This finding aligns with the conclusions of Uche et al. [51 ], which emphasized the positive interaction between FDI and environmental technological innovations, thus promoting cleaner environments in the long term. Similarly, with regard to the social effects of international capital flows, for example in developing countries, Samdrup et al. [52 ] examined the impact of FDI on food security, revealing that there is no significant evidence of an overall impact of FDI on food security, although subgroup analysis suggests a negative impact when FDI is considered as a stock variable. Similarly, Farrukh et al [53 ] found evidence of a negative effect of remittances on food security in Pakistan. With regard to poverty reduction, the results are variable, particularly concerning the effect of remittances on poverty in sub-Saharan Africa [20 ]. Within this framework, Aderemi et al. [54 ] also found a negative short-term relationship between FDI flows and human development, but a positive long-term relationship in BRICS countries. However, our results differ significantly, showing that FDI (measured as stock) and remittances contribute positively to social sustainability, including food security. In terms of implications, a similar trend was observed in the studies by Ofori et al. [55 ], Farrukh et al. [53 ], and Leonidou et al. [56 ], highlighting the need for specific policies to ensure better management of financial resources. Overall, these studies offer a complex overview of the impact of international flows on some of the SDGs. While some point to positive effects in key areas such as infrastructure and drinking water, others warn of negative environmental and social consequences. Our study enriches this debate by identifying specific mechanisms for moderating the effects of international capital flows, such as the quality of governance and ICT diffusion, on economic, social, and environmental objectives. These findings offer valuable guidance for policies to promote sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on effective government practices and the promotion of modern technologies based on suggested thresholds. In light of these results, we recommend policymakers in SSA countries to increase their efforts in improving governance quality and ICT diffusion (particularly, access to and use of ICT) as opportunities to achieve the SDGs. Indeed, mobile technologies and services in 2019 generated 9% of GDP in SSA – a contribution that amounted to $155 billion in economic value added. Similarly, the mobile ecosystem supported more than 3.8 million jobs (direct and indirect) and made a substantial contribution to public sector funding, with nearly $17 billion collected through taxation. By 2024, the contribution of mobile services will reach nearly $185 billion, as countries increasingly benefit from productivity and efficiency improvements brought about by the increased adoption of mobile services. The informal economy plays an important role in the mobile ecosystem in sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately 1.4 million of the 2 million direct employees in the mobile ecosystem are informally employed in the distribution and retailing of mobile services (GSMA, 2020). Mobile connectivity offers the opportunity to accelerate the digital transformation of sub-Saharan Africa and drive socioeconomic progress in areas such as healthcare, education, digital commerce, industry automation, and smart city infrastructure (GSMA, 2021). In addition, international capital flows should be attracted through the development of technopoles and industrial parks in the region to promote the commercialization of high-tech products, and the development of patents to provide logistical and technical support to the region's young and creative population to make a realistic contribution to sustainable development. In addition to ICT diffusion, policymakers should prioritize the strengthening and effective functioning of governance institutions. This entails implementing suitable regulations, laws, property rights, and anti-corruption measures, which, when consistently monitored, can contribute to advancements in economic, social, and environmental conditions. Indeed, good governance plays a critical role in ensuring political freedom and improving access to information. These factors, in turn, bolster citizens' aspirations for a cleaner environment and raise public awareness of environmental legislation. Given the importance of governance in channeling the effects of international capital flows in achieving the SDGs, broader governance and institutional reforms are needed to anchor the relationship between the effects of international capital flows and the three pillars of sustainability, particularly environmental sustainability. In SSA countries where the pursuit of short-term growth necessitates the promotion of FDI flows and remittances, it becomes imperative to strengthen governance and institutions to effectively regulate the activities of both companies and citizens that may have an impact on the environment. This measure is essential to ensure that the development dynamics in SSA align with the goals of sustainable development. Notably, SSA is recognized as the world's most resource-rich region in terms of oil and gas, mineral resources, and other valuable metals. To ensure consistency with the sustainable development agenda, it is crucial to reinforce governance mechanisms to manage and regulate these valuable resources effectively (Aryeetey et al., 2012; Smith, 2020; [57 ]).  6 Conclusion This study assessed the effects of international capital flows, particularly FDI and remittances, on achieving the SDGs using data from 41 SSA countries from 2000 to 2018. In addition to the direct effects, we examine the indirect effects of international capital flows on achieving the 17 SDGs. Specifically, we investigate the role of governance quality and the diffusion of ICTs as mechanisms that moderate the effects of international capital flows on SDGs. By considering both the direct and indirect effects of international capital flows and incorporating governance quality and ICT diffusion as moderating variables, this study offers novel insights into the complex dynamics between international capital flows and the attainment of SDGs. The results of the system GMM method deemphasized the crucial role of governance quality and ICT diffusion as effective mechanisms that moderate the relationship between international capital flows and SDGs in SSA countries. Specifically, the effects of international capital flows on sustainable development exhibits a mix of positive and negative effects across the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. However, the presence of good governance practices and widespread diffusion of ICTs serves as crucial conditional factors in explaining the relationship between international capital flows and SDGs, strengthening the positive impact of international capital flows on the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development. Furthermore, a certain threshold must be reached in governance and ICT diffusion for FDI and remittances to have a positive impact on environmental sustainability. Despite the novelty of this research, it has some limitations. First, due to constraints in data availability for countries in SSA, the study selected only one core representative indicator for each of the seventeen SDGs, whereas the UN framework had proposed multiple potential indicators per goal. Second, this research focuses on two specific conditions that catalyze the effects of international capital flows on SDGs. However, it is important to acknowledge that other conditions may exist that could also influence these effects. For instance, future studies could explore the role of public infrastructure and financial sector development as potential moderators of the impact of international capital flows on achieving the SDGs. Third, regarding governance measures, the study only addresses the effects of formal governance indicators. To provide a more nuanced understanding, it would be beneficial for future research to incorporate informal indicators of governance, such as economic freedom, to capture a broader spectrum of governance dynamics.
