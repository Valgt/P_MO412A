                  Food, energy, and water resources are intricately interconnected, and nexus provides a holistic approach for addressing these complex links to minimize inefficiencies and waste. Nexus approach and circular economy are considered as effective solutions for sustainability. Quantification of these relations is the first step towards incorporating nexus modeling which helps sustainable production and consumption. For achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, understanding and effectively managing the FEW nexus becomes imperative. With an integral performance perspective, there is a need to address the interdependencies and trade-offs among food, energy, and water systems and challenges of economic, social and environmental sustainability. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the FEW nexus, identify key opportunities and challenges, and propose integrated strategies for managing these core environmental verticals sustainably. The study addresses the accomplishment of these goals through nexus approaches and outlines the need for technological advancements for shared benefits among resources, contributing to conceptual development of nexus and circular economy. The results highlight the critical importance of adopting a nexus approach to advance sustainable development goals, enhance resource efficiency, and promote synergistic solutions across food, energy, and water systems.

Editor: Damia Barcelo Food, energy, and water resources are intricately interconnected, and nexus provides a holistic approach for addressing these complex links to minimize inefficiencies and waste. Nexus approach and circular economy are considered as effective solutions for sustainability. Quantification of these relations is the first step towards incorporating nexus modeling which helps sustainable production and consumption. For achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, understanding and effectively managing the FEW nexus becomes imperative. With an integral performance perspective, there is a need to address the interdependencies and trade-offs among food, energy, and water systems and challenges of economic, social and environmental sustainability. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the FEW nexus, identify key opportunities and challenges, and propose integrated strategies for managing these core environmental verticals sustainably. The study addresses the accomplishment of these goals through nexus approaches and outlines the need for technological advancements for shared benefits among resources, contributing to conceptual development of nexus and circular economy. The results highlight the critical importance of adopting a nexus approach to advance sustainable development goals, enhance resource efficiency, and promote synergistic solutions across food, energy, and water systems.

The increasing demand for these resources is directly impacted by growing population and economic growth (Borge-Diez et al., 2022 ). Inadequate, unsafe, and insecure food, energy, and water supply lead to global crisis that threatens survival of living organisms and vegetation (de Amorim et al., 2018 ). Food, energy, and water are interconnected due to their fundamental roles in supporting human life, economic activities, and environmental sustainability. Water and food production both require significant energy inputs. Energy production often relies on water resources for cooling and steam generation. Providing clean and safe drinking water requires energy-intensive processes such as water treatment and distribution. Efficient irrigation practices and water management are critical for sustainable food production. Energy production and consumption can also impact water quality through pollution and contamination. The availability of these interlinked resources is deteriorating with the rise in global demand and lifestyle of human beings (Ringler et al., 2013 ). The issues of water and food availability as well as land use are gaining increased attention and are linked to energy generation and its usage. The inter-dependence of food, energy, and water resources has prompted need for a nexus strategy. Food, Energy and Water Nexus (or FEW Nexus) is a term that refers to the close relation between the systems that produce food, energy, and water (Proctor et al., 2021 ). Nexus offers valuable framework for understanding the advantages of renewable energy that transcend across domains of food, water and energy (Abdi et al., 2020 ). Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, offer opportunities for resource efficiency and synergies within the nexus and contribute to climate change mitigation efforts. Nexus planning approaches integrate renewable energy considerations into water, energy, and food sector planning processes, enabling holistic decision-making and optimization of resource use. The terms “nexus” and “circular economy” (CE) are contemporary to sustainability. In order to improve system effectiveness, Nexus aims to alleviate conflicts and improve synergies among the three sectors, whereas CE provides an alternative strategy of reduce, reuse and recycle for “end-of-life” concept and has various aspects which ranges from environmental and economic to social considerations (Parsa et al., 2021 ; Serrano-Arévalo et al., 2024 ). FEW nexus can be considered a promising framework for structuring investments at large scale, with numerous policymakers highlighting its conceptuality and functional potential. The process was first launched at the UN Conference on Human Environment and supported by two decades of conventions expanding the concept of sustainability models expressed must be continued to develop investment plans based on nexus infrastructure focusing on integrated approach (Smajgl et al., 2016 ). FEW nexus approaches have built a common platform for researchers, decision-makers, and other concerned parties from the energy, food, and water sectors to comprehend and address numerous complex issues tying three sectors together. These concerns involve the allocation of resources, the development of infrastructure, socioeconomic progress, and environmental protection (Bhaduri et al., 2015 ). Fig. 1   shows various flows between and within different sectors of food, water and energy domains and depicts their interconnections. The nexus strategy can improve FEW securities by maximizing effectiveness, lowering tradeoffs, creating synergies, fostering policy integration and enhancing governance among sectors. For instance, as water is required in most of industries and power plants for different purposes such as input source for generating energy. Further it is used to irrigate agricultural land for growing crops. Moreover, energy is essential for water transport and treatment in addition to for agricultural applications. Agriculture helps produce energy through biofuels and has an impact on water quality. Nexus strategies optimize resource use across food, energy, and water systems, reducing waste and inefficiencies. Nexus strategies enhance energy security while ensuring reliable water supply and promote sustainable agriculture practices that enhance food security while minimizing environmental impacts. These inter-connections necessitate the adoption of a multidimensional perspective in order to create synergistic policies and make alternatives in each managing area that are advantageous to other sectors (Shannak et al., 2018 ). To support new strategies for joint management of three resources, it is essential to quantify the interactions of the FEW nexus.“ The Water, Energy, and Food Security Nexus-Solutions for Green Economy” conference, held in Bonn in 2011, gave FEW Nexus concepts a boost in global discussions about sustainable development and necessitated significance of nexus pillars (Endo et al., 2017 ). The Bonn conference emphasized that inter-connections among FEW should be used effectively to encourage growth of a green economy. The use of sustainable farming practices to provide food and nutrition security, cleaner energy, and safe drinking water was highlighted at the United Nations “Rio + 20” summit (Zhu et al., 2020 ). Global attention has been drawn to issues including food security, freshwater scarcity, the use of fossil fuels, and so others (Heard et al., 2017 ). Urbanization, population expansion, climate change, and environmental concerns pose a potential threat to the availability of these resources. Nexus approach focuses on comprehending and studying the interconnections between resources, whereas CE is primarily concerned with resource circularity. Despite this difference, the goals of waste minimization and resource sustainability are mutually targeted and accomplished (Al-Thani and Al-Ansari, 2021 ). In this study, the nexus approaches have been reviewed with perspective of attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in terms of direct or indirect impact and their quantification, relating them to accomplish COP26 targets of India. Along with, this review highlights the need for advancements in nexus oriented strategic planning and implementation. By taking an integrated approach to the food-water-energy nexus, India can create synergies that drive progress across multiple sectors, contributing to its efforts to meet COP26 targets and advance sustainable development.  2 Current scenario of nexus implementation and integration FEW-nexus sectors' integration can be challenging on economic, physical and political level. Recognizing industrial requirements and involving industrial partners in the development process are crucial for successful commercialization. However, there are significant barriers that need to be addressed when transitioning a technology or scientific innovation to commercial success (Boas et al., 2016 ). Modeling the nexus faces several challenges due to the complicated dynamics and interconnections between food, water, and energy resources (Shannak et al., 2018 ). However, issues have arisen during its initial implementation. Development of a technology for resource recovery from lab to pilot scale and ultimately to industrial level incurs significant costs. Industries often face challenges in addressing implementation and operations risk due to economic or regulatory factors (Udugama et al., 2020 ). Trade-offs, synergies and challenges between these resources and policies, for instance, access to basic needs of land, energy and water, minimizing resource intensive usage pattern and efficient and successful application of technologies pertinent to all domains are difficult to resolve in individually (Gjorgiev and Sansavini, 2017 ). Finding ways to value water in order to establish the nexus is one of the most crucial issues, whether in arid areas or other climates. The ways that society has evolved and used natural resources like energy and water have yet to be driven by an understanding of their value or scarcity (Briones-Hidrovo et al., 2022 ). The significant disparities in the utilization of water and energy must be addressed (Naidoo et al., 2021 ). One of the significant issues faced by South Asian countries is the increased production of food with constrained amounts of resources of water, energy and land while preserving resources and helping to maintain sustainability due to its population growth, decreasing agricultural area, increasing stress on resources, and climate changes (Rasul, 2014 ). The complex network of different laws, rules, and regulations across WEF nexus is another barrier. The government's approach to the development, implementation, and operation of resource recovery technologies significantly impacts these barriers (Udugama et al., 2020 ). Several nations have separate and segmented laws, regulations, and policies governing the water, energy, and food industries (Afsari Mamaghani et al., 2023 ). Designing the appropriate institutional structure for the practical communication and collaboration among various entities and institutions in WEF domains is a complicated challenge in addition to developing a comprehensive legal framework on WEF nexus (Astiaso Garcia et al., 2023 ). The framework of United Nations SDGs has been formulated targeting resources management with nexus approach by addressing challenges of energy, water and food securities (Kılkış et al., 2020 ). Analyzing all three domains in a single framework facilitates study of connections among agents of all three domains. The aim of this work is to develop a broad understanding on interrelationships of three sectors of nexus to efficiently integrate development goal with effective implementation. Earlier studies on the FEW nexus focused on individual sectors, with limited consideration of their interconnections and relied on sector-specific models and analyses, which failed to capture the synergies and trade-offs across the food, water, and energy sectors. Policy interventions and governance mechanisms addressing food, water, and energy issues were often fragmented, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Current research integrates perspectives from diverse disciplines which enables a more holistic understanding of the complex interactions within the FEW nexus. There have been integrated modeling frameworks and systems thinking approaches to analyze the FEW nexus which highlights the importance of integrated policy approaches and multi-level governance structures for effective management. While past research laid the groundwork for understanding the principles and potential of the nexus approach, current research has advanced significantly by adopting a more interdisciplinary and action-oriented approach. This study aims to provide an understanding of the multifaceted aspects involved in commercializing technological development of resource recovery, which is a crucial component in achieving the UN's sustainable development goals and a key pillar in the realization of the future circular economy. The political, economic and societal matters share extensive connection with these resources which further highlights the significance of this study. Therefore, the risks and unanticipated repercussions that society faces as a result of complex interplay of water, energy, and food cannot be ignored.  3 Methodology A comprehensive literature review was conducted with the objective of relating the nexus approaches and SDGs implementations by examining variety of published articles related to the Food-Energy-Water Nexus, Sustainable Development Goals, and circular economy. A set of keywords were determined initially including- food, energy and water nexus and its variations as water, energy, climate nexus, SDGs implementations through nexus and models in nexus implementations and circular economy, on science direct and google scholar. The keywords were based on different criteria: FEW related researches, their challenges and quantitative assessment. Quantitative and qualitative data relevant to the FEW Nexus, SDGs, and circular economy were collected from diverse sources and analyzed to assess current status, trends, and challenges and to identify opportunities for integration and synergy. The nexus research showed considerable changes in different time periods. Initially, the nexus study was not systematic but rather scattered. Gradually, the studies conducted related the nexus approaches to the accomplishment of the SDGs post 2015. Several case studies were selected to illustrate real-world examples of integrated approaches to managing the FEW Nexus in compliance with the SDGs. Fig. 2   is the knowledge sketch of various research conducted in the literature during last two decades, extracted by VOS viewer. The size of node represents frequency of the term used in this review.  4 Nexus implementation In food production, the identification, evaluation, and adoption of effective methods to lower energy and water usage have been the focus of numerous research projects, implementation initiatives, and policies during the past few years (Albrecht et al., 2018 ). A significant issue that is more apparent in arid and semiarid places where water sources, mainly underground water, are utilized for irrigation is providing food and nutrients to the approximately 8 billion people worldwide amidst depleting freshwater resources. Considering this, in the apparent lack of improvements in water productivity, global crop water consumption is anticipated to rise by 41 %, the implications of the nexus become relevant. A nexus methodology, which emphasizes assessing trade-offs and discovering synergies among various dimensions, is appropriate for creating novel paths. To accomplish the SDGs, nexus thinking, which emphasizes interconnectivity rather than an independent system, is necessary. To comply with the SDGs (SDGs 6, 7, 8, 11, 13 14, and 15) proposed by the UN, the international research groups have thus coordinated their initiatives to explore the FEW nexus in a comprehensive perspective (Weitz et al., 2014 ). Nexus research can significantly improve SDGs implementation by fostering synergies between climate mitigation and adaptation and more economically sustainable growth following Paris Agreement focusing on climate change. The SDGs serve as a roadmap for regionalizing the global aim and directing policy coherence (Al-Muqdadi et al., 2021 ). This work serves as a tier to establish the links between the nexus techniques and their consequent contribution towards SDGs and COP 26 targets. 4.1 Drivers of FEW Nexus The drivers depict the significance of incorporating stakeholders, institutions and decision-making processes more thoroughly across FEW sectors to minimize responsibility dispersion and encourage SDG cooperative policy frameworks (Olawuyi, 2020 ). To address the complex issues in different FEW systems, a system methodology is required to assess the synergy of related FEW resources in urban area with potential cost-effective risk tradeoffs (Chang et al., 2020 ). Fig. 3   shows factors that drive the need for adopting nexus strategies. 4.1.1 Principles of FEW Nexus Three important aspects- 3As, i.e., assessment, awareness, and accessibility of nexus governance must be prioritized within the FEW nexus for stakeholders to work together to address interconnected challenges and promote sustainable development. This developed concept be summed up as (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2021 ; Yuan and Lo, 2022, 2020 ). 4.1.1.1 Assessment For the early-stage fundamental considerations, principles that can reduce the risks of resource scarcity while also promoting environmental quality and social equality should be taken into consideration. Adopting clean technologies can minimize the use of natural resources by food waste valorization, reusing water, and recovering energy. Assessing the FEW nexus involves conducting thorough analyses of the interactions and dependencies between food, energy, and water systems. This includes evaluating resource availability, consumption patterns, and potential impacts on ecosystems. By exploring various scenarios, decision-makers can better prepare for uncertainties and develop robust strategies for sustainable resource management.  4.1.1.2 Awareness The governance in nexus aims to design and deliver alternatives to stakeholders. The formation of nexus governance is facilitated by both primary considerations and practical applications, which play significant roles. Collaboration could facilitate integration of targeted audience of the outcomes and those more prone to be influenced by action being implemented. To promote a shared vision among stakeholders, there must be cross-discipline and stakeholder understanding of food, water and energy system. Engaging diverse stakeholders in discussions and decision-making processes increases awareness of the interdependencies within the FEW nexus. Raising awareness about the FEW nexus is essential for fostering understanding and promoting responsible resource stewardship.  4.1.1.3 Accessibility Ensuring equitable access to food, energy, and water resources is essential for ensuring accessibility. Investing in infrastructure development, such as water supply systems, energy grids, and transportation networks, enhances accessibility to essential resources. The nexus governance functions as an integrated set of principles. In addition to the fundamental considerations and real-world applications, this perspective offers chances to assist in the changeover to a better nexus governance structure. A strategy or blueprint incorporating market and political factors in the form of subsidies, state goals, and profit seeking should be formulated for practical implications. A set of nine guidelines for governance of FEW nexus were developed using 3As as a framework as shown in Fig. 4  .    4.2 The concept of Nexus and its perspectives The relevance of relationship between energy, water and food security is becoming increasingly evident, and there is need to create and execute actions and policies in a coordinated way. In recent years, it has been referred to as “integrated water resource management, which can be understood as collaborative development and management of resources to ensure maximum economic and social well-being effectively and sustainably” (Rosales-Asensio et al., 2020 ). Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are used to assess the frameworks for model nexus interactions (Bieber et al., 2018 ). The transdisciplinary structure of the nexus emphasizes the significance of using scenario simulation to understand importance of interrelatedness between food, water and energy (Endo et al., 2018 ). According to how the nexus components develop and interact, these scenarios represent likely incremental changes to the current situation that could be used to evaluate the effects of particular policy choices (Bazilian et al., 2011 ). For instance, some policies that benefit the food & energy sectors, may place an unnecessary burden on the nation's hydrological strategies combating drought by encouraging increased usage of water because of readily accessible pumping. To account for these difficulties, various frameworks are being developed to analyze among nexus of the water, energy, and food (Fao, n.d. ). The first nexus perspective is risk and security focused. It is predicated on the notion that neglecting relationships between nexus domains could exacerbate resource scarcities and result in conflicts. For instance, the development of first-generation biofuels may threaten food safety. The second perspective follows rational economic thinking. The nexus is perceived in this context as a mechanism to maximize resource allocation across sectors while also increasing policy cost-effectiveness and efficiency of using resources (Weitz et al., 2017 ). It is also being seen as a support to green economy growth and the emergence of new business prospects, for instance, by assuring sustainable use of water in food and energy supply chains (Stein et al., n.d. ). According to these perspectives, managing the nexus is still a scientific or organizational issue, where improved integration of data concerning cross-sector relations can enhance or even maximize the system's performance compared to security or cost factors. The third approach is focused on social advancement and equality. It argues that dealing with trade-offs and enhancing the integration of policy across various segments is primarily a political procedure that necessitates cooperation between multiple stakeholders with varying understandings, preferences, and practices. It emphasizes that technical explanations for enhancing cohesiveness in the nexus may have unexpected and adverse effects on different areas of policy, such as reducing poverty and education (Kurian, 2017 ). The process of converting an innovation into an implemented policy forms the conceptual framework of nexus as shown in Fig. 5  .   5 Cross-sector nexus Energy needed to provide water for crop cultivation, such as through groundwater pumping, is limited in supply (de Amorim et al., 2018 ). Due to heavy energy use, food production is more susceptible to fluctuations in energy availability and price (Rasul, 2014 ). Water, energy, and land use are significantly affected by climate change impacts and growing conflicts between water and land use for hydro energy and bioenergy (Azad et al., 2015 ). Dietary preferences and farming methods influence energy and water demand. Also, various policies and subsidies related to energy, water and food influence demand for these resources. There is a disparity among sectors in terms of demand and supply due to the absence of connections between sector agencies. The cross-sectoral initiatives taken have been unidirectional, such as considering food for energy or water for food (Moioli et al., 2018 ). The interrelationship of cross nexus sectors is a crucial element of FEW nexus system and needs a comprehensive understanding and knowledge to their dependencies. Issues that have been historically treated as development and management concerns including these resources are a part of wider linked FEW systems. Although these concerns are relevant to the agricultural and energy sectors as well, the analyses of issues like agriculture, water and wastewater management and treatment, water supply, hydro energy, and have been mostly focused on hydrologic engineering and science principles. An in-depth and comprehensive understanding of exchanges between ecosystem services has also been made possible by recent advancements in ecohydrology and ecosystem restoration practices, particularly those for food and energy generation such as flow pattern and quality of water for aquatic habitats and water required for bioenergy generation (Christian-Smith and Merenlender, 2010 ). 5.1 Energy and food nexus The power availability and its production are one of the highly concerned areas of 21st century. The demand to reduce CO2  emissions and our dependency on fossil fuels collide with the demand for more energy caused by rise in population and economic expansion. The efforts to locally improve efficiency of resources can ultimately lead to worsening of state of global system compared to initial condition making it unrealistic to focus the analysis of energy generation on single sector. However, the utilization of food crops for energy production puts food production in direct competition, also affecting land and water use patterns (Harvey and Pilgrim, 2011 ). This is due to continuous requirement for feedstock for energy generation. Furthermore, intensive irrigation techniques frequently boost crop yield, resulting in higher food output but at the expense of inefficient water resource use. A challenge arises in the designing of energy generation system which considers all these factors. The existing systems of water, food, and energy supplies are optimized to deliver best possible result which develops a system efficient in the respective area (Cosgrove and Loucks, 2015 ; Kraucunas et al., 2015 ).  5.2 Food and water nexus Water is an essential requirement in energy generation as well as present in crops as virtual water due to high water requirement for growth (Finley and Seiber, 2014 ). Virtual water is a measure of water needed to obtain desired industrial output. Thus, indicators were developed as water footprints respective to virtual water (Antonelli and Sartori, 2015 ). The first indicator makes it possible to calculate how much water is used in the creation of products and services, whereas the second one makes it possible to quantify how much water is used to consume those same products and services (Chapagain and Hoekstra, 2003 ). According to the type of water sources, there is a hierarchy where some sources are more useful as compared to others from both economic and environmental aspect (Chapagain and Hoekstra, 2008 ). The ideas of blue and green water were developed to address this issue, where liquid water present below and above ground is referred to as “blue water,” such as lakes, rivers, and groundwater and soil water derived from precipitation in unsaturated zone is termed as “green water” (Gerbens-Leenes et al., 2009 ). Green water is referred to as renewable source only (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011 ). Both types of water are utilized in agriculture, whereas blue water directly competes with other uses such as industries and municipalities. However, grey water is not considered in this analysis. The nexus index for food efficiency accounts for competition between crops utilized for food and energy generation for nutrition and biofuel sectors in countries with food insecurity. Irrigation and drainage engineering techniques are frequently used to control soil moisture to increase different stages of agricultural growth, however as a consequence of climate change, these techniques are now threatened by more intense and frequent extreme weather actions (droughts, floods and heat waves). Although the term “water-for-food” is frequently associated with irrigated agriculture, aquaculture, a significant global source of food, particularly in coastal locations, also depends on water. Large inputs of land, water, fertilizer, and pesticides are frequently used in agriculture production, leading to important changes in environment in various parts of the world. In example, non-point source pollution brought on by excessive fertilizer usage in agricultural output has long been a challenge for pollution prevention and the quality of the water supply but has never been effectively addressed. Nutrient loading and transportation across stages from field to watershed to basin, as well as water quality response to nutrient cycles under climate changes and external interference, require further research (e.g., irrigation and land drainage). Additionally, study is required to create strategies, laws, and best management practices that will decrease the usage of pesticides and fertilizers, keep nutrients in the soil, and remove nutrients from wastewater (Cai et al., 2013 ; Sharpley et al., 2015 ).  5.3 Water and energy nexus Water resources are frequently a major factor in the generation and supply of energy from both traditional and developing energy sources. It is widely known that nuclear and thermoelectric power facilities consume a substantial volume of water for cooling and hydro-energy production. However, in recent years, energy production has shifted towards and renewable sources, some of which consume more water than conventional power sources (Mekonnen et al., 2015 ). A significant observation is that concentrated solar power units frequently need more water for cooling than nuclear and coal power plants of comparable scale. Significant water is used in the biomass cultivation and subsequent processing necessary to make biofuels (Housh et al., 2015 ; Song et al., 2016 ). On one hand, energy is required to transport and treat wastewater as well as for water supply and distribution. Moreover, water quality and quantity issues, particularly for local ecosystems, have been brought on by water withdrawal for and discharge from energy generating. Hydraulic fracturing has made it possible for the recent improvement of bioenergy and natural gas, which has put water quality and riparian health at risk (Cai et al., 2018 ). Within the development of water resources, there has been a long-running argument about usefulness of hydropower. Hydropower dams are frequently proposed for the purpose of supplying energy, but they also have a wide range of incidental benefits and harms. These include advantages for storage of water for drought mitigation, flood control, and recreation, as well as harms from disrupted sediment deposition and impeded fish migration. Additionally, as (Zeng et al., 2017 ) discussed case for more than half of world's installed hydropower, there may be rivalry between advantages depending on when hydropower demand and other water demands, such as irrigation, occur. Given these results, hydropower research should take into account all FEW system influences on dam operation and design. The shared work of environmentalists, water resources engineers and hydrologists is particularly challenged by creating balance between the frequently conflicting needs of energy demand, aquatic life, water supply, and other uses. This is especially true when hydrologic inflow uncertainty and variability are present (Suen et al., n.d. ; Yang and Cai, 2011 ). Understanding pertinent physical processes, including as flow states, sediment transport, and hydrodynamic characteristics for aquatic life within and downstream of reservoirs, will be necessary to mitigate tradeoffs among a dam's many functions (Wild and Loucks, 2014 ; Xu et al., 2017 ).   6 Nexus perspective towards SDGs SDGs are a set of 17 interconnected global objectives established by the UN, which covers environmental, economic, and social aspects of sustainable development. These goals, also known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development have 169 aims and 232 indicators to operationalize it and to measure progress towards achieving sustainable development outcomes by the year 2030. The adoption of the SDGs in 2015 marked a significant milestone in international efforts to achieve sustainable development. Nearly half of the goals have an environmental emphasis, and at least one aim relates to sustainable environment, as per the GEO-6 (2019) report by UNEP. All SDGs, apart from SDG10 (reduced inequalities), are linked to environmental sustainability in one way or the other (Pandey and Asif, 2022 ). A framework for directing nations in constructing an economical and environmentally safe future is provided by the UN SDGs (Wang et al., 2021 ). There is a need to include various trade-off and synergies intrinsic to the objectives in systems modeling by a comprehensive assessment of the 17 SDGs (Niet et al., 2021 ). Recent research on the SDGs has increasingly adopted an interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from multiple disciplines. This interdisciplinary perspective has facilitated a more comprehensive understanding of the interconnected nature of sustainable development challenges and opportunities. Researchers have utilized integrated assessment models, system dynamics simulations, and scenario analysis to assess the impacts of policy interventions and technological innovations on the FWE Nexus and its alignment with the SDGs. Research has highlighted the importance of considering regional variations in the implementation and impact of the SDGs. The SDGs helps to incorporate the complex impacts of an innovation on sustainable development (Castor et al., 2020 ; Eberling and Langkau, 2024 ). It is also crucial to note that progression towards tackling climate change, which is core of COP26 summit, is a roadmap to SDGs (Arora and Mishra, 2021 ). For instance, improved healthcare facilities (SDG 3), alleviating poverty (SDG 1), and ensuring a more sustainable and clean food and water supply are all influenced by rural energy access (SDG 2 & 6). However, if renewable energy is used to meet this demand rather than fossil fuel-fired power generation (SDG 7), fewer greenhouse gases (GHG) will be emitted, reducing climate change impact (SDG 13) and ameliorating security of energy, food & water supply. Sustainable consumption, increasing the effectiveness of resource use, and preventing food loss through recycling and reuse are all part of SDG 12. A number of the other SDGs, like SDG 13 on climate change, SDG 7 on cleaner and renewable energy sources, and SDG 2 on sustainable agriculture to end world hunger, are either directly or indirectly related to CE (Q. Zhang et al., 2022 ). SDGs 8, 9, 11, and 12 are directly related to CE, whereas SDGs 13 and 14 are indirectly related to CE (Dantas et al., 2021 ). The present urban water systems & the energy generation are growing due to the rising population, increasing the stress on the inland waters and existing land used for food production. Consequently, the environmental and socio-economic effects are gaining increased attention (Bieber et al., 2018 ). Fig. 6   represents various SDGs that are directly linked with the nexus strategies and therefore, are directly affected by implementation of nexus strategies. Various SDGs (SDGs 6, 7, 8, 11, 13 14, and 15) and their successful deployment significantly rely on sustainable management and energy, food, and water resource utilization. These variables not only interact, but they also promote and place restrictions on one another (Azad et al., 2015 ; Rasul, 2014 ; Weitz et al., 2017 ). The objectives are connected in a variety of ways. For instance, attaining aim of energy and water security necessary to guarantee that there is water and energy accessible for food production, is essential to reaching goal of food security and ending hunger. Like food production, processing, delivery, and use, achieving objective of water and energy security objectives will primarily depend on these practices (Rasul, 2016 ). The SDGs can be intricately linked together with COP26 Targets, much like the nexus of food, water, and energy, which are aligned with the broader SDGs set by the United Nations (Rasul, 2014 ). Thus, FEW nexus and SDGs should be addressed with an integrated approach to accomplish COP26 Targets. India, being a major developing country, has a crucial role to play in achieving COP26 targets. By aligning COP26 targets with relevant SDGs, a comprehensive and integrated approach can be created to address climate change while also advancing broader SDGs (Tzeremes et al., 2023 ). Table 1   summarizes the key SDGs and their indicators which are directly linked with nexus strategies. The goal to increase the share of renewable energy sources in its energy mix aligns with both COP26 goals and SDG 7, which focuses on affordable and clean energy for all. The steps taken for reducing carbon emissions, both in terms of total emissions and emissions per unit of economic output aligns with COP26's emphasis on emission reductions and SDG 13's focus on climate action (Wang et al., 2021 ). Implementing sustainable agricultural practices can help reduce emissions from agriculture and increase resilience to climate change impacts. This can accomplish both COP26 targets and SDG 2, which emphasizes zero hunger and sustainable farming (Finley and Seiber, 2014 ). Strengthening infrastructure, urban planning, and disaster resilience can help India cope with the impacts of climate change, which can help to achieve both COP26's adaptation goals and SDG 11's focus on sustainable cities and communities (Fao, n.d. ). Sustainable communities prioritize urban planning, infrastructure development, and community engagement initiatives and embrace circular economy principles by promoting resource conservation, waste reduction, and resource recovery. Integrated land-use planning, water recycling, and decentralized energy systems are examples of strategies that optimize resource utilization within sustainable communities (Nogueira et al., 2024 ). Efficient water management practices can enhance water security, which is crucial for coping with changing climate patterns. This aligns with COP26 goals and SDG 6's focus on clean water and sanitation. Educating the public about climate change and its impacts can lead to informed decisions and behavioral changes which is among COP26 goals and SDGs 4 (quality education) and 13 (climate action). International cooperation and partnerships are essential for achieving climate goals (Rasul, 2016 ). Nations can collaborate with organizations, and stakeholders to collectively address climate change, aligning with both COP26 and SDG 17. Implementing effective waste management strategies and promoting a circular economy can reduce emissions from waste and promote sustainability. This aligns with COP26 goals and SDG 12's focus on responsible consumption and production (Tzeremes et al., 2023 ). Fig. 7   is a demonstration of various approaches that can cater in the achievement of COP26 Targets while adopting nexus strategies. 6.1 Interconnectedness of Sustainable Development Goals with nexus In present years, there arises a need for aligning various sectors aiming towards sustainable development with an extended scope of dynamic changes in society. With the rising demands of natural resources, the implementation of SDGs may also induce increased demands for these resources (Bleischwitz et al., 2018 ). Thus arises a need for an integrated comprehensive approach involving interrelations of resource use and the human connections with the nature. Recent discussions on nexus approaches urge for adopting integrated transdisciplinary strategies addressing the interconnectedness. It requires active participation from the stakeholders to potentially recognize and regulate influence of human nature concerning the environment (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2021 ). Energy that is affordable, dependable, and modern can assist to alleviate malnutrition and boost food safety. In food production, constructing a broadly distributed power grid promotes agricultural modernization and upgrading, which can increase food production harvest and efficiency. Developing reasonably priced, clean energy to substitute high emitting and polluting conventional energy has benefits for environmental and human health (Bisaga et al., 2021 ). The burning of fossils emits significant quantities of contaminants such as NO2 , SO2  and PM, resulting in nearly 5.5 million deaths globally every year from “cardiovascular disease, respirational disease, hypertension and lung cancer” (Cook, 2011 ). Conventional sources of energy are typically generated through burning and necessitate the use of water for cooling equipment. Evolving clean-energy and increasing efficiency can decrease requirements for coolant and saving water. Furthermore, the development of new energy efficient systems can improve sustainability of water pumping, transport, and purifying services, thereby ensuring worldwide access to safe water for drinking. Addressing the challenges of energy pollution, poverty and backwardness supports cresting of CO2  in developing nations and upsurges national capacity for low-carbon and sustainable-development (Afsari Mamaghani et al., 2023 ). In long-run, SDG7 shows beginning of comprehensive substitute of conventional energy with low or zero carbon energy, as well as significant improvements in energy efficiency, paving “way for entire socioeconomic system to reach carbon neutrality and sustainable development” (Cameron et al., 2016 ). It is critical to underline that achieving SDG7 or energy-transition are unable to imply phasing out current arrangement without first examining its impact on entire chain and assets, as well as ability of new infrastructure to cover gaps. To preserve energy security, developing nations must make sensible judgements concerning their current fossil fuel-based infrastructure under carbon neutrality (Pan et al., 2023 ). Energy development and access creates jobs and supports economic and social development. Energy, economic structures and industrial, as well as employment patterns, are likely to go through swift variations during the low-carbon energy transition, providing new chances for a nation to reconfigure societal output and increase international competitiveness (Al-Muqdadi et al., 2021 ). Energy development stimulates industrial progress and infrastructure renewal. A substantial growth in share of renewable energy, for example, necessitates a faster transition from coal-based manufacturing units and investment in new infrastructure. In turn, a robust infrastructure is a critical requirement for energy production. Modern infrastructure that is digital and innovative technologies like big data and blockchain can boost energy innovation and efficiency while also facilitating universal access to modern energy facilities (Bisaga et al., 2021 ). To varying degrees, the utilization of conventional fuels contributes to urban pollution; for instance, traffic fuels affects the air quality. Advanced energy systems and decarbonization will help to encourage modernization of urban areas and inclusion, as well as reduce climate risks, improve air quality, and safeguard ecological balance (Pan et al., 2023 ). Also, delivering high aesthetic living facilities to urban people, popularizing low-carbon transit modes like electric vehicles and constructing safe and carbon neutral residential, business and commercial areas all require a stable and efficient power supply. Fig. 8   denotes potential integration aspects and key areas of focus for nexus and SDGs accomplishment. The vast consumption and production of fossil energy leads to environmental negligence, while relatively lesser energy efficiency of past contributes to energy waste. Fundamental adjustments in prior manufacturing and consumption practices are necessary to enable sustainable and responsible development. The criteria of the “UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Paris Accord” are really consistent with SDG13 (Cook, 2011 ). Energy is closely connected with climate change, according to bibliometric. Anthropogenic CO2  emission is leading contributor to global warming as well as unutilized methane gas produced from biodegradable waste is another GHG which is approx. 80 times effective than CO2 . Replacing fossil-based energy with non-fossil energy and significantly increase amount of renewable energy in energy mix are recognized as critical steps towards carbon neutrality and combating climate change and its consequences (Cameron et al., 2016 ).  6.2 Transdisciplinary FEW Nexus in SDG integration The interdisciplinary FEW nexus makes a notable contribution to the integrated achievement of these interconnected SDGs (Saladini et al., 2018 ). With an exponential increase in publications, the relevance of transdisciplinary perspectives has been apparent in the nexus literature (Ghodsvali et al., 2019 ). The integrative study of the FEW nexus and sustainable development has raised growing concerns in multidisciplinary nexus studies. Scientific discussions have deliberately combined environmental issues with social and political aspects of the FEW nexus (Gunnarsdottir et al., 2021 ). The exploration of roles played by various stakeholders in adopting sustainable innovations is aided by an awareness of the social structures and political context, which also serves as a crucial reflection on the necessary governance framework for nexus implementations (Halbe et al., 2015 ). Fig. 9   is a dynamic framework of different nexus phases leading to constructive solution for improvement of execution of nexus approaches.   7 Initiatives on the FEW nexus The nexus is a conceptually viable approach, but it has yet to be widely used to evaluate the relations between food, water, and energy or to promote the formulation of resource policies relevant to society and politics (Albrecht et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, there are few frameworks and models that cover food, water, and energy at same time (Shannak et al., 2018 ; Ali et al., 2023 ). Recent research has used techniques for ecosystem service mapping, such as Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs and Soil and Water Assessment Tool, to evaluate various environmental services (Alherbawi et al., 2021 ). International conferences, workshops, integrated study programs, and papers have shown an inclination towards the FEW nexus. The nexus is coming to the forefront of policymakers' concerns, especially given the post-2015 development goal. Several public-private collaborations related to nexus events are developing, and the business sector shows increased participation in nexus events. Private sector interest in water security has increased over the past ten years. This interest has been addressed as a new perspective of incorporate water management and is characterized by resource interconnections (Leck et al., 2015 ). Local businesses and Small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) are becoming more active in the nexus domain in addition to multinational corporations, usually in collaboration with public sector players. The Indonesian soybean processing industry is an example of SME-level nexus applications in agro-food industries. This sector has adopted nexus-oriented technologies for biogas and efficient use of energy. Reduced usage of firewood, GHG emissions, occupational illnesses, and enhanced wastewater treatment are also considered co-benefits [76]. Urban agriculture is a reliable approach for supplying communities with fresh food since the nutrients and water in household treated wastewater are important and can be reused. A study was conducted in the city of Hyderabad, India. The study reported 32 % less GHG emissions from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) as compared to untreated discharge of wastewater into the river bodies. This reduction was mainly due to the decrease in CH4  and N2 O during the treatment process. The field study results were effectively modelled using DAYCENT model. The outcomes show possible synergies significant challenges in FEW Nexus. The practice thus contributes to SDG 13 of action against climate change and COP26 target of reducing carbon emissions till 2030 (Miller-Robbie et al., 2017 ). Research conducted by (Ramaswami et al., 2017 ) created a structure to evaluate FEW nexus through perspective of urban system and quantifying environmental impacts of the nexus. The nexus of trans - border ground water and energy in agro-food production is considered to have a significant impact on overall GHG footprint of food, increasing it by 40 % above current emission concentration of transportation and agricultural production. Solutions for the sustainable allocation of water and land can simultaneously supply the needs for food and energy while ensuring ecological stability for future productivity. In another study conducted by (Correa-Cano et al., 2022 ), an integrated modeling framework for the sustainable agricultural FEW nexus was developed to maximize social welfare through water resource allocation, hydropower, and food crop production. The framework was able to create strategies for allocating water and land resources while considering the complicated and unpredictable environment. By providing clean energy, safe water, healthier meals, and sustainable management, these goals indirectly contributed to SDGs 3, 11, 12, and 15 while actively promoting SDGs 2, 6, 7, 8, and 13. Another study used China as a model and built an extended framework utilizing the Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) Model considering six SDGs (2, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 15). The findings suggested the need for increased focus on overcoming mutual inhibitions among particular sectors in future sustainability strategy and indicate that shifting the priority of management activities may turn trade-offs into synergies for the comprehensive achievement of the SDGs (Lazaro et al., 2021 ; P. Zhang et al., 2022 ; Biancardi et al., 2023 ) conducted a study taking the case of Brazil's sugarcane-ethanol. In this work, a qualitative analytical model links innovation, policy, labor, and governance as crucial elements in the biofuels' FEW nexus. The sector of ethanol that profited the maximum by its partnership with nation's research groups in significant innovations implemented to advance manufacturing methods and technique advancements in new products from sugarcane byproducts was determined by INNOVATION factor. The LABOR element demonstrates how important this is for the nexus method and how, in spite of acknowledging the connections between the FEW's three sectors, it still requires considering other inputs and factors like land, labor and soil into account. To demonstrate how nexus implementation can help comprehend trade-offs and co-benefits, identify the extent of political organization required, and recognize existing and possible alternatives to increase food, energy, and water resource management in area, (Mayor et al., 2015 ) presented a methodology for assessment of the implementation of the nexus and a tool to apply for Duero River Basin, Spain. The limitations faced by increased energy costs due to urbanization for irrigated land, the limits of water treatment, and the introduction of energy-related water needs are some of the most significant concerns highlighted in the study. (Sahle et al., 2019 ) conducted a study based on the FEW nexus, mapping and quantifying water-related ecosystem services and helping us better understand the seasonal pattern of runoff, the locations of high surface water resources, and rates of water discharge for various purposes at the watershed scale in Ethiopia. The study also emphasizes linkages between the demand and supply for ecosystem services like soil erosion control and water provision. The study uses this data to identify interconnected water-related concerns and management approaches for improving the security of the nexus, which can aid in managing water resources to increase the security of water, energy, and food. A model for bio economy was put up by (Venkatramanan et al., 2021 ) and included principles, stakeholders, and policies. The management of crop residues considered several variables, including climate change mitigation, sustainable agricultural practices, human health, and alternate methods for burning crop wastes. It was stated that avoiding crop residue burning can reduce toxic emissions, benefiting people's health and combat climate change. Crop residue burning alternatives assist in accomplishing SDG 3 and SDG 13. Burning crop residue contributes around 0.027 GtCO2  equivalents to GHG emissions (Islam Rony et al., 2023 ). Food waste management is also a critical component of FEW nexus and it aligns with several SDGs, including SDG2, SDG6, SDG7, SDG12, and SDG13. Various life cycle assessment studies have also been conducted on food waste with FEW nexus context. (Kibler et al., 2018 ) proposed a conceptual model for assessment of food supply chain and waste impact on nexus. The study suggested a need of quantitative assessment for management of food waste. In another study by (Wang et al., 2018 ), focusing on carbon emissions and cost analysis, nexus approach has been adopted for urban waste management. Multiple FEW-related benefits, including food production, energy savings, and water purification, are delivered from and to metropolitan areas through a strategic planning method termed as Green-Blue infrastructure (GBI). This promotes interconnectivity, adaptability, and assistance for wildlife and ecosystems while substantially affecting urban FEW systems (Alherbawi et al., 2021 ). GBI thus seems to be a reliable option for enhancing urban systems' sustainability. With the emphasis on achieving efficient water usage, renewable energy sources, and agricultural methods, the SDGs for energy, water and food (SDG2, SDG6, and SDG7) were targeted in this study (Meng et al., 2023 ). GBI has developed into a practical development to address nexus constraints for urban resilience in context of the FEW nexus and achieve the SDGs through adaptable and flexible implementations (Cristiano et al., 2021 ). The assessment of water-related environmental services increases energy and food security through management of water in addition to resolving water security challenges. Despite the ongoing studies on interrelationship between energy, food and water & the concept of ecological services has increased dramatically, very less studies have taken into consideration both the demand and supply for the services related to water ecosystems, which is essential for understanding the gap (Karabulut et al., 2016 ). This creates difficulties for researchers in presenting realistic land use planning techniques to address the dependencies between the food, water and energy sectors (Sahle et al., 2019 ). Since its adoption at United Nations 2011 Bonn Conference, significant initiatives were done in theoretical underpinnings and applied use of FEW nexus approaches to evaluate and effectively settle socio ecological concerns (Bazilian et al., 2011 ). If the viable strategies for the policy from various ministerial remits can connect with one another and form partnerships (SDG 17) to enhance synergies and coordinate goals, the goals of SDG 1, 2, 6, 7 and 15 can be accomplished more quickly (Kılkış et al., 2022 ; Melo et al., 2021 ). The integration of the nexus sectors may face economic (cost and investments and market distortions), physical (resource scarcity and infrastructure and technology gap), and political (institutional barriers and distributional impacts) challenges. Integrating Nexus sectors often requires significant upfront investments in infrastructure, technology, and capacity building. Also, economic incentives and market structures may not always align with nexus objectives, leading to market distortions. Physical constraints such as water scarcity, land degradation, and energy limitations can pose as a significant challenge. Inadequate infrastructure and technology gaps also affect nexus integration, particularly in rural or marginalized areas with limited access to basic services. Inadequate infrastructure and technology gaps, particularly in rural or marginalized areas with limited access to basic services are another barrier in incorporating nexus approaches while addressing distributional impacts. The potential to explore the interactions between elements from in an individual framework for all the sectors an opportunity to address these challenges (Avraam et al., 2021 ). In order to study expanding strategic choices, the FEW-nexus system's framework provides a model where interrelationships between FEW nexus structures are also evaluated (Namany et al., 2019 ). All methods, however, rely on data that is accessible across all three sectors and consistent throughout their interrelatedness. The difficulty of compiling such datasets restricts the nexus's application to real-world issues (Krajačić et al., 2018 ). The collection of precise data and creation of reliable information production processes are required by the increased regional downscaling and improved technological detail (Simpson and Jewitt, 2019 ). (Gupta, 2019 ) performed a study on the solar water pumps for the districts of Rajasthan. Results obtained revealed that solar water pumps had positive impact on baseline consumption pattern of the districts. The baseline consumption for electricity reduced up to 40 % crop intensity also increased up to 10 % thus marking a substantial effect on the FEW nexus by integrating solar water pumps. (Guan et al., 2020 ) modelled and quantified the interaction between the FEW nexus in the Arizona using WEAP platform (Water Evaluation and Planning). The results showed that a decreasing pattern of water demand in agricultural sector will reduce consumption of underground water usage which would result in safe discharge by aquifer and thereby increased percentage of solar power reduce the demand for energy by 2 %. (Tabatabaie and Murthy, 2021 ) conducted a study using input output model for quantification of interconnectedness of nexus sectors. The results through optimization showed the potential of reducing the environmental and cost-reduction impacts only sometimes proved to be feasible. However, it can assist decision makers in formulating the policies for long-term to alleviate environmentally and cost implications (Villicaña-García and Ponce-Ortega, 2019 ). Safe and sustainable handling of resources can be proven cost-effective methods with net economic and environmental gain (Shahbaz et al., 2023 ). This has become the need for the present scenario which is required to achieve targets set by national and international organizations (Sridhar et al., 2021 ). Table 2   summarizes the quantified impacts of various nexus strategies adopted and their impacts on SDGs.  8 COP27 through FEW nexus lens In recent years, transforming the food system is considered among prime development priority for improving nutrition, production and lifestyle, without leaving anyone behind (Gunnarsdottir et al., 2021 ; Wiegleb and Bruns, 2018 ). This is due to the ongoing risk of climate change mitigation along with economic fluctuations, increasing disparities and tension in international relations. In recent report of SDGs, the emphasis was laid on need to implement urgent actions to deal with climate risks to make significant contributions to eliminate hunger, achieving nutrition security as well as encouraging sustainable farming practices by 2030 (Gebara and Laurent, 2023 ; van Soest et al., 2019 ). The present SDG indicators lack the linkages to connect other SDGs, which could have the potential to enhance the rate of SDG achievement. The participating nations at COP27 attempted to bridge the implementation gap, identifying ways to reduce GHG emissions; adapt to predicted effects of climate change; increase funding; resilient technology and infrastructure for combating climate crisis and promoting collaborative efforts and strategies (Naidoo et al., 2021 ; Yue et al., 2021 ). The following actions have become priority after being highlighted as a consequence of COP27 with five key elements (availability, utilization, access, sustainability and stability) (Allan et al., 2015 ; Biggs et al., 2015 ):• Localization of food by at least 30 % by 2030 to minimize the dependence on imports and cater the fluctuation in food supply due by climate risks, price changes, policy shifts, and wars.  • Support digitalization and technology innovation for climate mitigation for cut down of carbon emission and efficient working of supply chains.  • Incentivizing small farms by giving money and credit for practicing climate-friendly methods to enhance sustainable agriculture techniques and nutritious food.  • Help plant-based food production system scale up to increase low-emission methods and provide economic and health advantages with low cost to the environment.  • Getting more people involved in creating a diversified and sustainable nexus strategies on all three levels (environmental, economic, and social).  • Creating awareness about sustainable and energy efficient strategies that can help to achieve COP26 targets and thus accomplishing SDGs and bridge the execution gap.  • Adoption of nexus strategies to inculcate and utilize the local natural resources.    Fig. 10   shows the status of achievement of different SDGs.  9 Conclusion The alignment and quantification of the nexus strategies with SDGs are being focused on the linked benefit sharing mainly local and global impact. Ensuring waste reduction and resource sustainability, FEW nexus and CE are fast adapting approaches emerging predominantly. However, despite the potential benefits of nexus integration, several limitations and challenges must be addressed to realize its full potential. Due to various constraints in execution of the research on a larger scale, the impact has been limited to local area accounting to issues like implementation, execution, governance and insubstantial policies. These include data gaps and methodological challenges, interdisciplinary integration barriers, policy implementation gaps, inclusivity and equity concerns, and measurement and evaluation issues. The objectives related to FEW nexus should take into account interactions among nexus sectors that can be tracked at various levels, undertake comprehensive research and policy initiatives at both national and regional levels, to maximize advantages for both society and nature. The governance in nexus needs continued development, and institutional advancements demand a longer time horizon for successful implementation. Future studies should prioritize interdisciplinary approach that bridge the gap between social, economic and environmental aspects. The impediments to effective execution of nexus strategies could be tackled by their involvement in planning strategies and domain-centric pathways. While there are challenges ahead, the FEW nexus remains a promising framework for integrating and managing core environmental verticals such as sustainable energy and circular economy in compliance with the SDGs and COP26 & COP27 targets. By building on existing knowledge and addressing key limitations, future studies can have the transformative potential of the FEW nexus in advancing sustainability and resilience across food, energy, and water systems.
