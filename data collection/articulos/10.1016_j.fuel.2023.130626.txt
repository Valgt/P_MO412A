                  Green ammonia produced from renewable sources with little to no carbon emissions is considered as a carbon-free energy. Specifically, ammonia is an attractive energy carrier because of its high energy density, comparatively low-cost, and ease of liquefaction and storage. Ammonia generated worldwide is being used majorly as fertilizer however, in recent days, it has drawn more interest as a potential energy source and direct fuel in three key sectors namely electricity, transport, and heating. However, using green ammonia in diverse sectors has numerous challenges and limitations. Thus, this review aims to address the significance and application of green ammonia in the hydrogen energy sector and techno hurdles and environmental impact assessment of green ammonia utilization. At the outset, the importance of green ammonia and its utilization as a hydrogen energy carrier, the Power-to-ammonia-to-power (P2A2P) system, and the role of green ammonia in the Sustainable Development Goals were critically discussed. In the succeeding chapter, green ammonia's technological obstacles and its environmental impact were extensively articulated with state-of-the-art articles to lay a roadmap for decarbonizing the environment/energy sector by successfully utilizing ammonia as a hydrogen energy carrier/carbon-free green energy.

Increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources represents a highly promising avenue for attaining the desired objective. According to recent research, the cost of electricity derived from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass has been steadily declining. This may be attributed to the implementation of government regulations and significant improvements in related technology. As a result, it is anticipated that RES will play a significant role in power generation, surpassing conventional sources, by the year 2025 [ 123,124 ]. Nevertheless, the implementation of RES encounters challenges attributed to the inconsistent power supply they offer. In in this scenario, ammonia received global interest in recent decades. Japan has actively sought renewable alternatives to meet its energy consumption needs. One potential solution that has garnered attention is the use of ammonia as a carrier for hydrogen-based energy. To further explore this possibility, a consortium consisting of 22 members, led by Tokyo Gas, has been established to develop and promote “Green Ammonia.” This initiative is supported by the Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Programme (SIP) of Japan [ 125 ]. Green Ammonia Decoupled device developed by UK aims to demonstrate the conversion of wind energy into ammonia for the purpose of storage and subsequent release through an internal combustion engine [ 126 ]. The utilisation of ammonia in the transportation industry is subject to political influence and its role may undergo transformations. A recent development in Australia involves the establishment of a new branch of the NH 3 Fuel Association, facilitated by the cooperation of industrial entities engaged in the production of ammonia and hydrogen. The Australian chapter aims to engage individuals and enterprises from Singapore, Malaysia, and New Zealand in order to enhance the recognition of the chemical compound, ammonia, and elevate its prominence in the fields of energy storage and power generation [ 127 ]. The projects implemented in Australia demonstrate that, in the event of effective implementation, these programmes have the potential to fully substitute natural gas usage through the production of hydrogen and ammonia. Moreover, the nation is actively engaged in the process of incorporating ammonia into the global market, both in terms of its integration into the international market and its involvement in renewable fuel production [ 128 ]. The Netherlands is at the forefront of promoting ammonia among mainland European nations. The justification for this assertion is that the Netherlands has a significant abundance of renewable resources due to huge investments made by both the government and industry. Hence, ammonia emerges as an energy carrier with the capacity to meet the nation's present energy requirements, while enabling production businesses to export surplus power and, subsequently, ammonia through advanced batteries that will supply the station by the timeframe of 2023–2030 [ 129 ].   https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-017 https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-037

Specifically, ammonia is an attractive energy carrier because of its high energy density, comparatively low-cost, and ease of liquefaction and storage. Ammonia generated worldwide is being used majorly as fertilizer however, in recent days, it has drawn more interest as a potential energy source and direct fuel in three key sectors namely electricity, transport, and heating. However, using green ammonia in diverse sectors has numerous challenges and limitations. Thus, this review aims to address the significance and application of green ammonia in the hydrogen energy sector and techno hurdles and environmental impact assessment of green ammonia utilization. At the outset, the importance of green ammonia and its utilization as a hydrogen energy carrier, the Power-to-ammonia-to-power (P2A2P) system, and the role of green ammonia in the Sustainable Development Goals were critically discussed. In the succeeding chapter, green ammonia's technological obstacles and its environmental impact were extensively articulated with state-of-the-art articles to lay a roadmap for decarbonizing the environment/energy sector by successfully utilizing ammonia as a hydrogen energy carrier/carbon-free green energy.

Fossil fuel combustion leads to numerous problems like health issues and climate change etc. [1] . Anthropogenic events including the combustion of fossil fuels emit huge amounts of CO2  by over 40 % since pre-industrial times [2] . In addition to CO2 , methane is now available in ample amounts in the atmosphere than at any point in the last 650,000 years [3] , and increase in the methane content and climate change are due to anthropogenic activities. The climate change conference held in December 2018 at Katowice stated that the increase in GHG concentration is connected increase in the surface temperature of the earth [4] . To reduce GHG emissions, many countries have started taking incentive measures to encourage the replacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy sources (RES). In this regard, renewable energy sources are the best way to regulate climatic issues since it is sustainable fuel with no/minimal environmental impact [5] . The most commonly used renewable sources are wind and solar, however, using energy storage system is viable selection to govern the sustainable energy supply such as methanol, ammonia, hydrazine as hydrogen energy carriers [6] . Hydrogen is a clean and flexible energy source, and ammonia is an effective carrier of hydrogen. Hydrogen may be stored and transported using green ammonia, which helps to solve some of the problems with hydrogen distribution and storage. Of the various hydrogen energy carriers, ammonia derived from renewable sources offers various benefits such as ease of transport and storage [7,8] . After H2 SO4 , the second-most manufactured chemical is ammonia with 235 million tonnes globally in 2019 [9] . It is primarily used to produce fertilizer in the agriculture industries and also for a variety of other purposes, such as energy carriers for storage and transportation [10] . Green ammonia is referred to as ammonia produced utilising sustainable production practises and renewable energy sources with little to no carbon emissions. One of the most significant chemical products used for making fertilizers and other chemicals is ammonia. With an annual production of more than 200 million tonnes, NH3  production contributes significantly to the world economy. The groundbreaking Haber-Bosch process was followed to synthesize ammonia where pure H2  and N2  are allowed to react at high pressure and temperature for an industrial production of NH3 . Specifically, ammonia is attractive as an energy carrier because of its high-energy density, comparatively low-cost, and ease of liquefaction and storage and further, ammonia also has easier access to international shipping infrastructure and poses fewer security risks than hydrogen [11] . Since 95 % of the hydrogen used to make ammonia comes from fossil fuels, which emits 420 million tonnes/year of CO2 , and the current global production of ammonia is 200 million tonnes/year [12] . By 2050, it is anticipated that this will rise to about 270 Mtonne/year of ammonia, considering the population expansion [12] . Currently, 80 % of the ammonia generated worldwide is being utilized as fertiliser [13] . Ammonia has, however, drawn more interest recently as a potential energy source and direct fuel for use in the three other sectors (electricity, transport, and heating [12] . The advantage of using ammonia is it has a higher octane rating ie.,17.8 hydrogen and thus, it will be thermally degraded to release H2 , which serves as a competent hydrogen energy carrier for both mobile and stationary applications [14] . Ammonia is a safe energy while comparing to H2  as it has a narrow flammability, which decreases the explosion risk and notably, as it is a low dense fuel, it dissipates quickly into the surrounding atmosphere [12] . Ammonia has a low-cost of storage while comparing to alternative one and is also far denser and smaller in footprint than an equivalent in compressed H2 /batteries [15] . Various applications are possible when using ammonia as a fuel. Ammonia can be utilized as a fuel in chemical processes and technologies that transform chemical energy to heat and electricity. In addition, as fuel, it can be used in furnaces, gas turbines, rockets, and internal combustion engines. Many companies are working on an ammonia-based low-carbon economy by investing in establishing novel technologies as stated by the Ammonia Energy Association. Ammonia is reported to be an appropriate energy for power production and marine applications [16,17] . As a recent development, ammonia/hydrogen-fuelled vehicles are established with the use of carbon-free hybrid system where electrochemical ammonia splitting was sued to produce hydrogen [18] . Though green ammonia produced from renewable sources is considered as a green and viable alternative fuel for the future [19] ; there are numerous obstacles to be addressed to introduce green ammonia in the current global energy mix. Scaling up of ammonia needs large infrastructure and capital investment, cost of the Haber process (hydrogen and nitrogen), green ammonia yield percentage is very small considering the present-day demand, and industrial-scalability. In toto, techno-economic, social, and environmental constraints are taken in account towards the commercialization of green ammonia. That is why, in this review, the application, significance, and techno-economic challenges in green ammonia production was critically reviewed. Utilization of ammonia for hydrogen energy carrier or energy carrier, Power-to-ammonia-to-power (P2A2P) system, Sustainable development Goals in green ammonia perspective, obstacles in green ammonia utilization, technological hurdles and environmental impact of green ammonia with the support of state-of-the-art articles was extensively articulated.  2 Green ammonia as an energy carrier Concerns about existing energy systems' dependence on fossil fuels have increased the need for green alternative fuels to create a carbon-free and ecofriendly energy generation and utilization in the future [20] . Green hydrogen is widely regarded as a vital strategy for addressing the challenges posed by climate change [21] . The renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, hydro, geothermal, tidal and so on vary in intensity across the globe [22] . For instance, near the equator, direct normal sun radiation is stronger. Energy storage techniques will be crucial in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems because they will increase the need for electricity storage to meet rising demand. Transporting renewable energy from high-intensity regions to low-intensity regions has been difficult, but liquid fuels made from renewable energy sources may provide a solution [23] . The schematic illustration depicting the various stages in hydrogen energy transport through ammonia is given in Fig. 1  .  Though green hydrogen produced by water electrolysis has been touted as the future fuel, its storage, and transportation are the major challenges for the effective implementation [21] . The transportation of green hydrogen from economically viable renewable electricity centers to regions lacking such resources necessitates the transformation of gaseous hydrogen into a liquid form with high energy density [24] . 2.1 Hydrogen energy carriers Liquid hydrogen (LH2 ), liquid ammonia (LNH3 ), and organic hydrides like methylcyclohexane (MCH) have all been proposed as possible liquid carriers of hydrogen energy. Ammonia, as a hydrogen energy carrier, exhibits a gravimetric H2  density of 17.8 wt%, surpassing that of MCH by approximately threefold. where the gravimetric H2  density achievable with liquid H2  is 100 wt%. Several studies have been conducted to compare various carriers, with a primary focus on energy efficiency and cost [25] . The cost of converting and transporting hydrogen in various forms, such as liquid hydrogen, MCH, and ammonia, was outlined in the IEA's report on the future of hydrogen energy. The most cost-effective transportation choice was seen to exhibit a significant correlation with local and international modes. The costs associated with carrier synthesis indicate that ammonia and hydrogen are comparatively more expensive than MCHs. Additionally, MCHs and, to a lesser extent, ammonia exhibit substantial reconversion costs. The predicted overall conversion losses for the production of carriers and the release of hydrogen were found to be 25–35 % for LH2  and 35–40 % for MCH. The anticipated conversion loss for ammonia was found to be between 7 % and 18 %, while the reconversion back to H2  resulted in a loss of less than 20 %. Consequently, the overall efficiency of the process was between 27 % and 38 %. This implies that there is minimal disparity among the carrier alternatives. The findings of a study revealed that the total efficiency of power generation through direct combustion or fuel cells is comparable across all three choices [26] . Furthermore, it has been determined that the utilization of ammonia in a direct ammonia fuel cell and the reduction of energy consumption during the liquefaction process of LH2  from 15 kWh/kg to 9 kWh/kg could potentially result in overall efficiencies of 46 % and 45 %, respectively [27] . In addition, green ammonia has been identified as a highly appealing hydrogen and energy carrier among liquid H2  and methylcyclohexane (MCH) [28] . This is due to its high energy efficiency compared to other materials such as green liquid H2  and methylcyclohexane (MCH). Specifically, the reported energy efficiencies for green liquid H2 , MCH, and green ammonia are 65.7, 61.7, and 67.8, respectively. These materials are used for transporting green energy to Japan. Moreover, with this mode of transportation, the carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant as a result of the complete utilization of renewable energy sources. The grey ammonia-based carriers have CO2  emissions of 100 %, whereas the blue ammonia-based carriers have CO2  emissions of 50 %. Carbon capture storage is employed to mitigate emissions from blue ammonia, resulting in significantly reduced emissions [29,30] . The cost of converting hydrogen gas to MCH is $0.6 per kilogram of H2 , which is relatively high when compared to the cost of converting hydrogen to ammonia [31] . The cost of hydrogen energy carriers, including liquid hydrogen (green), ammonia (green), CH3 OH, LOHC, and LCH4 , for shipment from Morocco to Germany is reported as 126, 124, 131, 156, and 145 €/MWhLHV,  respectively. Additional details are given in Table 1  . This demonstrates the superiority of ammonia compared to other energy carriers. Regarding the comprehensive integration of heat in the dehydrogenation process using a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), it was projected that the utilisation of methylcyclohexane (MCH) might yield an efficiency of 38 % [41] . According to the assessments conducted on the three carriers, it is anticipated that there will be minimal disparities in the expenses incurred by 2030 and 2050 [42] . From the potential electricity generation from wind farms and photovoltaics through the production of MCH and ammonia, the overall energy efficiencies were found to be between 15.5 % and 14.5 % of the initial energy being recovered as electric power [43] . A cost analysis of various carriers for an energy trading link between Patagonia and Japan, focusing on the utilisation of LH2 , emphasised that the process of decomposing ammonia for hydrogen applications incurs a substantial energy cost, particularly when combined with compression losses in the case of on-vehicle storage [44] . The absence of extensive infrastructure poses a significant obstacle to the widespread adoption of LH2 . Consequently, the establishment of a comprehensive infrastructure for large-scale storage and transportation of liquid hydrogen would be imperative. Although ammonia and MCH are seemingly more straightforward options for implementation, the toxicity concerns associated with ammonia and toluene/MCH pose challenges within the setting of a highly populated country such as Japan [45] . The utilisation of ammonia as a direct means of energy transmission shows great potential, as its energy content on a lower heating value (LHV) basis is comparable to that of liquid hydrogen. The argument in favour of utilising ammonia becomes considerably less persuasive when considering the necessity of converting it back into hydrogen [29] . Nevertheless, ammonia possesses some advantages in terms of transportation, drawing from its ease of shipment, extensive industrial utilisation, and the potential to capitalise on established supply chain technology and infrastructure. Consequently, these factors contribute to a more expedited implementation of ammonia as an energy carrier [23] . Although the current infrastructure enables the transportation of substantial volumes of liquid petroleum products globally, it is worth noting that MCH (methylcyclohexane) stands out as the costliest and least efficient medium for hydrogen transportation. Moreover, this substance is considered hazardous and has been prohibited in the European Union. The energy demand associated with the liberation of hydrogen is a significant obstacle to its viability as a hydrogen carrier [46] . 2.1.1 Ammonia as a hydrogen energy carrier Ammonia possesses a notable energy density and hydrogen concentration, rendering it a fuel source devoid of carbon emissions. Additionally, this chemical compound holds significant importance in various applications including fertilisers production and energy generation. In order to enhance the efficiency of energy transportation, scholars have conducted investigations into the utilisation of ammonia as an energy carrier through both electrochemical and thermochemical approaches. These approaches encompass various technologies such as fuel cells [9] , internal combustion engines [47,48] , and gas turbines [49] . Numerous studies have proposed and examined various multi-generation systems that utilise green hydrogen or ammonia as an energy carrier, due to their potential in achieving a low-carbon environment and facilitating cross-sector decarbonization. These systems are considered advantageous in terms of their ability to address environmental concerns. The interest in green ammonia as an energy carrier is increasing, as it has been recognised as a crucial technology for reducing carbon emissions across several sectors. This recognition is evident in recent studies from various international bodies and industry, which highlight green ammonia as a critical emphasis [48,50–52] . The current progress in reducing carbon emissions in the shipping industry through the use of environmentally friendly ammonia demonstrates the numerous benefits of ammonia that can also be applied to large-scale power generation [23,53] . Projections about the utilisation of ammonia as a fuel for shipping vary from 25 % to 99 % of the total worldwide maritime fuel by the year 2050 [54,55] . This presents the possibility of becoming the most cost-effective zero-carbon choice for various companies involved in marine transportation, so aiding in the overall reduction of carbon emissions [17,53] . Furthermore, this approach integrates renewable power generation, biomass chemical-looping ammonia production, and direct ammonia fuel cells. Biomass-to-ammonia-to-power (B2A2P) is a versatile method for carbon emission reduction that can be applied in various industries [49] . This is achieved through the integration of renewable energy, chemical looping combustion of biomass, and ammonia power generation. The cross-sector decarbonisation element of combined renewable B2A2P (CRBS) involves the substitution of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources and ammonia in the electricity and heat sectors, as well as the replacement of fossil fuels with biomass and renewable electricity in the industrial sector. Thermodynamic assessments have been performed on a range of systems that utilise hydrogen and ammonia [56] , encompassing diverse strategies for the synthesis, storage, and utilisation of green hydrogen and ammonia. A sustainable multi-generation system may rely on solar and wind energy to offer power, heating, cooling, and water desalination services to isolated regions. In order to maintain uninterrupted operation, both thermal energy and hydrogen storage systems, specifically water electrolysis and hydrogen combustor can be employed. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the system is found to be 50 % and 34 % correspondingly [57] . Green hydrogen is utilised for ammonia synthesis in an ammonia-based system without the need for storage. Additionally, ammonia-fed solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are employed to address any potential electricity deficits [58] . The range of overall energy efficiency seen was between 46.1 % and 53.3 %, whereas the range of overall exergy efficiency observed was between 34 % and 41.5 %. Several previous research have put forth the concept of multi-generation systems that incorporate various renewable energy sources including geothermal power [59] . Additionally, these studies have explored alternative techniques for producing green hydrogen, as well as the utilisation of hydrogen and ammonia [60,61] , besides the integration of these systems [62] . The aforementioned research collectively demonstrates the technical viability of systems utilising hydrogen and ammonia. The investigation of ammonia's decomposition and direct energy conversion is crucial in the context of its utilisation as an energy carrier. The pace at which LNH3  decomposes is influenced by various factors, including the partial pressure, flow rate, operating temperatures, and the materials used for the anode [63,64] . The lack of maturity in the technological development of ammonia decomposition poses a significant constraint on its utilization as an energy carrier. This assertion holds particular validity when contrasted with the level of development attained by the long-standing procedures employed in ammonia production, management, and distribution, which have undergone extensive optimization spanning a century [29] . The primary obstacle in the advancement of CO2 -free hydrogen technology lies in effectively combining ammonia decomposition and hydrogen purification in a manner that is both energy-efficient and reliable, while also allowing for scalability. The conversion rate of ammonia often exhibits a declining trend as the fuel flow rate increases, which can lead to contrasting trends in power density. The power density can be increased by supplying a greater amount of hydrogen while the fuel flow rate is low. Nevertheless, when the fuel flow rate reaches a specific threshold, the excessive flow rate causes the decomposed hydrogen to be removed, leading to a reduction in power density [64,65] . Possible study fields encompass the advancement of catalysis, the development of methods for purifying H2 , and the design of reactors [66] . The process of ammonia decomposition is influenced by temperature, and the complete breakdown of ammonia can be attained within a temperature range of 450–800 °C when an anodic catalyst is present [67,68] . Furthermore, the presence of a catalyst plays a significant role. The catalytic component typically consists of a metallic material, which plays a crucial role in facilitating the catalytic processes of ammonia breakdown and hydrogen oxidation. Currently, there have been reports on the existence of noble metals, non-noble metals, bimetals, transition metal carbides, and nitrides. In the process of ammonia breakdown, Ruthenium (Ru) now holds the distinction of being the metal with the most notable catalytic activity. The potential of other catalysts can be arranged in the following order: Nickel (Ni) > Rhodium (Rh) > Cobalt (Co) > Iridium (Ir) > Iron (Fe) > Platinum (Pt) > Chromium (Cr) > Palladium (Pd) > Copper (Cu) [69] . Nevertheless, the element Ru is classified as a noble metal, which presents significant financial challenges when it comes to its economic viability. Nickel (Ni) is an economically affordable metal that exhibits a notable ability to decompose ammonia. Reports show that the best range for the nitrogen binding energy of catalysts for breaking down ammonia is between 544 and 586 kJ mol−1 [70] . The development of ammonia production under moderate conditions has seen significant advancements in many catalytic processes, including electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, photo-electrocatalytic, and bio-catalytic methods. Catalysts play a significant part in all of these processes [71] . Multiple studies have documented the performance of diverse catalysts, encompassing their Faraday efficiency (FE). The analysis of electrocatalysts, categorised by Nobel metals, transition metals, non-metals, main group metals, nitric oxide reduction reactions (NORR), and nitride oxide reduction reactions (NtrRR), reveals that catalysts of the NtrRR type have the highest recorded FE of 82–100 [72] . The utilisation of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic techniques, employing low-carbon fossil fuels, is now being contemplated as prospective avenues for advancing ammonia production. Extensive research efforts are currently underway to investigate the production of heterostructures and the modification of various photocatalysts, including as porous metal–organic frameworks, nanoclusters, and black phosphorus. Researchers are currently engaged in developing catalysts with enhanced precision and methodological approach in order to attain a significant advancement in both activity and selectivity. Heteroatom doping, vacancy engineering research, frustrated Lewis pairs, heterojunction construction, and cocatalyst loading for photo-electrocatalyst ammonia synthesis have gained significant attention in recent years [73] . Moreover, it has been observed that photo-assisted electrocatalysis demonstrates enhanced efficiency in comparison to solitary electrocatalysis. The field of bio-catalysis is experiencing increased attention and progress as a result of advancements in bio-catalysts. Enzymes have been employed as catalysts in the field of biocatalysis for the purpose of synthesising ammonia from amino acids. It is worth mentioning that there have been notable developments in the field of enzyme creation, namely in the area of converting 13 distinct amino acids into ammonia [74,75] . In addition, the use of yeast expressing the enzyme HcLAAO can enable the effective synthesis of ammonia from food waste. In the past few years, numerous technologies have been assessed with regard to the application of green ammonia. Transition metals, including Fe, Co, and Ni, exhibit catalytic activity for the decomposition of ammonia to hydrogen exclusively at temperatures exceeding 600 °C. In recent studies, substantial enhancements in conversion efficiency have been exhibited at temperatures in the vicinity of 550 °C through the dispersion of carbon nanotubes, transition metal nanoparticles, and nanofibers within an alumina matrix [76] . Diverse types of fuel cells that convert power directly are gaining in popularity. SOFC utilising ammonia operates at elevated temperatures (500–1000 °C). Ammonia cracking and power generation are consolidated at such elevated temperatures [77,78] . Such FCs are relatively inexpensive, since a distinct ammonia breakdown unit is unnecessary. It may therefore be a viable option for the production of electricity using renewable ammonia. Moreover, within the marine industry, the absence of space constraints enables the utilisation of ammonia as fuel for marine engines equipped with adequate NOx reduction apparatus [17] . Presently, the utilisation of ammonia-fuelled turbines for large-scale power generation is an emerging technology. The purification of hydrogen generated by the breakdown of ammonia is necessary for numerous applications [79] . One effective approach involves employing multifunctional H2 -permeable membrane reactors, which combine the processes of reaction, separation, and purification within a singular apparatus, hence presenting numerous benefits [80,81] . The first advantage is that it produces pure hydrogen and achieves complete conversion at lower temperatures by manipulating the thermodynamic equilibrium through the continuous extraction of hydrogen. This leads to improved system efficiency. The second advantage is that it eliminates the need for downstream separation units, resulting in reduced installation and operational expenses [81,82] . Palladium membranes have been extensively studied and evaluated for various applications, such as ammonia decomposition, making them the most favourable choice for meeting purity standards [83,84] . The stability of Pd membranes in ammonia has been demonstrated, however, the future development and scaling up of H2-membrane technologies remain as problems that require further investigation [85] . The primary limitations that hinder the extensive use of Pd-based membranes are associated with the high cost of Pd, as well as the fragility and durability of the membranes. In addition, it is imperative that the membranes exhibit a defect-free structure and possess exceptional high-temperature sealing capabilities in order to get the desired level of hydrogen (H2 ) purity, as indicated by reference [86] . Future research in the field of H2  separation and purification systems employing H2 -permeable membranes is primarily focused on addressing the challenges associated with limited membrane lifetime and inadequate resistance to thermal cycling. In order for membrane-based technology to be considered competitive for this response on a broader scale, it is imperative to showcase substantial advancements [84,85] . The significance of reactor technology in the process of ammonia breakdown is of equal importance, as reactors are susceptible to both mechanical and thermal constraints. Microstructure reactors, characterised by their elevated surface area-to-volume ratios, exhibit advantageous attributes such as enhanced rates of heat and mass transfer, simplified separation processes, increased durability, and reduced H2  inhibition of decomposition rates. These factors collectively contribute to the improvement of conversion efficiency [87] . The performance of microreactors composed of graphite-coated silica, silicon carbide, or alumina was evaluated in terms of NH3  decomposition. The results indicated that these microreactors exhibited superior activity per unit volume compared to traditional reactors. Microchannel reactors possess a lesser volume and weight compared to monoliths, making them more convenient for scaling up. Membrane reactors are surpassed by the current development phase of the aforementioned technology, which exhibits a notable increase in conversion efficiency at moderate temperatures [88] . Moreover, it has significant prospects for the advancement of NH3  decomposition technology [89] . Additional research is required to examine the durability and resilience of the subject in dynamic situations, specifically in relation to numerous start-up and shutdown cycles that are commonly seen in real-world operations. A comprehensive evaluation of a freestanding hybrid renewable energy system utilising ammonia as energy carriers, along with hydrogen fuel cells and a battery bank, has demonstrated the potential to accomplish complete renewable energy integration with a cost of 0.203 USD/kWh [90] . A further case study was carried out on a university campus, wherein a hybrid system comprising of photovoltaic (PV) cells, gas-fired trigeneration, and hydrogen production, connected to the grid, demonstrated a levelized cost of energy ranging from 0.061 to 0.065 USD/kWh [91] . According to the findings of the reviewed research, the cost disparity in transporting ammonia via ship to various destinations ranges from 380 to 13,630 USD per tonne. Furthermore, the levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA), normalised to 2020 is also reported between 470 and 617 USD per tonne [92] . Despite the considerable emphasis placed on research and development in several technological domains over the past decade, there remains a pressing need for significant advancements in reducing costs and enhancing efficiency of ammonia-related technologies, particularly in relation to its use as a feasible energy carrier. The primary focal points encompass carbon-free ammonia production, sustainable technologies for alternative renewable pathways of hydrogen production, the establishment of efficient and scalable methodologies for hydrogen retrieval from ammonia, the implementation of effective purification systems for H2 , the advancement of membranes that satisfy hydrogen criteria, mechanical strength, durability, thermal stability, and chemical stability while maintaining low production costs. In addition, there is a need for the development of dependable and financially feasible power generation systems that utilise ammonia as either a direct or indirect source of fuel. This necessitates the advancement of safety technologies, transportation technologies, cost estimating systems, and exhaust emission mitigation systems [66] . The societal endorsement of ammonia as a viable and environmentally friendly energy medium is crucial in order to advance the utilisation of this technology in decentralised applications.    3 Application of green ammonia in the energy sector Fig. 2   presents the global production of ammonia per year. The energy requirements of a society that aims to be carbon-free in the future are contingent upon the utilisation of renewable energy sources. This is crucial in order to tackle the issues related to energy security, while also mitigating the adverse environmental consequences connected with energy producing processes [23,48] . In the present paradigm shift, the capacity to efficiently store and disseminate substantial amounts of energy is imperative for guaranteeing both security and adaptability [29] . The preference for chemical storage in energy-dense fuels, such as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and cyclohexane, lies in their ability to store significant amounts of energy over extended durations and facilitate extensive distribution. In contrast, electrical storage methods, such as batteries, are more suitable for short-term and localised energy storage. The primary advantages of ammonia in energy sector include its significant volumetric and gravimetric energy density, as well as its comparatively cheaper cost per unit of stored energy in comparison to hydrogen [93] . In addition, NH3 can undergo catalytic decomposition to produce hydrogen without CO2  emissions [94,95] . Alternatively, NH3 can be utilised directly in power generation technologies such as fuel cells, combustion engines, and gas turbines, resulting in a carbon–neutral operation. Moreover, NH3  benefits from an established production and distribution infrastructure, accompanied by clearly defined regulations and a commendable safety record [96] . Well-established infrastructure for producing ammonia includes pipelines, bunker shipping, and tank trucks, among other transportation methods [29] . The inclusion of NH3  in the development of future energy systems is receiving considerable attention due to its notable characteristics and potential as an energy carrier for H2 [29,48,94,97] . Energy security constitutes a critical component of the economic policies of all countries. This issue holds significant importance in the realm of socio-economics, as it impacts energy producers and consumers alike. By reducing reliance on fossil fuels and serving as a green energy source of the future, green ammonia possesses the capability to enhance the energy security of numerous nations by diversifying their supplies [98] . In terms of energy security, ammonia safety management systems, cost, and dependable supply are, nevertheless, the most critical factors in ensuring that this transition occurs. Concerning the application of ammonia in the energy sector and energy security, the market faces the following obstacles: a discrepancy between market development and policy declarations; comparatively high technology costs; and forthcoming developments in the price of electricity [29,92] . To ensure energy security via ammonia, it is necessary to guarantee cost-effective, uninterrupted energy availability. To ensure energy security, the International Energy Agency (IEA) mandates that its member nations maintain reserves of crude oil equivalent to 90 days' worth [29,99]  to ensure energy security. Also regarded as crucial for energy security in renewable energies is stockpiling. Ammonia can be stored for extended periods of time due to liquefaction at 298 K [98] . In addition, the energy security of nations can be bolstered through the establishment of a new trade geography for the export and import of green ammonia, the increased significance of short-term cross-border electricity trade, and the pressing requirement for institutional and regulatory frameworks dedicated to green ammonia trade. The utilisation of ammonia derived from renewable energy sources holds promise for serving as a viable next-generation solution for energy storage, transportation, and power generation [66] . This can be achieved either through direct utilisation or by decomposing ammonia into hydrogen. The utilisation of “energy carriers” has the potential to effectively harness renewable energy sources by addressing the challenge of intermittent production and satisfying the growing and continuous energy demand. Additionally, it can contribute to achieving net zero emission targets by decarbonizing critical sectors such as transportation, industry, residential areas, shipping, and heating and cooling systems [48,95] . In addition to its use in energy transfer and storage [100] , ammonia can also be utilised for direct power generation in highly efficient high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), internal combustion engines, and gas turbines [50,101] . Ammonia has the potential to be introduced directly into solid oxide fuel cells operating at high temperatures (over 200 °C) for the purpose of stationary power production. This application has been found to yield comparable or superior performance when compared to hydrogen fuel cells. The utilisation of the endothermic ammonia decomposition reaction serves to facilitate the cooling of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), thus leading to an enhancement in the operational efficiency of high-temperature fuel cells that directly employ ammonia as a fuel source. The significance of advancements in catalysts for ammonia breakdown lies in their potential to enhance the performance of direct ammonia fuel cells through the utilisation of appropriate catalytic-membrane combinations [102] . Ammonia has the potential to serve as a substitute for carbon-based fuels, such as natural gas, petrol, and diesel, in internal combustion engines, and gas turbines [103,104] . This substitution offers various advantages over hydrogen, including extended operability ranges and higher power outputs [105] . Nevertheless, it is important to note that engine modifications might be necessary as a result of ammonia's subpar ignition quality, lower energy density in comparison to hydrocarbon fuels, relatively slow burning velocity, and limited flammability range of 15–25 % air. Hence, the enhancement of ammonia combustion can be achieved through the incorporation of a highly reactive fuel, such as hydrogen or methanol, in order to enhance both the ignition characteristics and the stability of the flame. One possible disadvantage associated with the combustion of ammonia is the generation of elevated levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx). However, this issue can be alleviated by conducting the combustion process at conditions that are slightly deficient in oxygen [48,106] . In the domain of automobile engineering, it has been observed that Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) and Internal Combustion (IC) engines exhibit the highest levels of overall efficiency, measuring at 19 % and 21 % respectively. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that a combined cycle turbine has the potential to achieve the highest electric efficiency, reaching up to 31 %. The total efficiency of the entire energy chain while utilising ammonia as the renewable energy vector is somewhat suboptimal for systems based on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Despite the relatively low efficiencies and varying degrees of maturity, ammonia continues to be a highly promising option for the conversion of renewable energy (RE) into hydrogen, subsequent transportation of the ammonia to areas with limited availability of renewable energy sources, and reconversion of the ammonia into hydrogen for local utilisation. Moreover, the current state of infrastructure for transporting liquid hydrogen is severely lacking, and the use of methanol as a fuel result in emissions at the time of use. These factors contribute to the diminished appeal of these options compared to ammonia, which serves as an emission-free energy carrier [100] . These technologies are suitable for combined heat and power applications and present a promising prospect for utilising ammonia as a fuel that is devoid of carbon emissions and leaves no carbon footprint at the point of utilisation. Green ammonia is a carbon–neutral energy storage medium that may be produced by combining air, water, and renewable energy sources. The share of green ammonia in the total ammonia production in the world is shown in Fig. 3  .  It has a wide range of potential energy applications, one of which is providing reliable and sustainable electricity for the power sector [92] . The cost-effectiveness of ammonia storage and transportation renders green ammonia a viable energy source across many geographical locations. Currently, the power industry is accountable for around 40 % of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions [107,108] . Due to the persistent increase in demand and dependence on fossil fuels, coupled with efforts towards digitalization and subsequent enhancements in energy efficiency, there has been a notable rise in energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions. Specifically, these emissions have escalated from 2.4 billion metric tonnes of CO2  in 2015 to a peak of 2.9 billion metric tonnes of CO2  in 2040 [108] . Projected energy system models (ESM) anticipate a swift adoption of variable renewable electricity (VRE) technologies, such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power, in order to achieve decarbonization of the electricity sector. The utilisation of carbon capture and storage (CCS), particularly in conjunction with bio-energy (BECCS), is widely recognised as a prominent approach for generating low-carbon electricity that can be readily controlled. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected that by the year 2040, approximately 5 % of the world's electricity production will be derived from facilities equipped with CCS technology [107] . The current progress in the reduction of carbon emissions in the shipping sector through the utilisation of green ammonia [109,110 ] highlights several benefits of ammonia that can also be extended to large-scale power generation. These advantages include the ability to scale up production while reducing costs, a relatively high energy density with uncomplicated storage requirements, safe utilisation in industrial environments, and the potential to be the most cost-effective zero-carbon alternative. Projections about the potential utilisation of ammonia as a fuel for maritime transportation vary significantly, with estimates ranging from 25 % to 99 % [53,111 ] of the worldwide marine fuel consumption by the year 2050. Prominent engine manufacturers are initiating the process of combustion development within their internal combustion engines (ICE). Green methanol is a fuel that is commonly taken into account for energy applications, particularly in the context of transportation. However, initial projections indicate that green ammonia is expected to be more cost-effective, mostly because of the significant expenses associated with the direct absorption of CO2  [51,93,105,109 ]. In the process of decarbonizing the extensive and established ammonia fertiliser supply chain, it has been projected that the shipping sector would necessitate a quantity of ammonia five times greater than the current global fertiliser industry by the year 2050, provided that it should completely shifted to utilising 100 % ammonia [54,55,112 ]. The feasibility of producing industrial-scale green ammonia is currently being evaluated in several countries, including Chile, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, and different locations in Australia [113,114 ]. These assessments are being conducted in anticipation of potential significant future markets for this product. Given the large scales involved, it may be reasonably postulated that green ammonia would be readily accessible as an energy carrier for power production in a majority of areas. Ammonia has been recognised as the most cost-effective means of international hydrogen trade, particularly with Japan, in comparison to liquid organic hydrogen carriers and liquefied hydrogen [26,51] . During the process of transitioning towards carbon neutrality, it is anticipated that ammonia production would relocate, to some extent, to areas that possess the most advantageous circumstances for generating renewable electricity. This movement is expected to result in a redirection of global ammonia trade, potentially leading to an overall rise in its volume [115,116 ]. The aforementioned advancement will also have an impact on the manufacturing and commerce of significant ammonia derivatives, including urea and ammonium nitrate [51] . Consequently, the transformation is expected to necessitate capital expenditure in the acquisition of novel ammonia transport vessels, the establishment of additional port infrastructure to facilitate loading, unloading, and storage operations, and the integration of downstream facilities into consuming centres [30,110 ]. The cost factors associated with the production and utilisation of green ammonia encompass investment costs (CAPEX), operating expenses (OPEX), storage and transportation costs, as well as interest rates pertaining to ammonia production facilities and renewable energy conversion systems. The potential for future reduction in capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) exists as a result of advancements in technology and the implementation of more efficient production methods [115 ]. Researchers anticipate a considerable possibility for additional cost reduction in the realm of renewable energy. However, it is worth noting that the cost deterioration of wind turbines poses a more formidable challenge compared to that of solar panels [116 ]. Likewise, it is anticipated that there will be cost reductions in the capital expenditures associated with electrolysis in the coming years, particularly in relation to proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers. In many global locations, there exists the potential for offshore production of green ammonia through the utilisation of offshore wind and solar energy sources. This potential is assessed while considering constraints such as land limitations and infrastructure needs. Offshore ammonia production is deemed highly appealing in numerous countries as a result of limited land availability. In the United Kingdom, it is possible for the entire ammonia production to be conducted offshore, with a potential maximum of 100 %. This study presents a comprehensive design optimisation for offshore ammonia production, focusing on identifying the specific situations in which the levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA) utilising offshore wind energy becomes economically competitive with a reference LCOA for green ammonia established in 2020. Nevertheless, the study did not take into account specific geographical locations, opting instead to focus on the average characteristics of offshore regions in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf [117 ]. In a simulation study of a North Sea energy hub system to assess electricity, hydrogen, and ammonia output and efficiency, ammonia had 52–52.3 % production, storage, and transport efficiency, and ammonia had 52–52.3 %. The sensitivity study shows that lowering capital expenses by 50 % leads to a reduction of 40–42 % in ammonia production costs. Results demonstrate that energy hubs can become viable cornerstones of future energy systems by making wind power cheaper [118 ]. In addition to wind energy, there are additional untapped offshore renewable energy sources that have the potential to be utilised for ammonia production. One such example is tidal streams [119 ]. The generation of ammonia onshore necessitates the installation of a costly and inefficient cable for the transfer of electricity from the offshore renewable energy source to the onshore production site. In the context of offshore ammonia production, it is necessary to establish a platform in close proximity to the offshore renewable energy source [92] . The produced ammonia is subsequently transported to the central through two primary methods: shipping or pipeline transportation, which entails a cost of around 2 USD per metric tonne per 100 km. The utilisation of offshore renewable energy in isolated oceanic areas or situations where grid connectivity is unfeasible would enable the exploration of previously untapped renewable energy sites, hence promoting the production of ammonia [92,120,121 ]. Despite the current high levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) associated with tidal-stream-energy, it is imperative to acknowledge the significant advantages offered by this technology, namely its predictability, consistent monthly capacity factor, and abundant resource availability. According to International Renewable Energy Agency (IREA) report, it has been observed that the Haber-Bosch process is capable of functioning at levels as low as 10–30 % of its maximum capability. In contrast to wind or solar energy, the use of a power source that exhibits predictability results in a reduced necessity for buffer storage in the context of ammonia production [23] . Therefore, it is advantageous to identify and employ a consistent and dependable offshore renewable energy resource for the purpose of generating environmentally friendly ammonia. The combination of wind and solar energy sources typically results in a higher capacity factor, ranging from 60 % to 70 %, as well as a reduced cost of ammonia compared to using either wind or solar energy alone, which typically have capacity factors ranging from 20 % to 60 % [23,92] . Therefore, the integration of cost-efficient offshore wind energy and reliable tidal-stream energy has the potential to facilitate the production of economically viable green ammonia. In the present moment and foreseeable future, there is a lack of both commercial and small-scale green ammonia manufacturing facilities that utilise tidal stream turbines as an energy source. While liquid hydrogen is frequently mentioned, there is a scarcity of evidence supporting its status as the most cost-effective transporter. The choice of ammonia, or methanol is contingent upon the specific use case, rendering them more favourable options [122 ]. Nonetheless, it is evident that ammonia emerges as the most favourable choice when employed as a fertiliser or when its direct utilisation in IC engines, turbines, and fuel cells is feasible without undergoing cracking. In order to facilitate international trade of green ammonia as energy commodity in large quantities, successful projects necessitate access to significant land resources and governments capable of incentivizing capital investments. Under certain conditions, the domestic supply capabilities for green ammonia production may be limited due to factors such as the availability of essential materials and opposition from the public. Nevertheless, while considering the global context, it can be observed that resources are generally accessible and there is a prevailing inclination towards public support. Notwithstanding these encouraging results, further comprehensive examination of ammonia as a spatial energy carrier is still warranted. Insufficient attention has been given to the comprehensive examination of the correlation between ammonia production and ammonia transportation. Ideally, future research endeavours will focus on optimising a comprehensive system for the delivery of ammonia, encompassing all issues of its production, transportation, and utilisation as an energy source [92] . The factors to be considered encompass the identification of optimal locations for ammonia production facilities, the effective handling of both immediate and long-term process adaptability, a comprehensive comprehension of the boundaries of ammonia supply and demand, the evaluation of potential synergies between production and transportation requirements, the judicious allocation of limited capital resources, methodologies to identify the most cost-effective alternatives for large-scale ammonia and the conducive atmosphere for new industries.  4 Power-to-ammonia-to-power (P2A2P) system The urgency of the global warming crisis has compelled governments to prioritise the transition of their power production systems towards achieving carbon neutrality in the foreseeable future. Increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources represents a highly promising avenue for attaining the desired objective. According to recent research, the cost of electricity derived from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass has been steadily declining. This may be attributed to the implementation of government regulations and significant improvements in related technology. As a result, it is anticipated that RES will play a significant role in power generation, surpassing conventional sources, by the year 2025 [123,124 ]. Nevertheless, the implementation of RES encounters challenges attributed to the inconsistent power supply they offer. In in this scenario, ammonia received global interest in recent decades. Japan has actively sought renewable alternatives to meet its energy consumption needs. One potential solution that has garnered attention is the use of ammonia as a carrier for hydrogen-based energy. To further explore this possibility, a consortium consisting of 22 members, led by Tokyo Gas, has been established to develop and promote “Green Ammonia.” This initiative is supported by the Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Programme (SIP) of Japan [125 ]. Green Ammonia Decoupled device developed by UK aims to demonstrate the conversion of wind energy into ammonia for the purpose of storage and subsequent release through an internal combustion engine [126 ]. The utilisation of ammonia in the transportation industry is subject to political influence and its role may undergo transformations. A recent development in Australia involves the establishment of a new branch of the NH3  Fuel Association, facilitated by the cooperation of industrial entities engaged in the production of ammonia and hydrogen. The Australian chapter aims to engage individuals and enterprises from Singapore, Malaysia, and New Zealand in order to enhance the recognition of the chemical compound, ammonia, and elevate its prominence in the fields of energy storage and power generation [127 ]. The projects implemented in Australia demonstrate that, in the event of effective implementation, these programmes have the potential to fully substitute natural gas usage through the production of hydrogen and ammonia. Moreover, the nation is actively engaged in the process of incorporating ammonia into the global market, both in terms of its integration into the international market and its involvement in renewable fuel production [128 ]. The Netherlands is at the forefront of promoting ammonia among mainland European nations. The justification for this assertion is that the Netherlands has a significant abundance of renewable resources due to huge investments made by both the government and industry. Hence, ammonia emerges as an energy carrier with the capacity to meet the nation's present energy requirements, while enabling production businesses to export surplus power and, subsequently, ammonia through advanced batteries that will supply the station by the timeframe of 2023–2030 [129 ]. According to the findings of the feasibility study, examining the commercial viability of green ammonia production in Chile, New Zealand, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and other countries, green ammonia could be utilised as an energy vector for electricity generation in the majority of locations [130,131 ]. As a result, green ammonia is a fuel that is both economically viable and technically feasible to utilise in high-efficiency gas turbine power facilities in order to achieve electricity sector decarbonization by 2040 [23,46,98] . At a power plant capacity factor of 25 % in 2040, the levelized cost of electricity generated from green ammonia is projected to be between 167 and 197 USD/MWh, assuming a price of 380 USD/t for broadly available green ammonia fuel. The electricity cost is on par with natural gas power stations that utilise post-combustion CCS, while it is considerably reduced in comparison to coal with CCS, bio-energy with CCS, and nuclear power. Fuelling hydrogen-fired gas turbines with cracked ammonia incurs additional expenses of 30 USD/MWh; therefore, gas turbine manufacturers should prioritise the development of a more ammonia-compatible turbine technology over the long term [49,110 ]. At present, the cost of producing green ammonia is troublesome with considerable uncertainty, primarily attributable to the lack of dependable experience curve data for electrolyser capital costs and the wide variety of forecasts that exist. The substantial reduction of this uncertainty is anticipated in the future years due to the increased distribution of large-scale electrolyser projects. The cost of capital is subject to a comparable degree of uncertainty, as it can be influenced by economic and political factors. The projected levelized cost of green ammonia in 2040 varies between 222 USD/t and 480 USD/t, as determined by a set of assumptions concerning the cost of electrolysers, the cost of capital, and the costs of solar PV that are practically achievable [49] . In contrast to other notable low-carbon alternatives, green ammonia exhibits its highest competitiveness at power plant capacity factors below 25 %. At present, capacity factors for dispatchable electricity generation frequently exceed 50 % [107] . However, future projections indicate that capacity factors will likely be considerably lower. Beyond LCOE, green ammonia has a number of significant advantages over CCS-based alternatives. To begin with, green ammonia exhibits geographical independence, minimising transportation expenses and ensuring its availability in all locations should it gain significant traction in the shipping industry. CCS necessitates the transport of CO2  to suitable underground storage locations at a high cost or local underground storage. Moreover, ammonia CCGT is readily scalable to tens of MW, enabling it to provide future decentralised grids with valuable balancing services [49] . The International Energy Agency (IEA) also places significant emphasis on the necessity of green ammonia power. The application of energy storage technologies has been identified as a significant area for research and development, offering potential solutions to the problem at hand. In the context of long-term and grid-scale energy system integration, chemical energy storage emerges as a viable option due to its favourable characteristics such as high energy density, substantial storage capacity, and a low rate of self-discharge [132 ]. Hydrogen has garnered significant attention as a potentially viable chemical storage medium for the transportation and storage of renewable energy sources [47] . However, its practical implementation is hindered by some limitations, including its low volumetric density, high flammability, and substantial energy loss. Various solutions have been suggested to address the challenges associated with hydrogen, including methane, methanol, and ammonia [103,133 ]. Ammonia stands out due to its notable attributes, including its elevated energy density, substantial hydrogen content, and absence of carbon emissions in comparison to competing options. The use of this technology has the potential to address the energy-intensive and high emission challenges associated with ammonia factories that rely on fossil fuels. There are two distinct methods for the production of green ammonia, specifically referred to as power-to-ammonia (P2A) and biomass-to-ammonia (B2A). The first method relies on renewable water electrolysis, namely solid oxide water electrolysis and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis [134 ]. In contrast, the second method is based on biomass reforming, specifically biomass gasification and chemical looping combustion [135,136 ]. Furthermore, in order to enhance the utilisation of ammonia as an energy carrier rather than solely a storage medium, scholars have conducted investigations into two distinct paths for ammonia-to-power (A2P) conversion: electrochemical and thermochemical approaches. The electrochemical technique has extensively explored the direct ammonia fuel cell, encompassing its thermodynamic analysis, electrochemical mechanism, design of key components, and economic analysis [137 ]. Furthermore, researchers have also examined the utilisation of ammonia combustion in other contexts, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, and boilers [138 ]. In order to assess the potential of power to ammonia, an investigation was conducted on the strategic plan for utilising ammonia and methanol as energy carriers to attain carbon neutrality in China between 2018 and 2060. This study primarily examined the interconnection between the energy and chemical industries at a broader scale, with economic analysis as the primary methodology [139 ]. A study examined the power-to-ammonia-to-power (P2A2P) and biomass-to-ammonia-to-power (B2A2P) pathways inside autonomous renewable multi-generation systems over eight different scenarios. In order to provide a more comprehensible comparison, two profitability metrics were employed. The analysis encompassed technical and economic variables. The dominance of the B2A process results in a higher level of stability in the efficiencies, consistently ranging between 40 % and 50 %, regardless of the fluctuations in renewable energy sources. In contrast, the energy and exergy efficiencies in the P2A2P pathway are significantly influenced by the equilibrium between supply and demand. The percentages exhibit seasonal fluctuations, ranging from 27 % to 47 % throughout the year. In addition, it should be noted that the B2A process exhibits a higher degree of exothermicity, hence leading to enhanced heat recovery and subsequently improving the total efficiency. In terms of power generation, the P2A2P pathway demonstrated superior efficiency. The construction and operating expenditures associated with the P2A2P pathway have a somewhat lower magnitude in comparison to those of the B2A2P pathway [123 ]. There are currently three distinct methodologies employed in the production of green ammonia. The first approach, known as power-to-ammonia (P2A), utilises renewable water electrolysis. The second approach, biomass-to-ammonia (B2A), involves biomass gasification. Lastly, electrochemical techniques, although currently limited to laboratory-scale experimentation, they contribute to the generation of green ammonia [140 ]. These technologies include SOFC electrolysis [141 ] and PEM electrolysis [142 ]. Similarly, the term B2A pertains to the amalgamation of biomass reforming with the HB process, wherein the main focus of research endeavours lies in reactor design, heat management, and system-level analysis. The aforementioned techniques can be categorised as biomass gasification and chemical looping combustion [135 ]. The study also includes an examination of P2A (water electrolysis) and B2A (biomass gasification and biogas reforming) through the application of thermo-chemical modelling tools, allowing for a comparative analysis [143 ]. The ammonia-to-power (A2P) technology has garnered increased interest due to its potential as a pivotal method for using ammonia as an energy carrier, hence serving as a substitute for hydrogen. There have been two primary methodologies that have been put forth: electrochemical and thermochemical. The electrochemical approach is examined in a comprehensive literature review, which provides an overview of direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) through thermodynamic, electrochemical, and mathematical studies. The primary elements discussed in this review are the electrodes and electrolytes, as well as the associated costs [137 ]. The research included in this review mostly centres around experimental and simulation analyses aimed at evaluating the design of Direct Alcohol Fuel Cells (DAFCs). Additionally, several works investigate the performance of DAFCs within the context of an energy system, such as a renewable system [134 ] and combined heat, hydrogen, and power systems [144 ]. Conventional power plants are currently facing the necessity to enhance their flexibility in order to accommodate the increasing integration of RES. This entails their role in grid stabilisation, as well as efforts to minimise carbon emissions and uphold a reliable, environmentally friendly, and secure energy supply. In the present scenario, natural gas-fired power plants are presently regarded as the most adaptable power generation facilities for operation inside the European grid, with the aim of facilitating the integration of high shares of renewable energy sources [145 ]. The integration of alternative fuels, such as ammonia (NH3 ), into gas turbines might effectively address the fuel transition challenge that the European Union (EU) is currently encountering. This integration has the potential to significantly mitigate emissions of CO, CO2 , and HC. In contrast, the integration of the P2A2P technology has the potential to assist Natural Gas Combined Cycles (NGCCs) in achieving load balancing and mitigating their environmental footprint. The decarbonization of traditional NGCCs can be achieved by the integration of a P2X2P process that relies on hydrogen and ammonia. The user provided a numerical reference [146 ]. The FLEXnCONFU P2A idea is designed to achieve a cost-effective investment with a relatively limited production capacity. It offers time flexibility through the utilisation of established technology and demonstrates moderate cycle efficiency. Consequently, it is regarded as an intermediate solution. The analysis in Aspen Plus software considers the efficiency of the power to fuel to power (P2F2P) concept and compares this efficiency value to other values of other synthetic fuels found in the existing literature. The measured efficiencies of P2F2P, which are 7 % and 8 %, appear to be somewhat low when compared to the efficiencies of other fuels such as methane, methanol, dimethyl ether, and ammonia [147 ]. In an investigation to assess the potential effects of employing ammonia as a substitute fuel, the layout of the P2A2P system is delineated, followed by an assessment of the process's scalability for integration purposes. The evaluation of the size and Balance of Plant (BOP) optimisation for the P2A2P process and its integration with the GT system also takes into account the potential influence on the GT system. The P2A system and the fuel supply system exhibit an approximate efficiency of 40 %, however the roundtrip efficiency of the P2A2P integrated process is approximately 15 % [104] . The integration of hybrid solar PV and wind generating, along with the utilisation of green ammonia as a seasonal energy storage medium, presents a promising prospect in South Africa to reduce the cost of electricity and CO2  emission. In order to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a P2A2P configuration, the integration of wind and solar resources is paired with energy storage to develop a robust power grid. In addition to the storage of ammonia, batteries are also employed as a means of energy storage. The use of the optimised Haber-Bosch design resulted in an aggregate load factor ranging from 20 % to 30 %. The most cost-effective design, with a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of 0.15 USD/kWh at a 5 % annual discount rate, was observed in a hybrid system operating at a 30 % load factor. This system consisted of 37 % wind-based and 63 % solar-based energy producing capacity. This analysis suggests that the optimal configuration of hybrid energy systems will have a significant impact on determining the required energy storage capacity for reducing the LCOE. [148 ]. Despite the fact that both P2A (Power-to-Ammonia) and A2P (Ammonia-to-Power) technologies are now in their early stages of development and are only being tested on a small scale, scholars have begun to outline the framework for an ammonia-based economy. In this envisioned economy, ammonia is seen as the primary energy carrier, capable of completely replacing fossil fuels [19,101] . Several investigations focused on contemporary advancements in constructing an independent system based on ammonia generation and utilisation technologies such as. Following a comprehensive assessment of their merits and drawbacks, a review has been put forth for ammonia power system on islands. A comparative analysis was conducted to assess the levelized costs of electricity generated by various types of power plants, including green ammonia-fuelled combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants. It is projected that by the year 2040, green ammonia may potentially be accessible in numerous global sites, with a cost below 400 USD per metric tonne. Additionally, there is a considerable potential for the reduction of costs to less than 300 USD/t through the utilisation of sophisticated electrolysers and the availability of suitable renewable resources for the production of green ammonia. The LCOE is expected to be between 167 and 197 USD/MWh for a power plant capacity factor of 25 % [149 ]. This estimation assumes that green ammonia fuel will be readily accessible at a price of 380 USD per metric tonne. [49] . In a study, the thermodynamics of a combined solar-based ammonia synthesis and fuel cell system are studied. This system uses the extra energy from a solar PV power plant to make ammonia, which is then used to make energy. The total system exhibits varying levels of energy efficiency, ranging from 15.68 % to 15.83 % throughout the year [134 ].. The same researchers focused on the development of a simulation model for a system that effectively combines surplus power generated from solar and wind energy sources. The primary objective of the system is to produce and store ammonia, which can be subsequently utilised for power generation during periods of limited energy availability. This power generation process involves the use of ammonia-fed solid oxide fuel cells. Additionally, a reverse osmosis desalination system is employed to generate fresh desalinated water when there is an abundance of energy. The overall energy efficiency is observed from 46.1 % to 53.3 % throughout the year [58] . The disparity in efficiency observed between these two studies can be attributed to the varying proportions of solar and wind outputs The investigation of multi-generation B2A2P yielded maximum energy and exergy efficiencies of 60.1 % and 56.3 %, respectively. The attainment of high efficiencies can be facilitated by wind energy patter and fluctuations in ammonia output. B2A2P demonstrates as an promising energy storage method due to its potential for better efficiency and reduced electricity usage besides, carbon dioxide capture [142 ]. The challenges associated with ammonia for power include the need for large-scale carbon-free synthesis of ammonia, the efficient generation and utilisation of power at various scales ranging from small to utility-scale, ensuring public acceptance, complying with safety regulations, assessing the economic viability of integrating technologies, promoting green ammonia production and utilisation, and establishing supportive policies for emerging industries.  5 Contribution of green ammonia to SDGs According to the United Nations (UN) report, 2015, 17 sustainability development goals (SDGs) would be accomplished by 2030. These goals are interrelated in order to promote the well-being and safety of all individuals (Table 2  ). The SDGs have the overarching objective of eradicating all manifestations of hunger and poverty on a global scale, while concurrently safeguarding ecosystems and preserving natural resources for the benefit of future generations. Within this particular context, the strategy employed by the UN aims to safeguard terrestrial ecosystems and aquatic environments, foster the generation of environmentally sustainable renewable energy, address the issue of climate change, and ultimately strengthen the interconnections among the aforementioned SDGs. Green ammonia is closely associated with most of these objectives. However, the degree of relevance varies across different SDGs, and eight goals are identified as being more relevant [6,150 ]. The agriculture sector exhibits a strong correlation with Sustainable Development Goals 1–15. The decrease of poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2) in developing countries is intricately linked to the production and usage of fertilizers derived from green ammonia, which is sourced from locally available renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the use of green ammonia as a buffer has proven effective in mitigating the seasonal fluctuations of renewable energy sources, ensuring a steady and reliable power supply necessary for the establishment and progress of the development foundation [151 ]. In the agricultural sector, it is currently seen that a substantial amount, precisely 80 %, of the ammonia produced is designated for utilisation as a fertiliser. However, special emphasis is placed on wheat, maize, and rice, as these crops account for more than 50 % of the total demand for nitrogen-based fertilisers [167 ]. The use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers in global food production, which is heavily reliant on international trade, poses a significant risk to both global food security and the resilience of food systems [168 ]. In general, a limited number of nations, like Russia, Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, are the major exporters of ammonia and N-fertilizers. Several nations, including China, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, South Korea, Japan, Belarus, and Poland, exhibit a pattern of becoming net importers of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers through the means of natural gas imports, although each has its own capacity for fertiliser production [51,101,168 ]. Due to the depletion of fossil fuels and stingy international policies towards CO2 emissions, these strategies pose challenges to the maintenance of global food security. For instance, the need for fertilisers is essential to sustain a population of 379 million individuals in India, 185 million individuals in Brazil, and 151 million individuals in China. India and China primarily use the food produced from fertilisers to meet the dietary needs of their respective domestic populations. Consequently, these countries heavily rely on trade, energy availability, and supply disruptions to sustain their domestic food production [168 ]. The transition of fertiliser production towards achieving net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can yield a dual advantage by simultaneously mitigating CO2 emissions and boosting food security. Including these nations, many developing countries have enormous amounts of renewable energy sources. However, these countries depend on fossil fuel imports to produce ammonia for fertiliser or on importing conventional ammonia for fertiliser production. Presently, green ammonia generation through the Haber Bosh process with electricity from renewable energy sources is established for decentralised ammonia production [157,169 ]. Therefore, by using this strategy, developing countries can produce green ammonia and N-fetilizers. This concept can reduce the import expenses of developing countries as well as support the sustainable development of the agricultural sector, which could contribute to the food security of many nations like India, China, Brazil, African countries, and so on. Furthermore, the implementation of green ammonia for farmers could contribute to the SDGs related to poverty alleviation, food security, sustainable agriculture, and so on. Moreover, green ammonia has a notable indirect impact on nutrition. The productivity of animal production is positively correlated with the abundance of grasses and plants, which in turn is influenced by the application of ammonia-based fertilisers. Nevertheless, the augmentation of grass production yields reduced environmental impacts, and the development of farms demonstrated the lowest carbon footprint [51] . The green ammonia can contribute to the prevention of human health (SDG3). The act of ammonia deposition leads to the occurrence of eutrophication and acidity. Hence, it is imperative to consider these issues while formulating pertinent strategies to address this Sustainable Development Goal (SDG3). Ammonia emissions, constituting 13 % of agricultural emissions, result in an average increase of 0.36 μg/m3 in the population's exposure to particulate matter [170 ]. The substitution of conventional ammonia with environmentally friendly alternatives has the potential to mitigate the adverse effects associated with its use. This is mostly due to the fact that green technology relies on renewable energy sources. The conventional production of ammonia from coal or coke over pathways creates impacts to the water bodies and sanitation. Therefore, appropriate technology for the green ammonia generation methods facilitates the distribution of potable water and sanitation services (SDG6). Irrespective of the specific raw material pathway employed, it is evident that the alteration in power input had the most significant effect. This underscores the imperative nature of implementing clean power sources within the synthetic ammonia sector.[171 ]. The application of nitrogen-based fertilisers in the agricultural sector has led to an increase in emissions associated with water pollution and acidification [172 ]. Therefore, it is advisable to substitute the excessive consumption of conventional ammonia with green ammonia in order to alleviate the adverse effects on the ecosystem, particularly in relation to agricultural wastewater. The production of green ammonia involves the use of sustainable energy sources, atmospheric components, and water, thus establishing a significant connection with SDG7. The utilisation of green ammonia as a zero-carbon energy storage and transport medium in various geographical regions, along with its cost-effectiveness in terms of transportation and storage, sets it apart from alternative approaches like underground hydrogen storage or geological storage of captured carbon. These alternatives incur higher costs for transportation and storage [13] . The production and transportation of ammonia are contingent upon the accessibility of RES and the existence of efficient and secure delivery methods. The energy efficiency of green ammonia generation using different production methods, namely hydropower, nuclear, biomass, and municipal waste, are close to be 42 %, 23 %, 15 %, and 12 %, correspondingly [173 ]. Furthermore, the viability of utilising ammonia in various applications is contingent upon the accessibility of ammonia inside urban areas. Ammonia exhibits compatibility with steel pipelines, with only minor adaptations to the existing infrastructure primarily designed for the transportation of natural gas and oil. By adopting this approach, the issue pertaining to the accessibility of ammonia will be resolved. The volumetric energy densities of liquid ammonia allow pipelines to transfer over 50 % more energy compared to the transportation of compressed natural gas [100] . The P2A2P technology is founded upon interdisciplinary linkages, wherein the battolysers serve to supply the grid with electrical energy. In addition to its primary functions, the grid has the capability to supply power to the ammonia manufacturing plant during periods of battolyser discharge or low wind conditions, ensuring the system is adequately heated and pressurised. Nevertheless, the implementation of a backup system is not necessary. The system exhibits a notable attribute of flexibility, wherein an additional amount of ammonia can be injected into the system from an external source [174 ]. The utilisation of green ammonia for decentralised power generation can be achieved through direct combustion in gas turbines or reciprocating engines, as well as through electrochemical dissociation in fuel cells. In addition, the green ammonia can be cracked in to hydrogen for the effective use in gas turbines and fuel cells [163 ]. By the year 2040, green ammonia is projected to emerge as a viable and economically competitive fuel option for generating zero-carbon energy through the use of highly efficient power plants. This development has the potential to significantly contribute to the economic prosperity of a nation, aligning with SDG8. The primary determinant of economic competitiveness in the transition from conventional ammonia to environmentally friendly alternatives is the prevailing cost of power in the local region. The fluctuation in fuel prices can be related to the differences between locally accessible and imported options. Additionally, several grids require diverse levels of capacity utilisation rates for dispatchable energy supplies. The economic ramifications associated with the development of green ammonia-based fertilisers, facilitated by the use of hydropower, demonstrate that green ammonia has the capacity to offset variations in hydropower output, spanning from 900 to 50 MW, and can potentially generate an additional power output of up to 370 MW [151 ]. The development and utilisation of green ammonia have a significant influence on various sectors of industry and infrastructure, aligning with SDG9. Followed by Sulfuric acid, ammonia as the second-largest chemical produced in industries. It serves as a primary precursor for several chemicals and synthetic fertilisers, functions as a refrigerant in refrigerators and air conditioning systems, holds significance as a chemical of importance in manufacturing industries, and serves as an alternative fuel in internal combustion engines as well as fuel cell-based power plants. In order to attain sustainability, it is imperative to advocate for the widespread adoption of green ammonia, which is produced from renewable energy sources, across all industries associated with ammonia [175 ]. A techno-economic feasibility analysis comparing the production of green ammonia to traditional ammonia production, using a reference capacity of 50,000 tons per year, revealed that the B2A process exhibits the highest level of exothermicity. However, this process is subject to significant restrictions due to the substantial amount of heat needed for acid gas scavenging. Nevertheless, the power-based ammonia production plant may pose a competitive threat if the payback period is less than five years [35] . The current surge in the exploration of green ammonia as a means to decarbonise the shipping industry serves as a strong indication of the manifold benefits associated with green ammonia. According to projections, the utilisation of green ammonia as a fuel in the maritime industry is expected to reach 99 % by the year 2050. The utilisation of ammonia, produced from water electrolysis results in a 27 % reduction in total GHG emissions, as opposed to its generation from natural gas fuel. The utilisation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) powered by green ammonia has the potential to be an optimal choice in marine transport, which is due to the significant reductions in both NOx and GHG emissions, up to 93.4 % and 92 % respectively, when compared to conventional systems [114,176 ]. Ammonia possesses the advantageous characteristic of serving as a versatile energy barrier, rendering it suitable for application as an environmentally friendly substance for fuel cells. The ammonia-based fuel cells provide several notable advantages, including their affordability, moderate working temperature, impressive efficiency, and exceptional durability. Additionally, they have the capability to use a wide range of fuel sources [177 ]. The utilisation of ammonia in power generation facilities and transportation systems has the potential to make significant contributions towards the achievement of sustainable cities and communities, as outlined in SDG11. The greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the utilisation of ammonia in transportation exhibit a notable reduction of over 60 % in comparison to vehicles powered by diesel and gasoline. A comparable pattern is evident in power plants that operate using natural gas [165 ]. The utilisation of green ammonia has the potential to substantially reduce or eliminate the presence of carbon dioxide and ammonia in minuscule quantities. During the process of conventional ammonia-fertiliser synthesis, natural gas is used as both an energy source and a processing gas. According to estimates, the production of one metric tonne of NH3 requires the use of approximately 35.2 GJ of natural gas [178 ]. Consequently, there is an observed rise in natural gas use per metric tonne of agricultural output. The utilisation of green ammonia has the potential to yield substantial savings in fossil fuel resources due to its reliance on renewable energy sources for production. This aligns with the objectives outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 12. One notable benefit of utilising green ammonia as an energy carrier lies in the fact that its primary constituent, nitrogen, is readily available in ample quantities throughout the environment [163,178 ]. The primary source of NH3  emissions is the agricultural sector, which accounts for around 55 to 56 % of global emissions [167 ]. There is a growing impetus to effectively respond to any alterations in the Earth's climate in alignment with SDG13. There is a growing trend in environmental regulation and investment towards the promotion of green technologies, which aim to mitigate the adverse effects of emissions on the environment. The production of ammonia via traditional energy sources resulted in the highest measured greenhouse gas emissions, amounting to 3.97 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent. The burning of ammonia in power plants is responsible for a mere 6 % of the overall global warming potential, whereas the combustion of natural gas within these facilities is responsible for around 97 % of GHG emissions. In which the contribution of CO2 is approximately 98.6 %. This approach to harnessing the clean and abundant energy provided by wind power offers a sustainable solution for green ammonia production. Research has demonstrated that the substitution of traditional fuels with green ammonia has the potential to greatly alleviate the substantial impacts associated with power generation and urban mobility [165 ]. Even if a P2A2P system works without CCS, it could be economically viable; however, a CCS can make the P2A2P system the most cost-effective choice. [174 ]. The utilisation of ammonia is anticipated to have a detrimental impact on air quality due to the release of CO2 emissions during traditional ammonia production processes. Additionally, the application of ammonia as a fertiliser is expected to contribute to the generation of CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions. The emissions of NOx, specifically nitrous oxide (N2O), provide further contributions to climate change through the creation of nitric acid. There exists a correlation between the release of pollutants from soil and the occurrence of air pollution, similar to the correlation observed between the emission of pollutants from manufacturing plants and air pollution [178 ]. The enhancement of land productivity for agricultural endeavours, as outlined in SDG15, is positively influenced by the progressive adoption of green ammonia. The utilisation of green ammonia as a sustainable fertiliser has the potential to enhance agricultural productivity by increasing the yield of agricultural goods per unit area. Consequently, this would lead to a reduction in the amount of land required to produce each tonne of agricultural products [162 ]. Assessing the influence of green ammonia on water bodies poses challenges due to the multifaceted nature of its effects, which encompass the manufacturing stage, application, and subsequent discharge phases. There exist interrelated elements, including bodies of water and structures in close proximity to land. Conventional ammonia is also implicated in terrestrial ecotoxicity, as evidenced by studies indicating that higher quantities of fertiliser result in increased ecotoxicity [172,179 ]. The use of municipal solid waste for ammonia production had the lowest global warming potential when compared to the nuclear-based and biomass-based methods. The application of fertilisers has been shown to enhance crop yields. Therefore, a broader adoption of fertilisers could potentially reduce the amount of land needed for agricultural production, consequently mitigating the necessity to convert natural ecosystems into farmland. In the interim, the enhancement of fertiliser utilisation has the potential to mitigate the adverse environmental effects stemming from air pollution [51] . In order to enhance the global alliance for sustainable development (SDG 17), the utilisation of green ammonia is expected to facilitate the advancement of financial and technological aspects. Additionally, collaborative endeavours among nations will be fostered through the implementation of national legal measures, technology transfer, and integrated investment. The enhancement of the worldwide collaboration for the sustainable advancement of green ammonia will be achieved via the facilitation of financial resources and the promotion of technological advancements in the domain of sustainable green ammonia production. Enhancing global sustainability and fostering partnership among nations can be achieved by the implementation of national legislative laws, facilitating technological transfer, and promoting integrated investment. In order to accomplish this objective, it is imperative for states to provide support for the mobilisation of existing energy sources, facilitate the exchange of technologies, foster collaboration in the domain of research and technology, extend financial assistance to developing nations, ensure macroeconomic stability, and promote the sharing of financial resources [13,150,152 ].  6 Obstacles in green ammonia utilization The primary impediment to the synthesis of green ammonia is the substantial capital expenditure required. The synthesis of green ammonia via many strategies including the Haber process necessitates the utilisation of green hydrogen and nitrogen. Given that renewable energy sources are the primary means of power generation, it is crucial to consider the capital and maintenance costs associated with renewable energy generation systems. The challenges to green ammonia production encompass concerns regarding the dependability and sustainability of energy conversion technologies [101] . Despite the existence of several programmes aimed at promoting green ammonia production, the proportion of energy generated through these means remains relatively modest when compared to traditional methods. This discrepancy may be attributed primarily to various barriers and problems that must be effectively addressed in order to facilitate the widespread implementation of green energy technologies on an industrial scale. Green ammonia is an emerging energy supply technology that still faces numerous economic, financial, technical, and social obstacles before it can be considered mature. As a result, policy support is required to address the challenges posed by the aforementioned factor and enable the consideration of green ammonia as a feasible energy generation technique [150,180 ]. The primary obstacles to the production of green ammonia are the substantial financial investments and energy demands. The International Renewable Energy Agency projects that the demand for green hydrogen, which is utilised in the production of green ammonia, will increase substantially to 134–159 Mt by 2050. In order to generate the necessary quantity of green hydrogen, the capacities of offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar PV are 1,775, 2,243, and 4,240 GW, respectively. The same holds true for the production of green ammonia. The high CAPEX and renewable energy costs of electrolysers can be mitigated through the implementation of an appropriate supporting policy. Promoting the development of green ammonia production in nations abundant in renewable energy sources is an additional crucial policy. The introduction of green ammonia into the energy sector will have a substantial effect on the global temperature increase of 1.5 °C and make a valuable contribution to the pursuit of an energy policy with zero carbon emissions [23,116 ]. Similar to other industries, the primary impediment to the progress of the green ammonia sector is its high cost. Consequently, policies should take into account the cost of the CO2 emissions that are saved when green ammonia is utilised. Green ammonia production is best suited in nations with favourable conditions for renewable energy sources as solar energy, wind, hydropower, or geothermal energy. Apart from electrical energy, fresh water and nitrogen are also needed in the manufacturing chain. A number of studies assessed the economic feasibility of producing and exporting green ammonia by taking into account the renewable energy sources that are available in the export destination as well as the expenses associated with shipping and pipe supply [181 ]. Given the strong correlation between green hydrogen and green ammonia, such studies are also taken into account when assessing the likelihood of discovering the probable countries. [182 ]. It was discovered that imports green ammonia from Morocco were more economically appealing to Belgium than local production [183 ] after 2030, though, the cost of producing and transporting green ammonia may become economically feasible. The viable application of green hydrogen and ammonia is studied in many countries including Australia, Chile, China, the US, Russia, Canada, India, the European Union, African states, the Middle East, Japan, and so on [115,181,182 ]. After 2030, this plan can be successfully implemented in nations like Australia that have abundant renewable energy resources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, etc.), as well as land, water, and maritime infrastructure [51,182,184 ]. 6.1 Environmental impact assessment Environmental impact of ammonia is directly correlated with its concentration in the surrounding environment. Ammonia poses significant health risks to both humans and other organisms. Hence, it is imperative to ensure that the exposure to ammonia, whether in the form of atmospheric gas, liquid, or fertiliser, remains within a specified threshold. One further environmental consequence of ammonia is its manufacturing process, which typically involves the utilisation of fossil fuels to produce hydrogen, separate nitrogen from the air, and convert nitrogen into ammonia NH3 [10,185 ]. The environmental impacts linked with the ammonia production process mostly stem from the release of CO2  emissions resulting from the conversion processes [186 ]. The transition from a fossil carbon energy-based economy to an ammonia-based one necessitates meticulous evaluation of the environmental consequences stemming from the production and use of this novel fuel. It is crucial that humanity does not evade one issue related to CO2 emissions only to create another crisis regarding NH3 and NOx emissions. The issue of growing nitrate concentrations and their impact on marine ecosystems requires heightened attention [101] . While there is a considerable amount of research available on the techno-economic elements of ammonia production and transport, the analysis of environmental implications is very few. According to Gilbert et. Al [187 ], combining biomass gasification with ammonia production can decrease 65 % of greenhouse gas emissions compared to the traditional method. A comparative investigation of the life cycle of NH3 production through electrolysis, using energy from hydro, nuclear, biomass, and municipal waste sources, revealed that biomass-based ammonia production was more environmentally sustainable for the specific locations in Algeria and Mexico [188 ]. According to Arora et. al [189 ], a biomass-based ammonia production system on a modest scale can decrease emissions by up to 64 % when compared to traditional systems. Chemical looping integration offers a viable solution for mitigating CO2 emissions [190 ]. Considering the CO2 emissions related to the entire ammonia supply chain, it is possible to achieve a 36 % decrease in CO2 emissions for power generation using ammonia compared to a natural gas combined cycle with carbon capture and storage. Chemical looping hydrogen production can generate highly concentrated streams of H2  and N2 . Furthermore, by eliminating the air separation unit, energy consumption is significantly lowered by around 60 %, which results in a more sustainable alternative for hydrogen generation. Conversely, there was a 60 % increase in emissions to water and a 30 % rise in emissions to soil due to the greater amount of water being transferred to the wastewater treatment plant. Switching to renewable electricity sources can further reduce emissions in natural gas-based ammonia synthesis methods, particularly in terms of air emissions [191 ]. Conventional ammonia production emits carbon dioxide emissions at 1.8 % rate [50] , for example, 2.2 kg CO2  per kilogramme of NH3  was released [10] . Therefore, green ammonia from RES received much attention. The emission of ammonia into the atmosphere leads to a chemical reaction with atmospheric moisture, resulting in the formation of ammonium. The presence of ammonium in precipitation can result in an elevation in the osmotic concentration of the soil [185 ]. A concentration as low as 0.02 parts per million (ppm) has been found to have lethal effects on delicate marine organisms [192 ]. The presence of ammonia can have substantial implications for human health due to its ability to generate a potent alkaline solution, leading to skin irritation, respiratory system discomfort, and eye irritation. The threshold limit for the unpleasant odour of ammonia is 5 parts per million (ppm), which serves as an indicator of the presence of NH3 in the surrounding environment. Exposure above 134 ppm has been associated with significant noise and throat irritation. When the concentration of a substance exceeds 2000 parts per million (ppm), it might have fatal consequences for an individual. Additionally, exposure to high concentrations of this substance can result in severe skin related health issues [52] . The availability of land for the establishment of new production and handling facilities is constrained. Therefore, future research endeavours should prioritise the development and enhancement of conventional ammonia production facilities.  6.2 Technological challenges While there are established technologies for the manufacture, transportation, and utilisation of traditional ammonia, there are numerous technical challenges associated with its capacity, feasibility, infrastructure, labour expertise, and production and utilisation viability. Within the realm of RES, it is widely acknowledged that wind and solar energy exhibit the greatest promise for the large-scale production of environmentally friendly ammonia. Additional barriers that warrant consideration include the efficiency of direct green NH3  synthesis, as well as factors pertaining to availability, reliability, and maturity. In order to address the issue of the elevated cost of green ammonia resulting from its limited energy efficiency caused by fluctuations in renewable power and substantial investment expenses, a hybrid approach was adopted by integrating a liquid air energy storage system with a power-to-ammonia system. This combination aimed to effectively manage the uncertainties associated with both power supply and demand. The traditional P2A method, which operates with a grid connection, is inadequate for managing the uncertainties associated with fluctuations in renewable energy sources and utility electricity prices. Using a LAES in conjunction with a green ammonia and electricity co-production system, these uncertainties can be managed. LAES is a relatively new method for storing energy on a large scale that features a substantial transit efficiency of 50–60 %, an energy storage density of approximately 200 kWh/m3 [193 ], exceptional safety performance [194 ], and a minimal levelized cost of storage [195 ]. This technology has demonstrated technical and economic viability, as evidenced by the construction of multiple commercial facilities in the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, due to its exceptional energy storage efficiency, extended storage endurance, and secure operation, it can function as a buffer to mitigate the risks associated with power supply and demand fluctuations in the P2A process. By incorporating LAES into a P2A process, ammonia was produced with a P2A efficiency and a specific energy consumption of 83 % and 7.4 kWh/kg NH3, respectively. A minimum cost of 360.74 euros per tonne can be achieved for ammonia production along with 77 % inclusion of renewable energy sources. As the dispatchable electricity price and peak electricity price increased from 150 to 250 €/tonne, there was a substantial reduction in the levelized cost of NH3 (LCONH3) from 587.0 to 122.7 €/tonne [194,196 ]. Furthermore, to increase its round-trip efficacy, LAES is capable of absorbing external thermal energy, such as the cold energy of liquefied natural gas [60]  and low-grade waste heat from industry [197 ]. The utilisation of high-temperature electrolysis is made possible through the implementation of the continuous P2A process, which in turn leads to the attainment of a remarkable production efficiency of 83 % through the integration of system thermal components. [196 ]. Nevertheless, alternative approaches are also used for the direct production of ammonia, which are deemed to be more advantageous in terms of efficiently harnessing RES. The primary obstacle confronting these methodologies is their limited conversion efficiency. Fortunately, ongoing research and development endeavours are currently focused on enhancing efficiency levels by up to 60 % through the utilisation of electrochemical techniques [198 ]. Despite having been in existence since 1920, the primary focus of transitioning to green synthesis is predominantly centred around the production cost and capacity of the electrolyser [92,199,200 ]. Nevertheless, the current unconventional approaches to green ammonia synthesis are not yet feasible for implementation in commercial settings, and thus, necessitating additional investigation. The widespread accessibility of RES promotes the decentralised production of environmentally friendly ammonia. Nevertheless, it is imperative to accurately forecast economic considerations due to the regional variations in renewable energy sources. In addition, the storage and management of green ammonia in large amounts poses a significant challenge due to the uneven accessibility of renewable energy sources and the lack of appropriate technologies for securely handling the flammable ammonia in decentralised storage facilities [95,201 ]. The investigation and innovation process There exists a dearth of comparative analyses that examine the distinctions between green ammonia and traditional ammonia production methods that incorporate carbon capture and storage technologies. In addition to direct research, there is a need for indirect research in the field of renewable energies. This includes doing life cycle assessments on the resources utilised in these energy sources. For instance, in wind generation, elements. Thorough and comprehensive investigations are necessary prior to the transfer from the traditional process to newly developed green synthesis. Efficient catalysts are required for the activation of nitrogen gas, as indicated by the thermodynamic potential [202 ]. A research gap exists in the field of ammonia technology, specifically pertaining to challenges associated with the separation of unreacted materials and the subsequent low yield of ammonia under low pressure conditions. Consequently, there is a need to explore alternative catalysts that are both highly selective and efficient in order to address these issues. One of the foremost obstacles pertains to the direct synthesis of ammonia, bypassing the requirement for an intermediate stage involving hydrogen generation. The synthesis of ammonia directly without an intermediate H2  generation stage represents a noteworthy advancement in the effort to reduce the cost associated with ammonia production. Another significant strategy entails the endorsement of green ammonia manufacturing inside nations abundant in renewable energy resources. In the global energy utilisation, the incorporation of green ammonia can contribute to limiting the atmospheric temperature increase in accordance to the IEA expectations (below 1.5 °C), while also making a significant contribution to the implementation of a zero-carbon emission energy strategy [23] . The findings of a research investigation examining the utilisation of ammonia in maritime transportation indicate that the utilisation of green ammonia derived from solar energy results in a substantial decrease of 45.4 % in CO2  emissions. This reduction is observed when the fuel energy fraction of ammonia is 95 %. Additionally, it was observed that the use of ammonia derived from wind energy leads to a 50 % reduction in CO2 emissions when the fuel energy fraction is 60 %. Moreover, the utilisation of green ammonia derived from wind energy aligns with the established objective for the year 2050 by delivering a substantial decrease of 79.2 % in carbon dioxide emissions when employed as a fuel energy component of 95 %. Nevertheless, the adoption of green ammonia appears to be less attractive until its cost is reduced to a justifiable extent [186 ]. One of the most crucial policies entails the reduction of substantial cost disparities between conventional and green ammonia production. The infrastructure of green ammonia is also subject to numerous technical constraints [66] . Similar to other industries, cost is one of the major issues in the implementation of green ammonia technologies. Regrettably, the cost is nearly four times greater than that of conventional ammonia. Hence, it is imperative to establish rules that consider the financial implications associated with the allocation of reserved carbon dioxide emissions in the context of utilising green ammonia. Moreover, it is imperative to adopt a comprehensive and secure policy approach in order to effectively address the challenges associated with the transportation and storage of green ammonia [6] , which will lay a platform for commercialization of green ammonia in near future. Renewable ammonia can be a desirable alternative in current energy systems like internal combustion engines and power generation. The non-linear and variable nature of renewable energy makes it crucial to deploy green ammonia at a conventional, decentralised level for these applications. Conventional systems that rely on grid electricity or fossil fuels must have a consistent energy supply. Hence, it is imperative to implement suitable energy storage systems to effectively incorporate ammonia-based energy supply [203 ]. Moreover, the implementation of extensive ammonia facilities, storage infrastructure, and transportation systems has the potential to produce electricity for the power grid or serve as a source of fuel for marine transportation. A technique like this can facilitate the seamless integration of conventional and green ammonia-based systems. The energy system is crucial and fundamental in the integration of renewable energy sources for providing heat and power, facilitating the shift towards a sustainable society. Hence, it is important to construct energy systems that rely on environmentally friendly and sustainable sources, while also incorporating efficient storage and transportation systems, in order to successfully accomplish the objectives of energy efficiency, sustainable development, and smart cities. Renewable energy conversion systems, like solar PV and wind, exclusively generate electrical energy. In contrast, solar concentrated collectors and biomass systems have the capability to produce both thermal and electrical energy. Furthermore, in order to ensure a consistent and consistent provision of various energy sources, it is essential to have storage and transportation systems and technologies in place. Various research in the literature have explored the integration of renewable energy sources, including wind, sun, biomass, and geothermal, to provide energy for different uses [204 ]. Nevertheless, a comprehensive investigation will be conducted to examine the function of green ammonia-based systems through active research. Ammonia offers several benefits as an energy storage and transport medium. It is dependable, inexpensive, and has high energy density. In addition to providing direct heat, hydrogen, and electricity, ammonia has the potential to play a significant role in the future energy scenario. The transformation of reactive nitrogen constituents, such as ammonia, has played a significant role in shaping the worldwide energy panorama. Approximately 80 % of ammonia production is mostly allocated for use in fertilizers, but it also has usage in direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFC) and as hydrogen energy storage vectors. The global issue of reactive nitrogen accumulation in the atmosphere is a result of this phenomenon [205 ]. Without the application of N-fertiliser, around 30 % of the global food crops would be lost [65] . Simultaneously, the rising pattern in production and utilisation has resulted in several environmental issues, including global acidification, ozone depletion, eutrophication, and climate change [92,121 ]. The progress in developing technologies for producing environmental-friendly ammonia, the current state of technical demonstrations and commercialization of these technologies, and the evaluation of costs, CO2 emissions, and energy efficiency of different ammonia production methods, are highlighting the importance of global cooperation in achieving the goal of decarbonization by 2050 [206 ]. There has been a growing interest in constructing decentralised energy systems that utilise hydrogen and ammonia storage to maintain a balanced operation. The need for diversification of energy production directions and sources of energy supply is more significant in light of the current global energy crisis and escalating energy prices [207 ]. Regarding the level of cooperation among nations, it was noted that North American and European countries exhibit a comparatively elevated degree of international collaboration when it comes to hydrogen-based distributed energy systems. Countries in South America, Africa, East Asia, and Oceania seem to have a diminished degree of international collaboration. To foster collaboration among the aforementioned countries, it is imperative to execute multiple simultaneous measures [208 ]. The phases involve forming regional alliances, enhancing communication networks, investigating possibilities for financial assistance or collaborative funding of initiatives and investments, and advocating for the alignment of strategies among countries within each region.   7 Conclusion A widely recognized carbon-free fuel is green ammonia in recent times. Ammonia produced by the Haber-Bosch process from renewable sources has find its application in various sectors i.e., hydrogen energy carrier, fertilizer, electricity, and heating. An extensive review of literature dealing with the application of ammonia was analysed and discussed in this review. To begin with, the importance of ammonia as an energy carrier molecule or hydrogen energy-carrier in the renewable fuel sector, Power-to-ammonia-to-power (P2A2P) system, and the involvement of green ammonia to SDGs was reviewed. Further, technological challenges and the environmental impact of green ammonia in making a feasible fuel were given in-detail. The difficulty of separating unreacted components and the ensuing inferior ammonia production under low-pressure circumstances are areas of the green ammonia process where knowledge gap exists and therefore, efficient and highly selective alternative catalysts need to be investigated to solve this limitation. Significant challenges in the areas of economics, finance, technology, and societal acceptance must be addressed in order to advance this concept. Hence, policy assistance is necessaryto facilitate the elimination or reduction of these hurdles, so enabling the transformation of green ammonia into a feasible manufacturing technique. Furthermore, considering ammonia as an energy carrier, it is urgent to implement appropriate policy measures to effectively address the challenges associated with the transportation and storage of green ammonia.
