                  Ecosystem services (ESs) and their demands from people are closely related to human well-being (HWB). Understanding of the influential paths of ecosystem services on human well-being is significant to sustainable landscape management. This study explored the supply of ecosystem services and the ecosystem service supply-demand relationships (i.e. the ecological supply-demand ratio, ESDR) in the Central and Western Inner Mongolia, as well as HWB by combining the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and the sustainable development goals of the United Nations (SDGs). A structural equation model (SEM) was built to quantify the influential paths of the ESs on the HWB. The results indicated that: (1) The HWB was improved during 2000–2018. (2) The supporting services promoted the provisioning services and the regulating services directly. (3) The provisioning services and the regulating services had positive direct influences on the HWB, and also affected the HWB through the ESDR indirectly. The combination of the supporting services and the ESDR presented a panorama of the influential paths of ecosystem services on the HWB and promoted the understanding of the driving mechanisms. Assessments on the ESs, the HWB in the context of SDGs, and their influential paths were instructive for decision-making towards sustainable landscape management.

Beijing Normal University No. 19 XinJieKouWai Street Beijing 100875 China       Editor: Fernando A.L. Pacheco Ecosystem services (ESs) and their demands from people are closely related to human well-being (HWB). Understanding of the influential paths of ecosystem services on human well-being is significant to sustainable landscape management. This study explored the supply of ecosystem services and the ecosystem service supply-demand relationships (i.e. the ecological supply-demand ratio, ESDR) in the Central and Western Inner Mongolia, as well as HWB by combining the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and the sustainable development goals of the United Nations (SDGs). A structural equation model (SEM) was built to quantify the influential paths of the ESs on the HWB. The results indicated that: (1) The HWB was improved during 2000–2018. (2) The supporting services promoted the provisioning services and the regulating services directly. (3) The provisioning services and the regulating services had positive direct influences on the HWB, and also affected the HWB through the ESDR indirectly. The combination of the supporting services and the ESDR presented a panorama of the influential paths of ecosystem services on the HWB and promoted the understanding of the driving mechanisms. Assessments on the ESs, the HWB in the context of SDGs, and their influential paths were instructive for decision-making towards sustainable landscape management.

Ecosystem services usually refer to the benefits that people directly or indirectly obtain from an ecosystem, including provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services (Costanza et al., 1997 ; MA, 2005 ). As vital links between human society and nature, ecosystem services, such as food production, water supply, and climate regulation, usually have direct or indirect influences on human well-being (HWB) (Bennett et al., 2015 ; Howe et al., 2014 ). Exploring the quantitative relationships between ecosystem services (ESs) and HWB is essential for the understanding of the ecological mechanisms behind the influential paths and the decision-making towards sustainable landscape management (Felipe-Lucia and Comín, 2015 ; Wegner and Pascual, 2011 ; Wu, 2013 ). The MA provided an early description of the links between ESs and HWB qualitatively (MA, 2005 ). Moreover, quantitative analyses were conducted to present the relationships between ESs and HWB. For example, Iniesta-Arandia et al. (2014)  collected stakeholders' perceptions of provisioning, regulating and cultural services in the semiarid watersheds of southeastern Spain, and used the Pearson correlation analysis to explore the relationships between these ESs and the subjective HWB from the domains of the MA. Ma et al. (2021)  evaluated the HWB from the perspectives of basic material, health, relation, and security under the MA framework, and found that clean water and air improved farmers' basic material whereas tourism services raised farmers' health in Qinling Region. Land use changes usually affect ESs through modifying the biophysical structure and the functions of the ecological system, and then change human well-being (Dong et al., 2021 ; Pires de Souza Araujo et al., 2021 ). Zhang et al. (2021)  assessed the HWB from the five domains of the MA, and linked demographic factors, economic factors, land use changes, and ecosystem services with the HWB in Uxin quantitatively. The results suggested that an increase in grassland and farmland intensity promoted food production, forage, and fuelwood supply, and then improved the HWB indirectly. Hu et al. (2021)  evaluated human well-being using a comprehensive HWB index based on the MA framework, and found that the landscape fragmentation affected the HWB index in Xishuangbanna through changing key ecosystem services, such as water supply, climate regulation, and cultural services. Plenty of the above studies have adopted the MA framework to explore human well-being (e.g., Dong et al., 2021 ; Iniesta-Arandia et al., 2014 ; Hu et al., 2021 ; MA, 2005 ; Ma et al., 2021 ; Pires de Souza Araujo et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ). In addition to the MA framework, human well-being is also closely related to the sustainable development goals of the United Nations (SDGs), but the quantitative analysis of the HWB combining the SDGs and the MA frameworks is still deficient (Li et al., 2022 ). The MA framework is an important official foundation for human well-being, while the adoption of the SDGs provides an insight into detailed and multidimensional human well-being, as well as the sustainable conditions of the economy, society, and environment. Therefore, the combination of the MA and the SDGs frameworks for the HWB quantification can provide an important guideline for promoting regional economic, social and environmental management. Secondly, although some quantitative studies have explored the direct influences of provisioning, regulating and cultural services on human well-being (e.g., Iniesta-Arandia et al., 2014 ; Hu et al., 2021 ; Ma et al., 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ), the indirect influences of supporting services, such as net primary productivity, on human well-being were rarely detected through quantitative approaches. Besides, some studies have explored the direct links between the HWB and the ecosystem service demands or the supply-demand relationships, such as the ecological supply-demand ratio (ESDR), but the influential paths about how ecosystem services affect the HWB through human demands indirectly were rarely built (Ketema et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2020 ; Wei et al., 2018 ). Including the supporting services and the ecosystem service supply-demand relationships (e.g., ESDR) into the quantitative influential path analysis of the ESs on the HWB is vital to improve the understanding of how the ecosystem services affect human well-being in direct and indirect ways, and then support the decision-making towards regional sustainable development from a global view. The aims of this paper were to improve the panoramic understanding of the driving mechanisms of the ESs on the HWB, and to support the localized suggestions in sustainable landscape management. To accomplish them, we (1) mapped the supply of key ESs during 2000–2018 (including the key supporting services) and the ESDR for the ecosystem service supply-demand relationships; (2) evaluated the HWB through combing the MA and the SDGs frameworks; (3) quantified the direct and indirect influential paths of the ESs on the HWB through a structural equation model (SEM), which integrated the supply of the ESs, the ESDR, and the HWB.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area The Central and Western Inner Mongolia includes five cities of the Inner Mongolia (Ulanqab, Baotou, Hohhot, Bayannur, and Ordos), covering an area of 250,563 km2  (Fig. 1  ). The study area is facing serious contradictions between the economic development and the conservation of the fragile environment, and the problems are different in different cities. Therefore, and it is a typical site to carry out the studies related to sustainable landscape management. The Central and Western Inner Mongolia dominated over a half GDP and population of the totality in the Inner Mongolia. Nevertheless, the region is under a typical temperate semiarid and arid continental monsoon climate with the annual mean precipitation for the whole region being about 100–500 mm. The annual mean water supply in the whole study area (33 km3 ) is far below the annual human need for water (51 km3 ), and the water scarcity causes a great threat to regional sustainable development. Hohhot is the capital of Inner Mongolia with higher GDP, which relies on the large milk businesses, while the GDP in Baotou relies on the steel and iron industry. However, the industries cause heavy pollution and environmental disruption. Besides, there are serious land deterioration and desertification in Ordos and Bayannur, which are mainly covered by unused land (barren land, everglade, saline-alkali land, Gobi, and sandy land). The land is dominated by sandy topsoil, which usually leads to soil erosion and sand storms. The coal industry in Ordos and the improper farming in Bayannur also aggravate water scarcity and soil erosion. Ulanqab has a developed meat business due to abundant grassland resources, but the GDP in this city is relatively low.  2.2 Quantifying ecosystem services 2.2.1 The supply and demand of ecosystem services With the aim of providing a guideline to relieve the contradictions in this semi-arid region, we quantified the supply of regional key ecosystem services related to the economic development or serious environmental problems. To be specific, grain production (GP), meat production (MeP), and milk production (MiP) selected in this study are closely related to local GDP and resident life. Water yield (WY) is regarded as an indicator of water scarcity, and the supply of soil conservation (SCS) and the supply of sand fixation (SFS) are related to soil erosion and sand storms (Hao et al., 2017 ; Qiao et al., 2018 ). Besides, in order to analyze the panoramic influential paths of the ESs on the HWB, we also included net primary productivity (NPP) and soil moisture of the three layers (from bottom to top: SM3, SM2, and SM1) that support the above services. The ecosystem services were classified into the provisioning services (WY, GP, MeP, and MiP), the regulating services (SCS and SFS), and the supporting services (NPP, SM1, SM2, and SM3) according to the MA (2005) . The classification was used in the SEM as well. GP, MeP, and MiP were derived from the statistical data, while NPP, SM1, SM2, SM3, WY SCS, and SFS were simulated using the biophysical models. The biophysical models can provide large-extent results with long time series, and give an insight into the ecological mechanisms behind (e.g., Potter et al., 1993 ; Wigmosta, 1994 ), rather than predict the ESs simply by the statistical relationships from the Artificial Neural Networks or the linear regression methods (e.g., Alizadeh et al., 2018 ; Kouadri et al., 2021 ). Besides, we also quantified the provisioning service demands (water demand (WD), grain demand (GD), meat demand (MeD), and milk demand (MiD)) and the regulating service demands (the demand of soil conservation (SCD) and the demand of sand fixation (SFD)) for the analysis of the ecosystem service supply-demand relationships. NPP was simulated under pixel scale using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) as the following (Potter et al., 1993 ):(1) NPP = F SOL NDVI  × ε    where NPP is net primary productivity (g C/m2 ); SOL is the total solar radiation (MJ/m2 ) from the radiation data; NDVI is the normalized difference vegetation index from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product(MOD13Q1); and ε is the light utility efficiency calculated with the temperature and precipitation data as the inputs (Zhu et al., 2007 ). The station data of radiation, temperature, and precipitation were from the Chinese Meteorological Science Data Sharing Service System. Water yield and soil moisture of the three layers were simulated under pixel scale using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) (Wigmosta, 1994 ). For this physically based hydrology model, we used the meteorological station data (air temperature, incoming shortwave radiation, incoming longwave radiation, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed) from the Chinese Meteorological Science Data Sharing Service System, the soil texture classification map from the Harmonized World Soil Database, the elevation from the digital elevation model (DEM), and the land use maps (including the categories of farmland, forestland, grassland, water body, construction land, and unused land) from the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center as the essential inputs. We also set the essential vegetation and soil parameters, such as field capacity and wilting point, according to the land use types and the soil texture classification (Huang et al., 2019 ; Naz et al., 2018 ). Moreover, the DHSVM was improved by the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) products of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Albedo, which can avoid the drawbacks in the field measurements or classic static parameters (Huang et al., 2019 ). The reliability of results was evaluated by the root mean squares error (RMSE), percent bias (PBIAS), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between simulated streamflow in the DHSVM and observed streamflow in the Hydrological Yearbook (Moriasi et al., 2007 ; Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970 ). Water demand was quantified from industrial, domestic, agricultural, and ecological perspectives (Chen et al., 2019 ; Cui et al., 2019 ):(2) WD = W industrial  + W domestic  + W agricultural  + W ecological     where WD is the spatial mean water demand (per unit area) (mm) under city scale; Windustrial  and Wdomestic  are the industrial and domestic demands, which were based on industrial GDP and population from the Statistical Yearbook of Inner Mongolia; Wagricultural  and Wecological  are the agricultural and ecological demands, which were calculated using the approach suggested by Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (Allen et al., 1998 ; FAO, 1998 ). The productions of grain, meat, and milk were the statistical data under city scale, which were obtained from the Statistical Yearbook of Inner Mongolia during 2000–2018. The demands of grain, meat, and milk were calculated as the following:(3) FD i  = POP × C i     where FDi  is the demand of food i (t) under city scale; POP is the population from the Statistical Yearbook of Inner Mongolia; Ci  is the personal consumption standard of food i, which was acquired from the statistical yearbook or the previous studies (Cui et al., 2019 ). The supply of soil conservation was calculated through subtracting the actual soil erosion by rainfall from the potential erosion under pixel scale, and the demand of soil conservation is the actual soil erosion by rainfall under pixel scale. Both of them were calculated by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) (Renard et al., 1991 ) as the following:(4) SCS = R × K × LS × 1 − C × P     SCD = R × K × LS × C × P       where SCS and SCD are the supply and demand of soil conservation (t/ha), respectively; R is the rainfall-runoff erosivity factor calculated by the station precipitation data; K is the soil erodibility factor calculated with the soil texture (topsoil sand/silt/clay/organic carbon/calcium carbonate fraction) data from the Harmonized World Soil Database; LS is the dimensionless slope length and steepness factor derived from the DEM; C is the dimensionless vegetation cover factor calculated by the vegetation coverage fraction based on MOD13Q1 (The higher vegetation coverage fraction is, the lower C is.); and P is the dimensionless supporting practice assigned by land use types according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture which was lower in farmland and was zero in construction land (Hao et al., 2017 ). The supply of sand fixation was calculated through subtracting the actual soil erosion by wind from the potential erosion under pixel scale, and the demand of soil conservation is the actual soil erosion by wind under pixel scale. Both of them were calculated using the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) (Bilbro et al., 2000 ) as the following:(5) SFD = 2 x / s r  2  × Q maxr  × exp − x / s r    2      Q maxr  = 109.8 × WF × EF × SCF × K × COG     s r  = 150.71 × WF × EF × SCF × K × COG   − 0.3711     SL q  = 2 x / s q  2  × Q maxq  × exp − x / s q    2      Q maxq  = 109.8 × WF × EF × SCF × K     s q  = 150.71 × WF × EF × SCF × K   − 0.3711     SFS = SL q  − SFD             where SFS and SFD are the supply and demand of sand fixation (kg/m2 ), respectively; SLq  is potential soil loss by wind (kg/m2 ); Qmaxr  is the actual maximum transport capacity; sr  is the length of the critical field (m); Qmaxq  is the potential maximum transport capacity; sq  is the length of the potential critical field (m); x is the distance to the upwind edge of the field, and was set as 50 m (Hao et al., 2017 ; Huang and Yu, 2021 ), WF is the climate factor calculated with the meteorological station data (e.g., air temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) as inputs; EF and SCF are the soil erodibility factor and the soil crust factor, respectively, both of which were calculated based on the soil texture data; K is the soil roughness calculated by the land use types, the soil texture (topsoil clay/organic), and the station precipitation data; and COG is the integrated vegetation factor calculated with the land use types and the vegetation coverage fraction based on the MOD13Q1 products. The meteorological station data used in this study were interpolated into 250 m ∗ 250 m using the ArcGIS tool before the calculation of a specific ecosystem service. All the grid data were processed with the UTM projection coordinate system, and resampled at a spatial resolution of 250 m ∗ 250 m.  2.2.2 Ecological supply-demand ratio The ecological supply-demand ratio links the supply and demand of a specific ecosystem service, which reveals the nature of surpluses or shortfalls (Li et al., 2016 ). The equation is as the following:(6) ESDR = ESS − ESD   / ESS max  + ESD max    / 2      where ESDR is the ecological supply-demand ratio of a specific provisioning service or regulating service under city scale; ESS and ESD are the spatial mean supply and demand of this ecosystem service under city scale, respectively; ESSmax  and ESDmax  are the maximum values for ESS and ESD among the five cities during the period of nineteen years, respectively. A positive ESDR indicates a surplus, zero indicates a balance, and a negative ESDR indicates a shortfall.   2.3 Assessing human well-being In order to assess human well-being, we established an evaluation index system combining the SDGs and the MA frameworks in this study (Table 1  ). To be specific, we revised the MA framework (MA, 2005 ) with the consideration of the SDGs (United Nations, 2015 ; United Nations, 2019 ), the regional characteristics, the previous studies, and the data availability. Then, we regarded the revised MA framework as the base to organize the sub-components of the SDGs and the three comprehensive sub-components. In addition to basic material, security, and health in the MA framework, income & expenditure was included as a revised MA sub-component, since it is an essential guarantee for individual material well-being, which is also related to the SDG 1. Education & technology was included as a revised MA sub-component, since it contributes to individual mental fulfillment (Wang et al., 2017c ), which is also related to the SDG 4 and SDG 9, but it experiences regional imbalance in the Western China (including the study area). Employment & insurance was included, because it improves public stability and individual esteem, and contributes to good social relations (Hu et al., 2021 ). Besides, we dropped the freedom of choice and action due to the deficiency of the data with long time series. Moreover, we detailed each revised MA sub-component with the sub-components of the SDGs, which provided an insight into the detailed and multidimensional human well-being and sustainable conditions (Table 1 ). Specifically, income & expenditure included SDG 1.1 and SDG 8.1 (related to regional income). Basic material included SDG 2.3, SDG 2.a, SDG 6.1, SDG 7.1, and SDG 11.1. Security included SDG 9.1, SDG11.7, and SDG 15.1. Health included SDG 2.1, SDG 3.6, SDG 3.b, and SDG 3.c. Education & Technology included SDG 4.3, SDG 4.c, SDG 9.5, and SDG 9.c. Employment & insurance included SDG 1.3, SDG 5.5, and SDG 8.5. With the consideration of data availability, the regional characteristics, and the reference of Shao et al. (2021) , the sub-components of the SDGs were localized with the indicators or the weighted summation of the multiple indicators from the Statistical Yearbook of Inner Mongolia (Table A.1). We also provided a general quantification of the HWB by combing the revised MA sub-components into three comprehensive sub-components (material fulfillment, health & security, and mental fulfillment) with the reference of Hu et al. (2021) . The adoption of the three comprehensive sub-components into the SEM could also make the results of the influential paths more reliable than the revised MA sub-components or the sub-components of the SDGs. Material fulfillment was quantified as the weighted summation of income & expenditure and basic material. Health and security were summarized together with the weights, since resource security, such as public green areas, is closely related to life health. Mental fulfillment was quantified as the weighted summation of education & technology and employment & insurance, since both of them contribute to the individual mental well-being and the achievement of self-values. The revised MA sub-components were calculated as the weighted summation of the inclusive sub-components of the SDGs. In this study, the weights were determined using the entropy weight method (Okada, 1978 ). The method relies on the information amount from the inclusive sub-categories (e.g., SDG 1.1 and SDG 8.1) and their impact degrees on the corresponding integrated-category (e.g., Income & Expenditure), which can avoid the errors from subjective judgments. The method has been commonly used in the evaluation of the HWB (e.g., Hu et al., 2021 ). Taking the calculation for a sub-component of the SDGs as an example, the values of a specific inclusive indicator among the five cities during 2000–2018 were linearly normalized to 0–1 (without measurement unit) before the weight determination for this indicator. The values of a positive indicator (with a direction of “+”) were normalized as the following:(7) f i , j   = y i , j   − y min    / y max  − y min       where fi,j  is the normalized value of sample j in the indicator I; and ymax  and ymin  represent the maximum and minimum values of the indicator i, respectively. The values for a negative indicator (with a direction of “-”) (e.g., number of traffic accidents) were linearly normalized by subtracting fi,j  from 1. The entropy of the indicator i was calculated as the following:(8) D i  = K ∑ j = 1  m  Y i , j   × ln Y i , j         where K and Yi,j  were calculated as the following:(9) K = − 1 / ln m    Y i , j   = f i , j   / ∑ j = 1  m  f i , j         where m is the total number of samples, which is 95 in this study. The entropy weight of the indicator i was calculated as the following:(10) W i  = E i  / ∑ i = 1  n  E i     where n is the total number of the localized indicators in a sub-component of the SDGs, and Ei  was calculated through subtracting Di  from 1. The weights for the sub-components of the SDGs and the revised MA sub-components were determined through similar calculations, and the normalizations for these sub-components were consistent with that of a positive indicator. The weights for the localized indicators, the sub-components of the SDGs, and the revised MA sub-components were listed in the right columns next to them, respectively (Table.1 ). Based on the information from the National Bureau of Statistics and local conditions, we defined the standard lines of high, medium, and low levels in material fulfillment, health & security, mental fulfillment, and the sub-components of the SDGs.  2.4 Exploring influential paths of ecosystem services on human well-being The SEM is a multivariate statistical method, which can explore logical relationships and complex influential paths with a limited sample size (Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1982 ; Jöreskog and Moustaki, 2001 ). With the consideration of the limited sample size and the ecological mechanisms, we built a SEM to quantify the influential paths of the ESs on the HWB (Fig. 2  ). In the theoretical SEM, the ecosystem service supplies and their ESDR were classified into the latent variables named the supply of the supporting services, the supply of the provisioning services, the supply of the regulating services, the ESDR of the provisioning services, and the ESDR of the regulating services as above. The three comprehensive sub-components of the HWB (material fulfillment, health & security, and mental fulfillment) were binned into a latent variable named human well-being in Fig. 2 . This study presented the hypotheses as below:H1 The supply of the supporting services contributed to the supply of the provisioning services directly, and also contributed to the supply of the regulating services directly.  H2 The supply of the provisioning services and the supply of the regulating services interacted with each other.  H3 The supply of the provisioning services contributed to the ESDR of the provisioning services directly, and the supply of the regulating services contributed to the ESDR of the regulating services directly.  H4 Both the supply of the provisioning services and the supply of the regulating services affected human well-being directly.  H5 Both the ESDR of the provisioning services and the ESDR of the regulating services affected human well-being directly.  H6 The supply of the provisioning services affected human well-being through the ESDR indirectly.  H7 The supply of the regulating services affected human well-being through the ESDR indirectly.   The hypotheses were checked by the structural model component of the SEM:(11) η = β × η + Γ × ξ + ζ    where η is an endogenous latent variable, such as human well-being; ξ is an exogenous latent variable, such as the supply of the provisioning services; Γ is the effect of ξ on η, which is divided into direct effects (e.g., the influence of the supply of the provisioning services on human well-being directly) and indirect effects (e.g., the influence of the supply of the provisioning services on human well-being through ESDR), both of which can be measured using the path coefficients and their significances (Byrne, 2009 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ); β is the relationship between η; and ζ is the residual error, such as e1–e5 (Fig. 2 ). Meanwhile, the measurement model components of the SEM explored the contributions of a specific ecosystem service supply, ESDR or HWB comprehensive sub-component on its corresponding latent variable:(12) Χ = Λ Χ  × ξ + δ   Y = Λ Y  × η + ε       where ξ and η are the exogenous and endogenous latent variables as mentioned above; X is the vector of the observed variables in ξ, such as water yield, grain production, meat production, and milk production in the supply of the provisioning services; Y is the vector of the observed variables in η, such as material fulfillment, health & security, and mental fulfillment in human well-being; ΛX  and ΛY  are the factor loading matrices of the observed variables on their latent variables; δ and ε are the random error, such as e11–e63 (Fig. 2 ). In this study, we used the collinearity diagnostics (Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) ≤ 10) to check the redundancy of the observed variables to each latent variable, and used the mathematical transformation algorithms (e.g., logarithm transformation) to improve normality. The reliability of the results was checked using the Ratio of Chi-Square and Degrees of Freedom (CMIN/DF), Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI), Adjusted Goodness-of-Fit Index (AGFI), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) in the Amos tool (Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1982 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ).   3 Results 3.1 Changes in ecosystem services As shown in Fig. 3   and A.1, NPP exhibited high values in the eastern forestland during 2000–2018, such as Hohhot, but it was low in the western and northern unused land like Bayannur. The simulated results of the DHSVM were reliable as the RMSE was <2.0 (being 1.04), the absolute value of PBIAS was <10 % (being −8.30 %), and NSE was >0.80 (being 0.87), respectively. Soil moisture of the three layers (SM1, SM2, and SM3) and water yield had similar spatial patterns with precipitation, declining from the southeast to the northwest. Besides, the areas covered by sandy topsoil usually showed low soil moisture (Fig. 3 ). For the five cities, Hohhot and Ulanqab had higher water yield than others, while the city differences for the three soil moisture were less significant (Fig. A.1). The ESDR indicated that most cities experienced water shortfalls during the period. The problem was less serious in Hohhot and Baotou, and they even experienced a water surplus in some years (Fig. 4  ). During 2000–2018, Bayannur had the highest grain production (1.43–2.62 million tons), Ulanqab had the highest annual meat production (0.08–0.33 million tons), while Hohhot had the highest milk production (0.23–3.11 million tons) (Fig. 3  and A.1). The positive values of the ESDR indicated the surpluses of these foods, among which the surplus of milk in Hohhot was extremely significant (Fig. 4 ). In Fig. 3  and A.1, high soil conservation was usually accompanied with high precipitation and slopes, which was found in the northeast area, such as Hohhot and Ulanqab. Hohhot and Ulanqab experienced the surpluses of soil conservation in most years, while the other three cities experienced the shortfalls (Fig. 4 ). High sand fixation was in the western and southern areas with sandy topsoil, such as Ordos and Bayannur, since they had higher potential soil erosion by wind (Fig. 3  and A.1). The positive values of the ESDR indicated the surpluses of sand fixation in the five cities (Fig. 4 ).  3.2 Changes in human well-being In Fig. 5  , the three comprehensive sub-components of the HWB all exhibited upward trends during 2000–2018. For material fulfillment, Ordos was the best city as it had higher per capita incomes (SDG1.1), higher GDP (SGD8.1), and a larger living area (SDG11.1) than other cities. Material fulfillment in Ordos reached the medium in 2003, and then entered a high level in 2009. Hohhot and Baotou followed behind, because they had higher values in the public access to tap water (SDG6.1) and gas (SDG7.1). Material fulfillment in the two cities entered a high level around 2012. Ulanqab had the relatively worst material fulfillment over the period, which was attributed to the lower values for most SDGs in this part (Fig. 5  and A.3). For health & security, the best Hohhot entered a high level in 2007, with more highways (SGD 9.1) and forests (SDG15.1) than the other cities. Baotou ranked second because of more per capita beds (SDG3.b) and medical technical personnel (SDG3.c) in health institutions there, and health & security in Baotou reached a high level in 2016 (Fig. 5  and A.3). Hohhot had the best mental fulfillment, which was attributed to the higher values for education (SDG 4.3), expenditure of state-owned research, technical and literature institutions (SDG 9.5), and female worker ratio (SDG 1.3) than the other cities. Mental fulfillment in Hohhot entered a high level in 2003. Baotou followed behind with higher SDG 4.3 and SDG 1.3. While the other three cities have not reached a high level during the period (Fig. 5  and A.3).  3.3 Influential paths of ecosystem services on human well-being 3.3.1 Effects in the structural model component The VIFs in the supply of the supporting services, the supply of the regulating services, the supply of the provisioning services, the ESDR of the regulating services, the ESDR of the provisioning services, and human well-being were all <10.0 in the collinearity diagnostics (Table A.2). The results of the SEM were reliable, since CMIN/DF was <2.0 (being 1.979), GFI and AGFI were both >0.9 (being 0.924 and 0.901), and RMSEA was <0.1 (being 0.079), respectively. As shown in Fig. 6   and Table A.3, the supply of the supporting services promoted both the supply of the provisioning services and the supply of the regulating services directly, validating H1. The supply of the provisioning services and the supply of the regulating services interacted with each other directly, which validated H2. The supply of the provisioning services and the supply of the regulating services had direct positive influences on their EDSR, respectively. Thus, H3 was accepted. The supply of the provisioning services and the supply of the regulating services also improved human well-being directly, verifying H4. The ESDR of the provisioning services and the ESDR of the regulating services had positive direct effects on human well-being, verifying H5. For human well-being, the supply and the ESDR of the provisioning services exhibited much larger effects on human well-being than those of the regulating services. Meanwhile, the supply of the provisioning services and the supply of the regulating services also improved human well-being indirectly through their ESDR, validating H6 and H7. Besides, the supply of the supporting services affected human well-being indirectly by changing the supply and the ESDR of the other two services (Fig. 6  and Table A.3).  3.3.2 Drivers in the measurement model component For the supply of the supporting services, NPP and the bottom soil moisture were slightly more important than the surface and middle soil moisture. For the supply and the ESDR of the provisioning services, water and milk exhibited much larger importance than grain and meat. For the supply and the ESDR of the regulating services, the weight difference between soil conservation and sand fixation was small, indicating both of them were important for the region. For the three comprehensive sub-components of the HWB, health & security and mental fulfillment were more important than material fulfillment in the study area (Table A.4).    4 Discussion 4.1 Driving mechanisms behind the influential paths There were significant positive effects of the supporting services on the regulating services and the provisioning services (Fig. 6  and Table A.3). Forestland had higher NPP and vegetation cover, which contributed greatly to soil conservation and sand fixation through reducing actual soil erosion by rainfall and wind, respectively. Grass NPP also provided forage for animal husbandry, and then promoted milk and meat production in the study area (Liu et al., 2020 ). Meanwhile, higher soil moisture represented more rainfalls preserved in the soil layers, which implied an increase in water yield. It also exhibited positive influences on soil conservation and sand fixation through improving the soil environment. More importantly, the provisioning services were regarded as the final services that promoted human well-being (Fig. 6  and Table A.3), which was consistent with other previous conclusions (e.g., Daw et al., 2011 ; Ketema et al., 2021 ; MA, 2005 ; Wang et al., 2017a ). Water yield was one of the most important provisioning services in this semiarid region, and it supported human well-being through improving basic material, such as tap water (SDG 6.1). It was also an essential resource for agricultural and industrial production, which contributed to GDP (SDG 8.1) and other HWB sub-components supported by the economy, such as education. Besides, water improved resource security through supporting forests, grasses, as well as public green spaces (SDG 11.7 and SDG 15.1). Food production was a crucial guarantee for human well-being, since grain, meat, and milk maintained the life and health of the residents (SDG 2.1). The conclusion was also supported by the findings of Ciftcioglu (2017) . Meanwhile, the disposable income of rural farmers (SDG 1.1) relied on milk and meat production in Hohhot and Ulanqab, as well as grain production in Bayannur. The provisioning services also affected human well-being through the ESDR indirectly, and the surpluses of these services promoted human well-being significantly (Fig. 6  and Table A.3). Although the conclusions about how the regulating services affect human well-being were different in different studies (Ketema et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2017a ; Wei et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2021 ), soil conservation and sand fixation exhibited positive effects on human well-being in the long term (Fig. 6  and Table A.3). For example, these services contributed directly to resource security, including SDG 11.7 and SDG 15.1. Besides, they also promoted human well-being through the ESDR indirectly. However, some studies found that the negative impacts of the imbalances between the ES supply and demand (the shortfalls of ESs) on human well-being should be noted (Wang et al., 2020 ; Wei et al., 2018 ). The previous studies indicated that the improvement of human well-being also had influences on ecosystem services. For example, the increases of forest coverage and grass coverage (SDG 15.1) directly promoted NPP, and then improved soil conservation and sand fixation according to the conclusions from Jiang et al. (2016)  and Wang et al. (2017b) . However, some studies showed that higher forest coverage led to larger vegetation evapotranspiration, and then reduced water yield (Huang and Yu, 2021 ). Besides, the power of agricultural machinery (SDG 2.a) could increase grain production.  4.2 Implications for sustainable landscape management Hohhot was a human well-being beneficial city with higher values in many sub-components of the SDGs than the other cities (Fig. A.3). It could be attributed to the larger milk industries (Fig. A.1), which was supported by higher NPP and water supply (Fig. 6  and Table A.3). However, the animal husbandry led to the shortfall of water and excessive carbon emission (Fig. 4  and A.2). Sustainable grazing and the recycling of waste resources, like turning livestock manure to methane or fertilizer, are valid solutions to reduce these pressures. As NPP directly promotes carbon sequestration (Eq. (A.1)), an increase in the coverage of drought-resistant plants is effective to improve natural carbon sinks in this semiarid region. Baotou was also human well-being beneficial with most sub-components of the SDGs at the top of the list (Fig. A.3). The HWB was supported by the steel and iron industries. Nevertheless, the improper production modes aggravated environmental pollution and excessive carbon emission (Fig. A.2). Environmental-friendly techniques with low energy consumption are needful in the production process, such as shaft furnaces with massive hydrogen. Besides, lower SDG3.6 indicated traffic safety problems (Fig. A.3), which should be relieved by humanized traffic planning. Ordos was human well-being beneficial, but ecological vulnerable. It had higher GDP (SDG 8.1) and individual incomes (SDG 1.1) than other cities (Fig. A.3), which relied on cashmere and mutton production. They were directly supported by water and grass NPP (Fig. 6  and Table A.3). However, the over-grazing and insufficient natural vegetation caused serious soil erosion by wind and a shortfall of water (Fig. 4  and A.1). As NPP and soil moisture contributed to the regulating services like sand fixation (Fig. 6 ), it is valid to balance sustainable grazing and ecological conservation. To be specific, introducing water-saving and saline-alkali tolerant grass and revising the unfavorable soil properties for the growth (e.g., high sand fraction) would be efficient to conserve the ecosystem there. Bayannur was vulnerable in both human well-being and environment. Most sub-components of the SDGs were at the bottom of the list (Fig. A.3). The HWB and economic development relied heavily on grain production. To improve the HWB, the techniques for high unit crop production and the popularization of the featured products should be promoted. On the other hand, improper cultivation and insufficient natural vegetation caused serious soil erosion by wind and water scarcity (Fig. 4  and A.1). With the positive influences of NPP and soil moisture on the regulating services (Fig. 6  and Table A.3), it is helpful to return the sandy farmland into the grassland using the drought-resistant and saline-alkali tolerant grass types. Besides, water-saving farming (e.g., drip irrigation) is effective to relieve water pressure there. Ulanqab was a human well-being vulnerable city with lower sub-components of the SDGs (e.g., GDP, individual incomes, and infrastructure) than the other cities (Fig. A.3). Nevertheless, the city had abundant desert steppe and volcanic landscape. Therefore, promoting eco-tourism with moderate eco-conservation policies is appropriate for optimizing the HWB. In addition, as meat production was one of the major paths to improve the HWB (Fig. 6  and Table A.3), the publicity and diversification of meat products should be implemented.  4.3 Innovations and limitations One of the innovations in this study was that we included the supporting services and the ecosystem service supply-demand relationships in the SEM to explore how the ecosystem services affected human well-being directly and indirectly, which improved the panoramic understanding of the quantitative influential paths. The SEM could provide a more complete “network” of the influential paths among multi variables with a limited sample size (Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1982 ). Besides, the weights in the measurement models indicated the relative importance of each ecosystem service. For example, water yield was of greater significance than the production of grain, meat, and milk in this semiarid area. Secondly, we accessed human well-being in the context of the SDGs, and considered regional characteristics when establishing the evaluation index system, such as localizing SDG 15.1 through combining grass coverage and forest coverage (Tables 1  and A.1). Integrating the ESs, the HWB, and the influential paths, we provided the localized suggestions for sustainable landscape management, which were suitable for adjusting the local industrial structure and solving ecological problems. Last but not the least, as the study area was a typical semiarid region with different contradictions between the economic development and the conservation of the fragile environment in the five cities, the diversified solutions were also instructive for other arid or semiarid regions to solve similar problems. In this study, we included key ecosystem services related to the economic development and serious ecological problems in the semiarid region, and the ESs from the biophysical models were reliable as they either passed the statistical tests or were consistent with the conclusions in the previous studies (e.g., Fu et al., 2005 ; Gong et al., 2014 ; Hao et al., 2017 ). Although the results of this study provided a solid foundation for the further analysis, there were still some limitations. Firstly, some other ecosystem services like cultural services may also contribute to human well-being and decision-making, but they were not assessed due to a deficiency of the data with long time series. Secondly, because of the limitations in spatial resolution and sample size (e.g., statistical data under city scale), the ecosystem services and human well-being had to be tied up in the SEM, such as “the supply of regulating services”. Substantial field measurements or surveys are needed to detail the influential paths of each ES on the HWB, and make spatially explicit landscape management schemes. In addition, the sensitivity tests of the key parameters in the biophysical models should be replenished in the future studies, which are helpful to make a more detailed landscape management scheme.   5 Conclusions The HWB in the study area exhibited an upward trend during 2000–2018, with higher values occurring in Hohhot, Baotou, and Ordos. In the SEM, the supporting services promoted both the provisioning services and the regulating services, and the provisioning services and the regulating services interacted with each other. The provisioning services and the regulating services had positive direct influences on human well-being, and they also improved human well-being through the ESDR indirectly. In general, the supply and the ESDR of the provisioning services contributed more to human well-being than those of the regulating services. Hohhot, Baotou, and Ordos were human well-being beneficial, but underwent excessive carbon emission or soil erosion. Ulanqab and Bayannur were characterized as human well-being vulnerable with lower economic development. Therefore, we provided the localized suggestions to solve the problems and promote sustainable landscape management.
