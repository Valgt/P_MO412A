                  Sustainable development goals (SDGs) are guidelines to improve the socio-economic and environmental worldwide situation caused by excessive fossil fuel use. These goals must be accomplished before 2030 by implementing a national sustainable development framework in all UN country members. Instead, biorefineries are the seed towards a more sustainable world since biomass upgrading into a series of value-added products and energy vectors can reduce current issues related to waste generation and climate change. Besides, biorefineries are the first step on the way to implement a bioeconomy. This review paper aims to elucidate the existing relation between biorefineries, bioeconomy, and the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of the technical requirements, challenges, and perspectives of biomass upgrading processes. In this way, this review paper includes a discussion about the biorefinery, bioeconomy, sustainable development, and sustainability concepts. Moreover, this paper elucidates how the implementation of biorefineries is linked to the SDGs accomplishment.

Table 1 Review of biorefinery definitions.     Authors Definition/concept Reference.   International Energy Agency – Task 42 Sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable products and energy (Cherubini et al., 2009 )  American National Renewable Energy Laboratory A biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, power, and chemicals from biomass. The biorefinery concept is analogous to today’s petroleum refineries, which produce multiple fuels and products from petroleum. Industrial biorefineries have been identified as the most promising route to the creation of a new domestic biobased industry (Moncada et al., 2016 )  Moncada, Aristizábal and Cardona A biorefinery is a complex system where biomass is integrally processed or fractionated to obtain more than one product, including bioenergy, biofuels, chemicals, and high value-added compounds that only can be extracted from bio-based sources (Moncada et al., 2016 )  Ganti S. Murthy A biorefinery is defined as a facility/cluster of facilities for processing biobased feedstocks into valuable products addressing the needs of diverse markets for fuels, feed, plastics, and other commodity chemicals in a sustainable manner. (Murthy, 2019 )     Table 2 Specific SDGs indicators where biorefineries and bioeconomy can impact directly.      SDG ID. Indicator How can biorefineries/bioeconomy contribute?   1 1.1.1 Proportion of population below the international poverty line. Small-scale biorefineries can promote the development of entrepreneurship opportunities to produce incomes and jobs.  1.4.1. Proportion of population living in households with access to basic services. Biomass conversion into energy vectors is a promising option to strengthen access to heat and power in rural and urban areas in the future. Moreover, biomass use in water purification plants.  2 2.3.1. Volume of production per labor unit by classes of farming/pastoral/forestry enterprise size Bioeconomy can increase the production rates of agricultural products by implementing sustainable agriculture practices (e.g., decrease agrochemicals use).  2.3.2 Average income of small-scale food producers. Small-scale biorefineries are the way to increase the incomes of farmers due to the conversion of non-marketable agricultural products.  2.4.1. Proportion of agricultural area under productive and sustainable agriculture. Agricultural waste and agro-industrial waste valorization can increase the agricultural area to produce more income for farmers. Moreover, sustainable agriculture can be applied to decrease the use of agrochemicals.  3 3.9.1. Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution. The use of biomass instead of fossil fuels as the main raw material can reduce air pollution at all levels. Besides, biorefineries environmental impact must be lower than current oil-based facilities.  3.9.3. Mortality rate attributed to unintentional poisoning. Biorefineries must be sustainable by definition. Thus, proper management of waste streams must be considered, and also risk and safety labor conditions must be promoted.  6 6.4.1. Change in water-use efficiency over time. Biorefineries can promote an increase in water-use efficiency to produce value-added products through mass integration. Moreover, these facilities can be designed considering water cycles.  7 7.1.1. Proportion of population with access to electricity Energy-driven biorefineries are a potential solution to provide reliable and affordable energy to rural and urban communities.  7.1.2. Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology. Decentralized energy production by implementing systems such as anaerobic digesters, gasifiers, and biodiesel internal combustion engines  8 8.4.1. Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP Biorefineries implementation can improve progressively using renewable resources (e.g., water, soil) to achieve a more sustainable production and consumption model.  9 9.3.1. Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value-added Small-scale processing of biomass sources can promote local employment and improve the socio-economic conditions of a rural zone through the commercialization of value-added products  9.5.2. Researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants Biorefineries require a progressive technology improvement to reach sustainability since more efficient processes decrease material and energy usage. Then, biorefineries implementation can increase the number of persons dedicated to research and develop new technologies.  12 12.3.1. Global food loss index Food losses can be reduced by introducing food waste biorefineries to produce high value-added products through extraction and conversion technologies. This type of biorefineries can be designed to have multiple raw materials or only upgrade one raw material from a specific productive chain (e.g., only upgrade avocado residues).  12.6.1 Number of companies publishing sustainability reports Renewable raw materials used to produce value-added products and energy vectors can promote the publication of sustainability reports. In an integral bioeconomy model, both producers and consumers are interested in knowing how products and services are obtained.

Keywords Sustainability  Biorefineries  Sustainable Development Goals  Bioeconomy    1 Introduction Economic, environmental, and social issues have arisen in developed and developing countries over time. These issues are attributed to several reasons, such as (i) most industrial products and additives are obtained using non-renewable resources via chemical synthesis (Naveenkumar and Baskar, 2021 ), (ii) the current economic model is based on a non-cyclic scheme (i.e., natural resources extraction → ansformation → distribution → consumption → disposal) producing large amounts of waste and pollutants (Brandão et al., 2021 ), (iii) population growth is decreasing the access to basic products for well-being (e.g., food and energy), and (iv) social inequality as a product of the application of non-beneficial economic policies to boost the growth of the lower and middle classes of society (i.e., rich people get richer and poor people to get poorer) (O’Sullivan, 2020 ). These problems have contributed to the environmental and human well-being detriment since scarce efforts have been implemented to mitigate these problems. For these reasons, international organizations have proposed several goals and guidelines to mitigate the negative effects caused by the excessive use of non-renewable resources. Nevertheless, the role of natural resources and the environment has not been reflected in the development of national and international policies (Heimann, 2019 ). The most prominent effort made by the UN is the creation of the 2030 agenda composed of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). In total, 17 SDGs were proposed to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the quality of life of everyone everywhere (Asadikia et al., 2021 ). All UN member states adopted the 2030 agenda in 2015 to be involved in sustainable development governmental. All the goals proposed by the SDGs should be understood as the result of many efforts addressed to encourage the use of renewable resources as the base to build a more sustainable production and consumption scheme. SDGs can be seen as a way to reach global sustainability. Nevertheless, a difference between sustainable development and sustainability must be made since these concepts are similar but different. Sustainable development was defined as “the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”  (Brundtland, 1991 ). Meanwhile, the sustainability concept should be considered a paradigm or ideal state where social, economic, and environmental considerations balance perfectly to pursue an improved quality of life. Thus, the word “sustainability” should be used to describe a long-term goal and describe the desired state of a system (e.g., a chemical process, a biorefinery, a city). The sustainability concept should not have a perfection or specific value meaning. It always corresponds to a holistic concept characterized by some kind of the performance reached based on the temporal or policy strategies defined by any person, state, enterprise, decision-makers, organization, etc. Then, the sustainability concept always represent the degree of advance based on any reference state overtime. The sustainability concept relies on the final state after implementing strategies to improve a system. Then, all the strategies adopted to improve the future (i.e., SDGs) can be considered sustainable development (a continuous idea), while sustainability results from sustainable development. In consequence, the bioeconomy is a necessary change to reach sustainability. Indeed, the bioeconomy is linked with the SDGs because several goals can be achieved by implementing renewable resources into all productive chains. Renewable resources have been profiled to decrease the environmental damage caused by fossil fuel use. Efforts addressed to supply a share of the global energy demand using wind and sunlight as energy sources have been implemented worldwide. Moreover, several researchers have proposed biomass to replace most products derived from the oil industry. Even biomass has been described as the most important pillar to change the traditional economic scheme to a bio-based economy. This renewable resource can be used to obtain different value-added products and energy vectors either in stand-alone processes or biorefineries (Solarte-Toro et al., 2018 ). In past years, the use of this renewable resource was sufficient to consider any biomass upgrading process as sustainable due to the avoided consumption of non-renewable resources (Moncada et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless, biorefineries are complex systems where biomass is upgraded using various inputs such as reagents, water, electricity, land, and labor (Cardona-Alzate et al., 2019 ). In addition, side-streams can cause different impacts on the environment. For these reasons, the only use of biomass instead of crude oil is a necessary but not sufficient condition to guarantee the sustainability of a process. Other aspects related to natural resources consumption, releases, job generation, local community impact, economic growth, and region incomes should be considered before improving the sustainability of a biomass upgrading process (i.e., the performance of a process in economic, environmental, and social aspects) (Koberg and Longoni, 2019 ). In this way, environmental, social, and economic perspectives are essential to define the sustainability of a biorefinery system. Biorefineries are just one of many ways to collaborate in sustainability improvement in the world. However, during the design and implementation, these biorefineries must consider the negative and positive impacts through objective analysis of several indicators corresponding to the overall sustainability assessment. Only after these calculations and analysis is it possible to avoid speculative concepts and even policies based on a wrong understanding of the role of biomass and its transformation into valuable products. Additionally, it is required that the designers could be familiarized with the relationship between these impacts (using indicators) and the world policies proposed today, for example, bioeconomy development strategies, circular economy, and sustainable development goals (SDGs). Then, biomass upgrading in biorefineries can be considered the seed to improve the current issues faced by several countries. Indeed, biorefineries contribute to establish a bioeconomy and accomplish the goals proposed by the 2030 agenda from different perspectives. However, the sustainability concept must be involved in different design stages of biorefineries to guarantee a straightway to an effective change in the world. This statement is based on the few reports addressed to assess the real sustainability of biorefineries involving an integral analysis of economic, social, and environmental aspects. Moreover, a connection between the biorefinery, bioeconomy, and sustainability concepts has not been clearly explained and linked with the SDGs in the open literature. These concepts are discussed independently without any conceptual framework in different literature reports. Thus, this review paper aims to elucidate the existing relation between biorefineries, bioeconomy, and the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of the technical requirements, challenges, and perspectives of biomass upgrading processes. This review paper also includes a discussion about the role of biorefineries in developing a bioeconomy. Moreover, this paper elucidates how the implementation of biorefineries is linked to the SDGs accomplishment. In this way, the objective of this review paper is to provide to the scientific community a vision about the role of biorefineries in the development of a more sustainable production and consumption model and offer an idea to governmental actors and decision-makers on how the biorefineries implementation can contribute to accomplishing the goals proposed by UN.  2 SDGs, Bioeconomy, and biorefineries The SDGs framework is a standardized way to organize thinking about implementing strategies focused on specific issues such as poverty, quality of life, environment, and society (Bautista et al., 2016 ). In this way, the SDGs framework integrates concepts, principles, and criteria to give a structured way to analyze how UN country members contribute to accomplishing the 2030 agenda. Moreover, this framework will result in increased governmental policy coherence in most UN country members. Nevertheless, SDGs have not been included directly in any government action plan since most SDGs are considered macro-goals. In this way, creating a framework for each sector (e.g., education, transport, industry, agriculture) is necessary to transform the SDGs ideas into a series of organized and specific actions (Filho et al., 2021 ). The accomplishment of SDGs requires a series of efforts (changes and innovations) in different sectors, avoiding negative tradeoffs in current governmental development policies. Therefore, only specific actions or policies have been implemented today, but the SDGs' effect can only be seen over time. SDGs can be clustered into three groups (i) Poverty and human well-being, (ii) Sustainable production and consumption, and (iii) Natural resource use (Lucas et al., 2016 ). Those SDGs related to natural resources are considered the base of the SDG organization because these goals are focused on protection, conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of critical natural sources (e.g., water). Therefore, actions addressed to improve natural resource use will provide a better environment. Efforts related to compliance with these SDGs are related to the direct implementation of environmental protection policies at national and international levels. An example of a strategy is the Kyoto Protocol, which reduces greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions. This review paper highlights the need to increase efforts to improve industrial energy efficiency and implement renewable energy systems. On the other hand, sustainable production and consumption SDGs are closer to the bioeconomy and biorefineries concepts. These SDGs can be accomplished by changing the economic model (i.e., fossil fuels transition to renewable resources use). For instance, biomass strength as a source of energy and value-added products can improve responsible consumption and production indicators, encourage innovative technologies, ensure affordable and reliable energy supply, and boost economic growth. Finally, those SDGs related to well-being could be considered the result of other SDGs accomplishment because these SDGs are related to a more sustainable society. All SDGs are affected by a change in the economic model and the primary source for obtaining value-added products and services (i.e., fossil fuels). Consequently, the transition towards a bio-based economy can help to achieve all SDGs faster. Thus, the bioeconomy can be considered as a way to accomplish SDGs. The bioeconomy concept is based on the need to overcome the damage caused by non-renewable resources. This concept can also be related to accomplishing the SDGs since a transition towards a bioeconomy decreases the use of non-renewable resources (Qin et al., 2021 ). Nevertheless, this concept has been interpreted in different ways by different organizations, institutes, and researchers. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the bioeconomy is based on producing renewable biological resources and converting these resources and waste streams into value-added products, such as food, feed, bio-based products, and bioenergy. The European Commission also gives this definition. The German government defines the bioeconomy as “a sustainable bio-based economy-oriented on the natural life-cycle of materials which can provide us with high-quality products from natural resources and sufficient healthy food to satisfy the global demand.” The “National Bioeconomy Blueprint” gives another concept of bioeconomy. “A bioeconomy is based on research and innovation in the biological sciences to create economic activity and public benefit. The US bioeconomy is all around us: new drugs and diagnostics for improved human health, higher-yielding food crops, emerging biofuels to reduce dependency on oil, and biobased chemical intermediates, to name just a few”. Finally, another bioeconomy concept is given by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This international organization thinks bioeconomy “as a world where biotechnology contributes to a significant share of the economic input.” Nevertheless, different authors have criticized the non-existing relationship between the bioeconomy concept and the sustainability concept. The current bioeconomy concept is not emphatic in improving bio-based processes (i.e., biorefineries) (Heimann, 2019 ). However, to really develop the bioeconomy concept in any country, region, or project could not be considered automatically to increase sustainability due to using biomass as raw material. Thus, both the sustainability and bioeconomy concepts should be integrated with the purpose of understating what is really reached when many bioproducts are obtained from biomass instead of non-renewable resources. This integration has been explored in the open literature (Urmetzer et al., 2018 ). The sustainable bioeconomy concept involves including sustainability metrics related to the economic, social, and environmental performance of those activities considered in the bioeconomy framework. The authors highlight the need to differentiate the sustainability and sustainable development concepts because both are similar but imply different states. On the other hand, the bioeconomy concept must be differentiated from the circular economy concept, which has been implemented in some EU country members. Indeed, the bioeconomy differs from the circular economy concept in three key aspects (Korhonen et al., 2018 ). The first aspect is related to the use of renewable biomass and efficient bioprocesses to achieve sustainable production. The second aspect is associated with the use of enabling and converging technologies, including biotechnology. Finally, the third aspect involves the integration between sectors such as agriculture, health, and industry. This integration gives the bioeconomy concept a cross-cutting nature offering the opportunity to address interconnected societal challenges such as food security, fossil-resource dependence reduction, natural resource scarcity, and climate change while achieving sustainable economic development. Heimann (2019)  published a comprehensive study that addressed how bioeconomy activities can quantitatively affect SDGs. This author identified which SDGs are potentially affected by bioeconomy activities. The results were almost the same as those SDGs in the middle of Fig. 1   proposed by Lucas et al. (2016) . Moreover, Heimann (2019)  raised two questions addressed to assess the effect of implementing a bioeconomy. The first question was addressed to answer if the bioeconomy can contribute to the accomplishment of SDGs. The second question was focused on knowing if the bioeconomy can be regarded as an improvement to reach the SDGs compared to the situation today. The main conclusion of this author was related to the road on which we are going today will leave most of SDGs targets unfulfilled. Furthermore, an unsustainable bioeconomy is not the best solution. Regulations, policies, and investments are needed to ensure sustainability. Nevertheless, this author demonstrated that the bioeconomy could potentially be sustainable if implemented wisely. The present paper highlights the importance of biorefineries as the seed to develop a sustainable bioeconomy. In the same way as the bioeconomy concept, several authors and organizations consider different definitions and perspectives about the biorefinery concept. Moreover, the biorefinery idea change depending on the stakeholders involved (Diep et al., 2012 ). Biorefineries could be seen as facilities where biomass is integrally processed. Thus, a biorefinery can be defined as a facility destined to upgrade biomass in different products such as chemicals, energy vectors, and high value-added compounds. Nevertheless, this resumed description does not include terms related to sustainability, efficient use of raw materials, and multiprocessing. Therefore, a review of different definitions of the biorefinery concept is necessary to know different perspectives. Table 1   summarizes some of the most relevant concepts associated with the biorefinery concept in the last years. The ideas showed in Table 1  exhibit an evolution of the biorefinery concept. The biorefinery definitions also make a differentiation between energy products, bio-energy, and value-added products. Biorefineries are complex systems where biomass is upgraded in bulk, specialty, and fine chemicals. This evolution of the biorefinery concept was given to establish a more restricted definition to avoid generalities, which would generate confusion between different scientific community partners in the long term. Moreover, the complementation of the biorefinery concept seeks to involve important aspects of sustainable design, which implies evaluating the real feasibility of the biorefinery. Indeed, not all biomass upgrading processes are biorefineries. Nevertheless, all biorefineries are biomass-upgrading processes. Hence, the biorefinery concept must include sustainability as an essential part to meet all the requirements to implement a new process today. All the definitions presented in Table 1  are the basis for understanding the purposes of a biorefinery. These purposes are (i) To valorize biomass resources, (ii) To produce competitive, marketable products, (iii) To mitigate the environmental damage caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels, (iv) To encourage a sustainable future through the implementation of non-oil-based processes, and (v) To serve as the starting point to boost a bio-based economy in developing and developed countries. In this way, biorefineries must be proposed and designed, considering the purposes mentioned above to align with the current strategies to decrease the damage caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels. Then, the design strategies of biorefineries must differ from the design strategies of crude-oil refineries since the integration of different disciplines, actors (stakeholders), policies, and purposes must be included. These considerations could increase the difficulty of designing and implementing biorefineries in a real context since too many aspects should be involved. It is important to note that technically speaking, all these aspects finally represent different variables to be considered during the design. The challenge is to analyze which variables can be restricted and which ones can be calculated, taking into account the complex independence between them. Biorefineries must be sustainable by definition because the use of biomass as raw material to produce a portfolio of value-added products requires to be in line with the three most important sustainability pillars (i.e., economic, social, and environmental). For this reason, several methodologies to assess the performance of biorefineries have been proposed (Costa et al., 2019 ). Indeed, the most comprehensive analysis of biorefineries is related to the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) Mahbub et al., 2019 ). This methodology implies a critical analysis of different stages of the productive chain (e.g., agronomic stage, industrial processing, waste disposal, and upgrading). Thus, the LCSA can be seen as a tool to ensure the sustainability of biorefineries. Then, the sustainable implementation of biorefineries contributes to establishing a stronger bioeconomy and gives a more promising way to accomplish SDGs. In this way, the sustainability concept must be applied in each step towards accomplishing the SDGs. Furthermore, other authors have discussed the role of biomass biorefining in the development of a bioeconomy. For instance, Ubando et al. (2020)  describe how biorefineries are integrated into the circular bioeconomy framework through the production of platform products, primary products (e.g., biofuels, biogas, sugars, pyrolysis oil, syngas), and secondary products (e.g., pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic products). Moreover, Cristóbal et al. (2018)  discussed the importance of food waste valorization in the bioeconomy development in Europe since this kind of organic material could be upgraded into a series of value-added products and directly usable energy. In both cases, techno-economic and environmental analysis tools have been used to assess the sustainability of different processes alternatives. In this sense, the most concrete way to promote a bioeconomy is to transform renewable raw materials (i.e., biomass) into processes whose sustainability has been previously evaluated. Although biorefineries can boost the bioeconomy, there are some challenges to overcome before establishing biorefineries as a pillar for future economic development. Some of these challenges are (i) Raw materials supply, (ii) Processing scale, (iii) Economic performance without financial support, (iv) Energy efficiency, (v) Selectivity and yield of processes. Different authors have researched all these challenges in the open literature. For instance, Lo et al. (2021)  published a review of the main aspects of the biomass supply chain involving technical and economic aspects. Regarding the processing scale, several authors have highlighted the importance of considering the scale of the process when designing a biorefinery. Serna-Loaiza et al., 2018  elucidate the concept related to the Minimum Processing Scale for Economic Feasibility (MPSEF) to understand how the scale of the process can influence economic performance. The other challenges have been addressed in several publications since energy efficiency and selectivity problems are associated with traditional problems in process design. At the moment of this review (2021), biorefineries have not been implemented as a pillar of the world's economic development. Moreover, the bioeconomy has not been totally recognized today to reduce fossil fuels consumption and promote regional development by implementing effective governmental policies. Nevertheless, it is expected that this concept will play in the future a key role in many countries to ensure more sustainable development. Then, the challenge is to demonstrate the current potential of the bioeconomy to reduce fossil fuels usage, and then the success of the policies to promote it can be expected. In addition, the renewable resources used as primary energy sources have not been established. All these notations have complicated the accomplishment of SDGs. Finally, the unexpected scenario of a pandemic occurred at the beginning of 2020. This fact greatly affected the socio-economic development of many countries (both developed and developing countries) due to the economic expenditure exerted to address the repercussions of COVID-19. Therefore, policies focused on developing an economy based on natural resources have lost importance in government development plans. From all these situations, there is a strong possibility of not achieving most of the SDGs before 2030. Then, several challenges have been raised to boost again biomass and biorefineries as the seed of a bioeconomy.  3 Bioeconomy development based on biorefineries: challenges and opportunities Biorefineries are highlighted in this review as an alternative to developing the bioeconomy since biomass upgrading is a pillar of the bioeconomy concept. Nevertheless, biorefineries are not unique actors in a bioeconomy. Interlinked interactions between the agricultural, industrial, energy, and transport sectors must be accomplished to guarantee a successful bioeconomy. Thus, a bioeconomy based on biomass transformation should improve several aspects in all the sectors mentioned above. Agriculture is one of the most important pillars to develop a bioeconomy because this sector provides a relevant income to developing countries. Nevertheless, different aspects within this sector could be improved to promote the socio-economic development of producers. These aspects are related to (i) agrochemicals use, (ii) complete valorization of agricultural products out of food standards (i.e., loss of agricultural products), (iii) fair payment to farmers, and (iv) recognition of farmers as important actors in productive chains. Several authors have studied these issues by implementing different methodologies. Indeed, Aristizábal-Marulanda et al., 2021  analyzed the effect of the agronomic stage to produce coffee and coffee cut stems (a residue from the coffee crop). These authors reported a high environmental impact derived from the agronomic stage since many fertilizers are required. Then, Aristizábal-Marulanda et al., 2021  took the first step by showing that the agronomic stage could have a greater environmental impact than a biomass upgrading process (i.e., biorefinery) over time. Indeed, the high use of agrochemicals can affect soil fertility and productivity in the future. Then, innovative practices are required. For instance, arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF) can be used to increase the nutrient absorption capacity of different plants, avoiding the excessive use of fertilizers (Baum et al., 2015 ). Besides, microorganisms such as Trichoderma  sp. can be used as a potential biological control agent since these microorganisms against other species such as Phytophthora  sp., Fusarium sp Pythium  sp. Ferreira and Musumeci, 2021 ).  Another example of decreasing agrochemicals use is biochar as a source of phosphorous (Li et al., 2020 ). All these alternatives to reduce agrochemical use (i.e., fertilizers, fungicides, pesticides, herbicides) contribute to developing more sustainable agriculture. In parallel, other studies have demonstrated a positive response of farmers to change to more sustainable agriculture (Laurett et al., 2021 ). Thus, soil fertility and productivity can be guarantee to future generations and give an strength basis to boost bioeconomy. Another issue related to some agricultural productive chains is the low valorization of agricultural products to avoid food and economic losses. Food losses in the entire productive chain of some agricultural products is 30% (approximately) (Alexander et al., 2017 ). This value of food losses varies from one productive chain to another (e.g., food losses are different in the coffee, orange, avocado, and plantain productive chains). Factors such as plant diseases and market specifications contribute to food losses. Johnson et al. (2018)  estimated a share of inedible, edible but unmarketable, and marketable agricultural products in 34.18%, 41.45%, and 24.37%, respectively. Thus, more than 60% of agricultural products could have a commercialization problem since most applications are addressed to food industries. Then, another option to decrease food losses is to create new business for these products. Indeed, the sustainability of food waste conversion into a series of value-added products was discussed by Caldeira et al. (2020)  For instance, Alonso-Gómez et al. (2020)  proposed to produce plantain flour and bioethanol using unmarketable unripe plantains as raw material. These agricultural food losses imply economic losses for farmers. Thus, new upgrading alternatives can improve this situation and encourage economic activities within the bioeconomy framework (e.g., avocado oil production using unmarketable products). Moreover, the basis to boost the bioeconomy needs several improvements because farmers are not seen as the base of a productive system. Farmers are victims of fair salaries since most shareholders do not give a good economic remuneration for agricultural products in developing countries, hindering the opportunity to implement bioeconomy strategies. For instance, creole avocado is paid to farmers at 0.08 USD/avocado in some regions of Colombia, while the same product is sold to consumers at 0.52 USD/avocado. These costs imply an extra cost for avocado higher than 600%. From this extra cost, most incomes are earned by shareholders such as small and medium distributors. Thus, farmers need to be recognized as one of the most important stakeholders to develop a bioeconomy. In the same way, agricultural residues should be upgraded into a series of value-added products applying the biorefinery concept since the composition of most residues can be converted either in energy vectors, sugars, or chemical molecules. For instance, oil palm fronds can produce several components or energy vectors (Cardona Alzate et al., 2018 ). Thus, an example of how biomass upgrading processes can be introduced in the productive chain is presented in Fig. 1 .  Regarding the industrial sector, agricultural products are transformed into food products by implementing several processes. Consequently, large amounts of residues are produced since pulps from fruits are desired in most cases (Beltrán-Ramírez et al., 2019 ). Thus, large amounts of seeds, peels, leaves, exhausted pulps, and stems are produced. For instance, guacamole production only uses the pulp of Hass avocado. Then, seeds and peels are wasted in the process (Perea-Moreno et al., 2016 ). Besides, orange juice production implies orange peel waste production (i.e., about 50% of the orange is wasted as orange peel waste) (Ortiz-Sanchez et al., 2020 ). All these residues (so-called agroindustrial residues) are commonly sent to landfills because this option is the most economical way to dispose of residues (Permal et al., 2020 ). Nevertheless, different authors have proven the negative environmental impact caused by landfills attributed to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), air pollutants, and leachates (Ortiz et al., 2020 ). Thus, the agroindustrial waste disposal in landfills has been criticized and questioned since these residues have a great potential to be upgraded into a series of value-added products. Indeed, several valorization alternatives have been reported in the open literature. In addition, empirical research has been performed to find a portfolio of products. For instance, Spence et al. (2019)  reported biogas production using several agroindustrial residues, and Agama-Acevedo et al. (2016)  assessed the plantain flour production using unripe plantain peel as raw material. Then, the biorefinery concept also can be applied in this sector to upgrade biomass and increases the economic and environmental performance of processes through the development of brownfield projects (Watanabe et al., 2020 ). The energy and transport sectors are also involved in the bioeconomy framework because energy and fuel consumption are essential to developing any economic model. Thus, the production of reliable and affordable renewable energy and energy vectors is crucial (Blazev, 2015 ). For these reasons, creating and promoting policies aimed at protecting biofuels and renewable energy is a fundamental pillar for developing the bioeconomy. Thus, governmental incentives must guarantee energy production using sunlight, hydropower, wind, and biomass as energy sources. Today, there are examples related to the implementation of biomass as an energy source. Indeed, co-gasification facilities are addressed to produce electricity and chemicals by combining fossil fuels (i.e., char) and biomass (i.e., woody biomass) are grown over time Global Syngas Technologies Council, 2019 . Besides, woody biomass has been promoted in EU country members (e.g., Austria) as an energy source by producing wood pellets (Solarte-Toro et al., 2021a ). Biorefineries are interlinked in all productive sectors related to biomass because biomass upgrading is essential to promote more sustainable production. These facilities should not be understood only as complex processes where excessive capital investments are required at the level of many petrochemical industries. Moreover, biorefineries are not only large facilities where biomass components are converted into a series of value-added products. Indeed, biorefineries can be designed at large, middle, and low scales. Indeed, conditions related to the composition of the raw materials, availability, and transport are influential when designing a biorefinery. Then, biorefineries can be classified according to the scale as small-scale and large-scale biorefineries. The scale and supply chain concepts are essential to promote contextualized economic growth. Biorefineries can be designed according to the context in small and large-scale biorefineries. Indeed, some authors have highlighted the role of small-scale biorefineries on developing regions and local economies. Small-scale biorefineries are processing facilities where biomass is upgraded through simple and less expensive process technologies to impact different markets with multiple products (Visser and Van Ree, 2016 ). The advantages of small-scale processing are related to the high potential to alleviate costs associated with transportation, processing, and disposal of side-streams. Then, a significant reduction of the raw materials costs can be observed due to the reduction of intermediaries in the productive chain (Kolfschoten et al., 2014 ). Other advantages related to small-scale biorefineries are creating new job opportunities in rural zones, boost the use of residual biomass, and encouraging farmers to increase crop yield (Bruins and Sanders, 2012 ), contributing increase the importance of farmers in a bioeconomy scenario. Therefore, these systems can be profiled as a sustainable option to be introduced in developed and developing countries to overcome socio-economic and environmental issues. Several studies have been reported in the open literature related to the design and analysis of small-scale biorefineries. For instance, Kolfschoten et al. (2014)  studied the production of beet pulp, biogas, ethanol, and sugar. Visser and Van Ree (2016)  proposed specific design rules for small-scale biorefineries based on previous experiences. The aspects of designing these facilities are (i) reducing capital expenditures (CapEx), (ii) using local residues bioenergy sources, (iii) producing local-market products (e.g., food products), (iv) and using modular and versatile processing units. These rules were proposed to increase the economic performance of small-scale biorefineries since the economy of scale concept does not favor these facilities. In consequence, small-scale biorefineries should be addressed to produce food & feed products and bioenergy. Biorefineries as the base of the bioeconomy must be focused on different research areas. This statement was identified because most studies found in the open literature are related to biomass upgrading are addressed to convert C5  and C6  sugars (Moncada et al., 2018 ). However, other platforms or products should be studied in biorefineries, such as (i) biocompounds (antioxidants and phenolic compounds), (ii) proteins, and (iii) lignin. These products can be considered new challenges for biorefinery designers because these processes require the implementation of other technologies. Even so, these products have also been studied at a laboratory scale. Phenols and antioxidants are found in a wide variety of biomass. Phenols have properties such as antioxidants, antimicrobials, photoreceptions, which lead to the elimination of free radicals, modulation of enzyme activity, and the inhibition of cell proliferation (Karabin et al., 2014 ). The biotransformation of phenols is carried out by methylation and demethylation to increase antioxidant power (Antonczak et al., 2009 ). Then, phenols can be considered a new platform to carry out biotransformation processes to obtain higher value-added products. On the other hand, nitrogenous compounds (i.e., proteins and peptides) have received special attention because valuable ingredients for food and feed applications can be obtained. The separation of proteins and peptides should be done before other processes because these compounds are susceptible to pH and temperature changes. Furthermore, the extraction of proteins and peptides can improve the economic performance of the biorefinery because these compounds have a high value in the market. Proteins are considered potential sources of free amino acids, precursors of high-priced chemicals in the food industry. Moreover, proteins and peptides obtained from biomass can also be applied in the synthesis of bio-based films. Although the possible economic advantages of the commercialization of proteins and peptides are still under research. (Dragone et al., 2020 ). Finally, lignin can produce a wide variety of products such as ferulic and vanillin acids, ethylene, acetylene, phenols, biomaterials, and phenolic acids (Poveda-Giraldo et al., 2021 ).  4 Metrics for SDGs tracking linked to biorefineries SDGs are composed of a series of specific targets. For instance, SDG1 is composed of five targets (i.e., eradicate extreme poverty, reduce at least by half the proportion of people living in poverty, implement nationally social protection systems, ensure equal rights to economic resources, and build the resilience of the poor). Indeed, exists 232 indicators designed to track the accomplishment of the 2030 Agenda. The estimation of these indicators is done using the information given by Our World in Data database. Besides, one target can have more than one indicator. Therefore, an analysis of all SDGs indicators is possible to find some aspects needed to be improved. For instance, Dang and Serajuddin (2020)  reported some challenges to consider when analyzing SDGs indicators. The first challenge is to avoid overlapping indicators. For example, SDG1-Target 1.5 overlaps with SDG11-Target 11.5, SDG4-Target 4.7 overlaps with SDG12-Target 12.8, and SDG11-Target 11.7 overlaps with SDG16-Target 16.1. The second challenge is associated with potentially conflicting goals. Economic growth using fossil fuels will affect the environmental indicators. A response to avoid re-thinking indicators is addressed to change the economic model. Indeed, the implementation of biorefineries can solve this conflict since biomass conversion allows increasing economic growth without sacrifice environmental performance. Thus, biorefineries and bioeconomy can help to accomplish directly or indirectly SDGs. Then, Table 2   presents a comprehensive summary of how biorefineries can contribute to accomplishing SDGs. SDGs are measured by estimating a series of indicators, as can be seen in Table 2 .  Moss indicators are estimated by country. Some indicators are directly related to biorefineries since most SDGs are addressed to clean production, sustainable development, sustainable agriculture, affordable energy, entrepreneurship alternatives, and responsible production and consumption. In this way, biorefineries play a key role in boosting the SDGs accomplishment because renewable resources (i.e., biomass) can be set as the new pillar for human development. Nevertheless, technical challenges related to increasing the portfolio of products, energy efficiency, water consumption, and mass integration (e.g., process intensification) have been identified. Then, several authors have analyzed all these aspects.  5 Sustainability assessment of biorefineries: A comprehensive evaluation of biomass conversion Sustainability has been defined as the perfect balance between economic, environmental, and social aspects. Moreover, a biorefinery has been defined as the base of a bioeconomy world. In this way, there is necessary to perform an integrated analysis of a biorefinery through a sustainability framework to ensure a “good” or “appropriated” conceptual design, which can be used as a starting point to the next stages (e.g., detailed design, procurement, construction). Thus, an integrated analysis of each of the three pillars of sustainability is essential because good economic performance is not a synonym of sustainability (IChemE, 2002; Prasara-A and Gheewala, 2016 ). Moreover, there is necessary to understand how to increase overall sustainability by improving or modifying economic, environmental, and social aspects. Even, there is necessary to understand the context because different situations related to politics and culture can affect the design of the biorefinery and the scope of the process (Bautista et al., 2016 ). In this way, the implementation of an integrated analysis using all the life cycle assessment guidelines given by international organizations (e.g., UNEP) and the information given by several indicators can quantify the performance of a biorefinery (Ciroth et al., 2011 ). Thus, an integrated analysis refers to perform an analysis of the biorefinery system contemplating the effect of one dimension on the other (Bautista et al., 2016 ). Therefore, there is necessary to consider the analysis of a biorefinery system as a network where the result of each indicator can affect the other one. This integral evaluation can be done through the LCSA. An LCSA evaluates all environmental, social, and economic negative impacts and benefits in decision–making processes towards more sustainable products thought-out their life cycle (Ciroth et al., 2011 ). The LCSA summarizes information related to different aspects, which can be used as a tool for decision-making. One of the most important advantages of the LCSA is covering the whole life cycle of products analyzed from different perspectives, which allows understating the true effect of the product in all stages of a productive chain. In other words, those analyses combining the life cycle thinking methodology and the three dimensions of sustainability are known as life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA). In this way, the evaluation of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions is done by applying the life cycle costing (LCC), environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA), and social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) approaches (Solarte-toro and Cardona Alzate, 2021b ). The main user of the results of LCSA are potential and future decision-makers, stakeholders, enterprises, and consumers The LCSA has different advantages and difficulties. The main difficulty of performing the LCSA is to provide all the required information to perform LCC, E-LCA, and S-LCA. Different software companies give a well-structured database, but access to this information is difficult. In this way, an LCSA should be performed using different databases such as Ecoinvent and PSILCA for environmental and social analysis. Moreover, information from the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) firms for cost estimating. Other information sources can be used to perform the life cycle inventory of each dimension. However, the quality of the analysis will be reduced in the same way that the information used. For this reason, the validation of the information and the qualification of the data acquired must be reported. The advantages of an LCSA are (i) complex environmental, economic and social information and data of a productive process (e.g., biorefinery) are given in a structured form, which a comprehensive understanding of the productive chain, (ii) this analysis allows clarifying the tradeoffs between the three sustainability dimensions, life cycle stages, and impacts, products, and generations by providing a more comprehensive overview of positive and negative impacts along the product life cycle, (iii) decision-makers can use the information to prioritize resources, (iv) more sustainable technologies and products can be selected based on the information given by the life cycle inventory and life cycle results, and (v) This analysis provides guiding principles to achieve sustainable consumption and production (SCP). Most analyses have only been focused on the process (i.e., a gate-to-gate analysis) or only have included the E-LCA. In this case, the authors make a difference between an LCSA and a multidimensional sustainability assessment (MSA) since the economic and social dimensions are not evaluated following the life cycle thinking approach in most cases. In this way, A multidimensional sustainability assessment (MSA) can be defined to assess the sustainability of a process with or without ISO guidelines. A multidimensional sustainability assessment involves the three pillars of sustainability. Nevertheless, the analysis of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions is not performed following the life cycle guidelines and ISO standards. This statement is the main difference between LCSA and MSA. In addition, another difference is related to the number of dimensions involved in the analysis. Indeed, LCSA involves the three dimensions of sustainability, while MSA can involve the three dimensions or at least two (the so-called 3D or 2D analysis). MSA performs an overall assessment of sustainability by using a set of indicators and other approaches. Besides, MSA seeks to give a comprehensive understanding of the process. Thus, the authors further classify the analysis due to the type of approach employed to assess the sustainability of a biorefinery system. From an epistemological perspective, an LCSA also is defined as an approach to perform an MSA (see Fig. 2  ). Nevertheless, this differentiation is not well elucidated in the open literature because “sustainability” has been seen as the top for process evaluation. The advantages of the MSA are similar to the advantages of an LCSA. Therefore, an MSA analysis can give valuable information related to the overall behavior of the process considering several externalities. Moreover, the MSA can be done considering only two dimensions of sustainability. For instance, Posada et al. (2013)  reported a preliminary sustainability assessment of different pathways to upgrade bioethanol in a biorefinery. These authors involve economic, environmental, and risk dimensions, which were evaluated using a set of indicators. However, this type of analysis can be considered an MSA because only two dimensions are involved, and there is no influence of the ISO standards. Aristizábal-Marulanda et al. (2020)  report the economic and social assessment of a coffee-cut stems-based biorefinery. These authors report an economic assessment using the NPV and PBP indicators as metrics to estimate the performance of the process. In contrast, a social impact assessment involving the workers and local community stakeholders was considered. This analysis can be classified as an MSA because there is involved two of the three sustainability dimensions. In this way, there is a lot of paper where a multidimensional assessment is reported. 5.1 Study case of sustainability assessment of biorefineries Aristizábal-Marulanda et al. (2020)  reported the economic, environmental, and social assessment of a CCS-based biorefinery. In addition, the authors reported the comparison of two ways to upgrade this raw material. The first option (so-called by the authors as “base case”) considered the production of bioethanol and electricity (see Fig. 3  a ). In this configuration, the bioethanol production is carried out through the following steps (i) particle size reduction, (ii) dilute acid pretreatment and detoxification, (iii) enzymatic hydrolysis, (iv) fermentation using Zymomonas mobilis , and (v) distillation and dehydration. The second option considered the cogeneration process using CCS as fuel to produce electricity and low-pressure steam. This process was composed of a gas turbine and a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) unit. The first configuration was designed considering a total supply of the bioethanol energy requirements from the cogeneration process. The second option only involved the production of electricity (see Fig. 3 b ). Both scenarios were simulated using the Aspen Plus v9.0 software. A processing scale of 4.23 t/h was considered (dry basis). The economic assessment was carried out using the net present value (NPV) and payback period (PBP) as indicators. Moreover, the MPSEF was found (Loaiza et al., 2018 ). The environmental assessment was done applying the E-LCA methodology. Finally, a social impact assessment (SIA) was applied to calculate the social impact of the biorefineries. For this, the PSILCA indicators were used. In addition, the workers and local community stakeholders were considered (Eisfeldt and Ciroth, 2018 ). The total cost of the first biorefinery was 22.9 million USD. Raw materials and utility costs shared 73.6% of the operative costs (21.2% and 52.4%, respectively). The first option had a negative behavior because the NPV did not reach a positive value during the project lifetime (i.e., ten years). Therefore, the economic performance of the biorefinery was poor at the proposed processing scale. For this reason, Aristizábal-Marulanda et al. (2020)  calculated the production costs of bioethanol and steam at different processing scales. From this analysis, higher processing scales decrease production costs. Indeed, the bioethanol production costs decrease from 2.02 USD/L at 4.23 t/h to 0.69 USD/L at 360 t/h. On the other hand, the same economic assessment was performed to determine the economic performance of the cogeneration process using CCS as feedstock. The total costs of the second option were 15.97 USD million. Raw materials and utilities cost-shared 74.7% of the operative costs (6.4% and 68.3%, respectively). In the same way as the base case, the economic performance of the process is negative. The production costs of low-pressure steam, medium pressure steam, high-pressure steam, and electricity also have the same behavior elucidated in the base case. A good economic performance can be obtained at higher processing scales in both cases. Thus, the solution to reach a net profit from the process is to increase the raw material supply. Indeed, a processing scale of 360 t/h gives a good economic performance of the first biorefinery (i.e., bioethanol + heat + power) since a positive profit margin and payback period were obtained (i.e., +0.66% and 5.3 years). Nevertheless, the other dimensions can limit this analysis. For this reason, the importance of performing an integrated analysis is highlighted in this review paper. The amount of raw material demanded by the first option cannot be supplied in Colombian, even if the all-CCS production in Colombia is centralized. This statement is analyzed in a better way in the social impact assessment. The E-LCA results are presented in Table 3  . The most affected impact categories in both processes were CC and WD. The heat and power production process has a higher environmental impact than the “base case” in all the impact categories assessed, with an average share of 52%. This behavior can be attributed to the higher gaseous releases of CO2 , CO, and NOx and water consumption. The FET category has a lower value in heat and power generation due to the final disposition of the wastewater produced in the bioethanol production process. Nevertheless, the base case presented an average share of 48% in all categories assessed. In this way, the CCS upgrading process for bioethanol, heat, and power production is a better option than the no valorization of this agro-industrial waste based on the previously evaluated impact categories. Finally, Aristizábal-Marulanda identified the pretreatment stage as the largest contributor to the impact categories evaluated. Then, a careful design of the pretreatment stage must be done. The social impact assessment (SIA) was done using information from the simulation procedure and labor conditions in the Colombian context. The total number of employees is seven per shift in the first case. Nevertheless, the workforce varies in a week because one free day is given to each employee in a week. Therefore, extra hours must be worked in the facility to accomplish the product requirements. From these considerations, a working time of 56 and 48 h per employee/week were calculated for supervisors and operators, respectively. These results were calculated only considering direct work hours. In this way, supervisors work more hours than operators producing higher salaries for this workers group. This situation implies a marked difference in the quality of life of the staff in the CCS facility. Moreover, marked salary differences generate an increase in the gap between the upper and middle class in Colombia, which has been identified as one of the main social issues in the country. Regarding the local community stakeholder, access to material resources, safe and healthy conditions, and local employment were calculated using the simulation results. The first subcategory was calculated by considering water needs. Then, the water requirements in terms of cooling and process water are used. Indeed, the water needed for the biorefinery is 5.63*108  m3 /year. The water withdrawal of the industrial sector in Colombia is 2.24*109  m3 /year. Then, the first biorefinery requires 25.13% of the industrial water in Colombia. This value, compared to the water needs of other companies such as Ingenio Manuelita (2.6%), Ecopetrol (2.5%), and Esenttia (0.04%), is excessive (Ecopetrol, 2018; Esenttia, 2014; Manuelita, 2014 ). Thus, the proposed CCS-energy-driven biorefinery in the base case is not realistic. The land area required to produce the CCS flow used in the biorefinery is 755 km2 , representing 9.72% of the total area designated for the coffee crop in Colombia. This share is reasonable due to the total area harvested in the Caldas department was 730 km2 . Therefore, the extraction of CCS to supply the energy-driven biorefinery requirements could be feasible from this perspective. The SIA of the cogeneration process gave 3 and 1 employees per shift (operators and supervisor). Therefore, the overall employees in the plant are 12. Thus, the hours of work per employee in a week is 56. Regarding the local community stakeholder, the first analyzed indicator is the water withdrawal. The total water requirements of the process were 1.326*103  m3 /year. These results account for 5.92% of the total industrial water. This value is more realistic in comparison to the results in the base case. Indeed, the share of industrial water consumption is a little greater than the water requirements of real companies in Colombia. Moreover, biomass extraction to supply the raw material needs involves 23.27 km2 , which is a very low value compared to the required area in the base case. From this area needs, only 0.3% of the total coffee area harvested in the country. A global evaluation of tradeoffs is required since conceptually designed processes (involving novel biomass conversion technologies, value-added compounds production, and novel raw materials) must be studied and contextualized before being proposed as alternatives to be implemented in a real context. Indeed, the industry-academia gap must be overcome by designing and implementing contextualized processes using biomass conversion technology with a high technological readiness level. Contextualized biorefineries must be designed considering the following tradeoffs (i) Local vs. Global, (ii) Raw material conversion level, (iii) Environmental benefits and impacts, and (iv) Economic performance. The global vs. local tradeoff can be analyzed from different perspectives. For instance, local biorefineries can be implemented in many cases to upgrade biomass into a series of local marketable products (e.g., extracts, biogas, etc.) without complex imported technologies. Then, the proposed local biorefinery can support the accomplishment of the SDGs since this decision can boost local employment and represent a way to economic activation. Nevertheless, biorefineries designers and decision-makers must be careful because local processes can reduce the opportunity to upgrade a raw material integrally. The local vs. global tradeoff should also consider an economic perspective since local processes at the beginning would not significantly impact macroeconomic indicators of a country (e.g., Gross Domestic Product - GDP). However, it is important to note that finally, a successful policy of local biorefineries implementation will positively impact the macroeconomic indicators of any country. The second tradeoff is related to raw material conversion. While the goal of a biorefinery is to upgrade almost all biomass components into a series of value-added products, this objective should not always be accomplished since economic conditions vary across countries and regions. Then, the products portfolio can decrease substantially as the processing of all the raw material is not profitable. For instance, a biorefinery designed to upgrade cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin fractions into organic acids, food additives, and phenolic compounds highly depend on the scale of available raw material and the final conversion to value-added products. Thus, decision-makers and designers should change the biorefinery scope based on the desired and potential raw material conversion by selecting the most suitable products for commercialization. Then, the raw material conversion is a very complex task, including specific tradeoffs regarding the availability (potential scale and supply chain) and products characteristics (value and diversification of the multiproduct portfolio). The third tradeoff is about environmental performance. Biorefineries are complex processes with side-streams and releases as any other oil-refineries. Thus, an environmental impact is expected. However, the minimization of the environmental impact should not always be a profitable option. Improvements related to the use of more promising technologies, in this case, usually end on the increase of the global environmental impact. Hence, a balance between economic and environmental aspects must be reached, and only optimization methods can help technically solve this tradeoff. Finally, the economic performance tradeoff is a transversal concept resulting from all the tradeoffs mentioned above. Regarding the Colombian context, biorefineries can boost the implementation of a bioeconomy and help to accomplish the SDGs by considering specific points such as (i) Agro-industrial residues valorization (reducing the environmental problems related to the disposal of millions of tons of these residues every year), (ii) Creation of entrepreneurship initiatives (i.e., small-scale processes) based on agricultural residues upgrading, (iii) Increase of renewable energy production by implementing decentralized energy-producing technologies (e.g., anaerobic digestion and gasification for diversifying the energy matrix of the country and covering rural regions non-connected to the grid), (iv) Improvement of current biomass processing facilities (sugarcane mills, palm oil mills, rice mills, etc.) to produce more value-added marketable products instead of energy by combustion. All these suggestions can improve the opportunity of starting the implementation of biorefineries in a real context. Most of these proposals can be developed with governmental support and existing Colombian policies to develop biotechnology, bio-energy, bioeconomy, and biomass industrialization in the country. However, the real development of the biorefineries in Colombia based on the above-discussed topics represents a very important challenge for designers. Currently, Colombia is exiting slowly from a conflict time involving all the possible economic, environmental, and social problems. Then, the accurate consideration of all the tradeoffs regarding the biorefineries design and analysis is imperative to ensure the sustainability of the rural zones development in the country   6 Conclusions Biorefineries research, study, and implementation must be prioritized in all UN country members since these facilities are the base to build a strong bioeconomy framework. Then, biorefineries and sustainable production, and biomass sources can be profiled as promising options for most SDGs. Nevertheless, technical aspects related to technology improvements and supply chain must be overcome to connect biorefineries with other productive stages (e.g., agriculture, transport, energy production). Finally, biorefineries can boost SDGs targets compliance, but current socio-economic and environmental issues are a strong impediment to accomplish the 2030 agenda.
