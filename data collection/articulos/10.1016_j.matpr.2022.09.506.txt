                  In recent times, the application of engineered nanoparticles has increased in the agricultural sector due to their use as nano-pesticides, nano-fertilizer, nano-sensors etc. A field trial of Nano fertilizer in Pusa Basmati 1509 was laid down in the present study to promote sustainable agriculture in rice production to reduce the consumption of urea in the region. Magnetite (Fe3O4) was used as a nanofertilizer for the present study, synthesized using co-precipitation technique and characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to confirm the phase and purity of the material. Influence of Magnetite was observed on yield and quality attributes of Pusa Basmati 1509 in comparison to control as well as various sources of nitrogen. Nanofertilizer in combination with a reduced quantity of urea was beneficial for the yield enhancement (15.64 Qtls/Acre) and quality (64.9 % Brown Head Rice) improvement of Pusa Basmati 1509. The use of nanofertilizer in isolation resulted in higher yield (13.72 Qtls/Acre) compared to control (9.2 Qtls/Acre). The application of Farmyard manure and poultry manure too resulted in higher farm yield (12.3Qtls/Acre and 11.76 Qtls/Acre respectively) in comparison to control (9.2 Qtls/Acre). This showed that the combination of urea and nanofertilizer had a synergistic effect.Thus, use of nanofertilizer reduced urea consumption in Pusa Basmati 1509, enhancing its yield and improving brown head rice recovery.

This field has gained popularity due to its applications in nanosensors [2] , nanomedicines [3] , wastewater treatment [4] , and nanofertilizers [5] . Day by day increasing pollution and deterioration of soil has resulted in decreasing the yield output and ultimately affecting the national economy [6] . Therefore, to improve the productivity efficiency, nanofertilizers are being used on a commercial scale [7] . The use of nanofertilizers helps to overcome the water and soil pollution problems and lower the carbon emissions in comparison to the conventional fertilizers that affect the climate severely [8] . Nanofertilizers provide a flow of nutrients to the crop and hence affect the quality and yield. India is a country with a variety of crops and Basmati Rice is nature’s exclusive gift to this subcontinent. In comparison to other varieties of scented rice, Basmati is distinguished by its distinctive and delicately balanced combination of favored characteristics that distinguishes it from the rest (such as superfine kernels, exquisite aroma, sweet taste, soft texture, delicate curvature and linear kernel elongation with least breadth wise swelling on cooking) [9] . PB 1509 (IET 21960) is an early maturing Basmati Rice variety with seed to seed maturity of around 120 days and average yield of 15.7 Qtls/acre. It has been reported to produce an average yield of 5.6% over PUSA BASMATI1121 in the Basmati growing regions of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and U.P. [10] . PB 1509 is known to facilitate less use of water (about 33% saving of irrigation water). PB1509 offers various advantages over other Basmati Rice varieties in INDIA, including non-shattering at maturity and non-lodging behavior due to its semi-dwarf height stem (95–100 cm) and early maturity. This cultivar yields about half the biomass of PB 1121 and hence may help reduce environmental pollution caused by rice straw burning. PB 1509 has extra slender grains (8.41 mm) with very occasional grain chalkiness and very good kernel length after cooking (19.1 mm). PB 1509 is quite popular in Punjab state as it fetches higher prices in the grain market. In the year 2018 it could attract prices as high as Rs 3000–3200 per Qtl. In the year 2018 it was grown in 41,100 Hectares [11]  considering the area under cultivation of PB 1509 it is evident that PB 1509 is Punjab farmer’s next choice to PB 1121 amongst the Basmati Rice [12] . Hence, it can be illustrated that PB 1509 consumes a substantial amount of Nitrogenous fertilizer in the form of Di Ammonium Phosphate and Urea. Singh et al. studied rice growth with nano Phosphorus fertilizer [13]  while Yuvraj et al. tested Nano Zinc fertilizer on Rice in 2014 [14] .However, the extensive use of urea for fertilizer management in order to enhance production per unit area while neglecting natural resources and ecosystems has been a popular technique in recent years. One of these problems is that urea has adverse effects on seed germination, seedling growth, and early plant growth in soil. During the nitrification process, the amount of free hydrogen ions (H+ ) in the soil rises, resulting in acidity. Additionally, as plants take up ammonium ions (NH4+ ), they also release hydrogen ions into the soil. A typical contaminant in urea fertilizers is biuret (C2 H5 N3 O2 ), which may be broken-down in soil but does so over a lengthy period of time, and is phytotoxic throughout the process. Moreover, too much urea and by extension too much nitrogen may have a deleterious influence on plants. It may also have a severe influence on nearby environments: nitrate is particularly mobile in water, and leaching from agriculture is damaging to rivers. Therefore, Researchers have started working on Nanofertilizer to a level where major fertilizer companies have started multi-locational on field trials of Nanofertilizer and launched it at commercial scale in the domestic market to reduce the use of urea [15] . It is an indicator that Nanofertilizers have a great future ahead in promoting sustainable agriculture. In order to reduce the consumption of nitrogenous fertilizer in production of PB 1509, a systematic field trial was conducted in the present study. Various treatments (Treatment 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) were compared with respect to their impact on plant growth, yield as well as physical parameters of grain quality of PB 1509. Out of all the treatments, Nanofertilizer was a new product tested during PB 1509 production.  2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and reagents Ferric Chloride (FeCl3 ) and Ferrous Sulphate (FeSO4 ), procured from Alpha Aesar company with 99.99% purity were used as the sources for iron. Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) was used as a pH regulator. The chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without any further purification. Double Distilled Water (DDW) was used as a solvent throughout the work.  2.2 Synthesis of Fe3 O4  nanofertilizer Fe3 O4  (Magnetite) nanofertilizer was prepared by using co-precipitation technique. In typical synthesis, 100 ml of 0.4 mol/L solution of FeCl3  and 100 ml of 0.2 mol/L solution of FeSO4  were mixed and dissolved in distilled water with vigorous stirring to ensure homogeneity. 2 mol/L NaOH solution was further added to maintain the pH between 10 and 11and kept on stirring for 1 h forming dark coloured precipitates. The produced precipitates were then filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper and then washed several times using distilled water and acetone as shown in Fig. 1  . The filtered material was then dried overnight at 80 °C and the obtained nanostructures are shown in Fig. 2  . The dried powder was then ground and stored for further use. The chemical reaction of Fe3 O4  formation may be written as:(1) Fe2+  + 2Fe3+  + 8OH−  → Fe3 O4  + 4H2 O      3 Materials and methods 3.1 Seed treatment Certified grade seed of PB 1509 was used for raising nursery. For seed treatment, a fungicide solution was prepared by dissolving 10 gm Carbendazim in 10L of water. 20 Kg seed was soaked in 25L of fungicide solution for 24 hrs. After 24 hrs, excess water was drained off and seed was soaked on the floor in a thin layer and a cover under shade for sprouting. Water was sprinkled 2–3 times a day to avoid heating up and drying of soaked seeds. Seeds were kept moist and covered up to 38–42 hrs for sprouting [16] .  3.2 Nursery sowing Wet seedbed of 100-sq m area was prepared after puddling for raising the nursery. Nursery was sown on 25th May 2019 for reducing blast disease. 4 Kg of sprouted seed was broadcasted in the evening in a wet seedbed with 5 cm fresh standing water. Seedling raised in 1000 sq m sown with 20 Kg of good quality treated seeds is enough to transplant 1 ha of land. Excess water was drained off on the second day and the nursery was irrigated with freshwater the next day. Fertilizer was added at the time of field preparation during last puddling @ 50 Kg urea, 125 Kg Superphosphate and 25 Kg Zinc Sulphate/ha. 50 Kg urea/ha was applied after 15 days after weeding. 30 days old seedlings at 5–6 leaf stage were used for transplanting. Nursery bed was irrigated a day before uprooting the seedlings. Seedlings were uprooted one by one and roots were gently washed to remove mud. The seedlings were tied in the bundles of 100–150 each.  3.3 Transplanting Transplanting of seedlings was done on 25th June 2019 and transplanted in rows with 1–2 seedlings/hill at a row-to-row and plant-to-plant distance of 20 cm × 15 cm (33 Plants/ sq m) with 2–3 cm depth.  3.4 Weed control Pendimethalin 30 EC@1000 ml/acre was mixed in 10 Kg sand and applied in the field after 3–4 days of transplanting. The depth of the water in the field was maintained at 4–5 cm for 2–3 days after use of weedicide.  3.5 Fertilizer application Zinc Sulphate @ 10 Kg/acre was applied as a basal dose at puddling. Phosphorus application was skipped because the recommended dose had been applied to the preceding wheat crop [17] . Following 6 treatments were established in plot size of 5 m × 5 m with 5 replicates each.• Control: i.e. without any nitrogen.  • Farmyard Manure: @6 Tons/acre before preparatory tillage.  • Urea @ 54 Kg/acre in 2 splits i.e.; 21 days after transplanting (DAT) and 42 DAT.  • Poultry Manure @2.5 Tons/acre before preparatory tillage.  • Urea @ 20 Kg/acre and Nano Fertilizer @ 20 Kg/acre in 2 splits at 21 DAT and 42 DAT.  • Nano Fertilizer @20 Kg/acre in 2 splits at 21 DAT and 42 DAT.     3.6 Irrigation and drainage Standing water was maintained in the paddy field up to 2–3 weeks after transplanting. After this period the field was irrigated only after absorption of water.  3.7 Insect control Chlorpyriphos @1000 ml/acre was applied to control Leaf Folder July to October. In case of yellow stem borer Economic ThreshHold, Level was 5% dead hearts or 1 egg mass/sq m or 1 month/sq m crop. To control it after transplanting 1 Ltr20 EC Chlorpyrifos was applied to the crop.  3.8 Disease control To control leaf blast just on the appearance of brown specks on leaves, the crop was sprayed with Carbendazim @200 gm/acre. To control neck blast once again Carbendazim @ 200 gm/acre was sprayed at 50% flowering stage.  3.9 Harvesting and threshing The Basmati crop was harvested at maturity when all grains had turned golden yellow except 2–3 grains of light greenish shade. To withdraw paddy samples, crops were harvested. Crop was threshed manually, and samples collected and weighed separately. The same paddy samples were analyzed in the Quality Control Laboratory for selected parameters [16] .  3.10 Panicle collection and observation Ten panicles were collected from all the plots. Various data were recorded in standing mature crops. Observations regarding the panicles were made after crop harvest.  3.11 Quality testing Quality Test was carried out on Rice Grain by following the strategy already tested and published [18,16] . Moisture (Before drying):   Paddy moisture was measured using Satake’s Digital Moisture Meter. De Husking:   It was carried out using Satake’s Husker. Grading:   Paddy and Brown Head Rice were separated from broken using Satake’s Grader. Two samples of 20 gm each from brown rice were withdrawn for manual analysis of chalky, green, immature, damaged and discolored and 1000 grain weight. Such 5 replicates were analyzed. Average value of 5 replicates has been reported in final tables. Bulk Density:   Bulk density equipment was placed on a plain surface. The Screws of the equipment were adjusted. Hopper was filled with clean paddy. Lock was placed and a litter cup was filled and placed below the hopper. Paddy was cut with a wooden scale at the top of the cup after emptying the hopper. Thereafter, paddy was weighed,and bulk density was calculated by dividing the weight of paddy by volume of cup. Nanoscience is the modification of atoms or molecules to synthesize new products measuring a maximum of 100 nm [1] . This field has gained popularity due to its applications in nano sensors [2] , nanomedicines [3] , wastewater treatment [4] , and nanofertilizers [5] . Day to day increase in pollution and deterioration of soil has resulted in decreasing the yield output and ultimately affecting the national economy [6] . Therefore, to improve the productivity efficiency, nanofertilizers are being used on a commercial scale [7] . The use of nanofertilizers helps to overcome the water and soil pollution problems and lower the carbon emissions in comparison to the conventional fertilizers that affect the climate severely [8] . Nanofertilizers provide a flow of nutrients to the crop and hence affect the quality and yield. India is a country with a variety of crops and Basmati Rice is nature’s exclusive gift to this subcontinent. The supremacy of Basmati over other varieties of scented rice is attributed to its unique and delicately balanced combination of favored characters (such as superfine kernels, exquisite aroma, sweet taste, soft texture, delicate curvature and linear kernel elongation with least breadth wise swelling on cooking) [9] . As a result of these properties, Basmati rice commands a premium price in the world market, and much of the crop is sold for export. Of the various evolved Basmati rice varieties PUSA BASMATI 1509 (PB 1509) is the one, which was released in the year 2013.   4 Results and discussion 4.1 Structural analysis Phase formation, purity and structural properties of the prepared nanofertilizer (Fe3 O4 ) were investigated from the XRD pattern as shown in Fig. 3  . It is observed that nanofertilizer consists of two phases which are α-Fe2 O3  and Fe3 O4  as confirmed by matching with standard JCPDS card #89-0599 and #82-1533 respectively [19] . Peaks present at 30.39, 35.69, 43.14, 53.57,57.30, 62.94 and 74.36° are attributed to the (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) crystallographic planes of face centered cubic Fe3 O4  system having space group Fd3m.The average size of Fe3 O4  and α-Fe2 O3  crystallites in nanofertlizer are found to be 23.72 and 38.28 nm respectively as calculated using Scherrer equation.  4.2 Statistical analysis Experiment was conducted following Randomized Block Design consisting of 5 replicates of 6 treatments each. The yield as well as quality data in 5 replicates each were subjected to Coefficient of Variation [20] . The mean values with Coefficient of Variation are presented in Table 1  . Fig. 4   represents the effect of nitrogen sources on mean yield of PB 1509. The effect of various nitrogen sources on the coefficient of variation of yield of PB 1509 is depicted in Fig. 5  . The major research and application of Nanotechnologies on crops are in Rice and Wheat [21–24] . Effect of integrated use of nano and non-nano fertilizers on yield and yield attributes of wheat have been carried out only recently [25] . Response of yield and yield components in wheat to soil application of Nano Potassium fertilizer was studied earlier [26] . Relatively very few studies have been conducted to test the efficiency of nano fertilizer in Basmati Rice. Even these studies are limited to the influence of nanofertilizer on yield and yield components only. Impact of Nano fertilizer on the quality parameters of Basmati rice could not be cited by the authors. Thus, the present study consists of the impact of nanofertilizer in comparison to other nutrient sources on yield as well as quality attributes of commercial significance of PB 1509 will fall into a special category. Indiscriminate use of urea for nutrient management to get maximum production per unit area without caring about natural resources and ecosystems is becoming a common practice these days. Considering this fact, a field trial was laid down to compare the efficacy of selected treatments as mentioned in the methodology. Yield varied between 9.2 Qtls/acre (Control) to 15.64 Qtls/acre (Nano Fertilizer + Urea). Use of Nano Fertilizer alone resulted in the yield of 13.72 Qtls/acre which was lower than the use of urea alone. It indicates that nano fertilizer in combination with urea is the best possible way to achieve maximum yield in PB 1509. Farmyard Manure and Poultry Manure gave higher yield than control but lower than urea and nano fertilizer. The use of urea was must to attain higher yield. Although farmyard manure and poultry manure delivered lower yield than the urea alone, nano fertilizer alone and nano fertilizer with urea but their usage gave much higher yield as compared to control. The market price of rice is determined by head rice recovery, which is a milling quality attribute which is highly influential. Head Rice Recovery is the proportion of paddy rice that retains 75% of its length after milling [27] . High head rice yield is one of the most important prerequisites for determining milled rice quality. Broken grain normally fetches only half of the value of head rice to the owner. The head rice percentage in milled rice depends on varietal characteristics, production factors, harvesting, drying and milling process. Since, in the present study variety, harvesting, drying as well as milling process are all the same, it is the production factor which plays a crucial role over here. Amongst the production factors the variant was only nutrient management. Brown head rice percentage varied between 60.7% (Control) to 65.5% (Nano Fertilizer alone). Nano fertilizer with or without urea had a positive impact on brown head rice percentage. Farmyard manure and poultry manure too improved brown head rice percentage but not as high as nano fertilizer. Use of urea resulted in a maximum brown broken percentage i.e. 16.6%. minimum brown broken percentage i.e.; 13.2% was observed in case of Nano Fertilizer alone. Paddy moisture percentage varied between 16.9% and 18.3%. Considering the narrow range of variation in moisture percentage it is for sure that whatever variation in brown head rice percentage and brown broken percentage is there it is due to the nutrient management. Amongst the various sources of nutrients nano fertilizer has been most beneficial in improving brown head rice percentage in PB 1509. The values of coefficient of variation in the yield varied between 0.5and0.9. Whereas,the coefficient of variation (CV) in the quality attributes varied between 0.4 and 0.9. These figures were observed to be low as distributions with CV < 1 are considered as low variance. Lesser value of coefficient of variation indicates more consistency amongst the replicates. CV is a statistical term that refers to the dispersion of data points in a data series relative to the mean. Nano Fertilizer was able to reduce the amount of fertilizer to the extent of 60% and had an obvious yield-increasing effect in PB 1509. This is in accordance with Shiwen Huang et al reported 30–40% yield enhancement in Hybrid Rice varieties [28] . Nano fertilizer is known to increase the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilization in earlier studies too. Slow-release fertilizers are a great alternative to urea since they release nutrients more slowly during the crop's development. Plants can receive the majority of nutrients from delayed release fertilizers without releasing their waste. Thus, nanofertilizers are being developed for their gradual release and effective nutrient uptake by plants [29] . Nano Fertilizers increase crop growth and yield when administered at the recommended levels. Additionally, if the concentration of nanofertilizers is greater than the optimal, they have an inhibiting influence on crop development. Increased doses of nanofertilizers also inhibited crop growth and yield [29] . The use of Nano fertilizer will not only reduce urea consumption in Pusa Basmati 1509 but also enhance its yield and improve brown head rice recovery [30] . This indicates that the combination of urea and Nano fertilizer is having a synergistic effect [31] . Improvement in brown head rice recovery will result in big gains for the rice industry. Hence, use of Nano fertilizer is a win–win situation for the farmers as well as Rice Industry both.   5 Conclusion Nanofertilizers are important in agriculture to increase crop yield by improving the nutrient use efficiency, and to reduce indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers such as di-ammonium phosphate and urea. The farmers of Punjab excessively apply urea in PUSA Basmati 1509 the widely grown Basmati variety. Amongst the six different nutrient sources nanofertilizer (Fe3 O4 ) prepared by using co-precipitation technique increased the Pusa Basmati 1509 yield with just 40% urea. Thus, it was found to be a cost effective measure too. Besides, nanofertilizer in combination with urea improved the quality attributes of PUSA Basmati 1509 with respect to percentage brown head rice [32] . Nanofertilizer in this way can act as a boon for the farming community and rice industry [33] . Other than commercial significance nanofertilizer may help farmers in achieving the sustainable development goal in agriculture in the cereal based system.
