                  This study investigates the impact of digital financial inclusion, energy transition, and diversification on achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Climate Change Conference (COP26) targets in the context of emerging seven economies (E-7). The SDGs include objectives related to sustainable energy consumption, the availability of sustainable energy, economic growth, sustainable development through technology, and climate change actions. This research employs novel econometric panel quantile regression and ordinary least square methods for benchmark estimations and pooled mean group for causality analysis. The empirical results indicate that energy transition and diversification, technological innovation, and foreign direct investment negatively correlate with CO2 emissions across all quantiles. Conversely, digital finance inclusion, energy consumption, and economic growth are the primary contributors to the environmental deterioration in the E-7 region. The PMG causality findings demonstrate a feedback effect for the indicators. Furthermore, our results are robust to alternative measures by Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG), which may assist policymakers in developing long- and short-term environmental protection initiatives. Based on the outcomes, we suggest that strategies to reduce carbon emissions and achieve the SDGs and COP26 targets should prioritize sustainable energy, and policymakers should enhance incentives for inclusive green funding. The findings recommend a comprehensive policy framework through which E-7 states may proceed toward reaching the SDGs (7-8-9-11-12 and 13) and COP26 commitments.

Handling Editor: A. Sinha Graphical abstract       This study investigates the impact of digital financial inclusion, energy transition, and diversification on achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Climate Change Conference (COP26) targets in the context of emerging seven economies (E-7). The SDGs include objectives related to sustainable energy consumption, the availability of sustainable energy, economic growth, sustainable development through technology, and climate change actions. This research employs novel econometric panel quantile regression and ordinary least square methods for benchmark estimations and pooled mean group for causality analysis. The empirical results indicate that energy transition and diversification, technological innovation, and foreign direct investment negatively correlate with CO2  emissions across all quantiles. Conversely, digital finance inclusion, energy consumption, and economic growth are the primary contributors to the environmental deterioration in the E-7 region. The PMG causality findings demonstrate a feedback effect for the indicators. Furthermore, our results are robust to alternative measures by Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG), which may assist policymakers in developing long- and short-term environmental protection initiatives. Based on the outcomes, we suggest that strategies to reduce carbon emissions and achieve the SDGs and COP26 targets should prioritize sustainable energy, and policymakers should enhance incentives for inclusive green funding. The findings recommend a comprehensive policy framework through which E-7 states may proceed toward reaching the SDGs (7-8-9-11-12 and 13) and COP26 commitments.   Keywords Digital financial inclusion  Energy transition and diversification  Sustainable development goals  COP26    1 Introduction Since 1972, the United Nations has been committed to finding solutions to environmental problems. The Kyoto Protocol, established in 2005 to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, calls for a 5% reduction between 2008 and 2012 (Samour et al., 2022 ). The Paris Agreement was signed in 2015 and addressed preventing climate changes, energy transition guidelines and green finance to keep the target level of global warming at 2 °C (Sowah and Kirikkaleli, 2022; Abbasi et al., 2022 ). The UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda and (SDGs-17) in March 2015, with 17 goals (socio-economic, climate development challenges), 169 targets, and 330 indicators. According to (Sinha et al., 2021 ), many SDGs are connected to sustainable and renewable energy and its favourable effects on health, well-being, and living quality. By concentrating on attempts to create a complete measuring framework, this work aims to develop the most significant SDGs indicators, such as UN-SDGs (7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13), as shown in Fig. 1  . According to the (Renewable Energy Agency, 2021 ), energy consumption will rise by 50% by 2050. Consequently, the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) gathered in Glasgow in November 2021 and reached a treaty to achieve global net zero emissions by the 2050 s (Dogan et al., 2022 ). The COP26 prioritizes steps until 2030 to keep 1.5 °C alive and bring CO2  emissions to zero by the 2050 s; it calls on countries to accelerate the energy transition and diversification for increased energy security, adaptability, and affordable energy. Similarly, the European Green Deal treaty targets reducing greenhouse emissions (GHG) by 60% by 2030, keeping global warming at 1.5 °C, and implementing a zero-carbon approach by 2050 (REA, 2021). According to the conference's website, the essential goal for SDG-7 (clean and sustainable energy) and SDG-12 (energy consumption and production) in the energy sector is to “achieve worldwide net zero” SDGs-13 (climate change) carbon emissions by the 2050 s. (Shahbaz et al., 2022 ) with the fast transition of old and new drivers of the global economy, the global community has reached an agreement (COP26) on the essential of producing clean, low-carbon renewable resources to address these problems. The summary outcome of COP26 crystallizes the energy transition's direction, calling on all 197 Parties1  1 Despite the fact that several nations, including Libya, Turkey, Iran, Yemen, and Iraq, have not joined the Paris treaty. (Turkey is the part of our study and member nation of the E-7 bloc).   to the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development to “rapidly upgrade clean, renewable power and accelerate exertions towards the phasedown of unhindered coal plants and phase-out of ineffective subsidies for fossil fuels. From the discussion above, this paper examines the causes of environmental degradation and proposes a policy framework for reaching SDG-13 (climate action), SDG-12 (energy consumption), SDG-7 (green and sustainable energy), SDG-9 (TINs), and SDG-8 (economic growth), see Fig. 2  . This action demonstrates governments' desire to avoid environmental damage to achieve SDGs by 2030 and COP26 targets by the 2050 s. Over time, energy transition and diversification have evolved as an interdisciplinary field of research (Udemba & Tosun, 2022 ). The energy transition is not confined to the move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. It must also address sustainable energy production's social, economic, and environmental dimensions (Saldivia Olave & Vargas-Payera, 2020 ). Therefore, “energy transition” refers to transitioning the world energy industry from fossil-based to zero-carbon. Furthermore, diversification into new segments and markets is crucial as the industry increasingly focuses on energy transition and the path to net zero. Many enterprises realize that their technology can be applied to various industries. In the energy transition context, diversification is the expansion of oil and gas firms' core fossil fuel operations into new low-carbon energy market segments and products (Kirikkaleli et al., 2022 ). In order to monitor the functioning of energy systems at the international, national, and local levels, various organizations have established energy indicators. The World Bank; the International Energy Agency (IEA); and the (Renewable Energy Agency, 2021 ) are a few examples. Two major concerns in the world's energy transitional phase are increased energy utilization and CO2  emission constraints (Salazar-Núñez et al., 2022 ). Global energy consumption is continually growing and is anticipated to reach 600–1500 EJ by 2050. The objective of our research is to investigate specific energy utilization problems (SDGs-7, 11 and 12), see Figs. 3 and 4    with a focus on renewable and sustainable energy consumption to avoid issues related to (SDG-13) climate change and transmittal accessibility to affordable green energy by 2030 by investing in environmentally friendly renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and thermal. Consequently, the energy transition and diversification with policy frameworks are critical factors in accomplishing the objective of SDGs and COP26 targets. Thus, this research is motivated by COP26 (direction toward energy transition and diversification) to attain net zero emissions by 2050 s and the (SDGs 7, 12, 11 and 13) by 2030 s. The finance industry has evolved as an essential driver of the low-carbon energy transition (Kirikkaleli & Adebayo, 2021 ). In the modern era, Scholars and policymakers pay attention to the role of energy transition and digital financial inclusion because they have the potential to reduce environmental risks and energy cost saving. After establishing microcredit, micro-finance, and financial inclusion, digital financial inclusion is the fourth phase of the financial revolution (Wang et al., 2022 ). DFI aims to provide financial facilities through digital channels to all entities, communities, businesses, and institutions, assisting in alleviating poverty, increasing financial intermediation, and achieving the SDGs and COP26 targets. Thus, digital financial inclusion promotes sustainable economic and social development and a sustainable energy transition and accelerates momentum toward the SDGs and COP26. Meanwhile, those incapable of accessing digital financial facilities, such as rural populations, the poor, the uneducated, and the elderly, will impede advancement toward DFI. So therefore, to alleviate poverty and improve the well-being of their citizens, E-7 nations rely significantly on imported fossil fuels due to their rising energy demands caused by population increase and dynamic economic progress. Hence financial safety, which is directly associated with energy security, therefore remains an issue for E-7 nations. As a result, they will fall behind in achieving the SDGs by 2030 and COP26 by 2050 s. To meet the SDGs goals and the COP26 objectives, a net investment need of US$100 billion has been estimated globally. Similarly, Energy system investment requirements have been projected at US$ 1.6–3.8 trillion annually from 2020 to 2050 to maintain efficient systems and avoid adverse climate consequences. Furthermore, energy transition investment must expand by 30% beyond projected investment to a total of 131 trillion $ between now and 2050 while generating a total payoff of at least 61$ trillion by 2050. As a result, the successful implementation of DFI contributes to the achievement of 13 of the 17 SDGs (Tay et al., 2022 ). Based on these statements, we observed that in the E-7 nations, green investment or green financing is becoming a substantial element of standard capital markets, emphasizing low emissions and sustainable energy. Furthermore, DFI might be one of the significant factors in achieving the SDGs by 2030 and the COP26 objectives by 2050. The current study investigates the best means of achieving SDGs and COP26 in E-72  2 E-7, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China Mexico, Indonesia and turkey.   economies (Fig. 4 ). The world is progressing on SDGs 7,8,9,11,12, and 13 of ensuring access to sustainable societies, green finance, and affordable clean energy transition and diversification to achieve net zero emission to achieve SDGs by 2030 and COP26 targets by 2050. However, the E-7 nations remain distant from this ideal path of SDGs and COP26 targets. Furthermore, these states face many problems in achieving SDGs and COP26, from which climate change and global warming are their leading subjects. The E-7 comprises mainly emerging economies (see Fig. 4 ) that have not reached a significant level of industrial development (Gyamfi et al., 2022 ) but are looking to develop. E-7 economies might exceed G-7 by 2032 (Huang et al., 2022 ). Before the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, E-7 GDP was 22.37 trillion $, compared to G-7 38.46 trillion dollars (Zhen et al., 2022 ). The E-7 bloc is anticipated to have the most substantial economic growth by the 2050 s, and their energy consumption will undoubtedly upsurge. In 2018, they comprised 47% of the global population, 26% of the global GDP, and 40% of global energy use. Hence significant economic growth and energy demand in these economies boost CO2  emissions. In the top 20th list of the world's largest CO2  emitters, China 9300 Mt, India 2200 Mt, Indonesia 496.4, Russia 1500 Mt, Mexico 446.0 Mt, and Turkey 378.6 Mt are in this classification (Renewable Energy Agency, 2021 ). In 2019, China contributed 28.75% of worldwide carbon emissions, while the other E-7 economies contributed 17.33%, making the E-7 responsible for 46.08% of global carbon emissions. More specifically, according to (Bu & Ali, 2022 ) global primary energy consumption, these E-7 nations enhance carbon emissions significantly: China (23.8%), India (5.9%), Russia (5.1%), Turkey (1.12%), Indonesia (1.53%), Brazil (2.13%), and Mexico (1.32%) respectively. Other E-7 studies show similar energy consumption patterns (Irfan & Ojha, 2022; Lin & Wu, 2022; Onifade et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2021 ). In summary, in 2019, the E-7 states contributed to approximately 41.26% of the world's primary energy consumption (Renewable Energy Agency, 2021 ). The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by addressing the following research questions:(1) Can the emerging seven (E-7) economies achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and the targets set by the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) by 2050 through the adoption of digital financial inclusion, energy transition, and diversification, as well as other macroeconomic indicators?  (2) Can financial inclusion tools support a sustainable development path and promote sustainable economic growth in the E-7 countries?  (3) Can the E-7 countries achieve COP26 targets and improve energy productivity and safety through sustainable energy transition and diversification? Moreover, how do digital finance and renewable energy adoption contribute to carbon reduction in the E-7 countries?    In summary, the approach adopted in the study is innovative as it is the first attempt to examine the potential impact of digital financial inclusion, energy transition, and diversification on environmental degradation in the E-7 context, intending to achieve the SDGs and COP26 targets. The study highlights the critical role of digital financial inclusion in promoting financial development and green financing and suggests that its impact on environmental sustainability may be either harmful or beneficial, particularly in the E-7 countries. The study employs a multidimensional approach, utilizing the DFI index as a tool for analysis, which has not been explored previously in the literature for these economies. In order to analyze the sustainable development of the E-7 bloc, the study employs a combination of novel empirical methods. The study considers the cross-sectional dependency within specific nations and employs ordinary least square (OLS), Panel quantile regression (PQR) and AMG-CCEMG methods to accommodate this issue and generate more accurate and robust results for the relationship between under-observed parameters. Additionally, the study examines pooled mean group (PMG) causality relations among the indicators to effectively and efficiently illustrate the E-7′s progress towards achieving the SDGs and COP26 commitments using the PMG causality technique. Overall, the proposed study employs a rigorous and multidisciplinary approach to contribute new insights to the literature on sustainable development and the role of digital finance and renewable energy adoption in reducing carbon emissions in the E-7 countries. The analysis indicates that policymakers must carefully consider the role of digital finance and energy transitions in shaping policies that support environmental sustainability. To promote sustainability, it is recommended that developing economies prioritize the expansion and enhancement of their digital finance infrastructure. Additionally, green energy initiatives should focus on leveraging the potential of digital finance to facilitate sustainable economic growth and technological advancement. By identifying and promoting the interconnections between digital finance and sustainable energy, policymakers can create policies that foster a more sustainable future for all. Additionally, the analysis gives relevant policy implications to ensure sustainable practices. It can build a solid policy foundation for the expedited transformation of the present energy system to reach COP26 targets and sustainable development goals in the E-7 bloc.

Conclusion and policy recommendations.  2 Literature review Climate change and environmental degradation are major global challenges requiring urgent action from policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders. To achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and the targets set by the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) by 2050, various measures have been proposed to curb carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions and reduce the impact of human activities on the environment (Gyamfi et al., 2022; Samour et al., 2022; Udemba & Tosun, 2022 ). These measures include the adoption of renewable energy sources, the implementation of sustainable development policies, and the promotion of digital financial inclusion. This section discusses and provides recent relevant literature. 2.1 Energy transition and diversification (ETD) and environmental degradation (CO2 ) Energy is the most significant contributor to global warming, accounting for over 60% of worldwide GHGs. According to (Adebayo & Kirikkaleli, 2021 ), the fundamental cause of global climate change is CO2  emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are reliable economic stimulants, but they have serious environmental and health repercussions, such as CO2  emissions and environmental degradation (Kirikkaleli & Adebayo, 2021 ). Since fossil fuels have dominated the global energy markets for many years, there is serious concern about mitigating the risk of increasing GHGs and energy diffidence through low-carbon energy initiatives such as energy transition and diversification, energy productivity improvements, CO2  sequestration, and several others (Irfan & Ojha, 2022 ). Many studies have been examined to investigate ETD, primarily from two perspectives: fossil to non-fossil (e.g., wind, solar, and hydropower) transitions and alternatives across different fossil fuels, as exemplified by coal-to-gas transitions (Khan et al., 2021 ; S. Khan et al., 2022; Neofytou et al., 2020 ). Energy transitions and diversification are critical for pushing action on various fronts, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and the coal transition at the heart of climate change (Tang et al., 2022 ). (Udemba & Tosun, 2022 ) to promote sustainable development, scientific methodologies ARDL test and granger causality were used for Brazil from 1970 to 2018 and examined that ETD harms CO2  emissions, improving Brazil's environmental quality. According to a recent study by (Tang et al., 2022 ), energy transitions mitigate environmental degradation and improve environmental quality in BRICS nations. Similarly, the study (Ahmed et al., 2022a, 2022b, 2022c ) adopted the AARDL approach. The study's findings revealed that green energy decreases environmental deterioration in Pakistan's economy. (Gielen et al., 2019 ) contend that in the energy mix transformation process, ETD positively influences each other. As a result of these investigations, it was proved that energy efficacy might be utilized as a strategy for environmental sustainability (Destek & Sinha, 2020 ). Several studies have investigated how energy (both renewable energy consumption (REC) and non-renewable (NREC) affects environmental deterioration. (Danish et al., 2017 ) evidence of non-NREC consumption raising CO2  emissions and REC consumption preventing CO2  emissions in Pakistan from 1970 to 2012. (Bekun et al., 2019; Alola et al., 2019 ) studied CO2  emissions and renewable and non-renewable energy (RE and NRE) consumptions in European Union nations. Using PMG-ARDL, the outcomes showed that RE and NRE consumption increases and decreases CO2  emissions levels, respectively. (Destek & Sinha, 2020 ) the findings of the study revealed that RE mitigates ecological footprint and increases environmental sustainability in the 24 OECD economies and NRE increases environmental degradation in the OECD region from 1980 to 2014. (Sharif et al., 2020 ) re-evaluated RE and NRE consumption on Turkey's environmental problems, the results show that the RE utilization lowers each quantile's environmental impact over time, while in the long to short term, economic growth and NRE consumption reduce the environmental cost for all quantiles. (Khan et al., 2020; Kirikkaleli et al., 2022 ) using ARDL and the findings show that NREC and ECG boost CO2  emissions. According to the statistics, using RE reduced GHG emissions (Li et al., 2022 ; Onifade et al., 2022; Samour et al., 2022; Usman et al., 2021 ). Recently, (Doğan et al., 2021 ) asserted encouraging RE consumption can decrease CO2  in 28 OECD nations from 1990 to 2014. Consequently, renewable energy is considered an eco-friendly energy resource that may be exploited to eliminate dependence on fossil fuels and restore the environment's health. (Yoshino et al., 2021 ) sustainable energy is required to ensure energy security and to accomplish SDGs 7 and 13. Furthermore, to solve the concerns and difficulties of ETD and climate change and expedite its development, many researchers have focused on potential factors such as FDI, ECG, poverty, financial inclusion, financial development, urbanization and innovation instance (Adom et al., 2020; Ahmed et al., 2022a, 2022b, 2022cAhmed et al., 2022a, 2022b, 2022c; Kirikkaleli et al., 2022; Udemba & Tosun, 2022 ). Thus, the studies, in particular, have neglected the importance of ETD in estimating the impact of DFI on environmental deterioration. Therefore, SDGs-7, 11 and 12 and COP26 target zero-emission has resolved to decrease fossil fuel consumption by deploying more energy transition and diversification (Gyamfi et al., 2022; Udemba & Tosun, 2022 ).  2.2 Digital financial inclusion (DFI) and environmental degradation (CO2 ) Aside from economic growth, energy transition, and diversification, DFI has caught the attention of policymakers and scholars as an environmental policy instrument. DFI is an essential component of financial inclusion (FNI). According to (Tay et al., 2022 ), DFI is a facilitator for FNI, contributing to the attainment of sustainable development. FNI ensures that all countries can access and use financial goods and services to reap long-term economic advantages (Qin et al., 2021 ). FNI can enhance or deteriorate environmental quality (Ahmed et al., 2022a, 2022b, 2022c ). Fareed et al. (2022) , the connection between FNI and CO2  emissions in 27 European economies during 1995–2018, found that FNI boosts CO2  emissions. (Ullah et al., 2022a ) The influence of FNI on CO2  revealed that FNI increases CO2  emissions and decreases environmental sustainability in OECD. Similarly, (Ahmad et al., 2022 ) verified the harmful influence of FNI on environmental degradation for BRICS. Furthermore, there are many studies between the digital economy and environmental degradation, such as (Kovacikova et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022a; Shahbaz et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022 ), while the relationship between DFI and environmental deterioration is scant and neglected. According to a few relevant literature studies, digital finance is a relatively new concept in the financial sector in which innovation is employed to improve financial operations (Chishti & Sinha, 2022 ). According to the review article of (Tay et al., 2022 ), DFI is vital to ensuring that all individuals have access to digital financial facilities and, consequently, to promoting sustainable financial development and the boosting of digital financial inclusion must be aligned with and contribute to the 2030 SDGs. A recent study (Ozturk & Ullah, 2022 ) using OLS, 2SLS, and GMM approaches for 42-Belt and Road economies from 2007 to 2019 found a relationship between DFI, economic growth and environmental sustainability; the outcomes revealed that DFI rises economic growth but increased CO2  emissions and decrease environmental quality. (Wang et al., 2022 ) explored the linking between DFI and CO2  in 284 cities in China and utilized the spatial econometric technique. The research found the positive influence of DFI on CO2  in China cities. Chishti & Sinha (2022)  analyzed the dynamic relationship between FNI and environmental degradation in BRICS countries using panel data approaches, i.e., Augmented Mean group and least square models. The research showed that positive financial innovation shocks reduce CO2 emissions. Nonetheless, negative shocks in FNI increase CO2 emissions. According to (Ma et al., 2022b ), DFI can potentially boost technological innovation. On the one hand, innovations in green technology can significantly cut CO2  emissions. On the other side, technological innovation can potentially cut production costs. There is a dearth of literature on the role of DFI in environmental sustainability. Therefore, the nexus between DFI, energy, and the environment is not conclusively proven. The significance of digital finance, energy transition, diversification, and climate change are of serious concern. Therefore, digitalization can expedite the deployment of sustainable energy and renewable energy technologies, as increasing mechanization and database management reduce energy utilization and enhance environmental quality to meet the SDGs by 2030 and COP26 by 2050.  2.3 Studies E-7 economies towards SDGs and COP26 targets The 2030–2050 agenda encourages associate nations to protect the planet from further deterioration by implementing sustainability initiatives such as sustainable resource consumption and production of green energy transitions, sustainable conservation and management of the earth's resources, as well as preventing climate (Kabeyi & Olanrewaju, 2022; Kirikkaleli & Adebayo, 2021 ). In recent years, stimulating economic growth, meeting energy needs with lower greenhouse gas emissions, and ensuring energy generation sustainability have been key challenges for emerging seven (E7) economies (Gyamfi et al., 2020 ). (Gyamfi et al., 2022 ) utilized the quantile regression for E-7 economies over the period 1990–2016, and outcomes revealed that RE utilizations increase the quality of the environment. This objective is consistent with UN-SDGs-7, 11, 12, and 13, emphasizing responsible energy usage (renewables), accessibility to sustainable energy, and preventing climate change. (Irfan et al., 2022 ) considered the association between FDI and energy diversification for the E-7 bloc and utilized the Panel ARDL-PMG approaches for 1992–2017. Outcomes show that the homogeneous long-run results indicate that raising FDI inflows stimulates energy diversification while improving energy efficiency discourages it. (Anwar et al., 2022 ) studied to achieve SDGs by examining the relationship between technological innovation and institutional quality to address environmental degradation issues, utilized the FGLS approach for 1996–2020, and recommended SDGS-oriented policy implications for E-7economies that can progress towards achieving the objectives of SDGs (16-13-7-8-9). (Qin et al., 2021 ), examine the consequences of FNI on CO2  emissions, globalization, and renewable electricity generation for the developing seven economies from 2004 to 2016. This study employs E-7 quantile regression. Long-run coefficient estimates from the PQR study showed that it reduces CO2  in the lower polluted E-7 nations. Globalization and renewable power generation cut E7 countries' CO2  emissions. (Lin & Wu, 2022 ), This study aims to investigate these factors' impact on CO2  emissions from 2004 to 2009 in the E-7 bloc, using the PQR for long-run estimates. The empirical data show that energy efficiency is inversely related to CO2  emissions across all quantiles. However, the major contributors to CO2  emissions are FNI, ECG, globalization, and the composite risk index. The UN SDGs (SDGs-7, 8,9,11, 12 and 13) focus on sustainable societies, economic growth, sustainable industrialization, green innovation, access to green and clean energy, and production and consumption to mitigate global warming and achieving zero net emissions by SDGs-2030 and COP26-2050.   3 Methodology 3.1 Theoretical framework and discerption of data The study aims to investigate the impacts of digital financial inclusion, energy transition and diversification, and other macroeconomic indicators to ensure that COP26 targets net zero emissions and UN-SDGs for sustainability within the E-7 bloc. This result is consistent with SDGs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13), which emphasize responsible energy consumption and production (renewables), access to clean energy, investment in green finance and technological innovation, and mitigation of climate change to achieved net zero emissions, SDGs by 2030 and COP26 targets by 2050. The empirical research suggests that DFI has either negative or positive effects on environmental degradation, but the impact of DFI on CO2  is conflicted and scarce. A recent study (Ozturk & Ullah, 2022 ) revealed that DFI mitigates environmental quality and increases CO2  emissions. In contrast, the work of (Ma et al., 2022b ) negatively influences CO2  emissions. Hence the nexus of DFI-CO2  could be ambiguous; it could be (-) impact on CO2  emissions in the region or could be (+) on CO2 ; β 1  = δ C O  2 , i t    δ D F I  it     < 0 . o r  β 1  = δ C O  2 , i t    δ D F I  it     > 0 .     According to the framework and above studies (Shahbaz et al., 2022; Gyamfi et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2022 ), the (SDGs 7, 11 and 12) ETD should be influenced by numerous elements such as population, economics, and innovation. ETD are now widely acknowledged as an effective, low-cost way to tackle the escalating issue of CO2  emissions (Irfan & Ojha, 2022; Udemba & Tosun, 2022 ). Therefore, the research recommended that the ETD mitigates negative impacts and reduces emissions to promote sustainability practices. As a result, it is reasonable to anticipate that the energy transition hurts CO2  emissions; β 2  = δ C O  2 , i t    δ E T D  it     < 0   . Technological innovation (TIN) SDG 9 (sustainable industrialization through innovation), the outcome of TIN could be ambiguous either (+) or (-) on environmental degradation in the E-7 countries as; β 3  = δ C O  2 , i t    δ T I N  it     > 0 ,    (Onifade et al., 2022; Anwar et al., 2022 ;) and while the study of (Ahmed et al., 2022c ) supported that TIN curbs CO2  emissions in G-7 β 3  = δ C O  2 , i t    δ T I N  it     < 0   . Energy consumption (ENC) is measured by fuel fossil fuel prices. The effect of fossil fuel prices on CO2  emissions is positive (Ali et al., 2021; Jianguo et al., 2022; Ullah et al., 2022b ); therefore, the influence on CO2  emissions could be positive. β 4  = δ C O  2 , i t    δ E N C  it     > 0 .    Furthermore, investigating economic growth (ECG) (SDG-8) study has revealed that a rise in ECG significantly boosts demand for energy consumption. Thus, increasing demand expands energy consumption, growing CO2  emissions (Kirikkaleli et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2021 ). Therefore, the ECG could encourage emissions in the area, expressed as: β 5  = δ C O  2 , i t    δ E C G  it     > 0 .    Furthermore, FDI encourages using renewable energy by increasing market investment activity (Tiwari et al., 2022 ). FDI, on the other hand, supports rapid industrialization, which is unfavourable to transforming sustainable energy. As a result, FDI is a significant factor influencing ETD, but the potential direction of effect is unidentified (Shahbaz et al., 2022 ). Thus, the outcome of FDI on CO2  could be positive or negative in the E-7 economies and expressed; β 6  = δ C O  2 , i t    δ F D I  it     > 0 .    Or β 6  = δ C O  2 , i t    δ F D I  it     < 0 .    Our study used CO2  emission (CO2  metric tons/capita) for climate change proxy as a dependent variable. We construct a composite principal index (PCA) of digital financial inclusion index (atm 1000 per adult, debit card (% age + 15) and the number of money mobile accounts, and for energy transition and diversification proxied by (share of primary energy from renewable resources (%). We also used other parameters, technological innovation Patents (resident, non-resident), energy consumption (fossil fuels energy consumption (% of total), economic growth (constant 2010, US$), foreign direct investment (FDI% GDP). The data on access and usage are compiled using global data sources, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Financial Data-stream for DFI indicators-(2007–2020), OECD database and Our world in data. Considering the literature reviews and the review work of (Tay et al., 2022 ) and the recent studies (Dogan et al., 2022; Ozturk & Ullah, 2022; Shahbaz et al., 2022; Udemba & Tosun, 2022 ).  3.2 Econometric specification In Eqs. (1) and (2) , the research function and econometric model are described:(1) C  O   2   = f  D  F  I  + E  T  D  + T  N  I  + E  N  C  + E  C  G  + F  D  I          We convert all parameters to their natural log to allow for elastic interpretations. Log-linear data is more efficient and consistent than linear data (Jianguo et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2021 ). Below is a log-linear representation of the function;(2) C  O  2  i  t    = β  0  + β  1  D  F  I   i  t    + β  2  E  T  D   i  t    + β  3  T N I  i t   + β   4  E  N  C   i  t    + β   5  E  C  G   i  t    + β  6  F  D  I   i  t    + ε   i  t         In Eqs. (1) and (2) , Whereβ  0     = slope of coefficients, i  shows the cross sections, t  shows the time of the study. The parameters depicted by β 1  and β2… β6 are the parameters. C  O   2     refers to corban dioxide emission while the ε  is the residual term. The study has derived the empirical model based on a theoretical understanding of the relationship between DFI, ETD and control indicators such as (TNI, ENC, GDP and FDI), and on CO2  emissions in the E-7 nations. DFI has been included in the model as it is an important factor in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) and can contribute to a low-carbon economy by improving access to financial services and promoting sustainable investment. ETD is included as it represents the transition to a low-carbon economy through the development of renewable energy sources, energy-efficient technologies, and the reduction of reliance on fossil fuels. TNI is included as it represents the development and adoption of new technologies that can contribute to sustainable development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ENC is included as it represents the demand for energy, which is a major source of CO2  emissions. GDP and FDI are included as they are important factors in economic growth and can be correlated with increased energy consumption and CO2  emissions. The study used the general form of a linear regression model to express the relationship between CO2  emissions and the independent variables. Hence, the study has derived the empirical model based on a theoretical understanding of the factors that influence CO2  emissions and using a methodological framework to estimate the relationship between these factors and CO2  emissions in E-7 nations to achieve SDGs and COP26 commitments.  3.3 Methodological framework After establishing research designs and linear models, this study utilized econometric strategies for empirical estimation (see Fig. 5  ). These methods include the normality test, slope heterogeneity (SH) test, panel cross-section dependence (CSD), panel stationarity test CIPS and CADF) test, second-generation cointegration, long-run panel quantile regression (PQR) estimation regression and pooled mean group (PMG) causality test. Followed by CSD and SH tests (Jianguo et al., 2022 ) highlight that CSD is difficult with panel data because of globalization. For example, territories are connected by trade agreements, culture, border sharing, and economical and social (Kirikkaleli et al., 2022; Ullah et al., 2022a, Ullah et al. 2022b ). Furthermore, it is often acknowledged that disruption in the CD of panel data occurs mainly when the cross sections are large in frequency. Nonetheless, there is substantial evidence that CD usually occurs in panel data models. We use (Pesaran, 2021 ) CD analysis: Similarly, this work also investigates for SH test using the (Pesaran & Yamagata, 2008 ) technique. Delta tilde and adjusted delta tilde are tested (Pesaran & Yamagata, 2008 ). The alternative suggests that the slope is not homogenous for all cross-sections, according to the null hypothesis. 3.3.1 Second-generation panel unit-root test The integration order of the parameters is tested after generating CSD and SH tests. The 1st generation unit root has a limited ability to handle the underlying difficulties of CD (Ali et al., 2021 ), but the 2nd generation of the panel unit root addresses the shortcomings of CD in the first-generation assessments. Therefore, we employ panel unit-root ISP (CIPS) and ADF tests (CADF) for stationary analysis.  3.3.2 Second-generation panel cointegration test Further, the long-run associations among environmental degradation, DFI, ETD, TIN, ENC, ECG and FDI. Relevant factors can be used to construct sustainability practices if a cointegration correlation is formed. Therefore, the presence of cointegration can be an essential guide for policymakers. In this context, cointegration among indicators can be examined using the second-generation cointegration test after recognizing the unit root properties of the indicators. We used the (Westerlund, 2007; Pedroni, 2004; Kao, 1999; Johansen, 1988 ) panel cointegration tests in the research. According to (Ullah et al., 2022a ), the cointegration analysis focuses on eliminating numerous unnecessary test methodologies to provide appropriate assessments of the real issue generated by other cointegration tests. However, for the empirical evidence, this research used the PQR approach suggested by (Koenker & Bassett, 1978 ).   3.4 Long run estimation 3.4.1 Ordinary least square (OLS) and panel quantile regression (PQR) Once the prerequisites for long-run estimates, such as normality, CSD, SH, CIPS, CADF and second-generation cointegration techniques, have been examined, it is critical to regress the parameters under investigation with an effective estimator. The study employed OLS and PQR. The presence of a cointegration test examines a long-term relationship using OLS regression. The study used (Driscoll & Kraay, 1998 ) OLS with standard errors. This technique considers heteroscedasticity, CSD and serial correlation. Nonetheless, the PQR is a statistical technique selected for its advantages over the OLS (Gyamfi et al., 2022 ). Therefore, this work used the PQR approach (Koenker & Bassett, 1978 ). This work employs quantile regression since standard regression estimators over and under-estimate coefficients and only offer the average impact. (Huang et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2021 ) defined quantile regression as having additional benefits over classical regression, such as (1) it offers a sequence of coefficients throughout the conditional distribution, (2) associated with traditional mean regression, PQR may offer complete statistical results, (3) PQR is more suited in the existence of outliers, and (4) PQR is more successful when the assessment of standard errors is not accurate. It also addresses CSD and SH coefficient constraints. Additionally, as the E7 nations' CO2  emission levels vary considerably, it is more pertinent to quantify the implications at different CO2  emission quantiles (Anwar et al., 2022; Gyamfi et al., 2022; Lin & Wu, 2022 ). The estimation equation for PQR is given as we follow the equations of (Qin et al., 2021 ):(3) Q  C  O  2 i  t    θ  ∖ π i  , δ t  , X i , t      = π i  + δ t  + α  1 , θ    D  F  I   i  , t    + α  2 , θ    E  T  D   i  , t    + α  3 , θ    T  I  N   i  , t    + α  4 , θ    E  C  G   i  , t    + α  5 , θ    F  D  I   i  , t    + ε   θ  , i  , t         This research looks at how each factor will impact CO2  emissions over the four quantiles, i.e., Q  0.25   , Q  0.50   , Q  0.75 a  n  d    Q  0.95      for models, respectively. Listed below are the precise equations for each quantile:(4) Q  0.25   ( C  O   2  )  = π 0.25   + ϑ  1 , 0.25   D  F  I   i  , t    + ϑ  2 , 0.25   E  T  D   i  , t    + ϑ  3 , 0.25   T  I  N   i  , t    + ϑ  4 , 0.25   E  C  G   i  , t    + ϑ  5 , 0.25   F  D  I   i  , t    + ε   0.25 , i  , t        (5) Q  0.50   ( C  O   2  )  = π 0.50   + ϑ  1 , 0.50   D  F  I   i  , t    + ϑ  2 , 0.50   E  T  D   i  , t    + ϑ  3 , 0.50   T  I  N   i  , t    + ϑ  4 , 0.50   E  C  G   i  , t    + ϑ  5 , 0.50   F  D  I   i  , t    + ε   0.50 , i  , t        (6) Q  0.75   ( C  O   2  )  = π 0.75   + ϑ  1 , 0.75   D  F  I   i  , t    + ϑ  2 , 0.75   E  T  D   i  , t    + ϑ  3 , 0.75   T  I  N   i  , t    + ϑ  4 , 0.75   E  C  G   i  , t    + ϑ  5 , 0.75   F  D  I   i  , t    + ε   0.75 , i  , t        (7) Q  0.95   ( C  O   2  )  = π 0.95   + ϑ  1 , 0.95   D  F  I   i  , t    + ϑ  2 , 0.95   E  T  D   i  , t    + ϑ  3 , 0.95   T  I  N   i  , t    + ϑ  4 , 0.95   E  C  G   i  , t    + ϑ  5 , 0.95   F  D  I   i  , t    + ε   0.95 , i  , t         From Eqs. (3)–(7) , PQR is given for 0.25th, 0.50th, 0.75th and 0.95th, respectively. After analyzing the PQR estimates, the current study examined the causal link between the indicators under discussion. As a result, we used the panel causality heterogeneous pooled mean group (PMG) causality approach.  3.4.2 Pooled mean group (PMG) causality test Applying the PMG estimator, we finally establish the direction of causality between the parameters. One of the key objectives for using PMG estimators is to differentiate short-term dynamics between economies while maintaining long-term values for all cross-sections.  3.4.3 Sensitivity test analysis, AMG-CCEMG We adopted the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG) for robustness analysis. In our research, we used the AMG approach developed by (Eberhardt, 2012 ) and CCEMG (Pesaran, 2006 )). Furthermore, These strategies handle cross-section dependence, heterogeneity, cointegration, and non-stationarity (Luo et al., 2021; Ullah et al., 2022a, Ullah et al. 2022b ).    4 Results and discussion The findings of the normality, CSD, and SH tests performed in this study are shown in Table 1  . First, the test statistics' statistical significance rejects the H0 of normal distribution for most variables in terms of the normality test. As a result, these estimates confirm that these indicators have a non-normal distribution, which supports the decision to apply a PQR estimation approach to forecast the coefficients across different quantiles of CO2  emission levels. Following the data normality test, this study examined the panel's SH and CSD tests, and their statistical outcomes are shown in Table 1 . In terms of CSD analysis, the (Pesaran, 2021 ) approach is used, which estimates test statistics to test the H0  of cross-sectional independence. We proceed by scrutinizing the CSD in the selected panel data set because it is critical for accurate outcomes. The results of these methodologies corroborate the H0  rejection at a 1% significance level; hence, indicators are subject to CSD. That means CO2 , DFI, ETD, TIN, ENC, ECG and FDI effects in one nation are also connected with other countries in the context of the E-7 bloc. Due to interdependence between governments, pandemics and financial shocks have repercussions via trading routes (Jianguo et al., 2022 ). As a result, H0  of the (Pesaran, 2021 ) CD test may be rejected, and it is determined that the E-7 nations rely on one another for various reasons. Current results are consistent with previous research (Lin & Wu, 2022 ). The (Hashem Pesaran & Yamagata, 2008 ) SH method is then employed to determine if the coefficient slopes are homogenous across models for different cross-sections. The statistical significance of the estimated test statistics rejects the H0  of slope homogeneity at the 1% level, confirming the SH issue. This result follows from the fact that, although having some comparable macroeconomic features, the E7 countries differ in several ways. For example, differences in income levels among the E-7 nations might have impacted the SH result. Similarly, the E-7 economies significantly differ regarding their CO2  emission levels and energy consumption. Concerns about SH in the data motivate adoption PQR estimators, which are well adapted to managing heterogeneous panel data sets (Lin & Wu, 2022; Qin et al., 2021 ). Following that, we examined the unit root in all specified indicators to determine the order of integration. Table 2   shows the findings of (Pesaran, 2007 ) CIPS unit root test. We cannot reject the null hypothesis of “no unit root at I (0).” We utilized features in the requirement to verify the unit root properties of the dataset. At the 1% significance level, the statistical significance of the test results rejects the H0  of non-stationarity, implying that at the first difference, all indicators are integrated, i.e., I (1). As a result, the unit root results propose a homogenous order of integration among the parameters analyzed in this research. The outcomes are similar to the prior research (Jianguo et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2021 ). After validating CSD, SH, and the same order of variable integration, the second-generation cointegration panel test is used in this study. The (Johansen, 1988; Kao, 1999; Pedroni, 2004; Westerlund, 2007 ) panel cointegration techniques are used to assess the long-run connections between the parameters. Table 3   summarizes the findings, which prove the existence of co-integrating equations in the econometric model adopted in this research. The (Westerlund, 2007 ) test comprises four specific test statistics, and the Ho  of all these statistics is that cointegration does not exist. The 1% group and panel statistics confirm this. The results of the (Pedroni, 2004 ) cointegration test finding show that the Ho  of “no cointegration” cannot be rejected. In contrast, the alternative hypothesis is accepted. These findings identify and validate the long-run cointegration of the model indicators examined. Similarly, the significance p-values of (Johansen, 1988; Kao, 1999 ) also check the presence of cointegration among the indicators. The findings align with the outcomes (Qin et al., 2021 ). Therefore, according to the second-generation cointegration test, all indicators in the present study are cointegrated, which proposes an effective long-term correlation among CO2, DFI, ETD, TIN, ENC, ECG, and FDI in E-7 countries). All of these empirical studies validate the existence of long-term cointegration among the parameters. Test statistics' statistical significance rejects the H0  of non-cointegration. As a result, long-run interactions between CO2 , DFI, ETD, TIN, ENC, ECG and FDI are stated in the E-7 bloc. Next, we employ the OLS and panel quantile (PQR) approaches to forecast the long-run marginal influences of the given indicators on environmental degradation in the context of the E-7 bloc. Table 4   presents the empirical results of the OLS and PQR. The estimated coefficients for the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th quantiles of CO2  emissions. For the 25th, 50th and 75T h quantiles, the outcome of DFI on environmental degradation is positive and significant. However, for the 95th quantile, the impact is found statistically insignificant. According to the findings, the average CO2  emissions in the E-7 countries increase when DFI is high. Increased DFI penetration can expand the availability of financial services, encouraging more enterprises to access the capital necessary to engage in activities that generate CO2  emissions, thereby raising CO2  emissions and decreasing the environmental quality in the E-7 bloc. DFI in the financial industry enables debit and credit card payments, internet payments, ATM withdrawals, mobile accounts, etc. Consequently, the number of economic transactions rises from the supply and demand sides, boosting the economy's development and harmful to the environment (Ozturk & Ullah, 2022 ). Hence, financial inclusion harms environmental quality, particularly in the comparably less polluted E-7 nations. Examining findings based on OLS demonstrates that OLS findings reveal a similar association between DFI and the environment. Indicating that a rise in DFI is beneficial for enhancing the industrial structure and fostering economic development in the E-7 nations. Based on the study's findings, it can be inferred that the current policies promoting digital financial inclusion in the E-7 nations may have unintended negative consequences for environmental quality. The study's outcome suggested policymakers could consider promoting green finance or investing in renewable energy sources to mitigate the environmental impacts of increased economic activity. Additionally, policies could be implemented to encourage businesses to adopt more sustainable practices and reduce their carbon footprint. Additionally, the study's findings call for policymakers to develop policies that balance economic growth with environmental sustainability, particularly in digital financial inclusion in the E-7 nations. Policymakers should explore ways to promote financial inclusion while mitigating the potential negative environmental impact of increased economic activity resulting from DFI. They should also consider the implications of DFI on achieving SDG goals and COP26 targets. On the other hand, the results propose that energy transition and diversification contribute significantly to environmental improvement in E-7 nations. ETD all quartiles (q25 , −0.4717, q50 , −0.5332, q75 , −8741 and q95 , −9357) established a negative and statistically significant correlation between ETD and CO2  emissions. The impacts of increased ETD output shares on CO2  emissions are negative and statistically significant at all quantiles. This indicates that adopting renewables (such as wind, solar, and hydropower) successfully reduces conventional energy and, resulting in CO2 emissions in E 7 and increasing environmental quality. The paradigm's OLS (-0.5911) finding is consistent with the quantile outcomes conclusion. This result helps the E-7 nations and demonstrates their transition from fossil fuel to green energy to combat escalating emission trends. Consequently, it can be stated that switching to sustainable energy is more beneficial for sustainable development in E-7 countries. Thus, the CO2  of E-7 decreases as the fraction of alternative energy to total primary energy rises. Since the E7 economies are among the top nations changing from non-renewable to renewable energy consumption, they are on the right track by increasing renewable energy consumption to achieve SDGs (7,11,12 and 13) and COP26 commitments. Reducing reliance on conventional energy would boost energy security and sustainable development. These findings parallel the conclusion (Gyamfi et al., 2022; Udemba & Tosun, 2022 ). The study highlights the need for the E-7 countries to switch to sustainable energy sources for sustainable development. This transition would reduce CO2 emissions, boost energy security, and foster sustainable economic development. The findings suggest that the E-7 nations are on the right track in increasing their renewable energy consumption and reducing reliance on conventional energy sources. The discussion of the study results should open up the threads of policy discussion, particularly regarding how the E-7 countries can further enhance their energy transition efforts. Policymakers can leverage the findings of this study to promote policies that encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources and reduce the dependence on non-renewable energy sources. Additionally, the results can inform the development of targeted policies to achieve the SDGs goals and COP26 targets in the E-7 countries. The relationship between ECG and CO2  emission is positive and significant across the quantiles. Specifically, a 1 % increase in the ECG of 0.9172, 1.0891, 1.0893 and 0.0779% in q0.25, q0.50, q0.075 and q0.095, respectively and in the case of OLS. This outcome shows that these E-7 economies accelerated their respective ECG rates. It is common knowledge that ECG evaluates the health of the economy. However, rapid industrialization and economic activity speed up the ECG but at the cost of environmental deterioration due to increasing energy usage in the household and industrial sectors. Similarly, higher ECG promotes ETD in the long term for emerging countries, implying that higher ECG leads to reduced energy diversification. This similar trend is reflected throughout the quantiles, which follows the (Gyamfi et al., 2022; Irfan & Ojha, 2022 ). The study's findings imply that the E-7 nations should strive to balance economic growth and environmental protection. In other words, they need to pursue sustainable development to avoid the negative consequences of economic growth on the environment. One possible policy response could be to invest in cleaner and more efficient technologies that reduce energy consumption and emissions while promoting economic growth. These policy responses would help the E-7 countries achieve the SDGs (7, 11, 12, and 13) and COP26 targets. By reducing their reliance on fossil fuels, the E-7 nations would contribute to the global effort to combat climate change while promoting sustainable economic growth. The long-run coefficient for FDI is predicted to be negative and significant in q0.25  and q0.50  and positive but insignificant in q0.75  and q0.95 . The negative sign shows that a rise in FDI inflow contributes to increased ETD in the long run for the E-7 members. The correlation between higher FDI inflows and improved access to sustainable energy technology and green financing in the E-7 economies of the host nation can justify the adverse influence of FDI on CO2. This result is identical to previous research indicating that FDI inflows boost the inclusion of alternative energy sources in the energy mix portfolios of developing countries (Irfan & Ojha, 2022; Shahbaz et al., 2022 ). This shows that the policy of FDI will be suitable for policy framing in mitigating CO2  emissions for E-7 and improving the environmental quality. These support findings from (Udemba & Tosun, 2022 ). TIN is a critical factor in environmental pollution reduction. The adverse effect of TIN on CO2  emission is that a rise in technological advancement leads to increased ETD in the long run for E-7 nations, signifying that TIN has contributed to higher energy transition and diversification. Furthermore, technological advancement works effectively in the digital economy, which expands incentives for practical environmental sustainability. This result demonstrates the E-7 nations' attempts to upgrade outmoded and polluted equipment with new and environmentally friendly technology. Boosting TIN has become a priority for E-7. This is because TIN helps countries to utilize renewable and alternative resources better, allowing for more variety in the ETD. As a result, between 1992 and 2018, China, Brazil, and India's patents increased by around 10601, 747, and 1361%, respectively (Peng et al., 2022 ). This finding validates the E-7 nations' attempts to adopt sophisticated, green energy-based technologies. Notably, SDG 9 proposes boosting innovation to support sustainable industrialization via building technology, which would aid in reducing fossil fuel consumption. Furthermore, TIN is being employed to increase the accessibility of renewables by increasing their output. This result is similar to those (Adebayo & Kirikkaleli, 2021; Anwar et al., 2022; Jianguo et al., 2022 ). However, energy consumption (ENC) is found to have a positive and highly significant relationship with CO2  emissions. This implies that E-7′s fossil fuel utilization leads to environmental quality degradation through increasing CO2  emissions. This equally supports the results from (Husnain et al., 2022; Kirikkaleli et al., 2022 ). The channel behind the positive relationship between energy consumption and CO2 emissions is that as energy consumption increases, so does economic growth. However, this growth often relies on fossil fuels, which can have significant environmental costs. Therefore, policymakers in E-7 nations need to prioritize sustainable development goals (SDGs) and COP26 targets to reduce CO2 emissions while promoting economic growth. This could involve transitioning to renewable energy sources, investing in energy-efficient technologies, and promoting sustainable consumption patterns. By doing so, E-7 nations can promote economic growth while reducing their impact on the environment and contributing to global efforts to mitigate climate change. Hence, the results of the empirical analysis suggest that policies aimed at promoting sustainable energy consumption patterns, promoting renewable energy sources, investing in energy-efficient technologies, encouraging sustainable consumption patterns, and promoting sustainable financial inclusion could help reduce CO2  emissions in the E-7 countries while also promoting sustainable economic growth and achieving the SDGs goals and COP26 targets. 4.1 Sensitivity test AMG-CCEMG analysis Moreover, there are alternative panel estimators known as AMG-CCEMG to investigate sensitivity findings in Table 5   to confirm the robustness of our findings in Table 4 . Therefore, a similar discussion/interpretation applies.Table 6  .  4.2 Pooled mean group results Finally, since there is a long-run cointegration correlation between the indicators, it is relevant to evaluate their causal link. Using the PMG for this purpose, the causal correlation between the parameters is shown in Fig. 6   for the entire panel, demonstrating both short-run and long-run causation. The single-sided arrow represents unidirectional causation, and the double arrows represent bidirectional causality to environmental deterioration detected in the E-7 economies.   5 Conclusion and policy implications To the best of the authors' knowledge, the long-run and causal effects of digital financial inclusion and energy transition and diversification in achieving SDGs by 2030 and COP26 targets by 2050 with other factors such as energy consumption, technological innovation, economic growth, and foreign direct investment have not been considered comprehensively using newly developed econometric techniques within the seven emerging blocs. This research aims to fill this gap in the sustainable development literature; The study adopted the OLS, quantile regression, AMG-CCEMG for benchmark and sensitivity estimations and PMG for a casualty. Our study found that energy transition, technological innovation, and foreign direct investment can reduce CO2  emissions in the E-7 countries. However, digital financial inclusion, energy consumption, and economic growth are associated with increased CO2  emissions. Furthermore, the AMG-CCEMG approach's results supported the OLS and quantile regression results. Based on the results of the empirical analysis, the policy recommendations can be derived; First, the negative correlation between energy transition and diversification and CO2  emissions suggests that policies aimed at promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, could help reduce CO2  emissions. Second, the negative relationship between technological innovation and CO2  emissions suggests that policies encouraging the development and adoption of energy-efficient technologies could help reduce environmental degradation. Third, attracting FDI in sustainable development projects, such as renewable energy infrastructure or green technology research and development, could help curb CO2 . Fourth, the positive correlation between energy consumption and CO2  emissions suggests that policies promoting sustainable consumption patterns, such as reducing energy consumption in households and businesses, could help mitigate environmental deterioration. Finally, increased access to sustainable finance suggests that policies aimed at increasing access to sustainable finance, such as green bonds or loans for sustainable projects, could help increase environmental sustainability in the E-7 bloc. These policy recommendations should be tailored to the specific contexts and needs of each E-7 country, taking into account their unique economic, social, and environmental factors. It would be important to bring these policy recommendations together in a comprehensive policy framework to address CO2  emissions and promote sustainable development effectively. This could involve a combination of regulatory measures, incentives, and public–private partnerships to promote the adoption of renewable energy sources, encourage technological innovation, attract FDI in sustainable development projects, promote sustainable consumption patterns, manage economic growth, and increase access to sustainable finance. Additionally, it would be important to ensure that these policies are implemented to address any potential social or economic inequalities, such as by providing support for low-income households or workers in industries affected by the transition to renewable energy sources. This could involve retraining programs and support for small and medium-sized enterprises in sustainable industries. Therefore, a comprehensive policy framework that addresses these issues would be essential for reducing CO2  emissions and promoting sustainable development. Although the current study's findings are impressive to achieve the SDGs and COP26 targets; nonetheless, such factors were ignored in the investigation undertaken in this study, and we recommend a future research path in this area; This study examined CO2  as a proxy for environmental deterioration; thus, future studies should use different measurements for environmental deterioration. Furthermore, apart from the E-7 and other emerging economies or this research can be performed for various economies, such as G-7, G-20, OECD, BRICS, etc., that could benefit from this research when formulating their sustainable development objectives. Additionally, in the context of the E-7 bloc, the effects of digital financial inclusion, energy transition and diversification, and other potential indicators on other environmental quality indicators could also be evaluated.
