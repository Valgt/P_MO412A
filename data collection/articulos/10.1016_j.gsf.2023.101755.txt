                  The continuous rise in global environmental challenges has led to urgency toward establishing a secure framework to achieve sustainable development goals. This study establishes a novel theoretical framework to analyze the role of energy prices, energy consumption, gold prices and economic growth on environmental degradation in newly industrialized economies. To realize sustainable development goals and foster environmental defence, this study utilizes CS-ARDL as the main econometric approach to investigate the asymmetric association between environmental degradation and relevant factors. We also use AMG, CS-DL, Driscoll-Kray and FGLS to enhance the robustness of our findings. Our econometric approach reveals that energy resource prices and renewable energy consumption reduce environmental degradation, while gold prices and fossil energy consumption elevate environmental pollutants. We also confirm the existence of the EKC hypothesis. The findings of our extensive analysis paved the way for a well-designed environmental policy for NIC economies should focus on renewable energy consumption, green investments, and structural changes.

Graphical abstract       The continuous rise in global environmental challenges has led to urgency toward establishing a secure framework to achieve sustainable development goals. This study establishes a novel theoretical framework to analyze the role of energy prices, energy consumption, gold prices and economic growth on environmental degradation in newly industrialized economies. To realize sustainable development goals and foster environmental defence, this study utilizes CS-ARDL as the main econometric approach to investigate the asymmetric association between environmental degradation and relevant factors. We also use AMG, CS-DL, Driscoll-Kray and FGLS to enhance the robustness of our findings. Our econometric approach reveals that energy resource prices and renewable energy consumption reduce environmental degradation, while gold prices and fossil energy consumption elevate environmental pollutants. We also confirm the existence of the EKC hypothesis. The findings of our extensive analysis paved the way for a well-designed environmental policy for NIC economies should focus on renewable energy consumption, green investments, and structural changes.   Keywords Gold prices  Fossil fuel costs  Renewable Energy Consumption  Environmental degradation  Newly industrialized countries  COP27    1 Introduction Despite various economic crises, Newly Industrialized1  1 Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey.   economies have taken advantage of natural resources to stimulate the industrial sector, reduce travel costs, create economic opportunities, and modernize domestic economies (Bashir et al., 2021a ). However, this has also initiated discussions about climate change as economic progress has coincided with environmental degradation. The rapid rise in environmental pollutants also poses various environmental, physical, and health consequences, i.e., deforestation, water supply shortages, and warm temperatures (Doğan et al., 2023 ; Bashir, 2022a) . Among these challenges, carbon and greenhouse emissions are the most pertinent challenges to environmental sustainability (Talbi et al., 2022 ; Ma et al., 2023a ), where fossil fuel is the primary component of GHG emissions from transportation, heat, and electricity consumption. Despite their negative impact, emissions from land-use modifications and the manufacturing sector continue to rise (Kemal and Genc, 2020; Siddiqui et al., 2023 ). To overcome climate issues, global leaders ratified environmental commitments to international agreements such as the Paris Agreement to lower GHG emissions and achieve sustainable development (Ma et al., 2023b ). The UN further initiated attempts to integrate global efforts in lowering environmental pollutants and combat global warming (Bashir et al., 2023b ). As emissions from developing economies such as China, Turkey, and India have risen higher than in other geographical regions (Fig. 1  ), policymakers in developing economies have identified renewable energy consumption as a policy alternative to protect environmental sustainability (Fig. 2  ). Consequently, researchers have focused on identifying key factors to elaborate on how renewable energy consumption influences environmental quality, especially in developing economies (Bashir et al., 2020; Essandoh et al., 2020 ). Despite these efforts, studies are yet to accurately determine how natural resources impact environmental sustainability. To overcome, this study attempts to monitor the role of gold and natural resources cost on environmental degradation in NIC economies. We selected these countries due to fossil fuel consumption, the largest producers and consumers of gold and the availability of natural resources. Additionally, overreliance on fossil fuels has meant that these countries are listed with the highest ecological footprints (Sadiq et al., 2022; Bukhari et al., 2023 ). Recent studies on climate change have determined that there is a need for more stringent environmental policy measures to mitigate environmental challlenges including GHG and carbon emissions (Chen et al., 2022 ). Despite adverse environmental implications, global leaders remain fixated on continuing to prefer economic growth over environmental sustainability. As a result, NICs economies have tripled in size due to strong economic growth, which also has been the leading cause of rising GHG emissions. Within this context, we aim to research the impact of the gold price, energy costs, and energy consumption on environmental sustainability. This study is a novel attempt to extensively assess environmental challenges by incorporating gold prices and novel energy resource indicators through novel econometric investigation. Gold is a precious mineral resource that is integral to the global economic system and modern industries. However, its mining, development, and consumption procedures significantly impact environmental quality (Baur and McDermott, 2010; Lei et al., 2022 ). Since NICs economies are among prominent gold exporters, it is of significance to research gold’s interaction with environmental degradation. Moreover, researchers have reported that changes in the cost of resource acquisition have significant implications for fossil importers and exporters as well (Lardic and Mignon, 2006 ). Higher energy costs can be disadvantageous to resource-importing economies but beneficial for resource-exporting economies. As a net importer, any upward shift in fossil fuel prices would put excessive pressure on NICs economies. To keep prices under check, policymakers may hike interest rates, which would deter foreign investments and reduce energy demands and industrial output. The findings of this study will provide information to augment energy and environmental policies in stimulating energy sustainability in NIC economies. Economic growth and industrial transformation remain the priority to boost export revenues but it also endangers environmental sustainability (Shahbaz et al., 2021 ; Bashir et al., 2022a ). Due to the emergence of globalization, environmental implications from any country affect local and international economies (Xia et al., 2022 ). A section of available literature believes that energy resources and industrialization are closely linked as higher energy demand stimulates economic development. However, such economic progress also threatens the environmental sustainability from over-exploitation of natural resources and exacerbates environmental challenges by toxic chemicals and environmental degradation during the mining and consumption processes (Bashir et al., 2023b ). Considering the aforementioned discussion, this study study extends environmental literature; first, the current study is a novel attempt to examine the association between energy resources, gold prices, energy resources, and environmental challenges in NICs economies. Second, we composite novel energy resource and environmental degradation index as we observe that no single energy or environmental pollutant is sufficient to critically analyze environmental sustainability. Third, as gold price has been neglected in natural resource literature, we include it in the empirical strategy to evaluate its role in environmental degradation. Hence, we will provide novel contributions to the current literature. Lastly, we use CS-ARDL, AMG, CS-DL, Driscoll-Kray & FGLS within our econometric strategy to provide extensive statistical evidence from data analysis and novel empirical findings to help NIC policymakers make gradual progress toward environmental sustainability under COP guidelines.  2 Literature review Given its significance and urgency to overcome, environmental degradation is the biggest hurdle for world leaders. Recent environmental literature indicates that industrialization is the root cause and is responsible for more GHG emissions than any other sector of the economy. Shahbaz et al. (2021)  suggested that rational modifications must be considered to reduce the ecological footprint, ensure energy efficiency, and increase the share of tertiary industry in economic growth. Tian et al. (2014)  stressed that stringent environmental policies must be considered to reduce GHG emissions during various stages of industrial activities. This allows us to consider energy consumption, economic growth, gold, and energy resources costs in evaluating environmental quality in NICs economies. 2.1 Environmental degradation and economic growth The first section of the literature review examines environmental degradation from the EKC perspective. According to EKC, economic growth during the initial stage of industrialization exacerbates environmental degradation, while environmental sustainability is possible only after certain thresholds have been achieved (Bashir et al., 2021b ). The environmental implications during initial industrialization can be explained by composition and scale effects (Bashir, 2022b ), while technical effects would explain economic progress in later stages where industrialization does not contribute to environmental degradation as economic activities complement environmental and economic progress. The assumption of the EKC perspective has been confronted by recent literature for its focus on identifying economic progress as the solitary interpreter for environmental degradation. Consequently, Altarhouni et al. (2021)  and Li et al. (2023)  have attempted to identify key macroeconomic indicators which affect energy transition and environmental sustainability. A plethora of available environmental literature has researched EKC hypothesis to study the role of economic growth in climate change; however, diverse findings mean that a definite conclusion is yet to be determined. Koc & Bulus (2020)  invalidated the EKC hypothesis after investigating GHG emissions from industrialization in emerging economies. The researchers summarized that the curved N-shaped curve means that industrialization lowers GHG emissions but increases it further during later stages. Rahman et al. (2021)  conducted a cross-country analysis to report the absence of the EKC hypothesis for emerging countries. On the other hand, Ali et al. (2020)  contradicted these findings by verifying the EKC hypothesis for the region of South Asia. Dong et al. (2017)  and Sapkota & Bastola (2017)  confirmed the EKC hypothesis for the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. Additionally, some researchers have revealed that economic growth is the cause of environmental degradation (Bashir et al., 2022c ; Yan et al., 2022 ).  2.2 Environmental degradation and energy consumption Prioritizing higher renewable energy consumption remains key as global leaders aim to substitute fossil fuel consumption with RE to improve environmental footprint and energy efficiency. Under recent energy policies, ASEAN, EU, and Bulgaria have aimed to increase RE consumption by 23%, 27%, and 16%, respectively (Ma et al., 2022 ). Continuous energy supply is key in industrial progress as higher energy consumption correlates with economic progress (Mehrara, 2007 ). However, this also has environmental implications as energy resources emit GHG emissions to deteriorate environmental quality (Doğan et al., 2023 ). Siddiqui et al. (2023)  reviewed sustainable development goals to suggest that RE consumption must be prioritized in replacing fossil fuels and lessen environmental degradation. Ma et al. (2023c)  and Halicioglu (2009)  researched aggregate energy consumption for Malaysia and Pakistan to conclude that continued dependence on fossil fuels exacerbates environmental degradation and GHG emissions. Acheampong (2018)  analyzed energy consumption in the MENA region to stipulate that NRE worsens environmental quality. Chen et al. (2019)  supported these findings to indicate that countries with the highest share of RE in the energy mix can achieve environmental sustainability while countries with fossil fuels reliance face higher GHG emissions and climate change issues. Bashir et al. (2022d)  investigated economic development in emerging economies to suggest that the gradual replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy ensures environmental sustainability.  2.3 Environmental degradation and energy resource prices Due to their transitionary stage towards industrialization, NICs are one of the biggest consumers of fossil fuels. This also means these countries have emitted enormous GHG emissions in recent years. Due to continued dependence on fossil fuels, any volatility in energy prices affects economic growth as well (Uzar, 2020 ). Katircioglu (2017)  analyzed oil price fluctuations in Turkey to report that high oil prices have negative implications for economic growth but also correlate negatively with carbon emissions. Zou (2018)  researched fossil fuels, economic growth and environmental quality to reveal that price changes in fossil energy significantly affect environmental pollutants and economic growth, but such effects are minimal in the long run. Mensah et al. (2019)  analyzed carbon emissions trends to suggest that any increment in energy prices reduces GHG emissions. Malik et al. (2020)  contradicted these studies by analyzing econometric data from 1971 to 2014 through ARDL to reveal that an increase in fossil fuels exacerbates environmental degradation. Mahmood & Furqan (2021)  analyzed selected Gulf economies to suggest that energy prices had negative implications for energy exports but were positively associated with environmental sustainability. In a recent study,  Bashir (2022b)  analyzed carbon emission, energy consumption, and energy price change in the context of Turkey to reveal that higher fossil fuel costs significantly lower carbon emissions. Likewise, Mujtaba & Jena (2021)  reported similar statistical findings for the case of India as an increase in energy costs results in environmental sustainability (Bashir et al., 2021c ).  2.4 Environmental degradation and gold prices The availability of natural resources (like gold) is a valuable economic instrument that can boost economic activities (Liu et al., 2022 ). However, further research is required to determine how natural resources impact environmental quality and economic growth (Bashir, 2022b ). Generally, the industrial sector is considered an integral component of macroeconomic growth, and any expansion within industrial policy requires significant volumes of natural resource consumption. While acceleration in industrial output boosts economic activities and export revenues, it also causes resource depletion, higher GHG emissions, and contributes to environmental degradation from trash (Li et al., 2023 ). Recent studies have discussed the significance of gold within natural resource literature. Baur & McDermott (2010)  observed negative gold returns are closely monitored with economic instability in developing economies. Gyamfi et al. (2021)  investigated natural resource trade in G7 economies from 1990 to 2016. The study used DOLS, FMOLS, AMG, and quantile regression as econometric strategies to conclude that natural resources endanger environmental sustainability. Ling et al. (2022)  and Wang et al. (2020)  reported similar association between GHG emissions and natural resources by concluding that natural resource trade is key to economic development but also poses environmental challenges. Lastly, Bashir et al. (2021d)  reviewed the nexus between environmental quality and natural resource depletion in one belt one road economies to determine that natural resources negatively affect sustainable development in developing economies.   3 Methodology 3.1 Model and data sources This study has selected NIC economies to investigate how energy prices, gold prices, economic growth and energy consumption impact environmental degradation. Our basic econometric investigation is expressed as Eq. (1) :(1) ENV = f ( E R P , G P , R E N , N R E N , G D P )     Where, ENV = environmental degradation, FP = energy prices, GP = gold prices, REN = RE energy consumption, NREN = energy generated from fossil fuels and GDP = economic growth. To provide statistically accurate findings, we converted the empirical dataset in logarithmic form to overcome data dispersion and heteroskedasticity. Tables 1 and 2    provide basic statistical information.  3.2 Variables construction We also investigate the empirical association between energy prices, gold prices, renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, and economic growth on environmental degradation for NIC nations in this study (Fig. 3  ). The data for GDP is taken as GDP per capita (constant 2017 US$), GP is represented by the trading cost of gold in the international market, RE is the proportion of renewable energy consumption out of total energy consumption, and NRE is the net non-renewable energy consumption. The composite index of energy resource prices constitutes natural gas, coal, and oil prices. The novel composite index of environmental degradation constitutes five major environmental pollutants: N2 O, CO2 , CH4 , PM2.5 , and GHG emissions. Consequently, the above-mentioned composite variables can be expressed as Eqs. (2) and (3) :(2) ln ERP  it   = α 0 i t   + α 1 i t   Coal  2 i t   + α 2 i t   NG  3 i t   + α 2 i t   Oil  4 i t   + ε it       (3) ln ENV  it   = α 0 i t   + α 1 i t   CO  2 i t   + α 2 i t   CH  4 i t   + α 3  N 2 O  it   + β 4  P M 2.5  it   + β 5 i t   GHGO  it   + ε it       By integrating Eq. (1)  with composite indexes of ERP and ENV, we determine the testable econometric approach as Eq. (4) :(4) ln ENV  it   = β 1  l n ERP  it   + β 2  lnGP  it   + β 3  l n REC  it   + β 4  l n NREC  it   + β 5  GDP  it   + ε it       The inclusion of the EKC hypothesis in equation (4)  can be summarized as Eq. (5) :(5) ln ENV  it   = β 1  l n ERP  it   + β 2  lnGP  it   + β 3  l n REC  it   + β 4  l n NREC  it   + β 5  GDP  it   + β 6  GDP  it  2  + ε it         3.3 Econometric strategy 3.3.1 Preliminary tests We begin our empirical strategy (Fig. 4  ) by testing CSD in the observed dataset. The CSD exists due to economic and social integration, globalization, undefined residual dependency, and unknown common shocks. Also, the CSD estimation helps identify any unwarranted mutual shocks (Bashir et al., 2023a ). An accurate CSD estimation makes empirical findings efficient and consistent and eliminates spurious and biased parameters. We rely on Pesaran CSD, Bias-corrected scaled LM, Pesaran scaled LM, and Breusch-Pagan LM tests to check the existence of CSD. In addition, identifying slope heterogeneity is important as econometric weights for each panel are different. The current study uses Pesaran and Yamagata (2008)  for slope heterogeneity to evaluate the spread of each panel’s weighted slope. The following Eqs. (6) and (7)  provide an econometric form:(6) Δ ∼  SH   = N   N  - 1   S % - k  2 k           (7) Δ ∼  adj   = N   N  - 1   S % - k  2 k ( T - k - 1 )  T + 1             Δ ∼  SH      and Δ ∼  adj      represent delta tilde and adjusted the delta tilde, respectively. Next, we use CIPS and CADF unit root tests to reveal the unit root properties of the dataset. We chose second-generation tests as these tests can overcome the presence of CSD and slope homogeneity in the empirical dataset. Additionally, CIPS and CADF are more reliable and accurate than first-generation tests, which produce unproductive statistics. The CIPS test evaluates CSD by considering the averages of each cross-section, while CADF test determines the outcome of stationary tests for each cross-section unit by assuming that the time effect influences each cross-section. Identifying cointegration correlation is important to conclude whether data variables have a long-term association. Moreover, the presence of cointegration allows policymakers to take appropriate measures to help formulate long-term policies and regulations. For this, we have used Westerlund (2007)  as it operates well within structural breaks and small datasets.  3.3.2 Estimation of long-run empirical coefficients As the next step in empirical estimation, the current study evaluates the cointegration vector to analyze the association between ENV and independent variables. Most current studies have used FMOLS, DOLS or ARDL, assuming that data cross-sections are independent. However, we challenge this assumption as factors like ENV, or error terms could influence trade in cross-sections, and unobserved common factors can influence the empirical outcomes and lead to biased estimates. Due to this, we use CS-ARDL (Bashir et al., 2023b ) regression as Eq. (8) :(8) Δ E F P  i , t   = φ i  + ∑ j = 1  p  φ it   Δ E F P  i , t - j   + ∑ j = 0  p  φ ij  ′  AEV  i , t - j   + ∑ j = 0  p  φ ij  ′  Z  ¯   t - j   + ε i , t       Z  ¯      and AEV    represent cross-section averages and independent variables. This research also uses AMG, CS-DL, Driscoll-Kray & FGLS as robustness checks to cross-examine findings from CS-ARDL. The selection of AMG and CS-DL is important as these approaches efficiently overcome endogeneity, CSD heterogeneity, endogeneity, and non-stationarity. Additionally, these approaches are robust to deal with correlation in cross-sections. Next, we use Driscoll Kray with our rationale that it produces statistical findings that are robust to spatial and temporal dependence. Lastly, we apply FGLS as a robustness check as this methodology considers CSD/correlation, auto-correlation within panels, and heteroskedasticity across panels. We conclude our investigation by using DH causality tests to estimate the existence of causal association within the dataset. Our rationale is that this approach is efficient if N < T and if error terms are CSD-dependent.    4 Empirical findings In the initial stage of econometric analysis, we evaluate CSD and slope heterogeneity, followed by cointegration among data variables. The emergence of globalization and international trade agreements means that global economies are highly integrated, and economic shocks in one can impact other countries. The findings reported in Table 3   confirm CSD. We also use Pesaran and Yamagata (2008)  cointegration test to determine slope heterogeneity in the empirical dataset. Table 4   concludes that delta and adj. delta are significant at 1, confirming that additional tests must be conducted to overcome slope heterogeneity. The existence of CSD and slope heterogeneity determine the need to check unit root properties. For the current study, we use CIPS and CADF unit root tests as these tests are more robust than first-generation tests and provide accurate empirical findings. The findings reported in Table 5   show that data is significant at the first difference and reject non-stationary. Next, we determine the long-term association between environmental degradation, energy prices, gold prices, economic growth, and energy consumption. The findings reported in Table 6   help us determine that all variables are under consideration and co-integrated, allowing us to proceed with a long-run econometric strategy. We chose CS-ARDL as the lead long-run econometric analysis to determine the empirical association between environmental degradation, energy prices, gold prices, economic progress, and energy consumption for newly industrialized economies from 1995 to 2021. First, our estimates for energy prices are negative and significant to show that higher energy prices will have a negative impact on the degree of environmental degradation (Bashir et al., 2022b ). As NICs depend on fossil fuels for industrial needs, this negative impact allows us to determine that any negative change in energy prices will lower fossil fuel demands and reduce environmental challenges. Moreover, this also affects renewable energy consumption, further lowering GHG emissions (Bukhari et al., 2023; Sadiq et al., 2022 ). However, due to the nature of energy demands, any decrease in energy costs would likely cause fossil fuel consumption to degrade environmental quality. Our findings have support from (Bashir et al., 2023a; Katircioglu, 2017; Ma et al., 2023b; Mujtaba and Jena, 2021 ) in recent literature. Next, the association between gold prices and ENV is significant and positive, meaning any increase in gold prices would increase environmental degradation and GHG emissions. This can be attributed to energy consumption during mining, production, and manufacturing processes. Furthermore, as gold requires several materials during the final production process, these materials and energy requirements are key influencers in environmental degradation from the gold industry. Several recent studies by Saadaoui and Chtourou (2022) , Bashir et al. (2022d) , Ling et al. (2022), Du et al. (2021)  have reported similar findings for natural resources. The association between REN and environmental degradation is negative and statistically significant, meaning that renewable energy consumption helps overcome environmental challenges. The gradual environmental reforms and their integration with sustainable development goals have been critical in achieving these outcomes. Moreover, the NREN has a positive and significant association with environmental degradation due to the share of fossil energy within the energy mix and the continued reliance on fossil energy resources. Despite environmental reforms, rapid industrialization and economic growth mean that NICs have a significantly higher ecological footprint, and energy transition must be prioritized to first decrease and eventually overcome environmental challenges. Recent publications by Jin and Kim (2018), Doğan et al. (2023) , Bashir et al. (2023a)  and Zhang and Chiu (2020)  also reported similar findings to suggest that renewable energy protocols must be implemented to achieve carbon neutrality. Lastly, the statistical findings related to GDP are positive, while GDP2  negatively correlates with environmental degradation. This validates the EKC hypothesis for NICs and indicates that economic growth during initial developmental stages degrades environmental quality due to material and resource consumption (Talbi et al., 2022 ). However, environmental pollution decreases after certain thresholds have been achieved as higher per capita income and education significantly create general awareness and consciousness about environmental issues and sustainable development (Bashir et al., 2022d ). Our findings are in line with, Banday and Aneja (2020), Mensah et al. (2019) , Ma et al. (2023c) , and Koc and Bulus (2020) , who also reported the findings to confirm the EKC hypothesis between environmental degradation and economic output. Table 7   also provides long-run empirical findings similar to short-run outcomes, which report similar outcomes to long-run findings. Moreover, we use Fig. 5   to provide a graphical summary of econometric results. We extend the empirical analysis by cross-examining CS-ARDL through AMG, CS-DL, Driscoll-Kray & FGLS (Table 8  ). The coefficient values from the AMG estimator for ERP, GOLD, REN, NREN, GDP, and GDP2  are –0.299, 0.339, –0.061, 0.438, 1.587 and –1.878, with estimates significant at different statistical levels. Moreover, the findings from CS-DL, Driscoll-Kray & FGLS also report similar estimates. Our analysis of robustness checks supports CS-ARDL findings and the confirmation of the EKC hypothesis for NICs economies. Overall, our review of the econometric strategy insists that NICs have shown great resilience in the environmental agenda to overcome ecological challenges and use renewable energy resources to make timely progress towards net-zero carbon emissions. Lastly, these robust analytical findings allow us to provide novel policy suggestions to improve environmental quality in NICs. Lastly, we conclude our empirical analysis by analyzing the causal association between environmental degradation, energy resource prices, gold prices, economic growth and energy consumption (Table 9  ). ENV reports bidirectional causal association with all variables except GDP. ERP has a dual causality with ENV, a unilateral causal association with GOLD, NREN & GDP, but no causal association with REN. GOLD has bidirectional causality with all except REN, with whom it shares unilateral causal association. REN has a bidirectional causality association with ENV and NREN. Furthermore, NREN has bidirectional causality with all indicators except ERP. Lastly, GDP has bidirectional causality with ENV, GOLD, and NREN, while unilateral causality with REN and ERP.  5 Conclusions and policy implications The current study examines environmental progress by exploring the nexus between energy resource prices, gold prices, energy consumption, economic growth and environmental degradation for NIC economies of 1995–2021. We have used CS-ARDL, AMG, CS-DL, Driscoll-Kray & FGLS as the econometric strategy. We extend the energy economics discussion by formulating novel energy resource and environmental degradation indexes. We fill the gaps in the current literature by (i) confirming CSD and slope heterogeneity; (ii) CIPS & CADF and Westerlund tests report unit root and long-term association amongst data variables; (iii) energy resources prices and renewable energy prevent environmental degradation, while economic progress, non-renewable energy and gold prices degrade environmental quality; (iv) we also confirm the existence of EKC hypothesis for NICs; (v) DH causality analysis confirmed unilateral and bidirectional causal association among data indicators. Our findings report that renewable energy consumption and higher energy resource costs significantly negatively influence environmental degradation. These findings support recent research to use energy alternatives in preserving environmental quality. NICs are highly dependent on fossil fuel imports as these economies import more than 50% of energy resources consumed by industrial and residential sectors. Due to this, any economic and environmental performance is significantly influenced by variations in fossil fuel costs. Hence, we encourage policy changes to reduce energy imports and prevent unwarranted shocks in the domestic economy. This allows us to suggest that fossil imports must be gradually substituted with renewable and green energy supply to overcome fuel price instabilities. In addition, we report a positive association between economic growth, non-renewable energy consumption, and gold prices on environmental quality. Mining minerals such as gold requires huge energy resources, contributing to environmental degradation. NICs such as Thailand and India are the biggest consumers of gold, while South Africa is one of the largest gold exporters. Environmental contamination during extraction, processing during consumer sales, and use of energy-intensive technologies affect ecological sustainability. Economic policies also influence environmental performance, as trade openness and industrialization have led to higher energy demands and a rise in GHG emissions. Hence, we urge the policymakers to introduce resource conservation policies to closely monitor resource extraction, prohibit energy-intensive technologies, and mandate a fixed proportion of renewable energy to be consumed in production processes. Another policy suggestion is to increase the R&D budget to develop energy-efficient technologies to minimize ecological threats. Our extensive econometric analysis allows us to propose several policy suggestions to guide policymakers in instituting environmental initiatives. As fossil energy resources and economic growth are the main drivers of environmental degradation, we propose that NICs must integrate green policies with innovative and energy-efficient technologies to balance SDG progress and mitigate environmental challenges. Another policy suggestion is to focus on using green tax laws to limit non-renewable energy consumption in mining natural resources to limit environmental concerns during extraction procedures. Furthermore, as natural resource operations, i.e., gold, endanger environmental sustainability, any upward price change pushes mining operations to mine as much as possible. Hence, we suggest stringent resource extraction laws to ensure these firms operate without endangering environmental quality. Finally, policymakers need to consider the role of human capital and technological innovation in environmental policies to explore novel policy solutions within the energy-environment nexus. Despite offering novel empirical findings and policy discussion, the current study has shortcomings that future studies can overcome. First, the current study is limited to NICs economies. We encourage researchers to determine country-specific or inter-regional analyses to identify differences in economic and geopolitical regions. Further research into the BRICST, G20, or ASEAN regions will offer essential insights into the environmental discussion. This will also undoubtedly contribute invaluable statistical evidence to evaluate the impact of policy ramifications within environmental sustainability in the future.
