                  Introduction
                  Current lengthening of average life and constant increase of population ageing associated to forces that include rapid unplanned urbanisation and globalisation of unhealthy behaviours have determined the huge relevance of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Monitoring key modifiable behavioural risk factors has resulted to be crucial both in spatial terms and as per temporal trends in order to allow comparisons between different geographic areas or levels and over time.
               
                  Materials and Methods
                  In Italy, PASSI (Progressi delle Aziende Sanitarie per la Salute in Italia) and Passi d’Argento are the ongoing Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance Systems (BRFSSs), respectively, on adults (people aged 18−69) and elderly (65 and older).
               
                  Results
                  The two Italian surveillances are information systems providing data not only on the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) that explicitly addresses ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, but on a total of nine health-related SDGs (HRSDGs) and 19 HRSDG targets/indicators. We describe these pairs more in detail specifying where in case of BRFSS core indicators (N = 14 HRSDG targets/indicators) concerning six HRSDGs or, on the other hand, as per BRFSS further in-depth analysis (N = five HRSDG targets/indicators) in regard of four different HRSDGs. About the HRSDG 3, HRSDG target 3.4, HRSDG indicator 3.4.1, from the PASSI and Passi d’Argento data it is possible not only to detect the prevalence of NCDs in adults and elderly living in Italy, but also to evaluate the social determinants of health, such as gender, age group, educational level, economic difficulties, as well as the associations with modifiable lifestyle risk factors.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The two Italian BRFSSs generate accurate data, which are highly relevant to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate programs and policies at different levels (local, regional, national) for NCD prevention and health promotion. They provide numbers which can also serve as propaedeutic or, in some cases, complementary ground to address a robust measurement of several HRSDG patterns.

Materials and Methods In Italy, PASSI (Progressi delle Aziende Sanitarie per la Salute in Italia) and Passi d’Argento are the ongoing Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance Systems (BRFSSs), respectively, on adults (people aged 18−69) and elderly (65 and older).  Results The two Italian surveillances are information systems providing data not only on the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) that explicitly addresses ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, but on a total of nine health-related SDGs (HRSDGs) and 19 HRSDG targets/indicators. We describe these pairs more in detail specifying where in case of BRFSS core indicators (N = 14 HRSDG targets/indicators) concerning six HRSDGs or, on the other hand, as per BRFSS further in-depth analysis (N = five HRSDG targets/indicators) in regard of four different HRSDGs. About the HRSDG 3, HRSDG target 3.4, HRSDG indicator 3.4.1, from the PASSI and Passi d’Argento data it is possible not only to detect the prevalence of NCDs in adults and elderly living in Italy, but also to evaluate the social determinants of health, such as gender, age group, educational level, economic difficulties, as well as the associations with modifiable lifestyle risk factors.  Conclusions The two Italian BRFSSs generate accurate data, which are highly relevant to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate programs and policies at different levels (local, regional, national) for NCD prevention and health promotion. They provide numbers which can also serve as propaedeutic or, in some cases, complementary ground to address a robust measurement of several HRSDG patterns.

In 2016, NCDs were responsible for 71 % of the world’s 57 million deaths, killing more than 41 million people in one year [4 ]. Beside mortality rates, this group of disease impacts on other relevant public health indicators globally, such as morbidity, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLL), global burden of disease (GBD) [5 ]. Under such scenario, monitoring key modifiable behavioural risk factors has resulted to be crucial both in spatial terms and as per temporal trends in order to allow comparisons between different geographic areas or levels and over time [6–9 ]. The targets for the NCD global control were afterwards aligned to those included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted at the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2015, identifying 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [10 ,11 ]. In more recent years, further studies have been developed to understand achievements attained [12 ,13 ], and 12 goals, 33 targets and 57 indicators have been defined as health-related SDGs (HRSDGs) [14 ]. In Italy, PASSI (Progressi delle Aziende Sanitarie per la Salute in Italia) [15 ] and Passi d’Argento [16 ] are the ongoing Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance Systems (BRFSSs) [17 ], respectively, on adults (people aged 18−69) and elderly (65 and older). Based on the international model of the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) [18 ] and committed by the Italian Ministry of Health, they both are officially recognised as per the Decree of the Prime Minister’s Office on Registries and Surveillances, March 2017, 3rd  [19 ]. The National Institute of Health in Italy (namely, Istituto Superiore di Sanità – ISS) is in charge of their coordination at state level, but the operational centres are the Local Health Authorities (LHAs) where, each month, specially trained healthcare workers interview representative samples of resident population [20 ,21 ]. As PASSI and Passi d’Argento stand for actual and factual data population-based sources in Italy, they run the main action lines for public health, which are the three “As”: Analysis, Advocacy, Action. It means that the two systems contribute in matter of: delivering scientific analysis , fostering advocacy  to policies, supporting action  and interventions in public health [22 ]. A fortiori, in time of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the novel coronavirus disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is even more appropriate to highlight the importance of PASSI and Passi d’Argento as surveillances providing prompt information on several HRSDG indicators in population aged 18+ living in Italy [23 ].  2 Materials and methods 2.1 BRFSS sampling procedures and data collection In the PASSI and Passi d’Argento frameworks, if the base for data collection is the Local Health Unit (LHU), actions as training or data quality monitoring, analysis and dissemination are centrally supervised. In the LHUs participating in the two surveillances, monthly samples are extracted by a random modality from an enrolment list of residents and stratified by gender and age group in the same proportion than the reference target population (adult for PASSI, elderly for Passi d’Argento). The size of each stratum is proportional to the demographic composition of the local population. Specially trained LHU personnel, public health practitioners and assistants, administer telephone interviews through standardised and yearly revised questionnaires. Besides being resident in Italy and within the target age range (18–69 years in PASSI, ≥65 years in Passi d’Argento), criteria for eligibility are to be: reachable on a telephone number (landline or mobile), not hospitalised nor institutionalised (long-term care, nursing home, prison), able to understand the Italian language and to participate in the interview [24 ,25 ]. Both the operational protocols encompass the field substitution technique [26 ].  2.2 BRFSS statistical analysis Once data are collected, they are anonymised, encrypted and electronically recorded in a common national database [27 ], and an annual dataset is created by aggregation of the interviews finalised from January to December. After the calendar year dataset is closed and within the first months of the following year, data cleaning procedures and following elaborations are run by the national coordinating centre at ISS. Furthermore, multiyear datasets are combined to ensure adequate sample size for allowing population subgroups explorations. Prevalence estimates (at regional and national level) are weighted by assigning each record a probability weight equal to the inverse of the sampling fraction in each LHU stratum. Complex survey design analyses are conducted; all percentages report 95 % confidence intervals (CI95 %) [24 ,25 ].  2.3 BRFSS main characteristics The Table 1   lists the features characterising the two systems, for which both age and sex distributions of the samples closely reflect those of the resident reference population for the years and geographical areas considered. People aged 18−69 years old and over65 living in Italy comprised, respectively, nearly 41 million and about 14 million individuals on 1 January 2017 [28 ]. Two pilot PASSI studies were carried out in 2005 and 2006 before the implementation as surveillance system since 2008; Passi d’Argento was activated some years later, as study in 2012 and got up to speed in 2016. The Lombardy Region contributed to the PASSI pool with the sample from the LHUs of Milan City, Bergamo, Pavia and Varese, in the years 2015−2016. Within the period 2015−2018, in PASSI 133,070 people (almost 90 % of adult population overall) were interviewed in more than 90 % LHUs (89 out of 101 in 2018). The outcome rates are calculated according to the guidelines of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) [29 ] and, in 2018, the response rate is 80 %, the refusal rate 10 % and the eligibility rate 91 %. In the years 2016−2018, in Passi d’Argento all LHAs except Lombardy and Valle d’Aosta participated. An amount of 40,681 records has been collected, with a response rate of 87 %, refusal rate 10 % and the eligibility rate was 97 % (2018).  2.4 BRFSS data visualisation Data gathered locally are then elaborated nationwide to detect and understand how major public health indicators change in the population according to the main sociodemographic characteristics, over time and in the space, so far results per the regional and national levels as well as temporal trends are promptly produced and displayed on each system-related web pages hosted by the EpiCentro portal [30 ,31 ]. Besides the abundance of data, PASSI and Passi d’Argento bring information on the following sociodemographic characteristics: sex, age, educational level (none or primary school, middle school, high school, university), economic difficulties in making ends meet by the available financial resources (many, some or not at all), nationality (Italian or other) and geographic residence area as categorised by the National Institute of Statistics criteria (North, Centre, South and major islands). Different data visualisation types are delivered: indicator results (prevalence) at glance coloured as depending on if LHA values are better, similar or worse than the national percentages; a profile in tabular form reporting prevalence and CI95 %, and in detail distributions by pie charts and/or horizontal bar histograms. Surveillances allow also the elaboration of geographic comparisons and temporal trends: maps where the LHA territories are coloured as done for indicators described above, coupled with horizontal bar histograms reporting prevalence and CI95 %, and in PASSI that can rely on an 11 year-old closed dataset so far, historical series are released.  2.5 BRFSS data informing HRSDGs The two Italian BRFSSs include many variables measuring health outcomes or determinants of health, even providing information beyond the SDG 3 that explicitly addresses ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all. PASSI and Passi d’Argento as population-based surveillances actually produce a plenty of prevalence for HRSDG indicators that have their own scope within the direct or stewardship functions of the health system in delivering interventions or reducing risks to health. Thus, as the BRFSS reason for being is to supply updated evidence which can inform public health policies and lead to effective disease prevention and health promotion actions, several issues fully match with HRSDGs that either are or directly relate to health outcomes and risks, services and interventions, or health needs and capacities.   3 Results 3.1 Description of BRFSS indicators corresponding with HRSDGs Overall, PASSI and Passi d’Argento are information systems providing data on a total of nine HRSDGs and 19 HRSDG targets/indicators. We describe these pairs more in detail specifying on the one hand where in case of BRFSS core indicators (N = 14 HRSDG targets/indicators) concerning six HRSDGs or, on the other hand, as per BRFSS further in-depth analysis (N = five HRSDG targets/indicators) in regard of four different HRSDGs. 3.1.1 BRFSS core indicators corresponding with HRSDGs The Table 2   shows the first group of BRFSS indicators, routinely generated, matching with HRSDGs and their own targets. For each variable, we indicate corresponding HRSDG, HRSDG target, HRSDG indicator in the brackets. The BRFSS core indicators which the both systems have in common are: proportion of men and women living with economic difficulties in making ends meet by the available financial resources (1: 1.2, 1.2.2); prevalence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease (3: 3.4, 3.4.1); different modes of alcohol consumption, such as usual, binge, heavy, between meals, at-risk drinking (3: 3.5, 3.5.2); prevalence of current tobacco use (3: 3.a, 3.a.1); advice on modifiable lifestyle risk factors by healthcare workers (3: 3.c, 3.c.1); parity indices for educational level, e.g., female/male, many/none economic difficulties (4: 4.5, 4.5.1); socioeconomic inequalities (10: 10.2, 10.2.1); uptake of vaccination against seasonal influenza (3: 3.b, 3.b.1). In PASSI, data are available also on rubella vaccination in women aged 18−49 (3: 3.b, 3.b.1) and on use of personal protective equipment for road safety (3: 3.6, 3.6.1). Passi d’Argento includes provision of information on other five HRSDGs and associated targets/indicators: access to essential services (3: 3.8, 3.8.1); proportion of individuals living in households with at least one housing problem (1: 1.4, 1.4.1); participation rate in formal and non-formal education and training in the previous 12 months (4: 4.3, 4.3.1); proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location (5: 5.4, 5.4.1); neighbourhood security (16: 16.1, 16.1.4).  3.1.2 BRFSS further indicators corresponding with HRSDGs The Table 3   shows the second group of BRFSS indicators, due to further analysis and/or extraordinary investigation, matching with HRSDGs and their own targets. These variables are on population aged 18−69 because gathered in PASSI only: employment and working conditions by migrant status (8: 8.8, 8.8.1); active mobility and environmental risk perception (11: 11.2, 11.2.1); urban health, physical activity and green spaces (11: 11.7, 11.7.1); 2009−2010 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2009 L’Aquila earthquake (3: 3.d, 3.d.1; 17: 17.19, 17.19.2c).   3.2 An outstanding example: chronic diseases in population aged 18+ living in Italy With regard to the HRSDG 3, HRSDG target 3.4, HRSDG indicator 3.4.1, and summing up data from PASSI and Passi d’Argento on prevalence of chronic disease, we can draw the big picture on these conditions in population aged 18 years and older in Italy. In PASSI and Passi d’Argento, NCDs are identified by asking the interviewees if a physician has ever diagnosed or confirmed at least one of the following to them: myocardial infarction, cardiac ischaemia or coronary disease, other heart diseases such as heart failure or valvulopathy, stroke or cerebral ischaemia; cancer (including leukaemia and lymphomas); diabetes; chronic bronchitis, emphysema, respiratory failure, bronchial asthma; chronic liver disease, cirrhosis; kidney failure. Hypertension is investigated among reported diagnosis for cardiovascular risk, not considered within estimation of people suffering from chronic diseases and comorbidities. As the Fig. 1   shows, 6% of adults living in Italy suffer from chronic respiratory disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disease represent the second major NCD group with a prevalence of 4% each, cancer follows with 3%, lastly the same percentage of 1% is retrieved for the other chronic diseases (liver, kidney, stroke). Hypertension as cardiovascular risk reaches 17 %. The Fig. 2   reports the NCD distribution in the elderly: 28 % cardiovascular disease, the same prevalence for chronic respiratory disease and diabetes (20 %), cancer follows with 13 %, stroke and kidney failure 8% each, chronic liver diseases 4%. Hypertension among over65 is very high, reaching 60 %. The percentages at the Fig. 3   indicate that in the population aged 18 and older there is not difference between men and women: neither in the case of one chronic disease (12 % vs. 13 %) nor for two or more NCDs (3% in both genders). Looking at the Fig. 4  , it is clear that the increase of burden due to chronic diseases occur in the older age. In the two subgroups 18−49 and 50–64, respectively, 10 % and 26 % are affected by chronic disease. In the three older subpopulations (65–74, 75–84, 85+), we observe higher prevalence for one chronic disease (35 %, 36 %, 35 %) as well as of two and more NCDs (19 %, 30 %, 37 %). The Fig. 5   illustrates to what extent the major modifiable lifestyle risk factors vary by gender in chronic adult patients in Italy. The greater gaps between men and women are detected on two factors: tobacco smoking, given that current smokers are, respectively, 30 % vs. 22 % and former smokers (22 % vs. 13 %), and physical inactivity, with a disadvantaged gradient for women (25 % vs. 32 %). On the contrary, obesity is similar in both genders, 11 % vs. 10 %.   4 Discussion and conclusions 4.1 Study results The two Italian BRFSSs PASSI and Passi d’Argento offer broad information on HRSDGs, by routine and further variables. The larger group of indicators concern either health outcomes, as NCD prevalence including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease, health professional advice received on correct lifestyles and access to essential services, or social determinants of health as per gender driver, educational level, socioeconomic inequalities, neighbourhood security. The other indicators refer to information needs and crosscutting issues focusing on special topics, so far occupational health in migrants or interesting context-based population profile, for instance urban health communities, or raised concomitantly with extemporary events, as emergency modules which were appositely designed and released for the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic [32 ] or in 2009 after the earthquake in L’Aquila [33 ]. Among all the indicators described above, we deal specifically with the focus on chronic diseases that gains even further relevance in the current scenario of PHEIC in Italy that is being one of the Countries mostly affected by COVID-19. Surveillance data on this HRSDG indicator give an overview on chronicity and comorbidities which worsen significantly with ageing, identifying individuals reaching a quite long life, but not with a satisfactory quality overall. We know in fact that in Italy, despite an average life expectancy over the age of 80, nearly 20 years are lived in a poor health status, 10 of which with disability [34 ]. The findings from PASSI and Passi d’Argento indicate that older people are twice or thrice as likely to suffer from NCDs in comparison to adults, and the fatal cases from COVID-19 in Italy appear to reflect that distribution [35 ]. Beside the vulnerability in general for people, and even to specific subpopulations in terms of disease itself, the burden of chronic disease poses a great challenge for the healthcare demand first, till the economic and social costs which continue rising constantly.  4.2 Implications of using surveillance data for research on HRSGDs The logic model grounding BRFSSs, as PASSI and Passi d’Argento are, mainly aims at translating information into action [18 ]. However, they stand for uniquely powerful tools in public health which can also orient several research lines. Indeed, surveillance data return a wide-ranged health profile, going from quality of life and life satisfaction (unhealthy days), mental well-being (depressive symptoms screened by the Patient Health Questionnaire 2, PHQ-2) [36 ], to modifiable lifestyle risk factors, compliance with preventive programs, and the amount of health professional advice on correct habit promotion. Frailty and disability are two additional investigation areas in elderly, using the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, ADL [37 ], and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, IADL, assessment [38 ]. Passi d’Argento variables recall in fact the three pillars supporting the “Active and Healthy Aging” framework (Health, Participation, Security) [25 ].  4.3 Strengths and limitations PASSI and Passi d’Argento rely on large sample size and proven reliability and validity but, differently from other surveillance systems, they do not refer to any European network, thus comparisons with other Countries is not possible so far. As per any interview-based health survey, surveillance data (except for the main demographic characteristics: sex, age, residence) are self-reported and cannot be validated with objective measures. It means that the information released can be somehow biased, generating underestimated or overestimated percentages [39 ]. Modifiable lifestyle risk factors may be affected by bias for social desirability, because socially undesirable behaviours are prone to underestimation, and misclassification or recall bias could occur on compliance with preventive programs, as referring to unusual and infrequent behaviour. Self-reported data show in any way robust consistency and sensitivity, and their use is extremely important within public health resource allocation [40 ], even because the PASSI and Passi d’Argento interviewers are specially trained healthcare workers from the LHU Prevention Departments and, over the years, a capillary surveillance network has been growing on local territory [24 ,25 ]. Furthermore, because nonrespondents often differ from who participates in the interview for characteristics under consideration, high nonresponse rates can lead to inaccurate measures of the indicators. There is no general consensus about which value are acceptable, because the alteration of the estimates depends on many factors, such as survey design, study population, reasons for nonresponse, explored variables, and others [41 ]. However, in PASSI and in Passi d’Argento, the sample is extracted from LHU lists of residents and both landline and mobile phones are used for the interviews, so that a much broader coverage than other similar surveys (e.g., the American BRFSS) is achieved and the final response rate is goodly assessed [26 ].  4.4 Implications for practice Since the very beginning, the Italian population-based surveillance systems have included result communication within their objectives [42 ]. The relevance of information gathered by the BRFSSs is in fact to provide decision makers with evidence to base informed choices. By gathering data on quality of life, health perception and satisfaction, and within the general goal to increase the public health capability overall, PASSI and Passi d’Argento aim to monitor health profile of adult and elderly populations over time in relation to the Prevention Plans (at national and regional levels) [43 ] as well as to identify particularly vulnerable groups to be at risk and with specific healthcare needs [44 ].  4.5 Conclusions and perspectives PASSI and Passi d’Argento generate accurate data, which are highly relevant to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate programs and policies at different levels (local, regional, national) for NCD prevention and health promotion. By collecting, processing and disseminating comprehensive statistics continuously, the two Italian BRFSSs play the field for tackling the challenges posed by some HRSDGs and enable innovative approaches to support effectively processes of data sharing, progress tracking and decision-making, which are crucial for healthcare organizations and governments. Additionally, such a timely restitution for huge amounts of information accomplishes transparency and replicability expectations from the policy level, public domain, media, civil society, and scientific communities in the same way as they have been increasing over the past two decades. In the end, PASSI and Passi d’Argento show that, as currently reflected and acknowledged by the global scientific community, they definitely have a say in making real the commitment to “health in all policies” by providing numbers which can serve as propaedeutic or, in some cases, complementary ground to address a robust measurement of several HRSDG patterns.Summary table  Bullets statements on 'what was already known on the topic' • PASSI and Passi d’Argento generate accurate data which are highly relevant to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate programs and policies at different levels (local, regional, national) for NCD prevention and health promotion.  • Such a timely restitution for huge amounts of information accomplishes transparency and replicability expectations from the policy level, public domain, media, civil society, and scientific communities in the same way as they have been increasing over the past two decades.  • The two Italian BRFSSs set forth the idea that public health progresses is necessarily linked to a greater interaction between demand and supply of services on territory as well as between users and care providers on the real health needs and priorities, and on the evolution of interventions implemented.    Bullets statements on 'what this study added to our knowledge' • The PASSI and Passi d’Argento surveillances show that their data can serve as propaedeutic or, in some cases, complementary ground to address a robust measurement of several HRSDG patterns.  • The two systems result to be strong communication platforms producing evidence that, if well-structured and used, represents a real occasion to empower the health system, at all levels, and of the communities themselves.  • By collecting, processing and disseminating comprehensive statistics continuously, PASSI and Passi d’Argento play the field for tackling the challenges posed by some HRSDGs and enable innovative approaches to support effectively processes of data sharing, progress tracking and decision-making, which are crucial for healthcare organizations and governments.
