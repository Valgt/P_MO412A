                  Access to sustainable energy is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. A particular challenge for countries like the Philippines, is to provide sustainable energy on its far-flung islands. Renewable energy technologies hold substantial potential for improving sustainability and reliability while decreasing costs. We present a socio-economic impact survey for a case study island: Cobrador represents a typical small Philippine island with a population of approximately 1,000. The implementation of solar power and batteries led to increased service hours, affordability and environmental soundness. We applied a household questionnaire focusing on electricity usage patterns and targeted 170 randomly selected households representing 70% of the population. Our data show a clear positive impact of the intervention on access to education, information, health services, and perceived safety, whereas we found a weaker impact on income generation. Overall, we reveal a beneficial impact on different aspects of the household's daily routine. However, we also identify significant differences in the electricity usage pattern of below-average and above-average income households, specifically with the latter more frequently using electricity for income generation. Future sustainable energy interventions need to be aligned with programs incentivizing poor household's electricity use for enabling all households to equally profit from sustainable energy.

Access to sustainable energy is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. A particular challenge for countries like the Philippines, is to provide sustainable energy on its far-flung islands. Renewable energy technologies hold substantial potential for improving sustainability and reliability while decreasing costs. We present a socio-economic impact survey for a case study island: Cobrador represents a typical small Philippine island with a population of approximately 1,000. The implementation of solar power and batteries led to increased service hours, affordability and environmental soundness. We applied a household questionnaire focusing on electricity usage patterns and targeted 170 randomly selected households representing 70% of the population. Our data show a clear positive impact of the intervention on access to education, information, health services, and perceived safety, whereas we found a weaker impact on income generation. Overall, we reveal a beneficial impact on different aspects of the household's daily routine. However, we also identify significant differences in the electricity usage pattern of below-average and above-average income households, specifically with the latter more frequently using electricity for income generation. Future sustainable energy interventions need to be aligned with programs incentivizing poor household's electricity use for enabling all households to equally profit from sustainable energy.   Keywords Energy access  Energy-Poverty Nexus  Sustainable Development Goals, Socio-economic impact  Philippines    1 Introduction The global community has agreed on 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address various global development challenges and inequalities. The SDGs provide a framework to include social and environmental sustainability in development processes (Stevens and Kanie, 2016 ). Innovative, clean and sustainable technologies are crucial instruments for advancing towards these SDGs (Moyer and Bohl, 2019 ). Supportive technology policy is therefore of paramount importance to stimulate the development and diffusion of those technologies (Liu et al., 2019 ). An important example is the use of renewable energy (RE) technologies for achieving SDG #7: “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” (United Nations, 2015 ). Thus, many supranational institutions and national governments promote RE for the energy transition and rural electrification to provide and improve energy access and to address increasing energy demands in a sustainable manner (Almeshqab and Ustun, 2019 ). Energy access and electrification can provide opportunities for new businesses, extended study and working hours, better health and education infrastructure and new opportunities for community building activities (Karekezi and McDade, 2013 ). However, context-dependencies prevent generalizable conclusions about these interlinkages that ultimately depend on locally specific factors. Insights from case studies reveal that the capability to benefit from access to electricity strongly depends on the socio-economic and socio-cultural context (Kumar, 2018 ). It is hence necessary to assess the impact of modern and improved energy access at the local level to derive recommendations for policy makers and technology policy interventions (McCollum et al., 2018 ). The research direction is therefore bottom-up, using case studies to derive local and regional recommendations instead of taking a global approach and breaking it down to the country level. Such case studies need an interdisciplinary approach combining energy research with social sciences based approaches (Sovacool, 2014 ; Sovacool et al., 2015 ). This could be the analysis of an energy supply system by including the electricity user perspective via qualitative interviews, quantitative surveys and case studies, especially in less studied regions like remote areas of developing countries (Sovacool, 2012 ; Bhattacharyya and Palit, 2014 ). Lessons learnt of such studies can serve as crucial insights for addressing the need for access to energy in a more adequate and sustainable way in the future. In conclusion, supporting technology policy for SDGs needs context and regional specific research to improve evidence-based decision making and energy sector planning. In our paper, we address this need by investigating the impact of providing more affordable, reliable and sustainable access to energy on consumption patterns, appliance uptake and overall socio-economic development. We selected the local community of Cobrador Island in the Philippines as case study. Choosing a typical small island in this region allows to extend recommendations not only for the Philippine context but also for Southeast Asia. Many remote islands in this region suffer from unreliable power supply and in the Philippines, still 2.36 million households (HHs) lack access to electricity (IRENA, 2017a ). The purpose of our study is to highlight the effects of sustainable energy supply on the local community and to address the following research aspects to derive recommendations for policy makers:a) How can SDG#7 be achieved on remote islands and what are specific consumption patterns and appliance usages to be considered?  b) How is the achievement of SDG#7 addressing crosscutting SDG targets such as access to information, access to education, access to health services, income generation and other?  c) How can the achievement of SDG#7 contribute to poverty alleviation and addressing inequalities?    To find solutions to these questions we have developed and applied a quantitative questionnaire and surveyed a significant share of households on the case study island. We use descriptive statistics to explore the data and analyze relevant aspects in more detail. Findings were compared to historical data of electricity consumption patterns on the island and to results of other case studies. The specific measure that addressed SDG#7 on the case study island was the hybridization of a diesel generator with solar PV and battery storage to provide clean and reliable electricity on a 24/7 base. The geographical, demographic, socio-economic, infrastructural and institutional framework conditions of our case study reflect a situation comparable to a large number of islands in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Therefore, this case study analysis can serve for deriving implications for wider RE deployment in the region.  2 Background The background section introduces the context of this study. First, we examine the interlinkages between energy access, SDGs and RE. Second, we highlight the energy access situation in the Philippines. Finally, we introduce the background of the selected case study. 2.1 Global context: energy access and the sustainable development goals The lack of access to electricity hampers human development in many regards (Bhattacharyya, 2013 ). For example, a lack of modern lighting in households is considered to limit the ability to pursue not only productive activities after nightfall, but also educational and recreational activities. Likewise, business development and the provision of public services like health care and education are difficult (Bonan, 2017 ). Fig. 1   provides an overview on possible linkages between SDG#7 and other SDGs. The possible linkages of SDG #7 to the other SDGs have been studied to a large extend already (Le Blanc, 2015 ; Alloisio et al., 2017 ; McCollum et al., 2018 ). A strong interconnection is often found concluding that access to modern energy services enables the implementation of a series of other SDGs, hence significantly contributes to sustainable development in general. Access to modern energy forms is fundamental to human development and to support the alleviation of poverty (SDG #1) according to Akter (2017)  as well as Casillas and Kammen (2010) . Energy access is also critical to enhance agricultural yields and productivity, which can increase food security (SDG #2) (Acheampong, 2017 ). In terms of increased health and well-being (SDG #3), access to modern energy services can reduce diseases caused by the emissions of traditional biomass for cooking and of kerosene lamps (Amegah, 2016 ). Especially women are highly affected by indoor air pollution (Das et al., 2017 ). The use of refrigerators facilitates cooling of medicine, especially of vaccines. Moreover, it allows for the cooling of food, which on the one hand results in better hygiene and on the other hand in new economic opportunities by selling preserved food or ice (Palit and Chaurey, 2011 ). Access to modern lighting enables for studying after nightfall, and modern information and communication technologies in schools can raise the quality of education and information access, which contributes to SDG #4 (Collste et al., 2017 ). A strong impact of improved electricity access on women's safety and girls' school enrollment is found and it can empower women by improving their income-earning, e.g. through time-saving from household chores (SDG #5) (Akter, 2017 ). Time savings for women can also be used for productive activities and education. SDG #7 can hence have a strong positive impact on the SDGs #5 (Gender equality), #8 (Economic growth) and #10 (Reduced inequalities) (Burney et al., 2017 ). Moreover, decentralized renewable energy systems such as solar home systems (SHS) or village-scale solar systems can enable more participatory and inclusive processes for managing energy supply on the community-level (Kunze and Becker, 2015 ). Depending on the policies in place it can also help to reduce inequalities between poorer and wealthier households (SDG #10) (Casillas and Kammen, 2010 ). On a local as well as global scale SDG #7 is an enabling factor for the implementation of SDG #13 on climate change mitigation and adaptation (Cherian, 2015 ; Riahi et al., 2016 ; Alloisio et al., 2017 ; Gambhir A et al., 2017 ). Ensuring access to clean and modern cooking and heating energy can also lead to less disturbance of the local biodiversity and the ecosystems caused by firewood collection and thereby contribute to SDG #15 (Life on Land) (Pagdee, 2017 ). Whereas the positive impact of modern energy services on a variety of other fields might be evident, and many governments have acknowledged the importance of action in this field, many still struggle to deploy RE technologies, especially in remote areas. In many developing countries, complex and inadequate regulations, policies, and legal frameworks hamper the development of new RE or electrification projects and technologies (Blechinger, 2013 ; Brahim, 2014 ). Lack of financing for off-grid entrepreneurs and affordability of clean energy for poorer households is found to be a major challenge for the implementation of modern energy services (UNDP & ETH Zurich, 2018 ). Furthermore, the positive relations are highly dependent on the policy instruments in place. For example, if distributional costs of new energy policies (e.g. supporting RE and energy efficiency) fall disproportionately on the poor, then this could even work against the promotion of social, economic and political equality for all (McCollum et al., 2018 ). In conclusion, the positive effects of SDG#7 on other SDGs have been widely studied and acknowledged on a global scale. Nevertheless, country specific contexts need to be considered when designing supporting policies. Thus, findings from interventions targeting SDG #7 in remote areas of the Philippines are of importance for more accurately and sustainably designing an appropriate technology policy in the future.  2.2 Country context: energy access in the Philippines As an archipelago comprised of more than 7,000 islands the Philippines are a considerably fragmented country (Boquet, 2017 ). Continuous power supply is provided to the most populous and economic relevant “on-grid” islands through two main electric grids (IRENA, 2017b ).  Isolated grids supply the “off-grid” areas, which are defined as islands or remote areas not connected to one of the two main grids. Frequent power rationalization in off-grid areas is a consequence of high costs due to the use of diesel generators (Roxas and Santiago, 2016 ) and 24 hours supply is mostly not available (DoE, 2016 ). Electricity users in the “off-grid” areas are only obliged to pay a socially acceptable generation rate (SAGR) which is defined per region by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) of the Philippines. The difference to the true cost of generation rate (TCGR) is cross-subsidized from the universal charge for missionary electrification (UCME) which is a surcharge to electricity bills in the “on-grid” areas. The escalation of UCME subsidy is an increasing burden to the national funds of the country (Bertheau and Blechinger, 2018 ). The remaining non electrified areas (“missionary areas”) are a large number of small islands with no power supply or informal power supply only. The objective of the government of the Philippines is to provide access to clean and continuous energy supply to all parts of the country for improving living conditions. Therefore, 100% electrification of all households by 2022 was set as target within the Philippine Energy Plan (PEP) (DOE, 2015 ). Nevertheless, the share of electrified households was only at 89.6% in 2016, reflecting 2.36 million households without electricity supply and many other with only basic and limited energy supply (IRENA, 2017a ). The Philippine Renewable Energy Act (RE Act), inaugurated in 2008 (RA9513, 2008 ), serves as technology policy instrument for stimulating the deployment of RE technologies in the country (Roxas and Santiago, 2016 ). High expectation arose as a large number of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives was implemented under it (Rosellon, 2017 ), with specific schemes envisioned to facilitate rural electrification through private sector participation. However, a study on the risks and uncertainties of RE implementation on the Philippines (Bertheau et al., 2019 ), indicates that the lack of clear implementation of these policies hinder them from successfully supporting the energy transition on remote islands. Numerous attempts for RE based electrification in the framework of international development cooperation were undertaken in the Philippines. Early initiatives focused on deploying SHS (Heruela, 1992 ), followed by hybrid energy systems comprised of solar PV, batteries and diesel generators for back-up power supply (Hong and Abe, 2012 ). Although many donor-based RE projects have been conducted by USAID, GIZ, UNDP and others (Marquardt, 2015 ), little information on their evaluation can be found. Several studies (Hong and Abe, 2012 ; Marquardt, 2015 ; Yaqoot et al., 2016 ) indicate that most of the donor-based projects proved unsustainable due to weak local capacities for proper operation and maintenance of the systems which then led to low acceptance towards new technologies among the population. In summary, the Philippines are a renewable resource rich country which currently fails in exploiting its full potential to achieve SDG#7. More locally adapted interventions are necessary to facilitated the implementation of RE technologies on remote islands and provide access to energy.  2.3 Case study context: cobrador Island solar – Diesel project Cobrador Island forms a single barangay1  1 Smallest administrative unit in the Philippines   as part of the province of Romblon, located centrally in the Philippines. The island is small with an area of 2.6 km² comprised by a small beach stripe and mainly hilly terrains. It is home to approximately 1,000 people living in about 250 households scattered over seven sitios2  2 Part of a barangay  . The island has a barangay hall (town hall), health station, a primary school and kindergarten and the main source of income is fishing. With these typical characteristics, Cobrador island is representative for a large number of small islands in the Philippines and the region (Meschede, 2018 ). Some households of the island were initially electrified in 1997 by means of SHS within a governmental electrification program. In 2010, the local electric cooperative (EC), installed a diesel generator of 15 kW capacity to address an increasing demand. However, due to high fuel costs electricity was provided for eight hours per day and due to difficult terrain to 138 HHs only. This situation changed with the inauguration of the Cobrador Island Solar – Diesel Project in August 2016, which facilitated 24 hour electricity supply. The new hybrid system consists of a solar capacity of 30 kW, battery (lithium-ion) capacity of 180 kWh and a diesel back-up generator of 15 kW. As a result it improved the reliability of supply (24 h), affordability (50% electricity price reduction) and environmental soundness (renewable energy share of up to 92% per day) (Bertheau et al., 2019 ). In the first year of operation the bulk of required electricity was supplied by the solar plant with 32.7 MWh and 10.6 MWh were supplemented by the diesel generator (Fajilagutan, 2018 ). This reflects an average RE share of 75%. Solar PV and battery storage was selected as appropriate RE technology given its matureness and ease of installation. Other RE technology options were not considered given the unfeasibility of installation (wind power) or uncertain fuel supply (biomass). Hybrid energy systems are considered as important energy supply option for island and remote communities (Kuang et al., 2016 ), as existing fossil fuel systems can be stepwise transitioned to RE based energy systems and thereby gradually decarbonized (Neves et al., 2014 ). The intervention was realized through international collaboration in the framework of the Asian Development Bank's Energy for all (E4ALL) initiative which aims at contributing to SDG#7 through various activities. The project included technical and financial cooperation for the Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Korea Energy Agency (KEA) and the National Electrification Administration (NEA) of the Philippines. The overall costs summed up to approx. 500 thousand USD split between KEA (300,000 USD grant fund), ADB (100,000 USD grant fund) and NEA (100,000 USD loan fund). ROMELCO contributed with workforce, constructed the powerhouse and purchased the necessary land. The outlined case study presents an example for the deployment of an innovative and sustainable energy solution through technology policy. The specific conditions of the island are comparable to a large number of islands in the Philippines and in the region. Given the remoteness of the island, external influences are low and clear system boundaries are defined. This makes the island a suitable research subject to understand the socio-economic implications of an intervention targeting SDG #7 with a focus on providing and improving electricity access through RE.   3 Material and methods Our study mainly relies on primary data from Cobrador Island. The primary data collection builds upon a household survey since this allows for assessing the impact of an improved and RE based energy supply on the household level. By covering other characteristics of the studied HHs such as socio-economic data it is possible to study coherences and derive key findings. Surveys are a cornerstone of empirical research in the field of social science based energy research (Sovacool et al., 2018 ) and are combined with literature analysis and data on historical electricity consumption for this study. The material and methods section describes the development of the applied household questionnaire, the preparation of the field survey, the implementation of the field survey and the limitations faced during the data collection. 3.1 Questionnaire design We developed the applied questionnaire in an iterative approach to assure its appropriateness and applicability (Preston, 2009 ). Specific challenges can occur when conducting questionnaire surveys in remote and marginalized communities of developing countries, such as low educational level of respondents, cultural traditions, gender roles, local languages (UN-DESA, 2005 ). To address these challenges, Philippine experts (scholars from University of the Philippines - Diliman), familiar with the case study region, were involved in the questionnaire design from an early stage on. Additionally, we analyzed relevant literature and questionnaires applied for addressing similar research questions, e.g. Sullivan and Barnes (2006) , Hong and Abe (2012) , and Sovacool et al. (2018) . The iterative development and design process included the following steps: (1) Design of first questionnaire draft based on literature analysis. (2) Feedback round with Philippine and international experts. (3) Design of second questionnaire draft based on feedback. (4) Double blind translation of questionnaire from English to Tagalog and Tagalog to English. (5) Design of third questionnaire draft based on issues revealed during translation. (6) Pretesting of questionnaire, workshop and training with group of enumerators. (7) Creation of fourth questionnaire draft based on feedback from pretesting and workshop. During the field survey, the team conducted daily meetings for feedback and necessary adaption of the research design. Fig. 2   illustrates the approach applied for developing and designing the questionnaire. The finally applied questionnaire is comprised of four sections with 58 main questions, and additional follow-up and sub-questions. Most questions are closed-ended but few are open-ended questions to account for not anticipated responses (Sullivan and Barnes, 2006 ). Answering the questionnaire took approximately one hour during pretesting and during the field survey. Table 1   presents and describes the four main sections of the questionnaire.  3.2 Survey design We applied a stratified random sampling technique for the selection of respondents to make sure that all households, within the predefined household classes, have the same probability of consideration. Data on monthly electricity consumption, of all households of the case study island, served as stratification variable. Data was classified by means of the Jenks optimization method for minimizing the deviation from the average within a class and for maximizing the deviation to the average of other classes (Jenks, 1967 ). We applied four classes since it provides an acceptable goodness of variance fit (GVF) value with 0.92. Table 2   presents the derived classes based on the electricity consumption of households. We determined a statistically representative sample of at least 158 HHs questionnaires based on a population of 239 households, a 95% confidence interval, and 5% margin of error and non-response factor (Barlett et al., 2001 ). According to the share of the total population of each class, it was then determined how many households of each class had to be interviewed (Table 2 ). For each class the proportionate amount of respondents was randomly selected for the final sample. On site, the enumerators approached only the randomly derived households through asking the villagers for directions. For anonymization reasons, a code was assigned to each household in the questionnaire. In case that the assigned household was not available for an interview for any reason (e.g. declined to respond, absence, only underage household members available), the enumerator selected the next household of the same class from a randomly comprised list. Finally, it was possible to interview 170 HHs, considered as sufficient to expect a sampling error close +/- 5% at a 95% confidence interval for the given population (Sovacool et al., 2018 ).  3.3 1.8. Household questionnaire survey The author and a team of five enumerators, all volunteers and students from the University of the Philippines – Diliman, conducted the field survey. The team of enumerators conducted most of the questionnaires due to their proficiency in Tagalog and the local dialect (mix of Tagalog and Cebuano). Prior to the survey the local government unit, electric cooperative, barangay captain (community unit) and local leaders, as well as interested inhabitants were invited to a stakeholder meeting informing about content and purpose of the study, and assuring confidentiality of responses in order to meet the ethical standards of cross-cultural studies. The questionnaire were digitized and each enumerator was provided with a tablet applying KoBoToolbox© which is a free open source tool for mobile data collection. The tablet approach was selected to minimize survey costs and material use (Leisher, 2014 ). Before starting with the questionnaire, each enumerator explained about purpose, content and length of the questionnaire explicitly highlighting that the respondent can decline to respond to the entire questionnaire or single questions. The household head was addressed for the interview; in case of absence another full-aged household member was asked to respond to the questionnaire. Finally, 170 questionnaires were conducted (Fig. 3  ).  3.4 Statistical data analysis In order to derive statistically valid conclusions based on the collected primary data, a range of tools and methods can be applied. Here, collected data was compiled into a single dataset and prepared for further processing. The statistical data analysis was carried out with the software SPSS©3  3 IBM SPSS Statistics 25  . Minor data cleaning and the definition of variable types was necessary before statistical analysis were applied. Descriptive statistics served to gain a comprehensive overview of the current socio-economic situation as well as the general usage of electricity on the case study island. Frequency distributions, cross tables, and mean/median values were used to describe the collected data. In order to analyze the data with regard to differences between poorer and wealthier households, income groups were separated by the mean income per month. Households whose income was above the mean were classified as “above-average income households”, households with an average monthly income below the mean were grouped as “below-average income households”. On the basis of this classification, several hypotheses were tested by means of chi-square test, t-test and Mann-Whitney-U test based on the variable type and data characteristics focused on.  3.5 Limitations Only a few households declined to respond to the questionnaire. In contrast to that, the arrival of the enumerator team were attracting a significant share of people of the visited communities. Thus, it was sometimes challenging to keep the privacy of interviews and it was necessary to request neighbors and passers-by to not disturb the interview. Additionally, neighbors of interviewed households offered or requested to hold an interview with them and it was necessary to explain that respondents are selected randomly. Another limitation from the approach is a probable bias in responses for several reasons: Although the enumerators were comprehensively trained in conducting the interviews, a bias based on the enumerator cannot be entirely ruled out. Another limitation could be a bias in responses to the interviews. Although enumerators made clear that they are not representing a governmental unit or the electric cooperative respondents may have responded according to what they perceived as the favored answer. No disaggregated baseline data on the aspects analyzed are available for the case study. The impacts assessed here might thus not represent long lasting developments. An attempt was made to reconstruct the pre-electrification state and examine the changes by including respective questions in the household survey. For all quantitative data gathered in the household survey, e.g. monetary data about incomes and expenses, uncertainty regarding the reliability and accuracy must be taken into consideration. For most of the information no exact accounts are held by the households and statements are mostly based on respondent's estimates. Another noteworthy limitation of the research approach is the sole focus on access to electricity since providing clean energy for cooking is another decisive factor for achieving SDG#7.   4 Results In the results section we present the main findings from the household survey. We highlight socio-economic characteristics, electricity consumption patterns, electric appliances inventories and perceived changes of the hybrid system implementation for the surveyed households. We put a specific emphasize on differences between below and above-average income households to study the effect of providing sustainable electricity supply on inequality and poverty alleviation. The potential for income generation is considered as most important for alleviating poverty and inequality and is therefore focused on although other parameter, e.g. child education success rate or improved health rate could be eligible parameters for assessing the impact of SDG#7 interventions. 4.1 Socio-economic characteristics of households We interviewed 170 out of 239 households for the survey. Table 3   summarizes key characteristics of the HHs. The average age of respondents is 46.7 years and more than 64% of respondents are female. On average, 3.6 persons live in one household which is below the national average of 4.4 persons (PSA, 2017 ). With the 170 HHs a population of more than 602 individuals (39% younger than 18) is represented. The highest educational degree per HH is predominantly primary school (44.4%) (six years of education) followed by secondary school (32%) (ten years of education). HH income correlates with years of education for the highest degree in the household (r = . 284 ,  p = . 000 ,  N = 162   ). Analysis reveal that the mean income is 8,558 PHP (~165 USD4  4 For PHP – USD conversion we apply a currency exchange rate as of 1st  of March 2018: 1 USD = 52 PHP.  ) per HH and month (Median = 4,841 PHP; SD = 10,109 PHP). For further analysis we classify HHs with monthly income larger than 8,558 PHP as above-average income HHs (n = 50) and HHs with monthly income lower than the average as below-average income HHs (n = 114). Mean HHs expenditures per month are 6,045 PHP (~116 USD) (Median = 4,531 PHP; SD = 5,748 PHP). High standard deviations for both income and expenditures reflect the large inequality among the HHs. Additionally, the responses show that a large share of 32% of households is poor (monetary wise) with a weekly income lower than 500 PHP (9.6 USD) compared to the World Bank's extreme poverty line of 1.9 USD/day (Warwick et al. 2018). Many HHs have diversified their income sources and it is common that both, men and women participate in income generating activities with women often additionally taking care of the household chores. The main income source is fishing (47.7%). Followed by home business activities (17.6%) of which the most common is the operation of a small shop (sari-sari store). Further home business types are boat manufacturing, mat weaving and copra drying. Other income sources (10.1%) include charcoal production and selling, carpentry, construction and some support from government programs. More than 43% of the HHs receive remittances from relatives which contributes to overall income by 5.8%. Farming mostly serves as means for self-subsistence. Most HHs have very intermittent incomes due to the dependency on fish catches and selling. The major share of the HHs’ income is spent for food (59.9%). HHs with schoolchildren spend a large share of their income on education, with an overall expenditure of 14.7%. Older children have to visit secondary school on another island, where they stay during the week in paid accommodation. Domestic needs comprise drinkable water, medicines, toiletries and baby foods (9.7%). Transportation expenditures are relatively high due to the remoteness of the island (7.6%). Electricity is a minor share of expenditures (6.3%) and other expenditures are spend for leisure activities. Similar expenditure patterns have been reported for other regions of the Philippines (Agbola et al., 2017 ). A higher share of below-average income HHs (44.4%) spend more than 75% of their total expenditures for food compared to above-average income HH (24.5%). However no statistically significant differences in expenditure patterns between income groups were identified.  4.2 Electricity consumption patterns Prior to the implementation of the hybrid system intervention, a steep growth in electricity demand was expected once the electric service was made available for 24 hours per day. Electricity for refrigeration and ice-making were among the identified uses e.g. in support of the island's fishing sector. Fig. 4   shows the annual energy sales development. Energy sales increased from 2015 to 2016 through the implementation of the hybrid energy system which included the connection of additional HHs and the provision of 24 hours supply. Energy sales further increased through appliance uptake from 2016 to 2017 and averaged at a daily demand of 142 kWh/d. Fig. 5   highlights the growth of the average peak demand on a daily basis. Compared to 2016 the maximal peak demand for 2017 and 2018 increased significantly during early afternoon and in the evening hours. The maximal daily electricity demand observed for 2017 and 2018 exceed the average demand by far with 270 kWh (2017) and 279 kWh (2018). Such extreme demands exceed the capacity limits of the implemented system. We can conclude that the provision of 24 hours supply increased electricity consumption and that large differences in mean and maximal daily demands occur. .Almost all HHs use electricity from the hybrid energy system as primary source of electricity (97.7% of HHs). Other and additional devices such as automotive batteries (7% of HHs), SHS (12% of HHs) and small diesel gensets (2% of HHs) are applied by few HHs and rather occasionally as a back-up source. The majority of HHs have a relatively small monthly consumption of up to 30 kWh. According to the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access (MTF) most of the HH can be classified into Tier 2 and Tier 3 (Bhatia and Angelou, 2015 ). The cross tabulation (Table 4  ) indicates a clear difference between income groups since a high share of below-average HHs (34%) uses only very little electricity per month. Chi-square test reveals a significance with medium effect size, (χ 2  ( 3 )  = 24.1 ,  p = . 000 ,  φ = . 394 ,  N = 155 ) .     For a further understanding of the income's group capabilities to use electricity for income generation we explore for coherences between income groups, income generation through an own business (taking place at the HH – e.g. shop, handicraft, e.g.), and if electricity is required for such activity. Table 5   provides an overview on observed cell frequencies and expected cell frequencies for the presented questions. The results show that income group not significantly affects the likelihood of income-generation through an own (home) business (χ 2  ( 1 )  = 3.37 ,  p = . 06 ,  φ = . 0144   ). However, above-average income groups are more likely using electricity for income generation in their HH, with χ 2  ( 1 )  = 5.66 ,  p = . 017 ,  φ = . 187    (medium effect size). The majority of businesses run by both income groups was set up before the implementation of 24 hours electricity supply. Most HHs approve (59.4%) the current electricity price of 15 PHP/kWh (approx. 0.29 USD/kWh). A certain dissatisfaction originates from many villager's knowledge that the electricity price of the neighboring larger island (determined through the SAGR) is half the price of their electricity charge. Above-average income HHs are less satisfied with the electricity price and occasionally demanded for an adjustment of the price to that of the neighboring islands during the interviews (Fig. 6  ), we reveal a significant difference between income groups by applying Fisher's exact test (p = . 039 ,  φ = . 255 ,  N = 157   ). Respondents stated that they spent more (20%) and even a lot more (15.3%) money for electricity before the hybrid system intervention. Contrasted by 24.1% stating that they spent approximately the same amount for electricity or even less. Fig. 7   shows differences between below- and above-average income groups: A higher share of above-average income HHs states to spend less money since the hybrid system intervention. A significant difference was detected by applying chi-square test, ( χ 2  ( 4 )  = 10.0 ,  p = . 04 ,  φ = . 267 ,  N = 141  )   . When asked if respondents would pay a higher price for electricity the slight majority agreed to be willing to pay double the price (59.2% of above-average income HHs & 51.9% of below-average income HHs), which quickly decreases to overwhelming disagreement when asked for triple or quadruple the price (Fig. 8  ). No statistically significant correlation between income and willingness to pay for electricity supply was identified. The main problems with the electricity supply stated are power outages, damaged appliances through outages and high costs. Most of the HHs need electricity during evening hours when light is required or for gathering at home for jointly watching TV (Fig. 9  ). Another important use of electricity is for lighting purposes, as a high share of children (51.4%) study after sunset and require electricity (98.6%) to do so. Both income groups show similar patterns when asked for the most important period of the day for which they need electricity (Fig. 9 ). Ove rall, our results indicate that electricity is primarily used for entertainment and information gathering, additionally constant lighting allows for increased study hours for children. Nevertheless, the direct impact on the HHs depends on consumption of electricity and electric appliance inventory. Here we find that above-average income HHs consume considerably more electricity and at the same time profit more from the reduced electricity prices. Paradoxically, above-average income HHs are less content with the applied electricity charge and both groups do not differ in their willingness to pay more for electricity. On the community level the hybrid renewable energy system improved access to health and education since the elementary school now provides computer classes and the services of the health center have improved through continuous access to electricity allowing to power more medical electrical devices. Since both school and health center are public entities these outcomes are accessible to all households. Additionally, the higher reliability of electricity supply allows for replacing some rather health-affecting appliances such as kerosene lamps, and more sensitive electric appliances, e.g. for entertainment, such as sound systems or multimedia devices, can be powered with a reduced risk of damage through power outages. For lighting purposes, a larger variety of sources besides electricity is used, e.g. candles (17% of HH), kerosene lamps (18% of HH) and rechargeable flashlights (70% of HH), which are important appliances for night fishing activities. The findings indicate that the HHs favor the electricity from the hybrid energy system over other and formerly used solutions.  4.3 Electric appliances We asked the HHs for their electric appliance inventory to study the use of certain devices. Electric lighting is the main electricity appliance used in almost all surveyed households. 92% of the HHs use electricity for lighting, on average a typical HH possess 2.5 light bulbs. A typical appliance inventory consists additionally of cell & smart phones (88%), television (73%) and fan (70%). Followed by other entertainment appliances such as DVD players, sound systems and radios. Household appliances and IT appliances are less frequent. Wealthier households own generally more (Fisher's exact test: p = . 000 ,  φ = . 279 ,  N = 164   ) and more energy intensive appliances. Results show a significance between income groups and ownership of fridges by applying chi-square test (χ 2  ( 1 )  = 12.80 ,  p = . 000 ,  φ = . 279 ,  N = 164   ), ownership of washing machines by applying Fisher's exact test ( p = . 004 ,  φ = . 248 ,  N = 164   ) and ownership of water heaters by applying Fisher's exact test (p = . 01 ,  φ = . 224 ,  N = 164 )   . Mainly firewood, charcoal and in few instances LPG stoves are used for cooking, but no electrical ovens are owned or used. Only one household owns an air conditioning system. Fig. 10   shows the quantity of HHs with certain appliances and the quantity of appliances purchased after the increase of electric service hours. The data indicates that HHs purchased some appliance types more often since the provision of 24 hours power supply. This is especially true for appliances outside the light, TV, fan, cell phone standard set. Appliances with highest growth rates are water heaters (86%), refrigerators (76%) and sound systems (73%), which are appliances with high or constant power demand or vulnerable to power outages. Increased appliance purchases and more frequent appliance usage contributed to the rapid demand growth in addition to new connections. We asked for planned appliance purchases to investigate if the power demand is likely to further increase. However, the larger share of HHs (59%) stated not to plan to purchase any appliances in the next two years. This indicates that first demand for essential electric appliances is saturated. Nevertheless, a number of HHs still plans to purchase energy-intensive appliances like fridges (14%) and washing machines (4%) which can significantly add to the baseload and peak load in the hybrid energy system. Fig. 11   provides an overview on planned electric appliance purchases. Above-average income HHs plan to purchase more energy intensive appliances (fridge & washing machine).  4.4 Perceived impact of SDG#7 intervention Due to the absence of socio-economic data characterizing the situation prior to the SDG#7 intervention and availability of 24 hours power supply, we asked for the respondents perceived changes after the hybrid energy system intervention for the six key target fields of safety situation, education, information, communication, income and health services. Respondents were asked to state to agree or disagree to the statements, using a 5-point likert scale (strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neither disagree nor agree (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5)). Table 6   provides an overview about the perceived changes. The objective is to identify whether any significant differences in the perception of the aforementioned topic areas exist between below-average and above-average income groups. The majority of HH respondents agrees or strongly agrees that the safety situation (>74%), access to education (>73%), information (>82%), communication (>89%) and health services (68%) has improved or increased. For the income situation, we find a less clear picture with 41% disagreement and 39% agreement. When taking into account the income groups we find only few noteworthy differences: A higher share of below-average income HHs (+15%) perceives the safety situation as improved and an additional 13% of below-average HHs perceives the education situation as improved compared to above-average income HHs. However, the responses of income groups towards the perception of the income situation differs distinctively: More below-average income households (+19%) overall disagree (sum of strongly disagree & disagree) that the HHs income increased after the intervention whereas more above-average income HH (+18%) overall agree (sum of strongly agree & agree) that the HHs income has increased. We applied further tests to explore if the differences between income groups are statistically significant. Since the considered six dependent variables are ordinal scaled and not normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney U test is applied. The only significant difference was detected for statement (5) regarding income generation: Below-average income households (m = 3) perceive significant less improved or increased income opportunities compared to above-average income groups (m = 4), with z=2.39, p=0.017, and medium effect size r = 0.169.   5 Discussion Our findings indicate that upgrading the former diesel-based energy system to a hybrid energy system using solar power and battery storage clearly improved the livelihood and wellbeing of the local community. This was achieved by improving sustainability (increased RE share), reliability (establishing 24 hours supply) and affordability (tariff reduction). However, our findings reveal that HHs do not equally profit from the intervention. In the following we are highlighting the implications for energy access planning, implications for addressing further SDGs, implications for addressing poverty and inequalities and contextualize the findings of our case study. 5.1 Implications for energy access planning and SDG#7 The installed hybrid system successfully addresses SDG#7. However, we find that a large number of HHs use small amounts of electricity compared to few HHs with a larger consumption. This becomes obvious when comparing the identified consumption levels with the MTF (Bhatia and Angelou, 2015 ). The majority of HHs do not exceed tier 2 or 3 of the MTF characterized by a monthly consumption of <6 kWh and <30 kWh respectively (compare section 4.2 ). One could criticize the MTF for its inability to accurately access the demand for vital services required for HHs’ wellbeing (Groh et al., 2016 ) and given its global scope it is inaccurate to national conditions (Pelz et al., 2018 ), but due to our locally collected data it can be a good guidance for energy access planning in the Philippines. The most common appliances (light bulb, fan, television, phone) owned by HHs of this case study reflect the typical appliance inventory for tier 2 HHs (compare section 4.3 ). It shows that an oversizing of supply systems would take place when assuming a Tier 5 level for all HHs. SHS are an appropriate technology to deliver electricity access at least for tier 1 and 2 (Narayan et al., 2019 ). Whereas tier 3 can be addressed with SHS as well, tier 4 and 5 are currently out of reach of SHS products. Thus, depending on the local situation, it could be reasonable to supply remote and low consumption HHs initially with SHS. However, electrification with SHS is less capable of powering productive loads (Bhattacharyya and Palit, 2014 ). A more accurate assessment of electricity demands and planning of the energy system can avoid oversizing and suitable approaches have been presented in the scientific literature (Riva et al., 2019 ). For future energy access planning for similar islands, it is necessary to decide if all HHs shall be connected to the hybrid system based on detailed electricity demand assessment. Deploying SHS to far away and scattered HHs with low present and low projected electricity demands can lower the overall costs while addressing the surveyed electricity demands. HHs could be connected to the hybrid energy system in a later step when an increased demand economically justifies a connection. Above all, it is important to consider whether two different electrification schemes would lead to increased energy injustice as demonstrated for other case studies (Monyei et al., 2018 ).  5.2 Implications for addressing further sustainable development goals HHs use electricity mainly for leisure and entertainment (TV, cell phone, sound system) and well-being (light bulb, fan) as indicated through the analysis of the HHs’ appliance inventory (see Fig. 10 ) which is in accordance with other findings for the Philippines (Hong and Abe, 2012 ). The majority of HHs is satisfied with the electricity service/costs (compare Fig. 6 ) and consider supply safety and reliability as most important, similar findings have been found for case studies in South Asia (Sharma and Chan, 2016 ). Further SDGs have been addressed through implementing SDG#7: As an example SDG#3 “Good health and well-being” by realizing more reliable electricity supply in the health station, SDG#4 “Quality education” by using appliances such as computers and fans in the school and by using electric lighting for studying at home, and SDG#6 “Clean water and sanitation” by powering devices for sterilizing water. We focus with this case study on electricity supply but recommend that future studies and interventions targeting SDG#7 have to address energy demand for cooking. For the case study, observations reveal that cooking is largely based on fuelwood and in few cases HHs use LPG stoves. Thereby the potential of clean energy supply for addressing SDG#3 “Good health and wellbeing”, SDG#5 “Gender equality” and SDG#15 “Life on land” is not fully exploited as cooking based on fuelwood negatively affect these three SDGs (Das et al., 2017 ). Recent studies have revealed that innovative electric cooking technologies can be beneficially incorporated in hybrid energy systems (Lombardi et al., 2019 ). Our findings additionally indicate that HHs of different income groups are not equally capable to profit from the realization of SDG#7, therefore the leverage effects on SDG#1 “No poverty” and SDG#10 “Reduced inequalities” are not fully harnessed.  5.3 Implications for addressing poverty and inequality Our results show that the HHs perceive an overall positive impact on their livelihoods. However, the perceived impact on income generation is divided among the income groups. Here, we identify that the majority of above-average income HHs perceive a positive impact on income generation whereas a high share of below-average HHs perceives no impact on income generation (compare section 4.4 ). It can be concluded that there is so far no significant increase in income generating activities through electricity on Cobrador Island. Other case studies have found similar results for India (Khandker et al., 2012 ), Brazil (Obermaier et al., 2012 ) and Rwanda (Lenz et al., 2017 ). There are however significant differences between above-average and below-average income HHs in terms of electricity usage. The results show that above-average HHs use electricity more frequently for income generating activities and own more appliances with which income can be generated. We propose that projects addressing SDG#7 must incorporate specific poverty reducing measures coupled with the implementation of more reliable, affordable and sustainable electricity. Such measures could include to offer micro-finance products (MFP) for appliance purchases, to implement a cross-subsidy scheme within the community or initiating cooperative-based companies. MFP could enable below-average income households to profit from the improved electricity supply through small loans for purchasing important appliances, such as refrigerators or appliances allowing for productive use (Gutiérrez-Nieto and Serrano-Cinca, 2019 ). However, an analysis of potential markets for the producible products needs to be conducted first to ensure that products find sufficient demand (Lenz et al., 2017 ). A cross-subsidy scheme within the community could enable a higher usage of electricity for below-average income HHs subsidized by above-average income HHs. Most probably the social acceptability of such an approach would be a challenge. Nevertheless, for hybridization projects on other islands the communities could be consulted if they would agree to implement a cross-subsidy scheme if this would increase the likelihood of project realization. Finally, strengthening cooperative based business models could contribute to poverty alleviation and could even contribute to balance power demands in the system. As an example, a cooperative owned cold storage could be implemented through selling out cooperative shares. Ice for cooling fish catches and food is an important product. If that could be offered in an affordable manner to cooperative shareholders it would reduce HHs expenditures, reduce the demand for individual refrigerators and could even serve for balancing the power grid (through dumb charge). Future research should focus on incorporating one of the aforementioned measure into the planning of rural electrification and SDG#7 interventions.  5.4 Contextualization of findings Case study research as applied here allows for an in-depth examination of a particular subject (e.g. the impact of RE and addressing the SDGs on local communities) but lacks breadth and external validity (Sovacool et al., 2018 ). Nevertheless, contextualization provides some crucial findings for further energy access planning in insular framework conditions. With a population of approx. 1,000, fishing as main source of income, an accessibility of 45 -60 minutes by boat and a formerly unreliable power supply our case study is representative for a large number of similar islands in the Philippines (Bertheau and Blechinger, 2018 ). The specific number is difficult to access, however a recent geospatial analysis estimated a number of 2,200 islands with a population of 1.49 million without any known electricity supply for the Philippines (Bokharee et al., 2018 ). Fishing as main source of income was identified for other cases studies in the Philippines (Hong and Abe, 2012 ) and islands with a population of up to 1,000 have been found as the largest group among surveyed not electrified Philippine islands (Meschede, 2018 ). The mean income (8 thousand PHP) and mean expenditure (6 thousand PHP) are lower than the national monthly mean HH income of 22 thousand PHP and mean expenditure of 18 thousand PHP (PSA, 2017 ). Reflecting that the case study island represents typical islands deprived of development and growth. With 32% the share of HHs living below the poverty line is higher than the national average of 21.6% (PSA, 2017 ). Hence our findings can be extrapolated for other similar islands and serve for deriving policy recommendations. Furthermore, a large number of small islands with characteristics similar to our case study can be found in the region but outside the Philippines, in particular in Indonesia, Malaysia and Pacific small island states (Blechinger et al., 2016 ).   6 Conclusion and recommendations A household questionnaire survey was conducted for the case study of Cobrador to assess the impact of providing continuous renewable based power supply on local development and on the SDGs. The implemented hybrid RE system was found as an appropriate solution to address SDG#7 as affordability, reliability and sustainability of power supply were improved. Based on the data collected, we can address the three research questions as outlined in the introduction section. First, we find that daily consumption and peak demands increased most rapidly in the first year of operation. Electricity is mostly used for entertaining purposes as television and sound systems belong to the most frequently owned electric appliances besides light bulbs, fans and cell phones. However, most HHs consume only small amounts of electricity and would be best described by tier 2 or tier 3 of the MTF. Second, we find a positive impact on SDG#3, SDG#4 and SDG#6, as all households, regardless of their income profit from improved access to education and health services. Third, we find mainly the above-average income households using electricity for income generation purposes. We conclude that SDG#1 and SDG#10 are insufficiently addressed in the implementation scheme and recognize a threat of further increasing inequalities in communities provided with access to electricity through SDG#7 interventions. We consider this as an important finding and starting point for future social science based energy research. The implications of our findings are that future technology policies supporting the SDG#7 need to address the following issues: Appropriate energy access planning and supporting measures for addressing poverty and inequality. More appropriate and evidence based energy access planning has to be enhanced for all involved stakeholders. Future planning should discuss if low consumption HHs should be initially supplied with SHS and if then a stepwise connection of HH based on the projected electricity demand could increase the feasibility and replicability of hybrid RE systems. Supplementary measures are necessary to prevent that SDG#7 interventions lead to increased inequalities in terms of income and opportunities in small island communities. Stimulating productive use could be an appropriate measure but has to be carefully designed according to local conditions and accessible markets. Supporting cooperative ownership and business models (e.g. for cold storages) could enhance communities and even serve for balancing small power grids. Leverage effects of SDG#7 on other SDGs should be more effectively harnessed with supporting measures especially with regard to clean cooking. As an example the promotion of electricity use in schools, health stations and barangay halls increases the impacts on SDG#3 and SDG#4. Incentivizing the purchase of clean cooking, water sanitation and food preservation products can address further SDGs. Furthermore, this case study finds important aspects for future interdisciplinary research focusing both on technical and socio-economic aspects. Energy and economic related research should focus on tools for the cost-effective design of hybrid energy systems incorporating the socio-economic framework conditions. Social science based energy research should focus on the potential integration of community cross subsidy schemes, cooperative anchor clients and productive use in SDG#7 interventions for delivering added value to beneficiaries.
