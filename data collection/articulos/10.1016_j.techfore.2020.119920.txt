                  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was defined by United Nations Member States to provide a list of sustainable development goals (SDGs) aimed to achieve a more sustainable future. Greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions are now at their highest levels in history, and freight transport and logistics service industry has been recognized as one of the main contributors to environmental degradation. Nowadays, the influence of enabling technologies and green practices on business activities is growing and offers interesting opportunities to large firms and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) operating in freight transport and logistics service industry. More in details, affordable and scalable practices and solutions are now available to support companies to adopt measures able to reduce emissions and promote climate action goals. On the other hand, specific policies supporting the adoption of innovative practices and technologies are playing a pivotal role in assisting companies and supply chains to achieve SDGs. In this context, this paper analyses the degree of adoption of emerging green practices and enabling technologies in European logistics service providers (LSPs). The results of the cross-country analysis highlight a variety of behaviours of LSPs operating in the different countries in terms of managerial and technological strategies.

This agenda provides a list of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed to achieve a better and more sustainable future (Chin and Jacobsson, 2015 ; Gusmão Caiado et al., 2018 ; Mehmann and Teuteberg, 2015 ). Greenhouse gas and CO2  emissions are now at their highest levels in history and Climate Action, namely Goal 13, is one of the different goals promoted amongst others. In the last few years, there was an increasing number of papers dealing with the topic of environmental sustainability in manufacturing and service industries (Seuring and Müller, 2008 ; Vachon and Klassen, 2008 ; Laari et al., 2018 ) due to the growing number of environmental requirements established by the climate change agreements (Kyoto Protocol, 1998 ; Copenhagen Accord, 2009 ; Doha Amendment, 2012; Paris Agreement, 2015 ). This literature focuses mainly on green initiatives, practices or technologies adopted by large manufacturing or service firms (Dao et al., 2011 ; Park et al., 2010 ; Ranganathan et al., 2011 ; Wang et al., 2015 ; Whinkler, 2011 ; Zerbino et al., 2018 ), whereas in the field of logistics service providers (LSPs) there is not yet a structured framework (Centobelli et al., 2017 ; Maas et al., 2012 ; Zailani et al., 2011 ). This issue is crucial since the adoption of green initiatives by LSPs could play a pivotal role towards the achievement of environmental sustainability strategies affecting the entire supply chain. Freight transport and logistics industries generate tons of emissions every year and the implementation of sustainable and innovative means of transport plays an important role in pursuing green growth for sustainability and climate objectives. Previous studies demonstrated the role of freight transport and logistics industries in achieving SDGs (Mehmann and Teuteberg, 2015 ). In addition, the literature on the topic identifies specific green practices to support the adoption of environmental sustainability strategies, achieve the sustainable goals and proposes specific enabling technologies to support the green practices. However, the literature does not offer an exhaustive framework of the emerging green practices and technologies that could be adopted by LSPs. These topic areas are particularly important as nowadays the influence of technology on business activities is growing. Thus, in the era of digital transformation, managing technologies represents an unprecedented opportunity to support companies to adopt measures able to reduce emissions. Hence, the industry experts emphasized that a collaborative and digitized education and the realization of more applied researches would already be a good starting point when attempting to seek innovations for sustainable development and thus implement SDGs (Chin and Jacobsson, 2015 ; Gusmão Caiado et al., 2018 ). In addition, facing environmentally sustainable issues requires context-specific solutions to move toward a low-carbon economy. Starting from these premises, this paper aims to propose a taxonomy of emerging green practices and enabling technologies that could be adopted by LSPs to pursue environmental strategies and achieve sustainable development goals. To achieve this aim, it investigates the relationship between the degrees of diffusion of green practices and enabling technologies through an analysis conducted in a sample of British, German and Italian LSPs. The paper is structured in seven sections. After the introduction, in the second section the framework is described. The methodology is analysed in the third section. In the fourth section the context of investigation is presented. The main findings of field analysis are illustrated in the fifth section and discussed in the sixth section. Finally, conclusions and implications are discussed in the seventh section.  2 Framework Starting from the different definitions of green initiatives proposed in the body of the literature (Iacob et al., 2013 ; Lieb and Lieb, 2010 ; Maas et al., 2012 ; Perotti et al., 2012 ; Pieters et al., 2012 ), Centobelli et al. (2017)  proposed a novel definition of green initiative and developed a framework aimed to integrate the concepts of green practices, namely the set of specific organisational techniques and methods to achieve the sustainable goals, and enabling technologies, defined as the IT-based systems supporting green practices. This previous study proposed a taxonomy of LSP green practices (Table 1  ) and a taxonomy of LSP enabling technologies (Table 2  ). As for green practices, according to the conceptual schema proposed, two main categories have been identified: single-firm practices and supply chain practices. Furthermore, considering the specific service provided, LSP practices are divided into five sub-categories: transport practices, warehousing practices, logistics service practices, management practices, and supply chain management practices. LSP enabling technologies include transport systems, warehousing systems, logistics service systems, management systems, and supply chain systems. The above-mentioned taxonomies identified allow us to propose a novel conceptual framework on the sustainable development of LSPs (Fig. 1  ). An effective environmental sustainability program has to cover in the long term each of the three levels, i.e., environmental strategies, corporate execution, enabling technologies. When defining the environmental strategy, LSPs have to evaluate opportunities and impacts (as well as potential threats) of their environmental business model. Corporate execution works in two directions: inside the company and toward supply chain partners. Nevertheless, at this level, the environmental strategy defined is realized through the operations management founding elements of an LSP: a first relationship organization-process-methods, which defines the internal key elements of the company and outlines the structure and the way it provides transportation and logistics services taking into consideration internal single-firm practices adopted; a second relationship service-customer-other LSPs, which defines the external key elements of the strategy execution and leverages on supply chain practices involving other partners. At the bottom level, green practices are supported by a set of single-firm technologies and supply chain technologies. Despite technology is not the core of a green initiative, it is actually its enabler. In fact, technology supports the achievement of the corporate sustainable goals through the execution blocks represented by green practices. Therefore, technology is the enabler of the evolution of the operating environmental model. On the other hand, technology is the driver of changes on each level of the sustainable development pyramid, and being able to identify the impact of technology on each level of the pyramid is a key strategic corporate green capability. With these premises in mind, it is important to identify in logistics and freight transport industry the environmental changes driven by technology and define strategic responses or possibly anticipate changes with proactive environmental strategies. The above-defined three levels include the main building blocks of our framework: 1) the corporate sustainable goals, defined as objectives supporting environmental sustainability strategies; 2) the green practices, defined as organizational methods to support the corporate sustainable goals; 3) the enabling technologies, defined as technological solutions supporting the green practices. More in details, starting from the definition of a new environmental business model, without its execution inside the company and toward supply chain partners, is a pure theoretical exercise that will not change the environmental way an LSP performs. On the other hand, the adoption of a new technology (e.g., emission control system, environmental database system, environmental app) or the set-up of a standalone green practice is not a green initiative, if this is not part of an overall strategic and operating model transformation. Each of the three levels of the sustainable development pyramid has a strong influence on the other building blocks. In fact, a successful environmental sustainability program requires a systemic approach to embrace a green initiative. Strategy, execution or technology alone cannot transform the environmental behaviour of an LSP: only a systemic integration amongst the elements included in the different building blocks enables environmental transformation. Each of the elements is relevant and the relationship amongst the different elements must be taken into consideration in the adoption of green initiatives. Once presented the conceptual framework of this study, the next section presents the methodology through which the spread of the above-mentioned green practices and enabling technologies has been analysed.  3 Methodology A web-based document analysis methodology has been adopted to examine the spread of green practices and enabling technologies in a sample of European LSPs. This analysis was carried out from May 2015 until July 2017. As the internet is becoming a critical tool for sharing environmental initiatives (Coope, 2004 ; Guziana, 2011 ), there is an increasing amount of scientific research based on dissemination of green issues on the web (Eyun-Jung and Childers, 2006 ; Greer and Moreland, 2007 ; Sones et al., 2009 ; Tagesson et al., 2009 ). The methodological approach was conducted through a comprehensive review and content analysis of the websites of the LSPs investigated. Furthermore, information from complementary documents (e.g., LSP environmental reports, industry magazines) was collected and analysed. Two researchers analysed the websites and the complementary documents to investigate the presence or absence of information concerning the use of a specific green practice or a specific enabling technology included in the two above-mentioned comprehensive lists (Table 1  and Table 2 ). According to Centobelli et al. (2017) , the analysis is composed by the following six steps:1) Document search , in which LSP websites and other complementary documents are identified adopting specific keywords in various search engines, databases and websites (Labuschagne, 2003 ; Zhang and Wildemuth, 2005 )  2) Document selection , in which the documents of potential interest collected in a document management system (DMS) including a folder for each logistics service provider and analysed in parallel by two researchers (Labuschagne, 2003 ; Zhang and Wildemuth, 2005 )  3) Manual analysis , in which the two researchers have conducted the analysis described by Hsieh and Shannon (2005)  to examine the documents of interest selected. In this phase, a preliminary list of individual green practices and enabling technologies adopted by LSPs are collected in a database (Labuschagne, 2003 ; Zhang and Wildemuth, 2005 )  4) Computer-assisted analysis , in which each document of interest is further analysed using NVivo1  1 http://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx    software to calculate frequency of each item included in the two comprehensive lists of green practices and enabling technologies identified. A cross-examination is conducted using query functions for knowledge discovery and web mining (Laender et al., 2002 ; Zhang and Wildemuth, 2005 )  5) Confirmation analysis , in which the triangulated findings are confirmed and/or integrated by an interview conducted by telephone or audio/videoconference to ensure the reliability of findings (Angers and Machtmes, 2005 ; Bowen, 2009 )  6) Triangulation of findings , in which the findings of manual analysis (step 3), computer-assisted analysis (step 4), and confirmation analysis (step 5) are validated through cross-verification (Patton, 2002 ; Eisner, 1991 ; Angers and Machtmes, 2005 ; Bowen, 2009 )     4 Context of investigation Starting from the methodological premises illustrated above, the empirical analysis was carried out on a sample of 1275 LSPs belonging to three different European countries (Germany, Italy, United Kingdom). The selected LSPs meet the following three criteria (Zhu et al., 2007 ; Colicchia et al., 2013 ): 1) micro-, small-, medium- or large-sized firms, with their headquarters, or at least a branch, in Germany, Italy or United Kingdom; 2) firms that operate in different supply chains; and 3) firms that communicate their environmental sustainability strategies to their stakeholders on their websites or on environmental reports. 4.1 Germany In Germany, the analysis was carried out on a sample of 295 out of 798 LSPs listed in Bundesvereinigung Logistik (BVL) (Table 3  ). BVL, founded in 1978, involves companies and individuals from the worlds of industry, commerce, services and science who are actively involved in the business of logistics and supply chain management.  4.2 Italy The analysis was conducted in a sample of 402 LSPs listed in Confederazione Generale Italiana dei Trasporti e della Logistica (Confetra) , the largest Italian association of firms operating in the logistics service and freight transportation industry. Confetra , founded in 1946, currently comprises 544 LSPs and carry out a number of activities to support the associated firms. The analysis was carried out on a sample of 402 out of 544 LSPs listed in Confetra  achieving a response rate of 73.9% (Table 4  ).  4.3 United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the analysis was carried out on a sample of 304 out of 578 LSPs listed in British International Freight Association (BIFA), achieving a response rate of 52.6%. BIFA is the national association for UK-registered companies engaged in international movement of freight by all modes of transport, air, road, rail and sea (Table 5  ).   5 Results of cross-country analysis This section presents the main findings of the empirical analysis to identify the degree of diffusion of green practices and enabling technologies by European LSPs investigated. The main results regarding the diffusion in Germany, Italy and UK are used to carry out a comparison amongst the different countries. The degree of diffusion of green practices (enabling technologies) was defined as the number of LSPs adopting the specific green practice (enabling technologies) divided by the total number LSPs of the sample (295 in Germany, 402 in Italy, 304 in UK). It shows the percentage of LSPs using a specific green practice (enabling technology). The degree of diffusion ranges from zero, if no LSP operating in the country uses the specific green practice (enabling technology) to 100, if all the LSPs use the specific green practice (enabling technology). Green practices This paragraph presents a comparison amongst LSPs operating in the three countries investigated concerning the degree of adoption of green practices. Table 6   reports the results regarding the degree of adoption of single-firm green practices in Germany, Italy and UK. The following three points summarise the main findings of this analysis:1 German LSPs present the highest degree of adoption for 7 out of 14 single-firm green practices and never present the lowest degree of adoption for the mentioned practices;  2 Italian LSPs present the highest degree of adoption for 2 out of 14 practices, whereas they present the lowest degree of adoption for 12 out of 14 single-firm green practices  3 British LSPs operating in the United Kingdom present the highest degree of adoption for 5 out of 14 single-firm practices and the lowest degree of adoption for only 2 practices.    Concerning supply chain green practices, Table 7   shows the following main findings:1 German LSPs present the highest degree of adoption for 5 out of 6 supply chain green practices and never present the lowest degree of adoption for the mentioned practices  2 Italian LSPs present the highest degree of adoption for 1 out of 6 supply chain practices and 5 out of 6 present the lowest degree of adoption  3 British LSPs present the highest degree of adoption for 1 out of 6 supply chain green practices and the lowest degree of adoption for 2 practices.    In summary, as for Italian LSPs, the single-firm green practices with the highest degree of adoption support the phase of management, while the practices with the lowest degree of adoption support the phases of warehousing and logistics services. On the contrary, as regards the spread in the United Kingdom, the green practices with the highest degree of adoption support logistics services, while the green practices with the lowest percentage support the phase of transport. Finally, the green practices most adopted by German firms support mainly the logistics services provided, whereas the green practices with the lowest degree of adoption support the phases of transport and management. In addition, the results of this paper concerning supply chain green practices highlight a fairly homogeneous behaviour of British, German and Italian LSPs. These firms tend to adopt collaborative supply chain practices (e.g., coordinated logistics and transportation programs, collaboration with customers) instead of sharing supply chain practices (e.g., spread of information on carbon footprint, spread of information on greenhouse gas goals).  Enabling technologies This paragraph presents a comparison between LSPs operating in the three countries investigated concerning the degree of adoption of enabling technologies. Table 8   reports the percentage of LSPs adopting each single-firm technology. The following three points summarise the main findings:1 German LSPs presents the highest degree of adoption for 3 out of 12 single-firm technologies and present the lowest degree of adoption only for 2 out of 12 technologies  2 Italian LSPs present the highest degree of adoption for 4 out of 12 technologies, whereas they present the lowest degree of adoption for 7 out of 12 single-firm technologies  3 British LSPs present the highest degree of adoption for 6 out of 12 single-firm technologies and the lowest degree of adoption for 4 technologies.    Regarding the adoption of supply chain enabling technologies (Table 9  ) the following main findings emerge:1 German LSPs present the highest degree of adoption for 5 out of 12 supply chain technologies and present the lowest degree of adoption 3 out of 12 technologies  2 Italian LSPs present the highest degree of adoption for 1 out of 12 supply chain technologies and 9 out of 12 present the lowest degree of adoption  3 British LSPs present the lowest degree of adoption for 1 out of 12 supply chain technologies and the highest degree of adoption for 7 out of 12 technologies.    The single-firm technologies with the lowest degree of adoption support the phase of management for British, German and Italian LSPs. As regards the spread of supply chain technologies, British, German and Italian LSPs tend to assume a fairly homogeneous behaviour and tend to adopt collaborative supply chain technologies (e.g., customer relationship management systems, P2P resource sharing) instead of sharing supply chain technologies (e.g., content management systems, environmental apps, syndication systems).   6 Discussion of results The main findings presented in the previous sections show that German LSPs are more inclined to adopt green practices than Italian and British LSPs. On the contrary, British LSPs are more inclined to use a large number of enabling technologies. Italian LSPs are in the middle of these two opposite behaviours, but they are on average more inclined to adopt a lower number of both green practices and technologies. To identify similar and distinctive points emerging from the findings of cross-country analysis on the spread of green practices and enabling technologies, we defined, for each country (k ) and for each type of green initiative (t)  (i.e., single-firm and supply chain) or phase of the service (h ) (i.e., transport, warehousing, logistics service and management), a green practice spread index (GPS) and an enabling technology spread index (ETS), as follows:(1) G P S  ( k , t  )  = N u m b e r  o f g r e e n  p r a c t i c e s  a d o p t e d  b y  L S P s  ( k ,  t  )   L S P  ( k )    T o t a l  n u m b e r  o f  g r e e n  p r a c t i c e s  a v a i l a b l e  ( t )     ∀  k ,  t     (2) G P S  ( k , h  )  = N u m b e r  o f g r e e n  p r a c t i c e s  a d o p t e d  b y  L S P s  ( k , h  )   L S P  ( k )    T o t a l  n u m b e r  o f  g r e e n  p r a c t i c e s  a v a i l a b l e  ( h )     ∀  k ,  h     (3) E T S  ( k , t  )  = N u m b e r  o f  e n a b l i n g  t e c h n l o g i e s  a d o p t e d  b y  L S P s  ( k ,  t  )   L S P  ( k )    T o t a l  n u m b e r  o f  e n a b l i n g  t e c h n l o g i e s  a v a i l a b l e  ( t )     ∀  k ,  t     (4) E T S  ( k , h  )  = N u m b e r  o f  e n a b l i n g  t e c h n l o g i e s  a d o p t e d  b y  L S P s  ( k ,  h  )   L S P  ( k )    T o t a l  n u m b e r  o f  e n a b l i n g  t e c h n l o g i e s  a v a i l a b l e  ( h )     ∀  k ,  h     Where:t : type of green initiative (i.e., single-firm and supply chain) h : phase of the service (i.e., transport, warehousing, logistics service, and management) LSP (k) : total number of LSPs operating in the country k  For each type of green initiative t  and for each phase of the service h , the GPS index (1, 2) represents the ratio between the average number of green practices adopted by the LSPs operating in each country k  and the total number of green practices available (Table 10  ), whereas the ETS index (3,4) represents the ratio between the average number of enabling technologies adopted by the LSPs operating in each country and the total number of technologies available (Table 11  ). These indices range from 0 to 1. They are equal to 1 if all the LSPs belonging to each country adopts the entire set of green practices (enabling technologies) available for the specific type of green initiative (phase of the service). On the contrary, the indices are equal to 0 if there is no green practice (enabling technology) adopted by any LSP. As for single-firm green initiatives, the indices were evaluated for each country to investigate more in-depth each phase of the service provided (Table 12  ). The findings presented in Table 10 , Table 11  and Table 12  confirm that single-firm green practices are on average more adopted than supply chain green practices for LSPs operating in the three countries investigated. On the contrary, LSPs operating in Germany, Italy and UK tend to adopt supply chain technologies instead of single-firm technologies. As for the single-firm green initiatives, enabling technologies are on average more adopted than green practices in Italian LSPs, whereas British and German LSPs are focused on both practices and technologies. Analysing the findings for the different phases of service provided, enabling technologies supporting the phases of transport, warehousing and logistics services are more used than the green practices included in the corresponding categories for Italian LSPs. Despite also German LSPs are more focused on transport, warehousing and logistics services, these firms present a percentage higher than Italian LSPs in adopting the green practices. Therefore, German LSPs seem more aware than Italian ones of the necessity to develop a synergistic interaction between technological and organizational aspects. British LSPs are similar to Italian LSPs for the phase of warehousing, i.e., leveraging on enabling technologies, and similar to German LSPs for the phase of logistics services, in which these firms leverage on both technologies and practices to support their environmental strategies. On the contrary, British LSPs adopt mainly green practices in the phase of transport. Finally, the results highlight a fairly homogeneous behaviour of British, Italian and German LSPs in the adoption of green practices supporting both single-firm management and supply chain management activities. Concerning supply chain green initiatives, the results highlight an homogeneous behaviour of British, Italian and German LSPs that tend to adopt more enabling technologies than green practices. These firms tend to use collaborative supply chain practices (e.g. coordinated logistics and transportation programs, collaboration with customers) instead of sharing supply chain practices (e.g. spread of information on carbon footprint, spread of information on greenhouse gas goals).  7 Conclusions and implications The main aim of this paper is to contribute to propose taxonomy of emerging green practices and enabling technologies that could be adopted by LSPs to pursue environmental strategies and achieve SDGs. To achieve this aim, it investigates the relationship between the degrees of diffusion of green practices and enabling technologies through an analysis conducted in a sample of British, German, and Italian LSPs. Despite the paper has highlighted that affordable and scalable practices and solutions are now available to support companies to adopt measures able to reduce emissions and promote climate action goals, the concept of green initiative integrates three complementary perspectives: the sustainable goal (managerial perspective), the green practices (organizational perspective), and the enabling technologies (technological perspective). The main results of the cross-country analysis highlight that the LSPs operating in the different countries are not a homogeneous industry, but a variety of behaviours in terms of managerial and technological strategies for sustainable development emerges. The values of green practice spread index (GPS) and enabling technology spread index (ETS) highlight that single-firm practices present higher values than supply chain practices according to the GPS index. On the contrary, supply chain enabling technologies present higher values than single-firm enabling technologies according to the ETS index. More in details, German LSPs seem more inclined towards single-firm green practices instead of those regarding the supply chain. As for the enabling technologies, German LSPs have a consistent technological asset that could also support a higher degree of adoption of green supply chain practices. Concretely, this result shows that there is a technological potential that is still little used but that could make a leap in quality to the German LSPs orientated towards a wider adoption of green supply chain practices. As for Italian LSPs, the firms investigated show a low level of adoption of green practices both internal to the enterprise and those regarding the supply chain. Moreover, the green practices are focused on the phases of transport and management, whereas enabling technologies are focused on the phases of warehousing and logistics service. This aspect highlights that there is a misalignment between green practices and enabling technologies. This misalignment is even more relevant if we consider that Italian LSPs have a technological asset that could support a higher degree of adoption of green practices both internal to the enterprise and involving supply chain partners. From the point of view of British LSPs, these firms are more inclined towards single-firm practices instead of those regarding the supply chain. As for enabling technologies, they have a technological asset that could be of help to support a higher degree of adoption of green supply chain practices. Concretely, this result demonstrates that even in the case of British LSPs there is a technological potential, which, if better exploited, could facilitate a higher adoption of green supply chain practices. Therefore, the results of cross-country analysis highlight that as for green practices, LSPs of these three countries are more inclined to adopt single-firm green practices instead of those regarding the supply chain. On the contrary, LSPs of the three countries are more likely to adopt supply chain systems instead of single-firm systems. Even though LSPs of these three countries have a different degree of adoption for single-firm green practices and supply chain green practices, all three countries present a misalignment between green practices (meanly internal to the enterprise practices) and enabling technologies (more inclined towards supply chain systems). In practice, all three countries have a supply chain-orientated technology engine that could be better exploited to support supply chain green practices and overcome the misalignment. An additional comparative analysis shows a clear difference amongst the LSPs operating in the three countries investigated for the use of green practices and a fairly homogeneity in the adoption of enabling technologies. In fact, German LSPs are more inclined to adopt single-firm green practices than British and Italian ones. Even in the case of supply chain practices, German LSPs present a higher degree of adoption compared with UK and Italian ones. On the contrary, as far as the enabling technologies, the results show that German LSPs are more slightly inclined to use single-firm technologies than British LSPs and Italian ones. Furthermore, with regard to supply chain technologies, even in this case there is no real difference between the three countries. Although there are deep differences in the level of adoption of single-firm green practices (in Germany greater than in United Kingdom and Italy), the three countries present the same ratio between single-firm and supply chain green practices, and even in the case of enabling technologies, the results evidence the same conclusion. This means that the ratio between single-firm and supply chain technologies is the same for the three countries. This evidence highlights that the increase in the level of adoption of single-firm green practices (single-firm technologies) also increases the level of adoption of supply chain green practices (supply chain technologies). As an additional difference amongst the LSPs operating in the three countries, German LSPs have a higher inclination to use the single-firm green practices (with respect to single-firm technologies) than United Kingdom, which in turn has a higher propensity than Italy. The results highlight an even deeper difference concerning supply chain practices and technologies. In fact, Germany has also a higher inclination to use the supply chain green practices (with respect to supply chain technologies) than United Kingdom, which in turn has a higher propensity than Italy. In summary, considering that Germany has a degree of adoption of green practices (single-firm and supply chain) higher than United Kingdom that in turn has a degree of adoption higher than Italy, the analysis of results seem to suggest that the process of diffusion of green initiatives follows an evolutionary process characterised by a misalignment between the use of enabling technologies and the adoption of green practices, by an increasing ratio between green practices and technologies, and by a constant ratio between single-firm practices and supply chain green practices and between single-firm and supply chain technologies. These findings are even more relevant considering that logistics service providers are turning out to be third-party supply chain management providers for customers operating very often in different complex industries and adopting innovative technologies. Consequently, logistics service providers should dedicate resources to monitor the managerial and technological changes influencing other LSPs and the evolution of environmental sustainability strategies adopted by customers to develop a synergistic interaction between technological and organizational aspects, as well as to exploit the internet to disseminate online their best green initiatives. Future research and implications The conclusions indicate that the conceptual schema of sustainable development proposed in this paper could be utilized by individual LSPs as a guideline for the adoption process of enabling technologies and green practices to pursue environmental strategies and SDGs. Considering the misalignment problems identified between the enabling technologies and the green practices supporting specific phases of the logistics service, LSPs do not present a wide awareness of their pivotal role in offering an integrated service package that includes a complete set of logistics service activities and functional operations. As for the research implications, the findings of this research allow us to identify fertile ground for additional and empirical research at the intersection between the triple bottom line, the supply chain management and the circular economy field, which calls scholars to deepen how triple bottom line antecedents affect supply chain design and circular economy value proposition, as well as how the inclusion of circular economy principles in LSPs’ environmental strategies could support sustainable development goals. Furthermore, it emerges the necessity to analyse the alignment between the green initiatives adopted by LSPs and those employed by their customers. A third research direction deals with the need to provide a comprehensive taxonomy including the strategies of adoption of green initiatives by LSPs. This direction requires further investigation to examine whether the environmental sustainability strategy roadmap identified impacts on the performance of LSPs. As for the managerial implications, from the perspective of LSPs it emerges an implication regarding the opportunity to evaluate the impact of Industry 4.0 enabling technologies on the development of sustainable capabilities of individual companies and supply chains. Future studies should investigate how Industry 4.0 technologies can affect the use of green practices and a wide set of environmental sustainability performance (e.g., energy consumption, waste production, emissions, and recycling). On the other side, additional contributions should investigate how environmental and social sustainability practices adopted by LSPs are drivers of Industry 4.0 implementation, as well as to identify a set of critical success factors for environmentally-sustainable supply chains (e.g., management leadership, organizational readiness to change, top management commitment, strategic alignment, empowerment, organizational culture, and project management). From the customers’ perspective, LSPs may handle specific functions and activities to satisfy the customer's needs. To achieve these aims and address these needs, it emerges the necessity to develop direct communication flows between LSPs and customers. In this way, LSPs could learn the emerging sustainable practices from customers. From the technology providers’ point of view, it emerges the necessity to evaluate the potential benefits that enabling technologies can provide to LSPs, since the dissemination of good practices fosters the development of collective learning on sustainability, which in turn drives supply chains to implement these strategies. From policy-makers’ point of view, specific policies supporting the adoption of innovative practices and technologies are playing a pivotal role in assisting companies to achieve sustainable development goals. The results of this research suggest that specific different national policies should be identified to support the competitiveness of individual LSPs, local systems, and supply chains in the adoption of measures able to reduce emissions and promote climate action goals. Future research should investigate how European industrial policy measures to support environmental sustainability in logistics service providers could have different effects in different countries due to the similarities and the differences that characterise the adoption process of green practices and enabling technologies.
