                  A decrease in population is an emerging challenge in China's urbanization trajectory. This study utilizes data from the Sixth and Seventh Population Censuses to identify Chinese cities experiencing population decline, focusing on prefecture-level cities. It employs 30 indicators relevant to nine Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) concerning urban areas and populations to evaluate the progress of these shrinking cities in 2010 and 2020. A novel metric, "SDG population elasticity", is introduced to quantify the association between population reduction and SDG indexes. The study employs K-means++ clustering for 130 shrinking cities. The findings reveal that out of the 130 cities, 63 exhibit a downward trend in SDG index scores, predominantly in China's northeast and western regions. The Northeast region has negative SDG population elasticity, indicating a lag in sustainable development compared to that in other areas. Additionally, the research categorizes China's shrinking cities into four groups: cities with strong population elasticity feedback-significantly declining SDGs, cities with weak population elasticity feedback-slightly regressing SDGs, cities with high population loss-negative SDGs in decline, and cities with smart population decline-steady SDGs growth. These findings offer a foundation for crafting bespoke policies in shrinking cities to ensure a balanced approach to sustainable development and monitor advancement toward achieving the SDGs.

Handling Editor: Cecilia Maria Villas Bôas de Almeida A decrease in population is an emerging challenge in China's urbanization trajectory. This study utilizes data from the Sixth and Seventh Population Censuses to identify Chinese cities experiencing population decline, focusing on prefecture-level cities. It employs 30 indicators relevant to nine Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) concerning urban areas and populations to evaluate the progress of these shrinking cities in 2010 and 2020. A novel metric, "SDG population elasticity", is introduced to quantify the association between population reduction and SDG indexes. The study employs K-means++ clustering for 130 shrinking cities. The findings reveal that out of the 130 cities, 63 exhibit a downward trend in SDG index scores, predominantly in China's northeast and western regions. The Northeast region has negative SDG population elasticity, indicating a lag in sustainable development compared to that in other areas. Additionally, the research categorizes China's shrinking cities into four groups: cities with strong population elasticity feedback-significantly declining SDGs, cities with weak population elasticity feedback-slightly regressing SDGs, cities with high population loss-negative SDGs in decline, and cities with smart population decline-steady SDGs growth. These findings offer a foundation for crafting bespoke policies in shrinking cities to ensure a balanced approach to sustainable development and monitor advancement toward achieving the SDGs.

This agenda, supported by 193 member states, outlined 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Clark and Wu, 2016 ). These goals include a comprehensive array of economic, environmental, and social objectives to be attained by the year 2030 (Xu et al., 2020 ; United Nations, 2014 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). These SDGs taking into account the individual national circumstances and developmental stages of each country. These data collectively represent the developmental objectives and trajectories for nations worldwide by 2030. However, it has been shown that the relationship between them is complex, with both trade-offs and synergies (Nilsson et al., 2016 ). Therefore, it is difficult to realise all SDGs at the same time (Messerli et al., 2019 ). Monitoring and evaluating the progress of the SDGs from a scientific standpoint assume a pivotal role in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda . This undertaking serves the critical purpose of pinpointing priority areas necessitating improvement and the formulation of more precisely tailored policies and measures (Giles-Corti et al., 2020 ). Cities play a key role in addressing sustainable development. It is expected that by 2050, about 68.4% of the global population will live in urban areas. As a major gathering place for human beings, it continuously meets the basic needs of the urban population, maintains energy and land use intensity, ensures ecosystem integrity, responds to climate change, and diverse populations, subcultures, networks of interactions are also recognised as incubators of innovations, promoting economic productivity and social inclusion. Cities are considered to be the key to the successful implementation of the entire SDG agenda (Bai and Chen, 2023 ; Jacqueline and Danielle, 2017 ). However, rapid urbanisation brings a series of negative environmental and social problems such as increasingly prominent urban heat islands, traffic congestion, lack of basic services and facilities (Fang et al., 2016 ), cities face complex pressures and expectations. The principle of "think globally, act locally" for sustainable development in the context of globalisation is likely to be at the core of reflecting the self-worth and competitiveness of urban life (Wang and Peng, 2020 ). Recently, several scholars have assessed China's advancement toward the SDGs at diverse scales, including the national, provincial, and municipal levels. For instance, Xu et al. (2020)  evaluated China's SDG progress by examining both national and provincial dimensions from 2000 to 2015. Similarly, Wang et al. (2022)  utilized the constant elasticity of substitution model to assess China's spatial and temporal alterations in environmental sustainability, including the national and provincial spheres. Furthermore, Xu et al. (2022)  constructed a sustainable development assessment framework tailored to Shenzhen, evaluating the city's sustainable development trajectory spanning the years 2005–2019. The scale focuses mainly on the national and provincial levels, while research on the city level concentrates on specific city clusters and individual cities, with a lack of large-scale studies. There exist gaps in the integrated implementation of city-specific values, goals and solutions. Shrinking cities represent a distinctive urban phenomenon that often remains concealed amidst the backdrop of extensive urban expansion. In 1988, the German scholars Häußermann and W. Siebel (1988)  introduced the term "shrinking cities" to characterize urban centers that have undergone substantial depopulation. Since the 21st century, Western cities have increasingly encountered both population reduction and economic downturns (Camagni et al., 1986 ; Haase et al., 2016 ; Turok and Mykhnenko, 2007 ). Since the initiation of China's reform and opening-up policy in 1978, the nation's modern urbanization has achieved remarkable milestones in terms of urbanization, industrialization, and enhanced living standards (Liu et al., 2020 ; Chen et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless, since 2008, China's economy has experienced a shift toward a lower growth rate, influenced by global economic transformation. Concurrently, China's population distribution has undergone structural adjustments, with certain cities beginning to experience population declines, more and more cities face the challenge of shrinking (Liu, 2020 ). Research by Long et al. (2015)  revealed that from 2000 to 2010, 180 out of 654 Chinese cities at the county level and above experienced a decrease in population size and density, with significant population outmigration, particularly from the country's northeastern region. Shrinking cities have also emerged in economically developed regions such as the Pearl River Delta, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and Yangtze River Delta (Chen, 2021 ). This phenomenon engenders population decline, vacant housing, and underutilized public infrastructure, subsequently triggering various socioeconomic ramifications, including reduced investment, financial constraints, and altered land utilization. These factors, in turn, impede the realization of SDGs (Wu et al., 2015 , 2017 ; Meng et al., 2021 ). The conventional growth-driven urban development model has resulted in limited research on urban shrinkage in China, and there is a paucity of assessments regarding progress toward achieving SDGs in shrinking cities. SDG 11(Sustainable Cities and Communities), which aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable", covers a wide range of aspects of urban society, economy, environment, safety, etc., is able to provide a comprehensive picture of a city's level of sustainable development. In addition to SDG 11, SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 6(Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9(Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 12(Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 13(Climate Action), which are also relevant to urban development, some of the indicators in these targets can also serve for urban SDGs monitoring (Zhao et al., 2022 ; Jacqueline and Klopp, 2017 ). In light of these considerations, this paper constructs an SDG evaluation index system tailored to China's shrinking cities. It proceeds to evaluate the advancement of the SDGs in 130 shrinking cities between 2010 and 2020. To analyze the relationship between the extent of population decline and the SDG index score, this paper proposes the "SDG population elasticity" indicator. Additionally, the K-means++ method is applied to investigate variations in progress toward achieving SDGs across different categories of shrinking cities. This study contributes to the integration of SDGs with the actual conditions of Chinese cities, reveals the sustainable development status of China's shrinking cities, and lays the groundwork for the formulation of policies conducive to coordinated development.  2 Data and research methods 2.1 Data sources The significance of population censuses as a pivotal method for delineating regional population shifts is incalculable. Since its inception, China has undertaken seven national population censuses, amassing a substantial corpus of population data and information spanning various epochs. This trove of data has provided bedrock for population research and served as a cornerstone for shaping national development strategies and macroeconomic policies (Guo, 2020 ). Furthermore, commencing in the 21st century, China's regional development has undergone differentiation. The nation is traditionally categorized into four principal regions—the eastern, central, western, and northeast regions—based on natural conditions, economic underpinnings, developmental status, and the level of openness to external influences. This regional categorization facilitates the analysis of socioeconomic development, engendering healthy competition and promoting coordinated progress within and among these regions. Consequently, this paper takes the shrinking cities as defined by Wang et al. (2022)  based on the data from the sixth census (2010) and the seventh census (2020): cities with a negative rate of change in the resident population between the two census years. A total of 130 are studied (Fig. 1     ) . The formulation of the SDG evaluation index system for shrinking cities primarily draws upon various key documents, including the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  (UNSD, 2017 ), the 2018 Sustainable Development Goals Index and Dashboard report  (Sachs et al., 2018 ), and the United Nations report titled "Indicators and Monitoring Framework for the Sustainable Development Goals " (Schmidt-Traub, De La Mothe Karoubi E, & Espey, 2015 ). These reports present a rigorous and thorough quantitative methodology for evaluating SDGs at both the national and urban levels. This methodology has been widely adopted in various peer-reviewed publications. However, as different countries and regions have different socio-economic and natural backgrounds, although the United Nations has proposed corresponding targets and indicators for each goal, not all of these indicators are clear and available for scientific research (Cheng et al., 2023 ). This article refers to the literature related to the study of sustainable urban development in China (Zhao et al., 2022 ; Zhou et al., 2022 ), incorporates 30 indicators pertaining to SDGs 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13, which are closely related to urban development. To construct the evaluation system of SDGs for shrinking cities, considering standardisation, openness and accessibility of indicators, selects and replaces some indicators with those developed by Xu et al. (2020)  and Zhou et al. (2022)  in their study of China's comprehensive assessment of SDGs, finally identifies the changing status of SDGs in shrinking cities with different zoning. The data for the selected indicators are obtained from the China City Statistical Yearbook  and the China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook . The former is published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC), the latter is published by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China (Table 1 ).  2.2 Research methods 2.2.1 Quantifying progress towards SDGs in shrinking cities In light of the inherent disparity in the raw indicator data, which renders them incomparable, we performed normalization and transformed the data into a scale ranging from 0 to 100 following the methodology employed in the SDG Index and Dashboard report. Attributes of indicator changes are taken into account, including positive and negative. Positive attributes mean that the larger the data, the more favorable it is for sustainable development. Negative attributes mean that the smaller the data, the more favorable it is for sustainable development. Similarly, we identify upper and lower bounds for each SDG indicator to minimize the potential impact of skewed data distributions on normalised values during the normalization process. First, we used relevant absolute quantitative thresholds for some of the zero deprivation targets, such as "Proportion of the population without effective financial coverage for health care", "Unemployment rate in urban areas", "Coverage of urban population with access to piped water ". Second, the upper bound for all other indicators are set to the average of the top five values for each city. The lower bound are defined as the performance value of the penultimate sixth in the sorted array of SDG indicator values (one data point). The distribution of each indicator is examined so that all values above the upper limit are scored as 100 and those below the lower limit are scored as 0. Upon acquiring scores for each individual indicator, these scores undergo aggregation to yield scores for the corresponding SDGs, employing arithmetic averaging. These SDG scores are subsequently further amalgamated to derive the overall SDG score. Throughout the aggregation process, each indicator is assigned an equal weight, indicating uniform importance and negating subjective bias (Yin et al., 2023 ; Zhang et al., 2022 ). Additionally, we computed the changes in SDG scores by subtracting the standardized 2010 scores from the 2020 scores. Indicators with different attributes underwent separate normalization procedures following the prescribed formula:When  the  indicator  is  positive :  x  ′  = x − min  ( x )   max ( x )  − min  ( x )    × 100     When  the  indicator  is  negative : x ′  = max  ( x )  − x  max  ( x )  − min  ( x )    × 100     where x  is the raw data value for each SDG indicator and x ′     is the normalised individual score for a given SDG indicator.  2.2.2 SDG population elasticity The entire development and evolution of the concept of sustainable development has always revolved around population, resources and the environment. In 1981, Brown, the Director of the Worldwatch Institute of the United States, mentioned in his book Building a Sustainable Society  that controlling population growth, protecting the resource base and developing renewable energy are the three major ways to achieve sustainable development. According to Mr Tian, a Chinese scholar, "In the context of population, resources, environment and sustainable development strategies, sustainable development centers on addressing the relationship between population, resources and the environment for economic and social development, with population being the key (Bao & Dong, 2003 )". It can be seen the population effect is still the main contributor to the indicators of urban sustainable development goals (Zhou et al., 2022 ). The two can be both facilitating and inhibiting, for example, urban shrinkage is accompanied by environmental problems, the emergence of socio-economic problems, and subsequently a series of problems, such as housing vacancy, environmental degradation and so on. However, urban shrinkage does not absolutely lead to urban decay and a decline in the quality of life of residents, and some cities have rationalised the allocation of resources such as land, ecology and infrastructure in the process of population loss (Zhang and Li, 2017 ). Thus, a novel indicator is defined as "SDG population elasticity", denoted by the ratio of the rate of change in the SDG score to the rate of population change. This indicator serves the purpose of quantifying the connection between the population growth rate, which signifies the extent of population shrinkage in a shrinking city, and the rate of change in the SDG index score. The formula for calculating the population elasticity of SDGs is as follows:SDG  population  elasticity =  S D G  i n d e x  s c o r e  c h a n g e  r a t e  | D e g r e e  o f  p o p u l a t i o n  s h r i n k a g e  |          Negative SDG population elasticity values indicate a decrease in the SDG index score as the population shrinkages. This decline across economic, demographic, and social dimensions within the city signifies an unhealthy trajectory of urban growth, necessitating targeted attention and management, thereby representing a negative form of shrinkage. Conversely, when the SDG population elasticity value is positive, as the population diminishes, the SDG index score increases. Despite the reduction in population, the per capita socioeconomic standing of the city improved, aligning to some extent with the principles of "people-centered" new urbanization and characterizing a constructive trajectory for the shrinking region, often referred to as "smart shrinkage" (Liang and Wei, 2023 ). The magnitude of the absolute value of SDG population elasticity indicates the extent of its effect, with larger absolute values signifying greater elasticity and a more pronounced influence on the SDG index score. Assessing SDG population elasticity provides valuable insights into whether a city's population decline facilitates or hinders progress in realizing SDGs.  2.2.3 K-means++ clustering Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into two primary types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is commonly employed for tasks involving classification and prediction, while unsupervised learning is utilized for clustering. The objective of clustering is to group samples in a dataset based on their similarity, with the aim of minimizing intraclass differences while maximizing interclass distinctions. K-means, a classic unsupervised learning algorithm, relies on distance metrics for clustering. This approach follows a partitioning approach, starting by selecting a subset of objects from the dataset as initial cluster centers. Next, the similarity between all the data points and these initial centers is calculated, and each data point is assigned to the cluster represented by the most similar center. Subsequently, it computes new cluster centers and iterates through this process until the algorithm converges. However, the randomness inherent in the initial selection of cluster centers can lead to clustering results significantly different from the true data distribution and may result in slow convergence. To address this challenge, Arthur and Vassilvitskii (2007)  proposed the K-means++ algorithm, which enhances the method of randomly choosing initial cluster centers in K-means. In the context of this paper, the change in each SDG score serves as an indicator for cluster analysis. The classification results are subsequently combined to characterize the different categories of shrinking cities. The algorithm's steps are outlined as follows.①A sample is randomly selected from the dataset as the initial clustering centre C1.   ②Calculate the shortest distance Dx  between each sample and the existing clustering centre, calculate the probability that each sample is selected as the next clustering center, and finally select the next clustering center in accordance with the roulette wheel method:   Dx ∑ x ∈ X   Dx       ③ Repeat step ② until all the cluster centers are selected.  ④ Use the selected cluster centers for K-means clustering.     2.2.4 K-means++ clustering algorithm evaluation metrics The desirable clustering results should exhibit a minimal intracluster distance and maximal intercluster distance. In other words, minimal intracluster cohesion and maximal intercluster separation should occur. In this context, cohesion quantifies the proximity of samples within a cluster, while separation measures the dissimilarity between clusters. The silhouette coefficient method integrates both cohesion and separation aspects, serving as an evaluative tool to assess the efficacy of clustering. a  is the average distance of X i   from other samples in the same cluster and is the degree of cohesion; b  is the average distance of X i   from all samples in the nearest cluster and is the degree of separation. A value of S  closer to 1 means that sample i  is clustered more reasonably, a value closer to −1 means that sample i  should be classified into another cluster, and a value closer to 0 means that sample i  is on the boundary. The mean value of S(i)  for all samples is the contour coefficient of the clustering result.S = ( b − a  )  max ( a , b  )     S ∈ [ − 1 , 1  ]          3 Research results 3.1 Spatial and temporal distributions of SDG index scores for shrinking cities By categorizing the SDG scores into 11 distinct levels, this study reveals a more pronounced and fine-grained spatial distribution as well as temporal variations. In 2010, the average SDG score among shrinking cities was 45.80. Notably, Benxi city, located in Liaoning Province, had the lowest score at 31.53, while Huanggang city, in Hubei Province, had the highest score at 57.77, resulting in a substantial disparity of 26.24. Cities with higher scores predominantly cluster in the central and eastern regions. Specifically, the eastern region boasts the highest mean score at 51.14, followed by 46.40 in the central region and 44.69 in the western region, and the lowest score is recorded in the northeast region at 43.86. The maximum and minimum difference in scores among these four regions amounts to 7.28 (Fig. 2 ). In 2020, the average SDG score for shrinking cities slightly increased to 46.09 compared to the scores recorded in 2010. The lowest score is now observed in Hegang city, Heilongjiang Province, with a score of 25.43, which is notably lower than the minimum SDG score recorded in 2010, representing a decrease of 6.10 points. On the other hand, the maximum score is still held by Huanggang city, Hubei Province, with a score of 61.35, indicating a modest increase of 3.58 points. Cities with high SDG Indexes continue to be concentrated in the central and eastern regions. However, there were no high-scoring cities in the northeast region in 2020. The eastern region retained the highest index score, at 51.20, which was a slight increase of 0.06 points compared to that in 2010. It is followed by the central region with a score of 50.18, reflecting an increase of 3.78 points, and the western region with a score of 44.93, demonstrating a marginal increase of 0.23 points compared to 2010. Conversely, the lowest score persists in the northeast region, at 39.47; notably, this region is the only region where the SDG Index score has decreased, with a decrease of 4.39 points compared to that in 2010 (Fig. 3 ). The analysis revealed that out of the 130 shrinking cities, a total of 63 cities, constituting 48.46% of the overall city population, exhibited negative changes in SDG scores. These cities are primarily concentrated in the northeast and western regions. Notably, nearly all the shrinking cities in the northeast region, except Fushun and Benxi in Liaoning Province, experienced declines in their SDG index scores over the ten-year period. Furthermore, all the shrinking cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Hebei Province also experienced a decrease in their SDG index scores. Conversely, cities with increased scores are predominantly found in the central region (Fig. 4 ). The rankings of the four regions in terms of SDG index scores between 2010 and 2020 have remained consistent. The eastern region, as the region with the highest scores, has observed a marginal increase in its SDG Index score, with a growth rate of 0.11%. The central region has registered the most significant increase in its SDG Index score, showing a growth rate of 8.14%, gradually narrowing the gap with the eastern region. The western region, while displaying slightly lower scores, also exhibited slow growth, with a growth rate of 0.52%. However, the northeast region, characterized by the lowest SDG index score, has experienced a disconcerting decline of −10.01% over the past decade, posing a significant concern for sustainable development in this region (Fig. 4 ). Upon comparing the distributions of SDG index scores between shrinking cities in 2010 and 2020, a notable observation emerges: the maximum and minimum values of SDG index scores in 2020 surpassed those recorded in 2010. This signifies that during the population shrinkage process in this decade, disparities in the sustainable development of shrinking cities grew. While some cities, such as Huanggang city in Hubei Province, have shown improved performance, others, such as Hegang city in Heilongjiang Province, have experienced declines. In particular, there were four cities in 2020 that fell below the 2010 minimum values, namely, Hegang city in Heilongjiang, Tongliao city, Ulanqab city in Inner Mongolia, and Zhongwei city in Ningxia. These cities are situated in the northeast and the west. Conversely, four cities exceeded the 2010 maximum values in 2020, namely, Heyuan city in Guangdong, Zhumadian city in Henan, Huaihua city in Hunan, and Huanggang city in Hubei, which are located in the central and eastern regions. The amplified disparities in development among regions have accentuated the differences in the levels of sustainable development among shrinking cities (Fig. 5 ).  3.2 Changes in scores for each SDG In terms of distribution, except for the high values of SDG 11(Sustainable Cities and Communities) scores in 2010, which are mainly distributed in northeastern China, most of the high values of SDG scores are more likely to be distributed in central and eastern China, both in 2010 and 2020. In 2010, the best performer is SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), the worst performer is SDG 9(Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). In 2020, the best performer is SDG 12(Responsible Consumption and Production), the worst performer is SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), the regional differences between SDG 6(Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 11 and SDG 12 shrinking cities are narrowing (Fig. 6   ). However, by analysing the changes in the scores of the SDGs, we find that SDG 7, the best performer in 2010, has the most extensive and drastic decline over the decade. SDG 9, the worst performer, has improved considerably over the decade. China's pace of energy restructuring and clean-up has accelerated in recent years, with significant energy savings and emission reductions, but the situation in shrinking cities is not encouraging. The scores for six out of the nine SDGs improved, whereas the scores for the remaining three experienced a decrease over time. These declines, ranked from the most substantial to the least, pertain to SDG 7, SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 4 (Quality Education). Conversely, the three SDGs that demonstrated the most significant improvements, ranked from the most substantial to the least, were SDG 6, SDG 12, and SDG 9 (Fig. 7  ). Across the four regional levels, four out of the nine SDGs exhibit an increase in average score, including all nine SDGs, while three manifest a decrease in score across all nine SDGs. The four SDGs displaying ascending scores are SDG 6(Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 9(Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 11(Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 12(Responsible Consumption and Production), whereas the three SDGs registering decreasing scores are SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). This pattern mirrors the overall dynamics observed in shrinking cities. Notably, the northeast region consistently demonstrates the slowest progress or the most significant decline across all SDGs, except for SDG 6, where the highest growth in scores is recorded (Fig. 8 ).  3.3 SDG population elasticity In summary, the total number of cities exhibiting positive population elasticity is 67, while the number of cities displaying negative population elasticity is 63, resulting in a nearly equal distribution. Panzhihua city in Sichuan Province emerged as the best-performing city, boasting a population elasticity value of 164.98. The decline in population has alleviated the strain arising from the mismatch between population size and the coordinated development of resources and the environment, leading to more effective allocation and utilization of urban resources. Conversely, Zhongwei city in Ningxia ranks as the worst-performing city, with a population elasticity value of −22.78, intensifying the challenges associated with sustainable development in this region. Upon analyzing the four regions comprising shrinking cities, it becomes apparent that the average SDG population elasticities in the central, western, and eastern regions are all positive, with values of 1.24, 0.06, and 0.02, respectively. In contrast, the northeast region is the sole region characterized by negative SDG population elasticity, with a value of −0.59. Furthermore, except for the cities of Benxi and Fushun in Liaoning, all the other cities in this region exhibit negative values. Consequently, the northeast region should proactively implement measures to mitigate the adverse consequences of severe population shrinkage (Fig. 9 ).  3.4 K-means++ classification and feature analysis In this study, MATLAB was used to execute K-means++ cluster analysis. The contour coefficient can be used as an indicator of classification quality. As shown in Fig. 10    , when the number of categories is 2 or 4, the value of contour coefficient is higher. While in the case of two categories, due to the large number of cities in this article, which is not conducive to providing realistic guidance, therefore, according to the actual situation, we used the classification results of four categories of cases, so that the governmental agencies and participants can classify and apply policies. 3.4.1 First category of shrinking cities This particular category of shrinking cities exhibits the most limited distribution, comprising a total of 11 cities, which constitute 8.46% of all shrinking cities. Notably, the majority of cities in this category, specifically 8 cities, are concentrated in the western region, representing 72.73% of the total cities in this category. In contrast, the central and northeastern regions have only 2 and 1 city, respectively, while there is no representation in the eastern region (Fig. 11 ).  3.4.2 Second category of shrinking cities This category of shrinking cities is the most extensive, comprising a total of 56 cities, which represents 43.08% of the entire population of shrinking cities. These cities are dispersed across all four regions of the country. The western region hosts the largest number of cities within this category, totaling 19, followed by the central region, with 13 cities, and both the northeast and eastern regions, with 12 each. Remarkably, in the eastern region, 80.00% of the shrinking cities fall within this category. Notably, the provinces with the highest distributions in this category are Heilongjiang and Shaanxi, accounting for 12.50% and 10.70%, respectively, of the total shrinking cities in this category (Fig. 12 ).  3.4.3 Third category of shrinking cities Within this category, there are a total of 21 cities, constituting 16.15% of all shrinking cities. These cities are predominantly located in the northeast region of China, totaling 16 in this region. Specifically, Liaoning Province boasts the highest number within this category, with 7 cities, followed by Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces, housing 5 and 4 cities, respectively. Like in the first category, there is no representation of cities in this category in the eastern region (Fig. 13 ).  3.4.4 Fourth category of shrinking cities This particular category includes 42 cities, representing 32.31% of all shrinking cities. These cities are primarily concentrated in the central and western regions, comprising 25 and 13 cities, respectively. Notably, Sichuan Province boasts the highest number of cities within this category, totaling 9. In contrast, in the eastern and northeastern regions, only three and one cities, respectively, exhibit this type of shrinkage, and these cities are distributed sporadically (Fig. 14 ).  3.4.5 Analysis of the characteristics of four categories of shrinking cities K-means++, by incorporating a more intelligent initialization step into the K-means algorithm, enhances the likelihood that initial clustering centers are positioned at a distance from each other. This enhancement minimizes the chances of the K-means algorithm converging to a suboptimal solution. The goal is to maximize the disparity between classes and minimize the disparity within each class. Consequently, we employ the mean as a metric to signify the concentrated trend of progress toward a specific SDG within cities in the same category. Additionally, this approach aids in comparing variations in progress toward the SDGs among various categories of shrinking cities (Fig. 15      ) . The first category of cities experienced an average population loss of 183,400 individuals over the ten-year period, which represents the smallest population decrease among the four categories of cities. However, the "SDG population elasticity" for this category is −1.76, making it the poorest performer in terms of the effect of population shrinkage on sustainable development. Furthermore, this category exhibited the most substantial and uneven decline in SDGs, with an average SDG change score of −5.94 and a standard deviation of 24.97, the highest among the four categories. This category of cities shows negative growth in five out of the total number of SDGs in the indicator system, specifically in SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 13(Climate Action). Particularly noteworthy is the significant decline in SDG 7 scores in this category compared to the other three categories. The average score for SDG 7plummeted from 89.30 in 2010 to 18.11 in 2020, representing a staggering decrease of 71.19 points, with a rate of change of −79.72%. While all four categories of cities experienced declining average SDG 7 scores, this category's decline was nearly twice as severe as that of the third-ranked category. Cities in this category are primarily situated in the western region of China and benefit from abundant coal, oil, natural gas, and solar energy resources. However, they face a critical challenge in optimizing and adjusting their energy structures and achieving low-carbon and efficient energy use. On a more positive note, SDG 12(Responsible Consumption and Production) exhibited the most significant growth among the four categories, with an average SDG index score growth of 18.72 points, indicating effective environmental pollution management under the influence of new era technologies and concepts. Nevertheless, the progress in this category on SDG 12 lags considerably behind its performance on SDG 7, primarily due to inefficient energy production and substantial energy loss, making it the poorest-performing category in terms of sustainable development. Taking their characteristics into account, they are defined as cities with strong population elasticity feedback-significantly declining SDGs . In the second category of cities, the average population loss over the ten-year period amounts to 320,000, with an average rate of change of −8.95%. This category of residence is better than the third category of cities in terms of population decline, but it still faces significant challenges. The "SDG population elasticity" for this category is −0.11, indicating that population shrinkage has a relatively weak effect on the sustainable development of these cities. The decline in the average score for the nine SDGs in this category is relatively smaller, with a change score of −0.61 and a standard deviation of 9.84. The best-performing city in this category is Taizhou city, Jiangsu Province, with a score increase of 4.80, while the worst-performing city is Qiqihar city, Heilongjiang Province, with a score decrease of 8.06 points. Among the SDGs with negative growth in this category are SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Notably, the decline in the SDG 4 score was the most significant change among the four categories, with a change of −14.08 points. This decline reflects challenges in ensuring inclusiveness and equitable access to quality education in these cities. On the positive side, SDG 11(Sustainable Cities and Communities), which focuses on building inclusive, safe, disaster-resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements, exhibits improvement but still lags behind, with a 2020 score of 27.62, representing only a 2.54-point increase compared to that in 2010. This category performs well in SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 9(Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 12(Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13(Climate Action), ranking second among the four categories of cities in these aspects. Taking their characteristics into account, they are defined as cities with weak population elasticity feedback-slightly regressing SDGs . In the third category of cities, population decline is the most severe among the four categories, with an average loss of 433,400 people over the ten-year period and a high average population change rate of −16.82%. The "SDG population elasticity" for this category is −0.74, indicating that population shrinkage has a substantial negative effect on the sustainable development of these cities. The decline in the average scores for the nine SDGs in this category is significant and uneven, with a change score of −5.58 and a standard deviation of 16.88. Except for Longnan city in Gansu Province, which experienced a slight increase in its total SDG score, all the other cities in this category experienced varying degrees of decline in their total SDG scores. Notably, Hegang city, Heilongjiang Province, as well as Shuangyashan city and Tieling city, Liaoning Province, experienced the most significant decreases, with decreases of 13.671, 13.171, and 10.426 points, respectively. Like in the first category, cities in this category have negative SDGs, such as SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 13(Climate Action). However, they show positive progress in SDG 9(Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), which pertains to building resilient infrastructures, fostering inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and promoting innovation. Nevertheless, this category lags behind other regions in SDG 9, with an increase of only 1.85 points. Compared with those in the other three categories, the cities in this category significantly lag behind in SDG 8 and SDG 13. The average SDG 8 score decreased from 46.67 in 2010 to 23.82 in 2020, reflecting a rate of change of −48.96%. Similarly, the average SDG 13 score decreased from 60.52 in 2010 to 43.54 in 2020, representing a rate of change of −28.06%. This decline may be attributed to the lagging technological level of the economy and economic output, which results in a lower GDP growth rate than total carbon emissions, leading to a higher carbon emission intensity. Overall, the performance of this category of cities is better than that of the first category of cities. Taking their characteristics into account, they are defined as cities with high population loss-negative SDGs in decline . In the fourth category of cities, there is an average population loss of 282,300 people, which is comparatively better than that in the second and third categories of cities. Notably, the "SDG population elasticity" for this category is 1.98, making it the only category in which population shrinkage contributes positively to sustainable development, characterizing it as smart shrinkage. These cities are primarily concentrated within Sichuan Province in the central and western regions of China. The nine cities in this category have witnessed the most significant increase in their average SDG scores. In 2010, their average SDG score was second only to that of the second category of cities, with a score of 45.77. However, by 2020, they achieved a reversal, becoming the city with the highest average SDG score among the four categories, boasting a score of 51.84. This reflects a substantial change score of 6.07 and a standard deviation of 8.19, which are significantly greater than those of the other three categories of cities. All cities in this category witnessed an increase in their average SDG scores over the ten-year period. The best-performing city in terms of SDG score improvement is Huaibei, Anhui Province, with an increase of 12.92, while the worst-performing city is Shanwei, Guangdong Province, with an increase of 1.86. Among the SDGs, only SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) exhibited negative growth in this category, although they exhibited the smallest declines among the four categories of cities. Among the positive SDGs, SDG 12(Responsible Consumption and Production), which focuses on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, lags behind the others. SDG 6(Clean Water and Sanitation) also lags behind the second category of cities, while the remaining SDG growth changes are greater than those in the other categories. This suggests that while maintaining an optimistic outlook on sustainability, there is a need to upgrade technological tools to develop cleaner energy sources and ensure that the population size is compatible with available resources and the environment. Overall, this category of shrinking cities exhibits the best ten-year sustainable development performance. Taking their characteristics into account, they are defined as cities with smart population decline-steady SDGs growth .    4 Discussion 4.1 Characterization of SDGs in shrinking cities The study shows that along with the population loss during the decade, although the overall average SDG score does not change significantly (only 0.29 points were raised), however, the gap at the individual level is widening, there are better performing cities such as Huanggang City in Hubei with a score of 61.35, but there are also worse performing cities such as Hegang City in Heilongjiang with a score of 25.43, the inter-region is also polarized in the process of redistributing resource factors. The average SDG score of 35 cities out of 42 cities in the central region increased, only 2 cities out of 30 in the northeastern region had an increase in the average SDG score, which is the only category of the region with a decrease in the SDG index score. Factors contributing to this regional divergence include the rapid development of modern transport infrastructure and "east-central integration," which have boosted central China's rise. Conversely, despite the implementation of the Northeast China Revitalization Strategy in 2003, the northeast has faced challenges in industrial transformation since 2013. Over-reliance on investment to stimulate economic growth leads to economic difficulties, affects demographic shrinkage and sustainable development, exacerbates regional development disparities (Zhang, 2018 ). Of the nine SDGs, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), which is related to clean energy, was the best performer in 2010, but all four districts have declined in score over the decade. And both SDG 3(Good Health and Well-being), 9(Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), 11(Sustainable Cities and Communities), which are growing, SDG 4(Quality Education), 8(Decent Work and Economic Growth), which are declining, have very poor scores (around 20–30 points), requires an in-depth exploration of solutions for improving the sustainable and balanced development of shrinking cities.  4.2 Opportunities and challenges facing SDGs in shrinking cities 130 cities in China are currently experiencing population shrinkage, accounting for 44.37% of the total prefecture-level cities in the country. Through an exploration of changes in urban population elasticity and SDGs, the study reveals that 67 cities have improved their level of sustainable development, while 63 cities have experienced a decline in sustainable development over the ten-year period coinciding with population shrinkage. The number of cities experiencing improvement and decline is nearly balanced. While dynamic changes in population inevitably alter the development patterns of urban resources and the environment, these changes are not necessarily detrimental. Some cities experience congestion due to an initially large population. Population outflow can relieve pressure on resources and the environment, facilitating the optimization of the allocation of urban resource factors and achieving "smart shrinkage" (Edwards, 1990 ). However, in cases where population loss results in multidimensional economic, demographic, and social decline, sustainable development is severely compromised, leading to a negative recession that demands prompt intervention.  4.3 Coping strategies for the sustainable development of shrinking cities in China To gain a better understanding of China's shrinking cities and inform policy-making, this study employs the K-means++ clustering method to classify these cities. Across all four categories of cities, a common challenge is the significant decline in scores for SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) over the ten-year period. The SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) is closely linked to renewable energy production and utilization. The decline in this indicator may be attributed to resource depletion and the challenges faced by resource-based cities within the group of shrinking cities, which have led to structural crises. In 2013, the State Council of China issued the "National Resource-Based Cities Sustainable Development Plan (2013–2020)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Plan"), which identified 262 resource cities, including 126 at the prefecture level. Notably, 66 of the identified shrinking cities are located within this plan, particularly those in the northeastern and western regions of China. Addressing this situation may involve transforming industrial and energy structures to reduce the crude consumption of energy. In the Cities with strong population elasticity feedback-significantly declining SDGs and Cities with high population loss-negative SDGs in decline, which are mainly concentrated in the western and northeastern regions, SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 13(Climate Action) have seen declines. These areas are characterized by ecological fragility, low ecological carrying capacity, and a concentration of heavy industries such as iron and steel and coal. The presence of "high carbon" energy and industrial structure has resulted in significantly higher total carbon emissions and carbon intensity. Achieving progress in SDG 13(Climate Action) necessitates addressing these challenges. China's pursuit of carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals has particularly impacted its traditional energy advantages. Prolonged setbacks in energy and raw material-dependent industries will intensify the challenges of transitioning to more sustainable practices, making carbon reduction efforts even more demanding. Achieving effective CO2  emission reduction will require economies of scale (Wang and Dou, 2023 ; Zhou and Liu, 2016 ; Zhou et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, characteristic issues have been identified for each category of cities. Combining insights from the literature and local research in China, the following recommendations are proposed: Cities with strong population elasticity feedback-significantly declining SDGs are located predominantly in western China, and despite experiencing relatively little population loss, they exhibit the weakest sustainable development performance among the four categories of cities. The consistent decline in SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) scores over the past decade highlights several key issues: a development model reliant on unsustainable energy sources exacerbates environmental vulnerabilities in these regions. Moreover, increasing resource intensity, dependence on fossil fuels, and sluggish technological advancements pose significant challenges to both environmental performance and human well-being. Sectors such as wind power, as potential replacement industries, have not yet expanded sufficiently to absorb surplus labor. Additionally, transitioning workers may struggle to adapt to new job requirements, leading to difficulties in reemployment and labor outflows. Addressing these challenges necessitates the development of effective energy production technologies, harnessing the potential of clean energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, and hydropower), establishing multilevel cooperation between the government and coal and electric power firms (Wang and Dou, 2023 ), and strengthening regional collaboration and technical support from more developed areas to facilitate technological upgrades aimed at reducing fossil fuel consumption. Prioritizing the restoration of ecological and natural environments is essential for implementing sustainable development strategies from economic, urban, and livelihood perspectives (Song, 2018 ). Cities with weak population elasticity feedback-slightly regressing SDGs experienced a more pronounced decline in population, accompanied by a notable decrease in SDG 4 (Quality Education) scores. They transitioned from holding the foremost position at the commencement of the period to occupying the third position at its conclusion. The allocation of funding for basic education typically exhibits a strong correlation with the regional economic development level. Furthermore, students hailing from different geographical regions encounter varying prospects for accessing higher education. Developed regions in the eastern part of China enjoy a distinct advantage over their counterparts in the western and central regions (Bickenbach and Liu, 2013 ; Shen, 2007 ), Consequently, the distribution of educational institutions, specifically colleges and universities, across China reveals a spatial pattern of "more in the southeast, less in the northwest" (Liu, 2015 ; Hannum and Wang, 2006 ). These more economically developed regions offer superior educational conditions, thereby ensuring the region's capacity to absorb its population. Simultaneously, they contribute to technology accumulation and foster research and development experiences conducive to scientific and technological innovation (Liang et al., 2021 ). To address these challenges, cities in this category should increase investments in education, allocate a percentage of funds to low-income families in remote areas, invest in lifelong learning opportunities, foster cross-border cooperation, promote digital transformation in education, and integrate education for sustainable development into the mainstream education system (United Nations, 2022 ). A comprehensive approach should be taken to address infrastructure support issues in towns and cities and the slow development of social services. Cities with high population loss-negative SDGs in decline located mainly in the northeast region of China, face the most severe population loss among shrinking cities. As an essential industrial base in China, this region has experienced the challenge of transitioning from rapid industrialization to the "new normal". The region has a high investment rate and low economic efficiency, compounded by the loss of industrial development dividends and declining resource advantages. These cities are concentrated in heavy industries such as iron and steel and coal and are characterized by a "high-carbon type" energy structure (Yang et al., 2021 ). The most significant decline is observed in SDG 13(Climate Action). To revitalize such cities, it is crucial to expedite the establishment of a robust modern energy system, promote the integrated development of multiple energy sources, enhance power grid infrastructure construction and intelligent upgrades, increase the share of tertiary industry, and reorganize high-energy-consuming industries within the secondary sector. Additionally, preferential measures in employment, housing, and social security should be implemented to improve employment conditions, attract local university graduates, and introduce talent to drive technological innovation, thereby providing robust institutional support for the revitalization of these cities. Cities with smart population decline-steady SDGs growth represent the best performing category among the four, and notably, population shrinkage has contributed to their sustainable urban development. These cities achieved positive results in all categories of SDGs except for SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Moreover, they serve as a positive example of countering negative perceptions of population loss. The shrinkage experienced by these cities is adaptable, and they can strategically relinquish demographic dividends when appropriate. They actively adjust their urban structures and pursue distinctive development paths. These cities continuously optimize the balance between population size and urban development, implementing predictable and flexible planning strategies for growth and decline. This approach facilitates the optimal allocation of resource elements, enabling these cities to achieve sustainable development. They also promote regional cooperation, fostering mutual support and common development among cities and regions (Wu, 2021 ).  4.4 Deficiency and prospect Evaluating the advancement of SDGs in shrinking cities is vital for monitoring the achievement of SDGs in the context of population decline. However, the localization of sustainable development in China is in a process of constant awareness and exploration, there are huge challenges in narrowing down the goals and targets to the city level. Although the United Nations has proposed targets and indicators for each goal, not all of them can be specifically applied at all levels of national administration, for example, SDG17 (Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partner ship for Sustainable Development) can be achieved between countries, but it is difficult to evaluate at the provincial and municipal levels. There is still a need to strengthen the collection of data on indicators, and certain ones that are difficult to conduct surveys should develop alternative indicator systems, consider incorporating geospatial information into the monitoring and evaluation of the sustainable development goals to meet greater applicability. At the same time, subject to the differences in geography, climate and humanities of cities, the government and researchers should consider establishing a strong city-scale data collection organization for cities of different sizes, attributes to tap into their key sustainability strengths and support the long-term sustainable development of the place. In the future, after complementing the above shortcomings, we can also continue to narrow the scale of our research by assessing shrinking county cities, hollowed-out villages and towns, conduct this kind of dispersed, diversified and individualized sustainability research in the context of shrinkage.   5 Conclusion By constructing an evaluation index system for SDGs in diminishing urban areas, this research assessed the progress toward SDGs in 130 cities experiencing population declines in 2010 and 2020. The results substantially enhance our understanding of the sustainability status of these cities, leading to the following principal conclusions.(1) The aggregate SDG index score for cities with diminishing populations rose marginally from 45.80 in 2010 to 46.09 in 2020, indicating a slight enhancement in their sustainable development. Nonetheless, 63 of these cities, representing 48.46%, exhibited a decline in their SDG score, with a concentration in the northeast and western regions.  (2) Regional disparities in sustainable development have become pronounced over time. The eastern region exhibited the most favorable development trajectory, while the northeast region showed lagging sustainable development, characterized by the only negative elasticity in the SDG population.  (3) Utilizing the K-means++ clustering method, these cities were categorized into four distinct groups based on their sustainable development performance, ranging from most to least favorable: cities with smart population decline-steady SDGs growth, cities with weak population elasticity feedback-slightly regressing SDGs, cities with high population loss-negative SDGs in decline, and cities with strong population elasticity feedback-significantly declining SDGs. A common challenge across all categories is high resource intensity and fossil fuel dependency coupled with sluggish technological advancement. These factors impede progress in SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), underscoring the ongoing challenge of reducing carbon emissions.
