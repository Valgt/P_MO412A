               Algae and cyanobacteria are alternative renewable sources of bioenergy. Appertaining to their fast growth and fewer nutrient requirements, round-the-year cultivation in barren lands with wastewater is considered suitable over other energy crops. With the growing demand for fuels in various sectors, bioenergy like biodiesel, bioalcohol, biohydrogen, methane, and bio-crude (product of pyrolysis/hydrothermal liquefaction) is derived from algae/cyanobacteria as a support to other energy sources. Phycoremediation or bioremediation by algae/cyanobacteria is one of the most effective biological wastewater treatment processes. Algae/cyanobacteria are cultivated in effluents with high inorganic/organic loads from different industries like poultry, slaughterhouses, paper, textile, distillery, “supercritical water gasification”, produced water (while extracting nonrenewable oil/gas) landfill leachate, etc. Biomass for bioenergy integrated with phycoremediation provides techno-economic effectiveness of practical commercialization and sustainable energy production. It contributes to climate change alleviation, reducing competition with crop irrigation, carbon, and water footprint. Phycoremediation is useful in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage based bioenergy production while reducing the water footprint. In the biorefinery approach, the recycled wastewater cultivation medium is further reused for developing biomass for biofuel and coproduct development like feed, pharmaceuticals, pigments, lubricants, biochar, polysaccharides, bioplastics, biofertilizers, etc. While “water recycling” is imperative to essentially reduce “blue water footprint,” the recycled medium also contains different growth promoters and inhibitors. Microalgae cultivation is related to sustainable development goals (SDGs) about the environment (water, land, biodiversity, greenhouse gases), economy (energy, investment, industrialization), and social base (awareness, education). Biofuels (1st/2nd/3rd/4th) from all generations provide clean energy (SDG 7). Also, biofuel generation using wastewater is directly related to SDG 6/7/12/13. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the different aspects of phycoremediation in biomass production and reuse strategies of wastewater to reduce water footprint in relation to SDGs during bioenergy generation from algae/cyanobacteria.

Appertaining to their fast growth and fewer nutrient requirements, round-the-year cultivation in barren lands with wastewater is considered suitable over other energy crops. With the growing demand for fuels in various sectors, bioenergy like biodiesel, bioalcohol, biohydrogen, methane, and bio-crude (product of pyrolysis/hydrothermal liquefaction) is derived from algae/cyanobacteria as a support to other energy sources. Phycoremediation or bioremediation by algae/cyanobacteria is one of the most effective biological wastewater treatment processes. Algae/cyanobacteria are cultivated in effluents with high inorganic/organic loads from different industries like poultry, slaughterhouses, paper, textile, distillery, “supercritical water gasification”, produced water (while extracting nonrenewable oil/gas) landfill leachate, etc. Biomass for bioenergy integrated with phycoremediation provides techno-economic effectiveness of practical commercialization and sustainable energy production. It contributes to climate change alleviation, reducing competition with crop irrigation, carbon, and water footprint. Phycoremediation is useful in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage based bioenergy production while reducing the water footprint. In the biorefinery approach, the recycled wastewater cultivation medium is further reused for developing biomass for biofuel and coproduct development like feed, pharmaceuticals, pigments, lubricants, biochar, polysaccharides, bioplastics, biofertilizers, etc. While “water recycling” is imperative to essentially reduce “blue water footprint,” the recycled medium also contains different growth promoters and inhibitors. Microalgae cultivation is related to sustainable development goals (SDGs) about the environment (water, land, biodiversity, greenhouse gases), economy (energy, investment, industrialization), and social base (awareness, education). Biofuels (1st/2nd/3rd/4th) from all generations provide clean energy (SDG 7). Also, biofuel generation using wastewater is directly related to SDG 6/7/12/13. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the different aspects of phycoremediation in biomass production and reuse strategies of wastewater to reduce water footprint in relation to SDGs during bioenergy generation from algae/cyanobacteria.   Keywords Algae  cyanobacteria  biofuel  wastewater  water footprint  phycoremediation  recycle  sustainable development goals   16.1 Introduction 16.1.1 Algae and cyanobacteria  Algae are photosynthetic, oxygenic, unicellular/multicellular, microscopic/macroscopic, and ubiquitous eukaryotic thallophytes in habitats with essential moisture/nutrients. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes (gram-negative) and can adapt to very harsh freshwater/marine (brackish/hypersaline) and terrestrial climates. The cyanobacteria are diverse microorganisms that are autotrophic/heterotrophic, colorless/pigmented, unicellular/multicellular, coccoid/unbranched/branched filaments, acidophilic/alkalophilic, psychrophilic/thermophilic, planktonic/benthic and periphytic/endophytic. Algae/ cyanobacteria are valuable in several ways like global aquatic primary biomass production (40%) and different biotechnological applications for food/feed, drugs, biofertilizers, phycoremediation (bioremediation by algae/cyanobacteria), biofuel, etc.1,2   Algae are phototrophic and do not require organic nutrient sources for their growth. However, a few are mixotrophic and can utilize both inorganic/organic nutrients in the presence/absence of sunlight.3   Macroalgae in the sea/ocean are mostly known as seaweed. The group is multicellular, photosynthetic, comprising of blade/lamina, stipe with holdfast in their structure, and widely distributed in coastal and ocean water.4   Macroalgae have low lipid content; however, due to the presence of high carbohydrate content, they are useful for bioalcohol production. However, the accumulation of carbohydrates is limited to the season, as presented in Laminaria digitata .4,5    16.1.2 Biofuels from algae and cyanobacteria Biofuels are the energy acquired from biomass and include all materials originating from biological sources except materials from geological formations transformed into fossil energy sources.6   Biofuel demand had increased since the global fuel crisis during the early 1970s.7   “Global biofuel production” has been estimated to be increased fivefold, driven by the factors like energy security, climate change alleviation, foreign exchange savings, and rural development.6,8,9   Globally, the energy requirement is projected as 780 exajoules by 2035 from 522 exajoules in 2007.10,11   In India, transit requires 27% of primary energy, with an annual oil consumption of 5.5%, increasing in each decade.11,12   Fossil fuels are unsustainable, nonrenewable, and cause global impact by producing NOx, SOx, VOCs, petroleum derivatives, dust, etc.13,14   It causes an impact on the environment through global warming, acid rain, and the decline in soil productivity, and alters the quality of surface/groundwater.14   In bioenergy production, sustainability is primarily concerned with risks/benefits for natural systems, societal development, and climate change.15,16   Bioenergy is intrinsically related to “sustainable development goals” and must be applied as a drive for development. Bioenergy mitigates global climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions.17   Algae remove CO2  from industrial emissions and contribute to achieving the most important “sustainable development goals.”18   Microalgae are considered to be a viable feedstock for biofuels appertaining to the high growth rate, carbon neutrality, lipid content, round-the-year availability of biomass, ability to grow in wastewater, and seawater with unrequired fertile land. A few microalgae contain oil of about >80% of DW.11   However, at present algal/cyanobacterial biofuel industry is unable to compete with conventional nonrenewable  fossil fuels about economic viability.19   Cyanobacteria, including Nostoc  sp., was isolated from a reservoir with a lipid content of 12%–26% with a growth rate of 0.18–0.23 days−1 .20   Although it has been emphasized to increase the lipid accretion in cells to reduce the cost, the strategy leads to a decrease in biomass productivity. This limitation can be overcome by the “thermochemical conversion” processes, where the nonlipid fraction (protein, carbohydrates, etc.) can be converted into biofuel.21   In hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), the gas phase largely contributed by the CO2  can be reused for algal/cyanobacterial biomass production. Also, HTL is a preferred process in bio-oil conversion due to the excess moisture in algal/cyanobacterial biomass. Further, the produced bio-oil is transformed into different chemicals and fuels.4   “Hydrothermal carbonization” (<200°C) and “hydrothermal gasification” processes (>375°C) lead to the generation of biochar and biogas. Also, biofuel production promotes economic upliftment in rural areas of developing countries with almost zero emissions of harmful gases.22    16.1.3 Water demand in algal/cyanobacterial biofuel production Freshwater is limited to the earth’s surface. Sustainable development is restricted by secured water resources.23   A population of ~2.3 billion is deprived of basic water resources. Bioenergy from algae utilizes a large amount of freshwater and fertilizers. For the production of biodiesel of 1 billion gallons, a total of 1,238 billion gallons of freshwater was required.24   Also, for 1 L of biodiesel (algal), 3000 L of freshwater was required. This high freshwater requirement with energy and material inputs in biofuel processing reduces the economic credibility of algal biofuels.25   A “global water deficit accompanies water demand.” The water deficit has been accelerated by the factors like economic development, changing consumption patterns, population growth, climate change, etc.6   Of the entire wastewater (municipal/industrial), at least 72% of wastewater was untreated in “lower-middle-income” countries and increased by 92% in “low-income countries.”26   The projection estimates that if the current utilization is unchecked, it will be about 40% of the global water deficit by 2030.3   Although recyclability reduces water demand, algal/cyanobacteria biomass production is often reduced by the presence of toxic substances, particulate matter, unassimilated ions, and high alkalinity during postharvest.27   Therefore, reusing recycled water requires understanding the development of unused nutrients, salinity, allogenic, and other organic matters. During cultivation, water loss occurs through evaporation and drying.27   Bio-alcohols like ethanol are derived from corn, which requires a large quantity of water and land. In the United States, 2/3rd of groundwater is used for  irrigation purposes, including corn. More water was required for cultivation rather than bioethanol conversion.28   Wastewater discharge is also increasing with industrialization, and agricultural and urban activities, leading to eutrophication with great concern. Although various governmental organizations have adopted a circular economy, a fit-for-purpose approach is essential for reducing production and energy cost appertaining to wastewater treatment.3,29   The process would also benefit the water recycling associated with water reuse/savings at a reduced cost.3,29,30   Conventionally, wastewater treatment encompasses high energy input, GHG emissions, wastage of recyclable resources, and excessive solid landfilling. However, excessive landfilling has been reduced by the bioenergy production techniques like pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and HTL. Algae/cyanobacteria-derived biofuels are the third/fourth generation biofuels with high growth rates requiring no fertile land. However, countries still rely on first-generation (food crops) biofuel.7   Microalgae/cyanobacteria can be cultivated/harvested around the year, which promotes its availability for biofuel production irrespective of seasons. In wastewater, microalgae reduce pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and remove pesticides, toxic substances, pharmaceutical wastes, excessive nutrients, etc. Reusing water in a biorefinery is important for sustainable algal/cyanobacterial product development and a crucial reduction of cost.25,31   A greater success rate has been attained in biomass production by reusing medium, but it still requires optimized water use and cost alleviation in biofuel generation.31,32   Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the “phycoremediation” of wastewater and “water footprints” for biomass and biofuel generation from algae/cyanobacteria with strategic recycling and reusing water in a medium with its contributions to achieve the UN’s “sustainable development goals.”   16.2 Water requirements in algal/cyanobacterial biomass production 16.2.1 Water footprint in biomass production Water footprint (WF) is the freshwater required at the actual production place.33,34   However, the “actual water” requirement is less than the WF. WF can be categorized into three components, viz. green WF (evaporated rainwater through crop growth), blue WF (surface/groundwater required for irrigation), and gray WF (polluted water generated during production). WF is associated with the family of “environmental footprints.”23,35   Green WF is not generated by microalgae cultivation for biofuel, while it produces a large amount of blue WF.6   Blue WF (except  sea/brackish water) does not reoccur in its water source, being unavailable for other uses.23   Gray water is stated as the quantity of water required for diluting the pollutants discharged into the aquatic to keep the water quality above the permissible water quality standards.34   WF is determined by two different approaches, viz. “volumetric water footprint” and “impact-oriented footprint.”23,36   WF greatly varies with the type of biomass cultivation, the process of cultivation, and climatic conditions. Also, WF for “nonrenewable energy” increases in the order of uranium>natural gas> coal> crude oil. WF for biomass is 70–400 times higher than is required for nonrenewable sources.34   It also raises the conflict between water for “food” and “energy.”  16.2.2 Production of algal/cyanobacterial biomass A total of “one metric ton” of water is indispensable to produce 1 kg of algal biomass.25,37   Also, photosynthesis causes great water loss (5–10 kg) for biomass (1 kg DW) production. To produce 1 kg of fresh biomass, 200 kg of “non-cellular” water is required.25,38   For biomass production for biofuel, the direct demand for water is calculated as the difference between water required for energy crop cultivation and annual precipitation.25,39   Climatic conditions, solar radiation/photosynthetically active radiation, wind velocity, water temperature, relative humidity, and cloud cover also impact algal biomass. The arid region (6.39 m3 /m2 /year) requires more water than the tropical zones (4.59 m3 /m2 /year). Although low temperature reduces water evaporation, it adversely affects the algal/cyanobacterial growth rate depending on the strains. Notably, the requisite cultivation area for biomass is less for highly productive strains with more lipid contents. The increasing population demands more biomass for commercial energy production. It is projected to be increasing to 157–304 EJ/year (2100) from 47 to 123 EJ/year (2050) at a rapid rate.40   Microalgae are cultivated in different modes like open, closed, and integrated systems.41   The water in a cultivation pond is the total water from the inoculum pond, water that remained on harvest, and water newly added.38   The energy required for pumping freshwater to a pond of volume 1.00 m3 /m2 /year is 1.43 MJ/m2 /year. Also, the presence of an “impermeable boundary” is important to check algae and nutrient medium loss. Water facilitates nutrient uptake, thermal regulation, and waste removal. Collective microalgae cultivation with wastewater treatment increases water quality and supports revenue generation with a sustainable circular economy.41   The Mediterranean Sea coastline is the most preferable for on-site marine algal cultivation. Southern Mediterranean Sea drops its temperature very low (not below 15°C). Appertaining to the presence of unused deserts and the warm temperatures of the ocean,  countries like Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia are preferable for algal cultivation.25,42   A few countries like Libya, Cyprus, and Turkey have necessary environments like unused land, temperature, and sunlight. However, algae cultivation on these lands is limited by the presence of water. Biofuel generation impacts aquatic bodies like rivers, lakes, aquifers, etc.43   Biomass production in recycled medium reduces WF and nutrient requirements.44   However, growth is often limited by the inhibitory factors present in the used medium. WF is more for microalgae (31,361 m3 ) than the widely used energy crop Jatropha curcas  (5787 m3 )/ton biodiesel production. However, the WF decreases by cultivating in wastewater/saltwater/brackish water. A reused medium is useful in reducing freshwater (84%) and nutrient demand (55%) as well.44,45   Industrially, water reuse is essential for economic viability and sustainability.2   Algae/Cyanobacteria are the “bioenergy with carbon capture and storage” (BECCS) and decrease global warming (1.5°C by 21st century). The technology for bioenergy from algae/cyanobacteria is a “negative emissions technology.” However, biomass production still requires plenty of water.46   Land use patterns, climate, and irrigated biomass plantations also influence the BECCS. Biomass cultivation in a photobioreactor (PBR) reduces water evaporation. However, the generated heat may reduce productivity.47,48   Water spraying, evaporative cooling, and water tank immersions could be useful as heat exchangers.48   Also, the WF indispensable for cooling can be estimated by the energy balance approach involving inflows like solar radiation reaching/leaving and convection in between air and PBR. The WF for disparate recycle ratios [recycled medium/fresh feed (0.90–1)] presents 0.10 to 379 m3 /GJ biomass.48   Other indirect uses of water include fertilizer production (N/P etc.) and the generation of energy/CO2 /flocculants required for harvesting biomass. For biofuel production [58,700–136,900 L/ha (bio-oil/ethanol)], microalgae cultivation (batch/recycling water/surface cultivation) presents WF of 1618–3748 kg water/kg biofuel.25,45,48–50   This requisite is low compared to WF of other energy crops like corn (4015 kg water/kg biofuel), palm oil (5178 kg water/kg biofuel), rapeseed (15117 kg water/kg biofuel), jatropha (22675 kg water/kg biofuel), sugarcane (3931 kg water/kg biofuel), soybean (13676 kg water/kg biofuel), sorghum (15331 kg water/kg biofuel). The water involved in biomass generation is the accruing effect of system loss, geometry, reuse, and reclamation.38   In open cultivation, water evaporation depends upon the depth and diameter of the pond. Meta-analysis manifests that successful cultivation in the reused medium depends on the taxa and the strain of algae/cyanobacteria.31,51   The growth of Staurosira  sp. (diatom) was impeded in reused medium, while Navicula  sp. (diatom) grew well. In algal biomass generation, it is important to estimate the water required to meet the target productivity, system geometry replaced water, and natural loss.38      16.3 Integrated phytoremediation and biomass production for bioenergy 16.3.1 Pollutants in wastewater and industrial effluents Ascertaining the composition is important for phycoremediation by algae/cyanobacteria and biomass generation in wastewater/effluent (Table 16.1  ). Pollutants are released from disparate sectors (commercial, domestic, industrial, and agricultural). The contaminants are fecal matter, household washes, nutrients from agricultural fields, hospital biodegradable wastes, slaughterhouse wastes, nonbiodegradables like pharmaceuticals, toxic wastes (dyes/heavy metals), landfill leachates, stormwater, etc.41,52   The presence of deadly microorganisms like antibiotic-resistant bacteria, protozoa, viruses, helminths, biotoxins, etc., causes a great environmental hazard, including severe diseases like jaundice, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis, etc.41,53   Municipal wastewater is very much preferred by microalgae pertaining to the presence of requisite nutrients (mostly high N/P) and low toxicity. In municipal wastewater, microalgae removed total nitrogen (89.1%), total phosphorus (80.9%), ammonium nitrogen (93.9%), and COD of 90.8%.41,54,55   The pH ascertained in both wet market wastewater (5.5–7.5) and slaughterhouse wastewater (6.5–7.76) was acidic to slightly basic.56   The slaughterhouse wastewater also includes BOD (750–2649 mg/L), COD (3000–4672 mg/L), TSS (300–3092 mg/L), TN (16–212 mg/L), TP (16–42.8 mg/L), TOC (862 mg/L), etc. The high nutrients, heavy metals, and toxic chemicals present in wastewater pollute the air/water/land and cause a hazard to human and animal health.57   The hazardous contaminants include pesticides, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, radioactive matter, etc. Apart from very acidic pH (1.8), acid mine drainage contains SO4 , Pb, Fe, Cu, Zn, Co, Mn, Ni, and high COD.58,59   The “coal-fired power station” is the source of CO2 , contaminated “ash water” with heavy metals like Cr (1.65 µg/L), As (52 µg/L), Al (75.7 µg/L), Cu (2.62 µg/L), Cd (1.02 µg/L), Zn (24.6 µg/L) and Ni (21.6 µg/L).60   The basic (pH8.2) anaerobic digestion piggery effluent was highly contaminated with NH4 + -N (1315 mg/L), PO4 -P (34.55 mg/L), NO2 -N (10.53 µg/L), Mg (224 mg/L), K (700 mg/L), Fe (12.4 mg/L), NO3 -N (18.70 mg/L), COD (1585.50 mg/L), etc.61   A high COD (302 mg/L) and nutrients like NH3 -N(106 mg/L), PO4 3−  (82 mg/L), NO2 -N (60 mg/L), and NO3 -N (180 mg/L) are also observed in anaerobically digested abattoir effluent.62   Also, the tanning industry causes great environmental pollution.63   The tannery wastewater typically contains TN (715 mg/L), Cl− (5960 mg/L), N-NH4 + (622 mg/L), P-PO4 3− (6.98 mg/L), COD (3633 mg/L), pH (8.3) and EC (−68.3 mv). Urban wastewater is also contaminated with pharmaceutical pollutants.64   Pharmaceutical components like alfuzosin, biperiden, bupropion, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clonazepam, dicycloverin, eprosartan, flecainide, fluconazole,    haloperidol, loperamide, mirtazapine, oxazepam, risperidone, venlafaxine, etc. Also, a large volume of wastewater is generated from the alcohol industry.65   Membrane-treated distillery wastewater was estimated to contain a high amount of TN (~60 mg/L) and TP (~25 mg/L). In distillery wastewater, the nutrients (macro/micro) like Na+ (269 mg/L), K+  (1020 mg/L), Mg2+ (18.8 mg/L), Fe2+  (1.8 mg/L), As3+  (0.03 mg/L), Mo2+  (0.07 mg/L), Pb2+  (0.03 mg/L), Cu2+ (0.18 mg/L) were high.  16.3.2 Cultivation of algae/cyanobacteria in wastewater/industrial effluents Algae/cyanobacteria grow in different types of wastewater/industrial effluents and efficiently reduce/remove pollutants therein (Table 16.2  ). Microalgae applied in phycoremediation of wastewaters are from disparate sources like municipal, industrial, produced water, anaerobic digestive process, leather processing, textile industry, pharmaceuticals, agro-industry, mining, landfill leachate, slaughterhouse, aquaculture, etc.3,56,82   Wastewater from disparate sources (livestock, municipal, food processing, etc.) in various combinations can be treated by algae and bacteria in a symbiotic association. The fast-growing algae/bacteria association removes excess nutrients and organics, while the biomass is harvested for bioenergy production in HTL.24   The HTL process produces wastewater, and the biomass thus developed was either autotrophic or heterotrophic growth depending on the dilution with filtered municipal wastewater. Under photoautotrophic conditions, biomass obtained was 146(spiked with 1% post-HTL wastewater)-541(spiked with 0.5% post-HTL wastewater) mg/L. Under the light, filtered municipal water spiked with 1% post-HTL wastewater, producing 14 times more biomass (2.5 g/L) than the heterotrophic condition. In a similar condition, the biomass efficiently reduced total soluble nitrogen (86%), NH4 + -N (100%), and total soluble phosphorous (95%). Also, the availability and location determine the cost-effectiveness of algae/cyanobacteria biomass production in wastewater. It is suggested that for practical applicability, it is required to have a colocation of wastewater source and biomass cultivation/treatment site with abundant sunlight.25,83   The microalgae/cyanobacteria like Dunaliella tertiolecta , Dunaliella salina , Isochrysis galbana , Cyanobacterium aponicum , Nannochloropsis oculata , Chlorella vulgaris  are well adapted to “produced water” in the oil-field.84   In municipal wastewater influent, the algal consortium (Tetradesmus dimorphus , Dictyosphaerium , etc.) reduced inorganic nitrogen (67.8%), total phosphorus (55.6%), pharmaceuticals (−5000% to 99%) with a biomass generation of 0.22 g/L.64  Arthospira platensis  cultivated in raw “anaerobic digestate abattoir” effluent produced biomass of 1.48 g/L with a “specific growth rate” of 0.49 days−1 .62     Seawater has been emphasized for biomass generation of potential marine forms of algae/cyanobacteria. However, seawater is limited to NO3 -N and other essential nutrients. Therefore, “nutrient-rich wastewater” can be combined with saline water to increase productivity. Remarkably, microalgal biofilms are used to remove excessive pollutants from municipal wastewater.85   The process is augmented by continuous lighting (230 mmol/m2 /s). It efficiently removed N (1.0 g/m2 /day) and P (0.13 g/m2 /day). The “physico-chemical characteristics” of wastewater determine the productivity of the biomass. Under mixotrophic growth, Scenedesmus obliquus  produced biomass of 4.9 g/L on supplementation of cheese-whey permeate (40%) from a dairy industry.82   The microalga C. vulgaris  treated textile effluents.86   The microalga presented the highest growth rate (OD680  1.62), decolorized methylene blue, and reduced COD (99.7%) in diluted effluent (50%). The cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis  in a “packed-bed up-flow column” removed reactive blue 19 (251.61 mg/g) from a textile effluent.87   Conventional algal/cyanobacterial biomass production uses a large number of fertilizers. Algae can utilize both organic and inorganic carbon. Therefore, algae cultivated under mixotrophy require less sunlight to grow. Under the heterotrophic conditions, Chlorella  sp. produced 8.90 g/L of biomass, which was sixfold higher than the photoautotrophic growth with more lipid production (fourfold).11   Water formation during oil drilling is a threat to the environment, pertaining to the presence of complex hydrocarbons. The native microalga C. vulgaris  BS1 was isolated from the wastewater. Phycoremediation reduced petroleum hydrocarbons (98.63%) with a growth rate of 0.21 days−1  without additional nutrients.80   The treatment eliminated SO4  and COD by 75%. The use of wastewater for biomass production is useful for cleaning wastewater, reducing eutrophication by removing N and P, no prerequisite of additional nutrients (except a few), oxygenation of the water, CO2  removal, decreasing the impact of other wastewater treatments, earning extra revenues for municipal wastewater plants and livestock producers.88,89     16.4 Water requirement in bioenergy production 16.4.1 Virtual water in bioenergy A massive volume of water is required to implement the “renewable bioenergy” source on a large scale. This requirement presents significant nexus allying water and energy.100   Virtual water (VW) is the requisite amount of water pertaining to the generation of the product, which has significant relevance in trading (VW transfer) between countries. There are two types of VW, viz. real and theoretical.100   The real VW deals  with the water required on the production site without importing. The theoretical VW is the water saved while importing the product. The VW content is estimated by considering all the final production stages, including raw material cultivation. A virtual trade resource-based energy network is generated as energy resources are distributed globally with greater energy access. Given a globalized economy, an integrated approach to energy and the WF database is important, influenced by the population and current environment.101   In the context of energy trade, VW is embedded therein and is expanding globally. For VW, a 35% increase was observed from 2012 (157 km3 ) to 2018 (211 km3 ). The significant virtual contributors are electricity, oil, fuelwood, and biodiesel. However, coal/charcoal and hydrocarbons make less than 4% contributions. The maximum VW trade was observed for biodiesel, exported from South Africa together with Western Europe. Europe is the greatest consumer (importer and exporter) of biodiesel-based VW. In the “biodiesel market,” the largest VW (75%) is shared by palm oil consuming global water of 2%–3%.102   An increase in the use of freshwater resources for bioenergy may also lead to a shortage of local/regional water.103   VW trade is relevant in increasing water resource efficiency and saving water globally.100    16.4.2 Water footprint in bioenergy Biofuel production is essential for replacing “nonrenewable fuels” together with climate change alleviation. The descending order of WF for the “fossil energy” is uranium (0.1 m3 /GJ) > natural gas (0.1 m3 /GJ) > coal (0.2 m3 /GJ) > crude oil (1.1 m3 /GJ). Renewable energy production has higher WF than nonrenewable forms. The WF for hydropower is 22 m3 /GJ, followed by solar thermal energy (0.3 m3 /GJ) and wind energy (insignificant). In productive agricultural land, the WF for biomass resources is 70–400 times higher than most of the energy carriers.34   Bioenergy plantation for partial irrigation is estimated to be ~600 Mha (2095), restraining global warming to ~1.5°C by the century. However, marginal bioenergy plantation may lead to an increase in temperature of 3°C.46   For algal bioenergy, the WF is 8–193 m3 /GJ for the “net energy” provided.6   It is estimated that the transportation fuel (3.5%) in European Union will be mostly occupied the algae-based fuel in 2030. The energy output-input (EOI) ratio varies among the countries for both wet and dry conversion processes. For wet conversion, the EOI ratio is in the decreasing order of Livorno-Italy (1.83) > Perth-Australia (1.55) > New Mexico-USA (1.47) > Tamanrasset-Algeria (1.24) > Utrecht- Netherlands (1.23) > Hawaii-USA (1.19). If water not recycles, 1 kg algae-biodiesel requires phosphate-0.71 kg, nitrogen-0.33 kg, and  water-3726 kg.45   The WF varies with the type of energy crops. As large energy crop production may worsen the stressed water situation, the “abandoned agricultural land” together with “degraded lands” (sparsely vegetated) for energy crop plantation may be suggested.40   The most intensive WF is associated with the cultivation of energy crops as a feedstock.104   For higher energy crops like “cassava ethanol” and “sweet sorghum ethanol,” the WF is 783–2926 and 4394–13,541 L/L of ethanol, respectively. The WF in the “bottom-up approach” starts with the product itself, whereas a “top-down approach” considers production, import, and export as well.100   The WF in Brazil is related to sugarcane production pertaining to ethanol export. The country is the world’s largest exporter. The richer states benefit more from exporting, which causes more water stress on the poorer.105   In Brazil, ethanol production is higher from sugarcane (140 m3 /GJ ethanol) than from maize (99 m3 /GJ ethanol). However, in the US, maize (104 m3 /GJ) is in higher demand than sugarcane (78 m3 /GJ) for ethanol production.34   In the “Environment-Enhancing Energy” system (E2 -system), it is possible to produce large-scale algal biofuel by reducing WF.24   In the HTL, the nutrient accumulated in the water phase is reused by recycling back for cultivation, reducing the nutrient cost. The “blue-water footprint” for microalgal bioenergy production involves water drawn from freshwater resources for biomass generation and water loss on biomass drying. Since water loss in photosynthesis and drying is low, not included in WF in biofuel generation.48,106   Altogether, WF in bioenergy production from algae accounts for water in cultivation, harvesting, evaporation, cooling, and downstream processing as well. Also, it has been estimated that the requisite for water management is 7 times higher than the energy (biodiesel) produced.38     16.5 Water reuse in a biorefinery 16.5.1 Factors affecting water reuse The potentiality of microalgae/cyanobacteria to grow in the reused medium is taxa-specific. Water reuse is reliant on the taxa (less significant for algal consortium), culture conditions (growth phase, nutrient concentrations, cell density), and harvesting.44   Although water reuse reduces WF, nutrient input, and overall climate impact, the recycled medium often contains inhibitory factors reducing growth. A reasonable quantity of chemical flocculants (e.g., Al; NaOH) is used for algae/cyanobacteria. The flocculants, in turn, hinder the growth of microalgae/cyanobacteria.25   The harmful metal-based flocculants can be replaced by the pH-adjusted (acidic/basic) harvesting methods. However, the pH in  the water of the medium needs to be adjusted before reuse. Also, biomass productivity in a “recycled medium” is delimited by the released metabolites present therein. The toxic compounds, corresponding carbohydrates, proteins, cell wall debris, dissolved organic compounds, contaminating organisms, and accumulated heavy metals accumulate with each cultivation cycle.25,107   The extracellular substances released by the algal/cyanobacterial cells may also promote the growth of bacteria.25,108   The polysaccharides/glycoproteins are the cell wall components providing structural support to the algal cells. The cell walls break down during cell division. The remains of the cell wall from “Nannochloropsis  sp.” accelerated the growth of bacteria, which further required ultrafiltration for reusability of the water in the medium.44,109,110   Microalgae also produce dissolved organic matter (DOM) through the process of active exudation, cell lysis, and passive diffusion.44   DOM of A. platensis  was generally (70%) composed of sugars (>3 kDa). DOM [(189.21 mg/L); control (54.92 mg/L)], and decreased the growth of Euglena gracilis  after repeated cycles.2   Reused medium also accumulates released fatty acids inhibiting growth.44,111   The elements like Mg, K, Na, and Ca and salinity increase in the medium. The E. gracilis  cultivation was limited to only two cycles. The augmentation of Cl− /Na+  (fivefold) and uric acid inhibited growth.2    16.5.2 Water footprint/nutrients reduction strategy Water consumption can be reduced by 6 times if water is recycled for biomass generation.48,112   For marine taxa, the recycled wastewater medium can be mixed with seawater. It reduces freshwater requirements (90%) and nutrients by at least 55%, as presented in biodiesel production from C. vulgaris .45,48   Also, it reduces the cost of biodiesel generation by 52.4%.93   Depending on the adhering behavior, microalgae cultivated on a suitable substratum (glass, cellulose membrane, cotton rope, paper, cardboard, stainless steel, nylon sponge, polystyrene foam, polyurethane foam) can reduce WF required for cultivation.48,113   The difficulties in illumination can be overcome by coinoculating self-illuminating photobacteria.113   A high oil-producing microalga “Botryococcus braunii”  was cultivated on agar as a substratum.48,114   The matrix-enclosed method (Ca-alginate trapped cells) and heterotrophic cultivation (use of organic carbon) also increase the oil contents and decrease WF.48,104   Commercially, the “anaerobic digestion process” releases large quantities of nutrients in its digestate effluents.27   Also, carbonization, HTL, flash hydrolysis, and gasification are the potential nutrient recovery methods.27,82   Organic matter in the medium can be reduced with activated carbon, and biomass productivity can be enhanced by the addition of nutrients like N. Mixotrophic growth may  also enhance the growth of the microalgae like Ankistrodesmus  sp. pertaining to the presence of organic molecules/polysaccharides in the medium.27,115   The nutrient recovery methods include anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal treatments-gasification, liquefaction, carbonization, flash hydrolysis, etc.82   The environmental impact of wastewater cultivated algal biofuel is lesser than that of freshwater.89   Phycoremediation, together with biomass production, is a sustainable process for pollutant removal/transformation (nutrients, humic matter, xenobiotics), removing carbon/WFs.57   Ultrafiltration membranes (≥ 50 kDa) are useful in separating bacteria, viruses, polysaccharides, macromolecular proteins, etc., leaving unused ions and DOM.2   Also, ultrafiltration in combination and separation with sand filtration/activated carbon produced quality biodiesel. It contributed to WF reduction by 15% in two cycles.116   The water used for washing/purification of biodiesel can be reused after recycling (Fig. 16.1  ).   16.6 Bioenergy and sustainable development goals In 2015 (September 25), the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted 17 “sustainable development goals” with 169 targets and > 232 indicators. Although some areas are well advanced, some of the targets still require immediate and fast progress to achieve the targets by 2030.117   The “first generation” of biofuel provided clean energy-SDG7.14   However, the first and second generations of biofuels have negative impacts on SDG-2 (zero hunger)/SDG-6 (clean water and sanitation)/SDG-12 (responsible consumption and production)/SDG-14(life below water), together with SDG-15(life on land). Microalgae transform 9%–10% of solar radiation with “biomass productivity” of 77 g/biomass/ m2 /day with a production of 280 tons/ha/year.118   It consumes additional energy to provide water (freshwater/saline) for biomass production to meet this global demand. It has been estimated that pumping water per one meter of depth requires 0.02 MJ/m3  of additional water. Energy consumption for pumping saline water from the aquifers is also 3.6 MJ/m3 /180 m of depth.25,38   Therefore, “surface water” is more cost-effective than groundwater for biomass production. Reusing medium water requires energy for pumping back to the cultivation tank/PBR. However, recycling reduces the cost of energy consumption than fresh medium cultivation. If water is recycled, the energy required for the cultivation system can be provided by the left-over algal biomass in biodiesel production. Energy can still be derived from the biomass pertaining to the rich carbohydrates, proteins, and other macromolecules therein. Interestingly, for recycled water (100%), the energy consumption for nutrients like N and P can be saved (45%) with each kg of biodiesel production.25   Significant trade-offs must be resolved to achieve global water and food security.46   All the SDGs are interrelated, with 319 interactions between SDG 6/14 and the rest of the SDGs presenting both positive (286) and negative (33) interactions.119   A green alternative, algal-based wastewater treatment (A-WWT) system was developed with an affordable and appropriate pathway.120   The system is useful in wastewater treatment, safe reuse, water-use efficiency, ensuring freshwater supplies, implementing water reuse, and restoring aquatic ecosystems. Also, SDGs are concerned with no poverty (SDG-1), zero hunger (SDG-2), and good health and well-being (SDG-3). Hence, WF reduction directly affects socioeconomic upliftment.120   On the other hand, the A-WWT system is contributing to all 17 SDGs. The single-step removal of BOD, N, and P to secondary levels at lower energy input is connected to SDG-2/3/6, SDG-11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG-9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure)/SDG-10 (reduced inequalities)/SDG-13 (climate action)/SDG-14 (life below water). The biofuel recovery for minimal net energy input with reduced GHGs emissions contributes to SDG-6/7/12 (responsible consumption and production)/13. On implementation of appropriate supply chains of biomass with the integration of existing systems can provide positive contributions to the SDGs.121   Microalgal biotechnology provides solutions to many challenges rising from pollution and poor resource management with multiple product development assisting in attaining the UN’s SDGs.122   The global “Sustainable Development Report,” 2022, presents poor/decreasing performance for most countries. While Finland topped the SDG index (86.51), countries like India ranked 121 (60.32) among 193 countries. The downfall of many countries was pertaining to “The Covid-19 pandemic.” Countries have difficulties in progress due to population increase, uneven development, and resource scarcity,  with rapidly developing economies and less developed countries.122,123   The “value-added products” in biorefinery directly contribute to SDG-2 (zero hunger). The cyanobacterium Spirulina  sp. has already been globally commercialized as a “rich source” of protein. People opting for a vegetarian/vegan diet prefer algae as a sustainable source of protein.122,124   The high-rate algal ponds potentially treat wastewater with sequestration from CO2  (GHGs). The eutrophication negatively impacts SDG-6/14. The microalgae/cyanobacterial biofertilizers retain the water in the soil, reduce additional fertilizer (N/P) input, and maintain the water quality. Interestingly, energy crops reduce GHGs, improve water/soil quality, and cause biodiversity increase.17   The “sustainability indicator model” architecture includes identifying sustainability issues, sustainability assessment framework, sustainability calculation (indicator score × weighting=sustainability score), and mapping influence on the UN’s SDGs.15   Microalgae reduce eutrophication by uptaking nutrients (mostly N and P) for growth. To meet SDGs, the algal biomass cultivation system must be commercially scaled up for biorefinery and to achieve a circular economy.125   “Water security” is achieved since algae/cyanobacteria do not necessarily require freshwater, reducing pressure on drinking water. The carotenoids from marine algae present antioxidant and anticancer properties.126   The carotenoids are separable as a value-added product in a biorefinery, aligned with several SDGs like 1–14. Bioenergy production does require policy support with consistency and coherency for SDGs implementation.127   To obtain “socioeconomic sustainability,” the “profitability indicators” like return on investment/net present value/resource conservation indicator and fossil energy return on investment are included.128   16.6.1 Socioeconomic indicators for the sustainable development The algae industry has great implications for socioeconomic upliftment. The bioeconomy can be attained by strong applied research, strain collection valorization/genetic resources with patents, new applications, technologies, and product development. It essentially creates new education possibilities, innovations, services, and jobs. However, it requires strategic focus points like basic/applied research centers, commercial (local) strain collections, education (schools and universities), support of start-up companies, and financing. Many socioeconomic benefits have been achieved from different countries, e.g., the seaweed collected from Zanzibar island employed 30,000 people (7.6% of GDP). Bali’s seaweed industry is booming after Covid-19, generating doubled worker monthly incomes (400USD).129   Algal lipid production for biofuel is profitable. However, it has to be included with the marketing of other  products like proteins for animal feed, not only fuels. Economic analysis has to deal with other uncertainties, like anaerobic digestion in low altitudes and harvesting cost, depending on the physiological status like algal properties and nutritional/physiological status.130   Socioeconomic indicators pertaining to biofuels include environmental issues (positive/negative) and voluntary scheme compliance. Monitoring enhances the performance of the schemes promoting sustainable biofuel production at the local/regional/national level. After Rio-summit (1992), initiatives were taken to promote sustainable development and monitor its progress with challenges for implications. Indicators like income, education, health, and welfare at the regional/national level are adopted. To attain sustainable biofuel and bioenergy systems from biomass requires environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable production systems. Also, it involves a reduction in GHGs, a reduction in environmental/socioeconomic negative impacts, and positive societal outcomes. In sustainability indicators, standards refer to principles/criteria consistently used as rules/guidelines for ensuring the materials, products, processes, and services meet their purposes. A standard includes principles (sustainable production general tenets), criteria (the tenet achieving conditions and helping define the indicators), and indicators (particular questions demonstrating how producers were meeting criteria).131   It has been emphasized that ideal indicators are not present. Indicators make decisions at a national level; however, not all are equally important in all situations. The countries must choose the potential indicator according to their priorities and goals. Indicators often have limitations as parameters are simple, requiring finetuning for better reflection of SDs, and limitations in coordination among environmental/ social/economic/institutional aspects. Often quantitative indicators limit measuring environmental and social subjective indicators. Also, indicators are required to develop critical dimensions like social/cultural/institutional together with political. Social impacts require household surveys, the interaction between environmental and socioeconomic indicators, a description of the social-environment interface, and addressing social sustainability. Statistical parameters in socioeconomic indicators provide useful development monitoring for a while against a baseline; consideration along standard/certification scheme; employing together with qualitative/quantitative data; apply on supply chain (feedstock production/conversion); certification scheme employment.131   The criteria for selecting indicators are reliability and quality, validity, realistic/practical, spatial/temporality, simplicity/clarity, comparability, consensus, measurability, reviewability, limitation and balance, links, relevance, cost-benefit, etc. The important factors to be noted are production cost, employment, the ratio between local/migrant workers, community investment, income spent on basic needs, benefits created for women,  availability/quality of water, and access to ecosystem services.132   Also, it provides less dependence on imports and improved fuel protection, as observed in Brazil (national policies) and parts of Africa (smaller population level). The socioeconomic benefits include equal benefit sharing among the societies (rural/urban) while improving living quality. Policy recommendation substantially impacts biofuels offering incentives to producers and consumers.133   Technological nature, local economy, societal profile, and production processes affect socioeconomic impacts. The Global Bioenergy Partnership has developed 16 indicators for socioeconomic sustainability for bioenergy. These indicators include land allocation/tenure as per new bioenergy generation; price/supply of a food basket (national); income change; bioenergy sector-related jobs; unpaid time change spent by women/children while biomass collection; bioenergy for modern energy excess expansion; mortality change/ indoor smoke-based disease burden; and occurrence of occupational illness, fatalities, and injury. The rest are productivity; energy balance (net); value added (gross); fossil fuels consumption change/ biomass use (traditional); workforce training/re-qualification; diverse energy; bioenergy distribution (infrastructure/logistics); and bioenergy utilization (capacity/flexibility). A few of the indicators are assessable only after project accomplishment. Also, the biofuel industry generates direct unskilled/skilled jobs. Regular feedstock transportations are indirect job.134   At least 236 indicators as per socioeconomic impacts were observed under 12 categories. The impact categories under economic feasibility (project/national level) macroeconomic impacts follow more exante studies. For bioenergy, the relevant exante quantification requires the reflection of bioenergy effects, included in certification schemes or agreed upon in stakeholder consultation processes (important indicators considered by the public, policymakers, companies, and other stakeholders), and can be assigned a numerical value. For the impact category of rural economic development, the indicator is the change in added gross value in the share of people below the poverty line/number of poor people. Indicators for energy access are the expansion of bioenergy while providing modern energy access with a population share with enhanced energy access. The indicators of change in fossil fuel imports, energy diversity/diversification, change in fossil fuel utilization, and traditional biomass fall under the impact category of energy independence. The impact category of economic feasibility is indicated by productivity/resource efficiency, infrastructure and logistics capacity for bioenergy distribution, total investment, profitability (yearly), present value (net), return on investment, payback period, and return internal rate. Impact categories (13) for bioenergy were identified: employment/income, food security, macroeconomic development, rural economic development, energy access, energy independence, economic  feasibility, health and safety, land rights, social acceptability, working conditions, community impacts, and equal opportunities.135   Social sustainability involves, amongst other aspects, the potential for a more equitable distribution of economic benefits across society, including regional and urban communities, and improvements in living quality. The most obvious of these benefits is the establishment of an energy industry that can sustain longer-term fuel demands to generate employment and economic growth in rural communities. Microalgae-based industries also present opportunities for economic growth in nonmetropolitan and regional areas. Public/private investment is often centered on employment and income opportunities for businesses and local communities.136   In commercially available algal biofuel facilities, indicators representing categories include energy security, resource conservation, profitability, external trade, and social acceptability/ well-being. The scientific literature indicates profitability, return on investment/net present value, resource conservation, and energy return on investment (fossil) indicators. To achieve a sustainable biofuel system, the indicators present sustainability targets with clarity. The indicators present environmental/socioeconomic sustainability contributing to progressive sustainable algal biofuels. For algal biofuels, the socioeconomic impact category involves social well-being, energy security, external trade, profitability, resource conservation, and social acceptability. The indicators include employment, household income, workdays lost due to injury, food security, premium-energy security, volatility in fuel price, trade volume, terms of trade, investment return, net present value, depletion as per nonrenewable resources, fossil energy investment return, public opinion, transparency, effective stakeholder participation, risk of catastrophe. The sustainable indicators that impact public opinion are food security, energy security, employment, profitability, GHGs releases, injury-caused workdays lost, air quality, risk of catastrophe, biodiversity, water quality/quantity, profitability, etc.128    16.6.2 Sustainable development in different countries in relation to SDGs Internal biofuel markets with well-established plans have been initiated in countries like the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, and Europe. Biodiesel production in the countries has been greatly increased pertaining to the increased fuel demand, global clean energy production, and to fulfill of different global programs. Biodiesel production in South-Asian countries (Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia) ranged between 70%–250%. In Europe, a large arable land (1.4 million hectares) generates biofuel, mostly established in Austria,  Germany, Italy, France, and Sweden.137   From 2009–2019, the demand for various renewable energy has increased by 15.1 exajoules, EJ at a rate per 4.4%/year (UNEP, 2021). However, the targets set by the different countries before the COVID-19 pandemic could not be fulfilled. Reportedly, China set the target of 12.7 and 2.3 billion liters of bioethanol and biodiesel (annual) separately by 2020. Also, the Economic Community of West African States had a target of enhancing biofuel production (bioethanol/biodiesel) by 5% in transportation by 2020, forecasted to increase by 10% by 2030. Governments have developed policies for industries to meet various challenges like food/feed, energy supply (local), bio-materials, and uncertainties (socioeconomic/environmental). As China is progressing greatly economically, there is a surge in energy demand. The rise in energy consumption was from 2614 to 4300 Mtce in 2007 and 2016, respectively.138   In Russia, bioenergy production is increasing from 90,617 MW (2014) to 117828 MW (2018).139   In European Union, bioenergy contributed 116 Mtoe (2016), 59% of all renewable and 10% of all energy sources.138   The USA presents utilization of domestic renewable energy of 32% (2006–12). It has been predicted that the global petroleum demand will increase by 50% in 2018 with 118 million barrels/day, led by China, Europe, and the United States. Bioenergy markets would need to benefit small farmers in developing countries to make a substantive contribution to sustainable development. Small-scale producers in different countries would be benefitted from the certification system. A sound scientific system is important rather than more emphasis on political economy and corporate interests with better market access for developing countries.140   There exists a significant relationship between supply chains of bioenergy-biomass and SDGs. Notably, establishing proper supply chains with the integration of the existing system provides significant contributions to SDG7/8/9/12.121   Although a value chain exists for algal biomass, a significant gap exists in dimension, organization, capability, and algae production in Europe. More than 505 of the companies (23 countries) with production units (447) produce microalgae/cyanobacteria (Spirulina ). However, macroalgae production depends on wild collections (68%), mostly in the countries like Ireland, France, and Spain. Germany, Italy, and Spain produce microalgae at large. Most of the production units distributed among 23 countries are small, however, generating livelihood in coastal areas. Economic feasibility along with environmental sustainability could be approached by emphasizing the biorefinery approach.141   Central/South America contributes 8–25 EJ energy /year, favored by political and economic conditions. India presents tremendous potentiality of 2–4 EJ/year. South-east Asia owns a potentiality of 1–11 EJ. This region faces the challenges like high land-use density, risks to food security, deforestation, and the need to  conserve biological diversity. Sub-Saharan Africa presents the potentiality of 5–15 EJ; however, persistent fragility in government and economic instability have resulted in difficulties in realizing.142   Indonesia’s government has set specific targets for energy demand, energy security concerns, and global warming to meet renewable energy (23%) in 2025 and 31% in 2050 of total energy. The mandatory biodiesel program has fulfilled 60% of the target year 2025. Indonesia is also providing policy support to expand technology for bioenergy for implementing SDG.127   The countries in the Sahara region of Africa are quite promising for SDG7. However, constraints arise as per high fluctuations in temperature day/night. In Egypt and Morocco, the local energy sector is being developed with wind and sun energy. Exploring bioenergy production in those conditions is suggested as a complementing effort for the renewable energy drive.143   The production and consumption of bioenergy in Sweden and Finland per capita are high compared to Denmark and Norway. The factors like local jobs and livelihoods, the local desire for climate-neutral energy, and reasonable heating costs have led to the development of bioenergy communities.144   Microalgal oil productivity to its maximum is achievable in the countries like Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, or Mozambique (24–27 m3  Oil/ha/year or 13–15 g oil m2 /day). Kenya (2.28 g oil/m2 /day) and Chile (0.77 g oil/m2 /day) have comparatively less productivity. In Brazil, marine microalgae are cultivable in nonarable (16%) land.18   The United States has set federal guidelines and implemented Environmental Protection Agency-based Clean Power Plan to achieve efficient carbon emission reduction of CO2  (32%) by 2030. Several other countries, including Canada and European Union, are following the strategy.145   The major biodiesel is produced in developing nations of Argentina, India, Brazil, China, Indonesia, South Africa, Thailand, Ghana, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, and Croatia. African countries (Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco) and developing European countries (Albani, Moldova, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia) have low development in biodiesel production.146   To achieve SDG 7 and makeover lost time, the energy intensity improvement must be 3.2% annually. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia are reportedly reaching the target by 2.7% of growth pertaining to high economic growth (2010–2019). In this period, the region was followed by Australia together with New Zealand (2.3%), Europe and Northern America (2%), Central and Southern Asia (2%), Sub-saharan Africa (1.3%), Northern Africa/Western Asia (1.2%), Oceania (0.7%), and Latin America/Caribbean (0.6%). Also, international public financing has been slowed down in 2019 (10.9 billion dollars) by 24% from the previous year, which was further slowed down by Covid-19.147      16.7 Conclusion and future prospects To meet the global demand, algae/cyanobacteria are the only fonts supporting other energy sources. The sustainability of biofuels is determined by the type, raw materials, technology, culture, and country’s other attributes.14   Microalgae/cyanobacteria are cultivated in open ponds, PBRs/closed systems in different wastewater/effluents with different physical/chemical/biological properties. Microalgae are the source of multiple biofuels like bio-oil, biomethane, biodiesel, bioethanol, and biohydrogen. Cyanobacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen, require fewer N-sources, and degrade the pollutants in wastewater/effluents.26   Biofuel production is directly/indirectly related to most of the SDGs. For sustainability, third/fourth-generation biofuels from algae/cyanobacteria are more promising. However, the commercialization of biofuels depends on suitable tolerant taxa with a higher growth rate for cultivation in wastewater/effluent. Mixotrophic taxa are preferable for cultivation in dark organic effluents. Also, taxa capable of being cultivated on an “artificial substratum” reduce WF. To support the SDGs, the microalgal bioeconomy must be concerned with cost-effective large-scale cultivation, harvesting, and downstream processing.122   Industrially, it is required to reduce energy input, materials, and freshwater requirements with suitable deterministic mathematical models to look over water (real/theoretical)/nutrient losses from the cultivation system. Water recyclability/maximization of water reusability must go together with the appropriate determination of inhibitory substances. Global sites with suitable meteorological attributes and proper management must opt to maximize biomass generation and reduce WF. Implementing requisite “biomass supply chains” produced in effluents/wastewater, effectual resource management, and recycling/reusing of water together with contemporary technology development will support the biofuel industry with economic growth, clean energy, and a sustainable environment.
