                  Background
                  There is a need and urgency to strengthen the analysis of the interactions between cultured meat and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to shed new light on the map of synergies and trade-offs within and between the multiple goals in the context of regional differences. Accordingly, this article seeks to answer the question: what are the interactions between cultured meat and the SDGs?
               
                  Scope and approach
                  The methodology comprises an integrative literature review and content analysis of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets and the application of a seven-point scale framework that assists decision-makers in mapping the nature and the strengths of the interactions. The analysis advances novel propositions about the impact of cultured meat on the SDGs and well-being.
               
                  Key findings and conclusions
                  Cultured meat systems will effectively unleash a virtuous cycle of SDGs and well-being within and across the North-South when confronting and juxtaposing environmental, health, social, economic, and law-oriented goals. They will be more successful when engaging in institutional change to resolve tensions between the short-term (socioeconomic) objectives and the long-term (societal and planetary) outcomes needed to fuel systemic resilience and sustainable development. Culture meat comprises technological capabilities but lacks sustainable businesses to tackle multiple SDGs grand challenges and systemically address their relationships. This article informs policymakers with significant perspectives to foster a virtuous cycle and outlines strategic capabilities needed to responsibly deliver long-term sustainable values in the scope of cultured meat.

Prefeito Lothario Meissner 632, 80210-170, Curitiba, PR, Brazil      Background There is a need and urgency to strengthen the analysis of the interactions between cultured meat and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to shed new light on the map of synergies and trade-offs within and between the multiple goals in the context of regional differences. Accordingly, this article seeks to answer the question: what are the interactions between cultured meat and the SDGs?  Scope and approach The methodology comprises an integrative literature review and content analysis of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets and the application of a seven-point scale framework that assists decision-makers in mapping the nature and the strengths of the interactions. The analysis advances novel propositions about the impact of cultured meat on the SDGs and well-being.  Key findings and conclusions Cultured meat systems will effectively unleash a virtuous cycle of SDGs and well-being within and across the North-South when confronting and juxtaposing environmental, health, social, economic, and law-oriented goals. They will be more successful when engaging in institutional change to resolve tensions between the short-term (socioeconomic) objectives and the long-term (societal and planetary) outcomes needed to fuel systemic resilience and sustainable development. Culture meat comprises technological capabilities but lacks sustainable businesses to tackle multiple SDGs grand challenges and systemically address their relationships. This article informs policymakers with significant perspectives to foster a virtuous cycle and outlines strategic capabilities needed to responsibly deliver long-term sustainable values in the scope of cultured meat.   Graphical abstract Image 1       Keywords Cultured meat  Future foods  Sustainable development goals  Environmental-health-social-economic-law  Business sustainability  Paradox  Integrative review    1 Introduction Cultured meat represents a future food technology with the potential to cut off a vicious cycle of environmental deterioration and animal suffering as stimulated by livestock systems (Jairath, Mal, Gopinath, & Singh, 2021 ; Stephens et al., 2018 ; Tuomisto & Teixeira de Mattos, 2011 ; Zhang, Zhao, et al., 2020 ). It involves innovations that promise to deliver health, food security, and animal welfare and the capacity to provide high-quality protein for an unprecedented rapidly growing world population, with a relatively small ecological footprint (Bekker, Fischer, Tobi, & van Trijp, 2017 ; Bierbaum et al., 2019 ; Parodi et al., 2018 ; Post et al., 2020 ; Van der Weele, Feindt, Jan van der Goot, van Mierlo, & van Boekel, 2019 ). The literature has exhaustively focused on the environmental benefits of cultured meat when contrasted to livestock, especially regarding Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions along with land, water, and energy use (Alexander et al., 2017 ; Mattick, Landis, Allenby, & Genovese, 2015 ; Sinke & Odegard, 2021 ; Tuomisto & Teixeira de Mattos, 2011 ). Despite the alertness on climate change and anthropogenic warming consequences (Naumann, Cammalleri, Mentaschi, & Feyen, 2021 ; Parncutt, 2019 ; UNEP, 2019a ), I suggest that studying a single sustainability domain in the scope of cultured meat is not enough to tackle the short- and long-term pressures of economic, planetary, and societal boundaries. Another critical point in the literature on cultured meat is the lack of studies recognizing the different priorities regarding the SDGs in developing and developed countries (and less- and more-intensive agriculture/livestock countries) when introducing the in vitro technology. Furthermore, albeit relying on technological capabilities (Post et al., 2020 ), cultured meat might find limitations to promote a transition toward a more sustainable future that also involves addressing social, economic, regulatory, and institutional grand challenges (Stephens et al., 2018 ; Van der Weele et al., 2019 ). In this article, I argue there is a need to advance research that strengthens the analysis of the impact of cultured meat on multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their respective environmental, health, social, economic, and law categories. Studying interactions between cultured meat and the SDGs contribute to understanding the map of synergies and trade-offs within and between multiple goals and their categories. Accordingly, this article seeks to answer this central research question: what are the interactions between cultured meat and the SDGs?  Answering this inquiry involves understanding the nature, strengths, and regional differences that feature the interactions. The methodology comprises an integrative literature review, a content analysis of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets, and a seven-point scale framework that assists judgments about the nature and strengths of the interactions. The integrative review demonstrated the lack of research needed to answer the inquiry on the impact of cultured meat on the SDGs. Although the literature is relevant to some sustainability domains (e.g., environmental, health, social, economic, and political), it does neither address their tensions, interdependence, and temporality nor confront and juxtapose them. However, the integrative review was useful to identify the literature's views on the benefits and challenges of cultured meat and organize them into sustainability domains. Content analysis contributed to the understanding and judging of the nature and the strengths of the interactions between cultured meat and the SDGs with the support of a seven-point scale framework and sustainability science publications. The nature can be associated with synergetic (or positive), neutral, or trade-off (or negative) interactions, and the strength can vary from being very much positive (+3) to very much negative (−3). The resulting map of the nature and the strengths of the interactions contributes to clarifying the impact of cultured meat on the SDGs of Agenda 2030 (UN, 2015 ). The analysis involved (a) organizing the integrative review articles per subject and sustainability domain and (b) mapping the nature and the strengths of the interactions organized into the 17 SDGs and five categories of environmental, health, social, economic, and law-oriented SDGs. The analysis of the integrative literature review in (a) was insightful to the analysis of the interactions in (b). Nevertheless, they differ in some perspectives on the implications of cultured meat on social and economic issues. On one side, the reviewed literature in (a) does not inform an interdependence view of sustainability domains (i.e., it does not systematically address the relationships between distinct sustainability aspects). On the other side, the analysis in (b) acknowledges tensions to address relationships and explore synergies among the SDGs to fuel long-term progress. I advanced propositions on the impact of cultured meat on the SDGs, their five categories, and well-being in the context of developing and developed countries. Discussions suggested that cultured meat systems will be more effective in unleashing a virtuous cycle of SDGs and well-being from North to South and vice versa when confronting and juxtaposing environmental, health, social, economic, and law-oriented goals. Indeed, they will be more successful when engaging in institutional change to resolve tensions between the short-term (socioeconomic) objectives and the long-term (societal and planetary) outcomes needed to fuel systemic resilience and sustainable development. However, cultured meat lacks sustainable businesses despite representing a promising food innovation with technological capabilities. Thus, cultured meat will have more potential to benefit society and the planet if it embraces true business sustainability (Dyllick & Muff, 2016 ) to tackle multiple SDGs grand challenges (George, Howard-Grenville, Joshi, & Tihanyi, 2016 ) and systemically address their relationships (Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, & Figge, 2015 ). This article informs policymakers with significant perspectives to foster a virtuous cycle and outlines strategic capabilities needed to responsibly deliver long-term sustainable values in the scope of cultured meat.  2 Sustainable development goals Sustainable Development (SD) voices received greater attention and diffusion from the United Nations (UN) publication of Our Common Future  (UNWCED, 1987 ). Later, SD advanced from The Millennium Development Goals  towards a new universal Agenda  2030 that includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets to address the world's most urgent economic, social, environmental, and governance challenges in the years 2015–2030 (UN, 2015 ; UNDESA, 2020b ; UNEP, 2019a ). Holistically, the SDGs provide a coherent framework for creating a better future based on collaborative efforts by all parties in society. Understanding interactions within and between the SDGs timely, locally, and across different world regions is necessary to manage trade-offs and synergies to benefit people and the planet (Lusseau & Mancini, 2019 ; Nilsson, Griggs, & Visbeck, 2016 ). Trade-offs imply that progress in one goal hinders progress in another, and synergies mean that progress in one goal favors progress. The 17 SDGs are interrelated (UN, 2015 ; UNDESA, 2020b ; UNEP, 2019a ), and a change in one affects the others in different ways and degrees (Nilsson et al., 2018 ; Weitz, Carlsen, Nilsson, & Skanberg, 2017 ). Systemically, the SDGs comprise paradoxical tensions and compound contradictory yet interrelated and synergetic elements (Smith & Lewis, 2011 ) - i.e., the 17 goals and their 169 targets. These elements exist simultaneously, persist over time, and interact with a more extensive societal and planetary system. Trade-offs and synergies between the SDGs are contingent upon temporal interactions and countries' socioeconomic characteristics (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Investing in SDG 1 (No poverty) constitutes the most promising strategy to finally promote and start a virtuous cycle of SDGs progress (Kroll, Warchold, & Pradhan, 2019 ; Pradhan, 2019 ). More precisely, researchers found that focusing on poverty alleviation (SDG 1) in developing countries and reducing inequalities (SDG 10) in developed nations compound positive effects on all SDGs (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ; Lusseau & Mancini, 2019 ). Nevertheless, advancing SDGs 1 and 10 can constrain progress, if not cause a clash with SDG 12 (Sustainable consumption and production) and SDG 13 (Climate action). It is noteworthy that, despite improving subjective well-being (which references respondents’ self-evaluations of their own life), developments in SDGs 1 and 10 usually increase per capita material consumption, ecological footprint, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ). As institutional arrangements in low and high-income nations advance in socioeconomic issues and manage to lift millions out of poverty and reduce inequality nationally and across countries, they can create tensions and hinder progress on environmental-oriented SDGs. As an illustration, business-as-usual1 Business-as-usual represents a firm's orthodox economic view that pursues both maximizations of shareholders' profits and short-term performance by prioritizing economic outcomes to the detriment of social and environmental issues (Dyllick & Muff, 2016 ; Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, & Figge, 2014 ).  1   models to increase agricultural activities to support livestock are sources of global meat production and poverty alleviation, especially for the millions of undernourished and poorer farmers who live in low-income countries (FAO, 2019 ). However, overall livestock activities result in high levels of GHG emissions along with large scale land, freshwater, and energy use, causing significant impacts on biodiversity loss, natural habitat degradation, animal suffering, and diseases dissemination (Godfray et al., 2018 ; Graham & Abrahamse, 2017 ; Hashempour-Baltork, Khosravi-Darani, Hosseini, Farshi, & Reihani, 2020 ; Machovina, Feeley, & Ripple, 2015 ; Probst, BenYishay, Kontoleon, & dos Reis, 2020 ; Saget et al., 2021 ; UNEP, 2019a ; Weindl et al., 2017 ). This type of systemic trade-off creates tensions and a crossroads that mitigate our ability to meet multiple SDGs, intensify contradictions between socioeconomic and environmental goals, and disengage the inside progress of core business from the outside societal and planetary deterioration. In this struggling context between welfare and ecological sustainability, cultured meat represents a food innovation and disruptive technology that radically departs from environmental degradation and animal slaughter of livestock systems. It carries the promise to support an essential socio-technical transition to leverage a new cycle of ecological security and feed a growing world population with high-quality protein. This article advances research on the impact of cultured meat beyond environmental sustainability. It contributes to informing policymakers with novel perspectives to foster a virtuous cycle and outlines strategic business capabilities needed to deliver sustainable values in the scope of cultured meat responsibly.  3 Methodology This section presents an integrative literature review, a seven-point scale framework, and boundary conditions that have essential roles in the analysis and propositions on interactions between cultured meat and the SDGs. 3.1 Integrative review I conducted an integrative review (Torraco, 2016 ) with the support of Web of Science to find articles published until 2020 that could respond to the inquiry: what is the impact of cultured meat on the SDGs?  I filtered the search to the title and abstract, solely to articles published in peer-reviewed journals in English. The search involved a combination of two main variants of cultured meat (i.e., “cultured meat” OR “cultivated meat”). I found 75 articles and thoroughly read them (from abstract, introduction, literature review, and method to results, analysis, discussions, and conclusions). However, although some articles were relevant to some SDGs (e.g., some studies on lifecycle analyses), they neither addressed interactions of cultured meat with the SDGs nor answered the question of the impact of cultured meat on the SDGs. Therefore, I double-checked this literature gap by performing a broader search with the support of Web of Science, under the same filtering conditions as before, but comprising a more extensive combination of the many variants of cultured meat (Bryant & Barnett, 2019 ; Chriki & Hocquette, 2020 ) and the sustainable development goals: [(“cultured meat" OR "cultivated meat" OR “cultured beef” OR “in vitro meat” OR “artificial meat” OR “laboratory meat” OR “lab-grown meat” OR “synthetic meat” OR “cell-based meat” OR “clean meat” OR “animal free meat”) AND (“sustainable development goals” OR “Agenda 2030” OR sgd*)]. This search found no articles and thus confirmed the non-existence of studies that could answer the above inquiry on the impact of cultured meat on the SDGs. 3.1.1 Categorization of the 17 SDGs The organization of the 17 SDGs into environmental, economic, social, law, and health-oriented categories relied on a classification by De Neve and Sachs (2020) . Table 1   presents the resulting organization of the 17 goals into their respective categories. This classification facilitates a preliminary study on the interactions of cultured meat and the five SDGs categories, which starts from an integrative literature review and advances to content analysis, mapping interactions, discussions, and propositions.  3.1.2 Classification of the reviewed articles into SDGs categories First, I reoriented the integrative review inquiry to a new question: what is the impact of cultured meat on the environmental, health, social, economic, and law-oriented SDGs? Second, under the same filtering conditions as before, I conducted a new search with the support of Web of Science. The new search included combinations of the same two variants of cultured meat (“cultured meat” OR “cultivated meat”) and labels of the five SDGs categories, as illustrated in Table 2  . The new search resulted in a total of 50 articles that belong to one or more of the five SDGs categories and automatically discarded 25 articles that did not match the filtering criteria. Under the new search outlook, I thoroughly reviewed the 50 articles again since they are a subset of the 75 articles. On one side, I rejected 41 articles because they are focused on three other subjects that subsume customers’ perceptions and attitudes, philosophy and ethics, and technology of cultured meat. On the other side, I selected 9 articles since they are associated with at least one of the SDGs categories. Table 3   summarizes information about the 9 selected articles.  3.1.3 The process of categorization During content analysis (Krippendorff, 1980 ) of the 9 selected articles, I observed that some explicitly discuss sustainability concepts, even when mentioning distinct labels but similar meanings and functionalities. Other articles only presented cues that, when grouped, created meanings and functionalities associated with at least one of the sustainability domains. I also concluded that some other articles only attended partial characteristics and functionalities of prototype categories. In cognitive psychology, a prototype is the best model of a category that relies on categorization grades, where some members of a category are more central than others (Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976 ).   3.2 Seven-point scale framework to map interactions Table 4   presents a seven-point scale framework built on and adapted from Nilsson et al. (2016 , 2018) , which assists decisions about the nature and the strength of interaction of cultured meat with an SDG (or an SDG category). In addition to this framework, judgment relies on the integrative review results, sustainability science and UN publications, and content analysis of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets (UN, 2015 ). The nature can be associated with synergetic (or positive), neutral, or trade-off (or negative) interactions, and the strength can vary from being very much positive (+3) to very much negative (−3). The interaction strength between cultured meat and an SDG category results from the average calculus of the individual strengths of the interactions of cultured meat with the respective SDGs in the category. For instance, the interaction strength between cultured meat and the environmental category results from the average interaction strengths between cultured meat and the SDGs 2, 6–7, and 11–15.  3.3 Preambular and boundary conditions The premises presented in this subsection influence the analysis and the propositions. The first premise is about temporality and interdependence. The analysis of the interactions is grounded in the SDGs of Agenda 2030, which references medium-term prospects. However, on some occasions, I refer to short and long-term perspectives that represent approximate periods of five and twenty years, respectively. Furthermore, the SDGs compound contradictory yet interrelated and synergetic elements that simultaneously persist over time and interact with an extensive societal and planetary system. The second premise relies on estimates which demonstrate that cultured meat will grow from 0% to 10%–35% of global meat consumption from 2025 to 2030 to 2040, respectively, while conventional meat supply will drop by more than 33% by 2040 (Gerhardt et al., 2019 ). The third premise relies on research results on land use and climate impacts of food in 2050 under different livestock scenarios. Röös et al. (2017 , p.10) showed that “without improvements in crop productivity or reductions on today's waste levels, available cropland will only suffice if production of all protein currently supplied by animal foods is replaced by artificial variants not requiring any land” albeit being an implausible future. As indicated by estimates of 2030 and 2040 (Gerhardt et al., 2019 ), cultured meat is expected to share (but neither replace nor disrupt entirely) the global meat market currently dominated by livestock systems. Hence, cultured meat is a highly credible source of high-quality protein that promises to reduce land and water use and current global food climate impacts. The fourth premise relies on sustainability science results that demonstrate how SDGs priorities change by socioeconomic region (Lusseau & Mancini, 2019 ). Moreover, the relative contributions of the SDGs to sustainable development and well-being differ by country income (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ). Therefore, prioritizing SDG 1 (No poverty) in low-income countries and SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities) in high-income nations will have compounded positive effects on all SDGs (Kroll et al., 2019 ; Lusseau & Mancini, 2019 ; Pradhan, 2019 ) - apart from SDG 12 and SDG 13 which are negatively correlated with well-being underlay by large per capita ecological footprint and high GHG emissions (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ).   4 Integrative review results This section comprises two processes. The first involves assessing distributions of the 50 reviewed articles per subject and sustainability domain. The second involves identifying the 9 selected articles’ views about the benefits and challenges of cultured meat and organizing them into sustainability domains. 4.1 Distributions per subject and sustainability domain Distributions were built upon the integrative review results and with the support of the Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics). Figs. 1 and 2    respectively illustrate the distributions of the 41 rejected articles per subject and the 9 selected articles per sustainability domain. According to Fig. 1 , customers' perception and attitude, philosophy and ethics, and technology of cultured meat scored respectively 26, 11, and 4 of the 41 rejected articles. This result demonstrates that customers' acceptance of cultured meat is a top research area among the three leading subjects found in the 41 rejected articles. Regarding Fig. 2 , environmental, health, social, economic, and law-oriented sustainability domains scored 8, 4, 3, 3, 2 of the 9 selected articles. This result implies that the environmental impact of cultured meat is the most popular among the sustainability domains in the literature.  4.2 Benefits and challenges of cultured meat Table 5   presents the literature perspectives about cultured meat's benefits and challenges organized into the five individual sustainability domains (i.e., environmental, health, social, economic, and law). When applicable, Table 5  distinguishes the benefits and challenges in low- and high-income countries (as well as in less- and more-intensive agriculture/livestock nations). Regional features were mentioned in and deduced from the 9 selected articles. While a sustainability domain has the same label as an SDG-oriented category, they have different conceptions. The first relies on general sustainability concepts (UNWCED, 1987 ), whereas the second is grounded in the specificities of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets (UN, 2015 ). Whereas sustainability domains are necessary to organize the integrative literature review, the SDGs-oriented categories are essential in analyzing the map of interactions between cultured meat and the SDGs. According to Table 5 , cultured meat's environmental, health, and law benefits apply to all countries regardless of socioeconomic or regional differences. Because reduction in energy use depends on developments and a bold transition to renewable energy sources (Sinke & Odegard, 2021 ; Tuomisto & Teixeira de Mattos, 2011 ), the energy issue is a challenge. The social and economic domains comprise benefits and challenges that vary according to regional differences but depend upon our acceptance of temporality and interdependence among the sustainability issues. For instance, business-as-usual frameworks that solely prioritize foods' economic domain can favor short-term performance but be detrimental to long-term outcomes such as systemic resilience and planetary security. In contrast, acknowledging an integrative view that accepts and resolves contradictory yet interrelated sustainability domains to attend to competing demands simultaneously can fuel a virtuous cycle of sustainable development (Hahn et al., 2014 , 2015 ; Smith & Lewis, 2011 ).   5 Analysis and propositions on interactions Table 6   presents the map of interactions that portrays the impact of cultured meat on the 17 SDGs and their five categories. This map relied on multiple knowledge sources - integrative literature review results, sustainability science and UN publications, content analysis of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets – that fed the seven-point scale framework that assisted the judgment about the nature and the strengths of the interactions. Indeed, the map in Table 6  also relied on a significantly systemic and paradoxical view of the SDGs. Because the 17 SDGs are integrated and interdependent, so are their categories. A change in one can affect the others in different ways and degrees. Indeed, the SDGs compound “contradictory yet interrelated” categories “that exist simultaneously and persist over time”. These categories (or elements or dualities) “seem logical when considered in isolation” but “inconsistent, and absurd when juxtaposed” (Smith & Lewis, 2011 , p. 387). Spurring a virtuous cycle to fuel sustainable development will become more powerful when confronting and juxtaposing the SDGs categories. Indeed, confronting and juxtaposing involves splitting (or separating) and integrating (or synthesizing) them continuously and dynamically (Hahn et al., 2015 ). This process enables accepting and resolving paradoxical tensions, exploring synergies, and fueling a virtuous cycle of SDGs and well-being within and across the North-South. 5.1 Impact of cultured meat on environmental-oriented SDGs Medium-term projections for global meat production from 2021 to 2030 indicate an expansion of nearly 44 million tons, reaching 373 million tons in 2030 (OECD-FAO, 2021 , p. 168). Furthermore, medium-term estimates for cultured meat suggest it will share 10% of the global meat market by 2030 (Gerhardt et al., 2019 ). Under such circumstances, cultured meat will represent approximately 37.3 of the 373 million tons of the global market in 2030. These estimates associated with fast technological developments (Jairath et al., 2021 ; Parodi et al., 2018 ) indicate a continuously and increasingly important role of cultured meat in the global food value chain, particularly in the progress of environmental-oriented SDGs. Cultured meat creates conditions that further the SDG 2. In balance with Target 2.4  (UN, 2015 , p. 15), cultured meat is a promising technological source of sustainable food production that favors the maintenance of ecosystems and strengths food security and resilience, especially under extreme weather, climate change, flood, and other disasters. Target 2.c  also favors a proper alignment between cultured meat and SDG 2. Because cultured meat involves producing food under highly controlled conditions (Chriki & Hocquette, 2020 ), its technological capabilities can “facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility” (UN, 2015 , p. 16). Cultured meat is strongly linked to the reinforcement and benefit of SDG 6. Climate change is likely to function as a malefic source of transformation and deterioration of life on earth that involves hindering progress on access to safely managed water and sanitation and causing food insecurity and undernutrition worldwide (UNESCO, 2020 ). Agriculture uses more freshwater than any other human activity, and nearly a third of this is required for livestock (Godfray et al., 2018 ). The fact that cultured meat has the potential to save from 82 to 96% of the water use in livestock systems (Tuomisto & Teixeira de Mattos, 2011 ) makes it a promising future food technology that can ensure availability and stimulate sustainable management of water to find a better alignment with the SDG 6. In this view, cultured meat can benefit Targets 6.4 , 6.5,  and 6.6  since it fosters water security, quality, and efficiency by “reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally” as well as by encouraging the protection of water ecosystems (UN, 2015 , p. 18). Cultured meat creates conditions that further the SDG 7. Because cultured meat has the potential to save from 7 to 45 percent of the energy use in livestock (Tuomisto & Teixeira de Mattos, 2011 ), it features a promising food innovation that can improve global energy efficiency and find a better alignment with Target 7.3  (UN, 2015 , p. 19), mainly stimulating the adoption of clean energy technology. Cultured meat creates conditions that further the SDG 11, and most specifically the Target 11.a , since it encourages the development of new business that positively and responsibly tackles economic, social, and environmental linkages and challenges between “urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning” (UN, 2015 , p. 22). In this view, cultured meat can alleviate the extensive land and water use and contamination risks by livestock and release resources needed to improve life quality in urban and rural areas. In addition, cultured meat can stimulate the integration, protection, and restoration of natural ecosystems within, between, and around the boundaries of cities. Cultured meat is inextricably and very much strongly linked to the benefit of SDGs 12, 13, 14, and 15. From 2021 to 2030, overall global meat consumption is expected to rise 14 percent driven by increasing average individual incomes and population growth, especially in developing countries (Godfray et al., 2018 ; OECD-FAO, 2021 , p. 164). Livestock production uses 77 percent of agricultural land for feed production, pasture, and grazing (UNEP, 2019a ) and imposes a high food, water, and biodiversity insecurity. In this context, cultured meat can technologically disrupt livestock systems’ vicious and debilitative cycle. Indeed, it brings the promise to alleviate natural resources deterioration since it stimulates sustainable consumption and production patterns (SDG 12), promotes new urgent actions to combat climate change and its impacts (SDG 13), and reduces both marine pollution (SDG 14) and natural habitats degradation (SDG 15). Examples of targets well aligned with the environmental benefits of cultured meat include: Target 12.2  [“By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources”]; Target 13.1  [“Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries”]; Target 14.1 [“By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution”]; and Target 15.5  [“Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species”] (UN, 2015 ). Despite referring to 2020, the evolution of Target 15.5  must be updated annually until 2030. This subsection corroborated the integrative review results and sustainability science publications and demonstrated that cultured meat creates opportunities that foster progress in the environmental-oriented SDGs. I suggest that:Proposition 1 Cultured meat is strongly linked to the reinforcement and benefit of the Environmental-oriented SDGs since it creates synergies ensuring sustainable food production (SDG 2), economizing water (SDGs 6) and energy use (SDG 7), stimulating ecosystems protection (SDG 11), promoting sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12), combating climate change and strengthening resilience (SDG 13), reducing marine pollution (SDG 14) and natural habitats degradation (SDG 15).    The following discussion evidences the importance and influence of the environmental-oriented SDGs to benefit the other categories that comprise health, social, economic, and law-oriented goals.  5.2 Impact of cultured meat on health-oriented SDGs Cell-based or cultured systems involve producing meat with the support of bioreactors that operate under fully controlled conditions of temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen, and carbon dioxide (Post et al., 2020 ). This process protects cultured meat from the outside threats of pathogen contaminations and zoonotic diseases (Chriki & Hocquette, 2020 ; Espinosa, Tago, & Treich, 2020 ; Jairath et al., 2021 ). Cultured meat is strongly linked to the reinforcement and benefit of SDG 3, especially regarding Target 3.9  [“By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination”] (UN, 2015 , p. 16). The environmental impact of cultured meat reinforces health benefits. Climate change, air pollution, and natural environment devastation have direct and indirect negative impacts on global health, including mental, respiratory, cardiovascular, infectious, and water-borne diseases and undernutrition, injuries, allergies, poisoning, and heat stroke (UN-WHO, 2018 ). Indeed, mortality associated with rising temperatures attributable to recent anthropogenic warming is one of the impactful fingerprints of a rapidly changing climate in a fast-paced changing world (Mitchell, 2021 ; Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021 ). Deforestation is a significant cause of biodiversity loss and a source of negative impact on human health. Morand and Lajaunie (2021)  found that from 1990 to 2016, increases in outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases were linked to deforestation. Mori et al. (2021)  found that global impacts of biodiversity loss and climate change are interlinked, and biodiversity represents a nature-based climate solution. Investments in environmental-oriented SDGs - that comprise improvements in ecosystems preservation, reduction in GHG emissions, and economy in water, land, and energy use - will enable long-term progress on health issues associated with SDG 3. For this reason, the environmental benefits of cultured meat will fuel progress in global health. This subsection demonstrated that cultured meat creates synergies that foster progress on health-oriented SDGs, corroborating the integrative review results and sustainability science publications. Environmental and health goals are intimately and powerfully connected elements. I suggest that:Proposition 2a Cultured meat is strongly linked to the reinforcement and benefit of the Health-oriented SDGs since it creates synergies ensuring healthy lives and potentially reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals, air pollution, and water and soil contamination (SDG 3).   Proposition 2b Because cultured meat is strongly linked to the reinforcement and benefit of Environmental-oriented SDGs,  it will fuel synergies with Health-oriented SDGs.     5.3 Impact of cultured meat on social-oriented SDGs In the medium- and long-term, cultured meat's environmental and health benefits can fuel a virtuous cycle to overcome the (atemporal) social problems raised by some articles in the integrative literature review. Social goals involve eliminating poverty (SDG 1), achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls (SDG 5), and reducing inequality within and across countries (SDG 10). They can have a significant impact on multiple SDGs. Prioritizing poverty alleviation in less developed countries and reducing inequalities (and relative poverty) in more developed nations will positively affect all SDGs (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ; Lusseau & Mancini, 2019 ). The integrative review results suggested the existence of both benefits and challenges of cultured meat to social issues. On one view, regardless of regional differences, cultured meat promotes public health, avoids pathogenic contaminations, and thus reduces the risks of pandemics and other social problems (Espinosa et al., 2020 ; Jairath et al., 2021 ; Tomiyama et al., 2020 ). On the other view, particularly in developing and intensive agriculture/livestock nations, cultured meat can cause unemployment, poverty, and inequality (Jairath et al., 2021 ; Bryant, 2020 ), over-urbanization that leads to a decline in per capita of the city, unaffordability by the poor, people's mistrust and skepticism, and technological misuse (Tomiyama et al., 2020 ; Welin, 2013 ). As such, how to address the cultured meat impact on the social-oriented SDGs  is an unanswered and complex inquiry. Instead of searching for a direct linkage, we can deduce indirect connections and relationships intermediated by other interdependent goals. Cultured meat's benefits for poverty alleviation, gender equality, and inequality reduction become salient when confronting and juxtaposing environmental- and health-with the social-oriented SDGs. Judging the social implications of a sluggish global economy shaped by the COVID-19 outbreak, United Nations’ experts estimated three scenarios where global poverty could increase for the first time since 1990. The scenarios included low, medium, and high contractions in per capita household income or consumption, ranging from 5 to 10 to 20 percent, resulting in profound implications for global monetary poverty (Sumner, Hoy, & Ortiz-Juarez, 2020 ). The impact of the three scenarios on the poverty headcount was calculated using the international poverty lines of US$1.90, US$3.20, and US$5.50 per day. “Under the most extreme scenario of a 20 per cent income or consumption contraction, the number of people living in poverty could increase by 420–580 million, relative to the latest official recorded figures for 2018” (Sumner et al., 2020 , p. 2). This means the COVID-19 pandemic imposed substantial barriers and disruptions to businesses, global economy, and society (Guan et al., 2020 ; UNCTAD, 2020a, UNCTAD, 2020b)  and exposed “the fragility of the SDGs” (Naidoo & Fisher, 2020 , p. 198). On a perspective of the social impact of climate change, publications of UN-WHO (2018)  stated that: “Climate change is considered to be a poverty multiplier, which could force 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030.” (p.25); and “Climate change undermines the social and environmental determinants of health, including people's access to clean air, safe drinking-water, sufficient food and secure shelter.” (p.8), particularly in the poorest, most vulnerable communities. According to UN-WHO (2014) , gender, climate change, and health are significantly and subtly interconnected elements. The adverse effects of climate change on health are strongly influenced by individual and population factors, including age and gender (with women, children, and the elderly often at higher risky and vulnerable conditions). During droughts, women and children in less developed countries are often the most affected by nutritional deficiency and the burdens associated with their normative and cultural duties in household services and other tasks like water collection in remote sources. Other evidence indicates that droughts can disproportionately stimulate male farmers to commit suicide (UN-WHO, 2014 , p. 21). Indeed, global warming and air pollution are sources of mortality, food insecurity, and diseases that mainly stress vulnerable populations by overshooting the need for medical treatment and hospitalization (Mitchell, 2021 ). Investing in environmental goals can foster long-term progress on social-oriented SDGs. After conducting a content analysis of the SDGs 1, 5, and 10, I found that cultured meat can stimulate progress on, but not limited to: Target 1.5  [“By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters”] (UN, 2015 , p. 15); Target 5.1  [“End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere”] (p.18); and Target 10.3  [“Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard”] (p.21). Because environmental and health benefits of cultured meat can favor progress on social issues, they can create synergies with SDGs 1, 5, and 10. I suggest that:Proposition 3a Cultured meat creates conditions that further the Social-oriented SDGs since it fuels synergies building the resilience of the low-income and vulnerable communities to climate change impacts and other economic, social, and environmental outbreaks (SDG 1), stimulating gender equality (SDG 5), and promoting equal opportunity, appropriate policies, and reduced inequality (SDG 10).   Proposition 3b Because cultured meat is strongly linked to the reinforcement and benefit of Environmental and Health-oriented SDGs, it will fuel synergies with Social-oriented SDGs.     5.4 Impact of cultured meat on economic-oriented SDGs Potential and attractive medium- and long-term economic benefits can result from tackling climate change, health, and social issues. “Climate change affects every aspect of society, from the health of the global economy to the health of our children.” (UN-WHO, 2014 , p. 4). I argue that the environmental, health and social benefits of cultured meat can fuel a virtuous cycle that overcomes the (atemporal) economic problems raised in some of the articles of the integrative literature review. Savings from climate change, biodiversity loss, air pollution, water and land misuse and contamination, energy inefficiency, diseases and pandemic outbreaks, and social conflicts could be applied to advance progress in economic-oriented SDGs. In 2013, exposure to air pollution provoked as many as one in eight premature deaths worldwide, costing nearly US$ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses (UN-WHO, 2018 , p. 52; World Bank Group, 2016 ). Outdoor air pollution is estimated to be the cause of 5–10 percent of the annual premature deaths in the United States (Dedoussi, Eastham, Monier, & Barrett, 2020 ). While from 2002 to 2017, China's GDP – gross domestic product – grew approximately 284%, this performance was accompanied by a highly unprecedented overshoot in energy consumption and air pollution-related premature mortalities – nearly 0,39 million – despite creating significant investments in end-of-pipe technologies and policies (Geng et al., 2021 ). From 2015 to 2017, the economic value of health losses in China cost an average of 4% of its GDP, and in some urban agglomerated areas around Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, it nearly accounted for 21.88% of their total economic value (Guan, Kang, Wang, Zhang, & Ju, 2019 ). Since 2013, China has implemented a large-scale project to systematically deliver renewable energy technology through solar photovoltaic systems that have reduced poverty and fostered economic productivity, especially in rural areas (Zhang, Wu, et al., 2020 ). UN estimated that US$ 270 billion a year (for 15 years) would be the approximate investment in a low-carbon economy needed to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement (UNCC, 2015 ), whereas keeping an orthodox business-as-usual model grounded in high-carbon would cost an estimated US$ 90 trillion per year in infrastructure investment and maintenance (UN-WHO, 2018 , p. 52). Naumann et al. (2021 , p.485) argued that “in the absence of climate action (4 °C in 2100 and no adaptation), annual drought losses in the European Union and the United Kingdom combined are projected to rise to more than €65 billion per year compared with €9 billion per year currently …” and that, under this condition, regional agriculture economic output would be reduced by 10% in southern and western regions of Europe. Naidoo and Fisher (2020)  explained that the COVID-19 outbreak imposed new challenges on the SDGs. They estimated that “two-thirds are now unlikely to be met” because of a slowdown in the global economy (p.198). United Nations declared that “the pandemic has unleashed a health and economic crisis unprecedented in scope and magnitude” and estimated that the world cumulative output losses were nearly 8.5 trillion US dollars between 2020 and 2021 (UNDESA, 2020a , p. 23). Considerable savings can be accumulated by focusing on environmental, health, and social-oriented goals to foster long-term progress on the economic-oriented SDGs 4, 8, and 9. For example, cultured meat can favor progress on, but not limited to: Target 4.1  [“By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes”] (UN, 2015 , p. 17); Target 8.4  [“Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed countries taking the lead”] (p.19); and Target 9.4  [“By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities”] (p.20). Because environmental and health benefits of cultured meat can favor progress on social and economic issues, they can create synergies with SDGs 4, 8, and 9. I suggest that:Proposition 4a Cultured meat creates conditions that further the Economic-oriented SDGs since it fuels synergies promoting sustainable development learning opportunities for all (SDG 4), endeavoring to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation (SDG 8), and increasing the adoption of clean technologies and cleaner production (SDG 9).   Proposition 4b Because cultured meat is strongly linked to the reinforcement and benefit of Environmental and Health-oriented SDGs, it will fuel synergies with Social and Economic-oriented SDGs.     5.5 Impact of cultured meat on law-oriented SDGs Some authors argue that regulation of cultured meat consumption and production can shape consumer's perception and improve the market's acceptability of this new food technology (Espinosa et al., 2020 ; Jairath et al., 2021 ; Stephens et al., 2018 ; Tomiyama et al., 2020 ). There is continuing interest in how policies contribute to achieving SDGs (UNEP, 2019b ). Indeed, governing the ambitious shift to a sustainable development pathway requires peace, responsible national and global institutions, and extensive international cooperation (Soergel et al., 2021 ). Formulating and strengthening laws that guide sustainable consumption and production patterns will support responsible national and international policies to foster progress in multiple targets, goals, and categories. New laws should comprise systemic policy frameworks that advance sustainable development issues, focusing on environmental goals and enabling health, social, and economic progress (Rafaj et al., 2018 ). Cultured meat creates conditions that further the law-oriented SDGs. It can favor progress on, but not limited to: Target 16.b  [“Promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies for sustainable development”] (UN, 2015 , p. 26); Target 17.6  [“Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms …”] (p.26); and Target 17.14  [“Enhance policy coherence for sustainable development”] (p.27). As cultured meat fuels progress on environmental, health, economic, and social goals, they will further the law-oriented SDGs. This latter category can favor policies to foster intensive investments in environmental goals to promote a virtuous cycle of sustainable development from North to South and vice versa. I propose that:Proposition 5a Cultured meat creates conditions that further the Law-oriented SDGs since it fuels synergies promoting non-discriminatory laws for sustainable development (SDG 16) and enhancing policy coherence for sustainable development (SDG 17).   Proposition 5b Because cultured meat is strongly linked to the reinforcement and benefit of Environmental and Health-oriented SDGs that synergize Social and Economic targets, it will fuel developments in Law-oriented SDGs that, in turn, will channel, shape, and boost new cycles of SDGs progress.    Moving from Proposition 1   to Proposition 5b  , I suggest that:Proposition 6 Cultured meat systems will be more effective in unleashing a virtuous cycle of SDGs progress from North to South and  vice versa when confronting and juxtaposing environmental, health, social, economic, and law-oriented goals.     5.6 Impact of cultured meat on well-being Developments in SDGs 1 and 10 can boost short-term peaks of well-being but usually increase per capita material consumption, ecological footprint, and GHG emissions, which shape society and the planet with a vicious cycle of long-term damages. Welfare has relied mainly on economic growth and consumption at the expense of environmental sustainability, driven by national and international business organizations and other institutional arrangements (Folke et al., 2019 ; Wade & Rekker, 2020 ; Zhang, Guan, et al., 2020 ). At the global level, most SDGs - with particular attention to SDGs 1 and 10 - correlate strongly and positively with higher well-being, apart from SDGs 12 and 13, which correlate negatively with well-being to a greater extent in high-income nations (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ). High-income or developed countries usually have a high SDG index score - with the Nordics topping the ranking (Sachs et al., 2020 ) - and tend to perform better well-being. However, the general correlation between the SDGs and well-being is significantly lower for most less-developed nations (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ). In low-income regions, well-being can stagnate (if not deteriorate) when countries find their limits to growth - as such, focusing on poverty alleviation and economic development will have a more significant impact on well-being in less developed nations, even as short-term peak performance. Indeed, more developed countries must reduce their ecological footprint to allow for increased consumption in developing countries that are in the pursuit of meeting basic needs. According to Kuznets2  2 Kuznets (1955)  hypothesized an inverted U-shaped curve of income versus  inequality. When per capita income increases, the inequality also increases until reaching a threshold or turning point, after which the inequality starts to decrease while the per capita income increases keeps increasing.   (1955), as a country's economy develops and per capita rises, inequality decreases after a turning point (Pradhan, 2019 ), and the well-being of its citizens stagnates (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ) to the extent that their material aspiration increases along with income over the life cycle (Easterlin, 2001 ). Under an environmental and health lens, well-being stagnates or deteriorates when (for instance) people are exposed to climate-change extreme events, heatwaves, air pollution, flooding, droughts, water contamination, and other insecure issues, even if they are perceiving and experiencing high rates of economic growth and material consumption (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ). Reducing the environmental costs of economic growth and flattening an income-environment relationship hypothesized as an inverted U-shaped curve - well-known as the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) - will depend upon better policies and institutions to “removing environmentally harmful subsidies, internalizing externalities, and ensuring a clear definition of and enforcement of property rights over natural resources” (Panayotou, 1997 , p. 468). These vicious cycles of well-being stagnation that persist within and across the North and the South constitute substantial barriers to achieving the SDGs. They will be interrupted to start a virtuous sustainable development cycle as national and global organizations and political institutions strengthen and accelerate ambitious packages that encompass significant investments to alleviate tensions and fuel synergies between socioeconomic and environmental goals. A package could comprise global warming policies, North-South economic development, education, international climate finance, progressive redistribution of carbon pricing revenues, sufficient and healthy nutrition, improved access to renewable energy technologies in developing regions, and less resource-intensive lifestyles in industrialized economies (Soergel et al., 2021 ). Moreover, this package should involve massively rolling out environmentally efficient technologies across all sectors and radically changing production, consumption, and waste patterns – regardless of regional differences – to sufficiency levels (Millward-Hopkins, Steinberger, Rao, & Oswald, 2020 ). Some authors outline the need to foster investments in sustainable infrastructure sectors of energy, transport, water, solid waste, and digital communications, which can directly or indirectly impact 72% of the SDGs targets (Adshead, Thacker, Fuldauer, & Hall, 2019 ; Thacker et al., 2019 ). Starting a virtuous cycle will boost progress on multiple SDGs from the top to the bottom of socioeconomic strata and vice versa. In this transition, developing countries will need a twofold investment to boost progress on SDG 1. Whereas one source can originate from the scarce resources of the bottom, the other must flow from international support of the higher top strata to enhance progress in developing and low-income countries, starting from SDG 1 and stimulating synergies with the other SDGs from North to South and the other way around. Targets 17.3  and 17.9 , among others, encourage this approach since they declare the need to “Mobilize additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources” and “Enhance international support for implementing effective and targeted capacity-building in developing countries to support national plans to implement all the Sustainable Development Goals, including through North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation” (UN, 2015, p. 26–27). High-income nations will need to lead and transfer developments, for example, in sustainability-oriented innovations (Adams, Jeanrenaud, Bessant, David Denyer, & Overy, 2016 ) to fuel a low-carbon economy flowing across North-South and South-South regions. Targets 8.4  and 17.7  encourage this cycle, with the first declaring the need to “decouple economic growth from environmental degradation” (UN, 2015 , p. 19) and the second underlining the importance to “Promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favorable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed” (UN, 2015 , p. 26). This is a promising strategy to spark a virtuous cycle to enable systemic resilience and long-term progress on the SDGs. I suggest that:Proposition 7a Cultured meat systems will favor well-being in developing countries if they stimulate responsible decisions and actions that promote poverty alleviation and economic development [with socioeconomic and technological support that flows from North to South cooperation].   Proposition 7b Cultured meat systems will favor well-being in developed countries if they stimulate responsible  decisions and actions that further inequality reduction and resource efficiency to decouple economic development from environmental degradation and global warming.   Propositions 7c Cultured meat systems will boost a virtuous cycle of sustainable development and well- being  in developing and developed nations if they simultaneously address ‘SDGs 1 and 10’ to boost short-term performance and ‘SDGs 12 and 13’ to create long-term outcomes within and across the North-South.    In this perspective, the social and the environmental goals are dualities or elements that “seem logical when considered in isolation” but inconsistent and conflicting when confronted and juxtaposed (Smith & Lewis, 2011 , p. 387). Moreover, by accepting and resolving tensions between the short-term (socioeconomic) and the long-term (planetary) goals, policymakers can explore synergies that spur sustainable development by continuously and cyclically splitting and integrating these dualities. However, resolving does not suggest canceling tensions over time but finding a means of meeting competing demands amenably and simultaneously (Hahn et al., 2015 ). Fig. 3   depicts a synthesis of the Propositions   (from 1   to 7c  ). The first part illustrates a virtuous cycle of SDGs that flows by juxtaposing environmental, health, social, economic, and law goals. The second part shows elements or dualities – the socioeconomic (SDGs 1 and 10) and the environmental (SDGs 12 and 13) pairs – which seem individually favorable but conflicting when juxtaposed within the same temporal line. However, a separation strategy facilitates the management of the paradoxical tension by splitting these two categories temporally and spacially – i.e., separating these socioeconomic and environmental opposite goals and locating them at different points in time (in the short and long run) from North to South. By splitting dualities, we can alleviate tensions and explore synergies integrating short- and long-term strategies to foster a virtuous cycle in the North-South. Finally, the third part illustrates an integrative view of a virtuous cycle to fuel sustainable development within and across the global North-South. As such, Fig. 3  represents a system in which cultured meat can significantly spur sustainable development.   6 Future research directions This work opens fruitful research avenues on the implications of cultured meat for sustainable development and renders new research gaps salient. I suggest further research in two directions: (a) How can business sustainability (Bansal & DesJardine, 2014 ; Dyllick & Muff, 2016 ; Hart & Milstein, 2003 ) address grand societal challenges (George et al., 2016 ; Howard-Grenville et al., 2019 ) associated with cultured meat and other future food systems? How do sustainable businesses inform cultured meat? (b) How do other alternative protein technologies - such as insect, microbe, and plant-sourced foods (Alexander et al., 2017 ; Parodi et al., 2018 ; Takefuji, 2021 ; Van der Weele et al., 2019 ) - impact the SDGs? How do they add to and compete with cultured meat regarding the SDGs? How does a mixture or combination of future foods impact the SDGs? Concerning the first avenue on the need for business sustainability to foster cultured meat, I have some words to start this important topic here. 6.1 The need for business sustainability in cultured meat systems Rationales for business sustainability.   Understanding grand societal challenges such as poverty, inequality, natural resource scarcity, and global warming underline the importance of organizing new business and management models to address the SDGs (George et al., 2016 ; Howard-Grenville et al., 2019 ). In this vein, we need to drive a substantial shift from business-as-usual and elementary business sustainability3  3 ‘Elementary business sustainability’ references the business organization in the pursuit of incremental changes to alleviate internal tensions, meet shareholder's expectations, and Triple Bottom Line short-term outcomes. It is part of the typology presented by Dyllick and Muff (2016)  that comprises “Refined Shareholder Value Management” (1.0), “Managing for the Triple Bottom Line” (2.0), and “True Sustainability” (3.0), respectively.   towards true business sustainability that aims to connect the outside challenges of society and the planet to the inside of the firm's core strategy to address the disconnect between “micro-level progress and macro-level deterioration” (Dyllick & Muff, 2016 ). Indeed, business sustainability is about the ability of firms (and other arrangements) to attend to their short-term outcomes “without compromising their (and others') ability to meet their future needs” (Bansal & DesJardine, 2014 , p. 71). A sustainable business addresses global challenges associated with sustainable development by simultaneously managing intertemporal tensions between the short- and long-term and resource tensions between its internal and external (business) environment (Hart & Milstein, 2003 ). A sustainable business pursues long-term outcomes by acknowledging, accommodating, and resolving paradoxical tensions – i.e., contradictory yet interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time - to attend to competing demands simultaneously (Hahn et al., 2015 ; Smith & Lewis, 2011 ). Because the SDGs comprise paradoxical tensions - especially between socioeconomic and environmental-oriented goals (De Neve & Sachs, 2020 ) – businesses and organizations need capabilities to foster acceptance and resolution of them rather than encouraging a defensive strategy (Hahn et al., 2015 ). Capabilities are mechanisms by which businesses and organizations can shape and address the SDGs. How does business sustainability inform cultured meat?   Despite being suggested as a promising food innovation (Post et al., 2020 ), the technological capabilities of cultured meat, by themselves, might not be sufficient to promote a socio-technical transition towards a more sustainable future that also requires addressing social, regulatory, political, and institutional issues (Stephens et al., 2018 ; Van der Weele et al., 2019 ). Cultured meat technology also needs to be embraced by a truly sustainable business that offers capabilities to fuel Pollution Prevention (PP), Product Stewardship (PS), Clean Technology (CT), and Sustainability Vision (SV) to create sustainable values that go beyond the firm's competitive advantage4  4 Competitive advantage centers on firms' resources and abilities to overcome competitors and add profits to shareholders (Barney, 1991 ). In contrast, sustainable value involves subjective and objective measurements of well-being (Kraatz, Flores, & Chandler, 2020 ) and applies to the benefit of stakeholders, society, and the planet (Freudenreich, Lüdeke-Freund, & Schaltegger, 2020 ; Hart & Milstein, 2003 ).   (Hart, 1995 ; Hart & Milstein, 2003 ; Hart & Dowell, 2011 ). PP involves minimizing pollution, consumption, and waste in the firms' production systems and fostering cost reduction. For example, reusing recycled water and adopting renewable energy sources to prevent GHG emissions will minimize fossil fuel consumption and reduce waste from cultured meat production systems. PS involves expanding PP across the firms' local and global supply chains and integrating stakeholders' voices into the product design and development processes. PS comprises listening to stakeholders (e.g., public and private sectors, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other institutions and partners) and connecting the business to the society with transparency to foster confidence, reputation, and legitimacy. For example, using life cycle assessment and reports to communicate the impact of cultured meat products on economic, social, and environmental issues, and fueling local and international partnerships to accept cultured meat. Indeed, PS-driven firms must create balance and synergy between short-term efficiency and systemic resilience. In this view, cultured meat systems need to develop sustainable businesses that “Engage in institutional change and actively seek to shape institutional expectations in favor of more sustainable business practices” (Hahn et al., 2015 , p. 304). CT involves developing the competencies of tomorrow's sustainable technologies and markets that foster disruptive innovations. For example, developing efficient and renewable energy-driven bioreactors that will favor large-scale cultured meat production. SV involves minor strategic capabilities needed to create new markets to address poverty, inequality, and other grand societal challenges, especially by serving the poor at the (socioeconomic) Bottom of the Pyramid – BoP (London & Hart, 2011 ; Nobre & Morais da Silva, 2021 , pp. 1–42). SV favors consumers' (and the poor's) affordability, availability, acceptability, and awareness (Anderson & Markides, 2007 ) of the new food technology in the global market. Indeed, SV promotes: (i) creating buying power by providing the poor with access to microcredit, income generation, and local entrepreneurship; (ii) shaping aspirations by educating consumers about sustainable development and responsible consumption; (iii) tailoring local solutions by developing innovations to the benefit of the poor and that can move from the bottom to the top of the socioeconomic pyramid; and (iv) improving access of the poor to the products and services in a culturally sensitive, environmentally responsible, and economically profitable way (Prahalad & Hart, 2002 ). For example, developing inclusive business models to foster entrepreneurship, responsible consumption, and responsible innovations (Nobre & Morais da Silva, 2021 , pp. 1–42) to fuel a virtuous cycle from the bottom to the top of the socioeconomic strata in the scope of cultured meat. Accordingly, these (i.e., PP, PS, SV, and CP) are capabilities needed to enable businesses and organizations to create sustainable values for society and the planet. Researchers, entrepreneurs, managers, and policymakers should acknowledge and embrace these capabilities into new sustainable businesses to foster a responsible introduction and dissemination of cultured meat in the global society and market. Despite comprising technologies to implement a sustainable food innovation, cultured meat still lacks truly sustainable businesses that simultaneously develop pollution prevention, product stewardship, sustainability vision (or bottom of the pyramid), and clean technology capabilities. I propose that:Proposition 8 Cultured meat systems will have more significant potential to benefit society and the planet, from North to South, if they embrace truly sustainable businesses' capabilities to address SDGs' grand challenges.      7 Conclusions This article contributed with significant analysis and foundational propositions that opened novel perspectives to assist managers and policymakers' strategic decisions on the nature and the strengths of the interactions between cultured meat and the SDGs in the short and long run. This research shed new light to advance knowledge on tackling grand societal challenges about Agenda 2030. Cultured meat represents a promising clean technology and sustainable food innovation that can stimulate virtuous cycles in developing and developed nations. Indeed, cultured meat will be more effective in fueling SDGs progress when confronting and juxtaposing environmental, health, social, economic, and law-oriented goals. Furthermore, it will be more successful in fostering well-being when focusing on SDGs 1 and 10 to boost short-term performance and investing in SDGs 12 and 13 to create long-term outcomes within and across the North-South. Policymakers can resolve tensions and explore synergies between the short-term (socioeconomic) and the long-term (planetary) goals to foster systemic resilience and sustainability by continuously and cyclically splitting and integrating these dualities. However, while cultured meat comprises technological capabilities to implement a future food innovation, we should not obscure that it lacks sustainable businesses' capabilities. In this direction, this article outlined true business sustainability's capabilities needed to fuel cultured meat enterprises and opened fruitful research avenues on the implications of cultured meat for sustainable development.
