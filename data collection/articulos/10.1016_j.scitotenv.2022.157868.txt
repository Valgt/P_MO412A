                  Ecosystem services (ES) are the important component supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) realization. In recent decades, rapid urbanization has strongly affected the relationship between ES and SDGs, resulting in the decoupling of ES and SDGs. However, the key urbanization factors dominating the relationship between ES and SDGs are still unclear. In this study, a structural equation model was constructed to explore the impact path and its change of urbanization structure and scale factors on the relationship between ES and SDGs. The results showed that the economic urbanization structure indicator (Engel coefficient) under the influence of technology import significantly impacted the relationship between ES and SDGs in different periods. Under the influence of changes in urban and rural population, population urbanization structure indicator (labor force population proportion) had significant impact on the relationship between ES and economic SDGs, which was significantly stronger in the period of 2010–2015 than in the period of 2000–2005. Land urbanization scale indicators (construction land proportion, and protected natural area proportion) also significantly impacted the relationship between ES and SDGs. Especially for ecological SDGs, the negative impact of construction land on protected natural area increased significantly in the period of 2010–2015, which might further weaken the ES's contribution to SDGs. This study highlighted that along with the continuous transformation of China's society, the key impacts on the relationship between ES and SDGs resulted from the urbanization indicators of scale as well as structure, which provided an extensive support for the sustainable development and social transformation of developing countries and regions.

Editor: Deyi Hou Ecosystem services (ES) are the important component supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) realization. In recent decades, rapid urbanization has strongly affected the relationship between ES and SDGs, resulting in the decoupling of ES and SDGs. However, the key urbanization factors dominating the relationship between ES and SDGs are still unclear. In this study, a structural equation model was constructed to explore the impact path and its change of urbanization structure and scale factors on the relationship between ES and SDGs. The results showed that the economic urbanization structure indicator (Engel coefficient) under the influence of technology import significantly impacted the relationship between ES and SDGs in different periods. Under the influence of changes in urban and rural population, population urbanization structure indicator (labor force population proportion) had significant impact on the relationship between ES and economic SDGs, which was significantly stronger in the period of 2010–2015 than in the period of 2000–2005. Land urbanization scale indicators (construction land proportion, and protected natural area proportion) also significantly impacted the relationship between ES and SDGs. Especially for ecological SDGs, the negative impact of construction land on protected natural area increased significantly in the period of 2010–2015, which might further weaken the ES's contribution to SDGs. This study highlighted that along with the continuous transformation of China's society, the key impacts on the relationship between ES and SDGs resulted from the urbanization indicators of scale as well as structure, which provided an extensive support for the sustainable development and social transformation of developing countries and regions.

In this context, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted and officially launched in 2016, strive to provide sustainable benefits for present and future generations from three aspects: society, economy, and environment (UN, 2015 ). In order to achieve the goals, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the International Council for Science (ICSU) have concluded that ecosystem is the basis for the implementation of SDGs, and that ecosystem services (ES) connect the ecosystem and SDGs (IPBES, 2016 ; ICSU, 2015 ). The Nature-based Solutions (NbS) proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) also emphasized that the significance of ES promoted sustainable development (IUCN, 2020 ). The ES’s contribution to SDGs has been widely discussed. For example, Wood et al. (2018)  conducted an online survey of scholars engaged in ES research field, and the results showed that ES can create important contributions to the realization of 41 sub-goals among 12 SDGs. Yang et al. (2020)  found through investigation that SDG15, SDG13, SDG14 and SDG6 were closely related to ES such as climate regulation, water supply, food supply, water purification and landscape recreation at global scale. The important contribution of ES provided by specific ecosystems such as oceans, woodlands, wetlands, soils, and reservoirs to various SDGs has also been widely recognized (Ward et al., 2018 ; Hazarika and Jandl, 2019 ; Smith et al., 2019 ; Keesstra et al., 2018 ; Guo et al., 2021 ). However, through integrating some published studies, it was found that the ES high-value area was significantly inconsistent with the SDGs score high-value area (Xie et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Reyers and Selig (2020)  also showed that the complex relationship between ES and SDGs had not been paid enough attention, which lead to a non-negligible threat to the realization of SDGs on schedule. In order to effectively incorporate the ES's contribution into the realization mechanism of SDGs, it is crucial to reveal the key factors affecting the relationship between ES and SDGs. Urbanization has been globally recognized as a key driving force of SDGs realization (Lu et al., 2019 ; Liu et al., 2020 ), mainly including land urbanization, economic urbanization, and population urbanization. The global investment in infrastructure construction driven by urbanization is $2.3 trillion per year (Thacker et al., 2019 ), and is expected to be more in the future. It has been estimated that global investment for newly established and updated infrastructure will reach $94 trillion by 2040 (Global Infrastructure Hub, 2017 ). As one of the biggest developing countries, China has been experiencing rapid urbanization under the background of social transformation over the past 40 years, which has led to the increasing of urban population proportion from 19.4% in 1980 to 60.6% in 2019. Furthermore, with the rapid growth of GDP, China has become an influential economy in the world (Lu et al., 2019 ). Urbanization has advanced China's sustainable development capacity in terms of poverty reduction (SDGs 1,2), safety and health (SDG 3), and employment and economic growth (SDGs 8) (Lu et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). However, urbanization has led to a number of significant environmental issues (Peng et al., 2020 ; Huang et al., 2019 ), especially the deterioration in water quality and air quality (Xu et al., 2022 ; Bai et al., 2014 ). The expansion of construction land has also encroached on the natural ecosystem and led to fragmented natural ecosystem, and thus ES degradation and loss (Felipe-Lucia et al., 2020 ; Peng et al., 2017 ). In addition, the continuing population growth has intensified the pressure on the consumption of natural resources. Therefore, the substantial increase in urbanization scale across China has had a profound impact on ES and SDGs. With the development of urbanization on a large scale, China's social transformation has reached a critical period, and new concerns have been raised for the sustainable and high-quality development of society. The new round of China's national planning released in October 2020 revealed that urbanization structure transformation has gradually replaced scale transformation to be the key point of China's social transformation. From the perspective of economic transformation, in China's new development stage, it is necessary to pay attention to not only economic growth goals, but also residents' income/consumption structure. From the perspective of population transformation, China has made coping with population aging a national strategy. From the perspective of land transformation, China is aiming to build a new pattern of high-standard territorial space development, alleviating land use conflicts accompanied by the contradiction between development and protection (Communique of the fifth Plenary Meeting of the 19th CPC Central Committee, 2020 ). The urbanization-induced structural transformation has had an important impact on ES and SDGs. For example, from the perspective of economic structure, the China Consumer Survey Report 2020 showed that the Chinese economy was gradually shifting from an investment-led model to a consumption-led model (China Consumer Survey report, 2020 ), and a change in consumption structure might become the driver leading the sustainable development of the urban economy (SDGs 8,9,11 & 12). From the perspective of population structure, the population structural transformation caused by population immigration has led to a change in rural livelihoods, which further affected farmers' well-being (SDGs 1, 2 & 3) and the intensity of ES consumption (Yang et al., 2018 ; Zheng et al., 2013 ). From the perspective of land structure, Ma and Wen (2021)  showed that in the context of rapid urbanization, optimizing land use structure can help achieve a win-win situation in economic benefits (SDG 8) and ES values. To sum up, the impact of the transformation of urbanization scale and structure on ES and SDGs has gradually become the focus of government and scholars. In order to understand the complex relationship between ES and SDGs, and to enhance the ES's contribution to SDGs, it is crucial to further analyze the impact of urbanization on the relationship between ES and SDGs. Based on the above context, the following three questions are raised in this study: Firstly, what are the main factor affecting the relationship between ES and SDGs, i.e., is it the scale factors or structure factors of urbanization? Secondly, what is the impact path of urbanization factors on the relationship between ES and SDGs? Thirdly, what is the change trend for the impact of urbanization factors on the relationship between ES and SDGs, i.e., is it strengthening or weakening? In order to answer the above questions, the relationships between ES and ecological SDGs (including SDGs 6, 13, 14 & 15)/economic SDGs (including SDGs 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11 & 12) in China from 2000 to 2015 (See Table S1 for a list and description of SDGs) and their change trends were explored in this study. Through integrating the complex relationships among ES, SDGs, and urbanization factors, the impact path and intensity of multiple types of urbanization factors (scale & structure) on the relationships between ES and ecological SDGs/economic SDGs were further investigated using structural equation model (SEM).  2 Methods 2.1 Framework Based on spatial perspective, it was aimed to explore the response of the relationship between ES and SDGs to urbanization in this study (Fig. 1  ). Firstly, with the application of various SDGs indicators, spatio-temporal changes of ecological SDGs and economic SDGs in China from 2000 to 2015 was characterized using the method of equal weighted addition and averaging. Based on biophysical models (such as InVEST model, and RULSE model), the spatio-temporal changes of four types of ES in China from 2000 to 2015 were mapped. Secondly, the ES-SDGs coordination coefficient was calculated for ecological SDGs and economic SDGs respectively, thereby revealing the spatio-temporal changes in the relationship between ES and SDGs in China from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, the structural equation model was used to explore the impact intensity and path of eight urbanization indicators on the relationship between ES and SDGs. Finally, the data during 2000–2005 and 2010–2015 were respectively integrated to explore the change of impact intensity and path of urbanization indicators on the relationship between ES and SDGs in different study periods.  2.2 Study area and data sources This study took 31 provinces in China mainland as the research object. China's land area is about 9.6 million km2 , ranking the third in the world. The terrain of China is high in the west and low in the east, and the topography is complex and diverse. The eastern region of China is dominated by plains and low mountains and hills, while the central and western regions are dominated by plateaus, basins and mountains. Based on topography and land-sea distribution, China has significant spatial differences in climate. For example, in terms of precipitation, the annual precipitation in China has a decreasing trend from the southeast coast to the northwest inland. China has experienced a rapid urbanization process. The process of urbanization has promoted socio-economic development and improved the living conditions of residents. Since 2010, China's total GDP has ranked the second in the world. In 2020, China's total GDP has reached 101.6 trillion yuan. However, the rapid urbanization process affected the environment directly or indirectly, resulting in a series of ecological problems such as habitat loss and soil erosion etc., and the contradiction between human and environment was becoming more and more serious. Therefore, urbanization partly exacerbated ecological unsustainability while creating material wealth in China. It is important to explore the impact of complex urbanization factors on ES and sustainable development. The methods used in this study included ES spatial mapping, SDGs spatial mapping, ES-SDGs coordination coefficient calculations, and structural equation modeling. The basic data used in this study included land use data, elevation data, soil data, vegetation data, meteorological data, and various socio-economic data. The data sources are shown in Table 1  .  2.3 ES spatial mapping ES plays an important role in the sustainable development of social-ecological systems and the realization of SDGs (Xu and Peng, 2022 ). In order to comprehensively characterize the overall quality and spatial distribution of ES in China, the basic factors that maintain and support ecosystem operation were considered, and four kinds of ecosystem services were selected, i.e. water yield, soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and habitat maintenance. 2.3.1 Water yield The InVEST model has been widely used in the calculation of water yield due to its convenient operation and high parameter availability. The water yield of ecosystems was evaluated using the water yield module in the InVEST model, which has been applied over a long period in China (Pei et al., 2019 ; Peng et al., 2019 ). Its basic principle is to estimate water yield by subtracting actual evapotranspiration from precipitation, which is a calculation method based on the water balance (Zhang et al., 2004 ). The core formula is presented in the Supplementary materials (Eqs. S1–S4).  2.3.2 Soil conservation The soil conservation can be calculated from the difference between potential soil erosion and actual soil erosion (Willemen et al., 2019 ; Ouyang et al., 2016 ). The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) was used to evaluate soil conservation considering the data availability associated with various parameters and the universality of its application. The core formula is presented in the Supplementary materials (Eqs. S5–S10).  2.3.3 Carbon sequestration Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing, collecting, and sequestering carbon into carbon pools. Net primary productivity (NPP) is a key link in the carbon feedback between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere (Liu et al., 2018 ), which can effectively characterize the ability of vegetation to absorb carbon and fix it into organic matter (Collalti et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the carbon sequestration service in this study was represented by net primary productivity (NPP). Because there was a lack of NPP products in 2015, the NPP products in 2014 were used as substitutes in this study.  2.3.4 Habitat maintenance Habitat maintenance refers to the ability of an ecosystem to provide suitable living conditions for individuals and populations based on the availability of living resources. The InVEST model has been widely used to measure habitat maintenance due to its convenient operation and high parameter availability. Therefore, the Habitat Quality module in the InVEST model was used in this study. The model firstly determined the type of land use belonging to the habitat or threat source, and then evaluated its impact on habitat quality in combination with the habitat threat density data (Sallustio et al., 2017 ). The core formula is presented in the Supplementary materials (Eqs. S11–S12).   2.4 SDGs spatial mapping The United Nations has proposed 17 SDGs that aim to put the world on a sustainable and resilient path (Wu et al., 2022 ). The main goals are to free humanity from poverty, to heal and protect the planet, and to strengthen peace and freedom in the world. The SDGs take into account the three aspects of sustainable development: economy, society, and environment (UN, 2015 ; Lu et al., 2015 ). Combining the connotations of the 17 types of SDGs and the social-ecological background of SDGs realization in China (Lu et al., 2018 ), SDGs were divided into three categories: ecological SDGs, economic SDGs, and social SDGs. The SDGs directly related to climate, water, and biodiversity were classified as ecological SDGs, including SDG6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG13 (Climate action), SDG14 (Life below water), and SDG15 (Life on land). The SDGs directly related to economic development, consumption, and infrastructure construction were classified as economic SDGs, including SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), SDG11 (Sustainable cities and communities), and SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production). Since the relationship between social SDGs and ES is still unclear (Wood et al., 2018 ), only economic SDGs and ecological SDGs were explored in this study. The SDGs spatial database used in this study were the provincial-level normalized data of the scores of 17 SDGs in China in 2000/2005/2010/2015 (Xu et al., 2020 ). It is difficult to measure the difference in the importance of various SDGs to China's sustainable development. Therefore, it is believed that various SDGs are equally important. The calculation of ecological SDGs and economic SDGs adopted equal weight addition and the average processing method. The core formula is as follows:(1) SDG ecol  = ∑ i = 1  n  SDG ecol _ i   / n 1     (2) SDG econ  = ∑ i = 1  n  SDG econ _ i   / n 2     where, SDG ecol   is the ecological SDGs, SDG ecol _i   is ith ecological SDG, and n 1  is the number of ecological SDGs. SDG econ   is the economic SDGs, SDG econ _i   is the ith economic SDGs, and n 2  is the number of economic SDGs.  2.5 ES-SDGs coordination coefficient calculation In previous studies, the direct or indirect contribution made by ES to SDGs has been recognized (Reyers and Selig, 2020 ; DasGupta et al., 2019 ), but the way to quantify the relationship between ES and SDGs is still in the exploratory stage. In this study, the ES-SDGs coordination coefficient was used to evaluate the spatio-temporal variations in the matching characteristics of ES and SDGs in China. The coordination coefficient is a relative value that can be used to compare the relative development levels of ES and SDGs with different samples in different periods. The development level of the sample ES/SDGs can be judged by comparing the values and their mean of the sample ES/SDGs. When the coordination coefficient was >1, the relative development level for ES was higher than that for the SDGs. When the coordination coefficient was <1, the relative development level for ES was lower than that for the SDGs. The overall ES was obtained by normalizing the above four ES with equal weight. The formula is as follows:(3) ES i  = ∑ j = 1  4  ES ij  / n    (4) C ES & SDGs   = ES i  / ES ¯   SDG i _ ecol / econ   / SDG ecol / econ   ¯        where, C ES&SDGs   is the ES-SDGs coordination coefficient; n  is the number of ES; ES i   is the average value of the four types of ES for the i-th sample; ES ij   is the normalized value of the j-th ES for the i-th sample; ES ¯    is the average for all samples; SDG i_ecol/econ   is the ecological or economic SDGs for the i-th sample; and SDG ecol / econ   ¯    is the average value of ecological SDGs or economic SDGs for all samples.  2.6 Urbanization impact path analysis Urbanization has a clear promotion effect on SDGs (Lu et al., 2019 ) and is probably the dominant factor causing the changes in the ES-SDGs relationship. Urbanization is a complex process, and in different research fields there are different understandings of urbanization. In the field of economics, urbanization can be understood as the transformation of economic models and production technologies (Zheng and Walsh, 2019 ). In the field of geography, urbanization can be characterized as the transformation from ecological land to construction land (Wang and Zhang, 2022 ). In the field of demography, urbanization can be represented as the transformation in the composition of urban and rural population (Hong et al., 2021 ). Integrating understandings of urbanization in different fields, the urbanization indicators were divided into four categories, which were economic development (GDP per area, and Engel coefficient), population characteristics (urban and rural population ratio, and labor force population proportion), land use (construction land proportion, and protected natural area proportion), and technological level (technology import, and technology output) (for specific information see Table S2). Meanwhile, urbanization indicators were also divided into two types, i.e. structure indicators (Engel coefficient, labor force population proportion, urban and rural population ratio) and scale indicators (GDP per area, construction land proportion, protected natural area proportion, technology import, and technology output). The indicators selected in this study were all measurable variables and did not duplicate those used in the SDGs evaluation. It should be noted that in this study the population density indicator was not selected, which was commonly used in a large number of related studies. There was an attempt to include the population density indicator during the model construction process. However, its correlations with ES-ecological SDGs coordination coefficients (ELSC) or ES-economic SDGs coordination coefficients (ENSC), were both non-significant. As a result, the population density indicator was not considered. A structural equation model (SEM) was further used to explore the urbanization indicators' impact paths and change trends on the relationship between ES and SDGs. The model included urbanization indicators and ELSC/ENSC. The sample size was 124 from 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China from 2000 to 2015. Since the 1980s, SEM analysis has attracted wide attentions because it can solve the traditional problems of multi-cause and multi-effect relationships, and the non-directly observable variables in social science and economic management (Wu et al., 2021 ; Jiang et al., 2020 ). SEM usually consists of a measurement model and a structural model. If only the structural component in the structural equation model is present, that is, only the measured variables are considered, it is called a path analysis. A path analysis includes multiple regression equations, which means that it can analyze the relationships between multiple variables in the system at the same time and can deal with more complex variable relationships. The core formula is as follows:(5) η = Bη + Γξ + ζ    where, ξ  is the exogenous variable; η  is the endogenous variable; B  represents the relationship between endogenous variables; Γ  represents the impact of exogenous variables on endogenous variables; and ζ  is the residual term of the structural equation.  2.7 Hypotheses underlying the model Based on relevant research results (Thacker et al., 2019 ; Yang, 2013 ; Seto et al., 2017 ), it was hypothesized that the interrelationships among various urbanization factors construct different paths of impacts on ELSC/ENSC (Table 2  ). From the perspective of economic development, the GDP per area represented the financial strength of the regional government. The Engel coefficient characterized the income level of residents, whose change indicated the residents' consumption structure transformation. With the support of existing research (Cumming and Cramon-Taubadel, 2018 ), it was assumed that the improvement in the economic level of the government and residents had a positive impact on SDGs and put pressure on ES, thus leading to a decrease in ELSC/ENSC. It was also assumed that government financial strength had a positive impact on income. From the perspective of land use, the construction land proportion measured the scale of regional development, and the protected natural area proportion represented the ability of a region to protect wildlife habitats. It was shown that increases in land development intensity would damage ES (Pan, 2012 ). Therefore, it was assumed that an increase in the construction land proportion would lead to a decrease in ELSC/ENSC. It was also assumed that the construction land proportion had a negative impact on the protected natural area proportion and a positive impact on the GDP per area. Construction land expansion led by human activities is likely to conflict with the construction of natural protected areas (Leclère et al., 2020 ), and local development and infrastructure construction will directly lead to GDP increase. The increase in the protected natural area proportion contributes to improvements in biodiversity (Cazalis et al., 2020 ; Maxwell et al., 2020 ). Therefore, it was hypothesized that an increase in the protected natural area proportion had a positive effect on ELSC. From the perspective of population characteristics, the urban and rural population ratio and labor force population proportion jointly show the population vitality of the region. It was assumed that the increase in the labor force population proportion would directly promote economic SDGs, GDP per area, and income, thus decreasing ENSC. The increase in the proportion of young and middle-aged people directly contributes to economic creativity (Harper, 2014 ). It was assumed that an increase in the urban and rural population ratio would lead to an increase in the construction land proportion, an increase in the labor force population proportion, and an increase in GDP per area. Based on the current situation in China, it was also assumed that construction land would continue to increase to meet the living demands of the urban population, the urban population would continue to be mainly young and middle-aged, and the labor force structure and GDP productivity would also change. From the perspective of technology level, the technology import and technology output levels show the regional scientific and technological ability from two dimensions. Some studies have suggested that higher levels of science and technology are conducive to improving human well-being (Xu et al., 2019b ). Therefore, it was hypothesized that both could lead to SDGs improvement, resulting in a decrease in ELSC/ENSC. Furthermore, technology could help increase the efficiency of economic production and improve residents' living quality. Thus, it was also hypothesized that technology level had a positive effect on GDP per area and resident income. In summary, the urbanization impact path models for ELSC and ENSC showed some differences. Compared to ENSC, ELSC did not have a direct impact path on labor force population proportion; whereas ENSC did not have a direct impact path on the protected natural area proportion (Figs. S1, S2). Furthermore, six validation indicators were used to test the accuracy of the hypothetical path. The scores of these indexes were effective proof that the data supported the hypothetical path (Tables S3, S5, S7, S9, S11, & S13). Based on these results, the path coefficient and significance (Tables S4, S6, S8, S10, S12, & S14), were compared to the observed data to identify indicators that had a significant impact on the ES-SDGs coordination coefficient.   3 Results 3.1 Spatio-temporal change of ES-SDGs relationships From the perspective of spatial pattern, the ELSC showed a pattern of high in the south and low in the north (Fig. 2  ). The four highest ELSC provinces were all located in the south, with an average coordination coefficient of 1.392. The lowest four provinces were all located in the north where the average coordination coefficient was only 0.346. The ENSC also showed the same pattern (Fig. 2 ). The four provinces with the highest ENSC were also located in the south, with an average coordination coefficient of 1.448, whereas the lowest four provinces, except Shanghai, were all located in the north, with an average coordination coefficient of 0.269. The strong spatial heterogeneity between ES and SDGs was the dominant reason for their coordination pattern. From the perspective of temporal change, the overall pattern for ELSC showed no significant change in 2000, 2005, and 2010, mainly because ES remained stable and the ecological SDGs only showed a minor increase. In 2015, the ELSC significantly decreased, which resulted from a remarkable increase in the ecological SDGs (compared to 2010, ES decreased by 1.91% and ecological SDGs increased by 8.75%) (Fig. S3). The ENSC showed no significant change in 2000 and 2005, but significantly decreased in 2010 and 2015. This was mainly caused by the continuous growth of economic related SDGs, especially after 2005 when the increase in economic indicators was significantly higher than that for ES (The ES had increased by 3.33% and economic SDGs had increased by 19.1% in 2015 compared to 2005) (Fig. S3).  3.2 Urbanization impact path on ES-SDGs relationship The two models revealed similar pathways. The impact of urbanization factors on ELSC and ENSC was mainly implemented through two paths. Firstly, the technological and economic development path results showed that ELSC and ENSC were not directly affected by technology import and output (Figs. 3 and 4   ). Among them, technology import had a significantly negative impact on the Engel coefficient (p  ≤ 0.05), with the same impact coefficient of −0.278, which indirectly affected ELSC and ENSC. It was worth noted that the impact of GDP per area, which had been generally used to characterize economic urbanization in previous studies, on ELSC and ENSC was not significant (p  > 0.05). The Engel coefficient had a highly significant impact on ELSC and ENSC (p  ≤ 0.01), with the impact coefficient of 0.435 and 0.434, respectively. It showed that the consumption structure transformation brought by the improvement in resident income levels could promote the decoupling of ES and SDGs. Secondly, the population and land use path results showed that the urban population structure indirectly affected ELSC and ENSC, through a highly significant impact on the construction land proportion (impact coefficient = 0.771). At the same time, the construction land proportion also had a negatively significant impact on ELSC and ENSC, with the impact coefficients of −0.455 and −0.446, respectively, which was consistent with the model hypothesis of H4 in this study. The unique paths in each model also showed significant impact on ELSC or ENSC. For the ELSC model, the protected natural area proportion had a significantly negative impact on the ELSC (p  ≤ 0.01), with the impact coefficient of −0.352 (Fig. 3 ), which was contrary to the hypothesis H7 in this study. At the same time, it was shown that the construction land proportion had a significantly negative impact on the protected natural area proportion (impact coefficient = −0.189, p  ≤ 0.05), indicating that there was spatial conflict between the two land use types. For the ENSC model, it was found that labor force population proportion had a significantly negative impact on ENSC (p  ≤ 0.05), with the impact coefficient of −0.165 (Fig. 4 ). The reason might be that rural-urban population migration led to an improvement in labor capacity (the urban-rural population ratio had a highly and significantly positive impact on labor force population proportion, with the impact coefficient of 0.476), which promoted the growth of economic SDGs.  3.3 Change of urbanization impact path on ES-SDGs relationship The temporal change trend for ELSC/ENSC showed that there had been a decreasing trend between 2000–2005 and 2010–2015 (Fig. 2 ). Therefore, a specific SEM was constructed to explore the impact path change of urbanization on ENSC and ELSC over two separate periods (2000–2005 and 2010–2015). Due to the data limitations of the model (the data of 2000–2005 and 2010–2015 were input into the two models, respectively, with a sample size of 62), only variables with significant impacts on ENSC and ELSC were selected when constructing the model. For ELSC, comparing the two periods of 2000–2005 and 2010–2015, there were both the same influence path and different influence paths (Fig. 5  ). For the same influence path, technology import had significantly negative impact on Engel coefficient (impact coefficient of −0.246 and −0.254, respectively), and then Engel coefficient had a highly and significantly positive impact on ELSC (impact coefficient of 0.423 and 0.413, respectively). Urban-rural population ratio had a highly and significantly positive impact on protected natural area proportion (impact coefficient of 0.721 and 0.811, respectively), and protected natural area proportion had a highly and significantly negative impact on ELSC (impact coefficient of −0.272 and −0.449, respectively). For different impact paths, protected natural area proportion had non-significant impact on construction land proportion during 2000–2005. However, during 2010–2015, protected natural area proportion had a highly significant negative impact on construction land proportion, and construction land had a significantly negative impact on ELSC (impact coefficient of −0.320). For ENSC, comparing the two periods of 2000–2005 and 2010–2015, there were also both the same influence path and different influence paths (Fig. 6  ). For the same influence path, technology import had significantly negative impact on Engel coefficient, which had a highly and significantly positive impact on ENSC (impact coefficient of 0.414 and 0.507, respectively). Urban-rural population ratio had a highly and significantly positive impact on construction land proportion, which had a highly and significantly negative impact on ENSC (impact coefficient of −0.413 and −0.275, respectively). For different influence paths, labor force population proportion had non-significant impact on ENSC during 2000–2005. However, during 2010–2015, labor force population proportion had a significantly negative impact on ENSC (impact coefficient of −0.206).   4 Discussion 4.1 Urbanization impact factor and path Driven by the urban-rural population ratio, population urbanization structure indicator affected ENSC. Although the change in total population continued to slow down, as a result of the rapid increase in the proportion of the urban population, the proportion of the aging population had grown rapidly and was still in the acceleration period (Fig. S4c, d). Along with the seventh national census registration, it is widely acknowledged that China is currently facing strong challenges brought about by population structure changes. From 1980 to 2010, the number of labor migrants in China increased from 2 million to 150 million (Rush, 2011 ). Furthermore, the young and middle-aged labor force showed stronger economic creativity (Harper, 2014 ). Such large-scale labor migrations were bound to exert a strong impact on the economic SDGs. The impact of the Engel coefficient (representing resident income level) on ENSC and ELSC was greater than that of GDP per area. Along the key economic factor change from “national wealth” to “individual wealth”, the residents' consumption structure also significantly changed from meeting the basic demands for food and to achieving more diversified consumption objectives, which should lead to a diverse and sustainable economy. However, the acceleration in labor migration would lead to inequality in terms of resident income and imbalanced regional development (Lu et al., 2019 ; Hvistendahl, 2014 ), which might further aggravate the impact of the residents' economic structure on SDGs achievement. In terms of technology, compared with technology output, technology import could improve residents' life quality more pertinently and had a more significant impact on the Engel coefficient. Land urbanization scale had a significant impact on the ENSC or ELSC because there had been a substantial expansion of construction land in order to meet the living demands of the increased urban population. However, construction land had encroached on the natural ecosystem, and the increase in land use intensity had threatened ecosystem quality. Both these changes have had a direct impact on ES. These results were consistent with findings reported by previous studies (Felipe-Lucia et al., 2020 ; Bryan et al., 2018 ; Huang et al., 2020 ). It was accepted that an increase in the proportion of protected natural areas would lead to a decrease in ELSC, which might be due to the rapid and significant improvement of biodiversity compared to natural vegetation. However, in this study it was found that the protected natural area proportion had a positive impact on ELSC when it exceeded 20 % (Fig. S4b), which might be due to the scale effect of ES restoration. The ecological significance of large-scale ES restoration was stronger, compared with small-scale one (Garibaldi et al., 2020 ; Ma et al., 2014 ).  4.2 Change trends of urbanization impact The impact of the Engel coefficient on ELSC and ENSC was highly significant during the two periods (p  ≤ 0.01) (Figs. 5 and 6 ). Both ELSC and ENSC showed a linear and rapid increase (Fig. S5a, S6a) as the Engel coefficient increased, which showed that the residents’ income (consumption structure) had a long-term and stable impact on the relationship between ES and SDGs. In different periods, the impact of labor level on ENSC behaved different degrees of significance. During 2000–2005, the labor force impact on ENSC was not significant, whereas it was highly and significantly negative (p  ≤ 0.05) during 2010–2015 (Fig. 6 ). It was further revealed that the rate of change for ENSC gradually increased along with the increase in labor force population proportion (Fig. S6c). This result indicated that social transformation led to a change in labor force population proportion, which had a gradually increasing impact on the relationship between ES and SDGs. Labor force flow between regions will produce an obvious cluster effect. The region with a high labor force has a high level of social development, thus attracting larger labor forces. As a result, the urban-rural labor force structure in China had become increasingly unbalanced (Yang, 2013 ). The population structure analysis of the major Chinese labor-inflow provinces and labor-outflow provinces showed that, the increase in both urban and rural populations in the major labor-inflow provinces was more significant than in the major labor-outflow provinces, while the increase in aging across the major labor-outflow provinces was more severe than across inflow provinces (Fig. S4e, f). The construction land proportion had a highly significant impact on ENSC and ELSC (Figs. 5 & 6 ), but the degree of impact decreased over time (Fig. S5b, S6b). In terms of ELSC, the impact of protected natural area proportion on construction land proportion increased, i.e. from non-significance to significantly negative correlation (Fig. 5 ), which reflected the intensified conflict among human and natural land use types. The analysis of the temporal changes in construction land and protected natural areas in China showed that the rapid area increasing in both land use types had reached a stable level around 2005 (Fig. S4b). When the total area was fixed, the trade-off between the two land use types became more significant, although there were other land use types. An excess expansion in construction land would limit the development of protected natural areas, as reported by other studies (Lu et al., 2020 ). In summary, within the context of urbanization development transformation, the impact of economic urbanization structure indicator on the relationship between ES and SDGs was stable. During 2000–2015, the impact of the population urbanization structure indicator on the relationship between ES and SDGs had intensified. The impact of land urbanization scale indicator had slightly changed, while the structural conflict increased over the whole study period.  4.3 High-quality development oriented social transformation In the context of China's social transformation, the relationship between ES and SDGs was not only affected by urbanization scale factors, but also by urbanization structure factors (Fig. 7  ). It is worth thinking about improving the quality of sustainable development based on the integration of urbanization structure and scale transformation. It is acknowledged that economic motivation plays an important role in achieving the SDGs (Wood et al., 2018 ). At present, the increase in residents' income levels and the transformation of consumption structure in China are conducive to the promotion of SDGs. Furthermore, the willingness to pay for ecosystem services will increase as the number of residents entering the middle-level and high-level income rises (Shao et al., 2018 ). Therefore, in the context of the boom economy, the development trend for the residents' economic structure had positive effects and should be maintained. From the perspective of population characteristics, China's aging trend is still obvious, and the cross-regional flow of urban and rural population has also exacerbated the aging problem in some regions. This population structure transformation has had a negative impact on the progress towards SDGs and the promotion of ES. The younger generation has a stronger aspiration for ecosystem conservation and restoration compared to the elderly (Dardanoni and Guerriero, 2021 ). Therefore, measures need to be taken to suppress the aging trend and it is more urgent to propose adaptive strategies. The Chinese government has made efforts in relieving aging. For example, the Population and Family Planning Law, promulgated in January 2016, began to encourage couples to have two children, in contrast to the one-child policy in the past. In addition, limited land resources have led to increased conflicts between construction land and protected natural area. However, it is difficult to reduce the proportion of construction land during the process of urbanization, especially at national scale. Furthermore, China's protected natural area system is still imperfect (Xu et al., 2019a ). Therefore, it is necessary to improve the level of intensive land use and improve the utilization efficiency of underused or unused land, which should promote large-scale natural habitats transformation, thus improving ES and ensuring the continuous progress towards ecological SDGs. Under the existing SDGs evaluation system, the gradual decrease of the ES-SDGs coordination coefficient indicated that the growth rate of SDGs was higher than that of ES. The results showed that the diversification of consumption structure and the improvement of labor level could greatly promote the progress towards SDGs. However, this SDGs realization approach would lead to the underestimation of the ES's contribution to SDGs. The intensification of land use structure contradictions could also pose further threats to ES. From long-term sustainability perspective, if the growth of social development is so large which exceeds the capacity of the ecosystem, ecological degradation will appear and then lead to social and economic collapse (Cumming and Cramon-Taubadel, 2018 ). The ES’s contribution to SDGs is fundamental and long-term, such as material resources (water resources, food, bioenergy, etc.) (Pascual et al., 2017 ), ecological regulation (soil conservation, water purification, carbon sequestration, etc.) (Zheng et al., 2019 ), cultural values (outdoor recreation, natural knowledge, etc.) (Freeman et al., 2017 ), and human health (mental health, inspiration, etc.) (Remme et al., 2021 ). Therefore, policymakers should consider the demands of SDGs realization more comprehensively. In addition to socio-economic development, the long-term sustainable ES provision is also crucial to achieving the SDGs. When implementing sustainable management decisions, measures related to the three dimensions of society, economy and environment should be more effectively balanced.  4.4 Limitations and future research directions The impact of urbanization on the relationships between ES and SDGs was quantified in this study within the context of China's social transformation The SDGs cover three dimensions, i.e. economic, social, and ecological dimensions. In order to explore the response of the spatial difference between ES and economic dimension/ecological dimension of SDGs to urbanization, in this study economic SDGs and ecological SDGs were defined. It is undeniable that each type of SDGs is highly generalized and contains diverse information. Therefore, combining different SDGs in this study would increase the uncertainty of the results. At the same time, in the SDGs calculation, setting the various SDGs to equal weights increased the subjectivity of the results. In terms of ES calculation methods, NPP was selected to represent carbon sequestration services. However, the carbon sequestration pathway of wetland ecosystem is complex, which can increase atmospheric carbon emissions by emitting methane and weaken the carbon sequestration effect based on NPP. Thus, using NPP to represent carbon sequestration added to the uncertainty of the results. Moreover, some representative factors were selected to character urbanization process, such as population, economy, land use and technology. However, the process of urbanization covers numerous complex social-economic-ecological processes. In this study we preliminarily explored the impact of urbanization scale and structure on the relationship between ES and SDGs, and proposed potential pathways of joint impact of urbanization structure and scale. On this basis, the complex impact of urbanization on ES and SDGs still needs to be further analyzed. In addition, the period of this study is from 2000 to 2015, which is due to the limitation of the SDGs dataset used in this study.   5 Conclusions The relationships among ES, SDGs and urbanization are close and hierarchical. In the context of rapid urbanization in China, the spatial relationship between ES and SDGs was strongly influenced by the transformation of urbanization structure and scale. In this study, we explored the spatio-temporal changes of provincial ecological SDGs, economic SDGs, and ES in China from 2000 to 2015, and constructed the ES-SDGs coordination coefficient to represent the spatial relationship between ES and SDGs. Furthermore, eight types of urbanization scale and structure indicators were considered, and structural equation model was used to explore the key urbanization factors and impact paths on the relationship between ES and SDGs, with a contrast between two periods (2000–2005 and 2010–2015). The results showed that both urbanization structure and scale indicators significantly impacted the relationship between ES and SDGs. Among them, economic urbanization structure indicator had a significant impact on ELSC and ENSC. Population urbanization structure indicators had stronger impact on ENSC. Land urbanization scale indicators had a significant impact on ENSC and ELSC, and the land use structure conflict might pose a potential threat to ELSC. Therefore, the impact of urbanization on sustainable development needs to be considered more comprehensively. From the perspective of urbanization development transformation, the key factors that impact the relationship between ES and SDGs had been identified, which laid a solid foundation for the analysis of the internal relationship between ES and SDGs. Future research should further explore how to reveal the long-term impact of ES on SDGs in terms of urbanization structure transformation, and how to develop the coupling of ES and urbanization to SDGs, so as to help enrich the assessment and management of SDGs from the perspective of ES, and to promote the realization of high-quality development goals in China.
