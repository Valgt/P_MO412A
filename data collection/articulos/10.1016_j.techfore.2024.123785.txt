                  This study investigates the relationship between technological innovations, financial development, and income inequality implications on achieving Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG10) in seven Asian economies via testing the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of technological innovation on income inequality in the concept of technological Kuznets curve hypothesis. The significant contribution of this study is introducing the Technological Kuznets Curve (TKC) as an extension to the Kuznets curve (KC) framework to capture the impact of technological innovation on income inequality. The PMG/ARDL was applied to estimate the coefficients to accomplish the study's objective. The panel cointegration tests confirm that all variables are cointegrated with income inequality. The empirical findings validate the KC hypothesis and demonstrate that technological innovations contribute to reducing income inequality within the Kuznets curve framework in the long run. Financial development (money supply) was negatively correlated with income inequality. The study further validates the TKC hypothesis, revealing an inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality. Financial development, measured by domestic credit to the private sector, also shows a negative correlation with income inequality within the TKC framework. However, the money supply demonstrates a positive link with income inequality. The study recommended the necessity to prioritize policies that support technological innovation through subsidies, encouragement for research and development, and collaborations between the public and private sectors will greatly lower income inequality and support achieving Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG10). Financial development significantly facilitates access to financial services and contributes to diminishing income inequality by building an effective and inclusive banking system (mobile banking services for poor communities), easing access to credit for emerging and small and midsize enterprises (SMEs), and money circulation. Governments should strategically allocate resources toward programs and initiatives that directly address income inequality and promote inclusive growth.

This study investigates the relationship between technological innovations, financial development, and income inequality implications on achieving Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG10) in seven Asian economies via testing the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of technological innovation on income inequality in the concept of technological Kuznets curve hypothesis. The significant contribution of this study is introducing the Technological Kuznets Curve (TKC) as an extension to the Kuznets curve (KC) framework to capture the impact of technological innovation on income inequality. The PMG/ARDL was applied to estimate the coefficients to accomplish the study's objective. The panel cointegration tests confirm that all variables are cointegrated with income inequality. The empirical findings validate the KC hypothesis and demonstrate that technological innovations contribute to reducing income inequality within the Kuznets curve framework in the long run. Financial development (money supply) was negatively correlated with income inequality. The study further validates the TKC hypothesis, revealing an inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality. Financial development, measured by domestic credit to the private sector, also shows a negative correlation with income inequality within the TKC framework. However, the money supply demonstrates a positive link with income inequality. The study recommended the necessity to prioritize policies that support technological innovation through subsidies, encouragement for research and development, and collaborations between the public and private sectors will greatly lower income inequality and support achieving Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG10). Financial development significantly facilitates access to financial services and contributes to diminishing income inequality by building an effective and inclusive banking system (mobile banking services for poor communities), easing access to credit for emerging and small and midsize enterprises (SMEs), and money circulation. Governments should strategically allocate resources toward programs and initiatives that directly address income inequality and promote inclusive growth.

Through strategically encouraging innovation, applying targeted government expenditure, and facilitating sustainable financial development, Asian countries may close the income gap and achieve inclusive growth and shared prosperity. In recent years, there has been a notable surge in the differences in income distribution between rich and poor countries, consequently yielding adverse repercussions. In this respect, Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG10) necessitates reducing inequalities in outcomes, is about reducing inequality and is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 and the full title is “Reduce inequality within and among countries. The widening gap in income inequality with the advent of advanced technology, financial development, and rapid economic growth requires identifying this paradox and taking decisive action to solve it. Researchers and decision-makers must focus their questions on this paradox mystery. Among other factors, cutting-edge technology and financial development are seen as the main players in high economic growth. However, the widening income inequality gap persists. Currently, the world's wealthiest 10 % of the population receives 52 % of the universal income compared to 8.5 % for the poorest 50 %. In the top 10 % of the global income distribution, the average income yearly is €87,200 per person, while the annual income per person in the bottom 50 % is €2800 of the global income distribution (Chancel et al., 2022 ). When biased-directed technology change is introduced, it tends to favor labor-intensive paths when wages are low and capital-intensive technologies when wages are high. However, wage inequality is caused by and the result of this bias (Antonelli and Scellato, 2019 ). Technological innovation is widely acknowledged as a significant factor influencing macroeconomic variables (Cetin et al., 2021 ). It would significantly reduce income inequality and raise the income shares of the poorest in developing countries if ICTs were made more accessible and used for the benefit of the most vulnerable (Nga Ndjobo and Ngah Otabela, 2023 ). Furthermore, poverty reduction and equitable income distribution are the top government or policymaker goals striving to realize. Various tools are utilized to attain better income dissemination and reduce inequality. To lessen inequality, most governments concentrate on adopting a distinct fiscal policy. Public transfers, government spending, and progressive taxes are some policies used to combat rising inequality (Selim and Güngör, 2021 ). To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 10 in developing countries mainly, decreasing income inequality and improving access to financial institutions are the main pivotal policies to attain Goal 10 (Destek et al., 2020 ). Although technological innovation promises to boost the economy and create jobs, its advantages are not shared equitably, and in the absence of proper regulations and interventions, it may exacerbate income inequality by pushing out numerous employees and countries and favoring wealthy individuals, highly qualified employees, and most powerful players in a competition that takes markets worldwide. Technological advancements can improve society by increasing productivity, fostering the emergence of new industries, and promoting economic growth. These elements may have a cascading effect increasing employment opportunities, raising incomes for some societal groups, and ultimately lowering income inequality (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), 2018 ). Though much study has been done on the relationship between energy innovation and economic growth, less has been discovered concerning how the level of energy innovation affects inequality in income across a country (Sinha et al., 2020 ). Moreover, financial markets fundamentally include resource allocation; also, they can be considered the “brain” of the whole economic system and the central position of decision-making (Stiglitz, 1993 ). A robust and stabilized growth in the financial system has the power to smooth the sustainability of economic activities (Sugiyanto and Yolanda, 2020 ). The widespread COVID-19 disclosed the weakness of financial systems and non-inclusive economic growth to bear the economic consequences resulting from the constraints imposed as measures to control the morbidity deployment. Income inequality is one of these prominent consequences. The echo has been channeled to economists and leaders to rebuild resilient financial systems to support economic growth that takes into consideration protection measures to reduce income inequality exacerbation in case these turbulent situations are repeated. Returning the stability and flexibility of the financial system supports strong and sustained economic growth (Narain et al., 2012 ). It should be recalled that Asia has rapidly advanced in human development, literacy, innovation, and economic progress over the past ten years due to widening its infrastructure and technological capabilities. Asia has adopted the digital revolution in various sectors, including banking, manufacturing, transportation, e-commerce, healthcare, retail, and finance (Roy, 2022 ). Asia has appeared as a driving force in innovation. Prior to the pandemic, the region was responsible for more than 50 % of all patents in the world, including 60 % of patents in digital and computer technologies (Dabla-Norris et al., 2023 ). China and India account for one-third of the total internet users in Asia out of 2.2 billion (Roy, 2022 ). According to Sara Lebow (2022) , Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines are the three e-commerce markets in Southeast Asia with the fastest growth rates worldwide, with digital sales growing by 36.0 %, 34.0 %, and 25.9 % this year, respectively. Growing income inequality might probably diminish the impact of economic growth on poverty reduction and undermine the basis of growth. If inequality in Asian economies persisted stable, rather than rising, growth would possibly rescue an additional 240 million people from poverty between 1990 and 2010. This 240 million represented 6.5 % of the population of developing Asia in 2010 (Asian Development Bank (ADB), 2012 ). Retaining differences associated with measurement, income inequality in the Asia-Pacific region is more than in OECD countries. In 2019, Malaysia and the Philippines had the highest Gini coefficients for income inequality above 0.40, compared with Kazakhstan, which had the lowest 0.28. Over the last ten years, income inequality in Asia-Pacific countries has persisted at about 0.35, exceeding the OECD average (0.31) (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2022 ). Innovation in terms of the invention of novel ideas created via R&D or other innovative practices that push the boundaries of technology was prominent in developed economies and in emerging economies such as China, where more incentives and funds are available for companies on the technological frontier to invest in R&D. India, Malaysia, and Thailand are among the low-and-middle-income countries in Asia that have imported High-tech more than the share of total imports in the world median (Dabla-Norris et al., 2023 ). Despite new technology, globalization, and market-oriented reform being the fundamental engines of fast growth in Asia yet were led to inequality increasing. These forces have originated substantial economic opportunities; however, there was a disparity in the distribution of these opportunities (Asian Development Bank (ADB), 2012 ). According to Woetzel and Seong (2021) , Asia is a powerful technological in region; the region was responsible for 52 % of the world's growth in tech firm revenues over the last ten years, 43 % of startup financing, 51 % of R&D expenditures, and 87 % of patents filed. As the first middle-income economy group in 2016, China has joined the top 25 of the global innovation index (Wang et al., 2023 ). It should be noted that there are several studies concerned about the role of technological innovations, financial development, and economic growth on income inequality. However, the outcomes carry different evidence, such as (Adebayo, 2023 ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Aghion et al., 2019 ; Antonelli and Gehringer, 2017 ). Concerning technological innovations, the studies by (Adebayo, 2023 ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Aghion et al., 2019 ) found technological innovations increase income inequality. On the other hand, Antonelli and Gehringer (2017)  found technological innovations decline income inequality. Simon Kuznets' (1955)  seminal work was the first to explain the correlation between growth and income inequality. Kuznets' concept hypothesized that income inequality initially increases as a country undergoes economic development and industrialization, but then decreases later. Over time, Kuznets' concept has been applied to various areas, including the environment and finance. In the environmental context, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory presents the relationship between improved economic development and a worsening environment. In the financial context, Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990)  proposed that the interaction between economic development and finance leads to an inverted U-shaped curve of income inequality, with the progress of financial intermediaries. In the context of technological innovations, Shin et al. (2009)  found that technological inventions initially increase income inequality, but as technology spreads throughout the entire economy, income inequality decreases, implying that income inequality tends to rise initially as a society experiences technological advancements. However, income inequality starts to decline once technology reaches a certain level of progress. In the financial aspect, the Financial Kuznets curve presents a modified approach to the recognized Kuznets curve, showcasing an inverted U-shaped pattern that reflects the relationship between finance and both economic growth and inequality (Khatatbeh et al., 2022 ). During the transition from an underdeveloped, slowly growing economy to a highly developed, rapidly growing one, a nation goes through a phase characterized by an expanding wealth gap between the rich and the less privileged members of society (Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990 ). The connection between technology and inequality is complex and multi-dimensional. On the one hand, technology has significantly bolstered productivity, propelled economic expansion, facilitated the dissemination of knowledge and information, and expanded accessibility to essential services. Nevertheless, it has also played a role in exacerbating inequalities (UNESCAP, 2018 ). Considering all the studies above and following the study of Shin et al. (2009) , this study makes two significant contributions. Firstly, it extended the Kuznets curve hypothesis to include the effect of technological innovations and formulated the Technological Kuznets Curve (TKC) concept. By integrating technological innovation into the Kuznets curve, this study examines the dynamic U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality in Asian countries considering some financial development indicators. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is innovative in analyzing the dynamic inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality in Asian countries by extending the Kuznets curve framework and integrating technological innovations. Furthermore, this study contributes further by enriching the path of empirical knowledge by validating the effect of financial development indicators in addition to economic growth and government expenditure on income inequality as relevant determinants of income inequality. Secondly, referring to Ahmed's (2020)  study framework about factor productivity, this study made another contribution by calculating the contributions of technological innovations, financial development, and total factor productivity to income inequality by the inclusion of government spending and economic growth as the most relevant factors to explain the dynamics of increasing income inequality in the presence of advanced technology and financial development. Following the evolution of the Simon Kuznets curve hypothesis and its extensions in many areas, the current study seeks to close the gap in the existing literature by utilizing technological innovations to extend the Kuznets curve hypothesis in the notion of technological innovation Kuznets curve (TKC) framework. This theoretical framework was developed to answer the following questions: (1) What is the shape of the relationship between technological innovations, financial development, and income inequality? This question was formulated to identify the linkages between technological innovations, financial development, and income inequality. (2) Is there an inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovation and income inequality in Asia? The purpose of the question is to determine whether or not the bond between income inequality and technological innovations resembles the Kuznets curve hypothesis, which shows that as economies experience more technological advancement, inequality initially rises and then declines. (3) How do factors like money supply and accessibility to credit mediate the relationship between technological innovation and income inequality in Asian economies? This question focuses on how the money supply and credit accessibility affect the TKC, influencing the overall course of the curve in these economies by either increasing or decreasing the effects of technological innovations on inequality. To attain the goal of this study, the pooled mean group autoregressive distributed lag model (PMG/ARDL) is used to test the inverted U-shaped hypothesis between technological innovation and income inequality in Asian nations and also to estimate the long-term and short-term link among technological advancement, financial development, economic growth, and income inequality. The theoretical framework was chosen for this study because well-suited to investigate the inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality based on Simon Kuznets' (1955)  seminal work and to answer the research questions Furthermore, the key reason PMG/ARDL has been chosen is that it permits flexible and unconstrained short-term reactions across groups meanwhile imposing long-term constraints by pooling individual groups. Asian countries were chosen in this study as emerging economies that considered high technology users. The present results of the study validate the Kuznets curve (KC) hypothesis and demonstrate that technological innovations contribute to reducing income inequality within the Kuznets curve framework in the long run. Financial development (money supply) was negatively correlated with income inequality. The study further validates the TKC hypothesis, revealing an inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality. Financial development, measured by domestic credit to the private sector, also shows a negative correlation with income inequality within the TKC framework. The results from this study provide insight into the potential of technological innovations to reduce income inequality as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The remaining parts of the study are as follows: In part 2 , the literature review highlights the existing literature. Part 3  provides the data description, model specification, and empirical techniques. Part 4  discusses the empirical results. Part 5  concludes the study and provides policy recommendations for policymakers.  2 Literature review and theoretical background 2.1 Technological innovations, financial development, and income inequality nexus In the existing literature, several studies were conducted regarding the association between economic growth, financial development, technological advancement, and income inequality. However, the outcomes varied between financial development's positive and negative impacts on income inequality. Several studies have been concerned about the role of technological innovations, financial development, and economic growth on income inequality. However, the outcomes carry different evidence, such as (Adebayo, 2023 ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Aghion et al., 2019 ; Antonelli and Gehringer, 2017 ). Concerning technological innovations, the studies by (Adebayo, 2023 ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Aghion et al., 2019 ) found technological innovations increase income inequality. It's worth mentioning that the relationship between economic growth, financial development, technological advancement, and income inequality has been the subject of numerous studies. These studies, however, have produced contradictory findings; some suggest that financial development has a positive impact on income inequality, while others suggest the opposite. Using panel data analysis, Biyase et al. (2023)  researched the BRICS nations and discovered that while financial development is linked to a decline in income inequality, technological innovation and per capita GDP are positively correlated with income inequality. A different study conducted by Jaumotte et al. (2013)  discovered that technology increases inequality and that financial globalization is associated with greater income inequality. Khatatbeh and Moosa (2023)  support the existence of an inverted U-shaped curve that links income inequality and financial development in 20 different countries. Another study by Cetin et al. (2021)  showed that technological advancements positively correlate with income inequality in Turkey and supported the validity of the financial development Kuznets curve hypothesis. These studies used various analytical techniques to investigate the relationships between these variables. Studies by Wang et al. (2023)  and Adebayo (2023)  showed that technological innovations positively affect income inequality. As new technological advancements emerge, Shin et al. (2009)  argue that income inequality rises; but, as new technological advancements encompass every aspect of the economy, income inequality declines. Biyase et al. (2023)  applied panel dynamic ordinary least squares (PDOLS), and panel fully modified ordinary least squares (PFMOLS) to test the effect of financial development and technological innovations on BRICS income inequality panel data spanning from 1990 to 2017. The outcomes reveal that technological innovation and per capita GDP are linked positively with BRICS income inequality. In contrast, financial development contributes to reducing income inequality in BRICS nations. Jaumotte et al. (2013)  found that technology considerably raises inequality, and financial globalization was positively related to income inequality. The study by Cetin et al. (2021)  analyzed the connection between technological innovations, economic growth, and income inequality in Turkey's data from 1987 to 2018. Furthermore, the financial development Kuznets curve (FKC) hypothesis was tested. ARDL bounds test, VECM Granger causality, DOLS, FMOLS, and CCR methods were used to investigate the associations among the variables. The findings revealed that technological innovations show a positive link with income inequality. However, economic growth is found to be negatively associated with income inequality. Additionally, the outcomes validate the FKC hypothesis, as indicated by the financial development positive sign and the negative sign of financial development squared. Tchamyou et al. (2019)  found that ICT leads to declines in income inequality through financial development dynamics. In a recent study, Wang et al. (2023)  applied DOLS, FMOLS, and CCR under the financial Kuznets curve (FKC) hypothesis to scrutinize the connection amid technological innovations and income inequality in China data from 1985 to 2019. Technological innovations show a positive link with the urban-rural income gap. The finding confirms the validation of the financial Kuznets curve (FKC) hypothesis in an inverted U shape. Adebayo (2023)  used the quantile-on-quantile regression techniques data from 1992Q1 to 2019Q4 for the BRICS-T countries to assess the distribution impact of technological innovations on the distribution of income. The outcomes from different countries reveal that technological innovations positively affect income inequality. Additionally, the distribution of technological innovations exhibits a negative connection with income inequality distribution. Shin et al. (2009)  used data from OECD members and studied the link between technological progress and the Gini index. The empirical results show that the Kuznets curve is increasing and decreasing as long as technological progress occurs occasionally. Tang et al. (2022)  found that technological innovation reduced inequality in the long term in High-income and Middle-low-income countries by using FMOLS and DOLS methods. Government expenditure declines inequality across all quantiles. Reducing income inequality and boosting access to financial institutions are the two primary critical policies that developing nations must implement to fulfill Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Destek et al., 2020 ). Financial markets fundamentally include resource allocation; also, they can be considered the “brain” of the whole economic system and the central position of decision-making (Stiglitz, 1993 ). Selim and Güngör (2021)  scrutinize the link between financial development and income inequality from 1990 to 2015 in 11 selected MENA countries. The empirical result indicates a negative correlation among financial development, inflation, and income inequality. Destek et al. (2020)  used four financial development indices to test the link between income inequality and financial development in Turkey in the period 1990–2015 by using the ARDL model. The result shows that real income and government expenditures negatively influenced income inequality in the long run, while inflation positively influenced income inequality. The overall financial development shows a positive connection with income inequality. Bittencourt et al. (2019)  found financial development positively connected with income inequality from 1976 to 2011 by using fixed-effect estimation in the 50 U.S. states. Khatatbeh and Moosa (2023)  applied FMOLS and the unobserved components model (UCM) to test the financial Kuznets curve hypothesis using data from 20 developing and developed nations. The findings support the existence of an inverted U-shaped FKC and the U-shaped curve in >50 % of the countries under consideration. Utilizing panel data spanning from 1990 to 2015, Younsi and Bechtini (2020)  studied the causal relations among income inequality, financial development, and economic growth in BRICS countries. The outcomes approved the presence of Kuznets' inverted U-shaped hypothesis amid economic growth and income inequality. Also, the outcomes confirmed the validity of Kuznets' inverted U-shaped hypothesis amid financial development and income inequality. Technological innovation is widely acknowledged as a significant factor influencing macroeconomic variables (Cetin et al., 2021 ). Financial markets fundamentally include resource allocation; also, they can be considered the “brain” of the whole economic system and the central position of decision-making (Stiglitz, 1993 ).  2.2 Theoretical background and research gap Simon Kuznets' (1955)  seminal work was the first to explain the correlation between growth and income inequality. Kuznets' concept hypothesized that income inequality initially increases as a country undergoes economic development and industrialization, but then decreases later. During the early stages of economic development, income inequality tends to rise. This can be attributed to factors such as concentrated wealth and resources, unequal access to education and opportunities, and the emergence of new economic sectors that primarily benefit a small group of individuals or industries. Kuznets' theory has been used in many fields throughout history. In the environmental context, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory presents the relationship between improved economic development and a worsening environment. In the financial context, Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990)  proposed that the interaction between economic development and finance leads to an inverted U-shaped curve of income inequality, with the progress of financial intermediaries. This suggests that during the initial phases of financial development, only a limited number of relatively wealthy individuals can access financial markets. In the context of technological innovations, Shin et al. (2009)  found that technological inventions initially increase income inequality, but as technology spreads throughout the entire economy, income inequality decreases. Therefore, based on the Kuznets curve hypothesis, this study suggested an inverted U-shaped pattern between technological innovations and income inequality in Asian selected nations in the presence of financial development indicators. Income inequality tends to rise initially as a society becomes involved in technological advancements but starts to decline once technology reaches a certain level of progress. Technological innovation is considered an essential macroeconomic variable (Cetin et al., 2021 ). A few studies have considered technological innovation as a significant factor affecting income inequality (Biyase et al., 2023 ; Jaumotte et al., 2013 ; Cetin et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2023 ; Adebayo, 2023 ). However, there is a deficiency in studies that shed light on the inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality. Taking into account all of the studies mentioned above and going with the line of Shin et al. (2009) , this study made notable contributions as pioneering in extending the Kuznets curve hypothesis by incorporating technological innovation in a concept of the technological Kuznets curve (TKC) to analyze the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of technological innovation on income inequality in Asian countries and fill the gap in the previous studies. Additionally, this considered Ahmed's (2020)  framework to calculate technological innovations, financial development, and total factor productivity growth contributions to income inequality by the inclusion of government spending and economic growth as the most relevant factors to explain the dynamics of increasing income inequality in the presence of advanced technology and financial development. Accordingly, this study intends to examine the relationship between technological innovations, financial development, and income inequality in a sample of Asian countries and test the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of technological innovations on income inequality in the presence of financial development indicators. Based on the above literature surveyed, theoretical background, and research gap, the following hypotheses were formulated to test this theoretical frame and answer research questions.Hypothesis 1 The enhancement of technological innovation and financial development is beneficial to reducing income inequality.   Hypothesis 2 There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality.   Hypothesis 3 Financial development indicators contribute to declining income inequality in the presence of a dynamic U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality.    Compared to previous research, through the use of technological innovation in the Kuznets Curve (KC) framework, this study employs an innovative approach by expanding the Kuznets curve framework to analyze the dynamic inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality in the idea of technological innovations Kuznets curve (TKC). A more erudite understanding of the relationship between technological innovation and income inequality is provided by the study to fill the gaps in the literature through a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing income inequality in Asian countries by incorporating technological innovation into the analysis alongside financial development, economic growth, and government spending.   3 Methodology and data This study examines how technological innovations, economic growth, and financial development influence inequality in income within the Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Based on the hypotheses formulated, this study contributes by integrating technological innovations in the Kuznets curve hypothesis in terms of the technological Kuznets curve hypothesis (TKC) to analyze the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of technological innovation on income inequality and fill the gap in the previous studies. Technological innovation is recognized as a primary factor influencing macroeconomic variables (Cetin et al., 2021 ). According to the Kuznets curve hypothesis, income inequality and income per capita income have an inverted U-shaped connection, income inequality gets worse in the early phases of economic growth and gets better as development goes on. Therefore, the framework of this study is built based on the conventional Kuznets curve framework as presented below. It postulates that income inequality rises during early economic development before falling.(1) LGI t  = α 0  + α 1  L GDP t  + α 2  LGDP t 2  + μ 1 t      where: L  indicates the natural logarithm; GI  is the Gini coefficient; GDP  is the economic growth; GDP2  is the square of economic growth. α0  is the intercept, μit  is the error term; α1  and α2  are the coefficients of economic growth and describe the trend of increasing and decreasing income inequality based on Kuznets hypothesis. α1  > 0 indicating rising income inequality at the initial of economic development. α2  < 0 signifying the decline of income inequality as the economy develops. Eqs. (2) and (3)  below are an extension of the conventional Kuznets curve framework to evaluate the influence of technological innovations, financial development (as measured by domestic credit to the private sector and money supply), and government expenditure as relevant determinants of income inequality in this study.(2) LGI t  = α 0  + α 1  L APP t  + α 2  L DC t  + α 3  LGD P t  + α 4  LGDP t 2  + α 5  L G t  + μ 2 t      where: APP , DC , and G  are technological innovations, Domestic credit (financial development), and government expenditure respectively. Eq. (3)  represents Eq. (2)  by replacing domestic credit as a proxy for financial development variable by money supply (M ).(3) LGI t  = α 0  + α 1  L APP t  + α 2  L M t  + α 3  LGD P t  + α 4  LGDP t 2  + α 5  L G t  + μ 2 t       Based on the general framework of the Kuznets curve hypothesis and following the studies of Shin et al., 2009  and Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990) , Eqs. (4) and (5)  are presented to test the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of technological innovation on income inequality in the concept of technological innovations Kuznets curve hypothesis, in Eq. (4)  domestic credit to the private sector used to represent financial development, while in Eq. (5) , financial development is captured by money supply (LM). LAPP 2   is the square of technological innovations, which signifies the direction of technological innovations on income inequality as the economy develops.(4) LGI t  = α 0  + α 1  L APP t  + α 2  LAPP t 2  + α 3  L DC t  + α 4  LGD P t  + α 5  L G t  + μ 2 t      (5) LGI t  = α 0  + α 1  L APP t  + α 2  LAPP t 2  + α 3  L M t  + α 4  LGD P t  + α 5  L G t  + μ 2 t       This theoretical framework aims to test the validity of the technological innovations Kuznets curve hypothesis (TKC). To test the validity of the proposed model, this study provided signs of expectations between income inequality and independent variables. Based on the Kuznets curve (KC) hypothesis, economic growth and square of economic growth are expected to have positive and negative signs with income inequality, respectively (∂ L GI t   ∂ LGDP t    > 0 )  and ∂ L GI t   ∂ LGDP t 2    < 0    . Technological innovations increase income inequality at the new appearance of technological progress and then decrease as that technology spreads throughout (Shin et al., 2009) . Therefore, based on the technological innovations Kuznets curve hypothesis, technological innovations and square of technological innovations are expected to have negative and positive signs with income inequality, respectively (∂ L GI t   ∂ LAPP t    > 0 )  and ∂ L GI t   ∂ LAPP t 2    < 0    . Financial development is predicted to have a negative association with income inequality∂ L GI t   ∂ LDC t     and  ∂ L GI t   ∂ LM t    < 0   ,  this suggests that financial services are already more readily available and affordable for low-income people. Similarly, government expenditure is expected to be negatively linked with income inequality ∂ L GI t   ∂ LG t    < 0   .   To calculate the contributions of technological innovations, financial development, and total factor productivity to income inequality, Eqs. (2), (3), (4), and (5)  are reformulated in Eqs. (6), (7), (8), and (9) , respectively. In calculating total factor productivity indicators, the intercept has no longer been used. The residuals in Eqs. (2), (3), (4), and (5)  are utilized as a proxy for the total factor productivity and economic technological progress (Ahmed, 2020 ).(6) ∆ ln TFP i , t   = ∆ lnG I i , t   − α 1  . ∆ ln APP i , t   + α 2  . ∆ ln DC i , t   + α 3  . ∆ ln GDP i , t   + α 4  . ∆ ln GDP i , t  2  + α 5  . ∆ ln G i , t        (7) ∆ ln TFP i , t   = ∆ lnG I i , t   − α 1  . ∆ ln APP i , t   + α 2  . ∆ ln M i , t   + α 3  . ∆ ln GDP i , t   + α 4  . ∆ ln GDP i , t  2  + α 5  . ∆ ln G i , t        (8) ∆ ln TFP i , t   = ∆ lnG I i , t   − α 1  . ∆ ln APP i , t   + α 2  . ∆ ln APP i , t  2  + α 3  . ∆ ln DC i , t   + α 4  . ∆ ln GDP i , t   + α 5  . ∆ ln G i , t        (9) ∆ ln TFP i , t   = ∆ lnG I i , t   − α 1  . ∆ ln APP i , t   + α 2  . ∆ ln APP i , t  2  + α 3  . ∆ ln M i , t   + α 4  . ∆ ln GDP i , t   + α 5  . ∆ ln G i , t        where the share of the average values is weighted as: ∆ ln TFP it    Is the total factor productivity; ∆ lnG I i , t     is income inequality; α 1  . ∆ ln APP i , t    is the technological innovations contribution; α 2  . ∆ ln DC i , t    is the domestic credit contribution; α 3  . ∆ ln GDP i , t    is the economic growth contribution; α 4  . ∆ ln GDP i , t  2    is the square of economic growth contribution; α 5  . ∆ ln G i , t    is the contribution of government expenditure; α 2  . ∆ ln M i , t     is money supply contribution; α 2  . ∆ ln APP i , t  2    is the square of technological innovation contribution. 3.1 Data sources The current study employed panel data from 7 Asian nations (China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Korea) covering 2000–2019 based on data availability to scrutinize the association amid technological innovation, financial development, economic growth, and income inequality under the theoretical framework of the Kuznets curve (KC) hypothesis and validate inverted U-shaped hypothesis of technological innovation on income inequality in the concept of technological innovations Kuznets curve hypothesis. The dependent variable is the Gini coefficient (GI ) used to measure income inequality (Khatatbeh et al., 2022 ; Cetin et al., 2021 ). The independent variables domestic credit to the private sector (DC ) and money supply (M ) are used to measure financial development (Cetin et al., 2021 ). Per capita gross domestic product represents economic growth (Cetin et al., 2021 ). Technological innovations (APP ) captured by residents' patent applications. Government expenditure is used as a control variable measured by final consumption expenditure as a percentage of GDP . Technological innovations and financial development are the main independent variables included in this analysis; to test the Kuznets Curve (KC) theory, economic growth additionally applies to this purpose. Furthermore, government expenditures are considered the most important variables used to control in this study. Gini coefficient data was collected from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID). Data on technological innovation, financial development, per capita Gross domestic product, and government spending were generated from the World Bank Indicator (WBI) published by the World Bank (2023) . Variables are transformed into a natural logarithm. Further details about data and sources are available in Table 1  .  3.2 Methodology 3.2.1 Cross-sectional dependence tests This study used cross-sectional dependence tests of bias-corrected scaled, (Pesaran, 2004 ) scaled LM and (Pesaran, 2004 ) scaled CD, (Baltagi et al., 2012 ), and (Breusch and Pagan, 1980 ) LM to determine the stationarity of technological innovations, economic growth, financial development, and income inequality. The tests were used to determine whether the panel data had a cross-sectional dependence based on the null hypothesis of no cross-section dependence and to choose the appropriate panel unit root tests.  3.2.2 Panel unit root and cointegration tests To prevent the estimation of unreliable regression, the stationary features of the panel series were emphasized in this study by utilizing the first-generation panel unit root tests of Maddala & Wu Fisher Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), and Phillips and Perron (PP), Maddala and Wu (1999) , Levin et al. (2002) , and Im et al. (2003)  tests. The dynamics of every panel unit are assumed to be homogeneous (Levin et al., 2002 ). Maddala and Wu (1999)  and Im et al. (2003)  advocated heterogeneity in all panel units, while Maddala and Wu Fisher Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips and Perron (PP). Accordingly, the panel cointegration tests by Pedroni (1999)  and Kao (1999)  were used to examine the panel cointegration relationship between technological innovations, financial development, economic growth, and income inequality. The instituting long-run cointegration among technological innovations, financial development, economic growth, and income inequality supports estimating the long-run and short-run relationship.  3.2.3 Panel ARDL method (PMG/ARDL) The establishment of a long-run cointegration relationship among technological innovations, financial development, economic growth, and income inequality allows us to estimate the targeted models. This study applied the PMG/ARDL developed by (Pesaran et al., 1999 ). The key reason PMG/ARDL has been chosen is that it permits flexible and unconstrained short-term reactions across groups meanwhile imposing long-term constraints by pooling individual groups. Additionally, the panel Granger causality test introduced by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012)  is applied to determine the causality among income inequality, technological innovations, financial development, and economic growth. The Monte Carlo simulations show that Dumitrescu and Hurli's methodology provides harmonious results when cross-sectional dependency exists (Destek and Sarkodie, 2019 ). To calculate the contributions of technological innovations, financial development, and total factor productivity to income inequality, the long-run estimated coefficient values from PMG/ARDL will be substituted into the original models.    4 Results and discussion In this study, some descriptive statistics and correlations are calculated to highlight the fundamental features of the variables, as represented in Table 2  . The upper part of Table 2  shows the summary measurements descriptive statistics and correlations for all variables. It observed that technological innovations (LAPP ) show the highest mean while government expenditure (LG ) shows a low average over the tested period. When skewness values approach 0, it indicates all variables are normal. Furthermore, small values of the Jarque-Bera probability suggest that all variables are normally distributed, which is confirmed in this study. The lower part of Table 2  displays the correlation analysis between the variables. As seen from the findings, the Gini coefficient (GI ) correlates with all variables negatively. This suggests that technological innovations, financial development, and economic growth can be used as essential factors to reduce income inequality in Asian countries under study. On the other hand, all the variables are related to each other positively, where technological innovations and financial development (LDC  and LM ) show a moderate correlation. Furthermore, financial development (LDC ) revealed strong positive with economic growth and government expenditure. Additionally, the cross-sectional dependence tests were calculated and presented in Table 3  . The results of these four tests support the rejection of the null hypothesis that the cross-sectional dependence does not exist and accept the alternative hypothesis at a 1 % significance level. After finishing the descriptive statistics, correlations analysis, and cross-section dependence tests, the study continued to test the stationarity of the variables with the unit root tests. The results are depicted in Table 4  . The results in Table 2  reveal that GI, LAPP, LAPP 2  , LDC, LGDP, LGDP 2  , LG , and LM  were stationary at the first difference in all three-unit root tests, except GI  was non-stationary based on the ADF test. Next, to establish the stationarity of the variables, the panel cointegration tests by Pedroni and Kao were performed to study the cointegration linkage between LAPP, LAPP 2  , LDC, LGDP, LGDP 2  , LG, LM , and GI . The findings are shown in Table 5  . The empirical results of the Pedroni and Kao cointegration tests indicate that most of the statistics are significant and suggest rejecting the null hypothesis, which says there is no co-integration relationship, and accepting the alternative hypothesis, which confirms that all the variables are co-integrated with income inequality. The long-run and short-run coefficients in this study are estimated using the PMG/ARDL method for four models, as recorded in Table 6  . Model 1 represents the conventional Kuznets curve framework which includes technological innovations, financial development as measured by domestic credit to the private sector, and government expenditure as relevant determinants of income inequality in this study. Furthermore, in model 2, financial development is captured by money supply. Based on the general framework of the Kuznets curve, this study reformulates the framework of the Kuznets curve to test the validity of the technological innovations Kuznets curve hypothesis (TKC) presented in Model 3, domestic credit to the private sector used to represent financial development. In Model 4, financial development is captured by money supply. Model 1 shows that under the framework of the Kuznets curve, the long-run elasticity of technological innovations with income inequality is negative (−0.037702) and statistically significant at 1 % level, suggesting that a 1 % escalation in technological innovations will contribute to a decline in income inequality by 0.037702 %. This result is compatible with (Antonelli and Gehringer, 2017 ) and disagrees with (Biyase et al., 2023 ; Jaumotte et al., 2013 ; Cetin et al., 2021 ). Technological advancements have the power to improve society by increasing productivity, fostering the emergence of new industries, and fostering growth in the economy. These elements may have a cascading effect, increasing employment opportunities, raising incomes for some societal groups, and ultimately lowering income inequality (UNESCAP, 2018 ). Financial development (domestic credit to the private sector) is insignificantly linked with income inequality with a negative sign. The sign of LGDP  is positive and LGDP 2   negative with income inequality reveals that the finding confirms the validation of the Kuznets curve (KC) hypothesis in this study and agrees with (Younsi and Bechtini, 2020 ) in BRICS countries. This finding explains that in the selected Asian countries, income inequality initially increased due to the country's expansion in economic development and industrialization, and then income inequality decreased with advanced development progress. Regarding government expenditure, it is seen that government expenditure supports reducing income inequality; a 1 % surge in government expenditure shrinks income inequality by 0.049264 % in the long run. This result agrees with (Tang et al., 2022 ). In Model 2, financial development is captured by money supply and displays a significant negative link with income inequality, revealing that a 1 % surge in financial development falls income inequality by 0.275768 % in the long run in the selected Asian countries. Expanding financial inclusion and enhancing access to financial services would reduce income inequality by developing effective and inclusive banking systems and facilitating access to credit for poor SMEs and individuals. On the other hand, government expenditure does not support diminishing income inequality. Regarding the technological Kuznets curve (TKC) in models 3 and 4, the coefficients of LAPP  and LAPP 2   are statistically significant with positive and negative signs, respectively at 1 % significance level. The findings reveal the validity of the TKC hypothesis supported by (Shin et al., 2009 ). Technological progress is often seen as potentially contributing to income inequality, following a pattern of the inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve. In the early stages of technological innovation, factors like automation, skills-biased technological developments, and wealth accumulation in technology-based sectors could broaden the income gap. However, as technology diffuses and grows more widely accessible in later stages of proliferation, this may help reduce income inequality. Technology can boost productivity, create new jobs, and raise living standards for a broader segment of society. Financial development, as captured by domestic credit to the private sector shows a negative sign at a 1 % significant level with income inequality under the technological Kuznets curve (TKC) framework. On the contrary, money supply as an indicator of financial development demonstrates a significant positive link with income inequality under the technological Kuznets curve (TKC) framework. In model 3, government expenditure does not support diminishing income inequality. However, government expenditure in Model 4 was found to support income inequality reduction. The results obtained from this analysis provide valuable economic insights about income inequality concerning the role of technological innovations, government spending, and financial development. First, the analysis shows that, within the context of the Kuznets curve, innovations in technology substantially impact inequality in income. This result does not validate the first hypothesis; however, it supports the idea that technological advancements may stimulate economic expansion, improve productivity, and lead to the emergence of new industries, all of which can reduce inequality in income later. This demonstrates how technological breakthroughs have the power to improve society by creating more job opportunities and raising wages, especially for marginalized populations. Secondly, the analysis also emphasizes how crucial financial development is in affecting income inequality. The money supply has a strong negative correlation with income inequality, whereas domestic credit to the private sector has little bearing on it. This finding supports the first hypothesis validity regarding the financial development indicator in this study and suggests that increasing access to financial services and financial inclusion can help reduce income inequality, especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) and those with restricted credit options. Finally, the finding validates the existence of the TKC hypothesis and supports the third hypothesis of this study. Technological progress is often seen as potentially contributing to income inequality, following a pattern of the inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve. In the early stages of technological innovation, factors like automation, skills-biased technological developments, and wealth accumulation in technology-based sectors could broaden the income gap. In conclusion, the results emphasize how intricately financial advancements, technology advancements, and income inequality interact. Comprehending these correlations is imperative in establishing effective strategies that endeavor to foster equitable growth and mitigate income inequality in Asian nations. In the short term, the coefficients of error correction model ECM (−1) have shown negative signs in four models. However, the coefficients are found statistically significant in models 1 and 2; this explains that the deviation from a long-run equilibrium in the period due to the short-run shock will be corrected 0.151583 %, 0.117479 %, 0.133179 %, and 0.259221 % annually. Based on the long-run estimated coefficients, the next step is to calculate the contributions of technological innovations, financial development, and total factor productivity to income inequality, as presented in Table 7  . Table 7  demonstrates that the contributions of total factor productivity are diverse between negative and positive. In model 1, although the positive contribution of economic growth, the contribution of total factor productivity was negative, with an average percent value of (−0.1926). This may result from the negative contributions of technological innovations, financial development (domestic credit to the private sector), and government expenditure within the Kuznets curve (KC) hypothesis and due to the country's expansion in economic development and industrialization progress. Similarly, in model 2, the contribution of total factor productivity was negative, with an average low value of (−0.0803) despite the positive contribution of economic growth and government expenditure with average percent values of (0.9655) and (0.0008), respectively. Under the technological innovations Kuznets curve (TKC) hypothesis in Model 3, the contribution of total factor productivity was positive with an average percent of the value of (1.6508) when domestic credit to the private sector was used to measure financial development. It's worth mentioning that among other factors, technological innovations have shown a high positive contribution to the total factor productivity in model 3. This might be attributed to the supportive role played by domestic credit to the private sector in financing technological innovations in the selected Asian countries. This result is in line with (Roy's, 2022 ) point of view which can be explained that during this period Asia widened its infrastructure and technological capabilities which resulted in rapidly advanced human development, literacy, innovation, economic progress, and digital revolution adoption in various sectors including banking and finance. Technological advancements can improve society by increasing productivity, fostering the emergence of new industries, and promoting economic growth (UNESCAP, 2018 ). Technology can boost productivity, create new jobs, and raise living standards for a broader segment of society. In model 4, regardless of the positive contributions of technological innovations and economic growth, however, the contribution of total factor productivity was negative with average percent values of (−0.3992), this might be due to the high negative contribution of government expenditure. Therefore, encouraging more government expenditure and efficient government spending toward technological innovations will significantly improve the total factor productivity. The panel Granger causality test by Dumitrescu & Hurlin is applied to examine the causality relationships among income inequality, technological innovations, financial development, and economic growth, as shown in Table 8  . The empirical results manifest a unidirectional causality from technological innovations to income inequality, which is inconsistent with (Cetin et al., 2021 ). Bidirectional causality linkage was found between financial development and income inequality, as supported by Wang et al. (2023)  and (Cetin et al., 2021 ). Additionally, bidirectional causality was identified from economic growth to income inequality, square of economic growth to income inequality. Also, from this result, unidirectional causality was detected from government expenditure to income inequality. Furthermore, unidirectional causality was detected from LAPP  to LDC ; LAPP  to LG ; LGDP  and LGDP 2   to LDC . LGDP 2   and LGDP  cause each other. Also, Bidirectional causality was seen among government expenditure, economic growth, and LGDP2 .  5 Conclusion and policy implications This study investigates the relationship between technological innovations, financial development, and income inequality implications on achieving Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG10) in seven Asian economies via testing the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of technological innovation on income inequality in the concept of technological innovations Kuznets curve hypothesis. The significant contribution of this study is introducing the Technological Kuznets Curve (TKC) as an extension to the KC framework to capture the impact of technology innovation on income inequality. Income inequality is measured using the Gini coefficient (GI ). Financial development is represented by domestic credit to the private sector (DC ) and money supply (M ). Economic growth is measured by per capita gross domestic product (GDP ). Technological innovations are measured by residents' patent applications (APP ). Government expenditure is included as a control variable and is measured by final consumption expenditure as a percentage of GDP . The PMG/ARDL approach was applied to estimate the long-run and short-run coefficients in the developed models. The theoretical framework was chosen for this study because well-suited to investigate the inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovations and income inequality based on Simon Kuznets' seminal work and to answer the research questions Furthermore, the key reason PMG/ARDL has been chosen is that it permits flexible and unconstrained short-term reactions across groups meanwhile imposing long-term constraints by pooling individual groups. Asian countries were chosen in this study as emerging economies that considered high technology users. The contributions of technological innovations, financial development, and total factor productivity to income inequality were calculated based on long-run estimated coefficients. The Granger causality test by Dumitrescu and Hurlin was also applied to check causality among the variables. The results from LLC, Im, ADF, and PP unit root tests show that GI, LAPP, LAPP 2  , LDC, LGDP, LGDP 2  , LG,  and LM  are stationary at the first difference. The outcomes from the panel cointegration tests by Pedroni and Kao point out the rejection of the null hypothesis, which says there is no co-integration relationship and accepted the alternative hypothesis that all the variables are co-integrated with income inequality. The empirical results demonstrate that the long-run elasticity of technological innovations with income inequality is negative under the framework of the Kuznets curve and statistically significant at a 1 % level. Financial development (domestic credit to the private sector) is insignificantly linked with income inequality with a negative sign. However, financial development displays a significant negative link with income inequality when captured by the money supply. The sign of LGDP  positive and LGDP 2   negative confirms the validation of the Kuznets curve (KC) hypothesis. This implies that when the economies of the chosen Asian countries expanded and became more industrialized, inequality in income first rose there before declining as those nations' levels of advanced development improved. Regarding government expenditure, it is seen that government expenditure supports reducing income inequality in models 1 and 4. Concerning the technological Kuznets curve (TKC) in the model, the coefficients of LAPP  and LAPP 2   are statistically significant with positive and negative signs, respectively, supporting the validity of the TKC hypothesis. Technological progress is often viewed as a possible driver of income inequality, which can be depicted by the inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve. Therefore, in the initial phases of technological innovation, income inequality may increase due to factors like skill-biased technological change, automation, and the concentration of wealth in technology-centric sectors. Nevertheless, as technology spreads and becomes more accessible in later stages, it has the potential to mitigate income inequality. This is because it can enhance productivity, create new employment prospects, and elevate living standards for a larger segment of society. Financial development captured by domestic credit to the private sector shows a negative sign at a 1 % significant level with income inequality under the technological Kuznets curve (TKC) framework. On the contrary, money supply as an indicator of financial development demonstrates a significant positive link with income inequality under the technological Kuznets curve (TKC) framework. In the short term, the coefficients of error correction model ECM (−1) have shown negative signs in four models. However, the coefficients are found statistically significant in models 1 and 2, this explains that the deviation from a long-run equilibrium in the period due to the short-run shock will be corrected 0.151583 %, 0.117479 %, 0.133179 %, and 0.259221 % annually. Under the technological innovations Kuznets curve (TKC) hypothesis, total factor productivity was positively contributed when domestic credit to the private sector was used to measure financial development. This might be attributed to the supportive role played by domestic credit to the private sector in financing technological innovations in the selected Asian countries. Dumitrescu & Hurlin Granger's causality indicates a unidirectional causality from technological innovations to income inequality. Bidirectional causality linkage was found between financial development and income inequality. Additionally, bidirectional causality was identified from economic growth to income inequality, square of economic growth to income inequality. Also, from this result, unidirectional causality was detected from government expenditure to income inequality. Furthermore, unidirectional causality was detected from LAPP  to LDC; LAPP  to LG; LGDP  and LGDP 2   to LDC.  Finally, LGDP 2   and LGDP  cause each other. Also, Bidirectional causality was detected among government expenditure, economic growth, and LGDP 2  . 5.1 Theoretical implications This study contributes theoretically by extending the Kuznets curve (KC) hypothesis framework to test the inverted U-shaped hypothesis of technological innovation on income inequality in the concept of technological Kuznets curve hypothesis by including technological innovations as a target variable. The proposed framework upgrades the knowledge base status quo following the Kuznets curve hypothesis which predicts an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic development and inequality. This framework has advanced in considering factors that impact income inequality in the technological revolution (technological innovation) era to consolidate and achieve reduced inequality as one of the Sustainable Development Goals, Goal 10 (SDG10).  5.2 Policy implications The study's empirical results demonstrate the critical role of technological innovations in mitigating income inequality. Technological innovations facilitate access to goods and services and serve vulnerable communities by enhancing local production marketing, creating new small businesses, and fostering education engagement. Therefore, policies that support technological innovation through subsidies, encouragement for research and development, and collaborations between the public and private sectors will greatly lower income inequality and support achieving Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG10). Following the technological Kuznets curve (TKC) hypothesis, financial development significantly facilitates access to financial services and contributes to diminishing income inequality by building an effective and inclusive banking system (mobile banking services for poor communities), easing access to credit for emerging and small and midsize enterprises (SMEs), and money circulation. Policies that support initiatives to advance digital finance knowledge through technological innovations and financial inclusion would help to overcome income inequality. Sustainable economic growth is essential to decrease income inequality, several strategies must be implemented, including funding the development of new infrastructure, encouraging the advancement of digital technologies, creating jobs, and growing certain businesses. Reducing income inequality often requires careful and multidimensional strategies, like utilizing technology advancements, encouraging financial development, boosting economic growth, and facilitating effective government spending policies. By providing public goods, social security systems, and social justice government spending plays a critical role in reducing the income gaps. In addition, the government ought to prioritize funding for social security programs, healthcare, and education to guarantee access to these vital services and equitable possibilities. Strong evaluation procedures and efficient public spending are required to guarantee resource allocation and access to the most vulnerable.  5.3 Limitations and future scope of the research This study analyzed the integration of technological innovations in the Kuznets curve hypothesis (KC) by analyzing the inverted U-shaped hypothesis between technological innovation on income inequality in seven Asian economies. This study is restricted by the availability of data and methods selected to estimate the data are limited as well. Therefore, future studies can modify the knowledge base status quo and consider critical factors that impact income inequality in the era of technological and financial revolution such as digital technology adoption, financial inclusion, green technology, and institutional quality. Furthermore, future studies can apply panel data methods like dynamic panel data, cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL), DOLS, FMOLS, and Dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) to add more empirical evidence in this area. A comparative analysis among the spectrum of nations as well as both developing and developed countries will reshape research streams in the future.
