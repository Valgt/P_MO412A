In this issue of One Earth , zu Ermgassen et al. provide recommendations for transforming policies such as “no net loss” to effectively mitigate the full range of impacts from infrastructure development. But will avoiding harm be enough? A redesign of policies might be needed for achieving the full suite of Sustainable Development Goals.    Main Text The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) define the characteristics of a better, more sustainable world for both people and nature. Achieving these goals requires planning, action, and long-term commitments. Fortunately, much progress has been made on several goals directly related to human well-being. The percentage of people who are malnourished or live in extreme poverty is decreasing (SDGs 1 and 2), and the percentage of people who are educated and have access to water and energy is increasing (SDGs 6 and 7). In contrast, conditions continue to worsen for ecosystems and the benefits they contribute to human well-being.1   What policy tools can help us conserve biodiversity as part of the full suite of SDGs? How can tradeoffs among food, energy, infrastructure, and biodiversity be assessed and managed? A large set of strategies are needed to achieve multiple goals across a wide range of socio-ecological conditions. In this issue of One Earth , zu Ermgassen et al.2   assess the potential role of “no net loss” (NLL) policies for achieving the generally competing goals of infrastructure (SDG 9) and biodiversity on land and in water (SDGs 14 and 15, respectively). They report that 101 countries have policies that are mandatory, provide guidance, or enable voluntary offsets for offsetting biodiversity. Despite the limitations of these policies, the authors suggest that the widespread adoption of such policies indicates that it’s feasible that they could be strengthened through the adoption of a mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, restore, and offset) commonly used in NNL policies. NNL policies can be very effective at mitigating biodiversity impacts from infrastructure for specific projects. However, the authors note that the site-by-site implementation limits the broader effectiveness because either the range of impacts that are considered is limited or exceptions are allowed for certain impacts. More specifically, the impacts on biodiversity extend far beyond the mitigation of infrastructure’s immediate footprint. For example, deforestation and agricultural expansion generally follow new or improved roads. Between 2000 and 2012, 1.1 million ha of tropical forest was cleared,3   which is a close to the projected urban expansion of 1.2 million ha between 2000 and 2030 as referenced by zu Ermgassen et al. Much of this deforestation is within biodiversity hotspots across South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. To curb this loss, about 200 institutions have signed the New York Declaration on Forests since it was first adopted in 2014. This aims to halve deforestation by 2020 and eliminate it by 2030. We are far from meeting this goal. Additionally, 484 companies have made commitments related to creating sustainable supply chains for the commodities driving most of the tropical deforestation, yet only 21 report progress on their zero-deforestation commitments.4   Similar to the shortcomings of NNL, farm-level compliance of zero deforestation does not guarantee landscape-level progress. First, indirect impacts are not accounted for. Forest protection in one area can lead to deforestation in another location. Second, the policies and commitments are not consistent across organizations and political boundaries, making it difficult to track compliance. Third, reporting is largely voluntary. But a bigger problem underlies the specific shortcomings. NNL policies and zero-deforestation commitments are designed to avoid doing harm. Although avoidance is at the top of the NNL hierarchy, some might feel that the word “avoid” here carries the implicit assumption that infrastructure takes precedence over biodiversity. If the only option for meeting a NNL requirement is to avoid a development in a particular place because the biodiversity there is irreplaceable, that does not mean that no development of that type is allowed anywhere. It’s place-based avoidance. The infrastructure and the indirect impacts that follow will be located elsewhere. More of our planning efforts need to broaden the focus from single or small sets of SDGs to a broader systems approach that aims to meet multiple goals. For example, Tallis et al.5   assessed the feasibility of meeting multiple goals for biodiversity, food, energy, and water while limiting climate change to at or below 1.6°C. The World Bank includes natural capital in addition to financial capital, human capital, and infrastructure as a coarse measure of human well-being and ecosystem services in its “Changing Wealth of Nations” report.6   Erb et al.7   modeled and mapped several scenarios where croplands and pastures produce enough food to feed a growing population while avoiding deforestation. Although more limited in the range of goals included, other efforts propose global strategies for conserving biodiversity8   and building roads.9   These global and regional planning efforts outline broad goals, challenges, and opportunities. The larger-scale planning results can serve as guides for national and subnational planning efforts to achieve both local and global goals. Policies can be adopted, adapted, and created to be effective within the local socio-ecological conditions. For example, command-and-control regulations are not likely to be very effective in countries with poor governance and enforcement. As zu Ermgassen et al. note, international development banks can set requirements similar to a NNL policy, where environmental impacts of proposed projects are avoided or mitigated. However, such practices might not be required by foreign national banks, which are increasingly lending to developing countries. One multi-scale governance model that is gaining a lot of support is a “jurisdictional approach,” where governments, companies, non-governmental organizations, and local communities work together to define a structure that meets economic, social, and ecological goals.10   This approach allows for regional- and global-scale goals to help set targets within a smaller area yet enable bottom-up strategies that fit the local socio-ecological systems and are likely to be most effective at reaching the desired outcomes within a discrete political jurisdiction. Further, operationalizing the policy at a scale larger rather than project by project can reduce the problem of displacing avoided development to other locations.10   Taking a systems approach to planning, implementing, governing, and measuring outcomes for multiple goals across space and time is daunting, but it is both feasible and necessary. Simply applying more resources to expand our current efforts will still have the challenge of managing the tradeoffs among goals, some of which will take precedence over others. zu Ermgassen et al. provide insights into the potential of NNL policies to achieve both infrastructure and biodiversity goals. NNL policies are one of many important types of policies, and similar work is needed for identifying the enabling conditions needed for additional policy types to effectively produce outcomes. But, further evidence is needed to help support these efforts. This coming year offers a window of opportunity for influencing policy during the discussions about progress made toward 2020 milestones in the Convention on Biodiversity and New York Declaration on Forests.
