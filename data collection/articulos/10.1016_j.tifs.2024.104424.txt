                  Background
                  The food systems accounted for a third of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are closely related to food-derived waste generation from the residential sector and the non-residential sectors. In this regard, one need to take actions on food-derived waste management roadmap toward a circular and sustainable society. Therefore, this food-derived waste issue can be aligned with the sustainable development goals (SDGs).
               
                  Scope and approach
                  This work focused on the analysis of the updated database related to the food-derived waste generation, GHG emissions, relevant regulations, and policies/roadmaps for SDGs in Taiwan. In addition, there are four case studies in food-derived waste valorization for producing value-added products as the business models in Taiwan.
               
                  Key findings and conclusions
                  Under the regulatory measures for food-derived waste valorization in Taiwan, the contribution percentages of GHG emissions from the waste sector indicated a declining trend, decreasing from about 1.5% in 2010 to about 0.9% in 2021. In addition, the government also declared the corresponding SDG indicators in connection with the food loss & waste reduction and organic farming, thus stepping towards a circular bio-economy and sustainable society.

Handling Editor: I Oey Background The food systems accounted for a third of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are closely related to food-derived waste generation from the residential sector and the non-residential sectors. In this regard, one need to take actions on food-derived waste management roadmap toward a circular and sustainable society. Therefore, this food-derived waste issue can be aligned with the sustainable development goals (SDGs).  Scope and approach This work focused on the analysis of the updated database related to the food-derived waste generation, GHG emissions, relevant regulations, and policies/roadmaps for SDGs in Taiwan. In addition, there are four case studies in food-derived waste valorization for producing value-added products as the business models in Taiwan.  Key findings and conclusions Under the regulatory measures for food-derived waste valorization in Taiwan, the contribution percentages of GHG emissions from the waste sector indicated a declining trend, decreasing from about 1.5% in 2010 to about 0.9% in 2021. In addition, the government also declared the corresponding SDG indicators in connection with the food loss & waste reduction and organic farming, thus stepping towards a circular bio-economy and sustainable society.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports (IPCC, 2006 ; IPCC, 2019 ), the most significant GHGs should include carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ) and nitrous oxide (N2 O) because they will be discharged into the atmospheric environment from the residential and non-residential (agricultural/commercial/service/industrial) activities. Among these GHG generation sources, the food consumption and production systems may be responsible for a third of global anthropogenic GHG emissions (Al-Obadi et al., 2022 ; Cerutti et al., 2023 ; Crippa et al., 2021 ; Uen & Rodríguez, 2023 ), especially in methane. It implied that the waste management sector should be one of the most intensive sectors in the GHG emissions if taking measures and practices without eco-friendly and sustainable bio-economy through waste recycling and valorization (Maina et al., 2017 ). In order to provide a target-oriented missions by 2030 for all countries, the United Nations (UN) declared the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on December 25, 2015. Concerning the food-derived waste management (including food loss), this issue is closely related to SDG-12 (Sustainable food production and consumption) and SDG-2 (Zero hunger by wasting less food and supporting local farmers) (Saari et al., 2021 ; UN, 2023; Raya-Tapia et al., 2024 ). In this regard, one need to have food-derived waste management (FWM) roadmap toward a circular and sustainable society, especially in waste valorization in the industry (Granato et al., 2022 ; Lemaire & Limbourg, 2019 ). Although the priority solutions for the food-derived waste problem are prevention of its production at sources and recycling on side (de Sadeleer et al., 2020 ), organic waste valorization should be a sustainable option through the principles of circular bio-economy and bio-refineries (Alibardi et al., 2020 ). In this regard, food-derived waste valorization is a circular and sustainable method by converting biomass residues into value-added products like materials (e.g., feed, fertilizer), chemicals (e.g., ethanol, 1-butanol) and fuels (e.g., biogas, electricity), thus mitigating GHG emissions and creating economic benefits (Facchini et al., 2023 ). Over the past decade, various review articles have been published to summarize the new approaches in food-derived waste valorization according to the technological methods and targeted waste types (Bangar et al., 2024 ; Berenguer et al., 2023 ; Caldeira et al., 2020 ; Dahiya et al., 2018 ; Fraia et al., 2024 ; Haldar et al., 2022 ; Hassan et al., 2023 ; Isah & Ozbay, 2020 ; Kannah et al., 2020 ; Kassim et al., 2022 ; Nayak & Bhushan, 2019 ; O'Connor et al., 2021 , 2022 ; Plazzotta & Manzocco, 2019 ; Roy et al., 2023 ; Socas-Rodríguez et al., 2021 ). These technologies can be categorized into anaerobic digestion for biogas/electricity generation (Assis & Gonçalves, 2022 ; Ferdeș et al., 2022 ; Awasthi et al., 2023 ; Capson-Tojo, et al., 2016 ; Talan et al., 2021 ), thermochemical pyrolysis for carbon material production (Awasthi et al., 2023 ; Singh et al., 2022 ; Tsai et al., 2022 ), and physical separation for phytochemicals and bioactive ingredients extraction (Ahmed et al., 2020 ; Carmen et al., 2023 ; Jaouhari et al., 2023 ). The targeted food-derived waste focused on kitchen waste, post-consumption food waste, fishery residues (Cheng & Lo, 2016 ), livestock/poultry residues, and agricultural (crop/fruit/vegetable) residues (Scarano et al., 2022 ). Obviously, the generation sources of food-derived waste were from the residential, commercial, agricultural and industrial activities, thus causing the diversified waste management regulations by the local/central competent authorities. In addition, the mentioned-above review papers also lacked successful case studies on food-derived valorization, which were environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable to convert the renewable residues into the value-added products in the supply chain. Taiwan is a subtropical/tropical country in the western Pacific Ocean, featuring its high dependence on imported energy, high population density, high industrized/commercialized society, and high GHG emissions per capita. According to the legal definition, waste can be divided into general (urban) waste and industrial waste, which are basically generated from the residential sector and the non-residential sectors (industry/commerce/agriculture/service-related enterprises), respectively. Under the promotion policies for circular economy and zero waste, the waste management by the central competent authority (i.e., Ministry of Environment, MOE) in Taiwan has been changed to target waste prevention by green design and sustainable consumption (Teng et al., 2021 ), promote resource recycling by waste reuse and recovery for energy (Tsai, 2019b ), mitigate GHG emissions from waste disposal, and reduce the environmental loadings on waste treatment. Therefore, the Taiwan government promulgated the regulations of governing the valorization of kitchen waste (including waste cooking oil) from non-industrial (residential) and food-derived residues from industrial sources by designating them as mandatory recyclable items under the authorization of the Waste Management Act (WMA) (MOJ, 2023 ). Currently, the food-derived waste must be regularly reported by the on-line system and also reused as permissible raw materials for producing animal feed, organic fertilizer, biomass energy, or other value-added products. On the other hand, the Taiwan government also took its actions on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by setting Taiwan's SDGs (NCSD, 2022 ). Among these targets, SDG-12 (i.e., responsible consumption and production), SDG-7 (i.e., affordable and clean energy) and SDG-2 (i.e., zero hunger) were closely associated to food-derived waste valorization. Although the definition of food waste has become controversy and extensive (Moshtaghian et al., 2021 ), the “food-derived waste” was adopted in this work to echo any edible and reusable residues from food loss, livestock/poultry/crop production, and food processing (Kibler et al., 2018 ; O'Connor et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, this term was consistent with the Taiwan's legal system for waste management regulations because it can be generated from the residential sector and the non-residential sectors (i.e., agriculture-related enterprises and industry/commerce-related enterprises) (MOJ, 2023 ). For this featured study, there were no systematic reviews and discussions on the food-derived waste valorization with relevance to sustainable development goals in Taiwan based on the literature survey. Therefore, the aim of this work focused on the analysis of the updated database related to the food-derived waste generation, GHG emissions, relevant regulations, and policies/roadmaps for SDGs from the official websites and yearbooks (MOA, 2023 ; MOEA, 2023a ; MOEA, 2023b ; MOE, 2023a ; MOE, 2023b ; MOE, 2023c ). This work also addressed some case studies on food-derived valorization, which are environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable in the Taiwan's supply chain. To highlight the food-derived waste valorization with relevance to Taiwan's SDG indicators, the main structures of the paper will be divided into the following contents.-Status of food-derived waste management in Taiwan.  - Status of GHG emissions from the waste management (generation, collection, and valorization) in Taiwan.  - Taiwan's sustainable development goals with relevance to food-derived waste management.  -Regulatory promotion for food-derived waste valorization in Taiwan by the central competent ministries.  -New approaches in food-derived waste valorization: Four case studies in Taiwan.     2 Status of food-derived waste management in Taiwan 2.1 Generation and collection of food-related waste In Taiwan, the waste is officially divided into general waste (or municipal solid waste) and industrial waste under the Waste Management Act (MOJ, 2023 ). Obviously, the former is generated from non-industry activities, but includes general waste generated by the employees’ lives during industry activities. By contrast, the latter refers to waste that is produced from industrial activities. In order to manage waste effectively and recyclically, it has been further divided into bulk waste (e.g., tree trimming, discarded furniture), recyclable waste (e.g., waste plastic, waste paper), food-derived waste (kitchen waste, waste cooking oil), hazardous waste (e.g., fluorescent lamp, Hg-containing thermometer), and garbage. In Taiwan, bulk waste was generally categorized into garbage for combustion treatment in the large-scale municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plants. Also, food-derived waste was listed as one of “mandatory” recyclables. Regarding the generation sources of food-derived waste, it can be from residential sector and industry-related sectors (i.e., dwellings, institutions, restaurants, hotels, fast-food chains, supermarket, wholesale market, and so on). Concerning the food-derived waste management in the residential sector, the public cleaning teams under the local governments must be in charge in collecting the non-recyclable waste (garbage) and the mandatory recyclables separately. In addition, the municipal collection teams must report the collection amounts of mandatory recyclables (including food-derived waste) and garbage monthly to the Ministry of Environment (MOE) by the on-line system. Thereafter, the collected mandatory recyclables will be sold to the licensed reuse (valorization) enterprises. On the other hand, the food-derived waste (including waste cooking oil) from the industry-related sources also can be collected by municipal collection teams, or be commissioned to the licensed waste collection facilities. These collection teams or facilities also declare the collected amounts of food-derived waste monthly to the EPA by the on-line reporting system. By analyzing the updated data on industrial waste management (MOE, 2023a ) and MSW management (MOE, 2023c ), the significant results can be found on the following conclusions.- Abrupt increase in total generation amounts of MSW occurred in 2018 was due to the statistical change by including general waste from the employees' lives during industry activities. Another significant increase can be found in 2022 because of the inclusion of the non-routine discharge of garbage like natural disaster waste, large festival/event waste and concentrated burning paper money (from worship temple fairs). Concerning the food-derived waste within MSW, the generation reached the maximal amount (i.e., 834,541 metric tons) in 2012. Thereafter, it indicated a decreasing trend mainly due to the promotion for the food loss and waste (FLW) measures by the joint-venture of the central competent authorities and businesses (or retailers) (Teng et al., 2021 ). Another reason could be attributable to the decline in reusing food waste as a pig feed under the considerations of “food safety scandal” event in 2014 and “African swine fever” ending in 2019 (Tsai, 2020 ), which will be further addressed in Sec, 2-2.  - Although the composition percentages for food waste were decreasing since 2017, they ranged from 30 wt% to 40 wt% during the period of 2010–2019. Obviously, food-derived waste from the residential sector was mostly disposed of as garbage by the citizens without separation from MSW. The ban on food-derived waste disposal by grinding and then discharging into the sewer system may cause higher contents of food-derived waste in Taiwan (Crutchik et al., 2023 ). As a consequence, the energy efficiencies of large-scale MSW incineration facilities for the energy recovery by electricity generation showed only about 15–20% (Tsai, 2016 ; Tsai & Kuo, 2010 ), lower than typical levels in most developed countries (Ham & Lee, 2017 ).  - The amounts of food-derived residues from agriculture-related enterprises during the period of 2010–2022 were mostly estimated by the reasonable ratios of residues to their outputs by weight (MOA, 2023 ), not obtained by the on-line reports by the related enterprises. For example, the generation amounts of rice husk were based on the ratio (rice husk/rice yield) of 1.0. The findings showed that the majority of food-derived residues from agriculture-related enterprises were derived from rice residues and waste oyster shell. The former indicated slight variations on their generation amounts, but the latter appeared a decreasing trend in terms of its generation since 2010. It should be noted that waste clam shell, accounting for approximately 30,000 metric tons (estimated by the authors).  - Based on the on-line reporting amounts of main food-derived residues from industry/commerce-related enterprises during the period of 2010–2022 (MOE, 2023a ), the generation amounts of wine-brewing residues (including waste distiller's grains, wine lees, and alcoholic mash) ranked No. 1 and also indicated slight variations, reflecting domestic wine production stability. However, the increasing trend in terms of the generation amounts of the resulting residues stood at the food-manufacturing industries, but showed decreasing trend in the sugar-refining industry. Herein, the abrupt increase in the food-derived waste during the period of 2016–2017 was triggered by the regulatory measure on reporting requirement, which was caused by the “food safety scandal” event (Tsai, 2020 ).     2.2 Status of food-derived waste valorization In Taiwan, waste valorization is almost identical to waste reuse because “reuse” refers to the use of waste as raw material, materials, fuels, and other forms recognized by the government based on the Waste Management Act (MOJ, 2023 ). Currently, the reuse (valorization) of food-derived waste from the residential sector focused on the composting and pig feed. Other valorization options included feedstock for manufacturing livestock/poultry (animal) feed (Malenica et al., 2023 ), anaerobic digestion for the production of biogas-to-power and organic fertilizer, and feedstock for feeding black solider fly. According to the data on the corresponding amounts of composting, pig feed and other valorization methods (e.g., anaerobic digestion for producing biogas and power generation) during the period of 2010–2022 (listed in Table 1  ) (MOE, 2023c ), the valorization amounts of pig feed indicated a declining trend since 2015, which was associated with the stricter regulatory measures due to the considerations of food safety and environmental pollution (Nath et al., 2023 ; Tsai, 2018 , 2020 ). In addition, the Taiwan farmers continued to reduce food-derived waste for feeding black pigs because the practice was banned to prevent African swine fever infection during the period. By contrast, the amounts of composting and other valorization options showed a significant increase, especially in the latter. It should be mentioned that the composting valorization for producing organic fertilizer must comply with the relevant regulations like the Fertilizer Management Act and the Waste Management Act, which will be further described in the subsequent section. In addition, the regulatory incentive for promoting the production of biogas via anaerobic digestion process played a vital role in the sustainable development, which will be also connected with the development policies of circular economy and renewable energy. Concerning the valorization options of food-derived waste from agriculture-related enterprises, they focused on traditional measures, including disposal on site (as organic fertilizer), crop/seeding cultivation cover, feedstock for feed, bedding/padding materials (livestock/poultry barn, storehouse), and biomass fuel. Taking an example for the valorization of rice husk, it showed that about 123 thousand metric tons was reused as an auxiliary fuel in 2022, which was obviously higher than that (about 78 thousand metric tons) in 2018 (MOA, 2023 ). In this regard, the valorization trends of food-derived waste shift to more economically valuable directions like waste-to-energy and waste-to-biomaterial (Maina et al., 2017 ; Tsai et al., 2021b , 2022 , 2023 ). On the other hand, the valorization options of food-derived waste from industry/commerce-related enterprises were closely associated with the regulatory reuse requirements under the authorization of the Waste Management Act. Basically, the reuse (valorization) amounts for each food-derived waste must be in accordance with the specified types under the authorizations of the Waste Management Act and the Renewable Energy Development Act. They will be also elaborated in Section 5 . The relevant regulation and new value-added approaches in food-derived waste valorization will be also elaborated in Section 5  and Section 6 , respectively.   3 Status of GHG emissions from the waste management in Taiwan According to the “2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines”  (IPCC, 2006 ), the generation sources of GHG (i.e., CO2 , CH4  and N2 O) from the waste sector included solid waste disposal (encoded as 4A), biological treatment of solid waste (encoded as 4B), incineration and open burning of waste (encoded as 4C), and wastewater treatment and discharge (encoded as 4D). It should be noted that the emissions of CO2  from food-derived waste (exclusive of non-biological residues like plastic materials for food package) in the waste sector will be not included as a reporting item due to the biogenic carbon cycle without a burden on atmospheric CO2 . Therefore, the most significant GHG from the treatment and disposal of municipal, industrial and other solid waste will be methane (CH4 ), which is mainly generated as a result of degradation of organic material derived from biomass sources (e.g., crop/vegetable/fruit residues) under anaerobic conditions. On the other hand, nitrous oxide (N2 O), another potent GHG, will be mainly derived from degradation of animal-based sources containing proteins and protein-like materials (e.g., livestock/poultry/fish residues) under anaerobic conditions. In many industrialized countries, waste management has changed to waste recycling/reuse and incineration policies in the past two decades, thus reducing the amount of waste generated. The alternative waste management method was to dispose of sanitary landfill where the landfill gas-to-power has become more common as a measure to reduce the environmental impacts of CH4  emissions. Regarding the biological treatment of solid waste, it mainly referred to composting and anaerobic digestion of organic waste (e.g., kitchen waste, garden/yard/park waste and biological sludge). Although the eco-friendly practices also emit less amounts GHG (i.e., CO2 , CH4  and N2 O), it has economic benefits of the production of organic fertilizers, soil amendment, and biogas for energy use. In addition, the emissions from MSW and industrial waste incineration facilities without energy recovery are reported in the waste sector. Over the past three decades (1991–2021), the Taiwan government has established the national GHG inventories in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (MOE, 2023b ). Taiwan's total GHG emissions (excluding land use, land use change and forestry) had slightly increased by 297,007 × 103  metric tons CO2eq  from 286,962 × 103  metric tons CO2eq  in 2010–2021 (MOE, 2023b ), accounting for about 0.8% of global GHG emissions (GCDL, 2023 ). Concerning the GHG emissions from the food-derived waste management in Taiwan, Table 2   showed Taiwan's GHG (CO2 /CH4 /N2 O) emissions from the four categories within the waste sector. Based on the data in Table 2  (MOE, 2023b ), the significant variations and relevant features were addressed to echo the GHG emissions from the food-related waste management in Taiwan.- The waste sector is usually the least important sector in GHG emission inventories, typically accounting for 3–5% of total GHG emissions in most countries (Ilmas, Mir, & Khalid, 2018 ). In Taiwan, the total GHG emissions from the sector was slightly decreased from 4423 × 103  metric tons CO2eq  in 2010 to 2679 × 103  metric tons CO2eq  in 2021 (MOE, 2023b ). As listed in Table 2 , this declining trend could be due to the official waste management hierarchy by the priority order of source reduction & reuse, recycling/composting, energy recovery (via incineration), and disposal. In Taiwan, MSW and general industrial waste have been almost treated by incineration, causing the less GHG emissions from sanitary landfills continuously. As compared to total GHG emissions in 2021 (i.e., 297,007 × 103  metric tons based on CO2eq ), the contribution percentage of waste sector was only 0.9%, which was significantly lower than the levels of other countries like USA (US EPA., 2023 ) and Japan (CGER, 2021 ).  - Among the waste sector's emissions in 2021, GHG emissions from the category 4D “wastewater treatment and discharge” accounted for 58.84%, followed by GHG emissions from the category 4A “solid waste disposal" by 20.30%, GHG emissions from the category 4C “waste incineration and opening burning” by 18.99%, and GHG emissions from the category 4B “waste biological disposal“ by 1.87%, as shown in Table 2 . In addition, GHG emissions from the category 4A indicated a significant decrease from 2601 × 103  metric tons CO2eq  in 2010 to 544 × 103  metric tons CO2eq  in 2021. However, GHG emissions from the category 4C indicated a rapid increase during the period of 2019–2021. This result was attributed to the increasing establishments of small and medium-sized waste incinerators without energy recovery in recent years, resulting in the significant increase in CO2  emissions (seen in Table 2 ). On the other hand, the regulatory and incentive promotion for composting and anaerobic digestion of kitchen waste during this period also caused the slight increase in GHG emissions from the category 4C (Tsai, 2020 ; Tsai & Lin, 2021a ).  - As shown in Table 2 , the contribution of CH4  accounted for 65–90% of GHG emissions from the waste sector since 2010. The ratios of CH4  emission to GHG (CO2 , CH4  and N2 O) emissions decreased from 88.5% in 2012 to 67.5% in 2021 because of Taiwan's waste management hierarchy by reducing waste at the source, reuse & recycling, and energy recovery by biogas-to-power (in the anaerobic digestion facilities). As mentioned above, the contribution of CO2  thus showed an increasing trend in recent years.     4 Taiwan's sustainable development goals with relevance to food-derived waste management On December 25, 2015, the United Nations (UN) announced the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to provide a target-oriented roadmap for all countries or regions by 2030 (UN, 2023 ). The main highlights of UN's SDGs aim at ending poverty and hunger (SDG-1, SDG-2), improving health and education (SDG-3, SDG-4), reducing inequality (SDG-5, SDG-10), providing clean water environment (SDG-6, SDG-14), spurring clean energy and economic growth (SDG-7, SDG-8), building sustainable infrastructure and society (SDG-9, SDG-11), conserving natural and environmental resources (SDG-12, SDG-15) and taking actions on climate change and environmental rights altogether (SDG-13, SDG-16, SDG-17). In this regard, food-derived waste valorization are great concerns and directly related to SDG-12 (i.e., responsible consumption and production by recycling discarded materials and residues for promoting circular economy and zero waste), SDG-7 (i.e., affordable and clean energy by using high energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy like biogas-to-power using anaerobic digestion process) and SDG-2 (i.e., zero hunger by wasting less food and supporting local farmers like organic fertilizers from food-derived waste valorization) (Mensi & Udenigwe, 2021 ). In addition, we need to have food loss and waste (FLW) management procedures and actions (Facchini et al., 2023 ; Hoehn et al., 2022 ; Salihoglu et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ), focusing on the sustainability of our food supply chain systems and the transformation of daily lifestyle for each people's perception (Al-Obadi et al., 2022 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ). Obviously, the relationships between SDGs and FLW are all interconnected and closely related to the environmental protection, agricultural production and energy supply. In response to the UN SDGs and major international environmental issues, some countries have taken certain strategies, policies or laws for reducing FLW (Shen et al., 2023 ). In recent years, fighting FLW by law and/or policy has been promulgated by few Asian countries and other developed countries (Eriksson et al., 2020 ; Feng et al., 2022 ; Joshi & Visvanathan, 2019 ; Walia & Sanders, 2019). Joshi and Visvanathan (2019)  surveyed the food waste management legislations and technological & policy drivers in the selected Asian countries (i.e., Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Thailand, China, and South Korea), which have committed to SDG-12 that deals with food waste reduction and food supply chain. Walia & Sanders (2019) reviewed the scale of food waste in the USA, and also discussed recent policy and private actions on curbing food waste or applying food waste toward hunger alleviation, biofuel production and soil nourishment. Eriksson et al. (2020)  examined the existing European Union (EU) frameworks and legislations that are linked directly or indirectly to food waste. In this regard, the EU Action Plan for a Circular Economy of 2015, ratified by each Member State (MS) as part of the 2030 SDGs, aimed at halving food waste, while reducing food losses along production and supply chains. Recently, the Anti-food Waste Law of the People's Republic of China was enacted in April 2021 to guarantee food security, conserve resources, and protect the environment (Feng et al., 2022 ). To be in line with the UN SDGs, the Taiwan government also decided to take declarations and actions by the National Council for Sustainable Development (NCSD), which is one of the mission-oriented official councils under the Executive Yuan. In 2019, the Taiwan's SDGs was officially announced to total 18 goals, 143 targets, and 336 indicators. On Dec. 29, 2022, it was further revised to meet the national policies (NCSD, 2022 ), including nuclear-free homeland and net-zero emissions by 2050 (NDC, 2022 ). Connecting with food-derived waste management issues, the most relevant SDGs should be “Goal 12: Promote Green Economy and Ensure sustainable consumption & production pattern”, which involves the Target 12.3, Target 12.4, Target 12.5 and Target 12.8. Table 3   furthermore summarized the corresponding indicators and their specific goals by 2025 and 2030 in Taiwan.  5 Regulatory promotion for food-derived waste valorization in Taiwan As mentioned above, the driving forces for converting food waste into the value-added products could be based on the multiple considerations, including environmental protection, energy production, economic benefit, climate change (greenhouse gas emission) mitigation, and food supply. Due to the chemical and biological characteristics of food waste and its available valorization for the production of chemicals, materials, and biofuels, the central governing authorities in Taiwan jointly promulgated the regulatory promotions for turning biological residues into value-added resources under the Waste Management Act in recent years (Tsai, 2018 ; Tsai, 2019a ; Tsai, 2019b ; Tsai, 2020 ; Tsai, 2021a ). Table 4   summarized the regulatory measures for the valorization (or reuse) options of biological residues from the industrial and agricultural enterprises under the authorization of Article 39 of the Waste Management Act (WMA). The provision referred to the reuse (valorization) of industrial waste as raw material, materials, or fuel, which shall be stipulated by the central industry competent authorities or central competent authority. The regulatory measures for promoting food-related waste valorization in Taiwan were further addressed as follows. 5.1 Ministry of Environment In response to the international trend towards net-zero emissions and other global environmental changes, the Ministry of Environment (MOE) was officially changed from the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) on August 22, 2023. In addition, the MOE will focus on implementing a circular and low-carbon society via circular economy, waste reduction & reuse, energy from waste (waste-to-energy), green procurement, and sustainable consumption & production. As mentioned above, the significant decrease in pig feed could be attributed to the “food safety scandal” event in 2014 and the prevention of African swine fever (ASF) spread since 2019 (Tsai, 2021a ). By contrast, the reuse of food waste via composting and other options (e.g., waste-to-biogas/power) indicated an increasing trend due to the regulatory promotion of organic farming and renewable electricity, which will be addressed in the subsections. Under the authorization of the WMA, the MOE promulgated some regulatory measures for promoting the reuse (valorization) of food (kitchen) waste and waste cooking oil from all sources to prevent the food contamination and/or enter the food chain. By adding the provisions to the related regulation in on November 3, 2017 (MOJ, 2023), the Taiwan government is currently providing financial support to establish anaerobic digestion plants for turning food (kitchen) waste into organic fertilizers and biogas-to-electricity (Tsai, 2018 , 2019b ). The food waste-to-energy policy not only generates the green power from biological residues, but also upgrades the energy efficiencies of larger-scale municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plants (Tsai, 2016 ). Concerning the valorization of waste cooking oil (Tsai, 2019a ), the mandatory recycling of WCO from residential and commercial sectors was established to produce biodiesel and auxiliary fuel as renewable energy. However, the domestic use of WCO-derived biodiesel was terminated due to Diesel-fueled vehicle safety (e.g., ignition delay) and exhaust emissions at higher levels since 2015. As listed in Table 4 , other permissible WCO reuse options included the feedstock for manufacturing soap, stearic acid, fatty acid methyl ester (blending with fuel oil), or renewable (biomass) fuel. However, the reuse of regenerated WCO as an additive in animal feeds was banned to prevent it from entering the food chain and affecting human health. It can be concluded that the food-related waste (i.e., kitchen waste and WCO) valorization was preferably adopted by the waste-to-energy options via anaerobic digestion in the biogas production facilities and/or cogeneration in the MSW incineration plants (Lai et al., 2009 ).  5.2 Ministry of Agriculture Under the authorization by the Article 39 of the WMA, Table 4  listed the types of food-derived waste and reuse (valorization) options, which were announced by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). Noticeably, the MOE was transformed from the Council of Agriculture (COA) on August 1, 2023 in response to the complex affairs of agricultural production for food security and agricultural resources for climate change mitigation. The food-related residues from agricultural production enterprises mainly included waste oyster shell, fruit & vegetable residues, pig hair, livestock & poultry slaughtering scraps, dead livestock & poultry, and broken eggs or hatching waste. Therefore, the MOE jointly promulgated some regulatory measures for ensuring the materials or bio-products from the food-derived waste valorization under the relevant acts like the Organic Agriculture Promotion Act, the Fertilizer Management Act, and the Feed Management Act. Under the authorization of the Feed Management Act, the MOA promulgated the limited standards of the homemade feed for aflatoxin, copper and zinc, depending on the types and ages of livestock (pig) and poultry (chicken, duck). Table 5   further listed the regulatory specifications of composts derived from food waste under the authorization of the Fertilizer Management Act, especially in the toxic elements of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). Under the financial supports and encouragements by the Organic Agriculture Promotion Act, these composts can be used as organic fertilizers for ensuring food security and also protecting soil resources in a sustainable agriculture (Schaub & Leonard, 1996 ; Tsai, 2012c ). Based on the food-derived waste valorization in Table 4 , they focused on the traditional reuse types, including feed, feedstock for feed and feedstock for organic fertilizer. Obviously, the economic or value-added benefits of these reusable options are not high when compared to those by producing biomaterials or biochemical from biological residues (Liu et al., 2023 ; Ramos et al., 2023 ). The resulting biomaterials or biochemicals can become the constituents or compositions of health-care products (e.g., collagen), nutrition supplements (e.g., biological carbon), cosmetics (e.g., skin-care), herbal medicines (e.g., cerenin), soil conditioners (e.g., biochar), carbon adsorbents (e.g., activated carbon), natural surfactants (i.e., soap), cleaning solvents (i.e., citrus oil), pharmaceutical drug s (e.g., salicylic acid) and so on (Berenguer et al., 2023 ; Caldeira et al., 2020 ; Ong et al., 2018 ; Sarkar et al., 2023 ; Scarano et al., 2022 ; Sharma et al., 2021 ).  5.3 Ministry of Economic Affairs As mentioned in Sec. 3.2, methane (CH4 ) emissions from solid waste disposal may be the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the waste sector (IPCC, 2006 ). CH4  and nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions from biological treatment (e.g., composting, anaerobic digestion) of solid waste are also important GHG sources. However, the waste-to-energy systems at sanitary landfills and anaerobic digestion biogas facilities were grouped into the energy sector according to the IPCC methodology (IPCC, 2006 ). Obviously, food waste is an excellent feedstock for producing flammable biogas and fermented by-products via anaerobic digestion process (Lytras et al., 2021 ; Pour & Makkawi, 2021 ). The former can be further purified by a desulfurization (H2 S removal) process and turbine engine to generate the renewable electricity. Although the production of biogas can be obtained from sanitary landfills, this MSW treatment method was not popular in the modern countries like Taiwan. In this regard, the Taiwan government announced the promotion policy for the production of bioenergy from food waste, manure and other crop/vegetable/fruit residues due to the legislation of the Renewable Energy Development Act (REDA) in 2009 (Lee & Tsai, 2020 , 2021 , 2022 ). The central competent authority (i.e., Ministry of Economic Affairs, so-called as MOEA), has twice revised the REDA in 2019 and 2023. Among the promotion measures in the REDA, the most important scheme is based on the feed-in tariff (FIT) rates for all renewable energy categories at fixed 20-year (Tsai, 2014 ), which was announced by the MOEA before the end of each year. In order to promote the installed capacity of biogas facilities under the considerations of environmental and energy benefits, it can be seen that there were two significant FIT rates, which were increased from 3.9211 NT$/kW-h (≒ 0.13 US$/kW-h) in 2016 to 5.1176 NT$/kW-h in 2017 and 5.1842 NT$/kW-h in 2022 to 7.0089 NT$/kW-h in 2023, respectively. According to the updated database (MOEA, 2023b ), total installed capacity of biogas-to-power facilities significantly increased from 8 MW (MW) in 2013 to 24 MW in 2023 (August). As mentioned above, the food-derived residues from industrial production enterprises mainly included sugarcane bagasse, sugar-filtrated mud, wine-brewing residues, food-processing sludge, wine-brewing sludge, plant-based residues, and animal-based residues. The priority is to reuse them as a biomass feedstock in the AD-biogas-to-power facility, an auxiliary fuel, feedstock for feed, or soil modifier. Herein, plant-based and animal-based residues refers to the biological residues from the production processes in the food manufacturing industries, which should be not treated by chemical methods and must not contain sludge from wastewater treatment. Taking the standpoint of the industry-energy competent authority (i.e., MOEA), the valorization of food-derived residues from non-residential sources (industry/commerce-related enterprises) put emphasis on the energy source for power generation (via anaerobic digestion) and auxiliary fuel (via direct combustion) because these biomass materials/residues can be considered as carbon-neutral fuels for supplying domestic energy use and mitigating GHG emissions (Dutta et al., 2021 ; Tsai 2012a , 2012b ; Zou et al., 2020 ). As mentioned above, the diversified energy was a critical issue that the domestic energy supply in Taiwan was highly dependent on imported energy (accounting for 97.27% in 2022) (MOEA, 2023a ).  5.4 Ministry of Finance In Taiwan, the tobacco & liquor industry may be operated by a government-owned enterprise (i.e., Taiwan Tobacco & Liquor Corp.) under the supervision of the National Treasury Administration (directly subordinate to the Ministry of Finance, MOF). Table 4  also listed the types of wine-brewing waste and reuse (valorization) options, which have been announced by the MOF under the authorization by the Article 39 of the WMA. As similar to the wine-brewing residues from the private wine-brewing enterprises, they included wine-brewing residues (i.e., waste distiller's grains, wine lees, alcoholic mash) and wine-brewing sludge. Their reuse (valorization) options are identical to those announced by the MOEA (i.e., feedstock for organic fertilizer, organic cultivation medium, or biomass energy).   6 New approaches in food-derived waste valorizations: case studies in Taiwan Since 2016, the Taiwan government is building on the foundations of the “5 + 2 Innovative Industries” Program, covering intelligent machinery, Asia Silicon Valley (including semiconductor manufacturing and Internet of Things - IoT), green energy, biomedicine (or biotechnology and medicine), national defense, along with new agriculture and the circular economy. Meanwhile, this innovation industry policy also forged a new model for sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030, which were in closely relevant to the SDG-2 (Zero hunger), SDG-7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG-12 (Sustainable consumption and production). Concerning the circular economy strategies, the central competent authorities (i.e., MOEA, MOA and MOE) jointly focused on food waste valorization for establishing new materials and energy industries from natural resources like lignocellulosic biomass and bio-mineral resources. In this regard, the new approaches in food-derived waste valorization have been successfully developed as the business models in Taiwan, which were also in connection with the government initiatives for “Taiwan's Pathway to Net-Zero Emissions in 2050”. 6.1 Biogas-to-power: valorizing biomass residues from wine-brewing and juice-manufacturing factories via anaerobic digestion and gas-turbine engine In 2019, one state-owned enterprise jointly ventured with a steel-manufacturing company to establish a new biogas-to-power model plant (TSC, 2024a ), which was dedicated to the conversion of biomass residues from wine-brewing (i.e., sorghum wine, rice wine) and juice-manufacturing (e.g., lemon juice, orange juice) factories to biogas and electricity via anaerobic digestion and gas-turbine engine. Under the considerations of carbon footprint and transportation costs, this plant was located in an industrial park (Neipu Township, Pingtung County, Taiwan), where it contained most of the generation sources of lignocellulosic residues, including distillers' grains (lees), fruit pomace (bregs) and spent activated sludge from wine-brewing plants. Fig. 1   simply depicted the flowsheet of the biogas-to-power plant, which was designed to achieve the treatment capacity of 36,000 metric tons/year, installed capacity of 720 kW, power generation (estimated) of 560 GW-hour/year, fermented liquor generation of 20,000 metric tons/year, and fermented residue generation of 1000 metric tons/year. Obviously, this case study was closely related to the SDG-2 and SDG-12 by the production of organic fertilizers and biogas-to-power, respectively.  6.2 Biomass-to-biomaterial: converting calcite-based residue into calcium oxide In Taiwan, there has been consistent efforts to recycle by-products of aquaculture farming in order to accomplish a sustainable society through resources recycling and bio-circular economy principles. This outer shell accounted for approximately 90% of an entire oyster/clam in a mass ratio, thus generating a significant amount of bio-mineral residue. More interestingly, it is composed of calcium carbonate with more than 90% of calcium carbonate and less amounts of magnesium carbonate and calcium sulfate as minor components (Tsai, 2013 ). In this regard, there was a Taiwan company built in 2020, which can treat about 50,000 metric tons of discarded oyster shell for producing 40,000 metric tons of organic fertilizer with high content of calcium carbonate. To upgrade the added value of the resulting fertilizer (calcium carbonate), the calcination at high temperature (>800 °C) was applied to generate another product (calcium oxide), which had a variety of industrial, agricultural and nutritional applications. It should be noted that carbon dioxide (CO2 ) gas was evolved from oyster shell/clam shell when calcinating at above 750 °C under the inert (oxygen-deficiency) atmosphere. Meanwhile, the carbonized char (biochar) produced from lignocellulosic biomass will be further activated by the released CO2  as gasification gas to form activated carbon. As shown in Fig. 2  , an innovation one-pot process has been successfully developed by the authors to produce high-porosity activated carbon and high-purity calcium oxide simultaneously. In this regard, the innovation process was relevant to the SDG-9.  6.3 Biomass-to-material: utilizing water caltrop husk for carbon materials (biochar & activated carbon) Water caltrop (Trapa natans ) is an aquatic floating plant commonly cultured in southern Taiwan. In Taiwan, the Guantian district (Taiwan city, Taiwan) is the main farming area of water caltrop, accounting for 90% of output. The pulp within the water caltrop is a starch-rich food, which can be eaten directly, or processed into powder product. Before eating it, however, the outer layer of water caltrop is stripped off, thus generating large amounts of water caltrop husk (WCH). This biomass residue was often buried in farmlands, burned in the open fields, or directly reused it as an organic fertilizer after shredding. Obviously, these low value-added approaches were not environment-friendly, posing the emissions of GHG and other air pollutants. To solve WCH-derived problems in a circular economy way, one startup company started to turn WCH into high quality biochar, which met the standards of international organizations like European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and International Biochar Initiative (IBI). The resulting biochar product has been registered as a new brand (“Guantian Black Gold”) in the market. In recent years, the researchers in the universities further studied the chemical/physical activation of WCH-based biochar for producing activated carbon products with high pore properties (Hsu et al., 2020 ; Lin et al., 2022 ; Lin & Tsai, 2021 ), which were used to act them as supercapacitors, liquid-phase adsorbents, and electrode materials. Concerning the novel applications of WCH-derived carbon materials, the case study can be confined within the scope of SDG-9.  6.4 Biomass-to-biomaterial: reusing fish scale as the precursor for producing collagen protein Collagen may be the most essential extracellular protein in animal's body (especially in vertebrates), providing the mechanical protection in the connective tissues and various organs. Due to its increasing applications in various fields (e.g., medicine, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, health care, leather, and so on), this biomaterial has become an important product around the world. In addition, collagen protein is a starting feedstock for manufacturing gelatins, which can be further processed to produce food products or food additives like gel, emulsifier, thickening agent and stabilizer. Industrially, collagen is often obtained from mammalian sources like pig skin and cattle bone. However, its extensive applications could be limited because of high cost and allergic reactions. Based on the sustainable valorization of aquatic by-products, fish-processing residues and sea food waste have been reused to produce collagen in recent years (Oliveira et al., 2021 ; Subhan et al., 2021 ). In Taiwan, one biotechnology enterprise had extracted 100% collagen protein from the milkfish (Chanos chanos , one of the most commonly consumed fish in Taiwan) scales (TSC, 2024b ), transforming discarded waste into high value-added products (i.e., beauty jelly, or cosmetics). Applying the proprietary technique to the production of collagen protein from fishery residues, the novelty of the collagen-based product was to highlight the advantages without fishy smell. Meanwhile, the nutritional and functional components were retained in the skin-care product. The case study involved the production of health-care product in connection with the SDG-3.   7 Conclusions and future perspectives Currently, the food supply chain accounted for a third of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture, forestry & land use (AFLU), and waste sectors. Therefore, the developments of circular economy and sustainable consumption for food-derived waste management become more and more important. In Taiwan, the waste sector currently shared about 1.0% of total GHG emissions, but the amounts of food-derived waste (excluding livestock/poultry manures and non-biological food-derived residues) accounted for around 3.0 million metric tons. Based on the bio-refinery concepts, the Taiwan government promulgated the regulatory promotion for the food-derived waste valorization by designating it as a mandatory recyclable resource under the authorization of the Waste Management Act (WMA). As a consequence, the contribution percentages of GHG emissions from the waste sector indicated a decreasing trend over the past two decades, reaching only about 0.9% in 2021. In addition, the government also declared the corresponding SDG indicators for connecting with the food loss & waste (FLW) management and valorization, including SDG-2 (i.e., zero hunger like fertilizer supply by food-derived waste valorization), SDG-7 (i.e., affordable & clean energy like biogas-to-power) and SDG-12 (i.e., responsible consumption & production like FLW promotion). These relevant indicators included the waste rate of food in supply-side (vegetables and fruits), loss percentage during food processing, quantity of food (kitchen) waste generated by supermarkets and retailing warehouses, industrial waste reuse (valorization) rate, regional recycling rate of energy and materials, target area for eco-friendly and organic cultivation, and recycling and reuse of waste of the animal (pig-raising) industry. Furthermore, four new case studies in food-derived waste valorization for producing value-added products have been successfully developed as the business models in Taiwan. In order to spur the development of bio-refinery, the Taiwan government is implementing the relevant policies for triggering the domestic/international markets in the near future, which combined with the circular economy for advanced materials, biotechnologies for health-care & biomedicine, and green energy for biofuels and power generation. These policies, including financial tools by green finance measures and regulatory tools by the Climate Change Response Act, must be in step with “Taiwan's Pathway to Net-Zero Emissions in 2050”. Under the resource recycling & zero waste performed as one of key strategies, it will be expected that the amounts of food-derived waste from the residential and non-residential sources and its corresponding GHG emissions will be further reduced. Furthermore, the production of value-added products from food-derived waste and their economic outputs will create a roadmap towards a circular bio-economy and sustainable society. More importantly, the people must recognize the perceptions of environmental consciousness and take actions on daily eco-friendly behaviors, which may be the main axis of food loss and waste management. In this regard, the challenges of food-derived waste reduction and valorization may be mainly dependent on the “social transition” and “lifestyle transition”, as well as the “technology innovation” and “climate-related legislation”.
