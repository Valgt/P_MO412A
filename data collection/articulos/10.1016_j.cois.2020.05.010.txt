                  Termites are amongst the main macroinvertebrate decomposers in tropical ecosystems and they exert additional impacts through the creation of biostructures (mounds, galleries, sheetings, etc.) with different soil physical and chemical properties, thereby impacting positively on numerous ecosystem services for humankind. Unfortunately, this positive or ‘bright’ role of termites is often overshadowed by their ‘dark’ side, that is, their status as pests threatening agriculture and constructions. This article assesses advances in our knowledge of the impact of termites on several sustainable development goals (SDGs 1 ‘no poverty’, 2 ‘zero hunger’, 3 ‘good health’, 9 ‘innovation’, 11 ‘sustainable cities’, 13 ‘climate action’ and 15 ‘life on land’). Finally, using the Indian myth of Valmiki as a parable, we illustrate that a reconciliation between the termite's dark and bright sides is needed if we want to reduce our dramatic impact on biodiversity and more generally achieve SDGs.

Figure 3   Figure 4 Schematic representation of the impact of termites on SDGs. Termite ‘machinery’ depends upon carbon energy coming from the soil (e.g. humus) or plants (i.e. residues and/or living parts). This consumption is essential for termites to provide multiple ecosystem services. Their impacts are related to their role in the food web (e.g. their consumption by animals and their impact on the cycling of nutrients) and to bioturbation (e.g. the formation of mounds and soil pores), which all positively influence numerous SDGs. However, C consumption by termites is also necessarily associated with disservices, such as reductions in yield or C stocks in the soil.

All rights reserved.      Introduction Pests are animals that harm and destroy crops and forest products. In the imagination of most of the population (including scientists, farmers and stakeholders), many insects fall into this category because of their ability to feed on decayed and living plant tissues. Pest management practices have therefore flourished in order to control or eradicate them from our plantations and/or habitations [1 ]. This ‘dark’ side of insects is the subject of an exponentially growing body of literature that emerged in the 1990s. At the same time and in parallel with this school of thought, scientific literature is increasingly focusing on the importance of insects and their numerous threats on the numerous ecosystem services (ES) that they provide to humanity [2 ,3 ]. This ‘bright’ side of insects has been particularly evidenced by their role in pollination, although their impacts on the control of pests, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration are increasing in popularity. Termites are an interesting example of our dualistic appreciation of insect diversity. The dark side of termites is evidenced by an exponentially growing body of scientific studies aiming to control or eradicate them (Figure 1  ). Indeed, termite impacts can be very important in some situations and numerous articles reveal how termites can reduce the yield of many agricultural crops and forest products [4–7 ]. Therefore, to many, termites need to be eradicated to enable us to achieve our sustainable development goals (SDG) (e.g. providing food for humans and domestic animals, and reducing poverty by increasing farmers’ incomes). On the other hand, the bright side of termites is evidenced by scientific literature focusing on their role as ecosystem engineers or associated with the concept of sustainability. Although the ecological impact of termites was the subject of many works prior to the development of this concept [8 ], the concept of ‘ecosystem engineering’ continues to help underline the key role played by termites in modifying soil properties, landscape structure and the habitats of subordinate organisms [9 ]. Moreover, since termite biodiversity and activity are threatened by intensive agricultural practices, such as the conversion of natural forests to mono-plantations (e.g. [10 ,11 ]), their ecological impacts have mainly been evidenced in ‘more natural’ or protected environments. Therefore, it appears that ecologists and soil scientists have mainly focused on the beneficial impacts of termites in natural environments, without any apparent connection to their contribution to SDGs, while agronomists have mainly considered their role as pests in cultivated areas [5 ,12 ]. These two aspects constitute the framework of the present article. We argue that the time has come to unify these perceptions of termites in order to define new and more holistic appreciations of our cohabitation with termites and see the degree to which we can take advantage of their ecological impact to achieve SDGs [13 ].  Dilemma between harmful versus beneficial impacts Web of Science revealed 132 outputs with the key words ‘termite’ and either ‘sustainable’ or ‘sustainability’ but among the outputs, only 71 were identified as research articles (see the list in the complementary file). Moreover, of these 71 outputs, 31% were published in the last two years (from 2017 onward), showing how recent this field of investigation is. The bibliometric map of these 71 articles shows that a large proportion addresses the pest status of termites (46%), which impacts SDGs 1 and 2 (no poverty and zero hunger) and 3 (good health and well-being) (Figure 2  ). Harmful impacts are associated with the consumption of lignocellulosic materials, reductions in crop yield and a degradation of constructions, leading to significant economic losses [4 ,5 ,12 ,14 ,15 ]. Although highly variable and context dependent, the rule seems to be that termite impacts are most important when plants are in the early stage of growth, during drought or under other stresses [12 ,16••  ]. A second more dispersed cluster appears in Figure 2  around the beneficial impacts of termites. Beneficial impacts are associated with their significant role on soil functioning in tropical environments. From this viewpoint, termite foraging and construction activities are associated with the construction of galleries that increase water infiltration and soil fertility [16••  ,17 ,18••  ] and the production of mounds that can be used for growing vegetables, harvesting mushrooms or used as amendments to increase soil fertility [19••  ,20 ,21•  ,22–24 ]. In India, termite mound soil is also used in mixtures with organic residues to accelerate the production of compost and increase its quality, while it is used in small gaps to retain water and improve the soil moisture content profile in the ‘Zai’ system in northern Burkina Faso [16••  ]. Termite mounds are also considered accurate predictors of the presence of precious metals, such as gold, or the proximity of water sources in deeper soil layers [25•  ]. Although rarely considered, termites can also increase farmers’ incomes, health and food security [19••  ]. In India, termite swarming is used by farmers in weather forecasting [26 ]. The use of termites as food source is ancient [27 ] and explained by their great nutritional values for animals, including humans [19••  ,21•  ,26 ,28 ]. Termites are also used in traditional popular medicine [28–31 ]. Medicinal plants growing on termite mounds are used by local populations to cure several diseases [20 ,32 ]. Termite mound soil can also be used as a medicine [31 ,33 ] and its consumption has been described in various African ethnic groups [21•  ,31 ,34 ]. This practice is generally considered as an adaptive advantage with therapeutic values for self-medication and it has been reported to be common among pregnant women, although non-pregnant women may also consume termite mound clays whenever they feel weak [21•  ]. This consumption is explained by the enrichment of clay and salts (e.g. Ca and Mg) in termite mound soils that act as adsorbents of harmful bacteria and toxins such as alkaloids in plant foods. Finally, along with their consumption, termites are also sold as food and generate an income, thus contributing the whole economy of villages [35 ]. For instance, Macrotermes  spp. are commonly consumed by villagers in Africa where their sale can lead to a significant income [21•  ] while winged termites are collected by forest tribes and sold to local markets in South India [30 ]. Moreover, the harvesting, preparation and selling of termites are dominated by women and children in Zimbabwe who earn independent incomes, thus tackling the gender-equality issue [29 ]. Termites are also part of food webs and contribute to the diet of many terrestrial animals [4 ]. Some species might even be specialized termite feeders, such as aardwolves (Proteles cristatus ) in South Africa and the numbats (Myrmecobius fasciatus ) in Australia [36 ,37 ]. The specific soil properties of termite constructions also offer valuable habitats for microbes [22 ] and plants [38 ], as well as shelter to predators, such as ants and snakes [26 ], which could be useful for controlling insects and rats in plantations and farms. Another consequence of this resource patchiness is that vegetation growing on mounds can represent foraging hotspots for herbivores (e.g. elephants, black rhinos and giraffes). From these examples, it appears that termite abundance and diversity are crucial drivers of ecosystem functioning and therefore must be considered in any strategy of ecological management or restoration. Separate from all other topics in the bibliometric map shown in Figure 2  is all the research carried out on biotechnology and the study of the microbial properties within termite gut and termite mound soil [22 ,39 ,40 ]. Although at first glance the information gained from these studies is difficult to relate to SDGs, their outputs can be very practical and contribute to the emergence of new methods for the recycling of lignocellulosic substances, increasing the availability of phosphate in soil and the resistance of materials to natural degradation, and for curing diseases [7 ,41 ], in line with SDGs 3 and 9. Another interesting example is given by the utilization of termite mound soils for construction. The specific mechanical properties of termite mound soils make them interesting materials for construction and mixing this material with cement offers appropriate strength and plastic properties [4 ,22 ,33 ,42 ]. These characteristics are considered to be especially useful for low-income and medium-income earners in Africa. The shape and structure of termite mounds have also been very inspiring since termites are able to control the temperature and humidity within their mound nests by adapting their architecture to the environment. The mechanisms of this thermoregulation have long been described [43 ], and the nests remain cited as an example of biomimetic architecture for reducing the consumption of energy in buildings [44 ], thus contributing to SDG 11. Finally, the collective behaviour of termites has also been used as an inspired model for the creation of multi-agent construction robots that use just a few simple rules and environmental cues to build castle-like structures and pyramids.  Beyond sustainable development goals Although poorly or not taken into account in SDGs, termites can also play an important spiritual role. The close interaction between termite mounds and humans is evidenced by the very specific attention that rural populations pay to termite mounds. In Benin, ethnic groups use termite mounds in traditional rituals to drive out evil spirits and attract fortunes and for the scarification of children during the return ceremonies of their father's maternal family [4 ]. From South-East Asia to West Africa, mounds are commonly worshiped or protected by the population on the basis of spiritual beliefs. They have been the home of ancestors since the Iron Age [45 ] and are seen as entrances to the netherworld and sources of fertility [46••  ]. Termite mounds can host spirits in Thailand. Abandoned termite mounds can be occupied by animals that are worshiped in India (Figure 3  ), such as snakes which are associated with Shiva, one of the most important gods in Hinduism, or Nagesvara, the lord of the Naga demons or primordial snake, which is a personification of the cosmic dichotomy of being beneficent in representing fecundity and malevolent in threatening destruction and a return to chaos [45 ]. Another interesting spiritual role of termites is found in the story of Valmiki, who was previously a robber, a hunter and a murderer named Ratnakara. Later, Ratnakara met an important vedic sage, Narada Muni, who taught him meditation. After years of meditation, termites built their nest on Ratnakara, who was then buried alive, becoming Valmiki, the one born in a termite hill [46••  ]. Finally, Valmiki wrote the Ramayana, which is also one of the most important stories in Hinduism. One lesson that we can learn from this story is that termites, through their activities, are able to produce the best (i.e. the writing of the Ramayana or the provision of ES) from the worst (i.e. the crime or their impact as pests). In other words, termites show us that the best and worst are intertwined.  Conclusion Does the harmful or dark side impact of termites prevail over their beneficial or bright side impact? The question remains open. In 1998, Mando and Van Rheenen [47 ] questioned whether termites have to be seen as enemies and/or friends, while in 2019, the French Academy of Agriculture questioned whether insects have to be considered ‘foes, friends or models’. If the bright and dark sides of termites have to be evaluated while designing and implementing suitable management strategies [48•  ], the parable of Valmiki reminds us that we also need the dark side of elements if we want their bright side. This complexity is perhaps never as well evidenced as in the article of Herrick et al.  [49 ], who used the example of termites positively impacting water infiltration but reducing C stocks in soil. This complexity is also summarized in Figure 4  , which shows the interdependence between the need for termites to feed on organic matter and their impacts on SDGs or, in other words, that one cannot be obtained without the other and that to get the bright, we have to accept the dark.
