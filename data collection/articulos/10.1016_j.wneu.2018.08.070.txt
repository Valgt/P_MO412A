                  Background
                  On September 25, 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a 17-goal action plan to transform the world by the year 2030, ushering in the Era of Sustainable Development. These Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were designed to continue where the preceding Millennium Development Goals left off, expanding on the Millennium Development Goal successes, and facing the challenges encountered during the previous decade and a half. The current Era of Sustainable Development and its impact on a breadth of neurosurgical concerns provide several unprecedented opportunities to enhance political prioritization of neurosurgical care equity. Neurosurgeons could therefore be well positioned to participate in the leadership of these global health development and policy reform efforts.
               
                  Methods
                  Each of the 17 SDGs was reviewed and analyzed for its relevance to the public health aspects of neurosurgery. The analysis was guided by a review of the literature performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the databases of the World Health Organization.
               
                  Results
                  Among the 17 SDGs, 14 were found to be of direct or indirect relevance to neurosurgeons and neurosurgical care delivery. Results of this analysis are presented and discussed, and recommendations are provided for using this knowledge to inform the emerging discipline of global neurosurgery.
               
                  Conclusions
                  This article contributes to the global neurosurgery movement by providing the socially and globally conscious neurosurgeon with a compass for directing the place of neurosurgery in the international agenda for sustainable development.

achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all Around the world, spinal injuries are a water-related disease, primarily caused by diving accidents. In some LMICs where long journeys on foot are often needed to obtain water, women and children may have chronic spinal deformity from the heavy weight of carried water, or from falls on unsafe or poorly lit paths made during twilight hours 53   6.2 By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations Development of neurosurgical capacity in LMICs will require adequate sanitation and hygiene as well as quality sources of water at health care facilities; 38% of these facilities currently lack a quality water source, 19% do not have improved sanitation and 35% lack water and soap for hand washing 54   7 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all  7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services Advocate for the energy resources required for emergency and essential surgical care, such as power for lighting, drills, cautery, etc. 55   8 Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all  8.5 By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value Neurosurgery is an indispensable component of health care that enables people with neurosurgical disorders, such as trauma to the head or spine, to return to full and productive employment 56-59   9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation  9.5 Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending Neurosurgical innovation will be critical to make essential neurosurgical care available to all who need it, wherever they may be 60,61   10 Reduce inequality within and among countries  10.4 Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies, and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, polices, and action in this regard The emerging field of global neurosurgery consists of sustained neurosurgical capacity-building initiatives that collectively aim to reduce inequalities of healthcare access around the world 62,63   11 Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable  11.5 By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations Access to safe, and timely neurosurgical care for disaster-related trauma, without catastrophic health care costs, is an important responsibility of neurosurgical health care equity 64-67   13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts  13.3 Improve education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning Neurosurgeons, as well as all other health professionals, have an important role to play in the care of, and advocacy for, patients of disorders linked to climate change; people from underserved communities around the world are disproportionately burdened by the effects of these environmental changes 68,69   16 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels  16.1 Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere Violence-related traumatic injuries of the head, brain, and spine often require neurosurgical care to prevent related death and disability 70,71   16.9 By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration Confirmation of legal identity at birth, and throughout patient hospitalization is a critical aspect of safe, quality health care for all providers, including neurosurgeons 72   17 Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development  17.17 Encourage and promote effective public, public-private, and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships Fulfillment of the role of neurosurgery in achieving the SDGs requires partnership across public and private institutions and foundations, as well as across organized neurosurgery. Recognizing the role of neurosurgery in local and global surgical ecosystems, the promotion of resource sharing and collaborations across political and diplomatic borders will further advance the contribution of global neurosurgery to the fulfillment of the SDGs 42     LMICs, low- and middle-income countries; SDG, Sustainable Development Goal.   Table 3 Global Neurosurgery: Recommendations for the Future of an Emerging Subspecialty    Domain 1: Study Domain 2: Practice   Obtain further training in social sciences and public health. This training can be accomplished through focused fellowship experiences that prioritize neurosurgery capacity building in LMICs, and/or through the pursuit of graduate degrees in public health, epidemiology, global health care economics, medical anthropology, or other related social sciences Learn the language of global surgery. This challenge includes understanding recent major movements in this specialized area of public health, including World Health Assembly resolution 68.15 and Decision Point 70.22, and the findings, frameworks and recommendations of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery and the Bogota Declaration on Global Neurosurgery41,79,85,86   Study the increasing bodies of literature on global surgery in general and global neurosurgery in particular Focus on neurosurgical education and capacity building around neurosurgical care delivery. This goal can be accomplished through volunteer efforts with education-focused initiatives such as many such opportunities offered through Foundation for International Education in Neurological Surgery, or by partnering with local health care leaders in LMICs to develop new training programs in LMICs of interest Introduce disruptive innovations that minimize cost and maximize access to quality neurosurgical expertise and care. Examples include telemedicine, mobile surgical platforms, and endoscopic innovations for treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus in LMICs7,87,88   Create synergy with other health care providers, and nonmedical professionals, to overcome barriers to safe, timely, affordable access to essential neurosurgical care. An example of this process could be partnering with local cardiac and radiology providers to innovate around stroke and neurovascular disease management      Domain 3: Research Domain 4: Advocacy   Strive to understand local neurosurgical epidemiology to drive contextually adapted models of neurosurgical practice in LMICs Study the social determinants of neurosurgical disease in all populations, and the diversity of neurosurgical disease trends that occur across different socioeconomic groups locally and abroad Use both qualitative and quantitative scientific methods to highlight areas of inequity, and to study the impact of innovative, enduring solutions for the various aspects neurosurgical inequity Partner with nonneurosurgical researchers to produce interdisciplinary team science Develop the case for emergency and essential neurosurgical care as a component of universal health coverage Highlight the social and economic costs of disparities in access to neurosurgical care Incentivize industry partners and entrepreneurs to develop durable, low-cost equipment and technologies that promote equitable access to neurosurgical care in LMICs Participate in local, national, regional, and global forums that shape policies that drive the health care ecosystems that serve patients with neurosurgical disorders    LMICs, low- and middle-income countries.

The current Era of Sustainable Development and its impact on a breadth of neurosurgical concerns provide several unprecedented opportunities to enhance political prioritization of neurosurgical care equity. Neurosurgeons could therefore be well positioned to participate in the leadership of these global health development and policy reform efforts.  Methods Each of the 17 SDGs was reviewed and analyzed for its relevance to the public health aspects of neurosurgery. The analysis was guided by a review of the literature performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the databases of the World Health Organization.  Results Among the 17 SDGs, 14 were found to be of direct or indirect relevance to neurosurgeons and neurosurgical care delivery. Results of this analysis are presented and discussed, and recommendations are provided for using this knowledge to inform the emerging discipline of global neurosurgery.  Conclusions This article contributes to the global neurosurgery movement by providing the socially and globally conscious neurosurgeon with a compass for directing the place of neurosurgery in the international agenda for sustainable development.

Despite this situation, the current Era of Sustainable Development and its impact on a breadth of neurosurgical concerns provide several unprecedented opportunities to enhance political prioritization of surgical care equity in general and neurosurgical care equity in particular.2,3   The term global neurosurgery is relatively recent in the parlance of academic neurosurgeons; it describes an emerging interdisciplinary field exploring the interface between neurosurgery and the SDGs and the impact of worldwide neurosurgical care inequities on social justice.4   Neurosurgeons, by engaging in the work of global neurosurgery, are well positioned to participate in the leadership of global health development and policy reform efforts. In this report, we review the SDGs that are particularly relevant for neurosurgical providers and patients who have neurosurgical conditions. Using the discussion of these neurosurgically important SDGs as a point of departure, we conclude with recommendations to guide the clinical, academic, and political endeavors of current and future leaders of global neurosurgery.  Methods Each of the 17 SDGs was reviewed and analyzed for its relevance to the public health aspects of neurosurgery. The analysis was guided by a review of the literature performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the databases of the World Health Organization (WHO).  Results Of the 17 SDGs, 14 were found to be of relevance to neurosurgeons and neurosurgical care delivery. Given the explicit health-related focus of SDG3, its specific targets were individually reviewed, and neurosurgical implications of relevant targets are presented in Table 1  . The other 13 SDGs and their evidence-based relevance to neurosurgery are presented in Table 2  . The ensuing discussion highlights the neurosurgery-related concerns identified in the course of this analysis. SDG3: Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote Well-Being for All at All Ages The principal goal for health is SDG3, which aims to “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages” and addresses 13 key target areas.1,73   The neurosurgical implications of SDG3 are systematically considered by reviewing 6 targets relevant to neurosurgical diseases (Table 1 ). Targets 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8, 3.b, and 3.c, are reviewed in detail. Target 3.2 aims to end preventable deaths of newborns and young children; in neonatal health, suboptimal systems for delivering perinatal health and nutrition have been linked to a burden of hydrocephalus and myelomeningocele requiring neurosurgical attention acutely to complement preventive public health measures to address these conditions. In addition, access to safe and timely cesarean sections in cases of obstructed labor reduce incidents of cerebral insult and possible lifelong neurologic disability and seizures.1,74   Target 3.4 aims to reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases: cancer, cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory illnesses; neurosurgical treatments that contribute to this target include endovascular and open surgical care for cerebrovascular diseases and resection and radiosurgical treatment of central nervous system tumors.1,3   This target is particularly relevant because incidence of cancer and cerebrovascular disease is increasing rapidly in every country. Furthermore, stroke in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) occurs on average 15 years younger than in the high-income countries counterparts and is many times more likely to be hemorrhagic (surgical). Target 3.6 calls for reducing by half the quantity of global deaths and trauma caused by road traffic accidents (RTAs) by 2020. Data from WHO indicate that only 28 countries, representing 449 million people (7% of the world's population), have adequate laws that address all 5 risk factors for RTA: speed, drunk-driving, helmets, seat-belts, and child restraints.75   Neurosurgeons play a vital role in achieving target 3.6 by providing timely access to the lifesaving care required to manage these injuries. Given the critical role in managing victims of RTAs, neurosurgeons can also powerfully advocate for public health and policy measures that reduce RTA-related morbidity and mortality. Motorcycle collisions (MCs) constitute an important category of RTA contributing to the global burden of neurosurgical disease. Head and neck trauma is the most common cause of mortality from MC.21   In addition to their role as care providers for victims of MC, neurosurgeons can play an effective political role by advocating for helmet-wearing policies that can reduce and prevent these injuries.18,22   The use of crash helmets to prevent MC-related injury was introduced by the late British neurosurgeon, Sir Hugh Cairns, in Oxford, England during World War II.19,20   Target 3.8 calls for universal access to quality essential health care services; in LMICs, where the limitations, or absence, of surgical capacity has been well described, neurosurgical contributions may include the development of a neurosurgical care delivery platform. Provision of universal health coverage with financial risk protection is essential so that safe and timely neurosurgical care may be provided to all people in need without driving them into financial devastation. This provision is also anchored in World Health Assembly resolution 68.15 (2015) on strengthening emergency and essential surgical care as a component of universal health coverage.76-79   Target 3.b highlights the necessity for availability of essential medicines for all. Included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines are medicines for anesthesia, pain and palliative care, anticonvulsants, antibiotics, chemotherapy, hormones and antihormones, anti-Parkinson drugs, blood substitutes, a wide variety of cardiovascular drugs including thrombolytic agents, and a variety of diagnostic agents, among many others. These agents are an indispensable component of both surgical and nonsurgical care for patients with neurosurgical diseases. Target 3.c specifically targets the need for increased health financing and the recruitment, development, training, and retention of the health workforce in developing countries. These needs are greatest in the least-developed countries and developing small island states. Using mapping strategies to determine the current neurosurgery capacity and workforce in LMICs, Punchak et al.80   found that 11/68 LMICs had no practicing neurosurgeons and that the average percentage of the population with access to neurosurgery within a 2-hour window was as low as 25.26% in sub-Saharan Africa, 29.64% in East Asia, and 93.3% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. These glaring north–south disparities underscore the need for a geographically diverse expansion of neurosurgical workforce capacity, which requires the financial and human resources that facilitate equitable neurosurgical training and care delivery for all people.41,42   Although the 13 targets for health of SDG3 have understandably been the principal focus of global health policy development and reform efforts, several other SDGs are indirectly or tangentially related to health and are either explicitly or implicitly relevant for neurosurgeons and other health care providers, thereby effectively expanding the number of health-related targets for sustainable development.2,73   Exploring this expanded spectrum of health-related SDGs offers an opportunity for the entire neurosurgical community to play a critical role in advancing the global agenda for sustainable development.2,73   As a point of departure, Table 2  lists several of the expanded health-related targets and offers a neurosurgical perspective on the relevance of these SDGs.73   These goals, such as SDG2, SDG5, SDG6, SDG7, SDG9, SDG11, and SDG17, as well as some of their neurosurgical implications, are described in the following sections. A list of neurosurgically relevant SDGs is provided in Table 2 .  SDG2: End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved Nutrition and Promote Sustainable Agriculture Target 2.2 of SDG2 calls for an end to all forms of malnutrition; this includes globally agreed objectives that aim to address sequelae of poor nutrition in young children, women of reproductive age, and elderly individuals. The role of nutrition in neurologic health and disease remains an active area of biomedical investigation and clinical practice. Nutrient deficiencies are often etiologically linked to several disorders that come to neurosurgical attention, such as neural tube defects in neonates and spinal disorders in geriatric populations such as osteoporosis and subacute combined degeneration.47,48   As providers caring for populations who are neurologically susceptible to the consequences of nutritional deficiency, neurosurgeons are important advocates for nutritional behaviors that prevent malnutrition and nutrition-related neurologic disorders, promote wound healing, and support healthy bone development that prevents neurosurgical disorders of the spine.46   However, SDG2 as a whole can be viewed more generally: a well-fed population is a healthier and more productive population. Removing a large herniated lumbar disc, for example, in a young breadwinner should ensure a prompt return to gainful productivity.  SDG5: Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls Gender equality and the empowerment of women are key priorities in the development of the neurosurgical workforce and in the entire surgical care delivery system, which includes operating theatre and ward nurses, anesthesiologists, and nurse anesthetists. Regarding workforce development concerns, it has been acknowledged that attracting and retaining female neurosurgical providers are vital to the long-term success of the field, particularly in light of projected shortages of neurosurgeons.81   Studies identifying and describing barriers to women considering careers in neurosurgery, such as lack of role models and inadequate leadership training, have increased awareness of these issues and have enabled progress in professional practices that address these inequities.82-84   From the standpoint of organized neurosurgery, issues around gender equality are an ongoing area of advocacy that concerns all neurosurgeons and on which the future of the field depends. From the standpoint of care delivery, intimate partner violence (IPV) affects as much as 30% of women globally, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common among victims of IPV.52   Moreover, IPV further complicates TBI risk factors among women who serve in the military.50   As a critical part of interdisciplinary teams that care for female victims of TBI, neurosurgeons are well positioned to powerfully advocate for legislative and policy changes that eliminate this source of injustice.50-52   With respect to SDG target 5.6, which ensures universal access to sexual and reproductive health, neurosurgeons provide treatments for neuroendocrine disorders that may interfere with healthy reproductive and sexual function, thus playing a role in ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health.23,24    SDG6: Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All The relevance of SDG6 for neurosurgeons is evident from the standpoint of the facilities and equipment needs of neurosurgeons. Quality sources of water are required for presurgical and perioperative hand washing, intraoperative irrigation needs, perioperative fluid requirements, and sanitation. As much as 38% of facilities in LMICs lack a quality water source, 19% have inadequate sanitation practices, and 35% lack water and soap for hand washing.53   In these areas, the development of neurosurgical capacity requires expansion of access to adequate and equitable sanitation, pollution control, and hygiene, all of which depend on availability and sustainable management of water.  SDG7: Affordable and Clean Energy Many of the district-level, and even higher, facilities in LMICs do not have access to reliable and sustainable energy 24 hours a day. Most neurosurgical procedures demand excellent lighting, electrocautery, suction, anesthesia machines, and so on, all of which require energy.55    SDG9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure Neurosurgical care, including operative care, preoperative and postoperative care, imaging, and rehabilitation, require a certain level of hospital facility infrastructure. If this infrastructure is lacking, adequate, timely, and safe neurosurgical care cannot take place.  SDG11: Sustainable Cities and Communities In LMICs, a large degree of neurosurgical operative care at district-hospital level is head injury, much of which is a result of violent crime. Creating sustainable cities and communities where crime is minimal, roads are safe, and laws are enforced will reduce the incidence of TBI.  SDG17: Strengthen the Means of Implementation and Revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development The fulfillment of the potential role of neurosurgery in achieving the SDGs requires partnership across public and private institutions and foundations, as well as across organized neurosurgery. These partnerships include collaborations across specialty-specific groups such as the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies, the Foundation for International Education in Neurological Surgery, and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, as well as with global health partners outside neurosurgery such as the Global Initiative for Children's Surgery, the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), global surgical, obstetric, anesthesia and trauma societies, and WHO. Recognizing the role of neurosurgery in local and global surgical ecosystems, the promotion of resource sharing and collaborations across political and diplomatic borders will further advance the contribution of global neurosurgery to the fulfillment of the SDGs.   Discussion As shown in Tables 1  and 2 , most SDGs are of direct or indirect relevance for neurosurgeons. Insofar as achievement of these ambitious goals requires neurosurgical partnership and collaboration, neurosurgery is uniquely positioned to cause a welcome shift in the global tide of social justice. Advocacy efforts built around this manner of SDG cross-referencing are vital to solidifying the worldwide political prioritization of systems that provide access to neurosurgical care.42,73   This evolution in the neurosurgeon's scope of practice calls for leadership beyond the limits of the operating room and into the global public health arena.42   Even as modern neurosurgery in the developed world is characterized by cutting-edge diagnostic and therapeutic advances in areas of great epidemiologic importance, the translation of these technologies into global neurosurgery creates opportunities to fulfill the SDGs and generate health equity for impoverished surgically neglected populations worldwide. Although neurosurgeons have been active in international humanitarian neurosurgery for decades, at the time of writing this article, a PubMed search for the term “global neurosurgery” produced only 25 items (Figure 1  ). Most of these reports have appeared only in the past 2 years, highlighting the active emergence of an interdisciplinary field borne from the intersection of clinical neurosurgery and global public health. Park et al.42   provide a working definition of contemporary global neurosurgery. Paraphrasing Dare et al., these investigators characterize the field as an area of “…study, research, practice, and advocacy that places priority on improving health outcomes and achieving health equity for all people worldwide who are affected by neurosurgical conditions or have a need for neurosurgical care.”42   An in-depth understanding of the SDGs reviewed in this report can inform the development and practice of global neurosurgery with important socioeconomic priorities that have been embraced by the international community and are a key focus of major funders of human development projects, such as the World Bank, the Gates Foundation, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Using this discussion as a point of departure, we conclude with recommendations of several possible courses of professional action for upcoming leaders in the global neurosurgery space. These recommendations, provided in Table 3   and organized by the 4 domains of contemporary global neurosurgery, provide a roadmap to follow that will shape the evolution of this nascent field.  Conclusions This article contributes to the global neurosurgery movement by providing the socially and globally conscious neurosurgeon with a compass to direct their understanding of how neurosurgery fits into the international agenda for sustainable development. The analytic review of SDGs contained herein will strengthen the reader's understanding of key issues in contemporary global neurosurgery. Moreover, the recommendations provided offer an SDG-informed action plan for the future of an effective emerging subdiscipline at the intersection of neurosurgery and global public health.
