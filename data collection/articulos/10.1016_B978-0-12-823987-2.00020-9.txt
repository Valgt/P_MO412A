               This study aims to find out how businesses contributed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the early years after the declaration of these Goals at the end of 2015. Samples were taken from Indonesian publicly listed companies that published sustainability reports during the period 2016–2018 after the SDGs adoption. It covered 34 companies, categorized into eight sectors: trade, services, and investment; basic industries and chemicals; mining; miscellaneous industries; agriculture; finance; infrastructure, utilities, and transportation; and consumer goods industry. The samples were taken from 102 sustainability reports. This study applies a qualitative approach with descriptive statistics to support the analysis. The results showed that the trade, service, and investment sector companies disclosed the highest SDGs information, followed by basic industries and chemicals, with the consumer goods industries sector disclosing the least. In addition, information related to “no poverty” was the most widely disclosed information in the sustainability reports, followed by “responsible consumption and production” and “life on land.” This study provides useful information for multisector institutions, especially for governments on how to plan future programs for socializing and promoting SDGs as one tool for creating sustainable businesses, as well as for protecting the environment, and improving society’s welfare.

Keywords Sustainable Development Goals  Sustainability Report  Disclosures  Indonesia   2.1 Introduction The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were succeeded by the Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) at the end of 2015, left many valuable lessons on how to improve the world’s condition, and were Influenced by developing needs and a changing world. With the promise of “leave no one behind,” the United Nations urged all nations to commit to reaching the 17 SDGs based on each nation’s needs. The principle of the 17 goals is to preserve the environment and narrow welfare gaps in society to protect our planet and future generations. Indonesia is one of the 193 Nations that are officially committed to supporting the SDGs. This commitment was realized through Presidential Decree no. 59/2017 and the appointment of a Ministry of National Development Planning that would be responsible for the achievement of the SDGs. All achievements need to be evaluated and monitored periodically and the Ministry has closely worked together with other Ministries since its establishment. One of the evaluation tools used is through published sustainability reports that are commonly used to disclose the companies’ practices in supporting the SDGs. Prior to the Presidential Decree, the Financial Service Authority (FSA) also published a new regulation mandating sustainability reports for all Indonesian publically listed companies. Under their regulation POJK 51/POJK.03/2017, the sustainability report practices have been implemented gradually based on the type of industry. The FSA has clearly stipulated that one of the purposes of mandating sustainability reports is to support the SDGs. However, even though sustainability reports have become mandatory for Indonesian listed companies, this study has identified that the understanding of both SDGs and sustainability reports is still at an early stage (Gunawan, Permatasari and Tilt, 2020 ; Gunawan and SeTin, 2019 ). Having understood that SDGs and sustainability reporting needs to be explored by businesses, their adoption also needs time. Businesses or companies need to look at each SDG target and evaluate each against their business strategies. Rosati and Faria (2019a)  said that businesses should report on SDGs that can be aligned with organizational planning, implementing, measuring, and communicating their efforts. This process can be another challenge for many companies, as they need to adjust their operations and strategies to the requirements of the SDGs (Tsalis, et al., 2020 ). In this context, the purpose of this chapter is to provide evidence derived from Indonesian companies on how they have responded to the SDGs and disclosed their support in their sustainability reports from 2016 to 2018. Initially, all samples were taken from the whole population of available sustainability reports, and these were explored to see which sectors provided most SDG information. Then, which goals the majority of the Indonesian publically listed companies had disclosed. The discussions provided deeper understanding and ideas on what should be further planned to support the achievement of targeted SDGs in accordance with the National Development Plan. Indonesia was chosen as a sample as this nation is considered a large developing country that plays an important role in business in Southeast Asia (Gunawan, 2015 ). Further, Kusharsanto and Pradita (2016)  stated that Indonesia is a G20 member with an emerging economy. In September 2020, according to the Asian Development Bank, Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP) reached around 5% in 2018 and 2019, and it is still expected to grow, despite the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the World Bank reported that the economic growth in Indonesia is supported by its commodity markets, a large, young population, and a solid macroeconomic policy framework. However, social conditions still need to be improved progressively considering that around 30% of Indonesians are at risk of poverty. Another condition to consider is the large gap between lower, middle, and upper-class society, and the welfare gap. As well as the social conditions, the environmental issues in Indonesia have drawn global attention due to the large-scale deforestation with majority of it being illegal. Tacconi et al. (2019)  noted that the deforestation occurs despite the law enforcement from the government, and is driven by social conditions that influence the surrounding communities to carry out illegal logging without thinking about the consequences. Hence, the environment and social conditions cannot be separated and these will also influence the economic performance (Erbaugh, 2019 ). The results provided by this study will not only benefit Indonesia, but also other countries in taking further immediate action, and shaping the SDGs into business strategies. Further, support for SDGs does not only benefit the Government or society, but also gives advantages to companies. Martinez-Ferrero and Garcia-Meca (2020)  and Rosati and Faria (2019a)  stated that aligning the relevant SDG target with the business strategy will strengthen internal corporate governance and in the long run create business sustainability. Hence, the results of this study may be taken as ideas to create new programs, to educate, and to communicate to help companies and other related institutions gain the most benefit from targeting relevant SDGs.  2.2 Literature review 2.2.1 Sustainable development goals (SDGs) The 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development Goals, known as SDGs, refers to a new development agreement that encourages changes to shift toward sustainable development based on human rights and equality to promote social welfare, economic stability, and environmental protection. SDGs are enforced with universal, integrated, and inclusive principles to ensure that no one will be left behind. The SDGs consist of 17 Goals and 169 targets to continue the efforts and achievements of the MDGs that ended at the end of 2015. The SDG program accommodates solutions for wider problems compared to the MDGs. SDGs provide more comprehensive targeted goals, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with resolutions for the goals and objectives. The SDG program defines sustainable development as a means of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The SDGs call for efforts to build an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient future for humanity and the planet. Over a 15-year period (2015–2030), new targets will be applied universally covering all countries, whereby each country should prioritize their efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequality, and tackle climate change, as well as to ensure that no country is left behind. This is the essence of SDGs and the commitment to reach the targets will be the responsibility of each country. The SDGs program contains 17 goals, 169 targets, and 241 indicators, with 5 main foundations, namely, people (humans), planet, prosperity (welfare), peace, and partnership. Based on these foundations, each country can develop their own initiatives to be incorporated into the National strategies. To ensure alignment with the SDG programs, Indonesia has applied the goals into the Indonesian National Development Plan. An initial agenda was formulated in 2015 and included increasing awareness and meeting with stakeholders; formulating a Presidential Decree and developing technical notes on SDGs National and regional action Plan (2016); creating SDGs metadata (2017); and developing a 2018–2020 road map, a national action plan that was approved by all stakeholders, and included implementing, monitoring, evaluating, as well as reporting. The essence of the SDGs has also been categorized into Four Pillars of SDGs in Indonesia (sdgindonesia.or.id ) (Fig. 2.1  ). Through intense communication on SDGs, the Indonesian government has successfully become one of the six best voluntary national reviews countries that is focusing on boosting investment plans, reducing investment gaps, and developing priority projects and sectors.  2.2.2 Sustainability reports Sustainability reports have been defined using different criteria with no single conclusion, as there is no right and wrong. According to Elkington (1997) , a sustainability report refers to a report that contains not only financial performance information, but also nonfinancial information consisting of social and environmental information that enables companies to grow in a sustainable manner. The Global Reporting Initiative, a well-known sustainability reporting standard setter, defines a sustainability report as “a report published by a company or organization about the economic, environmental, and social impacts caused by its everyday activities.” Sustainability reporting represents a mechanism to generate data and measure progress, as well as the corporations’ contribution to support the SDGs. By publishing such a report, companies can measure their performance against all aspects of SDGs, including green economy, circular economy, emissions, water, energy, resource efficient, biodiversity, and social impacts. Sustainability reports have been widely used by companies to disclose their sustainability activities, including activities in supporting the SDGs (Fonseca and Carvalho, 2019 ; Rosati and Faria, 2019b ; Siew, 2015 ). Fonseca and Carvalho evaluated the quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety disclosures as the three dimensions for sustainable development. They mapped the level of engagement of Portuguese companies in contributing and reporting the 17 SDGs in their sustainability reports, while Rosati and Faria (2019b)  examined the institutional theory by investigating disclosures in sustainability reports. In addition, Siew (2015)  highlighted the demand for publishing sustainability reports with greater transparency in both environmental and social information. Hence, sustainability reports have become one form of media for corporations to communicate to their stakeholders its social and environmental information, and the activities it has undertaken to support SDGs.   2.3 Materials and methods This study applies a qualitative approach to explore the SDGs support by examining disclosures in sustainability reports by Indonesian publically listed companies. Attempts were made to acquire all sustainability reports for 2016, 2017, and 2018 to be used as samples, regardless of the type of industries. The 2016 reports were used to ascertain the immediate responses from companies once the SDGs had been announced. However, this study does not intend to provide evidence year by year, but covers the period 2016 until 2018 as the early stage when both the Government and companies were still preparing their readiness to support SDGs (Fig. 2.2  ). The content analysis was conducted by awarding a dummy score of 0 (not disclosed) and 1 (disclosure available) according to SDG disclosures accompanied by a logo. This study disregarded any information that may be relevant to SDGs, but was missing any SDG information or logo as this may indicate that the companies were not really aware of supporting SDGs. Content analysis uses a simple method as the only measurement to quantify the qualitative information by giving scores in various ways (Krippendorff, 2018 ). As the purpose of this study is to identify which goals are the most selected goals supported by companies, a score was awarded for all 17 goals. Several steps were taken to conduct the content analysis by examining the sustainability reports. First, each SDG was recorded from the list of disclosures, and then data were taken from all of the sustainability reports from the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). Second, to increase the sample size, sustainability reports were taken from the companies’ websites. Third, to ease the evaluation and for a better understanding, the samples were categorized by sector. There are eight IDX sectors: (1) infrastructure, utilities, and transportation; (2) trade, services, and investment; (3) agriculture; (4) finance; (5) mining; (6) basic industry and chemicals; (7) miscellaneous industry; and (8) consumer good industry. Finally, after awarding scores, analyses were undertaken to see which goals were selected the most and the least to understand the goals supported by the companies. Thereby the Government can develop the relevant programs and create strategies to ensure that SDGs can be achieved.  2.4 Discussion 2.4.1 SDGs disclosures based on industrial sector This study attempts to look at 34 companies as a sample over three sequent years, resulting in a total sample of 102 sustainability reports. After awarding scores, all scores were totaled and averaged to see which sectors disclosed the most SDGs in their sustainability reports and which goals were the most targeted. Fig. 2.3   shows that trade, services, and investment (32%) is the highest sector for SDGs disclosures, followed by basic industries and chemicals (29.8%) and miscellaneous industries (28%). In contrast, the consumer good industry (20.1%), infrastructure, utilities and transportation (23%), and finance (25.05%) were the sectors with the lowest SDGs disclosures. The overall average for SDGs disclosure is 26.32%. This low number can be explained as during the period 2016 until 2018, SDGs disclosures in the sustainability reports was low, with less than 30% of reports disclosing the SDGs information. In addition, the spread from the highest (32%) and the lowest (20.1%) shows a significant difference of 59.2%. The trade, service, and investment industries were the most responsive sector in supporting SDGs. According to Hoekman (2016) , the trade industry is an important process whereby many of the agreed targets can be achieved. To make trade more effective, ways are sought to reduce costs, and this allows companies in developing countries to source their goods in a more competitive way so they can give households better access and thus help improve society’s welfare. Many of the SDGs involve trade and service, as well as responsible investment. On the other hand, the consumer goods industries disclosed little information for supporting SDGs. Having analyzed their business processes, in fact, this type of industry should take more responsibility in using efficient resources so as to become more relevant to “sustainable and responsible production and consumption” (SDG no. 12). Sala and Castellani (2019)  stated that sustainable and responsible production and consumption is very important and is becoming the heart of sustainable development. They explained by providing examples of the life-cycle assessment processes that should be implemented in consumer goods industries. The life-cycle process is an integrated approach that utilizes waste and resources, and therefore increases efficiencies and reduces any negative impact on the environment from the production process. In addition, Oliveira, Tomar, and Tam (2020)  highlight that the consumer goods industries can play a significant role in supporting the environment by creating green packaging using technology, or by improving collaborative consumption. Through collaborative consumption, companies can share resources and individuals to access resources at a lower cost. Consequently, when consumer goods industries carry out these activities, they support SDG no.12 (sustainable and responsible production and consumption) as well as SDG no.11 (sustainable cities and communities), SDG no. 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG no.13 (combat climate change and reduce emission). This support should be disclosed in the sustainability reports to inspire other companies and provide information to stakeholders. Further, the government can also consolidate this information to be reported as the country’s contribution to SDGs. Generally, Fig. 2.3  shows that the SDGs disclosures in the sustainability reports are still limited despite many companies already conducting good and relevant sustainable development. This result can be explained three ways. First, perhaps, the companies do not understand that the activities they have undertaken are supporting SDGs and they should start establishing targets and strategies. Second, the companies may not be aware that disclosing SDGs support could bring benefits for their stakeholders, especially the government, and finally, the companies are not well informed about what SDGs are and what the company has to do. Accordingly, the results indicate that there is an urgent need and demand for more education and socialization about SDGs, including how to map the goals and the benefits for sustainable business.  2.4.2 SDGs disclosures based on goals The next analysis covers the SDGs disclosures results presented in Table 2.1  . It shows that SDG no.1 (no poverty) received the most attention from companies as the average disclosure reached 61.11%, followed by SDG no.12 (responsible consumption and production) with 57.84%, and SDG no.15 (life on land) with 49.02%. On the other hand, quality education (3.92%), peace, justice, and strong Institutions (6.21%), and good health and well-being (6.27%) were the three least disclosed. These findings seem to indicate that for the most disclosed SDGs, companies are well informed on the initiatives needed to support these SDGs, whereas they are ill-informed on the least disclosed SDGs. Supporting less fortunate communities (which is linked to “no poverty”), using efficient resources (related to “responsible consumption and production”), and managing waste (relevant to life on land) are the initiatives activities the companies consider as worth reporting. On the other hand, training and education (which is linked to quality education), practicing good corporate governance (related to peace, justice, and strong Institutions), and health, safety, working environment (relevant to health and well-being) cover the information most commonly stated as this information has become mandatory, and must be disclosed in any of published report. This may explain why the companies are unaware that the activities they routinely conduct, and the information they are familiar with, are actually considered as supporting SDGs. Companies in Indonesia have taken many initiatives to help the government reduce the rate of poverty. In line with World Bank concerns, it seems that the issue of poverty in Indonesia is still highly prevalent, even though the economic conditions have improved over a period and millions of its citizens have moved out of poverty. According to the Asian Development Bank midterm 2020 report, Indonesia is considered as a country with the lowest minus GDP rate (predicted minus 1) compared to other Asian countries (predicted minus 5%). However, the issue of “No Poverty” is still significant. Poverty remains a common problem for many developing countries (Asongu and Odhiambo, 2019 ; Masron and Subramaniam, 2018 ; Ngo, 2018 ). Hanandita and Tampubolon (2015)  and McKague, Wheeler and Karnani (2014)  stated that poverty is one issue with many multidimensional causes and it needs the support of various institutions, including the private sector, government, and civil society organizations. Continuing its effort to reduce poverty is high on the agenda of the Indonesian government. It has its challenges as it involves improving living conditions in rural areas where many of the poor are located. The Government cannot reduce poverty by itself, but needs the support and collaboration from the private sector and other organizations (Larantika et al., 2017 ; McKague, Wheeler and Karnani, 2014 ). Realizing that support from companies is needed to reduce poverty, many corporate social responsibilities (CSR) activities have been conducted by companies in Indonesia. This may be the reason why the SDGs disclosures related to combatting poverty have become the most reported information in the companies’ sustainability reports. The major activities, to reduce poverty, conducted by companies involve providing jobs for low-income individuals and helping small, medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In addition, making donations and philanthropy activities are also considered as helping improve society’s welfare. Ngo (2018)  stated that empowering society through its businesses is one of these methods to help them become entrepreneurs and independent. Education is also seen as a most essential factor for reducing poverty. Further, with the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, the rate of poverty will be much higher in developing countries, including Indonesia. This is the important call for all governments globally to fight the pandemic and to look after the economic condition. Consequently, the issue of poverty will be higher compared to previous years and it is another challenge that the SDG No.1 (No Poverty) target may not be achieved. The second most disclosed information after “No Poverty” is “Responsible Consumption and Production” (SDG no.12), which was disclosed in 57.84% of the samples. This finding is interesting as the consumer goods industries usually use a lot of resources, and the responsible consumption and production is very relevant for this type of industry. However, this industry disclosed the least SDG information compared to other samples, even though the relevant information of responsible consumption and production disclosed was quite high. Further analysis found that the most disclosures for responsible consumption and production occurred in the banking sector, not the customer goods industries. The dominant information disclosure related to reducing paper consumption by using digital banking applications. Other information disclosed in support of SDG no.12 related to using less energy by saving electricity. Other than reducing paper consumption, many of the sustainability reports disclosed information on waste management (reduce, reuse, recycle), especially for effluent from the production activities, and plastic reduction, especially their activities to reduce the use of plastic bottles. The activities supporting this goal are relatively easy for the companies to understand as they are closely related to efficiencies that benefit them. Internal initiatives for reducing waste and natural consumption have been discussed widely even though data showing the reductions are still unavailable. It may take time for the companies to develop data management systems for these activities, in particular calculating the amount of waste reduction. As such, data efficiency is considered as the visible efforts taken by these companies in disclosing their activities and reporting their targets to support SDG no.12. Following a closer analysis, the process of consumption in the companies is mainly associated with the raw materials needed by the manufacturing industries to produce their products. These processes should be based on green manufacturing processing to be relevant to support SDG no.12. While for the service industries, where they do not use raw materials, the consumption is much more in using paper and energy when they deliver services to customers. Saving energy can be calculated when the companies apply efficiencies, usually using innovation technology, and this mainly occurs in the banking industry through their use of digital banking solutions. In addition, reducing transportation would decrease fuel usage and will lead to less energy consumption. These activities are well reported in the sustainability reports and may increase in the near future, as technology applications cannot be separated from the sustainability context (Cavaleri and Shabana, 2018 ; Kenneth et al., 2017 ; Bernal-Conesa, Nieto, Briones-Penalver, 2017 ). Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Obrenovic et al. (2020)  revealed that enterprises’ operations and productivity could be sustained when they apply the effectiveness of business models by using effective technology. “Life on Land” (SDG no.15) was the third most disclosed information in the sustainability reports. The information reported refers to major disclosures on biodiversity and managing waste, and was provided by the basic industries and chemicals, miscellaneous, and mining industries. These three industries addressed the issue to show their responsibilities in managing the negative impact of their business operations. For mining companies, land protection involves the maintenance or improvement of the land conditions during mine-closures by applying sustainable land management methodologies (Asmeri, Alvionita, and Gunardi, 2017 ; Trireksani and Djajadikerta, 2016 ; Barkemeyer et al., 2015 ). ‘Life on land’ is actually very close to the agriculture processes. Having analyzed the findings in this study, it shows that the agriculture industries disclosed 25.1% information, and a further examination was conducted. The results showed that the majority of disclosures by agriculture industries relating to Life on land issues involved the efforts made for land protection through promoting sustainable forestry, management certifications, and preventing soil contamination from all sources by reducing chemical fertilizer usage. Other industries, apart from agriculture, disclosed some information on biodiversity protection and waste management to support Life on land. Besides agriculture being responsible for protecting life on land, Arana et al. (2020) and Nhemachena et al. (2018)  stated that any industry that uses a lot of water will significantly impact life on land, with one being the agricultural industries. Having analyzed the samples used in this study, it was noted that the companies publishing sustainability reports are those categorized as large-sized companies. Similarly, agriculture and mining companies that disclose their compliance in fulfilling the environmental regulations, do so as information on sustainable land management is required by the law. Nasih et al. (2019)  also stated that agriculture and mining industries are the two sectors that need to disclose the most environmental information to show their compliance to regulations as well as for transparency and accountability. Among the most disclosed information, unfortunately, information related to ‘quality education’ (SDG no.4) was low compared to the other disclosures. Having examined the sustainability reports, in fact, there is a lot of training and education information disclosed by companies to support their employees’ capabilities. In addition, social responsibility activities also included many educational programs addressed to the communities. As the disclosures for supporting quality education (SDG no.4) were low, it was observed that this happens as the companies do not put the SDG logo indicating their support. They also did not mention any SDGs connection when reporting their training activities, even though the education was disclosed. This finding confirms the assumption that the low number of SDGs disclosures is not due to there being no information disclosed, but because the companies did not state that they support the SDGs. A lack of understanding of SDGs could be the main reason, as companies do not understand why they need to refer to and report on SDGs in their sustainability reports. This assumption is also strengthened by the finding of Gunawan, Permatasari and Tilt (2020)  who stated that Indonesian companies tend to focus their business and CSR activities in support of SDG no. 4, which is quality education. Further, this explains why poor quality education is one of the major factors leading to community problems, and therefore corporations should help the Government improve education. Previously, Soobaroyen and Mahadeo (2016)  also noticed that education is one of the most common areas in need of improvement in the communities. Hence, filling the gaps in the knowledge and benefits of SDGs is essential so as to inform companies that conduct educational programs that they are supporting SDG no. 4. This understanding is important so they can develop strategies to help reach the 2030 educational targets (Allen, Metternicht, Wiedmann, 2019 ). Similar assumptions were also proven in the minimum disclosures in “Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions” (SDG no.16) and “Good Health and Well-being’” (SDG no.3). Having analyzed the disclosures in the sustainability reports, there is much information reported related to these two SDGs. Information, such as stakeholders’ engagement process, compliance to regulations, and zero-tolerance policy toward corruption and bribery are some of the major disclosure examples that support SDG no.16. Additionally, information on health, safety, and security in the working place, and helping communities by providing good medical services and equipment are the two major information disclosures in the sustainability reports. Unfortunately, all of this information disclosed did not include any information related to the SDGs they support. As previously discussed, it seems that a lack of understanding of SDGs is the core problem for the companies in providing disclosures as they may think this kind of information is just “common” mandatory information, and does not need to be associated with SDGs. As suggested by Cernev and Fenner (2020) , understanding SDGs is important as the impact of nonachievement of SDG targets may expose humanity to risk. They expressed their concern as SDGs receive limited attention. Further, as some of sustainable development targets are fundamental, including SDG no.3 and SDG no.16, Cernev and Fenner stated the importance of synergy among multistakeholders, especially governments and corporations. Generally, the results of this study suggest that Indonesian companies tend to disclose comprehensive information when it is mandatory and if not, they like to inform activities dealing with community’s needs. Health and education, as a basic need of communities, has become a concern for companies to show that they care for their stakeholders (Cernev and Fenner, 2020 ). As the communities are commonly cited as one of the main stakeholders for most industries, stakeholder theory is considered to be relevant in explaining this situation (Aguiñag, et al., 2018 ). Another discussion is needed to compare a prior study that applied a different sample of reports. A similar study conducted by Gunawan, Permatasari and Tilt (2020)  provided quite different findings as they used both annual and sustainability reports for 2014–2016, while this study only uses sustainability reports for 2016–2018. Gunawan, Permatasari and Tilt found that disclosures in annual reports were higher compared to sustainability reports as companies are required to publish annual reports based on the Financial Service Authority Regulations, while sustainability reports are still voluntarily, except for the banking industry were it became mandatory in 2019. Hence, the SDG disclosures in this study may also be affected by the limited extent of SDG information. The study conducted by Gunawan, Permatasari and Tilt (2020)  looked at the years before (2014 and 2015) and early adoption of SDG (2016), while this study looks at all early years of SDGs adoption, from 2016 to 2018. These different periods will undoubtedly influence the extent and type of disclosures, as the longer the SDGs are adopted will create a higher understanding in disclosing SDGs-related activities (Allen, Metternicht, Wiedmann, 2019 ). Furthermore, the findings for “Good Health and Well Being” was the second most disclosed in Gunawan, Permatasari and Tilt (2020) , while in this study, this information was found to be minor. This difference may be explained by the fact that information on Good Health and Well Being is disclosed more extensively in annual reports rather than in sustainability reports, or there may be a change in SDGs prioritization in supporting the goals year by year. If one company discloses different priority goals in different years, it may lead to another assumption that can be analyzed further. One premise could be that companies may not understand how to prioritize SDGs according to their business strategies. They also may not be familiar with the SDG Compass, which explains the step-by-step approach in supporting SDGs and that is why the disclosure of Goals priorities is different from year to year. Besides these differences, information related to “Responsible Consumption and Production” has been disclosed dominantly both in the annual and sustainability reports, and hence the findings of this study supports the Gunawan, Permatasari and Tilt’s (2020)  finding. Similar findings may also explain why the disclosure for Responsible Consumption and Production is consistent each year. Arana et al. (2020)  and Franco and Newey (2020)  support this discussion by articulating that responsible consumption and production is one of the approaches for wellbeing, including the communities. As companies in Indonesia are likely to disclose information related to communities (Gunawan, 2015 ), so it may be relevant to explain that responsible consumption and production information should be disclosed consistently both in annual and sustainability reports to show companies are concerned with helping community wellbeing.   2.5 Conclusion This chapter provides a preliminary review of the efforts being made by Indonesian companies in supporting SDGs by examining the disclosures in their sustainability reports. The total samples gathered came from 102 reports from 34 companies for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 reporting period. The results showed that the company sectors that provided the most SDGs disclosures were (1) Trade, services, and investment sector (32%); (2) basic industries and chemicals (29.8%); and (3) miscellaneous industries (28%). On the other hand, the sectors that provided the least SDGs disclosures were (1) The consumer goods industry (20.1%); (2) Infrastructure, utilities, and transportation (23%); and (3) finance industries (25.05%). The overall average of SDGs disclosure was 26.32%. This finding confirms the early assumption that SDGs information disclosures in the 2016–2018 sustainability reports was still low, as this period was the early stage of SDGs adoption. The next finding demonstrates that “No poverty” information was the highest disclosure (61.11%), followed by “Responsible consumption and production” information (57.84%) and “Life on land” information (49.02%). This finding is in line with the situation in developing countries, including Indonesia, where they are still combatting poverty as one of the main social issues. In contrast, information related to “quality education” (SDG no.4) was the lowest disclosure. This finding showed that although information about education including training, scholarships, and workshops was discussed widely in the sustainability reports, it was not clearly explained that these activities support SDG no.4. As assumed, the absence of SDGs information references may be due to minimum understanding about SDGs and the benefits of linking the SDGs to the companies’ business strategies, including corporate social responsibility activities targets. This study provides contributions to governments not only in Indonesia but also other countries as the findings may describe the same situation in other developing countries. The government should plan the right programs to socialize the SDGs, especially for promoting the benefits to companies, and on how to create sustainable business by protecting the environment, and increasing local community welfare. Further, the government should also develop collaborations with other governmental institutions, regulators, corporations (private, state-owned, and multinational corporations), educational institutions, and other countries to work together to achieve the SDGs. To be more in line with the SDGs and priority issues in each country, the Government may have to consider providing guidelines to assist every corporation in selecting the relevant goals. Simple guidelines can be developed to help assist companies with incentives as a driver for companies to practice SDGs as a form of appreciation. These ideas may benefit both governments and corporations, and importantly, the achievement of sustainable development targets. Another lesson that should be addressed is the importance of SDGs being acknowledged by the companies, where their support for the goals also benefits them in shaping their businesses. It would be too complicated for companies to take all the Goals as one Goal as they contain many indicators. Thus, selecting the relevant goals is important and can be achieved by mapping their priorities in line with the businesses’ strategies. Taking only a number of goals based on the companies’ efforts should be considered enough as long as the target and initiatives can be implemented and measured. The most important issue is that the results from supporting the Goals can bring a positive impact and support “leave no one behind.” As a preliminarily finding of SDGs disclosures in the early stages of implementation, this study provides a platform for further studies to examine the SDGs supports in the period after 2018. The prediction is that SDGs activities and disclosures should be higher in the future, as over time understanding of SDGs will be deeper, and the Government will have intensely promoted the SDGs. While the benefits of adopting SDGs can be defined, a better adoption will make it easier for companies to link their strategies, not only for the current goals, but also for future targets. This study has some limitations. First, the limited number of sustainability reports provided may result in some generalization regarding all Indonesian companies. As annual reports are not included in this evaluation, it may also result in a gap in presenting the extent of disclosures only in sustainability reports, even though sustainability reports are considered as the most relevant for disclosing SDGs. It is suggested that future research should analyze the disclosures more comprehensively, using both annual and sustainability reports. This should be conducted regularly to provide a trend and analyze the improvement of sustainable activities. The types of industry will also be another interesting area to be discussed to see whether there is a pattern of industrial types related to each goal, in line with their business’ strategies.
