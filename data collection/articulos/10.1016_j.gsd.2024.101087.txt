                  While several articles have focused on determining a suitability map for groundwater exploitation by assigning weights to different thematic layers, this technique suffers from a lack of worldwide application because it focuses on the features of a specific region (terrain features, vegetation, and climate) during the investigation. To overcome this drawback, we expanded the evaluation method of groundwater exploitation by integrating the region characteristics and topography with the three pillars of sustainability outlined by the SDGs agenda. Seven thematic layers, reflecting the economic and technical characteristics of El-Saloum depression, Egypt, were prepared to develop a solar energy-based groundwater suitability map. It was depicted that about 11.5%, 29.3%, and 44.0% of the total depression were classified into “Most’, “Moderate”, and “Marginal” suitable locations, respectively. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the southeastern zone of the depression emerged as the most suitable site for solar-groundwater utilization due to its low salinity (<5000 ppm), reasonable groundwater depths (less than 50 m), and land availability (undeveloped regions). Substituting a diesel power system (DPS) with a photovoltaic system (PVS) in groundwater pumping and/or reverse osmosis (RO) desalination would reduce 1.2 kg CO2/kWh and maintain a payback period of 6.4 years with a cost of energy (COE) of ∼0.25 US$/kWh. Applying PVS for groundwater management could fulfill about 25.0%, 37.5%, 40.0%, and 20.0% of sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2 “Zero hunger”, 6 “Clean water and sanitation”, 7 “Affordable and clean energy”, 13 “Climate action”. The achievement of these SDGs was equivalent to 22.7%, 15.4%, and 13.2% of the environmental, economic, and social pillars of sustainability, respectively. Consequently, the study's findings are crucial for stakeholders and policymakers involved in the sustainable management of groundwater resources within the SDGs umbrella.

While several articles have focused on determining a suitability map for groundwater exploitation by assigning weights to different thematic layers, this technique suffers from a lack of worldwide application because it focuses on the features of a specific region (terrain features, vegetation, and climate) during the investigation. To overcome this drawback, we expanded the evaluation method of groundwater exploitation by integrating the region characteristics and topography with the three pillars of sustainability outlined by the SDGs agenda. Seven thematic layers, reflecting the economic and technical characteristics of El-Saloum depression, Egypt, were prepared to develop a solar energy-based groundwater suitability map. It was depicted that about 11.5%, 29.3%, and 44.0% of the total depression were classified into “Most’, “Moderate”, and “Marginal” suitable locations, respectively. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the southeastern zone of the depression emerged as the most suitable site for solar-groundwater utilization due to its low salinity (<5000 ppm), reasonable groundwater depths (less than 50 m), and land availability (undeveloped regions). Substituting a diesel power system (DPS) with a photovoltaic system (PVS) in groundwater pumping and/or reverse osmosis (RO) desalination would reduce 1.2 kg CO2 /kWh and maintain a payback period of 6.4 years with a cost of energy (COE) of ∼0.25 US$/kWh. Applying PVS for groundwater management could fulfill about 25.0%, 37.5%, 40.0%, and 20.0% of sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2 “Zero hunger”, 6 “Clean water and sanitation”, 7 “Affordable and clean energy”, 13 “Climate action”. The achievement of these SDGs was equivalent to 22.7%, 15.4%, and 13.2% of the environmental, economic, and social pillars of sustainability, respectively. Consequently, the study's findings are crucial for stakeholders and policymakers involved in the sustainable management of groundwater resources within the SDGs umbrella.

Groundwater exists under three phases (i) seawater (SW) that requires large amounts of energy to carry out the desalination process, (ii) brackish water (BW) that can be either pumped for irrigation and livestock or desalinated for many purposes (Jones, 2015 ), and (iii) freshwater (FW) that can be directly pumped for human use (Bauder et al., 2011 ). Electricity is the energy-feeding source used for either groundwater pumping or desalination; however, it may not be available in rural areas. Therefore, the dependence on diesel power systems (DPSs) has recently become popular as an energy source to satisfy the power involved in the groundwater supply infrastructure (Girma, 2017 ). Unfortunately, this scenario causes many harmful emissions, e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2 ) to human health, and it's negatively influenced by the fluctuations in fossil fuel prices worldwide (Kelley et al., 2010 ). Therefore, many researchers have started to investigate the possibility of applying renewable energy, e.g., solar systems, for groundwater management (Sayed et al., 2019 ). However, there is a lack of research in finding an appropriate framework for selecting the most suitable locations for groundwater exploitation by solar energy (GESE). Also, it is essential to determine the benefits of using solar energy to fulfill the environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability, ensuring the worldwide application of the proposed location selection strategy. Geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria analysis (MCA) represents an effective technique for solar/groundwater suitability mapping (Salim, 2012 ; Kwak et al., 2021 ). This technique has been applied to delineate and identify the best locations for solar energy and groundwater utilization (Sayed et al., 2019 ; Shao et al., 2020 ), wind power plants (Eroğlu, 2021 ), and solar and wind farms (Saraswat et al., 2021 ) due to its reliability and time-saving. The GIS platform could prepare, manipulate, and visualize different spatial formats, e.g., vector and raster, for deriving a map of groundwater potential zones (Basaran et al., 2015 ). Multiple thematic layers of this map could be effectively defined by the MCA methods, such as rank reciprocal (RR), rank sum (RS), and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (Zardari et al., 2014 ; Akbar et al., 2023 ). The RR method performance was better than that of RS and AHP in getting the ideal locations of solar-powered panels in Kayseri, Turkey (Akif Günen, 2021 ). Based on the effectiveness of GIS and MCA, they could be combined and applied to obtain the suitability maps of groundwater management (Mallick et al., 2019 ). This step is followed by sensitivity analysis implemented to determine the influence of changes in input data on the eco-friendly output suitability map (Jones, 2015 ; Al Garni and Awasthi, 2017 ). Solar energy represents an affordable, and eco-friendly choice for operating groundwater-related projects in remote undeveloped areas compared with conventional DPS (Kettani and Bandelier, 2020 ). Moreover, it can be converted to electric power via several means like photovoltaic (PV) panels, which have been recently adopted for groundwater management (Ibrik, 2020 ). Furthermore, these panels are characterized by standalone operation, little maintenance, noise avoidance, and flexible integration to desalination systems, e.g., reverse osmosis (RO) (Girma, 2017 ; Macedo et al., 2021 ). However, they significantly affect land use patterns as they need massive non-occupied places to effectively generate electricity (Noman et al., 2023 ). The suitable location for constructing photovoltaic systems (PVSs) for groundwater pumping/desalination is affected by many economic and technical criteria, such as groundwater salinity (GWS), and solar radiation (SR) (Abo Zaid, 2015 ; Al Garni and Awasthi, 2017 ). These criteria should be considered by investors and developers to reduce overall costs and attain high performance when planning for GESE projects (Sayed et al., 2019 ). To have a reliable and worldwide framework for determining the best locations for groundwater-related projects, GESE should be adequately managed to fulfill the targets of the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) endorsed by the United Nations (https://sdgs.un.org/goals ). These SDGs include access to affordable water and clean energy (Schwerhoff and Sy, 2017 ), complying with the objectives of GESE planning and management. For instance, the life cycle cost of a PVS was about one-third of a diesel power system (DPS) for an irrigation pumping system in Gerenbo, Ethiopia (Nasir, 2019 ), fulfilling SDG 7 “Affordable and clean energy ”. Moreover, the generated harmful emissions due to the hybrid PVS/DPS system were less than the DPS by about 90% for water pumping systems in the Bugesera district, Rwanda (Rutibabara and Budzianowski, 2018 ), meeting SDG 13 “Climate action ”. Furthermore, implementing PV desalination water units for satisfying the needs of a population in the northwest coast of Egypt has contributed to poverty eradication and enhancement of living standards (Abo Zaid, 2015 ), complying with SDG 1 “No poverty ”. The outputs of these studies suggest that determining a suitability map for groundwater exploitation should follow the dual criteria of thematic parameters and SDGs fulfillment. While several approaches have been employed to select the optimum locations for groundwater withdrawal and exploitation, these techniques should meet the techno-economic and sustainability criteria. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to delineate groundwater potential zones using the synergistic integration of the region characteristics and topography and the three pillars of sustainability outlined by the SDGs agenda. Hence, the study objectives are threefold: (1) delineating the suitability map for GESE using seven thematic layers in El-Saloum depression, and determining the most influencing layer using sensitivity analysis, (2) determining the techno-economic benefits from applying PVS in groundwater exploitation, as compared to conventional DPS, and (3) finding the synergistic interaction between GESE projects and SDGs fulfillment. These objectives are vital for either policymakers or stakeholders to maintain sustainable groundwater management and aquifer exploitation, especially in energy-stressed countries.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area El-Saloum depression was chosen in this study to mimic the promising locations for the dual exploitation of groundwater and solar energy in remote coastal areas (Salim, 2012 ). This depression is a rural coastal area situated in the western desert of Egypt, particularly, near the Egypt-Libya border (Fig. 1  ). It extends along the northwestern coast to cover an area of ∼1042.6 km2 , disseminating between longitudes: (25°08′26ℙ- 25°43′33ℙ) E, and latitudes (31°14′54ℙ - 31°34′04ℙ) N. The depression is bounded by the Marmarica Plateau in all directions except the north boundary at the Mediterranean Sea existence. It enjoys a higher potential for solar radiation (SR) throughout the year because Egypt lies close to the equator in the best sun belt region according to its geographic location. The depression contains three successive layers based on its lithostratigraphic composition (i) surface soil composed of alluvial deposits and friable sand, (ii) second stratum containing unsaturated fractured limestone intercalated by clay lenses, and (iii) the third unit arranged into fractured limestone, representing a water-bearing formation layer. Groundwater pumped from this aquifer provides residents with an essential part of water to satisfy their agricultural and domestic needs. In addition, groundwater is mainly recharged by rainfall (El-Sayed and Mohamaden, 2017 ) in addition to some contributions from flash floods in the eastern region (Gad, 2009 ).  2.2 Stepwise framework for delineating potential zones of sustainable groundwater exploitation by solar energy (GESE) The study methodology was based on developing a set of thematic layers to reflect the techno-economic features of El-Saloum depression, ensuring sustainable groundwater withdrawal schemes. Several studies on the study area and comparable spatial features worldwide were reviewed to select the appropriate thematic layers related to groundwater exploitation by solar energy (Effat, 2016 ; Kwak et al., 2021 ; Macedo et al., 2021 ; Sayed et al., 2019 ). Each thematic layer included a set of sub-classes and was assigned a weight using the MCA technique. A weighted overlay suitability model assisted by GIS was employed to derive the output map of GESE. Then, sensitivity analysis was performed to arrange the input layers. Next, an economic analysis was performed to check the feasibility of utilizing solar energy for groundwater management. Finally, the correlation pattern between the study findings and SDGs was illustrated. These steps are clarified in the following lines (Fig. 2  ): 2.2.1 Data collection To fulfill the objectives of the current research, two main types of data, i.e., measured and remote sensing data, were retrieved. Regarding measured data, the values of groundwater salinity were collected following Zarif et al. (2018) , while the groundwater depth patterns were compiled after El-Sayed and Mohamaden (2017) . Conversely, a set of remote sensing data was downloaded from different sources, including a map of roads (https://www.arcgis.com ), a raster of SR (https://globalsolaratlas.info ), a 2022 Landsat image, and a digital elevation model (DEM; https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov ).  2.2.2 Preparation of thematic layers The obtained data were applied to prepare seven economic and technical thematic maps affecting GESE in El-Saloum depression. These thematic layers are described as follows: 2.2.2.1 Layer 1 groundwater salinity (GWS) The GIS interpolation tool was adopted to delineate the GWS map according to the chemical analysis of the water samples collected from different wells (Zarif et al., 2018 ). Then, the map was categorized into four sub-classes, i.e., <500, 500–2000, 2000–5000, and >5000 ppm, following Zaman et al. (2018) .  2.2.2.2 Layer 2 depth to groundwater (DGW) The depth to groundwater (DGW) map was drawn and classified into four sub-classes, varying between <12.75 m and >37.71 m (Sayed et al., 2019 ). DGW is relatively shallow, where the northern border of the study domain has smaller DGW values that gradually increase towards the southern direction.  2.2.2.3 Layer 3 Land use/land cover (LULC) Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) 4.8 software was adopted for the study area to deduce the land use/land cover (LULC) pattern. The obtained LULC map was arranged into five classes: ‘vegetation’, ‘urban’, ‘undeveloped’, ‘sandbars’, and ‘sabkhas’, as previously reported (Ghosh et al., 2020 ). Most locations of the depression were covered by undeveloped land, while the other LULC classes were distributed over the northern and eastern zones.  2.2.2.4 Layer 4 distance to roads (DTR) The ‘Euclidean Distance’ tool in GIS functions was used to draw the distance to roads (DTR) map according to the obtained network of main roads. Based on the ‘Symbology’ tab, the output map included four sub-classes, i.e., <3.41, 3.41–6.81, 6.81–10.22, >10.22 km. This classification agrees with previous research studies (e.g. Barakat et al., 2016 ; Radjah et al., 2020 ), explaining the effect of DTR on defining the final assessment maps.  2.2.2.5 Layer 5 aspect (AS) The DEM was inserted into the aspect (AS) tool of GIS to plot the AS map of the study region, following Singh and Thakur (2019) . Next, ten sub-categories (Rawat et al., 2015 ), i.e., ‘north’, ‘south’, ‘east’, ‘west’, ‘northeast’, ‘southeast’, ‘northwest’, ‘southwest’, and ‘flat’, were used to explain the AS raster.  2.2.2.6 Layer 6 surface slope (SS) The ‘Slope’ tool in the GIS toolbox was implemented to generate the surface slope (SS) map using the DEM as the input dataset. Four slope classes, viz , <3, 3–6, 6–9, and >9° (°), were arranged in the depression domain. This slope gradient was in agreement with the description introduced by Macedo et al. (2021) , exhibiting the negative influence of steep slopes on the potentiality of solar PV locations compared to gentle slopes.  2.2.2.7 Layer 7 solar radiation (SR) The SR map was created by clipping the obtained SR raster in the GIS platform after performing georeferencing processes. Then, the clipped map of the study domain was divided into groups: <5.41, 5.41–5.52, 5.52–5.62, >5.62 kWh/m2 /day, using the ‘Symbology’ tab (Soydan, 2021 ).   2.2.3 Rating of sub-classes The thematic layers were divided into sub-classes based on their relative importance on a rating scale between 1 and 4 (Table 1  ). These ratings were selected based on the study area characteristics, following Effat (2016) , Kwak et al. (2021) , and Macedo et al. (2021) . A higher level of criterion rating indicated a positive impact on the output map of GESE (i.e., the final suitability map). For example, the sub-class “GWS <500 ppm” was assigned the “4” rating because this region has the most suitable groundwater quality for human consumption.  2.2.4 Multi-criteria analysis Following the sub-classes ratings, the RR-related MCA method was adopted to estimate the final weights of the overlay process (Zardari et al., 2014 ):• Step 1 .  A rank (Ri ) between 1 (most important) and 9 (least important) was given to each thematic layer. These ranks were assigned according to their influence on determining the suitability degree of GESE.  • Step 2 .  Estimating the final weight of each layer (Wi ) by Eq. (1) :   Eq. (1) W i  = 1 R i   ∑ i = 1  n  R i        where, n represents the number of layers.  2.2.5 Estimation of suitability degree The ‘Raster Calculator’ tool in the GIS software was applied using Eq. (2)  to delineate solar/groundwater suitability zones (Al Garni and Awasthi, 2017 ):Eq. (2) Groundwater  suitability  degree  ( GSD )  = ∑ i = 1  n  W i  × Th i      where, Thi  denotes the thematic layer after assigning rantings to its sub-classes.  2.2.6 Sensitivity analysis for the suitability model Sensitivity analysis was performed to clarify how the accuracy of the output suitability map is dependent on the selected input criteria (Shao et al., 2020 ). Two types of sensitivity analysis, i.e., map removal sensitivity analysis (MRSA) and single parameter sensitivity analysis (SPSA), were employed to understand the behavior of the suitability model under different input criteria arrangements (see Supplementary Fig. S1 ; Eq. S1  and Eq. S2 ).   2.3 The framework of cost-benefit analysis of groundwater exploitation by solar energy (GESE) The profitability of solar energy for groundwater exploitation could be illustrated by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis (Yousif, 2013 ; Jones, 2015 ). This analysis was conducted on areas of mild salinity, i.e., <5000 ppm (Yousif, 2013 ; Sayed et al., 2019 ), incorporating a PVS and a DPS in groundwater utilization. Fig. 3   depicts the components of these energy-generating systems for (i) pumping groundwater in the FW/BW zone (alternative_1), or (ii) pumping followed by RO treatment in the BW zone (alternative_2). Regarding the PVS design, it consisted of PV panels, a converter unit, and a battery bank. In the suggested configuration, the PV panels transform the sun rays into an electric direct current (DC), which is turned into an electric alternating current (AC) by a converter. A lead–acid battery bank, widely used in renewable energy systems, was applied to overcome any electrical current shortage/deficit and ensure steady energy balance and water consumption during cloudy days and nighttime (Shouman et al., 2016 ). Concerning the DPS configuration, it comprised a diesel-fueled engine generator. The energy system was designed to lift a total dynamic head (TDH) in (m) with its corresponding energy requirement (ER) in (kWh/day), (Eqs. (3)–(5 )) (Othman, 2017 ).Eq. (3) TDH = h s  + h d  + DD + h f      Eq. (4) PP = ρ × g × Q × TDH  60 × 60 × 1000       Eq. (5) ER = PP η m  × η e    × ( 1 + %  PV l   )  × n w      where, hs  = Suction head in (m), hd  = Delivery head in (m), hf  = Friction losses in (m), DD = Drawdown value in (m), PP = Pump power in (kW), g = Gravitational acceleration in (m/s2 ), ρ    = Density of the fluid in (kg/m3 ), Q = Discharge of flowing water in (m3 /hr), η m     = Mechanical efficiency, η e     = Electrical efficiency, %  PV l     = Percent of losses in the PVS, and nw  = Number of working hours. In this study, the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) Pro software was applied to visualize the proposed PVS and DPS and carry out all the calculations. HOMER was released by the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This optimization tool enables users to develop and arrange the size of the micro-power systems’ constituent parts (Gokcek, 2018 ). It carries out three basic functions, including simulation, optimization, and sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity analysis was performed to illustrate the impact of input variables on the outputs considering financial risks and prices variation (Connor et al., 2022 ). Up-to-date market prices, with some assumptions considered from previous studies (Kettani and Bandelier, 2020 ), were used in this analysis (see Supplementary Table S1 ). To simplify the comparison process between PVS and DPS, any common components to deliver water (e.g., pumps, pipes, fittings, and wires) were excluded from the economic calculations, as previously reported (Kelley et al., 2010 ; Girma, 2017 ). Three economic indicators (Eqs. (6)–(8 )), in addition to one environmental indicator (Eq. (9) ) (Shezan et al., 2016 ), were used in this comparative study (Rutibabara, 2018 ):Eq. (6) NPC = ∑ t = 0  N  C t  ( 1 + i r   )  t    ER      where, NPC is net present cost, representing the overall lifetime cost (capital and operating expenses) of the system in US$/kWh, Ct  = Annual total cost (US$), ir  = Real discount rate given by the absolute difference between the inflation rate and the nominal discount rate, and N = Project lifetime (years).Eq. (7) COE = C t  E t       where, COE is the cost of energy, indicating the system's overall average cost for producing one kWh of electrical energy in US$/kWh, and Et  = Yearly consumed energy in kWh.Eq. (8) PBP = I I  N P       where, PBP is the payback period, giving the time required to recover the initial cash investment in years, II  = Initial investment in US$, and NP  = Net profit (US$/year).Eq. (9)  Resulting  CO 2  = 3.667 × m fuel  × FHV × CEF fuel  × X c   365 × ER       where, Resulting CO2  = the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) resulting from the implementation of DPSs for groundwater exploitation, mfuel  = the amount of fuel in liters, FHV = fuel heating value in MJ/L, CEFfuel  = carbon emission factor measured in ton carbon/TJ, and Xc  = oxidized carbon fraction. The given data also considered that 3.667 g of CO2  comprises 1 g of carbon (Shezan et al., 2016 ).  2.4 Research contribution to sustainable development goals (SDGs) The contribution of the GESE study inputs and outputs in achieving the targets of SDGs was investigated. The SDGs associated with the energy source scenarios (PVS and DPS) were identified according to the number of targets achieved per goal (Saqr et al., 2021 ). This number was divided by the total number of targets in the corresponding goal (Saqr et al., 2023a ), giving the fulfillment of each SDG (see Supplementary Fig. S2 ).   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Thematic layers and overall suitability map for groundwater exploitation by solar energy (GESE) A relative weight was assigned to each layer to exhibit the layer's influence on expressing the GESE suitability condition. The prioritizing process was carried out to reflect the characteristics of the area under study, following Sayed et al. (2019) . The results of criteria weights using the RR technique compared with the literature data obtained from the RS method were summarized (see Table 1 ). The calculation process of the resulting weights is illustrated in Supplementary Tables (S2–S4). The layouts of the seven thematic layers (Fig. 4 a–g) were assigned as follows: 3.1.1 Layout of groundwater salinity (GWS) The MCA output revealed that GWS was the major effective parameter with a relative weight of about 38.6% (Fig. 4 a). This high percentage reflects the essential role of GWS in prioritizing the groundwater locations to satisfy the water needs of different creatures (Alao et al., 2023 ). Hence, the zones of GWS <500 ppm were considered the best places for groundwater withdrawal. Similarly, Bauder et al. (2011)  reported that GWS below 500 ppm was acceptable for various human activities, and it couldn't impose serious effects on the health or performance of livestock, and plants.  3.1.2 Layout of depth to groundwater (DGW) DGW (Fig. 4 b) was considered the second influencing factor of groundwater suitability sites, showing a weight of nearly 21.5%. Generally, the groundwater exploitation efficiency and cost are directly related to DGW. As such, it is required to deepen the existing well that ran dry and/or decrease the pumping rate to guarantee safe yield if groundwater levels significantly drop during consumption (Liu et al., 2018 ). Additionally, the energy required for lifting water would rise to compensate for the increasing pumping head (Turner et al., 2019 ). Hence, shallow groundwater levels exhibit preferable locations for well construction.  3.1.3 Layout of land use/land cover (LULC) Following GWS and DGW, the current assessment study demonstrated that a weight of ∼13% was given to the LULC layer (Fig. 4  c). For instance, the development and reclamation initiatives that depend on solar PV panels and groundwater are highly influenced by the LULC patterns. Undeveloped areas, e.g., desert lands and raw lands, have many free spaces for occupying reclamation projects and opportunities. However, sabkhas are inappropriate for establishing development activities because they are ecologically sensitive areas and their environment is a sink for both evaporitic and siliciclastic sediments (Macedo et al., 2021 ). Kwak et al. (2021)  also outlined the significant role of LULC classification in distributing the solar PV panels in the state of Illinois, USA. Their study demonstrated that barren regions rather than sabkhas areas have a high potential for constructing PV systems.  3.1.4 Layout of distance to roads (DTR) The thematic layer of DTR (Fig. 4 d) was suggested to affect the output map suitability with an assigned weight of approximately 10%. The northern and southeastern zones of the area under study were very close to the main roads. This situation could allow for the future connection between PV panels and high-voltage electric power lines. Moreover, near DTR tends to facilitate the operation and maintenance processes for the normal functioning of solar panels (Janke, 2010 ).  3.1.5 Layout of surface slope (SS) The MCA results showed that ∼7.7% of the groundwater suitability patterns were retained by the SS of the catchment area (Fig. 4 e). PV panels installed on areas with high SS (e.g., >9○ ) could create shade on the neighboring units. This topographic arrangement could reduce the energy conversion efficiency (Effat, 2016 ), negatively impacting the overall construction costs of the project. Therefore, gentle and mild steepness estimates (e.g., <3○ ) in most locations of the study area were preferable for setting up the PV infrastructure, avoiding a non-economic feasible scenario.  3.1.6 Layout of aspect (AS) This research study also demonstrated that the AS layer (Fig. 4 f) could influence the suitability locations with a weight of 6.43%. It was observed that the AS angle had a positive relationship with the direction of sun rays in the study basin. In particular, the orientation of solar panels with earth topography towards the south, southeast, and southwest could facilitate the harvesting of solar energy (the incidence of solar insolation). In contrast, the complex terrain areas oriented in the north, northeast, and northwest cause obstacles to PV installation in the direction of sun rays (Macedo et al., 2021 ). Thus, the inappropriate ground surface orientation would decline the density of the compiled solar rays, lowering the energy production profiles.  3.1.7 Layout of solar radiation (SR) According to MCA findings (Fig. 4 g), SR was proposed to affect the final suitability map with a weight of about 5.5%. This small percentage could be ascribed to the narrow SR range of variation between 5.4 kWh/m2 /day in the north and 5.6 kWh/m2 /day in the south. This annual average daily value encourages the establishment of solar panels as recommended by the classification of the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Phuangpornpitak and Tia, 2016 ). The amount of total SR is affected by various conditions, including atmospheric constituents and sun angle variations (Kwak et al., 2021 ).  3.1.8 Layout of output suitability map The thematic layers (Fig. 4 a–g) were integrated based on their derived weights using the RR method to get a suitability map of GESE in the depression under study. This final map was appropriately classified into four categories, in terms of suitability degree (Fig. 4 h). About 120 km (∼11.5% of the total depression) was categorized as “Most Suitable”. This category was followed by ∼15.2% for “Least Suitable”, ∼29.3% for “Moderately Suitable”, and ∼44% for “Marginally Suitable”. Because the suitability degree is directly correlated to affordable groundwater and clean energy (Al-Saidi and Lahham, 2019 ), a reasonable portion of the study depression could offer promising opportunities for developing groundwater-based solar power projects. The above findings were consistent with the results of the RS method adopted by Al Garni and Awasthi (2017) , especially in the zone with GWS <5000 ppm (see Supplementary Fig. S3 ). This zone shared ∼36% of the total depression area and it could mainly describe the “Most Suitable”, “Least Suitable”, and “Moderately Suitable” areas. This zone could be used to pump water for human consumption, livestock activities, and plant irrigation without intensive desalination procedures (Sayed et al., 2019 ). The matching between the RR and RS output maps was well explored (see Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Following the delineation of the output suitability map, sensitivity analysis was performed to demonstrate the uncertainty associated with the thematic layers' weights and rating of sub-classes (see Supplementary Fig. S5 ; Fig. S6 ; Tables S5–S7 ). This analysis denoted that the suitability map (output) used to describe the potential zones for GESE was highly influenced by GWS, followed by DGW, LULC, and DTR. These estimates exhibited a high consistency with the thematic layers’ derived weights.   3.2 Cost-benefit results of groundwater exploitation by solar energy (GESE) The GESE outputs were used to determine the best arrangement of the solar energy system in the study area, as previously reported (Gokcek, 2018 ). The simulation and optimization procedures using HOMER Pro (Table 2  ) depicted two economically feasible scenarios, i.e., Scenario (1) based only on PVS, and Scenario (2) dependent on a hybrid system of PVS + DPS for energy requirements. The findings of these two scenarios were compared with Scenario (3) using only conventional DPS (Othman, 2017 ). The economic calculations were performed for an ER range from 4.53 kWh/day (for pumping only at GWS <500 ppm) to 19.29 kWh/day (for pumping followed by RO desalination at GWS 500–5000 ppm). The pumping characteristics were Q = 20 m3 /hr and nw  = 8 hrs adopted to overcome any possible over-exploitation of the study area aquifer, following El Sabri and Salem (2016) . Saqr et al. (2023b)  also reported the drastic effects of groundwater over-exploitation on DGW, which should be overcome using regularized aquifer recharge and discharge patterns. The results in Table 2  revealed the benefits of applying scenarios (1) and (2) over scenario (3) to provide electricity for sustainable groundwater withdrawal, regarding different economic indicators, e.g., NPC, COE, and PBP. While PVS had higher capital costs, the NPC values for scenarios (1) and (2) reached 1700 and 1603 US$/kWh, respectively. These prices would almost be doubled under DPS adoption, probably due to the higher operating and maintenance costs associated with battery cracks and leaks, engine, and air and fuel filters. This observation was validated by Jones (2015) , employing different energy sources to pump brackish water desalination for agriculture. Their study demonstrated that the capital cost of PV (332335 $) was about twofold greater than DPS (153909 $); on the contrary, the operating and maintenance cost of DPS (31638 $/year) was higher than that of PV (16609 $/year) by almost 90%. Moreover, the proper solar radiation and land slope values of the selected area would facilitate the installation of the PV units without excessive operating expenditures, e.g., fuel costs (Nasir, 2019 ). Further, it was observed from the cost-benefit estimation in Table 2  that COE ranged from 0.22 to 0.25 US$/kWh for the PV-powered systems in both alternatives (1 and 2). In contrast, this economic indicator might reach 0.44 US$/kWh when implementing only DPS. The obtained COE agreed with previous studies (Saleem, 2012 ; Rutibabara, 2018 ) with similar energy source arrangements, showing the efficacy and profitability of solar and hybrid water systems. For instance, Rutibabara (2018)  reported that the COE was 0.289 US$/kWh by a hybrid system and increased to 0.367 US$/kWh by DPS for water pumping in Bugesera district, Rwanda. From Tables 2  and it is also clear that the PBP estimated values were ∼6.4 and 3.8 years for scenarios (1) and (2), respectively. Accordingly, the PBP of the PV-based system was shorter than the project's lifetime, i.e., 15 years, indicating that the initial investment could be recovered in a reasonable amount of time. In particular, this result demonstrated the viability of investing in solar-based projects for groundwater management within this time frame. In addition, the study findings were in line with those noted by Badari Narayana et al. (2013) , exhibiting a PBP = 9.33 years for a case study in Bangladesh depending on PVS application for water pumping. The HOMER Pro software forecasted that the yield of CO2  emitted by implementing DPS (Scenario_3) would be nearly 1.2 kg per 1 kWh while it could be negligible in scenario (1). Besides, scenario (1) would not cause any noise for residents, as previously reported (Ibrik, 2020 ). Regarding scenario (2), the amount of added CO2  to the environment due to the combustion process of the hybrid system (PVS + DPS) would be 0.33 kg/kWh with a reduction of 73% compared with standalone DPS installation. This assessment complied with that reported in the literature showing that the environmental effects were very critical for evaluating the PV project's feasibility. For example, Saleem (2012)  quantified the expected value of CO2  as 1.05 kg per 1 kWh, resulting from the DPS combustion process to pump water in the West Bank, Palestine. For small-scale desalination applications in Bozcaada Island, Turkey, CO2  pollution from hybrid systems (renewable and non-renewable sources) was reduced by about 75% compared with the conventional DPS system (Gokcek, 2018 ). Hence, the results in Table 2  depict that the solar-based energy systems have a great potential for achieving several techno-economic benefits compared with the DPS scenario. This finding was also supported by the data derived from the sensitivity analysis (see Supplementary Figs. S7–S9 ), allocating the notable places of groundwater resources in several areas worldwide within the water-energy nexus. In particular, the study results encourage the investment in PV technology for groundwater management in areas having comparable features to the “Most Suitable” zone of the study basin, reducing the NPC, CO2  emissions, and noise and having feasible PBP. The profitable outcomes associated with the investment in PV systems were further explored, regarding the three pillars of sustainability.  3.3 Meeting sustainable development goals (SDGs) through implementing photovoltaic systems (PVSs) and diesel power systems (DPSs) for groundwater exploitation by solar energy (GESE) The preset study revealed the effectiveness of applying GIS-based MCA and cost-benefit estimation to delineate the most suitable zones for the dual use of groundwater and solar energy. The study findings could be highly applicable in rural coastal areas worldwide, having comparable features to El-Saloum depression, Egypt. Many outcomes might be attained from this research study, including (i) a suitability map of GESE, and (ii) the financial profitability of adopting PV panels, as a source of clean energy, for groundwater management. Moreover, the research outcomes agree with the literature concerning the sustainable role of solar energy in finding solutions to mitigate the water scarcity problem in developing countries, e.g., Egypt (Schwerhoff and Sy, 2017 ). Besides, these outcomes might lead to significant linkages to SDGs targets: 3.3.1 Targets achievement by implementing PVS and DPS for GESE The achievement degree of the targets of each SDG by PVS in comparison with DPS is summarized (Fig. 5  a; see Supplementary Table S8 ): 3.3.1.1 SDG 1: No poverty Groundwater can be utilized as a main resource for implementing various cultivation and industrialization projects in undeveloped LULC regions. The local workers can be involved in these groundwater-related infrastructures, offering additional income, and raising the living standard of the poor. Both PVS and DPS can be used as energy sources for groundwater facilities’ operation and maintenance, increasing the percentage of individuals having secure rights to land and natural resources (Target 1.1 Eradicate extreme poverty ). As such, both PVS and DPS contribute equally to SDG1 with a percentage equal to 14.29%.  3.3.1.2 SDG 2: Zero hunger The contribution of PVS (25%) to this SDG is twofold greater than DPS (12.5%). Groundwater withdrawal can promote agriculture and grazing activities in the El-Saloum depression, Egypt, and other similar rural coastal areas worldwide. For instance, the desert areas of the LULC layer can be transformed into Greenlands through groundwater-fed irrigation systems powered by PVS or DPS. Different crops, trees, and vegetables can be cultivated in mild SL (e.g., <3°) lands based on either FW or BW. In addition, people can keep different types of livestock, for instance, to supply poultry foodstuff. Therefore, this situation of variety in food products can meet Target 2.1, Ensuring access to sufficient food . Achieving food security depending on the implementation of resilient agricultural practices can adapt to climate change. This property can be maintained by PVS green energy, positively contributing to Target 2.4 Ensure sustainable food production , especially for individuals in vulnerable situations.  3.3.1.3 SDG 3: Good health and well-being Equal contribution of both energy systems (PVS and DPS) exists in SDG3, i.e., 7.69%. Applying RO for groundwater treatment maintains good water quality with salinity below 500 ppm. Moreover, RO is an efficient technique used to remove multiple inorganic species and trace organic pollutants from groundwater. Accordingly, people located in a significant portion of the study area can get access to water free of hazardous contamination by integrating PVS to power small-scale RO units. Hence, human health could be maintained against water-borne diseases (Target 3.3 Decrease the number of diseases from water contamination ).  3.3.1.4 SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation Water security in remote areas can be achieved by either FW/BW pumping or BW desalination in different suitable zones (Maftouh et al., 2023 ). Groundwater withdrawal in these areas can be guaranteed at a low cost owing to the existence of acceptable GWS and reasonable DGW (∼12 m depth), supporting Target 6.1 Access to safe and affordable groundwater . Additionally, both PVS and DPS can supply energy for operating BW treatment equipment, removing faecal and priority chemical contamination. This benefit offers a high water quality for human consumption by protecting groundwater aquifers, complying with Target 6.6 Restore water-related ecosystems . This study also demonstrated the importance of renewable energy (i.e., PVS) application in ensuring sustainable groundwater withdrawals, highly contributing to Target 6.4 Addressing water scarcity . In particular, PVS linkage to SDG 6 fulfillment was 37.5%, which was reduced to 25% under DPS implementation.  3.3.1.5 SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy Applying PVS at steady SR values (5.41–5.62 kWh/m2 /day) and reasonable COE for groundwater management investment can endorse benefits to Target 7.1 Access to modern, reliable, and affordable energy . Moreover, ensuring green power and low-carbon energy systems for groundwater pumping causes a reduction in fossil fuel imports. Subsequently, this pattern would promote energy security, measured as US$ per ton CO2  avoided, to fulfill Target 7.2 Increase the share of renewable energy . Accordingly, PVS recorded a contribution percentage of 40% in comparison with 0% for DPS, regarding SDG7 fulfillment.  3.3.1.6 SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth The direct investment into agriculture and other economic sectors supports the farmers in implementing medium-sized irrigation areas. The current study also demonstrated that eco-innovation and creativity encourage the synergistic effects of renewable energy production and green finance, supporting the water–food–energy nexus. Moreover, groundwater can be available for industrial development, including manufacturing and cooling of thermal power plants. This financial benefit would offer many job opportunities, viz , Target 8.3 Promote new jobs and micro-sized businesses ; hence, PVS and DPS showed the same contribution (8.33%) to SDG8 fulfillment.  3.3.1.7 SDG 9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Green economic infrastructure (e.g., rainwater harvesting and storing in the aquifer) in the study area can be supported by the availability of groundwater and PVS energy. In parallel, industries regularly suffer from the common undesirable impact of incrustation and corrosion, representing the chemical reactions caused by inferior water quality. Hence, the study depicted an innovative source of energy that could be used to operate RO units for fluoride, hardness, and alkalinity removal from groundwater. This clean and environmentally sound technology can be used to construct food, wood, leather, and textile industries in the most suitable areas with short DTR (about 4 km near the road network), meeting Target 9.3 Access to small-scale industries .  3.3.1.8 SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities Individual homes can drill their wells to meet escalating water demand due to the insufficiency and irregularity of municipal water supply. Using PVS for this groundwater pumping and supply could mitigate the noise and pollution generated by DPS engines. Appropriate groundwater withdrawal could control and prevent disasters related to water bursts and mud bursts, providing safe and affordable housing. These drawbacks can occur from the interaction of groundwater (shallow water table) with the cement portion of the groundwork, weakening the entire foundation and thereby causing building failures. Hence, proper management of groundwater promotes people's settlement in safe and affordable residential buildings. Policymakers, planners, and administrators can share their responsibilities for implementing appropriate site-specific measures to improve groundwater management, meeting Target 11.b Enhance the conditions of cities through sustainable policies .  3.3.1.9 SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production PV water systems have verified reasonable values of economic indicators, e.g., NPC, COE, and PBP (see Table 2 ), promoting higher energy efficiency and longer lifetime. Consequently, the PVSs have become very competitive in harmonizing the carbon market and existing energy and climate policies when being installed within proper AS. Additionally, PVS implementation slows down the depletion of many natural resources, namely natural gas, oil, and coal, adding benefits to Target 12.2 Achieve the efficient use of natural resources .  3.3.1.10 SDG 13: Climate action GESE has several environmental merits on human health and climate change, positively contributing to Target 13.1 Fight against climate change . In particular, large amounts of CO2  can be emitted during fossil fuel combustion and DP generator utilization. CO2  is one of the greenhouse gases (GHG) constitutes and it is considered a primary contributor to global warming and other environmental hazards. Therefore, many countries have started to impose environmental taxes on fossil fuel users (consumers and producers), attempting to transform to green energies (Kelley et al., 2010 ). In particular, the contribution of PVS to SDG 13 fulfillment was equal to 20% due to minimizing the negative impact of carbon emissions on the atmosphere; however, this percentage was excluded under DPS implementation.  3.3.1.11 SDG 15: Life on land The PVS and DPS energy sources can be used for the planning and implementation of agro-reclamation activities on barren LULC. These activities could assist in restoring the farmlands affected by critical desertification status, i.e., Target 15.3 Combat desertification . Besides, the defined solar/groundwater suitability zones (see output suitability map in Fig. 4 h) are characterized by the threefold presence of developed land, potable water, and eco-friendly energy, maintaining the potential benefits of forest protection and restoration for groundwater recharge. Increasing the area of forest under sustainable forest management complies with Target 15.1 Ensure sustainable use of the water ecosystems . Accordingly, the contribution of DPS (8.33%) to SDG 15 is one-half that of PVS (16.67%).   3.3.2 Defining the three pillars of SDGs associated with PVS and DPS for GESE By defining the percentage share of each energy source toward a sustainable transition, SDGs achievements show higher linkages to PVS rather than DPS (Fig. 5 a). For instance, PVS implementation for groundwater exploitation can fulfill the attainment of most SDGs, mainly the goals related to clean energy (40%), safe and affordable water (38%), and zero hunger (25%). Using PVS could maintain an applicable framework for integrating sustainability performance into groundwater management. The synergetic effect of energy source/groundwater site selection on SDGs fulfillment could lead to many economic, environmental, and social-based benefits (Fig. 5 b). Referring to Fig. 5 b, PVS exhibits a contribution to the economic-related SDGs# 6, 9, 8, and 12, with a percentage of 15.38% compared with 10.26% for DPS. To illustrate, a PVS could provide a sustainable mean for water-related projects, such as brackish groundwater desalination facilities and infrastructures for aquifer protection (Nasir, 2019 ). Additionally, the existence of clean energy and affordable groundwater could help stakeholders in efficiently constructing industrial and agricultural activities that offer various green job opportunities. Following the economic profits, the present study highlighted the environmental benefits of solar energy utilization by sunbelt countries, e.g., Egypt. These countries also utilize clean electricity for water supply and distribution, shifting towards an environmentally friendly water-based management system (Schwerhoff and Sy, 2017 ). The contribution of PVS (22.73%) to the environmental-based SDGs# 7, 13, and 15 is about fivefold greater than DPS (4.55%), as demonstrated in Fig. 5 b. As a result, PVS introduces a clean source of energy with minimum deterioration (reduced aquatic and atmospheric pollution) to the environment. Besides, the mitigation of the desertification process in the study regions via groundwater-based projects supports the tackling of environmental-associated SDGs. From Fig. 5 b, using DPS to meet the energy demands for groundwater extraction could contribute to 7.89% of social-related SDGs#1, 2, 3, and 11. This percentage was improved to 13.16% by implementing PVS for groundwater management. This finding could be attributed to social acceptance toward the use of green energy for groundwater treatment by the RO membrane technology, owing to the reduction of CO2  emissions and the associated health concerns. Using groundwater in addition to other water resources (e.g., surface water, and brackishwater desalination) tends to ensure equal access to the rights of water services, achieving social equity (Abo Zaid, 2015 ). Moreover, creating new jobs in these brackish groundwater treatments and solar PV generation projects promotes the use of fairness and justice procedures in the distribution of public resources (solar and water). These patterns attempt to improve the social standards, regarding clean water, food security, and higher incomes for individuals.   3.4 Limitations and future research Based on the above feasible contributions of each energy source to SDGs achievement, the solar PVS would cover more three pillars of sustainability for groundwater management (Table 3  ). The significance of the current study is in providing a stepwise methodology for delineating suitable zones of GESE in rural coastal locations worldwide. Deriving the suitability maps using MCA and GIS could help stakeholders and decision-makers in their plans, regarding the development of different economic, environmental, and social activities (Al Garni and Awasthi, 2017 ). To enhance the accuracy of the proposed methodology, it is recommended to prepare high-resolution and large-scale input maps, i.e., thematic layers. Besides, the adoption of more layers, e.g., distance from cities, temperature, and distance from the power lines, is essential to test their effects on improving the spatial distribution of suitability maps. In addition, comparisons between the adopted MCA technique and other methods, e.g., ELimination Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to derive effective weights for the overlay analysis should be studied, as reported elsewhere (Akif Günen, 2021 ). Future research should also deal with how to reduce the high capital cost of PV systems. Moreover, a complete analysis and design of the pumping and/or desalination RO systems should be introduced (Rutibabara, 2018 ). In particular, a more thorough analysis on the selection of components, and specification of pumps is required. Furthermore, studies are advised to investigate the possibility of increasing the recovery of the RO desalination process to increase water productivity (Jones, 2015 ). The membrane types and configurations should be evaluated in comparison with other systems like the electrodialysis technique, getting the least cost of water treatment (Yousif, 2013 ). Questionnaires, surveys, and interviews should be performed to get a sufficient idea about the obstacles facing people in using renewable energies (Schwerhoff and Sy, 2017 ). The implementation of the aforementioned research points in the coming research studies would help in maintaining natural resources, e.g., water, land, and sun, in addition to lowering reliance on fossil fuels. The accomplishment of these investigations may inspire both the public and commercial sectors to invest in renewable clean energy, making it easier to achieve more SDGs.   4 Conclusions The current study succeeded in establishing a global protocol for the sustainable management of groundwater resources, aligning with the environmental, financial, and social aspects of the SDGs agenda. The potential zones of sustainable groundwater exploitation by solar energy (GESE) were adequately delineated using seven technical- and economic-related thematic layers of El-Saloum depression, Egypt. About 11.5% of the depression area was classified as “Most” suitable in the GESE output map highly influenced by groundwater salinity, depth to groundwater, and land use/land cover. Integrating photovoltaic systems (PVSs) into groundwater management could mitigate the drawbacks associated with conventional diesel power systems (DPSs), including air pollution (1.2 kg CO2 /kWh), high degree of noise, and unfeasible payback period. Consequently, multiple SDGs accompanied by job creation, climate change mitigation, and alleviation of stresses on food, water, land, and energy would be fulfilled. These benefits would maintain 22.7%, 15.4%, and 13.2% of environmental conservation, economic feasibility, and social acceptance, respectively, under the SDGs umbrella. To enhance the study results, future research is required to optimize the PVS (e.g., number of PV modules and tilt angle, and capacities of storage battery, inverter, and wind turbine) using advanced mathematical models.
