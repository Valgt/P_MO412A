                  The relationship between economy, transportation, and tourism has yet to be investigated for small heritage sites. In addition to more research into the elements mentioned above, there is still a need to establish an integrated model that answers the need for economic augmentation in such tourism destinations. The model uses a ‘choice freedom index’ with financial health and transportation infrastructure to forecast positive tourism supply and demand. This article combines ‘economy,’ ‘transportation,’ and ‘tourism’ in a constructed model that employs dynamic panel data regression, econometric modelling, and regression analysis, resulting in a user interface software that identifies future investment requirements to enhance tourism and applies it to Bishnupur, a city in the Indian subcontinent to address the Sustainable Development Goals – promoting economic growth and job creation (Goal 8), increase innovation, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and create resilient infrastructure (Goal 9), sustainable cities (Goal 11), as well as sustainable production and consumption (Goal 12).

In addition to more research into the elements mentioned above, there is still a need to establish an integrated model that answers the need for economic augmentation in such tourism destinations. The model uses a ‘choice freedom index’ with financial health and transportation infrastructure to forecast positive tourism supply and demand. This article combines ‘economy,’ ‘transportation,’ and ‘tourism’ in a constructed model that employs dynamic panel data regression, econometric modelling, and regression analysis, resulting in a user interface software that identifies future investment requirements to enhance tourism and applies it to Bishnupur, a city in the Indian subcontinent to address the Sustainable Development Goals – promoting economic growth and job creation (Goal 8), increase innovation, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and create resilient infrastructure (Goal 9), sustainable cities (Goal 11), as well as sustainable production and consumption (Goal 12).   Keywords City transportation  Sustainability  Indian subcontinent  Tourism assessment model  Dynamic panel data regression  Choice freedom index   Data availability I have attached the code in the manuscript.   1 Introduction The tourism and travel (T&T) industry has become a significant part of the economy, contributing 9.2 percent of India's GDP individually and 8.1 percent of its employment (WTTC, 2019 ). Globally, the T&T industry has contributed 10.4 percent of the global GDP whereas 10 percent of the worldwide employment as per 2018 research conducted by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). Every year, a substantial increase has been seen in international travel for tourism; meanwhile, 2019 arrivals have met the 2020 forecast through a 4 percent increase, which was 1.56 billion as per UNWTO's vision. Tourism travels worldwide is outpacing the global economy, proving the most sustainable and leading economic sector (UNWTO, 2020 ; UNWTO, 2019 ). While the T&T industry spreads globally, many communities and states generate revenue from heritage and cultural tourism. This exploitation of the heritage requires safeguarding and preserving the future of tangible heritage and material, the most critical factor for local development and human welfare (Alnafeesi, 2013 ). Domestic and regional tourism development factors sway the economic interest of a country. Cultural heritage facilitating rural and urban areas' regional development is a tool with growing utilization (Alberti and Giusti, 2012 ). Potential to intensify local or cultural landscape, domestic tourism, and travel prospects and uplift local, responsive icons to global attraction icons, making heritage conservation a crucial tool (Assari and Assari, 2012 ; Kastenholz et al., 2012 ). Multifaceted value systems mold the foundation of cultural and natural heritage notions. The concepts have evolved historically and spatially under diverse value systems (Keitsch, 2020 ; Swensen, 2012 ; Swensen and Jerpåsen, 2008 ). Cultural heritage is a symbolic character that subsidizes identity development and preservation; thus, various stakeholders recognize heritage values diversely (Tengberg et al., 2012 ; Tilley, 2006 ). Heritage, being an independent value, is still a substantially influential variable in numerous societal assemblages in a diverse equation networking cultural, economic, and social actions (Sairinen and Kumpulainen, 2006 ). The prospect of proprietorship conflicts with philosophies ascribed to heritage, and contradictory interests and values trigger an aggregate of disputes concerning values, meaning, and identity. Such doctrines and conflicts can convey equally positive and negative bearings, subsidizing sustainability, well-being, and community happenings through cultural heritage conservation development (Chen et al., 2021 ; Keitsch, 2020 ). Consequently, heritage conservation cannot be enforced, nor should evictions or restrictions intimidating the community come into play (Salafsky and Wollenberg, 2000 ). Developing a cultural heritage and social setting pertinence demonstrates the prospect of assimilating culture through emerging local and global policy threads (Loulanski, 2006 ). Even though such opportunities persist, concentrating on tangible heritage and moving towards cultural heritage inclusion as a focal trait for community and economic revitalization needs to be improved. The conventional amalgamation of distinct variables symbiotic with a cultural heritage like sustainability, tourism, community participation, and transportation is considered conservation (Mao et al., 2008 ). A comprehensive list of all the terminologies used throughout the study and their definitions and sources is provided in Table 1  . This study aims to develop a relationship between the ‘tourism,’ ‘transportation,’ and ‘economy’ sectors to forecast tourist arrival predictions for small heritage sites. The study utilizes the data of Bishnupur, India, to establish the developed model for integrated assessment of said heritage sites.  2 Research materials and methods The research concerned three sectors: heritage conservation, tourism, and transportation, requiring an extensive literature review. The review uses seventy-six research papers selected on critical elements, including ‘sustainability-tourism relationship,’ ‘transportation-tourism relationship,’ ‘conservation or heritage related to tourism,’ ‘economy-tourism relationship,’ and ‘community participation.’ The literature review from the papers identified the research gap, which was addressed through the proposed research and then verified using Bishnupur 2019-20 data. 2.1 Research questions 1. How does cultural heritage impact tourism-deprived heritage sites?  2. What is the correlation and significance of heritage in tourism upliftment in small heritage sites?  3. What is the contribution of transportation to tourism rejuvenation?  4. How does ‘transport model choice’ impact heritage tourism?  5. What is the relationship between ‘heritage,’ ‘transportation’ and ‘tourism'?  6. What factors affect heritage conservation and upliftment?  7. How do we integrate tourism and transportation in small heritage sites for positive tourism flow?     2.2 Research methodology The authors thoroughly analyzed six parameters: conservation or heritage management, transportation, sustainability, tourism, economy, and community participation for all selected research papers. The extensive review revealed the tools and techniques to engage each parameter fully. Further, these tools and techniques are evaluated for application to small conservation-deprived heritage sites for tourism and transportation development. Furthermore, gap analysis is conducted for the reliability of the available tools against proposed solutions for an integrated approach in the desired area. This gap helps design an integrated model for tourism flow calculation tested against a small heritage town, Bishnupur, for validation. The study first explores the gravity model, computable general equilibrium model, grid net space model, and multinomial logit model through a comprehensive literature review. Then, a Principal Component Analysis is used for factor analysis through a major extraction approach combined with maximum likelihood estimation. A supply and demand function analysis was explored next, as given by Albalate and Bel (2010) , followed by economic growth measurement function exploration in its initial form and after eliminating the time-invariant component and firm-specificity by Seetanah (2011) . The gravity model approach was chosen, and the econometric model provided by Khadaroo and Seetanah (2008)  was used. It was remodeled using the supply and demand function, made even simpler by including auto accessibility from the multinomial logit model referred to as the built environment variable by Asgari et al. (2017) , and further developed by using probability of mode choice for maximum likelihood estimation. The study then incorporated the choice freedom index for tourist freedom incorporation in the developed function to formulate the final integrated model for integrated assessment of the small heritage sites.   3 Literature review Heritage conservation has been a constant movement throughout the ages, from representing discontent with industrialization to its dislocation and transformations (Xie, 2006 ; Barthel, 1989 ). However, it has taken up different forms and processes under other societies, with two critical factors being pivotal, specifically social structure and mapping. Historic conservation is a component of a larger consciousness (Said et al., 2013 ; Barthel, 1989 ) amidst subtopic strategies including preservation, conservation and consolidation, restoration, reconstitution, reconstruction, replication, and adaptive reuse (Samadi and Yunus, 2012 ). Conservationists' selective communication of the past and measured control of the present aid in shaping the future social identity of people and places. While coming a long way to the values-based approach (Poulios, 2010 ), which does not include ‘living heritage sites', conservation approaches need a nudge over the board for better inclusive development of heritage sites (Seyedashrafi et al., 2017 ; Ismail, 2013 ). It includes tourism and transport infrastructural aid apart from technological development (Moropoulou et al., 2013 ) to induce non-destructive preservation techniques. The transportation industry has been a fundamental determinant in molding the tourism industry, providing an undeniable link between destination choice by tourists and transport efficiencies (Amiril et al., 2014 ; Prideaux, 2000 ). Transport and destination development conventionally upgrade heritage sites to deserving tourism through dependable access, better connectivity, and visit-worthy character. Researchers have prepared several representations to venture into the relationship between travel and tourism, especially to comprehend the flow of transport and its capacity for a solid spatial hierarchy of tourist flows, a subsidiary ingredient in rural and metropolitan destinations. (McKercher, Ho & Cros, 2005 ). Tourism flow models, like the gravity model, computable general equilibrium (C.G.E.) model, grid net space model, and multinomial logit model, are analyzed. It comprehends the implications and determinants of successful tourism flow in a destination, with city transportation providing the spine for the calculations (Nag and Sarkar, 2022 ). The gravity model approach (Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2008 ) evaluates the significance of city transportation infrastructure in ascertaining the tourism attractiveness of heritage sites (Refer to Fig. 1  ). The interpretation requires a panel data analysis of bilateral tourism flow. Tourism inflow into a heritage site varies with sensitivity to the origins and communities present. The gravity model explains several sorts of interregional and international flows. The model concerns a set of independent and dependent variables, including price variables, diverse characteristics of the destination and origin, origin-destination affiliation, and destination-specific and origin-specific variables. The gravity function is as follows (Adopted from Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2008 ),Equation 1 T R  o d t   = f ( G D P O  o t   , C P I  d t   , D I S T A N  o d   , T O U R I N F  d t   , R O A D  d t   , A I R  d t   , P O R T  d t   , P O P  o t   , L A N G  o d   , B O R D  o d   , P R O X  o d    )       The function relates income of origin (GDPO), relative prices (C.P.I.), distance (DISTAN), tourism infrastructure (TOURINF), road infrastructure (ROAD), air infrastructure (A.I.R.), number of ports (PORT), population (P.O.P.), common language (LANG), common border (BORD) and proximity (PROX) to tourist arrivals (T.R.). Research shows multi-collinearity as a non-serious issue upon pair-wise correlation using beta (β) as a vector parameter. Thus, the reduced form of the model produces an econometric model that is log-linear, as follows (Adopted from Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2008 ),Equation 2 t r  o d t   = α + β 1  g d p o  o t   + β 2  c p i  d t   + β 3  d i s t  o d   + β 4  t o u r i n f  d t   + β 5  r o a d  d t   + β 6  a i r  d t   + β 7  p o r t  d t   + β 8  p o p  o t   + β 9  l a n g  o d   + β 10  b o r d  o d   + β 11  p r o x  d t   + ε o d t        The obtainability of reliant, safe, and efficient traveling to comparatively unfamiliar tourist sites attracts tourist value. Since T&T is income and price-elastic, integrating transportation policies in tourism planning through better and more efficient infrastructure aids inbound and outbound tourism. Through ensuring sufficient incentives provision by the government, efficient institutional framework, regulatory and legislative can be developed, and superfluous practices and measures removed for better relationships amid tourism and transport capital (Kagan et al., 2018 ). The computable general equilibrium (C.G.E.) model (Van Truong and Shimizu, 2016 ) assesses the impact of transportation factors on tourism and the interaction between those mentioned above and economic elements. The research by Van Truong and Shimizu, 2016 ) demonstrates a positive exchange between the city's transportation accessibility factors and C.G.E. models as a fundamental element in impact assessment on tourism. Various other factors contribute to adequate destination accessibility. They include transportation modes, network connectivity, travel cost and affordability, mobility, integration within the transportation system of links and modes, transport demand, user info, mobility replacements, transport management, land use factor, travel activity prioritization, and inaccessibility or isolation values (Litman, 2008 ). These contribute to tourist destinations' economic success. Ever-changing transport modes and technologies contribute towards improved distance-travel competencies, travel time and speed, and comfort level. The C.G.E. model competently stimulates inter-relationships amid tourism, supplementary subdivisions of native economy, and effects of foreign makers and buyers for tourism analysis. The model can assist in quantifying actual policy effects, a useful analytic tool for economic scenario evaluation. The next-generation input-output (I.O.) model is well-represented by the C.G.E. model while treating transportation as a macroeconomic industry, quantifying monetary flow to comprehend equilibrium in supply and demand quantities related to tourism and heritage sites. The healthy supply of strengthened “pull factor” through harmonic interaction between elements upsurges tourist arrivals (Su and Lin, 2014 ). The changes in transportation can functionally affect the economic relationship of heritage sites, acting as a tool to promote tourism at the site. As in China, the grid net space model (Wang et al., 2012 ) explains the relative distance/travel time to net points to calculate tourism space. Tourism activities thrive by drawing in tourism system elements spatially and aggregately towards grid lines. The points integrate tourism functions, often ostracized or potentially disregarded in regional tourism growth. The multinomial Logit Model (Asgari et al., 2017 ) primarily concerns mode choice behaviour, particularly behavioural assimilation and neighbourhood effects. The future travel pattern depends on comprehending the implications of influences in city transportation decisions. These decisions have unexplored underlying factors and transferable impacts, which can cause switching to alternative modes. Cultural preferences are involved in these factors relating to social networks and lifestyle. These factors include spatial proximity and schedule compatibility (Blumenberg and Smart, 2014 ) and as-built environment (B.E.) variables (Refer to Table 2  ), including geographic and demographic aspects. The Principal Component Analysis (P.C.A.) is used for factor analysis through a major extraction approach. The model is developed for social/recreational trips, work, and shopping using maximum likelihood estimation through (Adopted from Asgari et al., 2017 ),Equation 3 L o g i t ( p )  = ln p 1 − p   = α + β 1   PR + β 2  H H + β 3  L U + β 4  L Q + β 5  I M + β 6  N H      The literature reviews on ‘tourism flow models' disclosed a prominent link between origin-destination, accessibility parameters, attractiveness factors, diversity amongst landuse-job-population, and spatial and tourism elements. Transportation is a broad thrust area with a close relationship with service providers, sustainability factors, and tourist experiences. Perceived authenticity can influence a historical or heritage tourism site. (Lu et al., 2016 ), Destination image and tourists' involvement are associated with tourist satisfaction. Open participation of tourists in local activities can positively affect related parameters. The competitiveness index of travel and tourism imparts knowledge through P.C.A. and bidirectional relationship analysis between tourism type and mode of transportation (Khan et al., 2017 ). Studies conducted by researchers so far, as per various sources, demonstrate P.C.A., Structural Equation Modelling (S.E.M.), and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (C.F.A.) as prominent modes of analysis in the field. The ever-increasing involvement of tourism in economic and social development has established mobility factors crucial for benefit facilitation in the city. Additional demand in mobility can often require service supply extension, but the local planners must confirm the same or produce alternatives (Albalate and Bel, 2010 ). The demand-enhancing factors include tourism intensity, service pressure, supply constraints, and external costs on resident users. Economic success and social dynamism are the results of positive factor assessment. It contributes to the assimilation and neutralization of significant negative local externalities. As per Albalate and Bel (2010) , assessment requires data on social and economic attributes and heterogeneous institutional frameworks including G.D.P. per capita, density (DENS), price, average operating cost (OCOST), the fleet of various vehicles (FLEET=Buses, Metro, Tram), dummy variable on specific characteristics of capital (Capital), in-vehicle service quality associated to speed (PUB_SPEED), motorization (MOTOR) and tourism intensity (TOUR). (Adopted from Albalate and Bel, 2010 ), (Adopted from Albalate and Bel, 2010 )Equation 4 S u p p l y  i  = ln  ( p l a c e − k m  p o p u l a t i o n   )  i  = α + β 1   log ( G D P  i  )  + β 2   ln ( D E N S  i  )  + β 3   ln ( P R I C E  i  )  + β 4  O C O S T  i  + β 5  B U S E S  i  + β 6  M E T R O  i  + β 7  T R A M  i  + β 8  D i c a p i t a l   + β 9  T O U R  i  + ε 1      Equation 5 D e m a n d  i  = ln ( p a s s e n g e r − k m  p o p u l a t i o n   )  i    = δ + γ 1   ln ( G D P  i  )  + γ 2   ln ( D E N S  i  )  + γ 3   ln ( P R I C E  i  )  + γ 4   ln ( P U B S P E E D    i  )  + γ 5   ln ( M O T O R  i  )  + γ 6   ln ( B U S E S  i  )  + γ 7   ln ( M E T R O  i  )  + γ 8   ln ( T R A M  i  )  + γ 9  D i c a p i t a l   + γ 10  T O U R  i  + ε 2       A cluster analysis using an econometric strategy can encompass various methods and algorithms through similarity grouping using maximal association degrees between variables. The association is often cross-evaluated through a covariance matrix. Public transit can aid in making the variables less related to demand-enhancing factors and contribute towards better transit and tourism relationships. Dynamic panel data regression followed by econometric modelling and regression analysis are generalized methods for variable and significance estimators (Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2007 ; Lim, 1997 ). Although transportation and tourism are closely related, they are not issues-free (Lohmann and Duval, 2014 ). Every city has its challenges contributing to the problems. The problems can include the quality of public transit service, lack of symbiotic co-relationships among leisure facilities and transport providers, and long-term adverse effects of transportation on sustainability and accessibility. A city has to make a considerable commitment to land use, the massive influx of resources, and long-term investments in sustainable transportation infrastructure to avoid negative impacts on social dislocation and the environment (Amiril et al., 2014 ). Studies in the past have clustered critical sustainability factors as economic, environmental, engineering, community engagement, social, relationship management, institutional sustainability, resource utilization and management, project management, and health and safety. These factors formulate a guideline for tourism-transportation projects. For instance, South Tyrol's tourism-transport system and sustainability (Brida et al., 2014 ) disclosed that sustainable transit modes' access to remote and environmentally sensitive areas fostered regional competitiveness. The economic efficiency is impacted by variations in seasonal patterns of tourism flows – unimodal distribution and bimodal seasonal distribution. Another instance is Lanzarote Island's tourism-transport-ecology relationship, where road transport is evaluated for sustainable tourism development (Martín-Cejas and Sánchez, 2010 ). The review showed that the lack of integration of transport planning into tourism policy causes stagnation or decline. Urban communities and areas play a vital role in sustainability determination. The urban area assessment enables decision-making by comparing municipalities and urban areas (Centobelli et al., 2017 ; Haapio, 2012 ). The assessment tools include.1. Natural environment  2. Local community contribution  3. Social infrastructure  4. Service functions  5. Place shaping  6. Transportation  7. Smart linkage  8. Neighbourhood pattern and design  9. Regional priority    Other urban community and area assessment determinants are local community and social inclusion, historical identity of cultural heritage, conservation, cultural and natural assets use, social infrastructure formation, and cultural practices (Ameen et al., 2015 ; Haapio, 2012 ). However, the assessment was recently developed on the Urban Development Sustainability Assessment Model (UD-SAM) (Xing et al., 2009 ) to identify sustainability indicators. For instance, the Okavango Delta tourism development review (Mbaiwa, 2003 ) for socio-economic and environmental impacts demonstrated that tourism development has brought about infrastructure and service upliftment. The businesses and community have backward linkages to the tourism industry and forward links to employment and opportunities for local communities (Jimura, 2011 ). Although connections are clearly defined, input-output analysis can evaluate indirect effects (Lenzen et al., 2003 ). The repercussions of a reaction in final demand require input-output analysis for better neutralization and development (Fletcher, 1989 ; Dans and González, 2018 ) (Refer to Fig. 2  ). Heritage conservation and its links to sustainable urban development (SUD) are also concerns. Cultural heritage positioning forms a significant part of the urban resource and broader correlation amidst two turfs to quantify the effectiveness of contemporary practices holistically. (Guzmán et al., 2017 ) Culture is perceived as capital in urban competitiveness. Social transformation on multiple levels (Kagan et al., 2018 ) can help perceive culture or heritage as.1. Prerequisite for social change through central-value-system  2. Producer of “creativity, engagement, and projection."  3. The social challenge to cultural diversity and multi-ethnicity.    Heritage conservation and tourism intertwine with sustainability on adaptive reuse. The concerned aspects include social inclusiveness, accessibility, the establishment of a feeling of identity and place, the continual local communal life, and the supportiveness of government policies and strategies (Yung and Chan, 2012 ; Tweed and Sutherland, 2007 ). For instance, the cultural heritage and its sustainability in Southwest England (Howard and Pinder, 2003 ) identified a disproportionate preference for one heritage, reflecting institutional dominance. Another similar instance is the Cultural Heritage and Urban Development (CHUD) project in Saida, Lebanon (Al-hagla, 2010 ), where it is observed that cultural heritage motivates cultural tourism. The bottom-up and actor-cantered approaches have ‘interaction’ as a critical tool. The heritage area needs to balance multiple needs to justify sustainable development. Interaction as a tool has taken the form of community participation, a critical issue in heritage management (García, 2018 ). The core community, dwellers within or close to heritage properties, are cultural custodians and associated users. The core community is not accustomed to managing their daily lives and associating local heritage with overall living space improvement, but the loss of heritage management occurs under rapid urbanization (Li et al., 2020 ). The top-down approach in cultural heritage management through community engagement is insufficient in the centralized, profit-driven decision-making process. Thus, the process takes place in 3 steps: context identification, strategy development programming, and action management by execution. (Veldpaus, Pereira Roder & Colenbrander, 2013 ) Community participation as a critical tool depends on community identification and proper active participatory methods selection. Experts' co-mapping of cultural heritage is an effective method to engage with locals. International approaches are currently involved in the public participatory process to integrate cultural heritage management with local SUD. For instance, ICOMOS China has joined forces with the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) for a centralized approach towards heritage management as the urban features of the cultural area need to be preserved (Li et al., 2016 , 2020 ). The collaboration practices benefit the region regarding tangible heritage protection and traditional lifestyle preservation and help the residents economically. Another such instance is the cultural landscape with cultural heritage values in the Jianan Irrigation System, Taiwan, and similar evidence from Ghana and Burkina Faso is perceived as a significant conservation and preservation point for the community's longevity and values (Wang, 2020 ; Pouliot and Treue, 2013 ). Community participation is also vital to tourism development and essential for SUD of W.H.S. (Rasoolimanesh and Jaafar, 2016 ). Reviving and sustaining W.H.S. is a significant role performed by core communities. Community participation shapes itself as per the circumstance of the destination. It is crucial for decision-making, economic involvement, and destination promotion at the lowest level (Henderson, 2000 ). The rural W.H.S. conservation for tourism development improves the sense of belongingness, local area value appreciation and understanding, and social network development. Tourism development and heritage management have identified three types of community participation: induced, coercive, and spontaneous. These are also contingent upon various factors that determine the level of involvement. (Rasoolimanesh and Jaafar, 2016 ). These factors are stakeholder collaboration, cultural, structural, or political barriers in a collaborative approach, and the type of tourism activities present and desired. Proper incorporation of dialogue, cooperation, and stakeholder collaboration is required to assimilate tourism development in heritage conservation to minimize any threat (Aas et al., 2005 ). The commodification of culture must be addressed to have widespread collaboration and participation. The UNESCO project “Cultural Heritage Management and Tourism: Models for Cooperation among Stakeholders” for Luang Prabang aligned with the local Agenda 21 strategy to create and implement action plans for community-level heritage and sustainable tourism management (Aas et al., 2005 ). The community engagement model based on Participatory Action Research determines the approach to be taken by policymakers and planners at the grassroots level (García, 2018 ). The economic aspect of heritage and tourism management is a vital angle for integrated development. The conventional sources of economic growth include a measure of the openness of the economy (XMGDP), investment in physical capital (IVTGDP), and human capital (S.E.R.) as per the augmented Solow growth model based on earlier growth studies principles (Seetanah, 2011 ). The model is reduced by Seetanah (2011)  by including a proxy for tourism development (TOUR) and economic freedom (E.F.), giving the resulting form – (Adopted from Seetanah, 2011 )Equation 6 Y = f ( I V T G D P , X M G D P , S E R , E F , T O U R  )       The possibility of financial freedom is necessary for economic growth, which is measured through the Economic Freedom Index E.F. (Seetanah, 2011 ). Through natural algorithm implying the double log-linear condition of variables developed, the following econometric specification– (Adopted from Seetanah, 2011 )Equation 7 y 0  = β 0  + β 1  i v t g d p  i t   + β 2  x m g d p  i t   + β 3  s e r  i t   + β 4  E F  i t   + β 5  t o u r  i t   + ε i t        After the assimilation of dynamics into the above model, the following A.R. model is developed – (Adopted from Seetanah, 2011 ), (Adopted from Seetanah, 2011 )Equation 8 y i t   − y i t − 1   = α t  + v y  i t − 1   + β x  i t   + μ i  + ε i t       Equation 9 y i t   = α t  + ( ϑ + 1  )  y i t − 1   + β x  i t   + u i  + ε i t        The overhead can also be written in first differences, eliminating the time-invariant component and firm-specific μi  (Adopted from Seetanah, 2011 ).Equation 10 Δ y  i t   = Δ α  t  + ( v + 1  )  Δ y  i t − 1   + β Δ x  i t   + Δ ε  i t        The casual relationship between tourism spending and economic growth forms the basis for policymakers' policies and related concerns (Chou, 2013 ). By 2011, tourism singularly funded 9 percent of the global GDP of over US$10 trillion and 255 million jobs. Since tourism contributes towards economic activity generation, it causes speedy growth of domestic income and government revenues, inducing a multiplier effect. Increments progress the equilibrium of payment and evolution in tourism-promoting government policies. The heterogeneity of communities and their social-cultural backgrounds cause differences in economic conditions. Their cooperation or competition creates dependency. Although such sides of the tourism-economy relationship exist, the political-economic benefit side of tourism persuades governments to increase tourism development (Chou, 2013 ). Econometric modelling and dynamic analysis are not the only ways to analyze the economic and tourism relationship. Unit root and panel cointegration are also available tools in the market (Lee and Chang, 2008 ). The Granger causality approach to examine the causal relationship between tourism and economic development has been applied in numerous works of literature. The test, however, is restricted by the following problems –• Whether or not the yearly data are sufficient to represent the long-term relationship between the two.  • The inability of the annual data to eliminate the problems of short-term fluctuations due to business cycles and structural change and  • The failure to delineate countries with unique features in different causal relationships.    These complications require a nonlinear approach to integrating economy and tourism through threshold variables (Po and Huang, 2008 ). A spatial correlation in labour market sharing and knowledge spillover exists for the inter-regional flow of tourism practitioners and learning, paving the way for tourism product creation (Ma et al., 2015 ). Tourism growth cluster effects expand the economic gap amongst community clusters and need an integrated nonlinear approach. The focal point for development, cities, are providers of heritage asset concentrations, infrastructural amenities, etc., based on economic resources. The conservation and management of heritage assets improve the potential for income-earning opportunities, city competitiveness, and liveability apart from mere historic significance preservation. (García-Hernández et al., 2017 ; Ebbe, 2009 ). The economic aspect of tourism and heritage management has been explored in numerous earlier studies, and few have explored destination competitiveness and governance perspectives on a comparative global scale. For instance, Wang and Bramwell (2012)  discuss the political-economic aspect and governance perspective of Hangzhou, China, through prioritizing heritage protection and tourism development. They discuss the importance of government intervention in heritage sites to develop tourism and heritage management. In broad political and economic circumstances, policy-making holds a critical position through ample power and influence over various actors in schemes' governance and policy choice's strategic selectivity. Other instances are seen in the paper by Andrades and Dimanche (2017)  which explores Russia's issues and challenges in the context of destination competitiveness and tourism development. The destination competitiveness model by TTCI (Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index) includes human resources and labour market, air transport infrastructure, tourists' service infrastructure, prioritization of travel and tourism, business environment, price competitiveness, I.C.T. readiness, safety and security, international openness, environmental sustainability, cultural resources, natural resources, and business travel as well as ground and port infrastructure. Destination competitiveness fostering is strengthened by solid planning, effective policies, and employment of sustainability criteria. It needs stability in the long-run relationship between economic growth and tourism development, which can be imbalanced through structural breaks (Lee and Chien, 2008 ). The international and cross-strait political changes, relaxing of some tourism policies and control, and commencement of economic shocks break down the stability of this relationship. Chen and Chiou-Wei (2009)  examine this type of relationship in Taiwan through a tourism-led economic growth hypothesis and in South Korea through a reciprocal causal relationship approach. They analyzed using an EGARCH-M model with improbability factors while identifying the significance of the uncertainty factors. Similarly, Dogru & Bulut (2018) , identified a bidirectional causality amidst economic and tourism-oriented growth. They suggested their interdependency and a directly proportional stimulation relationship. The micro-level transformation of the economy for a circular economic approach is required, which can benefit the heritage management and adaptive reuse aspects of cultural heritage buildings by reducing any environmental impacts occurring in the course of time (Foster, 2020 ). 3.1 Synthesis of literature review Analyzing the seventy-six research papers on the selected parameters enlightened a distinctive tool and technique selection pattern unique to each parameter and their combinations. Numerous analysis methods and tools are identified in the evaluation and review. The four tourism flow models studied in the literature review showed the application of Principle Component Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, dynamic data regression analysis, and others (Refer to Table 3  ). Although many methods and tools are identified through a comprehensive study, a universal tool and technique dealing with all the selected parameters need to be improved. Moreover, heritage tourism or general equations did not introduce small conservation-deprived heritage sites. The six parameters were compared against each other to understand the most critical parameter in the study. A.H.P. method is used for making decisions for parameter prioritization and selection. The model used a set of weighted criteria to score the parameters and create a pair-wise comparison through the reviewed research papers' importance. It provided an all-inclusive and rational framework for configuring a decision problem, demonstrating and computing its elements, linking them to general goals, and estimating substitute solutions. The C.R. value of the resultant was 8.2 percent, which was within the acceptable range of being below 10 percent through 15 comparisons conducted. The total variance explained by the principal component ‘tourism’ is high and, therefore, good. The resulting weights are based on the principal eigenvector of the decision matrix. Tourism ranked first with 45.2 percent priority over transportation with 28.2 percent priority. Similarly, sustainability, community participation, conservation or heritage management, and economy followed the trend with principal eigenvalue 6.514, 6 iterations in eigenvector solution with delta 2.9E-8. The review showed that input-output analysis was prominent in studying four parameters: economy, tourism, transportation, and sustainability. A bottom-up approach was considered for conservation or heritage management and community participation (Refer to Table 4  ). The gravity model approach is close to the study's objective for tourism and transportation upliftment of tourism sites. The analysis adopted for this approach includes dynamic panel data regression, econometric modelling, and regression analysis. Apart from the above-mentioned, conservation and rehabilitation practices from ICOMOS and A.S.I. are majorly seen across conservation and heritage management research papers along with life-cycle assessments. These tools and techniques were finally selected for further analysis to uplift small conservation-deprived heritage sites. The comprehensive study of various literature works across fields contributes to the basic understanding of the determined parameters for the research. They help understand the inter-sectoral dependencies of multiple parameters and other uncertainties or variables while evaluating an integrated tourism model for a heritage site through a transportation and conservational approach. The research concluded that numerous works of literature are available for selected sectors. Still, an integrated model that meets the requirements of a common heritage site of a minor nature has yet to be made available. It calls for creating a new or improved model to assess small heritage sites on transportation, tourism, and heritage management parameters while incorporating their sustainability and economic development through a community participatory approach at the grassroots level at a global scale. A thorough review of existing literature and models on tourism and its contributors showed that the models need more small conservation sites. They also need a unified model to access tourism, its economic contributors, and its transportation side. Thus, an integrated universal model is developed to counteract the deficiencies and deliver a more useable tourism-transportation-economy model. The defects analyzed helped create the final model by replacing all motor or vehicular factors (as well as FLEET) with mobilization (MOBodt ) in Equations (2), (4) and (5) . Small heritage sites might have only some commute options available, thus getting equations (11)–(13) , respectively (Adopted from Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2008  and modified by the authors).Equation 11 t r  o d t   = α + β 1  g d p o  o t   + β 2  c p i  d t   + β 3  d i s t  o d   + β 4  t o u r i n f  d t   + β x  M O B  o d t   + β 8  p o p  o t   + β 9  l a n g  o d   + β 10  b o r d  o d   + β 11  p r o x  d t   + ε o d t        Since the model aims to forecast positive tourism, tourism supply and demand are essential. The mobility factor is reconsidered in the equations above. (Adopted from Albalate and Bel, 2010  and modified by the authors), (Adopted from Albalate and Bel, 2010  and modified by the authors)Equation 12 S u p p l y = α + β 1   log ( G D P  i  )  + β 2   ln ( D E N S  i  )  + β 3   ln ( P R I C E  i  )  + β 4  O C O S T  i  + β x  M O B  o d t   + β 8  D i c a p i t a l   + β 9  T O U R  i  + ε 1      Equation 13 D e m a n d = δ + γ 1   ln ( G D P  i  )  + γ 2   ln ( D E N S  i  )  + γ 3   ln ( P R I C E  i  )  + γ 4   ln ( P U B S P E E D    i  )  + γ x  M O B  o d t   + γ 9  D i c a p i t a l   + γ 10  T O U R  i  + ε 2       Considering for positive tourism, Supply – Demand >0 is true. We get,Equation 14 0 < α − δ + β 1   log  ( G D P  i  )  − γ 1   ln ( G D P  i  )  + ln ( D E N S  i  )  ( β 2  − γ 2  )  + ln ( P R I C E  i  )  ( β 3  − γ 3  )  + M O B  o d t   ( β x  − γ x  )  + D i c a p i t a l   ( β 9  − γ 9  )  + T O U R  i  ( β 9  − γ 10  )  + ( ε 1  − ε 2  )  + γ 4   ln  ( P U B  S P E E D i   )  + β 4  O C O S T  i       (Source: Authors) Considering,β a  − γ a  = Z a − a   = Z 0      Equation 15 0 < ( α − δ  )  + β 1   log ( G D P  I  )  − γ 1   ln ( G D P  i  )  + Z 0   ln ( D E N S  i  )  + Z 0   ln ( P R I C E  i  )  + Z 0  ( M O B  o d t   )  + Z − 1   D i c a p i t a l   + Z − 1   ( T O U R  i  )  + ( ε 1  − ε 2   )  + γ 4   ln  ( P U B  S P E E D i   )  + β 4  O C O S T  i  = 0 < ( α − δ  )  + β 1   log ( G D P  I  )  − γ 1   ln ( G D P  i  )  + Z 0  { ln ( D E N S  i  )  + ln ( P R I C E  i  )  + ( M O B  o d t   )  } + Z − 1   { D  i c a p i t a l   + ( T O U R  i  )  } + ( ε 1  − ε 2   )  + γ 4   ln  ( P U B  S P E E D i   )  + β 4  O C O S T  i       (Source: Authors) Replacing variables containing dens, price, and the mob with auto accessibility and replacing variables containing the capital, tour, G.D.P. with Δ y i t      from equation (10)  in equation (15) , we get,Equation 16 0 < ( α − δ  )  − ∑ j = 1  N  E m p  j  * f ( d )  i j   + Δ y i t   + ( ε 1  − ε 2   )  + γ 4   ln  ( P U B  S P E E D i   )  + β 4  O C O S T  i       (Source: Authors) Now, taking equation (3)  and replacing α with it in equation (16) , we get,Equation 17 0 < ( ln p 1 − p   − β 1   PR + β 2  H H + β 3  L U + β 4  L Q + β 5  I M + β 6  N H − δ )  − ∑ j = 1  N  E m p  j  * f ( d )  i j   + Δ y i t   + ( ε 1  − ε 2   )  + γ 4   ln  ( P U B  S P E E D i   )  + β 4  O C O S T  i       (Source: Authors) The above formula represents an integrated form of the existing equations on tourism but still needs the freedom index of location choice. Thus, a variable representing the choice index is required. Considering the “choice freedom index” as “CFIodt ” for all the origin-destination options, considering the varying time spent by each tourist as per their specific choice and time spent on each site in equation (17) , we get the following equation,Equation 18 0 < ( ln p 1 − p   − β 1   PR + β 2  H H + β 3  L U + β 4  L Q + β 5  I M + β 6  N H − δ )  − ∑ j = 1  N  E m p  j  * f ( d )  i j   + Δ y i t   + ( ε 1  − ε 2   )  + γ 4   ln ( P U B  S P E E D i   )  + β 4  O C O S T  i  + C F I  o d t        (Source: Authors) Finally, for a small heritage site to have positive tourism, equation (18)  should suffice. The model assesses the importance of transportation infrastructure in determining the tourism appeal of cultural sites. The gravity model explains several types of interregional and worldwide fluxes. The model is concerned with a set of independent and dependent variables. In small heritage towns, the model and analysis methodologies aid in establishing beneficial outcomes in the tourist, transportation, and economic development sectors. The integrated evaluation aids in developing a better-integrated solution to be included in the study proposal phase, hence improving the encountered challenges. The tool aids in analyzing similar concerns and the induction of positive tourism in heritage cities, strengthening the need for conservation and management.   4 Case study – Bishnupur Bishnupur is a city and a municipality of the Bankura district located in the Indian subcontinent. It is the headquarters of the Bishnupur subdivision, West Bengal, India. It is famous for its terracotta temples built by the Malla rulers, Shree Krishna Raasleela, and the Baluchari sarees. Bishnupur temples were submitted by the Archaeological Survey of India on July 03, 1998 in the “Cultural” category for consideration as a UNESCO heritage site. Bishnupur, the temple town, is a paradise for terracotta temple architecture built between the 16th and 19th centuries. Bishnupur has a rich history and has a glorious past. It was the capital of the Mallabhum Kingdom in the 7th century, founded by Adi-Malla alias Raghunath and the Malla dynasty's founder. Bishnupur rose to its peak of glory under Bir Hambir's rule, the 49th king of the Mallabhum dynasty. Bishnupur's past was enriched by its rich architecture, music, and handicrafts, including weaving and pottery. Its unique style of architecture was a combination of brilliance and detailed terracotta work, which has withstood the ravages of time, glorifying Eastern India. During the Malla dynasty, the Malla king patronized handlooms and cottage industries. For instance, Dashabatar card making, scented Amburi tobacco, conch shell, silk weaving, patachitra, brass metal, terracotta temples, and Baluchari saree hand-looming and dokra handicrafts (Nag, 2022 ). It lies just south of the Dhaleshwari (Dhalkisor) river and has the potential cultural identity and possibility to grow itself as a cultural tourist center. Being located at 23°05′N 87°19′E, it has an average elevation of 194 feet (59m). The area has fertile, low-lying alluvial plains. It is a predominantly rural area, with 90.06% of the population living in rural areas and only 8.94% living in urban areas (Refer to Fig. 3  , Fig. 4   and Table 5  ).• Area = 22.02 sq. km  • Population = 67,783    Several such temples stand testimony to the exquisite artistry of the crafts workers of the region. The temples were fashioned from native laterite and brick covered with terracotta tiles depicting scenes from the epic Mahabharata. The temples are located in Bishnupur and through various other minor settlements in the district of Bankura. Bishnupur has 32 heritage sites (20 by ASI Kolkata, nine are recognized by UNESCO, and the Municipal Corporation identifies the remaining 12), among which five are non-structural. The last recorded conservation status of these 32 sites is that only five were conserved in 1913 (15.63%), 13 in 1914 (40.63%), amongst which only 1 had a follow-up in 2010 (0.08%), 1 in 1927 (3.13%) and 1 in 1931 (3.13%), with 12 never having been conserved (37.48%). The lack of follow-ups by the ASI and the Municipal Corporation for conservation makes it convenient for model testing. Also, it labels it as a small conservation-deprived heritage town. Moreover, Bishnupur only has well-linked road access and needs the means of transport by air and rail, which needs to be accessed from a different location far from the city's vicinity. The closest airport to Bankura is Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, Kolkata, about 212 km from Bankura. To avail of a train, one has to go to Kolkata. The accessibility of the town is represented by figures developed through ArcGIS 3-D City Engine (Refer to Figs. 5 and 6   ).  5 Model application for Bishnupur We are establishing the baseline with existing values in the gravity model to compare the expected model's result using dummy beta data (taken as 0.5 for maximum neutrality) and 2011 variable data (obtained from the Bankura Human Development Report and District Census Handbook given in the Govt. of India Census Data Website). Apart from this, tourist travel behaviour was captured using a questionnaire survey of 272 Bishnupur local tourists through stratified random sampling (calculated using the sample size formula, Sample Size = [X2 NP (1-P)/D2 (N-1) + X2 P (1-P)], with 90% confidence level, 50% distribution and degree of accuracy as 0.05%). Tourist behaviour in surrounding areas was also captured to understand the tourism pattern in the area with a sample size of 1270 through a general travel survey—the collected data aids in predicting CFI for the area.

Supply-Demand = −66504. Therefore, the present tourism models have had a negative impact. For the tourism models to have a positive impact or result, they have to have a holistic approach, as discussed in the developed integrated model, which can pave the path for its achievement. Projecting Supply-Demand through the integrated model developed using numerous variables unlisted in individual tourism models, as discussed in the research review section, will help get a holistic view of the tourism situation in a city.Equation 19 0 < ( ln p 1 − p   − β 1   PR + β 2  H H + β 3  L U + β 4  L Q + β 5  I M + β 6  N H − δ )  − ∑ j = 1  N  E m p  j  * f ( d )  i j   + Δ y i t   + ( ε 1  − ε 2   )  + γ 4   ln ( P U B  S P E E D i   )  + β 4  O C O S T  i  + C F I  o d t      0 < ( ln 0.5 1 − 0.5   − ( 0.5 * 0.753 )  + ( 0.5 * 15063 )  + ( 0.5 * 1.333 )  + ( 0.5 * 1 )  + ( 0.5 * 0.71 )  + ( 0.5 * 0.95 )  − δ )  − ∑ j = 1  N  E m p  j  * f ( d )  i j   + Δ y i t   − 66620.81 − α − δ + ( 0.5 * ln ( 50 )  )  + ( 0.5 * 250 )  + C F I  o d t      0 < 7533.12 − ∑ j = 1  1  25335 * 1 + Δ y i t   − 66620.81 − α − 2 δ + ( 0.5 * ln ( 50 )  )  + ( 0.5 * 250 )  + C F I  o d t      0 < − 84295.73 + Δ y i t   − α − 2 δ + C F I  o d t      C F I  o d t   > 84295.73 − Δ y i t   + α + 2 δ > 0    C F I  o d t   > 84295.73 − l o g G D P + α + 2 δ > 0    C F I  o d t   > 84295.73 − log  4450 + α + 2 δ > 0    C F I  o d t   > 84292.08 + α + 2 δ > 0                   (Source: Authors) Every city or town must define its own CFI per the city's type and tier for a positive impact. Equation (19)  describes the CFI requirement for the studied area – Bishnupur. The case study deals with an integrated approach to uplift tourism in small heritage towns. The model developed has a holistic approach and defines a universal front for tourism evaluation in a city. As per the developed model, Bishnupur's CFI needs to be greater than 84292.08 + α + 2 δ    to induce positive tourism. Apart from tourism analysis, the model aids in considering the economic contribution of tourism to a place. Since the model incorporates variables like GDP and the operating cost of tourism sites, it facilitates calculating the total economy lost due to negative tourism. Nonetheless, this then aids in manipulating the fares accordingly to adjust the potential lost income of the local community for a better economic developmental drive. The model has been converted into a user-friendly interface to help the governing bodies and the citizens alike check their tourism impact and project it using the ‘choice freedom index’ to find the accurate tourism flow. Thus helping understand the variables individually for a better-resulting tourism flow. The developed user interface can be accessed using https://integrated-tourism-prediction.netlify.app/ . 5.1 User interface detailing The code was developed to create the user interface (Refer to Appendix A ). The software helps analyze small heritage sites once variable data is put into the required fields once prompted. The code initially calculates the tourism arrivals through the gravity model approach, then proceeds toward supply and demand calculation, succeeded by tourism requirement prediction calculation through the developed integrated model for comparison with the gravity model output and predict the negative-yielding variables to be influenced to generate desired results.   6 Model – sensitivity analysis Based on the assumption that “tourism arrivals” and “supply-demand” projected by the gravity model approach are valid only when deviation is below or above the ‘anticipated-5000’ or 20%, the model determines its requirement based on the demand for tourism in the small heritage site. In contrast, if the model correctly predicts the negative class but agrees with the gravity model yield due to its proximity to the yielded value or being below 20%, the result is classified as true negative. If the prediction of the gravity model crosses the limit of ‘-5000’ or 20%, the result is classified as true positive as it was predicted to be more deviated, and the result yields the same. Other results that differ from the presumption mentioned above will be categorized as false negative and false positive, respectively. Data from five small Indian heritage towns—Bishnupur, Mandawa, Nenmeni, Pathanamthitta, and Mananthavady—were used to test this notion. The model testing for the proposed integrated model and the gravity model technique is shown in Table 6  . The “percentage of divergence from gravity model” sensitivity classification is also carried out. Four true positives and one true negative were obtained from the sensitivity classification. In order to understand the model's sensitivity, specificity, precision, error rate, and accuracy, a confusion matrix measurement has been carried out. The measurement of the fundamental confusion matrix measures is shown in Table 7  .  7 Result and discussion Cultural heritage has been a crucial contributor to tourism over the years. However, sites with conservation-deprived heritage have been experiencing troubles in generating tourism and have a combination of different problems causing an overall degradation of these sites. Small heritage sites have been the most overlooked ones in this competitive race of tourism upliftment due to their scale and lack of numerous services, making them obsolete in this ever-changing, ever-advancing industry. The correlation between heritage and tourism has been high, as explored by the various works of literature, but their significance has been low and unexplored for small heritage sites. Although not all areas explored are of a heritage nature, almost all have a common transportation problem, some less and some with a more complex character. Any site with a strong tourism network flowing and breathing through them must have a substantially robust transit model and mode choice behaviour to accumulate the site's residential and floating traffic. Small heritage sites are no different; they have numerous transit-oriented issues and sometimes lack opportunity for mode choice. As the developed model manages, this needs to be addressed for a free-flowing tourist transit. Not only does transport model choice impact a site's tourism, but it can also affect the image and reputation of the site. Heritage tourism is mainly affected by the transport model choice due to the lack of various modes since all heritage sites have only some forms of access (by air, land, water, and road). For instance, in the case of Bishnupur, the city lacked access to rail, water, and air in its immediate vicinity but had well-connected road networks. This negatively impacted the heritage tourism of the place, causing minimal to no knowledge of its existence in terms of a heritage city in its neighbourhoods. Multiple relationships have been explored between ‘heritage,’ ‘transportation,’ and ‘tourism,’ but only some have been encountered. Heritage conservation is mainly affected by community knowledge and participation, policy inclusion, economic input, and regional priority; on the other hand, its upliftment is affected by local community contribution, neighbourhood pattern and design, service functions, transportation, and economic input-output. Attempts at advancements in the integration of ‘heritage,’ ‘transportation,’ ‘economy,’ and ‘tourism’ have been made in the developed model and applied to Bishnupur's case to validate the same, showing promising results for better tourism evaluation for small heritage sites with transport and tourism problems having economy generating potential.  8 Conclusion Although the research has been high in tourism, transportation, and economic exploration, incorporating parameters affecting the same to develop an integrated model has yet to be noticed. The model developed through this research enables us to address the gaps in the current works of literature. Bishnupur has all the problems with yearly reducing tourism, congested transportation pathways, degrading economic generation, lack of sustainable financial tools, minimal to negligible community participation, and lack of knowledge about conservation or heritage management. The model incorporates the economic input-output, transit, and specific-to-case land variables to address each site uniquely per their unique conditions. It encourages policymaking to promote community participation to identify heritage management needs. It constructs the universal applicability for all forms of small heritage sites with degrading conditions or lack of acknowledgment. The significant findings, hence, relate to the proposed model, which, when applied to a heritage town of Bishnupur, is destined to guide the future growth of tourism, transportation, and economy for the town to achieve sustainable goals (Goal: 8, 9, 11 & 12). This novel contribution of the research and the model's development will also find its applicability to heritage towns with similar constraints and problems. Such conservation-deprived heritage sites, as in Bishnupur, have the potential of vital resurrection integrating tourism, transportation, economy, and community. It is impossible to justify conservation purely economically, primarily when it depends only on the rationality of the travel and economic choice. Thus, policy measures are required to modify the market forces to which the heritage ecosystem is submitted. This is attainable for Bishnupur following a specific set of policy measures in the light of the following.• Revamping the heritage management system.  • Drawing action plans for each area under stress.  • Proposing integrated conservation of Bishnupur with a focus on tourist travel behaviours, transportation, and economy in and around cultural heritage sites.  • Reduction of traffic pedestrian conflict points through the introduction of necessary interventions.  • Adoption of supplemental traffic design guidelines applicable to high tourist potential sites  • Introducing a streetscape plan for each street in the area eliminates the insensitive additions.  • Guiding, regulating, and controlling the development of heritage-based tourism in Bishnupur to make it functionally efficient, economically viable, and environmentally sustainable.
