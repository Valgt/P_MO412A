                  Sustainable practices in the building industry are strongly influenced by published green and sustainable building and real-estate standards (GSBRES). Therefore, it is crucial to assess how these standards contribute to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper evaluates the extent to which GSBRESs align with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, lending a particular focus to the call for transformative change implicit in the SDGs. To this end, we develop a methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative analysis to assess the overlap between the content of three GSBRESs (LEED for design, BOMA BEST for operation, and GRESB for investment) and the SDGs. Despite the overlaps between the attributes of the GSBRESs and the general topics of the SDGs, we find that less than 20% of GSBRES attributes address the specific targets of the 2030 Agenda. Most importantly, the qualitative analysis shows that less than 10% of the standards' scores is attributed to transformative change. We conclude that claims that the GSBRESs are effective in advancing the SDGs are overstated and, without further empirical evidence, caution that they increase the risk of sustainable development greenwashing. We recommend that the standards be repositioned to adopt transformation-focused indicators related to a project's long-term impacts.

Department of Finance John Molson School of Business Concordia University Montreal Canada       Sustainable practices in the building industry are strongly influenced by published green and sustainable building and real-estate standards (GSBRES). Therefore, it is crucial to assess how these standards contribute to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper evaluates the extent to which GSBRESs align with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, lending a particular focus to the call for transformative change implicit in the SDGs. To this end, we develop a methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative analysis to assess the overlap between the content of three GSBRESs (LEED for design, BOMA BEST for operation, and GRESB for investment) and the SDGs. Despite the overlaps between the attributes of the GSBRESs and the general topics of the SDGs, we find that less than 20% of GSBRES attributes address the specific targets of the 2030 Agenda. Most importantly, the qualitative analysis shows that less than 10% of the standards' scores is attributed to transformative change. We conclude that claims that the GSBRESs are effective in advancing the SDGs are overstated and, without further empirical evidence, caution that they increase the risk of sustainable development greenwashing. We recommend that the standards be repositioned to adopt transformation-focused indicators related to a project's long-term impacts.

Organizations, businesses, and institutions have recently focused on aligning their activities with the 2030 Agenda's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and responding to the call for transformative change, which moves beyond incrementalism (The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, 2018 ). Similarly, the research community has been proactive in studying the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda to understand how different sectors, tools, technologies, and policies contribute to achieving those goals (Fuso Nerini et al., 2018 ; Kroll et al., 2019 ; Maes et al., 2019 ; Nilsson et al., 2016 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ; Tjoa and Tjoa, 2016 ; Yeeles, 2019 ). The achievement of transformative change will depend on developments that move beyond straightforward incremental improvement to those that focus on more radical structural change. This will, in turn, rely on implementing a more progressive political approach that places the focus beyond objects of study or piecemeal approaches and moves towards a comprehensive and holistic developmental vision (Priyadarshini and Abhilash, 2020 ; Utting, 2018 ). With rapid population growth and global urbanization, it is clear that construction activities in cities are likely to continue to expand in the future (United Nations - Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division, 2018 ). These trends provide a unique opportunity for cities in the course of development to review the alignment between construction and the socio-cultural and economic challenges they face (Global Construction Perspectives and Oxford Economics, 2015 ; United Nations - Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division, 2018 ). Against this backdrop, the imperative to tackle challenges arising from climate change requires immediate attention, not only to reduce emissions and resource consumption but also to mobilize strategies that will promote the sustainability of the built environment (Bulkeley, 2013 ; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change et al., 2015 ; Sustainable Development Solutions Network Thematic Group on Sustainable Cities, 2015 ). Even though the transformation of cities and buildings has been highlighted as a key priority for achieving the SDGs (Sachs et al., 2019 ), the building sector itself has been relatively slow and inconsistent in its efforts to adopt the 2030 Agenda compared to other sectors. Instead of exploring the potential for changes that are properly aligned with the 2030 Agenda, sustainable building research and development remains focused on green building standards, and rating tools and systems. Darko and Chan's (2016)  review of trends in green building research shows that close to one-third of such research is dedicated to studying green building (GB) certification. Furthermore, within a year of that review, in 2017, the number of publications related to the GB certification had more than doubled, exceeding some 600 documents (Díaz-López et al., 2019a , 2019b ). Researchers have already highlighted the shortcomings in the formulation of these standards (Díaz-López et al., 2019a , 2019b ), noting the emphasis on environmental dimensions at the cost of social and economic ones (Doan et al., 2017 ) and criticizing the lack of focus on creativity, culture, and the humanities (Liu and Chou, 2019 ). Other researchers have emphasized the inability of the frequently adopted checklist approach to generate the transformative change needed to move beyond the limited objectives of reducing harm and saving energy, resources, and carbon emissions (Amiri et al., 2019 ; Cucuzzella, 2011 ; Newsham et al., 2009 ; Scofield, 2013 ). In the same vein, Ade and Rehm (2019)  conclude that “a common thread evident through the musings of the founding fathers is an element of regret on how green building rating tools have failed to transform the industry” and have resulted in the creation of a “false and virtual green reality” that is disconnected from the real world. These critiques underline a possible misalignment between building standards and the goals of the 2030 Agenda. However, issuers claim that existing green and sustainable building and real-estate standards (GSBRES) contribute significantly to SDG achievement (GRESB, 2019 ; The World Green Building Council, 2017 ). This claim has been supported by several studies, such as the work of Alawneh et al. (2018) , Alawneh et al. (2019a , 2019b) , Roostaie et al. (2019) , and Wen et al. (2020) . These publications mainly reflect regional expertise, which arguably reduces their global relevance. Furthermore, they are restricted to theoretical  frameworks for defining the contribution of building standards, and thus they are not validated by case studies or other empirical evidence. They also follow a selective approach toward the SDGs and, with the exception of Wen et al. (2020) , fail to consider the 2030 Agenda's targets. Moreover, they approach the topic with the a priori assumption that there must be a relationship between the development of building standards and the SDGs; thus, the emphasis is placed on quantifying assumed “contributions” utilizing the qualitative assessment of experts with little or no dependence on empirical evidence. In a recent study, Vitale et al. (2021)  employed a lifecycle-oriented analysis of three GSBRES: LEED, BREEAM, and ITACA. Using a qualitative methodology, they map the overlap between these GSBRES and each of the targets of the 2030 Agenda across 45 cells encompassing (i) the life cycle of buildings (pre-use, use, and end-of-life), (ii) the three pillars of sustainability (society, economy, and environment), and (iii) the stakeholders involved (operator/worker, user/inhabitant, city and world). They find that LEED is the best performing tool, with a mean coverage of 5.48%. However, they also find that, collectively, the tools fail to address some of the critical goals, such as SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (no hunger), SDG4 (education), SDG5 (gender equality), SDG8 (work and growth), SDG10 (inequalities), SDG14 (life below water), SDG16 (peace and justice), and SDG17 (partnership). The authors acknowledge that the main limitation of their study is the subjective nature of the analysis, making it difficult to replicate the findings. Perhaps the most significant drawback is that none of the above-mentioned studies directly addresses the need for transformative change to attain the SDGs, and the capacity of current standards to initiate such systemic transformations.  2 Research aims and framework Thus far, the previous literature has not adequately addressed the following question: can GSBRES contribute to achieving the SDGs? Nevertheless, public agencies continue to institutionalize GSBRES and integrate them into their policy frameworks to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable development (Cole, 2005 ). This would be a valid inference if, and only if, there is a substantial overlap between GSBRES and the SDGs. It is therefore essential to assess whether current GSBRES, and the projects or organizations certified by them, are amply addressing the 2030 Sustainability 2030 Agenda. If they are not, then there is a risk that stakeholders are being given a misleading impression and there is a corresponding need to combat any potential sustainable development greenwashing. This study addresses three main questions related to the correspondence between GSBRES and the SDGs. (i) To what extent do commonly adopted GSBRES overlap with the 2030 Agenda's goals and targets? (ii) How do the particular scoring and category systems employed by the GSBRES affect the pattern of SDGs and targets that are addressed? (iii) How do the objectives of these standards compare to the transformational vision of the 2030 Agenda? To answer the first two questions, we use authoritative sources (The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, 2017a ; United Nations, 2019b ), published research (Körfgen et al., 2018 ; Mori Junior et al., 2019 ; Salvia et al., 2019 ), and reports (Elsevier & SciDev.Net, 2015 ; United Nations, 2019a ) to compile a comprehensive catalog of keywords to represent the topics of the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets. The GSBRES’ text is then evaluated against this catalog using a quantitative technique. The scoring systems employed by the GSBRES are then included in the analysis to examine the changes they cause to the pattern of SDGs and targets that are addressed. To answer the third question, we develop a framework based on sustainable innovation theory (Ceschin and Gaziulusoy, 2016 ; Cucuzzella, 2016 ; Dyllick and Muff, 2016 ; Dyllick and Rost, 2017 ; Fletcher and Goggin, 2001 ; Harremoës et al., 2001 ), to categorize the approaches to sustainability embodied in the GSBRES. We then complete a qualitative evaluation of the implications of building standards for system-level innovation, value creation, and transformation, which are essential features of the 2030 Agenda. Fig. 1   presents the aims and source materials used in these two research paths.  3 Method and calculations We devise a 4-step methodology to answer the proposed research questions. We start by developing the 2030 Agenda keyword catalog (methodology detailed in section 3.1 ). We then analyze the overlap between a GSBRES′ entire text with the keyword catalog at an SDG level (methodology detailed in section 3.2 ). Afterwards, we perform further analyses at a target level while considering the scoring and category structure of the GSBRES (methodology detailed in section 3.3 ). The first three steps make up Path 1, presented in Fig. 1 . Finally, and in line with Path 2 in Fig. 1 , we analyze the sustainability approaches implied by a GSBRES’ text (methodology detailed in section 3.4 ). Fig. 2   summarizes this overall methodology. In this study, we use a series of terms to refer to different features of the GSBRES and their overlaps with the SDGs. The terms and definitions are detailed in Appendix A . We select LEED V4.1 BD + C for New Construction (The U.S. Green Building Council, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, 2020 ) - shortened to LEED - as our analysis' primary green building standard. This is because it is the most frequently used global system of standards and ratings (Doan et al., 2017 ). In addition, we study two other building standards covering building projects' operation and investment phases to provide some generalizability. For the operations phase, we study the Building Owners and Manager's Association's Building Environmental Standards (BOMA BEST) V3 for the “universal” type (The Building Owners and Managers Association, 2018 ) – shortened to BOMA BEST. For the investment phase, we study the GRESB 2020  Real-Estate for performance (GRESB, 2020 ) – shortened to GRESB. 3.1 Building and validating a keyword catalog for the SDGs and their targets We developed a detailed keyword catalog based on the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda, and we used this to map the overlaps between each studied sustainable building standard and the SDGs. This method has been employed in several recent studies to determine the contribution of research to achieving the SDGs (Körfgen et al., 2018 ; Mori Junior et al., 2019 ). Academic publishers and indexing providers have also used this method to assess the contribution of research institutions and researchers to the topics addressed by the 2030 Agenda (Elsevier & SciDev.Net, 2015). However, the available catalogs are mostly limited to SDG-level keywords and do not link to the individual targets of the 2030 Agenda. In addition, the catalogs contain generic terms that are repeated across multiple SDGs, and they fail to include terms of specific relevance to the building and real-estate sectors. We therefore consider it necessary to augment these sources. We began by merging the published catalogs on the topic (Elsevier & SciDev.Net, 2015 ; Körfgen et al., 2018 ; Mori Junior et al., 2019 ; The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, 2017a , 2017b ). The combined list consisted of 915 non-unique keywords, distributed across the 17 SDGs, plus an 18th group entitled Miscellaneous. To improve the catalog's accuracy and ensure comprehensive coverage of all 169 targets, we systematically examined the SDG Data Structure Definition (United Nations, 2019a ) and the official 2030 Agenda document (United Nations, 2015 ) using textual content analysis tools to identify key terms and recurring words. This approach was intended to ensure that we achieved comprehensive coverage of target- and goal-specific keywords. Next, we revised the keywords to ensure non-overlapping terms across the SDGs and targets. We achieved this by adding specificity to keywords that link to a single SDG and by placing keywords that repeatedly appear across multiple SDGs in the Miscellaneous group. We then workshopped, developed, and improved the catalog based on “grey” sources and online tools (such as the LinkedSDG app1  1 http://linkedsdg.apps.officialstatistics.org .  ). Finally, we identified synonyms for basic words and terms, and marked with asterisks (*) that appear in varied forms, such as plurals, alternate tenses, and alternate spellings (but a single meaning). We developed a classification for the level of specificity of different terms as follows:• Miscellaneous keywords  are general terms related to sustainable development but are not specific to one SDG or one target (e.g., ecology ).  • SDG keywords  relate exclusively to the SDG in question but lack the specificity required to indicate overlap with a specific target (e.g., standard of living  for SDG1 or inclusive growth  for SDG8).  • Target-specific keywords  are terms specific to a given SDG and relate exclusively to a target within this goal (e.g., marine pollution  for SDG14.1 or energy efficiency  for SDG7.3). It is important to note that target-specific keywords are included among the SDG keywords when analyzing results at the SDG level.    We employed the open-access R-Studio package to develop a code that documents and tallies the matches between our catalog and a given text file. We used two subsequential paths for validation with six sustainability standards, including three that did not contribute to the main analysis reported in this study (i.e., LEED for Operation and Management, GRESB for Development (GRESB, 2020 ), and STARS (The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, 2019 )). In the first validation path, we compared the outcomes of the R-code analysis to a qualitative assessment conducted on the same texts. The qualitative method, which was taken from Vitale et al. (2021) , involved manually coding the texts based on their overlap with the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda independently from the keyword catalog. After arriving at a collective agreement on the valid overlaps, the final step in this validation path was to adjust the catalog to ensure consistency between the R-Studio code matching output and the qualitative assessment. The second path compared the R-Studio code matching with previous studies describing or quantifying overlaps between GSBRES and the SDGs. Specifically, the standards that are investigated in these publications include LEED (Alawneh et al., 2018 ; Alawneh et al., 2019 ; Alawneh et al., 2019 ; Vitale et al., 2021 ; Wen et al., 2020 ), GRESB (2019) , and STARS (2019). The comparison under the second path was used to further adjust the catalog content. These two validation paths helped improve the reliability and representativeness of the catalog by ensuring that it captured the kinds of overlap found in various studies on the relationship between building standards and the SDGs/targets. In addition, the catalog adjustments allowed us to incorporate industry-specific language (i.e., synonyms and specialized jargon). The final catalog incorporates 1503 keywords, of which 564 have asterisks indicating that they occur with various spellings. Appendix B  shows the distribution of keywords and targets across the SDGs. We observed that the number of keywords for an SDG is correlated with the total number of words describing that goal and its targets in the original UN document.2  2 At a significance level of 0.1%, with a mean of 0.176 keywords per word in the 2030 Agenda, and a standard deviation of 0.180 keywords.   In addition, the total number of keywords for an SDG is correlated with the number of targets attached to that SDG.3  3 At a significance level of 0.1% with a mean of 8.57 keywords per target, and a standard deviation of 2.241 keywords.   This shows that the developed catalog captures the 2030 Agenda's concerns, covering the range of sub-topics of each goal as determined by its specific targets and description size.  3.2 Analyzing the overlap between the standards as a whole and the 2030 agenda In this first quantitative analysis of the three GSBRES selected for study, we begin by extracting the intent of each attribute from the official published industry standards.4  4 The intent of an attribute refers to the section labeled “intent” in the LEED and GRESB documents, and to the section labeled “best practices” in BOMA BEST.   At this stage, we use R-Studio code to calculate the relative frequency of the catalog keywords found within the text describing the intents. For a given keyword from the catalog, we define the relative frequency as the number of words in each GSBRES’ text that match that keyword, divided by the total number of words in that text (we analyze each GSBRES separately). We exclude from the total word count “stop words” (i.e., common words with no individual significance such as “the,” “and,” “or,” “if”) and numerical terms. The details of this analysis are presented in Data File 1. In this phase of the analysis, the distribution of the keywords among the attributes or categories of the standards is not considered. Instead, we focus on the overall match between the standard as a whole and each SDG. We also do not filter out multiple keywords matches within a given category or attribute, nor do we consider the standard's scoring methodology. We use radial diagrams to report the relative frequency of matches for each SDG based on all the keywords for that SDG (described in Table B1  of Appendix B  as “total keywords”). To do this, we combine the relative frequency values for the different keywords pertaining to this SDG. When matches with target-specific keywords occur, we only examine whether these keywords are associated with (i) outcome and/or (ii) means of implementation, using the definitions set out in the 2030 Agenda's original document (United Nations, 2015 ). Thus, the radial graphs illustrate the overall overlap between the standard and the 2030 Agenda and qualify the targets matches for each goal (see, for example, Fig. 3  ).  3.3 Score and target-level analysis At this second analysis stage, we focus on each standard's attributes, categories, and scoring methodology. We again examine the overlap between the intent of each attribute and the keyword catalog, but we also establish a record of the connections between each attribute and specific SDGs and their targets. For example, the intent corresponding to the Advanced Energy Metering attribute in LEED matches with SDG7 (specifically matching Target 7.3 keywords) and SDG12. We overlay this analysis with the standard's scoring methodology (i.e., how the scores are distributed across its attributes) to determine the relative scores given to each SDG and its targets. To do this, we adopt the following procedure: (i) if only one match occurs with an SDG- or Miscellaneous-specific keyword, the score of the attribute is ascribed to the matched SDG or Miscellaneous group, (ii) if only one match occurs with a target-specific keyword, the score of the attribute is ascribed to the matched SDG then to its target, and (iii) when multiple matches occur, the score for the attribute is equally divided across the matching SDGs and Miscellaneous group, and then the relevant portion is ascribed to any matching targets. In this process, when one attribute matches with multiple keywords in the same SDG or target, it is counted as a single match. Because some standards, such as LEED, are designed so that a project can only attain certain credits after meeting specific prerequisites, we transferred the matches from the prerequisite attribute to the relevant scored attribute (see Appendix E1 ). In BOMA BEST, we do not include the attributes that require or refer to third-party standards in the analysis since they do not include any text. In GRESB, we excluded matches to attributes that are not scored and are not prerequisites to other attributes (in total two connections to the miscellaneous category were ignored). For each of the analyzed GSBRES, we present the distribution of its score, in percentage, among the SDGs. Then, using a Sankey diagram, we illustrate the connections between the individual attributes of a given standard and the SDGs and their targets (see, e.g., Figs. 5 and 6 ). The results made it clear to the authors that evaluating the strength of the connections of each intent with the different SDGs and targets requires more qualitative judgment than simply depending on the quantitative matching. Thus, these diagrams show the distribution of the scores across the 2030 Agenda, but do not exactly represent the strength of any given connection.  3.4 Qualitative assessment of the approach GSBRES take to sustainability Following the quantitative analysis, we move to a qualitative assessment of how GSBRES embody the principles and philosophy of sustainability. Design and organizational theory fields offer various frameworks for analyzing different approaches to sustainability. Due to the broad scope of the analyzed standards, we combine three major published frameworks: (i) Fletcher and Goggin's (2001)  three-step structure for eco-design (product, outcome, and need-focused design), (ii) Ceschin and Gaziulusoy's (2016)  four-step evolution of design for sustainability (product, product-service system, spatio-social, and socio-technical system innovation levels), and (iii) Dyllick and Muff (2016 ; 2017)  three-level framework for business and product sustainability (risk management and harm reduction with selective improvements, integrated and systemic management and design, and holistic improvements focused on overcoming critical challenges and creating value). We complement these design and organizational perspectives with risk management theory; specifically, we suggest that, following Harremoës et al. (2001)  and Cucuzzella (2016) , a more nuanced approach to sustainability's wicked problems (Coyne, 2005 ; Rittel and Webber, 1973 ) can be achieved by moving from a preventative to a precautionary approach to risk – i.e., one in which the goal of reducing known and quantifiable risks gives way to the management of risks that are not yet quantifiable and may not be known. Naturally, the latter precautionary approach entails greater uncertainty (Cucuzzella, 2009 ). On the other hand, and by considering the work of Ellul and Wilkinson (1964)  and Dewey (1929) , the principal dependence on technology and the pursuit of certainty are recognized as critical indicators of a preventative, if not reductionist, approach to sustainability. By fusing the above frameworks, we arrive at a four-level typology of different approaches to sustainability embodied in GSBRES (see Appendix C  for the detailed framework): Level 0 “Business as usual” and un-related to sustainable development, Level 1 creating better outcomes through incremental improvements in one dimension of sustainability (environmental, social, or economic), Level 2 creating better outcomes through integrated improvements across several dimensions of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic), and Level 3 creating ‘good’ and positive outcomes and public benefits by tackling critical challenges in a holistic way (taking account of environmental, social, economic and other dimensions). We propose that Level 3 is the most closely aligned with the call for transformative change as per the 2030 Agenda (United Nations, 2015 ) and with recent UN publications that seek to further define and institutionalize the concept of transformation (Baue, 2019 ; Utting, 2018 ). Based on the proposed framework, we conduct a qualitative assessment of the attributes of each standard using an expert-elicitation process (Morgan, 2014 ). We carry out this assessment using the published guides for each standard to understand the focus of the attributes and their approach to risk. This evaluation is then mapped onto the 0 to 3-level classification set out in Table C1  of Appendix C . In this exercise, in addition to the attributes and intents, we consider the explanation, requirements, and data validation procedures set out in the guideline document for each standard. The initial classifications using Levels 0 to 3 were then discussed in a series of group meetings, and we reached a consensus after two further rounds of deliberation. For each of the analyzed GSBRES, we present the distribution of its score, in percentage, among the four different levels. We then design a radial graph (e.g. Fig. 7 ) that represents the distribution of the attributes across Levels 0 to 3. We use the angle size of each sector to represent the number of connections between an attribute and each SDG (excluding Miscellaneous), and use the length of each sector to signal which of the four levels of sustainability the attribute contributes to. In this way, these graphs provide a visual representation of the extent to which each standard approaches the vision implicit in the SDGs, with the highest level indicating alignment with the transformative vision of the 2030 Agenda. The qualitative assessment results are presented in Appendices E1-3  and Data File 1 details the researchers’ comments and the connections used to generate these figures.   4 Results 4.1 LEED and the 2030 agenda From LEED V4.1 BD + C for New Construction, we extract text describing the intents of 54 attributes distributed across nine categories. Overall, the quantitative analysis of the LEED text returns 174 matches with keywords in the catalog. These results are detailed in Appendix D  and illustrated in Fig. 3 , which also presents the overlaps between LEED and the 2030 Agenda. In Fig. 3 , the maximum radial length of the colored bars (from the center outwards) represents a 10% match, which refers to the number of keyword matches for each SDG (or Miscellaneous) as a proportion of the total number of matches in the analyzed text. The 10% threshold in the figure was selected since none of the analyzed GSBRES matched with any single SDGs beyond this value. Full color SDG logos represent those with at least one keyword match while inverted color SDG logos are those with no keyword matches. The two outermost rings, when filled, signify a match with at least one ‘outcome’ target keyword (inner ring) and at least one ‘means of implementation’ target keyword (outer ring). Of the 174, 47 matches pertain to the Miscellaneous group, which is therefore the most dominant (see Fig. 3 ). This suggests that LEED addresses several generic sustainability issues that are not directly within the scope of individual SDGs. Illustrated by the inverted color icons in Fig. 3 , the analyzed LEED standard does not address poverty (SDG1), hunger (SDG2), education (SDG4), gender equality (SDG5), infrastructures (SDG9), inequalities (SDG10), marine ecosystems (SDG14), peace, justice, and institutions (SDG16), or partnership (SDG17). While some of these gaps, such as SDG14, are logical considering LEED's focus on new buildings, other missed connections reveal the standard's selective approach. LEED offers almost comprehensive coverage of the ‘natural environment’ cluster of SDGs (Lucas et al., 2016 ). However, by not addressing SDG1, SDG2, SDG8, and SDG9, LEED exhibits gaps in the ‘production, distribution, and delivery of goods and services’ clusters, as well as critical gaps in the ‘well-being’ cluster. The extracted text from LEED generates matches with eight SDGs. As seen in Fig. 3 , the main overlaps involve matches with keywords from SDG3 (5.5%), followed by SDG12 (4.6%), and SDG11 (4.0%). This illustrates the tendency of LEED to align itself with the 2030 Agenda on health, consumption, and production issues rather than sustainable cities and societies. The LEED's text yields target-specific keyword matches corresponding to seven SDGs (highlighted by a filled inner ring next to the relevant SDG in Fig. 3 ). However, the only overlaps with means of implementation  targets are observed in SDG3 (relating to tobacco control) and SDG7 (relating to demand response), highlighted by a filled outer ring next to the relevant SDG (see Fig. 3 ). Moving to the attribute-level analysis,5  5 We exclude attribute C1 from the “Location and Transportation” category from the SDG and target level analysis since it intended to replace all credits in the category and refers to a third-party standard.   we find that not all attributes of the LEED standard have connections to the SDGs. Overall, LEED's attributes have 65 connections to eight SDGs (representing 69.4% of LEED's score) and 23 connections to the Miscellaneous group (representing 28.8% of LEED's score). This leaves 1.8% of LEED's score un-matched with the catalog. When compared to any single SDG, the Miscellaneous group has the highest relative score. Fig. 4      shows the distribution of the LEED's relative score among the SDGs. Fig. 5  presents LEED's attributes score distribution among the SDGs (the details are reported in Appendix E1 , and the details of the calculations are available in Data File 1). In Fig. 5 , the left-most columns list the categories and the attributes within them. The height of each ‘Relative Score’ box, which is the second column, represents the magnitude of the score of the corresponding attribute, which is then distributed equally across the SDGs with keyword matches. This is represented in Fig. 5  by the Sankey lines. The height of each SDG frame, the right column, is indicative of that SDG's relative score within the standard. The relative score adds up to 100% of possible credits available in the LEED standard (see Fig. 5 ). Only 40 of LEED's 54 attributes are found to match keywords in the catalog: 38 of those match at least one SDG or target-specific keyword and the two other attributes match only with the Miscellaneous category. The distribution of matches is highly variable with some LEED attributes matching keywords related to many SDGs and others matching keywords associated with just one SDG. For example, the “Low Emitting Materials” attribute matches keywords from four SDGs as well as from the Miscellaneous group, while “Indoor Water Use Reduction” matches only one goal (SDG6). Additionally, the scoring system employed by LEED concentrates the credits on a small number of attributes – specifically, it directs most (about 60%) of its credits to 11 of its attributes. For example, the energy and atmosphere category (related to energy optimization, reduction and monitoring), comprise ten attributes and is given 30% of LEED's score. In fact, the single attribute of energy performance optimization accounts for 16.4% of LEED's total score. This concentrates the standard's focus to SDG7 and SDG12. When we move from the SDG level to the target level, we observe a decline in the number of connections (compare the two right-hand columns of Fig. 6 ). These results are presented in Fig. 6 , the details are reported in Appendix E1 , and the details of the calculations are available in Data File 1. Fig. 6  expands the results illustrated in Fig. 5  to include attribute connections to specific targets of SDGs. Here, the relative score attributed to a target match moves through the SDG column to the target column (the rightmost column in the figure). The height of each target frame is indicative of its relative score within the standard. By comparing this size with the size of the SDG and target frames, the difference in the relative score of SDG-level and target-level connections is revealed. In LEED, only 27 of the original 65 connections are linked to specific target keywords (representing 25.4% of LEED's score). This indicates that, while many of the LEED attributes relate to general SDG topics, they have a limited overlap with the specific targets of the 2030 Agenda. For example, an attribute such as “High Priority Site,“6  6 “To build the economic and social vitality of communities, encourage project location in areas with development constraints and promote the ecological and community health of the surrounding area” (The U.S. Green Building Council, 2020 ).   labeled C3 in the “Location and Transportation” category in Figs. 5 and 6 , is related to the topic of community health and well-being (SDG3), as well as to others. However, its focus is not directly aligned with any of the individual targets proposed for SDG3. Thus, in Fig. 6 , the portion of the score pertaining to SDG3 (the green line) for this attribute stops at the SDG column and does not move to the target column. In contrast, the “Access to Quality Transit”7  7 “To encourage development in locations shown to have multimodal transportation choices or otherwise reduced motor vehicle use, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and other environmental and public health harms associated with motor vehicle use” (The U.S. Green Building Council, 2020 ).   attribute, labeled C5 in the “Location and Transportation” category in Figs. 5 and 6 , is aligned explicitly with the air pollution health hazards target, which is Target 3.9 of the 2030 Agenda. Thus, in the case of attribute C5, the portion of the score pertaining to SDG3 (the green line) crosses the SDG frame to establish the connection with Target 3.9. There is a total of 16 matches with different target keywords across seven SDGs, including the two ‘means of implementation’ targets in 3a and 7b. The SDGs that exhibit the greatest number of target-level matches are SDG7 (3 targets, 6.5% of LEED's score), SDG11 (3 targets, 6.6% of LEED's score), and SDG12 (3 targets, 7.8% of LEED's score). It is important to note that all attributes connected to SDG7 (which concerns energy) have target-specific keyword matches, indicating that LEED overlaps with three of the five energy targets. The qualitative analysis findings point to a possible theoretical misalignment between LEED and the 2030 Agenda. The analysis reveals that of the 54 LEED attributes, 44 of those attributes (81%) are focused on Level 0 or Level 1 approaches, representing no, or very little, congruence with the transformative approach to sustainability implicit in the 2030 Agenda. We find that the three attributes assessed as Level 3 for LEED have connections with two SDGs: SDG3 and SDG11. From the 66 connections to the eight SDGs produced by the 38 LEED attributes, the majority pertain to Level 0 or 1 attributes (48 connections), with fewer at Levels 2 and 3 (13 and 5, respectively). The outcome of the qualitative analysis is shown in Fig. 7  (see Appendix E1  for details; calculation details are available in Data File 1). In Fig. 7 , the total number of connections between all the analyzed attributes and a given SDG is represented by the length of the outer arc of that SDG. Attributes that do not have any connections with the SDGs are not represented in this figure. The number of connections derived from Level 3 attributes is indicated in the outermost ring of the relevant sector. For example, SDG3 has the most significant number of connections. The radial length of each colored sector within each SDG represents the qualitative assessment of the level of the attributes that generated the connections (i.e., attribute levels 0, 1, 2, and 3 correspond to different rings of the chart, as shown in the legend). By way of example, all the connections with SDG8 were derived from Level 1 attributes, while three of the connections with SDG3 came from Level 3 attributes (see Appendix C  for definitions of the levels). The figure, therefore, shows the number of connections between the LEED text and the SDGs, broken down by the level of the attributes generating those connections. LEED's scoring methodology enforces this conclusion, with more than 69% of its score allocated to Level 0 and Level 1, with 25.4% and only 5.6% to Level 2 and Level 3, respectively. Fig. 8   shows this relative score distribution, where the total bar length indicates the total score allocated to all attributes assessed at a given level, including those with no connection to the SDGs. To summarize, the LEED standard we analyze includes a substantial amount of jargon that is broadly related to sustainability but not explicitly related to one of the 17 SDGs. LEED has connections to only eight of the 17 SDGs and fails, in general, to address the targets of the 2030 Agenda - its text matches only 15 of the 169 targets. In addition, we find that, even in the areas of the 2030 Agenda that LEED does address, the standard is primarily focused on incremental improvement rather than transformative change. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that LEED is an environmental management tool whose goal is to reduce and manage the known harms and risks related to new buildings by proposing piecemeal improvements. These improvements are related to production and consumption issues associated with energy and materials. The improvements also attempt to avoid risks to human health and well-being arising from the potentially adverse features of buildings. While LEED does assist in reducing the environmental or human-related disbenefits associated with building construction and use, it has rather limited potential to address the complex issues implicit in the SDGs (as claimed by Alawneh et al., 2018  and others). For example, even though the application of the LEED criteria related to energy might help reduce consumption, increase efficiency, or share renewables, the standard hardly promotes attributes that can advance the goal of “ensur[ing] access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” - as viewed from the 2030 Agenda's equity and energy justice perspective (United Nations, 2015 ).  4.2 BOMA BEST and GRESB, and their correspondence to LEED In this section, we focus on the operation and investment phases of buildings and real-estate projects. As noted in Section 3 , we select BOMA BEST and GRESB, respectively, as the standards to address these two phases. We follow a similar analysis process to that employed for LEED. From BOMA BEST, we extract textual information for 19 attributes distributed across 16 BEST practices (organized in the form of questions). From GRESB, we extract 79 attributes distributed across 16 aspects in three categories. Details of the scoring mechanism are provided in Appendices E2 and E3 , and Data File 1. The R-Studio tool shows a 21.9% overlap between the BOMA BEST text and the keywords in the catalog (including Miscellaneous), while that for the GRESB shows a 13.2% match. Fig. 9   presents the matches between the BOMA BEST and GRESB texts and the SDGs (detailed in Appendix C ). Thus, of the three GSBRES analyzed, GRESB shows the smallest number of direct matches with the SDG keywords, while the LEED text (with 29% of the text matching keywords in the catalog) shows the greatest. None of the analyzed texts from the three GSBRES matches keywords in SDG1, SDG2, SDG5, or SDG14 (illustrated by the inverted color icons in Fig. 9 ). Moreover, GRESB is the only standard to produce matches with keywords from SDG16, SDG4, SDG10, and SDG17 (ordered in decreasing percentages of the matched content). We note that the text of all three standards matches with SDG12, with percentages of 4.6%, 9.4%, and 1.5% for LEED, BOMA BEST and GRESB, respectively. These are illustrated by full color icons in Fig. 9 , which follows the same rubric as Fig. 3 . The findings suggest that the three GSBRES are not primarily dedicated to issues related to sustainable cities and communities as framed in SDG11. Instead, these standards overlap mainly with issues related to sustainable consumption and production (SDG12), health and well-being (SDG3), water (SDG6), and energy (SDG7). It is clear that LEED and BOMA BEST primarily concern themselves with the clusters of SDGs pertaining to the ‘natural environment’ and the ‘production, distribution, and delivery of goods and services’ (Lucas et al., 2016 ). They also generate some matches with the ‘well-being’ cluster, although these matches are confined to health (SDG3). GRESB offers a different approach, with a greater focus on the ‘well-being’ and ‘production, distribution, and delivery of goods and services’ clusters and less focus on ‘natural environment’ clusters. These results highlight the variation in the coverage of SDG topics across the three GSBRES, potentially generating tensions between stakeholder groups from different interpretations of priorities when moving from design to operation and from operation to investment.8  8 It is important to note that GRESB's intent text tends to be significantly longer and more descriptive than the other two standards (average 26 words per attribute for GRESB, 11 in LEED and 5 in BOMA Best). Thus, the matching percentage is lower since the number of individual matched keywords is divided by the total number of words. Our analysis of the three standards reveals a weak correlation between the word count and the number of SDG matches and a weak correlation between the word count and the number of matches per SDG.   Moving to the attribute-level of analysis, the results show that 10 of BOMA BEST's 16 attributes (62.5%) and 41 of GRESB's 79 attributes (51.8%) match keywords related to the SDGs. BOMA BEST adopts a focused approach, with the 16 analyzed attributes having ten connections to four SDGs (representing 66.3% of BOMA BEST's score). On the other hand, the 79 analyzed attributes of GRESB have 65 connections to 12 SDGs (representing 56.7% of the GRESB's score). Fig. 10   shows the distribution of the BOMA BEST's and GRESB's relative scores among the SDGs, following the same rubric as Fig. 5 . It can be said that the overlaps of LEED and GRSEB with the 2030 Agenda are more complex than that of BOMA BEST, since each of LEED and GRESB attributes matches with a larger number of SDGs than each of the BOMA BEST attributes. As with LEED, the scoring methodologies of both BOMA BEST and GRESB focus their credits on a small number of attributes; five of the 16 attributes of BOMA BEST account for close to 50% of the score, and 15 of 79 attributes of GRESB account for more than 60% of the score. In BOMA BEST, the single attribute related to indoor air quality is heavily weighted, receiving 12% of the total possible score. GRESB's scoring methodology also emphasizes energy-related issues, with the single attribute “GRESB EN1-energy consumption for this property type” accounting for 14% of the total possible score. The SDG that yields keyword matches with the largest number of attributes (five) for BOMA BEST is SDG12. In the case of GRESB, the most significant number of matches (16 attributes) is obtained for keywords from SDG16. GRESB's focus on SDG16 highlights its emphasis on transparency and the institutionalization of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards in the management and operation of buildings in an investment portfolio. Thus, the three standards each have a different focus based on their attribute matches: LEED on SDG3 (health and well-being), BOMA BEST on SDG12 (sustainable consumption and production) and GRESB on SDG16 (Peace, justice, and strong institutions). As is the case with LEED, the move from goal to target-level analysis is accompanied by an apparent decline in connections. Only six of the original 10 connections in BOMA BEST (representing 22.5% of the score) and 16 of the original 65 connections in GRESB (representing 17.5% of the score) relate to specific targets. BOMA BEST connects with three targets from two of the original four SDGs (namely Targets 6.5, 12.4, and 12.5). GRESB connects with eight targets from seven of the original 12 SDGs, including a target in SDG16. Across the three GSBRES, we observe high target-specific matches for SDG12, further highlighting a shared focus on sustainable production and consumption patterns. The combined outcomes for SDG and target-level analysis for BOMA BEST and GRESB are presented in Fig. 11   (detailed in Appendices E2 and E3 ). Fig. 11  follows the same rubric as Fig. 6 . We observe a gap in the transformative focus of the two standards. Some 14 of the 16 BOMA BEST attributes (87.5%), and 54 of the 79 GRESB attributes (68.5%), are assessed at Level 0 and Level 1. The single attribute ranked at Level 3 for BOMA BEST forms no connections with the SDGs, as is the case for the attribute at Level 2. GRESB has 12 Level 2 attributes and 13 Level 3 attributes. The latter form only seven connections with the SDG4, SDG12, SDG8, SDG13, and SDG11. Interestingly, none of the GRESB attributes ranked at Level 0 (“business as usual”) forms any connections with the SDGs. Fig. 12   presents these findings with further details in Appendices E2 and E3 . Fig. 12  follows the same rubric as Fig. 7 . We calculate the relative scores allocated to transformative (Level 3) attributes to be 6% for LEED, 5% for BOMA BEST, and 11% for GRESB. This indicates that most of the scores for the GSBRES that we have analyzed are allocated to “business as usual” or “incremental” approaches rather than transformative change. Fig. 13   shows the relative score distribution for BOMA BEST and GRESB. Our findings call into question whether, on the basis of their current approach to sustainability, these GSBRES can contribute effectively to the achievement of the SDGs – understood as a set of transformative goals. Additionally, the findings point to a possible incongruence between the dominant approach of design (LEED) and operation (BOMA BEST) standards and that of investment and real-estate portfolio performance management (GRESB); the latter is more holistic in its approach to sustainability, a phenomenon that requires further investigation.   5 Discussion 5.1 Considerations of synergies and tradeoffs within the 2030 agenda An important factor to consider in the context of the SDGs is their interdependencies. The fact that the standards investigated in this study focus mainly on sustainable consumption and production (SDG12) and economic growth (SDG8) is potentially problematic, as these have substantial tradeoffs with other goals, including SDGs related to social and economic progress (Kroll et al., 2019 ; Pradhan et al., 2017 ). As a further example, the focus in the LEED and BOMA BEST scoring methodologies on indoor air environment, which affects health and well-being (SDG3), may adversely affect energy-related targets (SDG7). This tradeoff is clearly illustrated by the outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic requiring more fresh air in built spaces, leading to higher energy use (Zheng et al., 2021 ). According to Fader et al. (2018) , the focus on SDG6 (water) and SDG7 (energy) could result in a degree of synergy between two goals. However, Fuso Nerini et al. (2018)  propose that the disproportionate attention to SDG7 could result in tradeoffs with a significant proportion of the targets of SDG14 (life under water) and SDG15 (life on land) due to the GHG emissions, spatial requirements of energy systems, and the significant resources needed to develop energy production systems. This risk is amplified when one considers that the three analyzed standards barely address SDG14 and SDG15. Also, Fader et al. (2018)  suggest that the focus on Target 7. b could create constraints in achieving food-related targets (such as 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3). This tradeoff is clear in LEED, where it focuses on Target 7. b and completely ignores SDG2 (food). Moreover, Scharlemann et al. (2020)  suggest that without clear links to SDG2 (food) and SDG13 (climate action), the focus on water issues (SDG6) presents a missed opportunity for potential synergy – to improve access to food and reduce water pollution and acidification. Whilst the emphasis on air quality and emission reduction connects most standards to parts of both SDG3 and SDG11 (Nilsson et al., 2018 ), these connections remain generic, rather than concrete or operational; failing to address specific targets in those goals. Finally, Pradhan et al. (2017) . Suggest that a focus on SDG11 could create positive synergies with poverty-related issues (SDG1) and climate action (SDG13), but only if it is complemented by an emphasis on risk exposure reduction (topics addressed by Targets 11.5 and 11. b). However, the three standards we analyzed have not realized these synergies due to the absence of disaster and risk exposure management considerations. Further analysis of possible relationships between standards and the 2030 Agenda, including standards in other sectors, is needed to provide greater clarity and better transparency. Specifically, future studies could usefully examine the synergies and tradeoffs identified by Fuso Nerini et al. (2018)  and Kroll et al. (2019) , as well as the direct and indirect relationships between the GSBRES and the 2030 Agenda suggested by Goubran (2019) . It is essential to demonstrate these relationships to professional communities, property owners, and governments because current research tends to exaggerate the role and contribution of normative building and real estate standards to the achievement of SDGs (see Alawneh et al. (2018) , Alawneh et al. (2019) , Alawneh et al. (2019) , Roostaie et al. (2019) , and Wen et al. (2020) ).  5.2 Placing the findings in the context of the research literature This study builds on the findings of Vitale et al. (2021) . However, we use the keyword catalog as an objective method for identifying overlaps between GSBRES and the topics covered in the 2030 Agenda, thereby improving upon the more generous and subjective comparisons reported by Vitale et al. (2021) . Additionally, our analysis can be integrated into the lifecycle approach proposed by Vitale et al. (2021) ; i.e., our approach can be used to examine the potential of GSBRES to promote transformative change throughout the life cycle of a project across different domains of sustainability, and from the perspective of the different stakeholders involved. Excluding the recent contribution of Vitale et al. (2021) , previous studies employ elaborate qualitative, accounting, and statistical methods to examine how GSBRES contribute to the achievement of the SDGs (e.g., Alawneh et al. (2018) , Alawneh et al. (2019) , Alawneh et al. (2019) , Roostaie et al. (2019) , Omer and Noguchi (2020) , and Wen et al. (2020) . Yet, the basis of the analysis remains mostly the subjective assessment of industry experts. These studies reached the conclusion that current standards and practices are helping to (i) achieve equal access to services by gender and socio-economic class (as reported by Omer and Noguchi, 2020 ), (ii) reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases, and make improvements in regional and transborder infrastructure (as shown by Wen et al. (2020)  who demonstrated that LEED contributes to Targets 3.4 and 9.1), and (iii) achieve all the energy targets incorporated in SDG7 (Alawneh et al., 2018 ). The findings presented here do not support these contentions and suggest that further evidence and case studies are required to demonstrate that current GSBRES can address these systemic challenges. Furthermore, we argue that even if indirect connections to the above targets can be shown to exist, influential contributions cannot be realized through incremental improvements. They require a more holistic approach that extends beyond individual projects and tracks outcomes and progress over much longer timespans than is currently envisaged in the commonly adopted GSBRES. Additionally, the studies cited above focus on calculating indices of hypothetical contributions, rather than demonstrating the evidence for, and basis of, the overlap between GSBRES and the specific targets of the 2030 Agenda. In so doing, these studies tend to obscure the mechanisms by which projects driven by GSBRES may contribute to the 2030 Agenda. Further, although these publications are technical in nature, they assess the overlap between GSBRES and SDGs largely on the basis of the subjective assessment of industry experts, rendering the findings challenging to replicate. The quantitative methodology presented here provides an objective and repeatable means of measuring overlap and generates findings that are in line with previous studies of LEED; for example, our results match the overlaps with the SDGs reported by Alawneh et al. (2018 , 2019)  and the overlaps with some of the relevant targets (and SDGs) noted by Wen et al. (2020) .9  9 Namely SDGs 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 15, and Targets 3.9, 6.3, 6.5, 7.2, 7.3, 11.2.11.6, 11.7, 12.2.12.4, 12.5, and 15.3.   However, since our focus is more granular (i.e., examining the individual attributes and scoring methodologies of the GSBRES as well as the connections with individual targets), our findings can support more detailed conclusions than would otherwise be possible. Thus, we found that fewer than 70% of the attributes embedded in the standards fit within the scope of the 2030 Agenda, and less than 25% of their scores are attributable to the targets of the 2030 Agenda. In addition, our study contributes to the field by providing a qualitative assessment of the approach to sustainability that characterizes each of the three GSBRES. The qualitative analysis clearly highlights the discontinuity between the incrementalist approach to sustainability implicit in these standards and the value-driven approaches required to realize the broader transformative vision of the 2030 Agenda. The most progressive standard, GRESB, only allocates 10.5% of its score to transformative objectives, with LEED and BOMA BEST falling behind at 6% and 5%, respectively. This suggests that previous research has provided an incomplete picture of the fit between GSBRES and the 2030 Agenda by (i) overlooking the social, cultural, and economic aspirations embedded in the 2030 Agenda, and (ii) equating incremental improvement with transformative change. In fact, the standards’ founding fathers noted this failure to promote transformative change (Ade and Rehm, 2019 ). To progress beyond this impasse, GSBRES must move towards post-anthropocentric and more-than-human viewpoints (Loh et al., 2020 ). They should focus less on energy optimization, harm reduction, improved efficiency, and other quantitative criteria and aspire towards net-positive, circular, and equity objectives.  5.3 Limitations This study relied on both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to evaluate the contribution of GSBRES to sustainable development. While the statistical analysis of the GSBRES and SDG texts produced outcomes in line with previous findings, this does not, in itself, guarantee valid conclusions. In particular, the analysis of content can only be used to indicate where  overlaps and matches might appear, but not the strength or significance of those links. Keyword matches can only indicate some commonality in the content of the attributes and the SDGs. However, the potential of an attribute to genuinely contribute to the SDG has to be assessed qualitatively based on a semantic analysis of the approach – one that takes account of the values and conceptualization of sustainability embedded within the attribute. Thus, the qualitative analysis was critical to reaching a robust assessment of the degree of alignment of a given standard with the SDGs. By extending the development of the keyword catalog, future research could improve the sensitivity and accuracy of the quantitative phase of the assessment. Additionally, textual analysis tools could be deployed to enrich the qualitative analysis and improve its reliability. This study's main aim was to examine the variations in the focus and approach of three standards in terms of their promotion of the 2030 Agenda. We thus study the three tools independently, rather than examining their union and intersections along the lines of other studies such as Vitale et al. (2021) . This independent analysis poses some limitations for researchers or practitioners that are interested in deploying multiple standards in the life cycle of the same project. We suggest that those interested in comparative or combined-standard analysis to add weighting factors, based on total word count, to normalize the evaluations. Finally, the reader should note that not all projects or organizations certified by these standards attempt to achieve all the credits available. Instead, a selective approach is usually adopted (Boschmann and Gabriel, 2013 ). Thus, the outcomes presented here represent a theoretical upper limit to promoting SDGs – a limit that some projects might not reach.   6 Conclusion To investigate whether GSBRES meaningfully contribute to achieving the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of three commonly used standards, following a straightforward and replicable methodology. While researchers have already highlighted some of the flaws of the existing GSBRES, our critique contributes to the field in four ways: (i) it calls into question the extent of the contribution of GSBRES to the achievement of the SDGs, reinforcing the findings of Vitale et al. (2021) , (ii) it extends the analysis of GSBRES beyond the design phase, looking at the features of the operation and investment-focused rating and certification schemes, (iii) it provides an objective method of assessing the overlap between sustainability building standards and the 2030 Agenda, and (iv) it incorporates a method of assessing the potential of GSBRES to promote transformative change. We find that GRESB provides broad coverage of the SDG topics, including institutional issues, and that it addresses sustainability principles such as education, equality, innovation, peace, and partnership. These areas are of critical importance to sustainable building, as reflected in the sustainability reports of real-estate companies (Ionașcu et al., 2020 ). However, GRESB is limited in terms of its overlap with the specific targets of the 2030 Agenda. LEED successfully addresses topics specific to many of the 2030 Agenda's goals, but it has the highest ratio of attributes (more than 70%) that are incremental in their approach, and it is biased towards the ‘environment’ pillar of sustainability. It also has the smallest proportion of attributes with a potential for value creation. Finally, BOMA BEST focuses narrowly on operational issues that are not generally in line with the 2030 Agenda, but when overlaps occur, the standard shows the potential to address target-specific issues. Overall, these design and operational standards are primarily focused, in content and through their scoring, on issues related to sustainable production and consumption, health, water, energy, and urbanization. Furthermore, the focus of the three standards on SDG12, SDG3, SDG6, SDG7, and SDG11, and their corresponding targets, ignore potentially significant synergies with human-focused goals and may result in tradeoffs. In the context of the potential of the standards for promoting transformative change, we propose that LEED can contribute to creating some of the required changes for achieving SDG3 and SDG11, mainly Target 11.7. On the other hand, BOMA BEST does not contribute to the promotion of transformative change for any of the SDGs. GRESB is the most comprehensive, with possible contributions to SDG4 (4.3), SDG8, SDG11, SDG12 (12.6), and SDG16 (16.7). To serve policymakers and practitioners better, we recommend that building and real-estate researchers use evidence-based approaches, case studies, and controlled trials to validate theoretical contributions from GSBRES attributes that do not directly call for environmental, social, cultural, or economic value creation. Without further empirical evidence, claims that GSBRES are effective in advancing the SDGs present a risk of sustainable development greenwashing Table 1   presents a comparison between the three GSBRES analyzed, illustrating their triple bottom line and transformative potential. Based on the findings presented in this study, better coordination between the standards is needed, to ensure that they continue to address and monitor the progress and application of the indicators across the lifecycle of a building or project. It is highly recommended that GRESB focus on SDG4 and SDG16 be used as a model for the design- and operation-focused GSBRES to ensure that they contribute to sustainable development that spans beyond the building or project boundaries. The findings also point to the gap in operation-focused GSBRES. Specifically, we recommend broadening the focus and coverage of these operation standards – to move beyond harm reduction and resource efficiency targets to include other human and planetary goals. This expanded focus would enable buildings to contribute to the SDGs throughout their operation, meeting the requirements of investors and forcing designers to consider the operation and maintenance in the early design phases of building projects. Ultimately, we consider that more transformational, contextual, and comprehensive standards that are fundamentally designed around the SDGs are needed (Brandon et al., 2017 ). As suggested by Baue (2019) , sustainability standards should move away from indicators that are focused on absolute values (e.g., total waste), intensity (e.g., energy per meter squared), and progress percentage (e.g., percent reduction in material consumption). Instead, they should establish a minimum level for all indicators that is related to the context in which they will be used. This can be done by linking absolute performance thresholds to either (i) globally set scientific limits (e.g., by studying how the reduction in carbon footprint relates to IPCC scenarios) or (ii) to local needs and conditions (e.g., by studying how a reduction in energy in a building contributes to the availability and security of energy supplies in a neighborhood). More importantly, these new standards should allocate the largest portion of their assessment to transformational indicators focused on reorganizing social reproduction (Utting, 2018 ). This can be done by considering both the environmental consequences of a building and its systems and their potential long-term social, cultural, and economic impact. It also requires building professionals to assess a project's explicit and implicit goals and targets, and the pace, scale, and scope of actions needed to achieve those goals.

APPENDIX A –Terms and Definitions In the study, we use a variety of terms to describe the different features of the GSBRES and their overlaps with the SDGs:• Category  refers to one of the thematic divisions of a GSBRES against which projects are evaluated. Example: “Sustainable Sites” is one of LEED's nine categories.  • Aspect  refers to a sub-division within a category if it exists in a given GSBRES10  10 From the three GSBRES analyzed, only GRESB divides its categories into aspects.   Example: “Leadership” is one of the five aspects that GRSEB analyzes in the management category.  • Attribute  refers to an individual element of evaluation in a given GSBRES that falls within a category, and aspect (if it exists). Example: “Open Space” is one attribute that LEED assesses in the Sustainable Sites category.  • Credit  or Score:  Depending on the language used to formulate each GSBRES, we use these two words interchangeably to refer to the rating applied to those attributes that are given a score or credit. Some attributes are considered prerequisites and are evaluated without being scored (e.g. Construction Activity Pollution Prevention attribute in LEED's Sustainable Sites category) or are given zero score since they formulate the basis of the evaluation of subsequent attributes (e.g. “The entity's standing investments portfolio during the reporting year” attribute which is needed to assess the risk in the GRESB's Performance category). Each GSBRES′ manual detail its scoring methodology, usually, partial or full score is attained in a specific attribute based on the fulfillment of predefined criteria.11  11 Important to note that the analysis presented here considers the full score of each attribute, making the specific scoring criteria beyond the scope of this paper.   For the three GSBRES analyzed, the score attribution appears in Appendix E  (1–3).  • Scoring methodology  refers to how a given standard distributes the available credits or scores across the categories and attributes that fall within that standard.  • Relative score  refers to the score a single attribute is assigned relative to the total possible score of the whole standard. Similarly, it refers to the score attributed to a single SDG or target.  • Intent  refers to the portion of the text of a given GSBRES that expresses the purpose of, and rationale for, an attribute. The intent also captures the importance of the attribute within the context of the standard, and the view of sustainability that is implied by implementing this attribute (The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, 2019 ). Intents are usually labeled in GSBRES documents as ‘intent’, ‘description’ or ‘purpose’, and provide information about the sustainability concepts implied by the standard.  • Text  refers to a section of the documentation associated with GSBRES that is extracted and used to capture the intent of an attribute (defined above).  • Match  refers to the correspondence between a word in the analyzed text and the keyword catalog. The number of matches is used as an indicator of the overlap or congruity between an attribute of the GSBRES and the SDGs and their targets.  • Connection  refers to the network of matches between a GSBRES attribute and the different SDGs and their targets.
