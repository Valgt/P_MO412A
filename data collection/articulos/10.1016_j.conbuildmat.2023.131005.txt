                  Concrete is the second most consumed material on our planet. However, traditional concrete production releases much CO2 and is not eco-friendly. Cement, one of the prime concrete-making materials, is manufactured using an energy-intense process and is not eco-friendly. Researchers have been investigating using certain materials to replace cement in concrete, retaining its strength simultaneously. Red Mud (RM) is a waste the alumina industry generates, and its disposal is a huge challenge. It consumes a lot of space, and its high alkali content makes it unsafe for the environment. Several types of research are being carried out to find how RM can effectively alleviate the use of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in concrete, thus providing a greener construction material. This review highlights the effect of using RM in varying proportions on the fresh, mechanical, thermal, durability, and microstructural properties of cementitious materials. Using RM up to certain levels positively impacts the compressive strength of the mixes. The durability properties, such as the resistance to chloride migration, freezing-thawing action, and alkali-silica reactions, also improve using RM. The microstructural studies reveal the formation of a higher amount of hydration products and densification of the matrix upon RM addition. In terms of the leaching characteristics, RM has a good potential to stabilize and solidify heavy metals, majorly cadmium. The review has calculated and summarized the overall environmental, mechanical, and economic performance. This review shows that RM can effectively replace around 10–20% of cement, where the replacement levels also depend on the RM source.

Concrete is the second most consumed material on our planet. However, traditional concrete production releases much CO2  and is not eco-friendly. Cement, one of the prime concrete-making materials, is manufactured using an energy-intense process and is not eco-friendly. Researchers have been investigating using certain materials to replace cement in concrete, retaining its strength simultaneously. Red Mud (RM) is a waste the alumina industry generates, and its disposal is a huge challenge. It consumes a lot of space, and its high alkali content makes it unsafe for the environment. Several types of research are being carried out to find how RM can effectively alleviate the use of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in concrete, thus providing a greener construction material. This review highlights the effect of using RM in varying proportions on the fresh, mechanical, thermal, durability, and microstructural properties of cementitious materials. Using RM up to certain levels positively impacts the compressive strength of the mixes. The durability properties, such as the resistance to chloride migration, freezing-thawing action, and alkali-silica reactions, also improve using RM. The microstructural studies reveal the formation of a higher amount of hydration products and densification of the matrix upon RM addition. In terms of the leaching characteristics, RM has a good potential to stabilize and solidify heavy metals, majorly cadmium. The review has calculated and summarized the overall environmental, mechanical, and economic performance. This review shows that RM can effectively replace around 10–20% of cement, where the replacement levels also depend on the RM source.   Keywords Industrial waste  Bauxite residue  Alumina  Cement paste  Mortar  ordinary Portland cement  Concrete   Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article.   1 Introduction Red Mud (RM) is an alkaline solid waste byproduct formed when alumina is extracted from bauxite ore, mainly by Bayer’s process. Around 35–40% of the ore is disposed off as alkaline RM slurry [1,2] . RM disposal is environmentally detrimental to the surrounding ground, water, and air [3] . Its high pH of around 13 destroys vegetation and organic matter in the area. According to the report given by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India, the worldwide annual production of RM is 140 million tonnes, with around 75–80 % of the total being produced in Australia and China [4] . RM generation in India is around 9 million tonnes annually [5] . Table 1   shows the production amount of RM by major Indian industries. Various methods are used worldwide to dispose of RM, with a few major techniques being–dry disposal, marine disposal, wet disposal, and RM lagooning methods [6] . The conventionally used disposal method consists of discharging RM into specifically constructed tanks. However, this method is not environmentally safe as the alkaline waste can be carried away by heavy monsoons and potentially reach the groundwater flows, contaminating the water supply [7] . Another method, namely the wet storage method, involves discharging RM into specially excavated pools, and the water in RM is discharged through a water guide system or evaporated. But this method requires a huge yard with a high level of water resistance, which will be space-consuming [8] . Even for the dry disposal method, the exposed RM will cause dust pollution and endanger the health of humans and animals [9] . Various storage and disposal techniques of RM have been summarized by Power et al. [10] . Despite all attempts, with the increasing quantity of RM production throughout the globe, the disposal methods fall short due to the unavailability of land and the hazardous nature of RM, deteriorating the environment of that place. Many accidents have occurred due to failure in the disposal system. RM pond failure occurred in Muri, India, in April 2019 due to a system breach leading to slurry spreading over the nearby agricultural land and the railway track. The satellite images of the area before and after the incident are shown in Fig. 1  . Also, in the Sambalpur district of Odisha, acres of farmland got submerged with iron ore slurry after the breach of the tailing pond wall on 22nd January 2022. Owing to the increase in such incidents and growing concern, proper utilization of RM in various ways has been researched. RM has found various applications in the construction industry, production of glass ceramics, bricks manufacturing, geopolymers, water treatment, as a catalyst, and recovery of metals which have been summarized in the works [3,11–14] . Liu et al. [15]  discussed the various methods by which RM can extract iron, which is of great significance. Liu and Li [16]  presented a detailed study on extracting valuable elements from RM. The approximate percentage-wise application of RM in various sectors is summarized in Fig. 2  . On the other hand, the construction sector produces a lot of concrete using cement from non-renewable sources, which is the most consumed building material worldwide. The clinker production phase during the manufacturing of OPC by the calcination process contributes to carbon dioxide emission in the atmosphere [17] . Studies have shown that the cement industry accounts for 5–7% of the total CO2  emissions and is the second-highest emitter of industrial carbon dioxide [18] . Cement consumption has a growing trend and could increase by almost 65% of the present amount by the year 2050, which will push the global CO2  emissions levels by the cement industry to around 30% [19] . Looking at these, the construction industry has been trying to adopt sustainable and eco-friendly raw materials to reduce the carbon footprint without degrading the properties of concrete. RM being a waste product, has no extra production charges and does not increase the emissions but reduces the emissions from cement production. Using RM as cement replacement can help not just to reduce storage problems but as well as improve concrete properties if used in appropriate quantity. Research has been carried out to understand the modifications in fresh, mechanical, and microstructural properties of concrete when RM partially replaces the OPC-based binder. Lima et al. [20]  listed how RM can be used with ceramic materials, for cement production, and as a filler in a bituminous mixture for road construction. Sawant et al. [21]  reviewed the chemical and mineralogical composition of RM and how it can be used in cement clinker production. Saravanan et al. [22]  in the study, reviewed the physical and mechanical properties of concrete where RM partially replaced cement. Venkatesh et al. [23]  reviewed the strength, durability, and certain microstructural properties when RM in concrete replaced cement. Putrevu et al. [24]  reviewed the effect of using RM to replace cement in concrete and bricks based on the fresh, mechanical, and durability properties. The characteristic properties of using RM to synthesize geopolymers were reviewed by Kumar et al. [25] . A review of the impact of using RM to replace cement on the hardened properties has been done by Singh et al. [26] . Besides replacing cement, RM has also been used as a pavement material in road bases and asphalt mixes, positively affecting the strength parameters [27,28] . In this review, a detailed analysis of the fresh, mechanical, durability, thermal, and microstructural properties of using RM to replace cement in cement pastes and concrete has been carried out. The environmental performance of some of the mixes has also been evaluated, considering the strength, cost, and environmental factors.  2 Characterization of Red Mud There are two types of RM based on their production method, i.e., Bayer’s RM and sintered RM. Most of the RM used in the documented studies were generated by Bayer’s process of producing alumina. In this process, the bauxite ore is digested in concentrated caustic soda solution at an elevated temperature of around 270 °C and high pressure [29] . The composition of RM produced during this process varies from place to place due to the change in the properties of the source ore. RM is composed of hematite (α-Fe2 O3 ), goethite (α-FeOOH), sodalite (Na4 Al3. 3SiO12 Cl), bohemite (ɣ-AlO(OH)), quartz (SiO2 ), and gypsum (CaSO4 ·2H2 O) majorly. Minor traces of calcite, gibbsite, and TiO2  are also found [29] . The major oxides composition of the papers reviewed are Fe2 O3 , Al2 O3 , CaO, SiO2 , TiO2 , Na2 O, MgO, SO3 , K2 O, and loss on ignition. The percentage composition of these oxides as a range is shown in Fig. 3  . Other oxides like P2 O5 , ZrO2 , MnO2 , V2 O5 , ZnO, CuO, SnO2 , CdO, As2 O3  are present as trace elements in less than 0.2% by weight. Fig. 4   shows an approximate mineralogical composition of RM. A ternary phase diagram showing various material zones based on the major oxides is shown in Fig. 5  . The FTIR spectra of raw RM were observed by Luo et al. [30] . Reddy et al. (2021) [31]  and Liu et al. (2014) [32]  presented a review of the physical, chemical, mineralogical composition, and environmental nature of RM obtained from various sources. It is seen that RM calcined between 200 and 800 °C are alike in molecular structure. However, most peak bands disappear at higher temperatures (900 or 1000 °C). On an overall basis, an increase in calcination temperature alters the chemical structure of RM related to the Al-O and Si-O bonds, increasing their degree of polymerization and, when used in cement-based materials, leading to the formation of more hydrated products, i.e., calcium aluminium silicate hydrate (CASH) in particular. However, based on the production method, RM can be classified into two types prominently, whose differences are described in Table 2  [8] .  3 Methodology Various review studies accessible in the literature addressed the utilization of RM in different fields. This study comprises a compilation of research work dealing with the replacement by RM in the cement manufacturing process and understanding the modifications in mechanical and microstructural properties of concrete when RM is partially used to replace the OPC-based binder. The analysis was approached through articles published in reputed journals, which were traced using the keywords ‘red mud as cement replacement’.  From these, articles pertaining to the cementitious construction materials domain were selected. Articles about the fresh, hardened, mechanical, and durability properties of RM-based cementitious materials were analyzed, refined, and carefully documented in this paper. Critical comparisons involving the performance of these new materials with regard to the above-mentioned important parameters were made and statistically compiled to extract crucial and decisive trends in RM utilization backed up by various standard tests on the fresh, mechanical, durability, thermal, and microstructural properties to support our conclusions. Based on the result of the investigation, attempts were made to identify the extent of utilization of RM to replace binders in various cementitious materials and evaluate the mechanical, environmental, and economic performance of mixes incorporating RM. The paper concludes by opening the possibility of replacing a considerable proportion of cement with RM giving researchers a clear and vivid idea of this eco-friendly and sustainable substitute in the cement industry. The methodology used for the study is briefly illustrated in Fig. 6  .  4 Properties of cementitious materials 4.1 Pozzolanic activity Tsakiridis et al. [34]  and Manfroi et al. [35]  analyzed the pozzolanic activity of RM by monitoring the amount of free lime in the cement pastes. Tsakiridis et al. [34]  observed that for the cement clinkers containing 3.5% RM as cement replacement, increasing the temperature at which RM is sintered, the amount of free lime decreases, leading to the formation of a well-burnt clinker, thus increasing pozzolanic activity. Manfroi et al. [35]  studied the pozzolanic behavior of RM by formulating pastes that contained 50% RM particles and 50% calcium hydroxide by weight and calcinated these mixes at different temperatures. The results indicated that at a higher temperature, the consumption of calcium hydroxide by the RM particles decreases, signifying lower pozzolanic activity. By looking at the mechanisms of both the processes above, it can be concluded that the presence of oxygen while heating helps increase the reactivity of RM particles. Senff et al. [36]  studied the pozzolanic activity of RM by finding the concentrations of hydroxyl ions and calcium ions and noted that the RM particles had some capacity to fix the calcium ions present in the aqueous solution. These can be used as a substitute for OPC in mortars. Romano et al. [37]  also noted the consumption of lime by RM particles and found that the value was much lower than 700 mg and cannot be considered a pozzolanic material. It is also pointed out from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis that RM reacts with hydrated lime, forming calcium aluminate hydrate (CAH), a non-pozzolanic reaction. For self-compacting concrete (SCC) mixes, when RM was utilized to replace flyash (FA), its pozzolanic activity was measured in terms of the strength activity index by Liu et al. [38] . The pozzolanic activity of RM is roughly equal to that of FA. RM contains many active elements, and its internal curing ability enhances the compressive strength, hence the result.  4.2 Setting time Raj et al. [39]  noted that the setting time of cement pastes slightly decreases on incorporating RM up to 10% as cement replacement and then increases. Increasing the amount of RM increases the water demanded by the mix to obtain standard consistency. Beyond 10% replacement of cement by RM, the setting time increases due to the reduction in the density of the mix. Tsakiridis et al. [34]  also observed that the setting time of cement pastes slightly decreased when RM was used to replace cement by 3.5%. Yao et al. [40]  noted that adding 15% RM increases the setting time of cement, but it is still within the acceptable range. However, Wang et al. [41]  noted that on substituting 23% cement with RM, there is a slight decrease in the setting time. In the study by Romano et al. [37] , adding RM only slightly influences the setting time of the rapid hardening type of cement (CPIII) and sulphate resisting cement (CPV), whereas in Romano et al. [19] , adding RM increases the setting time of both CPIII and CPV cement mixes significantly. The chemical properties of the cement and the RM are the same in Romano et al. [37]  and Romano et al. [19]  studies, but the heat flow curve shows slight variation. Thus, the difference in particle size distribution and the physical properties of RM and cement used might be the reason behind the anomaly. The setting time of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is also seen to decrease with an increase in substitution of cement by RM due to the high alkalinity and fineness of RM, making it a potential nucleation point for hydrates, thus accelerating the hydration process [42] . Fig. 7  . Shows the setting time results from various studies.  4.3 Slump test Past studies reveal that incorporating RM as a binder component in concrete decreases the slump flow values, i.e., the workability of the mixes. RM particles possess many cracks and pores on their surfaces to store more free water. Hence they absorb the water added to achieve the necessary workability leading to a reduction in slump flow diameter with increasing substitution of fly ash by RM in SCC binders [44–46] . Hence, increasing RM content in SCC mixtures increases the superplasticizers needed to maintain workability [38] . However, it was noted that the workability of SCC mixes slightly increases when 100% of the fly ash used was replaced by RM as compared to the value of slump obtained at 75% replacement, but the workability is still much lower than the control mix where RM has not been used [47] . On the other hand, due to the large surface area of RM compared to cement, the mixes where RM replaced cement by up to 10% showed a decrease in workability. Also, the slump values reduced on replacing cement by RM up to 20% in concrete mixes. RM being lighter in weight than cement and the particles being finer, occupies more volume and absorb higher water, reducing flowability [48] . In combination with RM, the filler particle used also determined the workability. For the same RM content, the SCC mixes with marble powder showed greater slump flow diameters than the ones containing lime powder and granite powder [49] . In the case of mortars, the study by Yang et al. [50]  shows that a decrease in slump value is noted on incorporating RM as partial cement substitution, which was attributed to the higher plastic viscosity of RM mortars. Hou et al. [42]  also noted that replacing cement with RM in UHPC decreases workability, limiting its use in complex structures. Fig. 8   illustrates the slump flow dimeters of SCC mixes containing RM.  4.4 Consistency and flow table test Raj et al. [39]  observed that the water requirement of cement pastes is directly proportional to the percentage increase in RM, which in turn arises due to the increase in the number of finer particles on incorporating RM. Manfroi et al. [35]  also noted a slight increase in consistency when RM replaced 3.5% of the cement. But, in the study where 23% RM was used to replace cement, Wang et al. [41]  noted that the water requirement slightly decreased. This might be due to the difference in the properties of the RM used. Senff et al. [51]  noted that the flow table spread diameter of mortars decreases with an increase in the percentage of RM used. The fineness of the RM particles increases the cohesion of the mixture, reducing the fluidity of the blend. In the study by Senff et al. [36] , the decrease in flow diameters was attributed to the higher surface area, greater wettability, and the strong Van der Waal force between RM particles, implying a higher agglomeration tendency. Yao et al. [40]  also noted a slight decrease in fluidity on incorporating 15% RM in cement mixes.  4.5 J Ring and T-500 tests When RM was used to replace FA in SCC binders, the J ring diameters decreased with increasing quantities of RM. As mentioned earlier, this is because RM being porous in nature, absorbs much water, and more superplasticizers were needed to maintain the required flowability [38,44,47]  also noted a decrease in the J ring diameters on replacing FA with RM is SCC. The t-500 results showed a decrease in viscosity on adding RM, as the superplasticizer content was highly increased with RM addition. Ghalehnovi et al. [52]  assessed that adding RM up to 7.5% to replace cement in SCC reduced its passing ability. Nevertheless, it was still suitable for use in heavily reinforced structures having complex shapes. From the t-500 test results, Ghalehnovi et al. [49]  also concluded that adding RM up to 10% to replace cement in SCC decreased workability due to the large surface area and high porosity of RM particles, which is in accordance with the studies mentioned above.  4.6 L box and V funnel Alike the other workability tests, the L box and V funnel tests conducted for SCC mixes containing RM also showed a decrease in flowability. Ghalehnovi et al. [52]  and Ghalehnovi et al. [49]  noted that the L-box ratio decreases and the V-funnel time increase with an increase in the quantity of RM used to replace cement in SCC. These findings were attributed to the greater fineness of RM compared to cement increasing the surface area, leading to decreased free water availability, higher viscosity, and less plasticity of the fresh mix. Using RM to replace FA in SCC also showed a similar trend for V funnel and L box tests due to the increase in the cohesiveness of the mix [38,46] . A significant increase in the V funnel flow time was also noted for mortars formulated using RM owing to its high plastic viscosity and absorption properties of RM, increasing the entrapped air content [50] .  4.7 Fresh and hardened density When RM was used to replace cement in lightweight concrete (LWC) and SCC, the fresh density of mixes decreased owing to the lower specific gravity of RM compared to cement [52,53] . A decrease in the fresh dry density was also noted when RM was used to replace fillers in SCC mixes. Concrete mixes containing RM as cement replacement also showed a slight reduction in the values of fresh density [54] . Liu et al. [38]  and Liu et al. [46]  observed that the hardened density of SCC mixes also decreased when RM replaced FA, and this was probably due to the lower specific gravity of RM compared to FA. This can also be due to the large number of pores and cracks on the surfaces of the particles of RM.  4.8 Shrinkage and strain Adding 23% RM to field road base cement clinkers, the 28 days drying shrinkage percentage is noted to be doubled compared to the cement clinkers containing no RM. The reason behind this observation is the higher content of C4 AF in the former [41] . Using RM to replace cement up to 40% in mortars increases unrestrained shrinkage values [36] . Liu et al. [38]  evaluated the effect of using RM up to 40% to replace FA (binder) in SCC mixes and found that drying shrinkage decreases with an increase in replacement. The early age (up to 7 days) shrinkage values were almost similar to the control sample, and the differences were prominent in the later stages due to the internal curing ability of RM, i.e., due to the porous nature, RM initially absorbs a huge quantity of free water which later migrates from RM to the concrete. Contrary to this, Liu et al. [46]  noted that the drying shrinkage increases with an increase in RM as FA replacement in SCC. The reason behind this anomaly might be the lesser cross-section of the samples tested (25*25 mm2 ) here compared to the previous one (70*70 mm2 ), due to which less free water was lost. However, the autonomous shrinkage first decreases up to 50% replacement level and later increases up to 100% replacement. The initial reduction was due to the porous nature of RM after pre-soaking in water. The autogenous shrinkage strain of these also increases with the increase in RM.  4.9 Compressive strength The compressive strength of mortars first increases to a certain replacement level of cement by RM and later shows a decreasing trend [55,56] . Chen et al. [56]  noted that the 28-day compressive strength was enhanced when RM was used up to 25% to replace cement in gangue backfill paste . Higher ettringite formation is responsible for this increase. Wang et al. [41]  noted that 23% RM could replace cement in road base material, providing higher strength. The initial compressive strength of the RM sample is found to be less than that of the control mix, but the 28 days strength is higher. The C4 AF phase in the RM sample had a lower Al/Fe ratio of 0.5, which slows the hydration rate in the early stages. Venkatesh et al. [57]  found that the compressive strength of concrete enhances up to 12.5% cement replacement and then starts decreasing. The decrease was attributed to the insufficient pozzolanic reaction between RM and other minerals, reducing calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) formation, which majorly contributes to strength. Similarly, Chavan et al. [48]  noted that replacing cement up to 12% with RM in concrete mixes led to an increase in strength, and a similar trend was observed for both split tensile strength and flexural strength. Venkatesh et al. [58]  also found that compressive strength increases for concrete samples containing RM up to 10%. Viyasun et al. [59]  observed a rather different trend. The compressive strength of cement cubes decreased by replacing 10% OPC with RM, but an enhancement was observed when RM was used to replace 20% cement. This was attributed to increased pressure quality and bond between the cement and aggregate, but further replacement decreased strength. Senff et al. [36]  observed that RM-containing mortars had a lower compressive strength, which was reduced with the increase in RM. RM acts as a filler, but its pozzolanic activity was too low compared to cement to account for the decrease in hydration products. Hence a decrease in strength is observed. It is also noted that increasing the w/c ratio significantly reduces strength due to the increase in apparent porosity. A similar trend in the w/c ratio was also obtained for the concrete samples tested by Venkatesh et al. [58] . Senff et al. [51]  noticed that for mortars, substituting cement with RM reduces strength due to its lower chemical reactivity and pozzolanic activity, but for low level (7.1% by weight) of replacement, reducing the w/c ratio can effectively compensate for the reduction. When 30% RM is used, due to its porous nature, it absorbs a huge amount of water, leaving insufficient water available for hydration, thus reducing strength [30] .  Nikbin et al. [53]  also noted a decrease in strength on adding RM to replace cement in LWC mixtures and found that the RM-containing samples gained most of the strength at the early stages as the RM used had an Al/Fe ratio of 0.64 and accelerated the early hydration process. Even for the UHPC, substituting cement with RM led to a decrease in the compressive strength values [42] . However, Zhang et al. [60]  noted that when RM replaced OPC up to 20% in mortars, there was a strength enhancement due to an increase in the formation of hydration products, as seen in FTIR analysis. Anirudh et al. [61]  also noted an increase in the compressive strength of mortars on replacing cement by up to 10%. The alkalinity of RM helps develop good pozzolanic activity, playing a significant role in cement hydration. Manfroi et al. [35]  noted that adding 5% RM calcined at various temperatures, ranging from 600 to 800 °C, to the concrete mortars showed similar strength values as the control sample, whereas higher RM content showed a decrease in compressive strength. However, an improvement in strength was observed in the calcination of the RM samples at 900 °C. Though the samples calcined at 900 °C have a lower pozzolanic activity than the others, it greatly contributes to the filler effect, improving strength. Luo et al. [30]  also noted the effect of calcination for incorporating RM up to 30% in cement pastes. In the early stages, samples containing uncalcined and the 1000 °C calcined RM showed higher strength than the cement paste. Later, only the sample containing 15% calcined RM had a higher compressive strength. On calcinating at 1000 °C, new phases like Nepheline and Gehlenite are formed, which possess self-strength, thus enhancing strength. To study the impact of thermal treatment more prominently, Venkatesh et al. [58]  recorded the strength values of concrete samples by replacing cement with both treated RM (thermally treated at 600 °C for 2 hrs) and untreated RM. The untreated RM samples showed strength enhancement only up to 5% replacement levels, whereas the treated one showed up to 10%, owing to the enhanced pozzolanic and chemical activity and higher availability of SiO2 , TiO2,  and Al2 O3  in RM. The type of filler used along with RM also affects the strength gain. Ghalehnovi et al. [49]  showed that for the SCC mixes containing lime powder as filler, RM addition of up to 2.5% improves strength, whereas adding RM to samples containing granite powder and marble powder, strength decreases. However, the samples containing granite powder and marble powder still show higher strength values than the lime samples due to the extended particle size distribution, i.e., fineness of the former. Optimizing FA content and adding it along with RM can also improve strength. Kumar et al. [62]  showed that in the concrete samples in which cement is replaced by RM dosage varying up to 24% and a constant FA replacement level of 8%, the compressive strength is highest for the sample containing 8% RM and then gradually decreases. However, the strength of all the RM-containing samples was higher than the control. But higher FA content than this increased friction between the pozzolanic particles, decreasing the strength slightly. Fig. 9   shows the compressive strength results when cement is replaced by RM. Liu et al. [46]  noted that utilizing RM to replace the FA content in an SCC binder increases strength up to 50% replacement level due to the synergic effect of higher pozzolanic activity compared to FA and the internal curing ability of RM. A further addition decreases strength due to a reduction in the free water available for the hydration of mixes. Similar results were also observed by Liu et al. [38]  for up to 40% replacement levels in SCC. However, in the study by Tang et al. [44]  and Tang et al. [47] , in SCC, FA can be completely replaced by RM with an enhancement in strength. The increase in strength was due to the presence of a large amount of hatrurite in the cement matrix and sodium atoms in RM, influencing the morphology and network formation of CSH gel. An illustration of the above results is shown in Fig. 10  . Sun et al. [64]  noted that RM (nearly 30%) calcined along with oil shale is also suitable for preparing cement mixes, and the temperature at which the oil shale is calcined affects compressive strength. The mix containing oil shale calcined at 400 °C showed a small degree of Si-Al distortion, reducing strength, whereas the one containing oil shale calcined at 700 °C showed high strength as a higher content of Si-Al reacts with RM, leading to faster setting, improving strength. A new cementitious material containing 15% RM in combination with coal refuse and FA (15% each) as OPC replacement in cement mortars was noted to have high compressive strength after 180 days of curing owing to the pozzolanic reaction between the blended solid byproducts [40] . In preparing red-colored cement mortars using RM, Yang et al. [50]  noted that adding RM up to 6% increases compressive strength. The increase is attributed to the (i) filler effect of RM, forming a dense microstructure, (ii) amorphous structure of RM, facilitating hydration of C3 S and C2 S, and (iii) the higher amounts of Al2 O3 , Fe2 O3 , SiO2  and CaO present in RM, generating CSH gel and ettringite to a higher degree.  4.10 Split tensile strength The trend observed for split tensile strength was mostly similar to the trend of compressive strength observations. Venkatesh et al. [57]  and Venkatesh et al. [63]  observed that the split tensile strength of concrete samples first increases up to RM addition of 12.5%, and then there is a trend reversal. Due to the finer particle size, RM acts as a filler, minimizing micro cracks and thus helping improve strength. Nikbin et al. [53]  noted the decrease in the strength of LWC on RM addition due to the lower pozzolanic activity of RM compared to cement. Shetty et al. [55]  and Yang et al. [50]  also noticed a decrease in strength for SCC and cement mortars, respectively. Yang et al. [50]  stated that the porous nature of RM causes the adsorption of some re-dispersible emulsion powder, thus lowering strength. Slightly different from the compressive strength behavior, Ghalehnovi et al. [49]  noted that the tensile strength of SCC mixes increases for RM addition by 2.5% and decreases irrespective of the filler type. The slight increase in split tensile values seen at later curing stages is due to the internal curing ability of RM. This finding is in accordance with the study conducted by Ghalehnovi et al. [52]  for SCC mixes. RM can be efficiently utilized to replace FA in SCC binders, as only slight differences exist in the split tensile values of all the samples studied [47] . Liu et al. [38]  observed for SCC that the strength of RM samples up to 40% FA replacement was lower than the control at 28 and 56 days, but a longer curing period of 90 days helped obtain higher strength. Tang et al. [47]  also noted that RM could completely replace fly ash with no deterioration in strength. The strength results by various researchers have been compiled in Fig. 11  .  4.11 Flexural strength The flexural strength noted by Venkatesh et al. [57]  showed a similar trend to the compressive and tensile strength, i.e., increased up to 12.5% of cement replacement by RM. This increase was attributed to the alkaline nature of RM, which promotes the formation of CSH gel. Viyasun et al. [59]  and Venkatesh et al. [63]  also noted that the compressive strength and flexural trend on RM addition were similar (Fig. 12  ). Venkatesh et al. [57]  also showed that the flexural strength increases for RM addition up to 10% and the strength decrease when cured for 56 days as compared to the 28 days strength. The chemical composition of RM, when added up to 10%, leads to the formation of more hydration products, and higher heat of hydration is noted. However, on further RM addition, due to the fine particle size of RM, less water is available for hydration, leading to fewer chemical reactions between RM and cement. Examining mortars with different w/b ratios, the strength obtained for the series having a lower w/b ratio was lower, as the water available was insufficient to hydrate the cement, and less chemical reaction occurred between the particles. Wang et al. [41]  noted that RM could replace OPC by 23% in the road base cement mix, with an enhancement in flexural strength, irrespective of the curing period. Contrarily, Yao et al. [40] , Yang et al. [50] , and Nikbin et al. [53]  noted that the 28 days flexural strength of samples decreased upon adding RM, irrespective of the quantity added. However, the study by Yao et al. [40]  increased after longer curing due to the pozzolanic reaction between the blended byproducts (coal refuse, fly ash, and RM). Kılınçkale et al. [65]  observed the flexural strength of the metal-loaded concrete blocks where RM replaces up to 30% of the cement. Adequate strength can be obtained for up to 20% of metal loading, and copper-loaded sorbents were the most affected, showing values lower than cadmium-loaded samples.  4.12 Elastic modulus Chen et al. [56]  noted that when RM is utilized to replace cement in gangue cemented paste backfill, the elastic modulus increases until 25% replacement and decreases. However, the studies by Nikbin et al. [53]  and Ghalehnovi et al. [52]  indicate that the elastic modulus decreases with an increase in RM content when used to replace cement in LWC and SCC, respectively. Nikbin et al. [53]  suggested that adding RM leads to a decrease in the total aggregate volume, lowering the stiffness of the concrete mix, and this fall in Young’s modulus is noted. Ghalehnovi et al. [52]  attributed the low pozzolanic activity of RM compared to cement to cause a decrease in SCC samples. The elastic modulus trend slightly increased when RM replaced FA content in SCC [38,44] .   5 Water absorption and porosity With an increase in RM content to substitute cement, there is an increase in water absorption [51,53] . This increase is stated to be due to the higher porosity of RM particles, and the high increase rate with increasing RM content confirms the non-hydraulic character of RM. Ghalehnovi et al. [49]  also noted an increase in water absorption of the SCC mixes when RM was used to replace cement, and it was attributed to the presence of “pits” and “folds” on the surface of RM, increasing absorption. A higher absorption was observed for samples containing marble powder as filler than the lime powder and granite powder samples, which showed similar values. Senff et al. [36]  observed that an increase in RM content in cement mortars increases both apparent porosity and water absorption; however, the rate of increase decreases with curing time owing to the progress in the hydration process and due to the occurrence of potential carbonation reactions. The series formulated using a higher w/b ratio, i.e., 0.58, showed higher absorption and porosity, signifying that though RM alters the formation of CSH gel, the w/b ratio induces greater changes. There is no significant difference in the series having a lower w/b ratio, i.e., 0.47, due to the development of a similar internal porous structure. For SCC, Ghalehnovi et al. [52]  also showed that water absorption increases with an increase in RM content and decreases with curing time. It is suggested that the lower pozzolanic activity of RM delays hydration and results in a more porous network, increasing absorptivity. Fig. 13   represents the absorption percentage of various researchers in their work. However, Venkatesh et al. [63]  and Viyasun et al. [59]  noted that the water absorption decreases in concrete samples when the percentage of cement replacement by RM increases. Venkatesh et al. [63]  attributed the change to the finer particle nature of RM, which offers higher resistance to the passage of water and gases. Anirudh et al. [61]  also noted a similar trend in increasing cement replacement levels up to 20% in concrete mortars and attributed the observations to the void-filling ability of RM due to its finer size. Manfroi et al. [35]  observed the effect of adding RM calcined at different temperatures by measuring the sorptivity of the designed cement mortars. For 5% RM incorporation, the sorptivity values of all the samples, irrespective of the calcination temperature, were lower than the reference due to lower pore connectivity and smaller crystals in RM mortars. Increasing RM content led to an increase in sorptivity, but the values were lower for the samples calcined at 900 °C due to the filler effect of RM and the CSH gel formation, which tends to fill pores. He also noted the apparent wetting angle showing higher wettability on increasing RM content except for the 900 °C calcined mortars. Contrary to the findings mentioned above, Venkatesh et al. [57]  noted that increasing the level of RM up to 15% in concrete mixes reduces absorption. The test concrete mortars contain a small amount of (10%) metakaolin which, together with RM, fills the micro-pores present, reducing absorption. Liu et al. [38]  noted that adding excess RM to replace FA in SCC increases porosity. This is because RM has a zeolitic character and increases viscosity. Liu et al. [46]  ascertained the above. He also noted that the number of permeable voids increases with increasing replacement. 5.1 Durability Díaz et al. [66]  studied the migration of chloride ions by natural diffusion test and noted that the migration and average diffusion coefficient reduced with the increase in RM in the cement pastes. From the Mercury intrusion porosimeter, it is seen that incorporating RM splits the family of pores into smaller pores, obstructing the transport phenomena of chloride ions. From the differential scanning calorimetry test, the reduction in chloride ion diffusion was found to be due to the alkaline nature of RM, which limits the dissolution of portlandite (CH), and the aluminium present in RM reacts to the chloride ions, forming Friedel’s salt. Yao et al. [40]  also noted that the chloride penetration for a cementitious material decreases by adding 15% RM along with coal refuse and FA. Using RM up to 15% in concrete increases the sample's resistance to chloride ion penetration as it helps arrest micro-cracks and form a denser structure [57] . Resistance to chloride ion penetration is seen to increase with an increase in RM content and concrete curing time due to improved hydration and decrease with an increase in w/c ratio [51,54] . For UHPC samples, Hou et al. [42]  noted an increase in the resistance to chloride ion penetration with the increase in RM content, and this enhanced durability was attributed to the filling effect of RM. In agreement with the previous results, Venkatesh et al. [63]  also noted a decrease in the amount of charge passing through RM-containing samples, i.e., a decrease in chloride migration, improving durability characteristics (Fig. 14  ). Serdar et al. [54]  observed that on using 20% RM in combination with FA and quarry dust in concrete, the chloride migration coefficient decreases due to the decreased tortuosity, better pore diameter distribution and the chemical composition of RM which is favorable to form compounds on reaction with chloride ions. However, it is noted that the chloride migration coefficient increases when using only FA and 15% RM in concrete. Ghalehnovi et al. [52]  noted that replacing cement with RM in SCC shows better resistance to sulphate attack. This is due to the micro filler effect of RM. It is also found that on replacing the filler in SCC with RM, sulphate resistance increases because it reduces the volume of fine aggregates owing to the higher specific gravity of RM compared with filler. Contrarily, Ghalehnovi et al. [49]  noted that the SCC mixes containing RM showed lower resistance to sulphuric acid attack as RM is a porous material with many voids. The anomaly can be attributed to the difference in the physical and chemical properties of the RM used. Nikbin et al. [53]  showed that the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) decreases with increased RM content to replace cement in LWC. Ghalehnovi et al. [49]  also inferred that when RM was used to replace cement in SCC mixes, UPV decreased irrespective of the filler type used. This decrease was attributed to the zeolitic nature of RM, due to which the heat of hydration decreases, consequently decreasing velocity. Unlike UPV, Ghalehnovi et al. [49]  showed that the electrical resistivity results varied based on the type of filler material used, increasing for lime powder and marble powder and decreasing for granite powder when RM is incorporated. The finer size of RM particles and their internal curing ability improved resistivity in the previous cases. For the marble powder specimens, the pore connectivity or the comparatively higher mean particle size might be the factors behind the difference in trend. Serdar et al. [54]  noted similar results for concrete resistivity as the chloride ion penetration discussed earlier. Díaz et al. [66]  observed that the carbonation coefficient decreases for cement pastes containing RM, i.e., it hinders CO2  penetration into the samples, just like the results of the chloride ion penetration. The alkaline nature of RM assists in CO2  retention. On replacing OPC with RM in mortars, Senff et al. [36]  found a decrease in Ca(OH)2 formed and less extended CSH formation, which reduces carbonation extent in both natural and accelerated forms carbonation conditions. He also specified that the w/b ratio has a greater impact on carbonation than RM, increasing with the increase in the w/b ratio. Noting the pH, Raj et al. [39]  observed that increasing the percentage replacement of RM in cement paste leads to an increase in the pH due to the alkaline nature of RM. The alkali-silica reaction (ASR) test conducted by Senff et al. [36]  showed that adding RM reduced the expansion of the mortars as RM particles are fine and have lower pozzolanic activity as compared to that cement. He also stated that the RM-containing samples having a higher w/b ratio leads to a more porous structure and effectively controls the expansive reactions by accommodating them in their voids. Yao et al. [40]  similarly showed a decrease in the percentage of expansion of the cement pastes containing 15% RM. Like the other durability properties, RM also improved the concrete’s resistance to freeze and thaw action. Yao et al. [40]  noted for cement that the loss of relative dynamic modulus for RM samples was less than that of normal cement, and the dynamic modulus was greater for the former irrespective of the number of freeze and thaw cycles it was subjected to, affirming the high durability of RM sample. By measuring the loss in compressive strength and the weight loss, Ghalehnovi et al. [52]  noted that the increase of RM content in SCC to replace cement up to 7.5% leads to lesser weight loss but the higher loss of compressive strength when subjected to freeze–thaw cycles. The poor compressive strength performance could be attributed to the fact that increasing RM increases the number of fine particles and increases the occurrence of these particles in the interfacial transition zone (ITZ), weakening the bond between aggregates and hardened cement paste.  5.2 Leaching As per the leaching test observations, RM in calcined and dry form is a hazardous waste in which chromium and selenium exceed the safety limits. The cement mortars without RM have high cadmium levels, which is also hazardous. However, RM has less cadmium than cement. Though hazardous, incorporating RM up to 10% advantageously reduces the leached concentration of cadmium as the hydration products contribute to the fixation of contaminants, especially cadmium [35] . Yao et al. [40]  noted the toxicity characteristic leaching of mortars by replacing the cement with 15% RM, 15% coal refuse, and 15% FA and found that none of the hazardous elements exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits. The formulated mortars significantly reduced chromium leaching showing a good stabilization/ solidification ability of the heavy metal. Here, the coal refuse introduced has a certain amount of hematite which incorporates chromium. Yang et al. [50]  noted the heavy metal leaching toxicity of mortars containing RM up to 9% by the sulphuric-nitric acid method and found that incorporating RM leads to an increase in the leaching of chromium, cadmium, zinc, nickel, copper, and lead, but they are well below the prescribed limits and hence can be used as cement replacement from the leaching point of view.  5.3 XRD The diffractograms of the raw RM showed the presence of haematite, calcite, gibbsite, quartz, rutile, perovskite, and hydrogarnet as the major phases [39] . Goethite and anatose were also some major phases observed in the raw material [19,34,37]  (Fig. 15  ). Certain variations exist in the mineralogical nature of RM as studied by various researchers. These differences are due to the varying sources from which bauxite is procured and the difference in the method of alumina production. Tsakiridis et al. [34]  observed that the major mineralogical phases for cement clinker were C3 S, C2 S, C4 AF, and C3 A, and adding RM up to 3.5% did not affect the phases much. However, adding RM to cement reduced the amount of C3 A, thereby increasing C4 AF formation due to the higher availability of iron and aluminum. The same was quoted by Wang et al. [41] , where RM replaced 23% of cement to produce road base material. For the cement mixes by Singh et al. [67] , an increase in RM content led to increased C2 F and C4 AF phases, decreasing C3 A. XRD results of cement pastes containing RM calcined at various temperatures, i.e., 600 to 900 °C, revealed the presence of CSH, calcium CAH, AFm phase (monosulphate), ettringite, and CH as the major hydrated phases [35] . The growth in the hydration products of the mixes containing RM up to 15% and calcined at 900 °C was attributed to the fine particle size of RM, which settles between cement particles leaving more space available for the growth of hydration products. Thus, the 900 °C calcined mixes containing RM showed the highest compressive strength values. Chen et al. [56]  noted the formation of the hydration mentioned above products along with some other products like gismondine and hydrocalumite for RM cement paste backfill prepared by partial substitution of cement by RM (Fig. 16  ). Ettringite and CSH gel formed here was the hydration products majorly influencing the compressive strength. Higher RM content in concrete mix leads to higher ion concentration, increasing the formation of hydration products. Hatrurite (C3 S) and larnite (C2 S) in RM are responsible for enhancing the formation of CSH gel [58,61] . Yang et al. [50]  found that with an increase in RM content up to 9% in making coloured concrete, the peak intensity of SiO2  increases, accompanied by a decrease in the CH peak. This result is ascribed to the active substances in RM, which react with CH. Liu et al. [68]  also observed that the cementitious mixes prepared using RM and oil shale have ettringite, quartz, and CSH as the major constituents of the hydration products. It was noted that the quartz peak was sharper for the mixes calcined at lower temperatures, whereas more ettringite was formed for the higher ones [64] . On using RM as FA replacement in cement production, Singh et al. [67]  reported an increase in non-hydraulic phases like C2 F, which adversely affected strength properties. In UHPC, Hou et al. [42]  noted a decrease in the peak intensity of CH with increasing RM content, indicating the pozzolanic behavior of RM.  5.4 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) Increasing the quantity of RM to replace cement reduced internal voids due to its finer particle size, causing agglomeration. The number of hydration products greatly increased, with the overlapping of the flocculent gels and rod-like structure, forming densely structured cement pastes and mortars [50,56] . Venkatesh et al. [57]  also revealed the densification of the concrete structure for RM addition of up to 15%. Chavan et al. [48]  also similarly observed that the SEM images of concrete samples containing 12% RM were comparatively dense with uniformly finer CSH gel, and air voids were not observed, but the cracks and air voids were observed when the replacement level was increased to 20%, which also justifies the strength behavior observed for the concrete samples. However, Tang et al. [44]  found in SCC that the micro-cracks increased with increasing RM to replace FA content up to 50% due to its porous nature, which is the reason behind the decrease in tensile strength. But analyzing the ITZ of the samples showed similar porosity and micro-cracks for the RM samples compared to the cement mix, leading to the similar compressive strength of all samples. Three phases exist in the hydrated samples, i.e., the alite phase, the belite phase, and the liquid phase. On adding RM by 23% in hydrated cement specimens, the size of the alite crystal and the amount of liquid phase present is seen to be more than the control sample containing cement alone [41] . The above is in accordance with the results of optical microscopy of the cement clinkers as seen by Tsakiridis et al. [34]  with an additional observation that the belite phase becomes evenly distributed on adding RM, compared to the nested form in control clinkers. The SEM images of cementitious material observed by Yao et al. [40]  showed that the early hydration of the RM sample includes a large degree of ettringite and CH crystallization along with CSH gel formation. Luo et al. [30]  found that after 28 days of curing, the ettringite formed earlier gets transformed into the monosulphate phase, forming a dense layer of CASH, thereby reducing the amount of ettringite. The above finding is attributed to the dilution effect caused by RM. The CSH gel, or the CASH gel, later contributes to the stabilization/ solidification process. Hematite which does not react in RM exists in the form of large particles [69] . When RM was combined with oil shale to form a cementitious material, SEM images revealed that no un-reaction zone prevailed at the interface between grains and the matrix around the particles [64] . Calcinating oil shale at higher temperatures led to a weakening of [SiO4 ] and [AlO4 ] tetrahedrons of the oil shale, increasing the rate of hydration.  5.5 SEM - energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) Using SEM-EDS, Liu et al. [70]  analyzed the CSH phase formed for the hydrated cementitious material after 90 days of curing. It showed that the samples containing RM had a lower Ca/ Si ratio and higher Al/ Si ratio than those with more clinker. The substitution percentage of Si by Al increases with the increased RM content. Using RM to substitute FA and cement in concrete mixes has decreased the Ca/ Si ratio due to the higher quantity of aluminum and iron and lower calcium oxides present in RM [57,58] . A lower Ca/Si ratio indicates stable C–S–H gel formation. The C–S–H is observed to have a reticular structure and forms a dense microstructure. A similar trend was also inferred from the elemental results of EDS conducted by Tang et al. [44]  (Fig. 17  ). An increase in sodium and iron level with replacement was also observed. This high sodium content is because bauxite is causticized to extract alumina by Bayer’s process. A combination of RM with oil shale also depicts a decrease in the Ca/Si ratio, increasing sodium content in the cement mix [68] . The authors believe that CASH gel with a lower Ca/Si ratio will promote the solidification of sodium ions.  5.6 Fourier transform InfraRed (FTIR) Chen et al. [56]  noted the differences in the chemical structure of gangue cemented paste backfill when RM replaced 25% of the cement. RM provides a strongly alkaline environment that breaks the Si-O and Al-O bonds, and they react to the silica oxides in glass, producing higher CSH and CAH. The chemical equations are as follows:(1) SiO2  + Ca(OH)2  + H2 O → CaO · SiO2 ·xH2 O   (2) Al2 O3  + Ca(OH)2  + H2 O → CaO · Al2 O3 ·xH2 O   (3) Al2 O3  + Ca(OH)2  + 2SiO2  + 3H2 O → CaO · Al2 O3  · 2SiO3 ·4H2 O    Analyzing the XRD, the absorption peaks observed here are also attributed to the ettringite vibration peaks. Romano et al. [19]  noted that the cement pastes containing 10% RM as cement replacement leads to the formation of amorphous aluminosilicates. A higher rise in intensity was noted for samples containing RM, indicating the higher formation of ettringite and monosulfoaluminate. It can be inferred that using RM leads to a higher polymerization reaction of carbonates and silicates, which agrees with the study by Chen et al. [56] .  5.7 Magic-Angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) In the study by Liu et al. [70] , the Al-MAS NMR results showed that unreacted clinker usually contains aluminum in four coordinated states. The samples containing less RM have a higher Ca/Si ratio, promoting the conversion of Al(IV) to Al(VI). Increasing RM content indicates more tetrahedral bonded [AlO4 ] and [SiO4 ], forming a higher amount of CASH gel. He also observed from the Si-MAS NMR that with the increase in hydration time, the polymerization degree of [SiO4 ] increases (Fig. 18  ). In the mix containing oil shale, Liu et al. [68]  noted that increasing oil shale, i.e., reducing the overall RM content also led to an increase in tetrahedrally coordinated Al. An interlinking between tetrahedral AlO4  and SiO4  takes place by sharing oxygen atoms, and the negative charge of tetrahedral units is balanced by the alkali metal cations present in the mix. X-ray photoelectron microscope (XPS) results confirmed those mentioned above. Sun et al. [64]  noted the effect of varying the calcination temperature of oil shale incorporated in the mix. It noted that the samples calcined at higher temperatures (700 °C) only contain tetrahedrally coordinated Al, and the Si-Al tetrahedron is not regularly ordered, exhibiting a broader resonance peak compared to the low-temperature calcined mix.  5.8 Thermal properties Manfroi et al. [35]  identified the hydrated phases obtained for the cement pastes containing RM particles up to 15% replacement, calcined at various temperatures (600 to 900 °C). The endothermic peak corresponding to the CSH and CAH gel and the one corresponding to the gibbsite are seen to be greater for the samples containing RM calcined at lower temperatures (600 °C). This is very less with no gibbsite for the sample containing RM calcined at 900 °C. The thermograms of reference cement pastes do not exhibit such peaks. The consumption of CH forms these phases, and thus with the lowering of the phases mentioned above, the residual CH peak due to the presence of calcium oxides in cement is observed. Romano et al. [37]  observed the heat flow of cement pastes containing RM up to 20% using an isothermal conduction calorimeter. The first hydration stage is characterized by a quick increase in the heat released due to wetting and neutralizing the electric charges, and ettringite is formed. Increasing the RM content leads to an increase in the alkalinity of the paste, as a result of which a greater amount of Al is available, intensifying the formation of ettringite. The heat flow peak increases with increased RM, and the hydration process is initiated quicker for these samples than in the reference cement mix. The author noticed the changes for two different cement types, Brazilian cement type CPIII (containing slag) and CPV, and it was observed that a higher heat flow takes place for the CPV as CPIII has less clinker. In the study conducted by Romano et al. [19] , the author observed that adding 10% RM to the various types of cement pastes leads to an increase in the induction period as RM’s chemical composition shows the presence of large quantities of aluminum, which has an inhibitory effect on the dissolution process. The cumulative heat was also found to be higher for RM-containing pastes. Senff et al. [51]  used the quasi-adiabatic calorimeter and monitored the temperature of hydration of mortars containing RM as cement replacement up to 50%. The observations here were different from those of the cement pastes, i.e., it was found that RM did not accelerate the hydration process. For samples containing RM up to 15%, the fineness of RM particles helps it act as a heterogeneous chemical activation nucleus for the hydration of cement. Thus no noticeable changes in the heat flow curve are observed, but a further increase in RM content leads to a decrease in the maximum temperature of hydration. Similarly, Senff et al. [36]  noticed that adding RM to replace cement in mortars decreased the maximum value of the exothermic peak as a natural reflex to reducing OPC content. However, for mortars containing RM up to 10%, the changes were invariable compared to the reference mortar. The research also discussed the effect of superplasticizer for the same amount of RM and found that the sample with higher superplasticizer content had a long dormant period, emphasizing the need to choose the correct dosage of superplasticizer. The reaction kinetics of adding 10% RM to replace cement (Brazilian type CPIII) in pastes and different types of superplasticizers, namely sulfonated melamine (SM) and sodium polycarboxylate (PC), were studied by Fujii et al. [71] . The heat of hydration was monitored using an isothermal calorimeter. The addition of RM affected the chemical reactions in the curing stage and increased the heat release during the wetting period as the surface area increased on using RM owing to its finer particle size, causing an extension in the induction and acceleration periods. RM was also responsible for the surge in ettringite formation as it contains excess aluminum. However, adding RM led to a delayed induction period due to a large amount of aluminate and silicate ions in the solution. The use of different superplasticizers affected the reaction in different ways. The use of SM considerably delayed the wetting period, whereas PC significantly affected the induction period. The reaction rate was also reduced using PC, which SM did not do. Thus, SM did not significantly impact the heat flow of pastes.  5.9 Environmental performance Putrevu et al. [24]  evaluated the environmental performance of concrete and mortar mixes where RM was used to replace cement and FA. In this paper, the combined mechanical, environmental, and economic performance has been analyzed for the SCC mixes where RM has been used to partially replace FA as per the evaluation method given by Khodabakhshian et al. [72] . The environmental performance is evaluated by calculating three parameters, i.e., global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), and fossil fuel depletion potential (FP). The equations used for the three are as follows:(4) GWP  i  = 0.885 ∗ C i    + 0.0032 ∗ A i    + 0.0025 ∗ W i    + ( 1.11 ∗ SP  i  )      (5) AP  i  = 0.0053 ∗ C i    + 0.00002 ∗ A i    + 0.0045 ∗ W i    + ( 0.00481 ∗ SP  i  )      (6) FP  i  = 1.49 ∗ C i    + 0.0063 ∗ A i    + 0.01 ∗ W i    + ( 83.97 ∗ SP  i  )       In the above equations, C stands for concrete, A for aggregates, W for water content, and SP for superplasticizer. The summation of the three is calculated, and the results are normalized for each research article based on the highest obtained value. This value gives the environmental performance. The mechanical performance is calculated for the mixes by normalizing the 28 days compressive strength for each paper under study. The economic evaluation is based on cost normalization. The cost of each mix is calculated as per the following equation –(7) Cost  i  = 1 ∗ C i    + 0.1 ∗ A i    + 0.0034 ∗ W i    + ( 45 ∗ SP  i  )       It is important to note that all the above equations do not consider RM in the evaluation as it is waste material and does not add any extra environmental effects or cost. The overall score is then calculated by giving equal weightage to all three aspects, and the score is normalized. The overall score of the mixes of some papers has been plotted in Fig. 19  . As per the observations from Fig. 8 , it is known that the mixes containing RM have higher mechanical strength and have greater environmental scores than the control mix (Fig. 18 ), but depending on the amount of superplasticizer that has been used to maintain workability for each of the cases, the overall score degrades. The amount of superplasticizer that needs to be used also depends on the source of RM, as it is a waste material that slightly varies in properties from place to place. Further research can be done to optimize the usage of superplasticizers by using some equivalent alternatives which are economical, maintain workability, and improve the overall score.   6 Discussion In 2015, the United Nations laid down 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. The utilization of RM, which is essentially a waste material, in the construction sector for producing the world’s most consumed construction material, i.e., concrete, contributes to achieving the SDGs. Cement production releases a lot of CO2  gases into the atmosphere, causing global warming. Concrete production accounts for 4 to 8% of the CO2  emissions in the world. Using RM to replace cement reduces the demand for cement, thus helping keep a check on the climate. This helps achieve the 13th SDG, i.e., climate action. Also, fossil fuels are used extensively for cement production, whereas RM, a waste material, is already produced while extracting Alumina and does not require additional energy. This promotes the 12th SDG, i.e., Responsible Consumption and Production. The 9th goal, i.e., industry, innovation, and infrastructure, aims to find lasting solutions to economic and environmental challenges. Using RM in concrete will eventually solve the disposal problems of RM and save both space and energy.  7 Conclusions This review focuses on using RM to replace binders in various cementitious materials, especially concrete mixes. A broad spectrum of properties has been reviewed to understand where and how much content of RM can be used. The use of RM in cementitious materials also provides an alternate disposal method of RM, which is otherwise environmentally degrading and expensive, as discussed before. Some of the aspects covered in the review are as presented –• Adding RM reduces the workability of concrete due to its finer particle size and water absorption capacity. The various tests, such as slump test, setting time, flow table tests, V funnel, J ring, and L box, converge to the same findings. Thus, some quantity of superplasticizer needs to be added on using RM if the construction is of complex shapes and requires high workability.  • Depending on the source of RM, around 10 to 20% of it can be used to replace cement in concrete mixes. RM can accelerate hydration, and the mixes have higher compressive strength than the control mix. Further, RM addition reduces strength. The optimum amount of RM to replace FA content in the mixes has also been reviewed.  • It is observed that the calcinated or sintered RM has better strength properties than the mixes using untreated RM. Tensile strength, flexural strength, and elastic modulus also show a similar trend for all mixes.  • Adding RM has a positive impact on the durability characteristics of concrete. It helped reduce chloride migration, increased resistance to sulphate attack, reduced expansions due to the alkali-silica effect and improved freezing and thawing resistance. This enhancement is possible due to the finer particle size of RM compared to cement, forming a denser structure and arresting cracks.  • Microstructural studies like XRD, SEM, SEM-EDS, and FTIR revealed structure densification by adding RM and forming higher hydrated products, improving strength. However, these results are seen up to a definite replacement level, and then the reverse is observed as incomplete hydration takes place upon adding too much RM.  • The thermal properties and the thermograms have also been summarized. Increasing RM content increases alkalinity, intensifying the formation of ettringite and leads to a rapid increase in the heat released with the gradual increase in RM content. The cumulative heat released was higher for RM samples.  • The environmental score analysis has also been performed for some of the available data considering the impact of three factors, i.e., environment, mechanical strength, and cost. The optimum level of incorporation varies from paper to paper based on the quantity of the raw materials, mainly the superplasticizer used, as it plays a major role in determining cost.    All the studies reviewed here reveal a propitious chance of replacing some proportion of cement with RM. It can be used in various materials such as low-strength concrete and ultra-high-performance concrete and help make the concrete industry more eco-friendly, as concrete is the most widely used construction material. Certain research needs to be done to resolve some of the ambiguous findings, as noted in the review, enhancing the scope of utilizing RM by the construction industry and providing a cleaner production.
