                  Based on UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this study selects 43 indicators from three dimensions to construct an evaluation index system for sustainable land use (SLU). Thirty provincial administrative regions in China from 2002 to 2018 are chosen to comprise the study area. Real-coded accelerating genetic algorithm–projection pursuit techniques and an exploratory spatial data analysis model are used to study the spatiotemporal differences in the SLU levels of the provinces in China. Results show the following: (1) During the study period, the SLU level in China demonstrated an overall upward trend of fluctuations, along with obvious regional differences. (2) The spatial pattern of the SLU level in China was high in the eastern region and low in the western region in the east–west direction; for the north–south direction, an inverted U-shaped distribution was noted. (3) The main types of local spatial autocorrelation are H–H and L–L types, and both have evident spatial clustering characteristics. (4) The realization of Goal A is the main driving force for the improvement of the SLU level, whereas the failure to realize Goals B and C effectively is the main bottleneck in the improvement of the SLU level.

Yutao Wang Based on UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this study selects 43 indicators from three dimensions to construct an evaluation index system for sustainable land use (SLU). Thirty provincial administrative regions in China from 2002 to 2018 are chosen to comprise the study area. Real-coded accelerating genetic algorithm–projection pursuit techniques and an exploratory spatial data analysis model are used to study the spatiotemporal differences in the SLU levels of the provinces in China. Results show the following: (1) During the study period, the SLU level in China demonstrated an overall upward trend of fluctuations, along with obvious regional differences. (2) The spatial pattern of the SLU level in China was high in the eastern region and low in the western region in the east–west direction; for the north–south direction, an inverted U-shaped distribution was noted. (3) The main types of local spatial autocorrelation are H–H and L–L types, and both have evident spatial clustering characteristics. (4) The realization of Goal A is the main driving force for the improvement of the SLU level, whereas the failure to realize Goals B and C effectively is the main bottleneck in the improvement of the SLU level.

The contradiction between man and land has become increasingly prominent, and sustainable land use (SLU) has gradually become a research hotspot for scholars (Xie et al., 2020b ). With the rise of sustainable development research, various disciplines have begun to propose definitions of sustainability that suit their respective research fields. In 1993, FAO defined SLU as the way in which land use favors the maintenance and productivity increase of the land, reduces the risks that may be caused by the use of land resources and stabilizes land output, protects the potential of natural resources and prevents soil degradation, promotes social and economic growth and increases the welfare level of the people, and achieves social acceptability (FAO, 1993 ). Ensuring SLU is one of the important ways to achieve regional sustainable development. Therefore, in view of regional resource endowment and land use characteristics, a reasonable SLU evaluation index system should be established in accordance with local conditions to determine the sustainability of regional land use quantitatively. The results can provide a scientific basis for formulating strategies, policies, and countermeasures for SLU (Lu and Ke, 2018 ) and offer important theoretical and practical significance. The quantitative evaluation of SLU has become the core content of SLU research. At present, scholars mainly focus on the construction of an evaluation index system framework and the selection of evaluation methods. Thus far, scholars have not reached a consensus on the construction of such an evaluation index system (Chan et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2009 ). Moreover, at different stages of social and economic development, the goals, models, scales, and benefits of land use in different regions differ, and the factors affecting SLU levels vary. Hence, using the same evaluation index system to measure the SLU status in different regions is not advisable. In actual applications, scholars often make corresponding adjustments according to the study areas and the availability of data. At present, developing countries (e.g., China) are facing problems, such as decrease in cultivated land, serious shortage of land reserve resources, worsening land pollution, and the decline of land quality in the process of rapid industrialization and urbanization, that is, the unsustainable use of the quantity and quality of land (Zhang et al. , Li et al., 2020 ). Developed countries, such as the United States, Germany, and Japan, have also encountered the problem of unsustainable land use during their industrialization and urbanization (Cheung et al., 2021 ; Alarima et al., 2020 ; Walmsley et al., 2020 ). Scholars from different countries have explored the governance and protection of land resources. This topic has important reference and guiding significance for regional SLU and ecological environment protection. For example, Karna (2020)  believed that soil nutrient balance in developing countries has an increasingly important role in soil fertility management and sustainable agricultural development. Therefore, Karna (2020)  used Nepal as the research area and applied the seemingly unrelated regression model to explore the effects of various socioeconomic factors on three macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). The results of the study showed that male-headed households, a reasonable family size, and the use of improved manure composting methods have a positive effect on the soil nutrient balance and SLU in the region. Theissen (2019)  believed that changes in land use caused by political or socioeconomic transformation in the Kazbegi region in the central Greater Caucasus of Georgia result in the deterioration of the ecological landscape and the marginalization of the population. In view of this, Theissen (2019)  used the normative scenario approach to achieve a considerable increase in biomass production, livestock production, and related income within the region. The study also proposed that the combination of optimized livestock production and ecological restrictions can effectively maintain the functions of the mountain ecosystem to achieve the sustainable development of mountainous land. Begum (2019)  believed that weeds pose a serious threat to the crop productivity of South Asian countries. As a secondary metabolite produced and released by plant species, allelopathy can affect the growth and development of other species. In addition, species with potential for plant growth inhibition may replace herbicides on agricultural land and play an increasingly important role in sustainable weed management. To prevent and control land degradation and pollution, scholars in various countries have adopted corresponding land resource protection practices in accordance with different topographical characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, and the status quo of land use. SLU in modern China should continuously learn from the concepts of various regions and countries and integrate and develop these concepts with land use system and practice in China to realize regional sustainable land development. Sustainable development is currently a hot topic that has attracted global concern. With the continuous exploration of the coordination of economy, society, and environment, sustainable development has become a strategic guide for the development of various countries in different fields (Halisçelik and Soytas, 2019 ). The 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Summit released Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . The agenda included political declarations, 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 specific goals, implementation means, and follow-up actions, providing universal goals for countries to formulate sustainable development strategies. Since the promulgation of this agenda, China has attached great importance to the implementation of the 17 SDGs. Subsequently, China released “China's National Plan on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” and “China's Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” These two programs deeply integrate the SDGs with China's national conditions and formulate local-level response strategies and policies. They also serve as a reference for other developing countries to promote the implementation of SDGs (Xue et al., 2018 ). In the process of land use, the goal that the land unit needs to achieve is that various land use activities do not exceed the self-renewal ability of the natural land system (Hu et al., 2019 ; Holtslag-Broekhof, 2017 ). Moreover, the production and renewal capacity of the natural land system must be continuously protected and strengthened (Wu et al., 2017 ; Kilic et al., 2019 ). The goal of land use methods is to achieve reasonable and efficient land use (You et al., 2020 ). That is, through spatial planning and land use technology, land resources can achieve the best land use type and spatial combination to protect land resources from damage, obtain the best comprehensive economic, social, and ecological benefits, and maintain the long-term stability of this benefit (Giuliani et al., 2020 ). For human beings (land users, beneficiaries, and operators), the goal is to meet the needs of contemporary generations for the quantity and quality of land without exceeding the carrying capacity of the natural land system and without posing a threat to the survival and development of future generations (Huaranca et al., 2019 ; Hashimoto et al., 2018 ). Hence, the goals of land use are consistent with the SDGs, and the process of land use profoundly affects the realization of SDGs. That is to achieve economic development, a beautiful environment and social tolerance. However, since the promulgation of the SDGs, only a few studies have explored the evaluation of SLU levels and the formulation of corresponding sustainable development strategies on the basis of the SDG framework. Numerous methods can be used to evaluate SLU. Conventional methods, such as the analytic hierarchy process (Peng et al., 2006 ), the entropy method (Ji et al., 2020 ), and data envelopment analysis (Lu et al., 2017 ), are mainly used to evaluate SLU levels quantitatively. These methods can then be utilized to analyze the dynamic change law, spatial differentiation characteristics, time series changes, or driving force of SLU. However, these research methods often suffer from problems, such as the subjective setting of index weights and the difficulty of dealing with high-dimensional data. Therefore, using them to characterize objectively the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and non-normal characteristics of various indicators in SLU evaluation is difficult. To overcome this shortcoming, the academic community has proposed exploratory data analysis methods that are directly driven by sample data. One such method is called projection pursuit (PP). Relative to traditional evaluation methods, PP techniques have unique advantages in the processing of high-dimensional data and are not restricted by the limitations of formalization and mathematics. PP techniques have been widely used in the comprehensive evaluation of energy (Wang and Yang, 2020 ), urbanization (Huang et al., 2020 ), and disaster risk (Wu and Wang, 2020 ). Scholars have applied PP models to regional land use (intensive use of cultivated land, intensive use of transportation land, evaluation of land carrying capacity, land ecological security, and comprehensive benefits of land remediation) spatial distribution, and dynamic evaluation from different angles. For example, Deng (2013)  used the genetic algorithm–PP model for a quantitative and comprehensive evaluation of the time series changes and spatial differentiation of the intensive use of cultivated land in the Changzhutan urban agglomeration from 1996 to 2009. The results of the study showed that the intensive use of cultivated land in the Changzhutan urban agglomeration demonstrates a phased development trend and exhibits characteristics of spatial differentiation. Compared with conventional methods, the PP method is more objective and reliable and has richer information representation and more reasonable results. Moreover, it is effective in the evaluation of the intensive use of cultivated land. Gao (2011)  proposed a genetic algorithm–PP model for the comprehensive evaluation of the intensive use of transportation land, aiming at the incompatibility between multiple targets and indicators of the evaluation system for intensive use of transportation land. The results showed that the PP model based on accelerated genetic algorithm can simply, accurately, objectively, and intuitively solve the nonlinear and non-normal problems in the evaluation of intensive use of land. It is a highly potential land intensive use evaluation method. The empirical research showed that using this method for modeling and evaluation makes decision-making easy; moreover, it is objective, practical, and maneuverable. As the SLU evaluation system shares similarities with the above research systems, PP techniques are theoretically suitable for SLU evaluation. In addition, the construction and optimization of PP techniques are key factors for the effective use of these techniques. The PP model is a complex nonlinear optimization problem with the projection index function as the objective function and the projection direction of each index as the optimization variable, which is difficult to solve with traditional optimization methods. The real-coded accelerating genetic algorithm (RAGA) can effectively solve complex multiobjective function optimization problems (Fu et al., 2003 ; Touat et al., 2014 ). Therefore, combining it with the PP model is theoretically suitable for SLU evaluation. At present, existing SLU evaluation research has the following shortcomings: On the one hand, research on the evaluation index system of SLU based on the old criteria can no longer meet the new needs of regional sustainable development. For example, the coordinated development of urban and rural areas, poverty eradication, and the construction of safe cities have received increasing attention from various countries. On the other hand, the existing studies are mostly based on the traditional analysis framework in the construction of the index system, and lack of innovation in the theoretical analysis framework. In addition, given the complexity of the SDG framework, many indicators have yet to determine scientifically unified quantification and evaluation standards. Moreover, the indicator design does not consider the differences in national development stages and data acquisition capabilities, leading to many obstacles in the implementation of SDGs in different countries. Thus, a scientific, reasonable, and innovative evaluation index system for SLU must be established urgently on the basis of goal orientation and reality. Based on the above discussion, this study localizes relevant goals and specific goals under the SDG framework to build an SLU evaluation index system that meets the requirements of China's future sustainable development. The research results can not only improve the theoretical methods of SLU but also provide path support for realizing SLU and a basis for the introduction of relevant policies on land use. In addition, we use a PP model based on accelerated genetic algorithms to project high-dimensional data of SLU onto a one-dimensional subspace and find projection values that can accurately reflect the structure or characteristics of high-dimensional data. In this manner, the level of SLU in different provinces can be intuitively studied and analyzed. Furthermore, this study introduces the exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) method to measure the level of SLU between provinces in China and identify the spatial differences of regional differences; explore the spatial distribution pattern, spatial correlation, and evolution pattern of the spatial agglomeration state of the SLU level; and show its spatial–temporal differentiation through visual methods, such as Sankey chart and trend surface analysis. This work has important theoretical and practical significance as it compensates for the lack of existing research by optimizing the structure of SLU in the region and promoting the efficient allocation of land resources. Therefore, the current work takes the provinces of China as the basic evaluation unit while considering the actual situation of each province and the existing research to regionalize the relevant targets under the SDG framework. The goal is to build an SLU evaluation index system that meets the requirements of future sustainable development in China. Specifically, RAGA–PP techniques and an ESDA model are introduced to measure quantitatively and identify spatially the level of SLU in China from 2002 to 2018 and thereby provide a decision-making basis for sustainable land management in China.  2 Construction of an SLU index system in China for SDGs SLU in China is a complex systematic process involving economy, society, environment, politics, culture, and many other factors. It is characterized as nonlinear and dynamic. At the same time, different provinces in China have different development modes, economic conditions, and scale characteristics. Therefore, China's SLU indicators for SDGs need to be classified and screened locally. At present, most evaluation index systems for SLU are only applicable to specific research areas or research objects, and the versatility is poor (Nguyen et al., 2015 ; Ristic et al., 2018 ). A few scholars have studied the universal evaluation index system for SLU in different provinces. Therefore, how to establish a universal evaluation index system applicable to all types of land has become an important bottleneck for the scientific evaluation of the SLU level. On this basis, the selection of evaluation indicators in this study needs to follow the principles of scientificity, versatility, practicability, and easy data access. The selected indicators should objectively reflect the SLU status of each province and simultaneously put aside geographical restrictions (such as social economy, natural environment, and policy system) so that the selected indicators can be used in all provinces in China. The selection of the evaluation indicators for SLU in this study follows the following principles: (1) Independence. The evaluation indicators are independent of each other at the same level, without duplication or overlap. (2) Comprehensiveness. From the perspective of internal value and external conditions, it can fully reflect all aspects of SLU, covering a wide range and strong system. (3) Scientificity. On the basis of scientific evidence and credible research results, scientific methods are used to screen evaluation indicators that can reflect the true state of SLU. (4) Operationality. The indicators should be as simple and clear as possible and easy to collect and process for comparison and evaluation. The indicators directly in line with China's statistical system should be retained. If the specific targets are the same but the indicators are different from as those in China's existing yearbooks, then replacement and revision are needed. This study argues that the goals related to SLU among the 17 SDGs include goals 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 11, which cover all land use types (Zhang, 2019 ). From the three perspectives of “economic development,” “beautiful environment,” and “social inclusion,” this study constructs an SLU evaluation index system with “efficient and intensive land use,” “protection and improvement of the ecological environment of the land,” and “acceptance by society” as the three dimensions (Fig. 1  , Table 1  , and Table 2  ). Specifically, Goal 2 mainly corresponds to agricultural land. By 2030, agricultural productivity and income are proposed to be doubled, and farmers would need equal access to land and other resource elements and nonagricultural employment opportunities. Furthermore, the productivity and yield of the land must be increased, and the soil and land quality must be gradually improved. Goal 9 mainly corresponds to industrial land. By 2030, the proportion of industrial output value in GDP should be greatly increased. Moreover, industrial land infrastructure must be upgraded and transformed, resource utilization efficiency must be improved, clean and environmentally friendly technologies must be adopted, and industrial processes must be optimized to improve the industry in terms of its sustainability and industrial land use efficiency. Goal 9 mainly corresponds to urban land. By 2030, a sustainable transportation system must be established, road safety must be improved, and the public transportation network must be expanded. In addition, inclusive and sustainable urban construction and management in China must be strengthened, all residents must be provided with green, barrier-free, safe, and inclusive public spaces, and the realization of the harmonious symbiosis and sustainable development of urban and rural areas must be accelerated to achieve urban–rural integration development. These three goals are mainly to propose future goals from the aspects of land resource and utilization, land use status, land use efficiency, and land benefits (Bryan et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be summarized as “efficient and intensive land use.” For different land use types, the subgoals can be set as follows: “improve agricultural land production capacity,” “promote the intensive use and transformation of industrial land,” and “build safe and inclusive cities.” Goal 2 proposes that by 2030, the number of deaths and illnesses caused by soil pollution is drastically reduced. The reason is that soil pollution caused by industrial and agricultural wastewater and solid waste has seriously threatened human health and safety. Therefore, the restoration and prevention of soil pollution is urgent. Goal 15 proposes to restore degraded land and soil (including land desertification, land salinization, and land affected by floods and droughts) through measures, such as land use engineering, soil reconstruction, vegetation reconstruction, land consolidation, and ecological restoration by 2030, and thus build a world where land degradation no longer occurs. These two goals are mainly from the perspective of long-term maintenance of land production capacity by improving land quality, controlling soil pollution, preventing land desertification, and preventing land degradation to maintain the land ecosystem in a healthy and balanced state. These two goals can be summarized as “protect and improve the ecological environment of the land,” From the perspective of land use, the subgoals can be set as follows: “prevent land pollution” and “restore the land ecosystem and prevent land degradation.” Goal 1 proposes to eradicate poverty worldwide. Land is an important capital element for productive activities, and its rational use can effectively promote regional economic development and increase the income of residents (urban and rural residents). This goal starts from the perspective of the socioeconomic effect of land use, thereby ensuring that land use is socially acceptable. Therefore, the goal can be summarized as “eradication of poverty,” and the subgoal can be set as “accepted by society.”  3 Materials and methods 3.1 Study area To analyze the differences in the level of SLU in China from multiple perspectives, the 30 provinces in China are divided into the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions. Each region has unique socioeconomic characteristics and land resource conditions. Therefore, the SLU level in different regions is not balanced. The eastern region includes three municipalities directly under the Central Government (Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai) and seven provinces (Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan), basically covering the eastern coast of China. Given inherent geographical advantages, resource advantages and economic foundation, and priority to benefit from the central preferential policies, this region has accumulated abundant human and material resources for its later development. Therefore, the eastern region not only is a pioneer in urbanization and economic development in China but also has the most developed economy and industrial structure in China (Wu et al., 2019 ). In the economically developed eastern regions, the social and economic benefits of cultivated land production are often too low, resulting in low cultivated land use efficiency. The main manifestations are the decrease in the multiple cropping index of cultivated land and the increase in the abandoned area (Liu et al., 2019 ). In addition, urban land in the eastern region is characterized by rapid expansion, shortage of land resources, and high levels of intensive use (Li et al., 2015 ). The central region includes six provinces (Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, and Hunan). Since the implementation of the Central Region Rise Strategy in 2006, the central region has gradually recovered from the collapse of the central region, the quality of economic operation has been continuously improved, and the overall strength has been further enhanced, playing an irreplaceable role in the national economy (Zhang et al., 2018 ). The central region is rich in land resources and is an important food security base in China, with outstanding advantages in food production. However, the environmental and ecological situation in the central region is severe, and it is facing a series of outstanding problems, such as extensive economic growth pattern, low land use efficiency, strained relationship between man and land, increased urban environmental pollution, increased agricultural nonpoint source pollution, ecosystem degradation, and low quality of urbanization and pressure of economic transformation (Fu et al., 2017 ; Huang et al., 2014 ). The western region includes 11 provinces (Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang). The western region is the most impoverished region in China, facing many challenges, such as deterioration of the ecological environment, shortage of land resources, and lagging social and economic development (Zhang et al., 2017 ). The economic and social development gap between the western region and other regions has been increasing continuously over the past 40 years of reform and opening up because of China's macro development strategy and the natural geographical location of the western region. In addition, under the background that the western development strategy follows point-axis development theory, the regional economic differences and polarization of many western provinces have also shown an expanding trend (Jia et al., 2020 ). The western region is the main ecological service supply area in China, and it is also the region with the most fragile land ecosystem, the most obvious regional differentiation, and the most complex climate conditions in China (Lv et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, land resources in the western region are characterized by low degree of intensification, serious soil erosion, obvious salinization, and poor geological conditions. The northeastern region includes three provinces (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning). As an old industrial base in China, northeastern China has a good industrial foundation. However, industrial growth in the northeastern region has stagnated, and the overall economic vitality has declined due to the adjustment of the national industrial layout and opening-up strategy. In view of this, the provinces in the northeastern region have taken active measures to promote the revitalization of the old industrial base (Ren et al., 2020 ; Guo et al., 2020 ). The implementation of strategies, such as the transformation of shanty towns, resource-based cities, and port economic belt, has promoted the economic development of the northeastern region to a certain extent. However, regional economic differences are still the main factor restricting the sustainable development and overall revitalization of the northeastern region. The northeastern region has become the main area of commercial grain production and transportation and is reserved with the best agricultural resource endowment and the greatest potential for grain production in China. The region also has the largest corn, high-quality japonica rice, and soybean production area in China, and its grain production capacity directly affects national food security (Li et al., 2017 , 2020 ). The socioeconomic characteristics and land resource endowments of different regions in China considerably differ between regions and within provinces. Such difference has a considerable effect on the formation of regional differences in the SLU level. Therefore, evaluating the spatial difference of SLU levels in different regions of China is appropriate and feasible (see Fig. 2  ).  3.2 Research framework This study is based on the ideas of “Identification of Issues-Index System Construction-Empirical Analysis-Research Conclusions.” First, on the basis of the SDG framework, a comprehensive evaluation index system for the SLU is constructed. Second, by using data from various provinces in China, a PP model based on accelerated genetic algorithms is used to evaluate SLU. This model can obtain the ranking of the SLU level in each province, and the best projection direction can reflect the difference in the contribution degree of each evaluation index to the SLU level (Table A1 ). Lastly, ESDA, trend surface analysis, and spatiotemporal transition methods are used to analyze the spatial–temporal differences of SLU levels. The specific process is shown in Fig. 4   .  3.3 Methods 3.3.1 Real-coded accelerating genetic Algorithm–Projection pursuit (1) Projection Pursuit Model    The PP model is an emerging statistical method that deals with multifactor, nonlinear, and high-dimensional data. The basic idea is to project high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional space and optimize the projection objective function by setting constraints to find a projection direction vector that can reflect the characteristics of the high-dimensional data structure. Then, the characteristics of the high-dimensional data are studied on the basis of the scattering structure of the low-dimensional projection data (Espezua et al., 2015 ; Liu et al., 2019 ). The specific establishment process of the PP model is as follows: Step 1  Normalization of the evaluation sample index set. With 30 provinces in China taken as the research object, the initial sample set of each index is constructed: { X ∗ ( i ,  j )  | i = 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  … ,  n ;  j = 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  … ,  p }   , where X ∗ ( i ,  j )     is the j   -th evaluation index value of the i   -th sample province, and n   , p    are the number of sample provinces and the number of evaluation indicators, respectively. The collected data are normalized by the following formula to eliminate the influence of dimensions on the overall evaluation results: For benefit indicators (the bigger, the better),(1) X ( i , j )  = X ( i ， j )  − X m i n   ( j )   X m a x   ( j )  − X m i n   ( j )         For cost indicators (the smaller, the better),(2) X ( i , j )  = X m a x   ( j )  − X ( i , j )   X m a x   ( j )  − X m i n   ( j )        where X m i n   ( j )     and X m a x   ( j )     are the minimum and maximum values of the j   -th evaluation index, respectively; X ( i , j )     is the normalized processing result of the evaluation index value. Step 2  Construction of the PP function. The PP model can integrate p   -dimensional data { X ( i ,  j )  | i = 1 ,  2 ,  3 , … ,  n ;  j = 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  … ,  p }    into one-dimensional projection value a = { a ( 1 )  ， a ( 2 )  ， … ， a ( p )  }     with Z ( i )     as the best projection direction.(3) Z ( i )  = ∑  j = 1  p  a ( j )  · X ( i , j  )  ,  i  =  1 ,  2 ,  … ,  n ,     where a    is a unit length vector. The expression of the PP function Q ( a )     is(4) Q ( a )  = S z  • D z  ,     where S z     and D z     are the standard deviation and local density of the projection value Z ( i )    , respectively; the calculation formulas are as follows:(5) S z  = ∑  i = 1  n  [ z ( i )  − E ( z )  ]  2   n − 1     ,     (6) D z  = ∑  i = 1  n  ∑  j = 1  n  [ R − r ( i , j )  ]  • u [ R − r ( i , j  )   ]  ,     where E ( z )     is the average value of the projection value Z ( i )    , and R    is the window radius of the local density. For the value of R , the number of projection points in the window should not be too small to avoid excessive moving average deviation; it can be determined in accordance with multiple experiments. r ( i , j  )     represents the distance between samples, and u ( R − r ( i , j  )   )    is the unit step function. When R ≤ r ( i , j  )    , the function value is 0; when R ≥ r ( i , j  )    , the function value is 1. Step 3  Optimization of the PP function. For a certain sample index set, the change of the projection direction a    causes the PP function Q ( a )     to change. When the PP function takes the maximum value, the corresponding vector reflects the best projection direction, that is, the projection direction that exposes the characteristics of the multidimensional data structure with the greatest probability. The optimal projection direction can be estimated by solving the nonlinear optimal problem.(7) M a x Q ( a )  = S z  • D z      (8) s . t .  ∑  j = 1  p  a 2  ( j )  = 1 ,  a ∈ [ 0 ， 1 ]       Step 4  Comprehensive evaluation analysis. By substituting the best projection vector a ∗     obtained in Step 3  into Equation (3) , the projection value Z ∗  ( i )     of each sample province can be obtained. Then, the SLU level of 30 provinces in China can be determined.(2) Real-coded Accelerating Genetic Algorithm    The solution of the optimal projection direction is a complex nonlinear optimization problem. Many mature algorithms can be used to solve nonlinear optimization problems. They include particle swarm optimization (Cai et al., 2019 ), immune clone algorithm (Chen et al., 2019 ), gray wolf optimization (Tripathi et al., 2018 ), and gravitational search algorithm (García-Ródenas et al., 2019 ). However, these algorithms generally have several problems; for example, they have premature convergence and slow operation speed, and they easily fall into the local optimum. Hence, this study chooses a relatively mature genetic algorithm as the basic algorithm for solving the best projection direction. The genetic algorithm is a global optimization search algorithm that simulates the natural selection and chromosome exchange mechanism of Darwin's biological evolution theory. The standard genetic algorithm (SGA) based on natural selection and natural gene mechanism is a strong and widely used versatility optimization algorithm. However, the SGA has several drawbacks, including poor adaptability to changes in the size of the optimization variable search space, large calculation amount, and premature convergence in actual use. Aiming at these shortcomings, Jin (2001)  used the outstanding individuals found in the operation of the traditional genetic algorithm and then gradually adjusted the search range of optimized variables; a RAGA is then formed. The RAGA mainly improves the SGA from three aspects. First, real number coding is used. In this manner, the individual code length can be equal to the number of decision variables. Therefore, the true value of the decision variable is used. Second, the RAGA helps improve the optimization efficiency of SGA. The RAGA regards the excellent individual change interval generated by the previous two evolutionary iterations as the new change interval in the next iteration so that the change interval of variables and the distance to the best point are gradually reduced. These characteristics not only ensure the convergence of the algorithm but also speed up the optimization speed. Lastly, the RAGA obtains three offspring groups of selection, cross, and mutation on the basis of parent groups. This feature avoids the mutual convergence of the population to a certain extent and maintains the diversity of the population. In this study, the initial population size of the parent is set to N  =  400   , the crossover probability is ρ =  0.80   , the mutation probability is ρ m  =  0.80   , the number of outstanding individuals is selected as n = 15   , a = 0.05   , and the number of accelerations is 30. The flowchart of the RAGA is shown in Fig. 3 .  3.3.2 Exploratory spatial data analysis ESDA is a method for revealing the spatial heterogeneity, spatial dependence, and spatial autocorrelation between variables, and it has been widely used in different fields (Ye and Wu, 2011 ; Dou et al., 2016 ). The first law of geography believes in a certain degree of interconnection between things, and the degree of interconnection gradually increases as the distance decreases. Therefore, this study adopts Moran's I index, which is the mainstream of spatial statistics, to measure the spatial correlation of the SLU levels of 30 provinces in China. Moran's I index can be divided into the global Moran's I index and the local Moran's I index. The former can be used to explore the spatial agglomeration or dispersion of the sample as a whole, whereas the latter can be used to investigate the agglomeration and discrete distribution characteristics of local areas. The calculation formulas of the two are as follows:(9) I = ∑  i = 1  n  ∑  j = 1  n  ω i j   ( x i  − x ‾  )  ( x j  − x ‾  )    S 2  ∑  i = 1  n  ∑  j = 1  n  ω i j         (10) I i  = ( x i  − x ‾  )  ∑  j = 1  n  ω i j   ( x j  − x ‾  )    S 2        In the formula, x i     and x j     represent the geographical attribute observation values of regions i    and j   , respectively. x ‾     is the average number of observations; n    represents the number of sample cities; S 2     is the sample variance; ω i j      is the geographical distance spatial weight matrix, ω i j   = 1 / d i j   2    ; d i j      represents the Euclidean distance of the geographic space centroid of the two cities; I    is the global Moran's I index, and its value range is [ − 1 ,  1 ]   . If I > 0   , then a positive spatial correlation effect exists. If I < 0   , then a negative spatial correlation effect exists. If I = 0   , then no spatial autocorrelation effect exists, that is, the attribute data are randomly distributed in space. I i     is the local Moran's I index, which can reflect the degree of similarity between the observations in the local area and the observations in the surrounding adjacent areas. If I i  > 0   , then the similar values of similar attributes of neighboring elements in the local area are spatially clustered. If I i  < 0   , then the dissimilar values of different attributes of neighboring features in the local area present a spatial aggregation. If I i  = 0   , then the neighboring element values of the local area are randomly distributed in space. In accordance with the local Moran's I index, local spatial agglomeration can be divided into four types: high–high (H–H), low–high (L–H), high–low (H–L), and low–low (L–L).  3.3.3 Trend surface analysis Trend surface analysis is the use of spatial data to fit a spatial curved surface to illustrate the spatial change trend and distribution law of geographical element observations with a large spatial span. It is a smooth mathematical surface and an approximation of the actual surface, that is, actual surface = trend surface + remaining surface. The trend surface reflects the regional change law, which is controlled by a wide range of systemic factors. The remaining surface reflects the characteristics of local changes, which are controlled by local and random factors. Let the actual observation data of geographic elements be z i  ( x i  , y i   )  ( i = 1,2 ⋯ , n )     and the fitted value of the trend surface be z ˆ  i  ( x i  , y i   )    . Then,(11) z i  ( x i  , y i   )  = z ˆ  i  ( x i  , y i   )  + ε i      where x i    , y i     are the plane space coordinates; ε i     is the residual value (residual error). Common fitting forms are first-order (linear), second-order (quadratic), and third-order (cubic) polynomials. This study uses a second-order polynomial to fit the spatial trend surface of SLU.   3.4 Data sources The basic data of the measure of SLU level originate from the “China Statistical Yearbook (2003–2019),” “China Rural Statistical Yearbook (2003–2019),”  and “China City Statistical Yearbook (2003–2019).”    4 Results and analysis 4.1 Analysis of regional differences of SLU levels This study uses the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions to classify the Chinese region. From an overall perspective, the current level of SLU in China is generally rising, but the overall level is not high. Obvious regional differences exist in the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions. During the study period, the levels of SLU in the eastern and western regions fluctuated slightly, and no significant increase or decrease overall was observed. Contrary to the SLU levels in the eastern and western regions, those in the northeastern and central regions fluctuated greatly, with the average values fluctuating in the ranges of 2.31–2.60 and 2.09–2.58, respectively. Only the SLU level in the eastern region was much higher than the average level, and the SLU levels of the other three regions were relatively close and below the average level. The SLU level in the eastern region was almost twice those of the other regions (Fig. 5  ). This difference was caused by the rapid transformation of the industrial structure in the eastern region and its stronger technological innovation capability in comparison with that of other regions. The upgrading of the industrial structure can eliminate high-pollution and energy-intensive enterprises and thus provide low-energy, low-pollution industries with room for development. From this point of view, technological innovation and development can effectively promote the improvement of SLU levels. In addition, because of the differences in the degree of economic development, the proportions of human and financial resources allocated for agricultural technological innovation in the eastern region and in other regions vary. Hence, the efficiency of agricultural technology innovation in the eastern region is significantly higher than that in other regions. This condition is highly conducive to the sustainable and intensive use of agricultural land. Moreover, the SLU level in the northeastern region is higher than that in the central and western regions because of the abundant land use types in the northeastern region. Forest, farmland, and grassland ecosystems are the main types of ecosystems. Among them, the land cover types are mainly cultivated land and forest land. Compared with the central and western regions, this has a higher vegetation coverage, which shows strong soil conservation, water conservation, and wind and sand fixation capabilities. In addition, the northeastern region is an important food base and ecological function zone in China. Therefore, the Chinese government has formulated a series of agricultural development support policies and ecological environmental protection policies for the northeastern region on the basis of changes in the country's overall needs and adjustments to regional functions. And through various forms such as land and ecological engineering drive, space development and guidance, and improvement of regional production and development conditions, the optimal allocation of land resources has been realized, thereby promoting the SLU level in the Northeastern region. The central region is a concentrated area of resource-based cities in China. Resource-based cities are characterized by a resource-dependent economic development model. The huge driving effect of urbanization development usually comes from resource-based industries, the simplification of urban economic development structure, insufficient service functions, insufficient construction of public facilities, and other urban land use problems. Corresponding to it is a serious land ecological security problem (Liu et al., 2020 ; Li et al., 2020 ). Moreover, the National Development and Reform Commission of China has positioned the central region as a key area for new urbanization. The central region is gradually becoming a key region for the transfer of industries and the flow of resource elements in the eastern region. In the context of the accelerated development of social economy and urbanization, the scale of urban land use has expanded, and the adjustment of the land use structure between cities has become more frequent. However, unreasonable urban expansion has brought corresponding land problems. A large amount of cultivated land, grassland, and woodland has been invaded, and the land used for construction and roads has increased sharply, adversely affecting the land ecological environment (Zheng et al., 2017 ; Lu et al., 2014 ). Thus, the effective improvement of SLU in the central region is inhibited. In general, the SLU levels in China and the four regions increased to varying degrees from 2002 to 2018, thereby indicating that sustainable land management policies in China have achieved initial results.  4.2 Spatial trend surface analysis of SLU levels in China This study uses the SLU levels of four time sections, i.e., 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018, as the years of investigation and the Geostatistical Analyst module of ArcGis 10.1 to generate trend surface analysis maps for 30 provinces in China. In Fig. 6  , the X-axis is the east–west direction, the Y-axis is the north–south direction, and the Z-axis represents the SLU level. In general, the level of SLU has not improved significantly. The reason is that the main reasons restricting the improvement of the SLU level in various provinces are the stability of production and the degree of social harmony. The land pollution caused by the large-scale use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the relatively insufficient resource endowment due to numerous people and a small amount of land, and the low level of social and economic development have become bottlenecks restricting the improvement of SLU level. Although various provinces in China are accelerating their economic development and protecting the ecological environment, they have also taken measures, such as comprehensive land consolidation and improvement of land use efficiency, to improve their SLU level. However, the overall situation remains unsustainable, and the SLU level needs to be further improved. Next, the central government not only develops the economy and improve people's livelihood but also protects cultivated land, increases food production, promotes conservation and improve efficiency. Pesticides and fertilizers should be reduced, the level of greening should be increased, and the ecological environment of the land should be improved to promote the coordinated development of the relationship between man and land. In the west–east direction, the spatial evolution trend of SLU level evolves from U-shaped to oblique line-shaped. This condition shows that the gap between the eastern and western regions has increased significantly and that the gap between the central and eastern regions has become significantly narrow. The reasons behind these changes are as follows: First, land use in the western region is significantly affected by topographical factors, coupled with factors, such as fragile ecology, complex environment, and difficulty in the development and utilization of land resources. Moreover, the SLU level is generally low. From the perspective of national strategy, the central region now assumes great responsibility for ensuring food security. The central region is an important area for agricultural development in China. The rapid nonagricultural construction in the eastern region has led to a sharp decline in China's cultivated land, and the contradiction between food supply and demand is prominent and may affect the social stability of the country. Therefore, while advancing industrialization, the central region needs to assume responsibility for agricultural development and vigorously promote agricultural modernization. In the current process of rapid urbanization in the central region, the intensity of agricultural land use remains relatively stable. In addition, agricultural subsidy policies, agricultural technology innovation resources, and agricultural technicians have gradually shifted to the central region. This change can improve the SLU level in the central region to a certain extent. In the south–north direction, the spatial evolution trend of the SLU level has evolved from being straight-shaped to being inverted U-shaped, and the SLU level in the north is better than that in the south. At present, in response to land ecological and environmental problems in the northern region, the Chinese government implements an ecological environment conservation policy centered on returning farmland to forests and sand source control projects. These policies have encouraged local farmers to convert substantial farmland through central fiscal transfer payments, curbed the reclamation of grasslands and sandy land, promoted the restoration of grasslands and forests, and realized the transformation of state-owned forest farms from logging to forest conservation (Liu et al., 2020 ). In pastoral areas, several fence constructions have stabilized the property rights of herders and aroused herders' enthusiasm for protecting grassland. Within a certain period, the grassland carrying capacity was stabilized, and the increase in grassland overloading was curbed. The government has also implemented a series of emergency policies, such as grazing prohibition, spring rest grazing, and slaughter subsidies. The above policies and administrative measures have reduced the frequency of sandstorms from dozens of times a year to several times a year, desertification has been effectively controlled, and vegetation in some areas has been significantly restored (Liu et al., 2017 ; Xu et al., 2010 ). Therefore, the land ecological management in northern China has initially realized the coordinated development of ecological conservation and social economy and improved the SLU level. The reason is that when the economic level of the southern region has developed to a certain level, the dense gathering of enterprises in the same industry forms a crowding effect, which leads to the weakening of the original positive externality. In addition, the difficulty of technological innovation, the shortage of public resources, and environmental pollution problems cause negative externalities to specialization agglomeration, thereby inhibiting the improvement of SLU levels. The newly increased soil erosion control area in the northern region is larger than that in the southern region. In 2008, the State Council of China issued the “National Ecological Fragile Area Protection Program,” which classified the southern red soil hilly areas in Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces as ecologically vulnerable areas. In these areas, under the pressure of the cultivated land requisition–compensation balance policy, the phenomenon of hilly land reclamation is common. However, given the inability to use agricultural machinery and the continuous increase in farming costs, the abandonment of slope cultivated land could easily increase. This condition in turn causes low vegetation coverage, severe surface water erosion, and weakened ecosystem functions, which all lead to urgent land ecological restoration problems (He et al., 2020 ). In addition, red soil is mainly distributed in southern China. At present, China has made great achievements in the reclamation and utilization of red soil resources, which have played an important role in the sustainable development of agriculture, the entire national economy, and the improvement of living standards in China. However, given the physical and chemical properties of red soil, such as acidity, thinness, and stickiness, the red soil distribution area has large topography, uneven distribution of precipitation in time and space, and land degradation problems, such as soil erosion, soil degradation, and soil pollution caused by unreasonable development and utilization. As a result, the ecological environment in the red soil area is deteriorating, and the potential productivity of the red soil resources cannot be effectively used (Liu et al., 2012 ; Wang et al., 2020 ), thereby seriously affecting the sustainable land development of land in the south.  4.3 Evolution of the spatiotemporal pattern of the SLU level 4.3.1 Evolution characteristics of global spatial pattern This study uses GeoDa software to calculate the global Moran's I indexes of the SLU levels of 30 provinces in China from 2002 to 2018. The results are shown in Fig. 7   to facilitate the discussion on the indexes' spatial distribution and evolution. The global Moran's I indexes pass the test at the 0.05 significance level, indicating that the SLU level in China has significant global spatial autocorrelation characteristics and is not spatially distributed randomly. The global Moran's I indexes in some years decreased slightly but showed an upward trend as a whole; moreover, all indexes were positive values. This result indicates that over time, the degree of correlation between the SLU levels in various provinces increased, shifting from weak agglomeration to strong agglomeration.  4.3.2 Evolution characteristics of local spatial pattern To analyze the change characteristics of the spatial agglomeration of interprovincial SLU levels, this study uses GeoDa software in calculating the local Moran's I indexes from 2002 to 2018 (Fig. 8  ). The Sankey charts of the local Moran's I indexes (Fig. 9  ) are also generated to show the mutual conversion relationship between various provinces in the four research periods (2005, 2010, 2015, 2018). The local Moran's I index classifies the spatial agglomeration status of the SLU level into four types: (1) H–H type (high value agglomeration areas with SLU level), (2) H–L type (high value areas with SLU levels surrounded by low value areas), (3) L–H type (low value areas with SLU levels surrounded by low value areas), (4) L–L type (low value agglomeration areas with SLU levels). Fig. 8  shows that the growth in the number of H–H-type provinces fluctuated over time. By 2008, the number of H–H-type provinces exceeded that of L–L-type provinces. This result indicates that H–H-type provinces can promote the SLU levels of surrounding provinces through industrial transfer, technology diffusion, labor migration, resource sharing, and enterprise cooperation and make them eliminate low-level path dependence. However, the number of L–H-type provinces is greater than those of H–L-type and L–L-type provinces. This difference is due to some provinces absorbing most of the talents, funds, resources, and other elements in the local area. Under the siphon effect, the opportunity for the SLU of neighboring provinces to improve is not available to the central province. Hence, a development mode with high center and low surroundings is formed, that is, a development mode with a high SLU level in the central provinces and a low SLU level in the surrounding provinces. Fig. 9  shows that the H–H-type provinces are mainly distributed in the eastern and northeastern regions. The northeastern region is an important industrial base that serves as the main grain producing area and agricultural production base in China. Since the implementation of the Northeast Revitalization Strategy, the government has reformed and supported the traditionally advantageous industries in the northeastern region through the introduction of industrial and enterprise adjustment policies. This condition has led to the continuous improvement of the economic level of the northeastern region and the continuous optimization of the industrial structure, thereby enhancing the sustainable development of urban land. In addition, the northeastern region has the largest plain in China—the Northeast Plain, which plays an important role in maintaining the efficient development of agriculture and ensuring food security. The land use type is mainly cultivated land. The Chinese government has provided strong support in terms of policy, technology, and capital, and the degree of SLU has been continuously strengthened (Li et al.,2017 , 2020 ). L–L-type provinces are mainly distributed in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. In terms of climate, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia experience typical continental temperate semiarid climates, and they are sensitive areas that are prone to land desertification. In addition, the land in this area generally has a thin soil layer, obvious desertification, and low soil fertility. After land reclamation, problems, such as soil erosion, land desertification, and soil salinization, tend to occur (Meng et al., 2018 ; Guo et al., 2017 ). Therefore, how to prevent land desertification in the process of large-scale agricultural development is a scientific problem that needs to be solved urgently for sustainable and effective land use in this area. In addition, oasis city is a type of city under special natural conditions in arid areas. Xinjiang is the main distribution area of oasis cities in arid regions and belongs to a typical oasis economy. Compared with other types of cities, oasis cities are more dependent on natural factors and are the most sensitive areas of human–land relationships. Especially when urban spatial expansion and ecological degradation show a two-way recursive pattern development on the change of land use landscape, the effect of external squeeze from urban expansion and internal erosion of ecological degradation, it causes a severe decrease in the water and pasture areas of oasis cities. Therefore, in Xinjiang oasis cities, the stability of the ecological landscape around the city while rationally planning urban faces greater challenges (Liu et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2014 ). Inner Mongolia has a vast territory and is characterized by fragile ecology, scattered production factors, strong dependence on resources, and fragile natural ecological environment of the land. In addition, the land use of most cities in Inner Mongolia has phenomena, such as insufficient construction land development, irrational land use structure, and waste of land resources. Therefore, while developing resource-based industries, attention should be paid to the protection and restoration of the ecological environment of the land to prevent unrecoverable land waste (Lei et al., 2012 ) and then improve the SLU level in the region. This study divides the spatiotemporal transition modes of SLU levels into four types. Type A means that the province itself undergoes transition and that the surrounding provinces remain unchanged. Type B means that the province itself remains unchanged, but that the surrounding areas undergo transition. Type C means that the province itself and the surrounding areas have undergone a transition. Type D means that neither the province itself nor the surrounding provinces have undergone transition. The most common type of spatiotemporal transition is type D. That is, the SLU of the province unit itself and that of the neighboring provinces have maintained the same level of change, indicating that the spatial structure of the SLU level exhibits certain fixed characteristics. In addition, transition types A and B occur frequently, reflecting that spatial proximity has a significant effect on the SLU levels of some provinces. Compared with the other types, type C is less likely to occur. In general, whether the diffusion of land use technology occurs between provinces may promote the convergence or divergence of SLU levels among provinces. This effect influences the overall spatial structure of the SLU levels in China. Take China's agricultural technology promotion as an example. Agricultural science and technology are the internal driving factors of China's agricultural economic development, especially in breeding, land improvement, and efficient use of land resources (Rocha et al., 2020 ). However, practical problems, such as insufficient funds, insufficient personnel, and imperfect management systems in agricultural science and technology promotion, exist and have led to an unbalanced development of SLU in various provinces (Gao et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the projects of improved varieties, fertile fields, land reclamation, and scientific and technological demonstrations in comprehensive agricultural development need to be further expanded to implement the promotion of various technical methods. In addition, investment in agricultural infrastructure should be guaranteed, and effective methods, seeds, and technologies in comprehensive agricultural development should be used. At the same time, the promotion and training of agricultural science and technology must be strengthened to promote the coordinated development of SLU in various provinces.    5 Discussion This study draws a radar chart of the SLU levels and target level indicators among provinces in China from 2002 to 2018 to analyze the relationship between them (Fig. 10  ). A significant gap is observed in the SLU levels of the provinces. The SLU level in each province is between 2 and 2.5, and most provinces are in a relatively unsustainable state; only the SLU levels of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang are higher than 3, which indicates a relatively sustainable state (Fig. A1 ). The SLU levels of Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Fujian, and Jilin are between 2.5 and 3, which indicates a moderate sustainable state (Appendix A1 ). The main reasons are as follows:(1) Efficient and intensive land use. The realization of this goal is the main driving force for the improvement of SLU levels in China. Take Jiangsu and Zhejiang as examples. Relative to the other provinces, the two provinces have no substantial difference in the degree of achievement of Goals B and C. The improvement of the SLU level mainly depends on the realization of Goal A. Take urban land as an example. In the context of rapid urbanization and under the current frameworks of urban–rural dual land systems, financial systems, and political achievement evaluation mechanisms, the rapid urbanization development model with land finance and land attract investment as the core driving force can easily cause land urbanization to be significantly faster than population, economic, and industrial urbanization. Traditional urbanization leads to urban sprawl, low land use efficiency, and low population density, which directly weaken the effect of agglomeration economy. In addition, local governments are inclined to invest in productive functions, but they ignore nonproductive investments, such as public infrastructure and public service investment, the consequences of which are likely to lead to low quality urbanization. New urbanization promotes the formation of the spatial agglomeration of various production factors through agglomeration economy, industrial upgrading, technological innovation, and investment expansion. Thus, it helps realize the efficient and intensive use of land, which is specifically manifested in the rationalization of land use intensity, the maximization of land income, and the optimization of land use structure.  (2) Protection and improvement of the ecological environment of land. Ecological problems caused by land degradation factors, such as soil salinization, soil erosion, and soil heavy metal pollution, have become important factors restricting the improvement of SLU levels. Take Henan and Hebei as example; although Goals A and C of these two provinces have been achieved to a certain extent, the SLU levels have remained low. The main reason is that they ignore the emission of environmental pollutants in the process of land use. The improvement of land economic efficiency in these provinces is unsustainable and is implemented at the expense of ecological and environmental benefits. Take agricultural land as an example. At present, China has generally implemented a high-input and high-yield agricultural land use mode. The widespread use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural equipment has increased land economic benefits and ensured food security. However, it has also brought about serious problems, such as agricultural nonpoint source pollution. Therefore, improving the environmental efficiency of the agricultural land use system and reducing the input of elements and environmental output of harmful substances are key to achieving the steady improvement of the sustainable development of agricultural land use.  (3) Acceptance by society. In terms of land protection, emphasis should be placed on whether farmers are aware of land ecological protection. Whether farmers can pay attention to environmental protection in the process of land use and whether they recognize the sustainable land management strategy formulated by the government are important factors affecting SLU. As shown in the radar chart, the degree of fit between Goal C and the SLU level is high, indicating that Goal C exerts a significant effect on the SLU level. Social exchange theory believes that human behavior is affected by certain exchange activities that can bring rewards or punishments (Ma et al., 2019 ). As a rational economic man, a farmer's behavior is driven by various interests. Therefore, in the process of land protection, farmers' perception of costs and benefits influence their protection behavior. However, most rural areas in China still have issues, such as low family income, imperfect rural social security system, insufficient awareness of agricultural policies, and low compensation standards for cultivated land protection. These issues have significantly increased the risk perception of farmers participating in cultivated land conservation farming. Social contradictions endanger the stable governance of rural society and are not conducive to the construction of a harmonious society. Therefore, in the future, the economic income of farmers should be improved through interest adjustment, legal reconstruction, social reform, and strict implementation to optimize the allocation efficiency of land resources and labor resources and promote SLU.    This study can be further improved in the following aspects:(1) The comprehensive evaluation results show that the SLU level in China has generally risen, but the overall level is not high. The evaluation results basically reflect the changes in SLU in various regions and provinces in China. This shows that the SLU evaluation index system constructed on the basis of the SDG framework is feasible. However, given limited available data, the selection of evaluation indicators in this study is not perfect. For example, land pollution only considers pesticides, chemical fertilizers, agricultural plastic films, industrial wastewater, and industrial wastes. Other agricultural, industrial, and domestic pollution are not included. In addition, the construction of the evaluation index system of this study is specifically aimed at the resource endowments and socioeconomic development status of each province in China and should be appropriately increased or decreased when applied to other countries or regions.  (2) In terms of research scale, this study evaluates the SLU levels of various regions and provinces in China on a macro scale and obtains the overall evaluation results. However, the lack of evaluation at the municipal and village scales cannot provide refined guidance for SLU at the meso and micro scales. The spatial difference in the SLU level in China at different research scales and whether the advantages of SLU can be complemented and coordinated need to be further explored.  (3) Existing SLU evaluation methods, such as the gray cluster analysis method, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, matter element analysis, and artificial neural network, need to determine the grading standard before evaluation. The influencing mechanism is complex because of many factors affecting the SLU level. Moreover, testing methods to determine whether the selected classification standards are reasonable are limited. In addition, the traditional multifactor comprehensive evaluation method uses the weighted average method to integrate the influence of multiple factors into a single index for evaluation, and weight determination is key. At present, the subjective weight determination method used is affected by subjective factors, and the weights determined by different experts are not unique. Therefore, the evaluation results must be different. The exploratory data analysis method driven by sample data—PP method can overcome the above shortcomings (Table A2 ). However, the PP method has a large amount of calculation, which limits the in-depth study and wide application of this method to a certain extent. The accelerated genetic algorithm based on real coding can solve such problems. In the future, theoretical research on various optimization algorithms should be strengthened. Furthermore, in accordance with the socioeconomic and natural environment characteristics of different regions, intelligent optimization models and software that meet the actual characteristics of the region must be developed. This has an irreplaceable guiding role in reducing land pollution and improving the level of SLU.    Based on these conclusions, this study recommends the following policies:(1) For provinces that have obtained economic growth at the expense of large amounts of investment of land resources, ecological resources, and material resources, the Chinese government should accelerate the adjustment of the structure of economic development and energy consumption and focus on the development of industries with regional characteristics. The Chinese government should also focus on increasing the proportion of nonproductive public expenditure to ensure the diversification and sustainability of urban and rural development. In addition, a financial transfer payment mechanism between development and reserve zones, upstream and downstream areas, ecological conservation and ecological benefit zones, and main grain producing and main grain sales areas should be established to promote the fair development of SLU levels among provinces.  (2) For provinces with a fragile ecology, complex natural environment, harsh climatic conditions, and high intensity of land development, the Chinese government should formulate relevant land use policies on the basis of local conditions when promoting SLU to promote the healthy and coordinated development of the economy and land ecological protection. Forest land and grassland in northern forest–grass–agriculture–pastoral areas are seriously degraded. Therefore, the return of cultivated land to forest and grassland should be implemented, along with a strict policy of rest grazing and prohibiting grazing. Southern red soil hilly areas should promote green land use with ecological recycling agriculture, control the use standards of production inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural plastic films), and improve the regional soil environment. Southwest rocky desertification areas should improve flood control and waterlogging prevention and strengthen the control of watershed pollution and soil erosion. In addition, land ecological engineering projects and land ecological security barriers should be established. The compound erosion area of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau should focus on protecting glaciers, snowy areas, frozen sources, and alpine meadow ecosystems to curb land ecological degradation. The land ecological environment in ecologically fragile areas is complex. In the future, the characteristics of small-scale geographic units should be fully considered to ensure the development of the land ecological environment.  (3) For provinces with extensive land use and urban disorder sprawl in urban development, a key factor is to realize the intensive use of land because the industrial structure largely determines the allocation effect of scarce resources. The eastern region should control the overcrowding of certain industries in specific areas and try to avoid the negative effect of uneconomic agglomeration on SLU. The central region should use the promotion of regional advantageous industries as a breakthrough to optimize the allocation of land resources and industrial layout and accelerate the pace of industrial restructuring. Industrial development in the western region must focus on the conservation and recycling of land resources, vigorously develop a recycling economy, comprehensively promote clean production, promote the utilization of pollutants and waste materials, and embark on the path of sustainable land development. The northeastern region should realize the industrial transformation of resource-based cities and improve the level of regional sustainable development.  (4) For provinces with poverty-stricken areas (poor natural resource endowments, low land resource carrying capacity, inconvenient transportation, and poor public service infrastructure), the lack of land resources and low utilization efficiency have become one of the main bottlenecks restricting the economic and social development of poor areas. As an important way to replenish cultivated land, revitalize stock land, optimize urban and rural land, strengthen intensive land use, and increase land production capacity, land consolidation exerts a positive effect on the promotion of regional poverty reduction and realization of rural revitalization. Therefore, the positive role of land consolidation must be maximized in poverty alleviation and development. In the future, efforts should be focused on further innovating and improving the rural land consolidation policy mechanism; establishing a government-led, multisubject joint investment financing model; realizing the organic connection between land consolidation and various urban and rural planning; and clarifying the rural property rights system and farmers' benefit distribution system to achieve the goal of SLU with land consolidation as the carrier.     6 Conclusion Based on the SDG framework, this study constructs an evaluation index system for SLU in China. The system is composed of three dimensions, namely, efficient and intensive land use, protection and improvement of the ecological environment of the land, and acceptance by society. The RAGA–PP technique and the ESDA model are used to describe systematically the spatiotemporal patterns and evolution characteristics of the SLU levels of 30 provinces in China and reveal their spatial distribution laws among provinces. The main conclusions are as follows:(1) The SLU levels in China from 2002 to 2018 showed a fluctuating upward trend, as well as certain phase characteristics. Moreover, the overall level was not high. The time series trend characteristics of different provinces are significantly different, and the SLU levels in the four regions are ranked as follows: eastern region > northeast region > central region > western region.  (2) The spatial trend surface shows that the SLU level in China presents significant spatial imbalance. In the east–west direction of the province, the spatial evolution trend of the SLU level is characterized as high in the east and low in the west. For the north–south direction, it is characterized as high in the north and low in the south.  (3) The results of the global spatial autocorrelation analysis show that the spatial agglomeration of the SLU levels among provinces in China has continuously strengthened over time and that the spatial correlation has evolved from weak correlation to strong correlation. The H–H agglomeration area is mainly distributed in the eastern and northeastern regions. The L–L agglomeration area is mainly distributed in the western region. The spatiotemporal transition measurement method shows that the SLU level in China has a certain path dependence on the spatial structure changes among provinces.  (4) From the provincial level, the SLU level among provinces in China is unbalanced. Goal A occupies a leading position in the process of promoting SLU levels. Goal B and Goal C are regressing among different provinces. Therefore, the joint realization of the three goals is a key factor in promoting the improvement of SLU.
