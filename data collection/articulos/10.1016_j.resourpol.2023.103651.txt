                  Every country's primary economic objective is to accomplish sustainable economic growth. In this area, there has been much discussion of the significance of natural resources in the research; moreover, there has yet to be much research on how these resources affect the monetary inclusion of emerging nations. This research utilized China's management of funds, technological development, and unpredictability of economic strategy to examine the viability of the resources curse theory concerning financial growth. Quantile autoregressive distribution lag (QARDL), a cutting-edge methodology, was used to evaluate the asymmetry relationship between variables from 1970 to 2015. The resources constraint theory, which contends that the rents from environmental assets constrain economic advancement, is backed up by research data for China. Volatility in economic strategy also harms financial growth. Contrarily, financial diversification and technical advancement sped up economic development and offset the drawbacks of environmental assets. According to the results, appropriate natural resource utilization, funding redistribution at local administration levels, and a shift towards green initiatives should all be put in place as semiconducting short- and long-term marketing strategies and regulatory requirements to turn the blight into a full endorsement.

Every country's primary economic objective is to accomplish sustainable economic growth. In this area, there has been much discussion of the significance of natural resources in the research; moreover, there has yet to be much research on how these resources affect the monetary inclusion of emerging nations. This research utilized China's management of funds, technological development, and unpredictability of economic strategy to examine the viability of the resources curse theory concerning financial growth. Quantile autoregressive distribution lag (QARDL), a cutting-edge methodology, was used to evaluate the asymmetry relationship between variables from 1970 to 2015. The resources constraint theory, which contends that the rents from environmental assets constrain economic advancement, is backed up by research data for China. Volatility in economic strategy also harms financial growth. Contrarily, financial diversification and technical advancement sped up economic development and offset the drawbacks of environmental assets. According to the results, appropriate natural resource utilization, funding redistribution at local administration levels, and a shift towards green initiatives should all be put in place as semiconducting short- and long-term marketing strategies and regulatory requirements to turn the blight into a full endorsement.   Keywords Renewable energy  Financial integration  Sub-Saharan Asia  Energy sources    1 Introduction The carbon cycle may be thrown off and temperature rises can occur due to environmental changes (Maestrini et al., 2017 ). Recent writing has characterized climate inequality as a complex problem. Carbon dioxide emissions are regarded by conservationists as the primary source of pollution which in turn leads to rising temperatures and other climatic anomalies (J. S. Liu et al., 2013 ). Environmental carbon footprints account for over 81% of greenhouse gas releases (Saranga, 2009 ). Physical, physiological, and ecological consequences may result from it such as severe weather events including periods of drought, storms, and heat shocks; the elevation of ocean levels; and the depletion of natural resources (Olesen et al., 2015 ). Increases in the production of greenhouse gases risk having far-reaching consequences for animal and plant life The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal aimed to improve the quality of life for all people everywhere while also preventing the acceleration of environmental degradation. The core strategy plan for government entities should focus on improving environmental quality and achieving sustainable growth (Ullah et al., 2020 ). Therefore, for economic development to be sustainable, officials need to pinpoint the key economic factors causing ecological concerns (see Table 1–3    , Figs. 1–7        ). Government expenditure and development many nations' GDPs (Ruiz and Sirvent, 2016 ). Governments worldwide have implemented collective economic strategies in response to the global financial crisis to revive their flagging economies. If these policies prioritize economic development at the expense of everything else it might have disastrous results. Industrial development, expenditures, and overall economic growth may all benefit from monetary policy changes like increasing financial supply and decreasing the interest rate. This demonstrates that interest rates and government expenditures are cyclical, contributing to excessive nonrenewable energy use (J. Liu et al., 2018 ). Macroeconomic policies are closely monitored at different phases of economic development to ensure sustainable growth Carbon emissions are often stimulated by traditional macroeconomic instruments such as monetary and fiscal policy (Randall and Theodore Farris, 2009 ). Numerous research (Randall and Farris, 2009 ) among others, have shown that fiscal policies may impact the environmental status of many established and rising nations. Transformation policies aren't always designed to boost environmental standards, but it's essential to consider how they could affect other measures (Umair and Dilanchiev, 2022 ). Establishing fiscal policies led to the emergence of many elements, including the industrial revolution, the usage of energy, and economic growth, all of which contributed to ecological deterioration Carbon taxes reduce pollution (Ellinger et al., 2011 ) and environmental rules may discourage economic entrepreneurs and components (Wagner et al., 2012 ). Reduced carbon dioxide emissions and increased production of clean energy goods result from stringent taxing regulations on the use of fossil fuels in manufacturing. Government investment might increase carbon dioxide emissions if economic development is prioritized while investing in wellness and education raises environmental consciousness and encourages greener practices (Wong et al., 2008 ). The government's investment in better colleges and management also benefits global security. Controlling sustainable growth on the regional level requires strict attention to environmental protection. The importance of adopting renewable energy sources is rising as environmental risks increase Reduced negative effects of hazardous discharge mean better air quality (Pavlínek, 2015 ). Businesses are reluctant to use renewable energy sources during manufacturing because of the government's inadequate strategies, preferring to stick to tried-and-true, low-cost production techniques (Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2011 ). Energy-related emissions significantly contribute to global warming, but governments have difficulty controlling them. Due to the present severe condition of climate change and challenges to ecological responsibility, the use of renewable energy resources is encouraged. There is an immediate need to replace petroleum fuel-based goods with those made from renewable resources Carbon-free renewable energy sources are reliable for protecting the planet. Rapid economic expansion in emerging nations directly results from their abundance of energy resources (S. L. Li, 2006 ). Non-renewable consumption of energy activities is exploiting the resource-rich emerging nations. As a result, the rent from natural resources is a significant factor in determining total CO2 output. Natural resources may be pivotal in facilitating environmental sustainability and economic growth. Sustainability in both the economy and the environment depends on a steady supply of natural resources They are essential in promoting economic growth and environmental health, and there are enough of them (Reiner and Hofmann, 2006 ). Humans are damaging the ecosystem although woods fishing spots, farms, ranches, and developed places all help mitigate this impact. But using natural resources like fossil fuels is bad for the planet. As a result, the violence of these resources is the top be concerned for economies in the emerging world. Ecosystems in emerging change(resource-rich) countries are being damaged by the widespread use of natural resources (Lambert and Pohlen, 2001 ). Countries that rely heavily on exports of natural resources need to put those resources to good use by turning them into a driver of sustainability environmental sustainability Many studies, ranging in the number of participants and methodological sophisticated, analyze the correlation between natural resources and environmental parameters in industrialized and developing nations Natural resource extraction methods and consumption rates significantly contribute to national income As a result of environmental depletion, industrial capacity has declined, which has had a chilling effect on biodiversity. Governments should reduce the wasteful use of natural resources and replace outdated technical practices with more environmentally friendly ones (Biddle et al., 1997 ). In this way, human beings may benefit from nature by supporting sustainable energy. Macroeconomic strategies must be shaped to encourage the use of renewable energy sources throughout the nation, which will help to preserve the nation's abundant resources and spur economic development. Climate bonds issuance market reception (Lin and Okyere, 2023 ) climate bonds price ceiling (Alharbi et al., 2023 ) and green bond bonus level are all studied in the existing research on sustainable finance) (Fang et al., 2022 ). By analyzing the function of green banking in the hydropower sector, which is both directly important to conservation and a solution to senior energy supplies, we move the research on a more serious path. Our findings corroborate the claim that access to capital is crucial for decreasing fossil fuel dependence and fostering sustainably by showing that green financing increases sustainable energy output over the medium and near term. Second, we clarify the functional form of sustainable power, adding to the literature on the topic. Research by (Wang and Zhi, 2016 )shows a correlation between corporate technology practices and increasing interest from financial experts. According to (Umair, 2022 ) corporations are more likely to talk about their impact on sustainability when they operate in environments that reward a lengthy perspective.1) Firstly, research at the national level highlights the banking industry's importance in using sustainable power. Furthermore, we target the creation of renewable energy processes.  2) Secondly, we build upon the work (L. Li et al., 2022 ) given that a broad measure of economic literacy may be disruptive in the environment of the generation of renewable energy capacity, we narrow our attention to green financing instead.  3) Finally, our study contributes to the ongoing discussion about the role of the marketing plan in helping to promote renewable energy sources (Dong et al., 2021 ).  4) Our findings demonstrate that lawmakers should prioritize removing systemic investor issues to facilitate the generation of clean energy through business methods. The remaining sections of the paper are laid out as follows. We will discuss the research that is pertinent to this topic.  5) The information and procedures are discussed in. Qualitative data collection, root unit panel analysis, and primary findings are presented. Some more financial tools are discussed. The inter-analyses are presented in.     2 Literature review Land resources, resources from minerals, resources associated with water, ecological resources, aquatic resources, climatic supplies, and other types of natural resources are all examples known as referred to as “natural resources” (Brandenburg, 2016 ). Natural resources have been a safety net for economic development and social advancement. The connection between these two factors has been the subject of much investigation. Economic development is assumed to be swift when a nation or area has an availability of resources (Charnes et al., 1978 ). Yet a large body of literature demonstrates that abundant natural resources do not automatically spur economic expansion but may slow it down, a phenomenon known in academia as the “resource curse.” The research on the dynamic between the two is well documented. However, the topic of this study is the connection between sources of sustainable energy and natural resources (F. Liu et al., 2023 ). One school of thought is that states with more abundant natural resources are better equipped to provide the energy industry with substantial quantities of essential and valuable resources. The potential for energy sustainability increases with the size of production developments based on natural resources, which provides incredible momentum and sources for expanding the renewable energy sector. A different school of thought holds that countries with plentiful natural resources are more likely to engage in profit-seeking and mismanagement, which in turn hinders the effective enforcement of laws meant to promote sustainable energy development。 While it's generally agreed that natural resources contribute to GDP growth, opinions differ on how they influence the progress of renewable energy. As a result, the present study puts forward the following working hypothesis: Natural resources have a favorable effect on the growth of alternative energy sources. 2.1 Developments in technology and the use of natural resources Three fundamental factors contribute to economic development, according to the current understanding of economic growth: capital, workers, and technical advancement, with the last being the most influential. The pace of technological advancement is the most significant predictor of economic growth over an extended period, whether in industrialized or emerging economies. Traditional approaches to advancing technology may be categorized as either technical innovation or technological introduction. In the wake of China's reform and opening up the country's technical development has transitioned from emphasizing technology introduction to technology development (C. Li and Umair, 2023 ). The financial statistics and structures will be affected differently depending on how technological advancement is approached and how regional foundations of factors are distributed. Natural areas with abundant resources are seen as more likely to be the ones that promote industrial development, experience fewer limited resources during economic growth, have more significant opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of resources, and have a natural benefit compared to natural resource-poor regions in terms of improving innovations in technology and transformation-use efficiency (Banker et al., 2004 ) Energy industry structures supporting innovations tend to be more comprehensive, which may create beneficial consequences for technological advancements. Countries rich in natural resources are more eager to develop energy industries led by natural resource advancement. On the other hand, it has been argued that natural areas with abundant resources tend to rely heavily on low-end expensive-to-implement sectors, which could lead to a transfer of creative talent from other sectors to the sector of natural resources and the primary industry sector, restricting creativity in the region as a whole and ultimately affecting technological progress (Bowlin, 1999 ) They also claim that areas with abundant natural resources are less likely to invest in innovative industries since their economies are biased toward natural resource advancement. This means that we need more empirical research on the impact of renewable resources on technological advancement. The same is true for the influence of the abundance of natural resources on technological development. On the one hand, natural resource-rich areas benefit from lower prices based on resources' primary goods and easier access to cutting-edge technology provided by foreign investors (H. Liu et al., 2021 ). However, natural regions with plentiful resources often develop a manufacturing environment centered on petroleum the extraction procedure; such an economy typically has low market activity and a hostile business climate, both of which can slow the adoption of new technologies (Asmild and Matthews, 2012 ). According to biased technical growth, the ratio of input factors to total outputs determines the structure of manufacture, affecting the geographic distribution of wealth. As a result, we are still determining how technological advancement will affect the growth of renewable energy sources. To begin, it is debatable whether technical advancement can promote progress toward more sustainable forms of energy production. Sustainable growth in energy may benefit from technical innovation, according to one theory. To begin, technological progress facilitates the replacement of manufacturing elements. Due to the importance of energy in manufacturing, renewable energy development has been shown to benefit from technological advances that increase energy efficiency through the creation of a reciprocal substitute between power, employment, and capital (Demerjian et al., 2012 ) Second, technological improvements aid in using renewable energy fuels or raw materials, allowing for the clean, low-carbon, and influential utilization of fossil fuel energy resources like coal. Moreover, advancements in energy effectiveness brought about by technological advancements aid in slowing the overall increase in the usage of energy (Adler et al., 2002 ) But another school of thought says technology advancements only sometimes help with green energy research and production. To begin, technical innovation only sometimes leads to significant technological advancement, at least in the near term, since there is an opportunity cost associated with it that must be weighed against any potential advantages to the sector. Second, the quality of existing infrastructure and governing institutions significantly affects the viability of technological innovation (H. Liu et al., 2022 ). Technological advancement requires both a well-developed infrastructure and high-quality institutions. Third, the effects of technical change on the growth of renewable energy sources still need to be determined. Some criteria determine whether or not the introduction of technology may lead to technological advancement for renewable energy development (Najafi and Zolfagharinia, 2021 ). First, technical advancement may aid in developing sustainable energy sources when the new technology is well-suited to the local natural resource endowment. Second, one's capacity for assimilation and processing of technology is a limiting factor in the extent to which technological introduction may lead to technological advancement. The ability to take in and transform technology, which can develop production technology quicker while contributing to the enhancement of production productivity, is directly correlated with the basic competence of the technical introduction area. More empirical research is needed to determine the effects of technological innovation and technology implementation on progress toward a more sustainable energy future. This motivates the third assumption for further study: . Reviewed the feasibility of creating green observations in Asia as a strategy to back up conservation efforts. Results indicated that Asian nations should make an effort to meet the prerequisites for a robust market in green bonds. Green bonding and green power usage were investigated by (Brodny et al., 2021 )for the Asian economies between 2003 and 2019. Using a scaling panel method, the findings showed that released debt securities had a considerable beneficial impact on installing green power and reducing carbon pollution. The primary purpose of this article will be to examine the problem and the link between the factors listed in the survey group of Asian nations, with a focus on the development of renewable energy utilization and the effect of the two factors of industry and securities on it.   3 Econometric methodology 3.1 Theoretical framework The structure of atmospheric carbon dioxide releases may be explained mainly by macroeconomic policy. These regulations foster optimistic investment and manufacturing scenarios nationwide. Businesses would profit from a more business-friendly monetary policy. The public could borrow money from the bank at a fair interest rate. This kind of action motivates the launch of new businesses, contributing to economic expansion. Carbon emissions are also affected by the economic policy (government spending). The magnitude of fiscal policy helps raise national income, which in turn helps enhance environmental quality. The industrial revolution is the conduit via which financial regulations are connected since an enhanced production industry increases energy demand. Excessive use of energy results in the exploitation of natural resources and the subsequent degradation of the natural environment。 In light of the above the variables in the present investigation were employed in the following econometric model;(1) C E i t   = β 0  + β 1  M P  i t   + β 2  F P  i t   + β 3  N R  i t   + β 4  R E  i t   + β 5  Y i t   + μ i t       Where CO2 emissions (CE), actual interest rates (MP), tax revenues, natural resource rent (NR), renewable energy conservation (RE), and economic growth (Y) are all variables. “it” in the subscript denotes the ith nation at time t.  3.2 Model specification The research looks at how Asian nations' access to international finance has influenced their ability to generate sustainable power. Preliminary mathematical work has been done to establish a connection between direct investment, and the generation of sustainable power good case may be made for more economic activity. Energy use would benefit from more portfolio investment brought about by capital inflows and an increase in bridge foreign investment. As a result, more money is being poured into renewable energy sources. Furthermore, financial inclusion enables businesses and governments to have cheaper access to foreign finance, which may be utilized to extend current systems or construct new facilities, expanding clean energy output. In light of these considerations, and agreement with investments in clean energy, are described in terms of capital flow and a set of regulating different factor(2) r e n e w a b l e = f ( f i n g l o b , X  )       X is a matrix of regressors such as GDPP growth, oil prices, and economic deepening when sustainable is the total output of sustainable energy. Equation (2)  is obtained by writing eq (1)  in its complete quantitative form, with all parameters in logarithmic form.(3) r e n e w a b l e i t   = τ 0  + τ 1  f i n g l o b  i t   + β i  X i t   + ε i t       When i represents the number of contours in a given time interval (N), t represents the number of periods (T). An incorrect word was used, which is. To mitigate the effects of hetero skedasticity, we log all of the variables. Therefore, both are understood to be estimations. 3.2.1 Dependent variable Renewable power production per person is used to quantify the capacity factor of renewable power sources (in kilowatt-hours per capita). Hydroelectric, wind, sunlight, volcanic, garbage, and biofuels are all examples of renewable energy. This parameter has been frequently used to study how renewable energy affects economic development (Agbonifo, 2021 ). This parameter may be a surrogate for Latin Asia investments in sustainable energy expansion.  3.2.2 Variable of interest Several sources economic markets,” we mean the absence of barriers to the flow of money across nations. Various authors have used the measure of financial globalization ((Geng, 2021 )to quantify the degree to which two economies are interdependent financially (2018. De facto economic intermediation is the sum of legal economic markets, and de facto economic flows. Foreign investment, portfolio equity, international debt, currency reserves, external capital transfers, and stocks and overseas assets and obligations make up the de facto index of global capital flows. The effectiveness of governments in formulating laws and procedures that allow for the free movement of capital across borders is measured by the de jure economic globalization post. The number of I.I.A.s, capital limitations, and capital account openness are all examples of such regulations and policies(De Quincey, 2021 ). The expenditure on sustainable power in Latin Asia is linked positively with the degree to which capital systems are open. According to research by (Zhang et al., 2021 )globalization's favorable impact on finance sector growth might have a ripple effect across the economy. We hypothesize that a rise in the production of renewable energy would result from more excellent financial connectivity. This leads us to the following central theory.  3.2.3 Control variables We utilize certain factors that might explain the variations in a nation's renewable energy production ability to mitigate the bias of unobserved heterogeneity. Variables are chosen based on their prominence in the existing research. The first metric used as a stand-in for Productivity growth is per income per person. When a nation's economy improves, it should be able to funnel more money into industries that last, like the power industry. In addition, when people's disposable money rises, they may purchase greener products, particularly renewable energy. The results may be conflicting. Renewables and other eco-friendly products may be classified as luxury commodities (Lee, 2020 )the desire for which rises as nations develop economically discover that as economies progress, they produce less renewable power. This is in contrast to the situation in industrialized nations, where the reverse is true. Also, a group of emerging nations with middle incomes finds that an economic boom negatively impacts using renewable energy sources. Compared to the preceding report, the capacity factor of renewable power in Latin Asia countries increases when economic growth occurs. GDP per person is the standard by which we measure economic expansion. As a result, rising prosperity should boost the efficiency of renewable energy production. Using oil and gas prices, we additionally account for the impact of the cost of petroleum fuels (current dollars). In the context of the electricity sector, both exhaustible and sustainable energy sources are seen as equivalent. All else being equal, the demand hypothesis predicts that authorities and customers would shift toward renewable power sources if the price of nonrenewable rises. An opposite result, however, would suggest that renewable and nonrenewable energy sources complement one another. After that, we account for fiscal growth in our models. Economic innovations experts like argue that the financial sector is essential for maximizing economic growth by effectively mobilizing and distributing savings. This way, the financial system facilitates rapid technological advancement and innovation, boosting economic development. A plethora of studies highlight the importance of the finance industry in promoting economic growth. According toa financially stable and advanced energy industry may help finance the solar industry at reduced prices. However, the impact of economic development on sustainable power needs to be better understood since most previous research has instead looked at how it affects total energy use. Few researches look at how clean power is affected by monetary growth. To put it logically, a robust financial industry lowers financial danger and financing costs, increasing the money, development flow, and cutting-edge technologies devoted to the energy industry. A well-established money system may foster development in the power industry. Specifically, we use the amount of domestic credit extended to the private market as a percentage of GDP as a proxy for the health of the banking markets. These years have seen an increase in the use of this variable in scientific research.   3.3 Data and descriptive analyses We were using the information on five countries in Asia collected from 1985 to 2019 to analyze the impact of economic markets on the generation capacity of RE. We selected these nations and time frames for our analysis because they are well-represented in the data we have at hand. The amount of sustainable power finished installing is approximated by the amount of energy generated per person in kilowatt-hours. This data source comes from the EIA in the United States. The KOF Swiss Industrial Institute is the source of information for this article created the original world economy series, and (Bag et al., 2020 ) refined it to account for flow and tasks and the regulations, situations, and rules that make the worldwide flow of capital possible. The Asia Petroleum Quantitative Review of Nuclear Generation is mined for information on oil prices at $25/barrel (after adjusting for inflation using the Inflation Rate in the United States). Finally, the World Company's World Design Indicators provide us with data on per capita GDP ($ constant 2017) and residential credit issued to the private sector (% of GDP2023). Qualitative data for the factors is provided, and a Pearson correlation is shown.   4 Estimation approach Only with the bridge dependency experiment, we begin our scientific research. This is caused by unknown regression analysis, market volatility, and regional or overflow impacts. Inadequate consideration of the covariates may introduce a substantial bias into the analysis(Golosnoy et al., 2019 ) Consequently, the test developed by used in this investigation.(4) C D = 2 T  N ( N − 1  )     ( ∑ i = 1  N − 1   ∑ j = i + 1  N  ρ ˆ  i j     )  ⇒ N ( 0,1 )       To calculate the value of couple association, we use formulas ρ i j   ˆ     where N represents the number of inter and T represents the period. Inter-independence between the data is assumed as the anthropic principle of the test. To prevent false regressions, we then use the root test of the panel. The conventional panel normality assumption tests fail to detect CSD reliably. Here, accurate estimations may be obtained using third-unit root testing. We use the bridge cointegration (CADF), and Messaging (CIPS) tests to handle CSD. The accompanying bridge-enhanced model is used to calculate the CADF and CIPS data.(5) Δ y i t   = α i  + b  i  y i , t − 1   + c y ‾  t − 1   + d  i  Δ y ‾  t  + e  i t        In this case, Yit represents the sum of the lagging values and denotes the initial variances of the individual series. Here is how we calculate the CADF and CIPS.(6) C A D F = t i  ( N ; T  )  = Δ y i ′  M _  ω  y i , − 1    σ ˆ  i  ( y i ′  M _  ω  y i , − 1    )  1 2          In stage 3, we use Wester Lund's error-correcting strip regression analysis to investigate the potential evidence of a long connection between the parameters in model 1. This test considers differences in gradient and short-run fluctuations across units. The following is the form of the estimable framework:(7) Δ y i t   = δ i ′  d t  + α i  ( y i , t − 1   − β i ′  x i , t − 1    )  + ∑ j = 1  p i   α i j   Δ y i , t − j     + ∑ j = − q i   p i   γ i j   Δ x i , t − j     + e  i t        The test makes use of the following-constructed class median stats (Gτ and Gα) with frame facts (Pτ and Pα)(8) G T  = 1 N  ∑ i = 1  N  α i  ˆ  S E ( α i  ˆ  )    a n d G α  = 1 N    ∑ i = 1  N  T α i  ˆ   α i  ˆ  ( 1 )         (9) P T  = α ˆ  S E ( α ˆ  )    a n d P α  = T α ˆ       In each bridge S E ( α i  ˆ  )     the absence of evidence α i  ˆ     to the contrary, it is assumed that all bridges are uncorrelated (H0: αi = 0 for all i). for all I If the null hypothesis is dismissed for both Gt and G, then correlation must exist in at least one of the bridges. The presence of stationarity in the panel is also shown when the hypothesis for Pt and Pα is rejected. Finally, we use many evaluation approaches to guarantee the findings' reliability. First, we use the tried-and-true OLS, Repaired, and Random-effects model. These approaches depend on the fact that the mistakes are not heteroscedasticity and exhibit no serial correlation. Unfortunately, causality and CSD are ignored by these methods. They also can't tell long-term dynamics apart from short-term dynamics of the same type. Taking these things into consideration as shown below, it may be used to create a generic ARDL (p, q, q, q0) model.(10) Δ Y i t = λ i  Y i , t − j   + α i ′  X i , t − j   + ∑ j = 1  P − 1   λ i j   Δ Y i , t − j     + ∑ j = 0  q − 1   α i j  ′  Δ X i , t − j     + μ i  + ε i t        Yit  is the regression coefficient (the amount of energy produced per person), Xit  is a (4x1) matrix of control variables (economic assimilation, average wages, oil prices, economic deepening) (p, q, q, q) is the maximum lag length chosen through minimizing the Bic criterion, it is the fixed effects α i ′     i am these exact long-run specifications, α i j  ′     and λij is the short-run coefficients.The absence of stationarity is the starting point for the assumptions. If no correlation is found to exist, the following error correction model is predicted to emphasize the temporary dynamics:(11) Δ Y i t = δ i  e c m i , t − 1   + ∑ j = 1  P − 1   λ i j  *  Δ Y 2 i t − j     + ∑ j = 0  q − 1   θ i j  * ′   Δ X i t − j     + μ i  + ε i t       (12) δ i  = − ( 1 − ∑ m = j + 1  P  λ i j     )  α i *  = ∑ j = 0  q  θ i j   ( 1 − ∑ k  λ i k     )   λ i t  *  = −   ∑ m = j + 1  P  λ i m   θ i j  *  = −   ∑ m = j + 1  q  θ i m        Withi = 1, 2, …q-1 and j=1,2, …, p-1. The I parameter may measure approximation approach stability. It permits a long-term link among and its influencing forces; it must be negative. Also, researchers use the corrected version of the Mechanism of Measurements Linear Regression to probe the imbalanced effects of financial connectivity nonrenewable energy capability. This allows for identifying the provisional homogenous correlation of independent variables by permitting the impacts to influence the complete diffusion instead of merely moving means as classic parametric models do. This is in contrast to the traditional instrumental variables appraiser devised and enhanced(Marmolejo-Saucedo, 2020 ). This was helpful since it generates econometric time series estimates that do not cross. Following is an approximation of the dependent distributions QY (|X) for a concept of the location-scale variance:(13) Y i t   = τ i  + X i t  ′  β + ( α i  + Z i t  ′  γ  )  μ i t        Therefore, the possibility is given, P ( α i  + Z i t  ′  γ ≻ 0  )  = 1    and the calculated coefficients are (τ, β′, α, γ′) These distinct explanatory variables are I I when I = 1, …, n. Z is a k-vector of recognized elements of X that are vibrational modifications, where unit Z l  = Z l  ( X )     is provided by l = 1, …, k. Xit and time t, Xit , and Uit  for each cross-section were randomly and uniformly averaged. Consider the Uit  must meet the minimum criteria by being perpendicular to X and normalized. Given the above, equation (9)  implies that.(14) Q Y  ( φ | X i t    )  = ( τ i  + α i  q ( φ )   )  + X i t  ′  β + Z i t  ′  γ q ( φ )       X is a matrix of the regressors stated in the record in Equation (9) . It is based on the position of the scalar on predictors and represents the statistical range of the bivariate analysis (per capita renewable energy output in kilowatt-hours). The scalar parameter Xit . Indicates the fixed impact of the median value for the bridge i. The τ ( φ )  = τ i  + α i  q ( φ )     composite score found by resolving the minimization issue after(15) min q  ∑ i  ∑ t  λ φ  ( R i t   − ( α i  + Z i t  ′  γ  )  q  )          λ φ  ( A )  = ( φ − 1  )  A I { A ≤ 0  }  + T A I { A ≻ 0  }     Is used to verify for toughness.  5 Empirical results and discussion All results are reported and analyzed in this section. Well, before evaluations are presented, the key results are discussed in conclusion. 5.1 Pre-estimation and principal results Therefore, Natural resources support renewable energy sources development, confirming study hypothesis H1. The following are some possible explanations: There will be more incentives and sources of growth in the economy, as well as capacity for energy sustainability, in the provinces that are rich in mineral resources because (1) they can offer an extensive supply of essential goods and producing assets, which means there is a higher level of manufacturing that can be constructed with natural resources(Z. Li et al., 2021 ). (2) The role that markets play in advancing renewable energy is more significant if a more significant percentage of resources are distributed via market processes and if the use of resources efficiency is high. Third, the inefficient distribution of energy resources is impeded by corruption, which leads to the misuse of government authority, distorts the use of resources and damages the regulation of the financial economy and competitive order. (4) The high transaction prices caused by information inequalities are mitigated by the internet-mediated market transaction, which also leads to better resource usage and energy efficiency。 Increases in wealth allow for more investments in energy sector human resources, R&D, and procedure enhancement, all of which contribute to more significant energy conservation and sustainability。 More people living in cities means more energy to support their daily lives, which is terrible for the environment and the economy (Agrell and Hatami-Marbini, 2013 ). Errors in measuring methods or distinct variables are possible sources of bias in empirical research. Therefore, we conducted a robust study by changing the explanation factors, explanatory variables, and regression technique. This study begins by recalculating the sustainable energy growth rate without the described factors, using the coefficient of variation technique instead. Table 5    empirical data show that when the explanatory factors are removed, the positive and substantial association between environmental resources and feasible energy development persists (coefficient = 19.284, p 0.1). Corruption and the number of people are limiting factors in sustainable energy development (H. Liu, 2022 ), whereas accessibility to the Internet and capital stock are enabling factors. Sustainable energy growth has no real relationship with commercialization levels. Also, the regression findings are consistent and dependable when using the least square approach, random variability model, or fixed-effects approach. The excessive dependence on resources contributes to the resource curse hypothesis since it reduces local and international investment opportunities. The resource curse may also result from a need for more expertise in effectively using these assets (Zhao et al., 2021 )Furthermore, just five quantiles in the low to medium range (0.05–0.40) reveal a favorable and substantial effect of the decentralization of fiscal authority on financial development, according to the QARDL long-run projections for decentralization of finances. The article explains how China benefited greatly from fiscal decentralization, which gave lower levels of government control over collecting taxes and spending public money. Financial efficiency is improved in several ways, including increased local control, promoting financed and self-financing layouts, and establishing parity among state entities. Research by (Seiford and Zhu, 1999 ) which supports fiscal decentralization as a key factor in establishing financial stability, is consistent with our findings. Similarly, the QARDL long-term estimations generated positive and significant long-run coefficient values for technological advancement in the 0.05–0.31 and 0.70–0.96 quantiles. However, the 0.40–0.70 quantiles imply the insignificance of technological advancement on economic growth (Tracey et al., 2005 ).all find results consistent with these hypotheses. Manufacturing processes were stimulated, and high returns were encouraged due to technological innovation that followed decreased production costs Additionally, technological development has strengthened the country's financial system by decreasing market flaws and bolstering monetary functions (Amirteimoori and Kordrostami, 2013 ). To account for variability and bridge dependency, we also evaluated our models that used the group QARDL model. These PMG and MG models are distinguished using the Hausman specification test. The estimations from the PMG group are accurate based on the negligibly small P-values for the Hausman averages. As a result, the discussions will concentrate on the estimations in Table 6    sections 1, 3, and 5 . The converging ratios are still statistically significant for all of the calculated models using the PMG in Table 6 (H. Liu and Zhao, 2022 ) That finding shows that the total capacity of sustainable power and its drivers have a mistaken process. More significantly, for the models with the company's financial inclusion, de facto overall financial collaboration, a 3% variance in the long-run optimal point will withdraw the renewable energy generation by 25%, 27%, and 30% in the following year combined (see Table 7 ). 5.1.1 Alternative estimating techniques In this work, in order to evaluate the robustness of the estimations, we use the dynamic OLS in addition to the entirely updated OLS. Both of these methods are based on the original OLS. They take into account the endogeneity of the variables, as well as their serial correlation and endogenous CSD, in addition to the heterogeneity and CSD that could create bias. According to the findings shown in Table 8     , the de jure component of global financial integration has statistically positive and optimistic long-term implications for the installed capacity of renewable energy. In spite of the fact that the FMOLS is the only approach where the beneficial effect of de facto integration is statistically significant, the situation remains unchanged. Furthermore, economic growth is necessary to increase the generation capacity of renewable energy, but the price of crude oil has a key role in explaining fluctuations in generation capacity. This is because economic growth is essential to improve generating capacity. Even at the present time, the level of financial progress has a depressive impact that is statistically significant on the DOLS model. These findings offer substantial backing for the concept that increased financial integration will lead to an increase in the capacity of a region to produce renewable energy (see Table 9–11 ).  5.1.2 Accounting for distributional heterogeneity This research uses repaired parametric regression to determine how direct investment affects the expected variance of renewable energy-generating ability. One characteristic of a data set is that many series often include extremes and are not approximated (Wu and Xu, 2020 ). Therefore, conventional econometric methods provide non-robust approximations. We use the Model of Memories Least Squares, including fixed effects, to factor in the differential variation. Present the results of a parametric multiple regressions for such models to average financial integration ratios, including both. Additionally, we have defined three probability density distances: limited wind power capacity (between the ninth and 31st quantiles), intermediate hydropower capacity (between the 30th and 60th quantiles), as well as high renewable Unlike previous research findings point to a hopeful relationship between financial incorporation and the production of clean energy, though this relationship only slightly improves with increasing capacity factor. To put life in perspective, a 2% increase in the world associated with managing index boosts electricity production by roughly 0.736%–0.876% in the nations with the most negligible capacity factor, 0.420%–0.564% in nations with the center capacity, and 0.360%–0.469% in countries with a high capacity essentially, our results demonstrate a clear link between financial integration and the generation of renewable energy. At the same time, the fractional impact is diminished once the country's electricity generation rises to a certain level. This result matches that who investigated the relationship between financial integration and economic development. According to their findings, affluent nations experience the opposite impact compared to poor ones regarding the promotion of economic development by a worldwide financial implementation. Returning to the fixed effects, the results show that, while the influence size varies under different features derived, the better economic expansion allows states to invest in the renewable energy sector. Finally, the findings imply that independent of the numerical level, the output of green sources of the oil price and money.  5.1.3 Alternative measure of the installed capacity of renewable energy To match the earlier assumptions, people substitute the fossil fuel production per capita (eq. (1) ) with the ability to contribute bio energy to the total primary energy. This is done following the argument that states should progressively remove alternative energy. The new variable, which represents the percentage of energy produced from clean sources, is expressed in percentage (%). This component is rather intriguing because it shows the contributions made by various nations to diversify their power sources. The results of the cell division evaluations are presented. Its Hausman test indicates that the PMG estimator's outcomes are much more effective. Accordingly, the outcomes for sections (1), (3), and (4) are those that need to be debated (5). The presence of an extended battle capacity of renewable energy and its factors is supported by the fact that all integration correlations are negative and significant. Unusually, both in the short and long runs, the consequence of overall These results can be explained by the fact that, while financial globalization raises the supply of renewable energy, this boost appears to be less than because coal and oil continue to be the mainstay of the electricity system in the poor world.    6 Conclusion and policy implications The literature on the resource curse phenomena is extensive. Despite their wealth of natural resources need help growing their economies and finances. This research aims to reexamine the natural resource theory in the Chain during 1970–2015 concerning four variables: financial growth, financial decentralization, technological advancement, and economic policy uncertainty. To conduct thorough research and provide valuable results with essential policy consequences, the QARDL approach is seen as the best option. Testing for unit roots and the Zivot and Andrews (ZA) test is performed first to establish the sequence of integration and any structural breakdowns in the period data. These checks demonstrate that I (1) is the only possible integrated order across all of the variables。 Additionally, the ARDL technique displays the correlation between variables based on quantiles. The resource curse theory is supported by the significant statistically negative effect of NRR on FDV in China. China's financial development operations across the board have slowed due to the government's need for more clarity on economic strategy. While FDV is accelerated by the decentralization of finance and technological advancement in finance, the resource curse in China is mitigated. Additionally, the model's error correction variable was considerably -ve, demonstrating a solid return to the long-term connection between China's dependent and independent variables. QARDL suggests a relationship between NRR, FSD, INV, EUP and FDV, and the findings of the Wald and Granger Causality tests corroborate this. This study confirmed the theory of a resource curse in China. It made recommendations for policies according to the finding that China has a great potential to turn its mineral curse into an opportunity by adopting new measures to put its abundant resources better and rent to use in boosting domestic output. Proper resource management is essential right now. The government should promote additional value products rather than the sale of essential commodities and minerals to increase income. To further strengthen the financial framework at the state level, government agencies should encourage financing itself, co-financing, and inter-government transfers of funds as part of fiscal decentralization。 Furthermore, the government must improve the current financial framework after the favorable impact of technological innovation on FDV. As a result, a significant portion of resources should be dedicated to R&D to spur the development of new financial innovations. In addition, reliable contract enforcement is essential for preserving trade profits and monetary security. Similarly, the government should prioritize policy stability and implement specific preventative steps to address the elevated EPU level. Funding from outside sources including stock and accounts receivable must be arranged.
