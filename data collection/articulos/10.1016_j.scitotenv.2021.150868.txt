                  Land degradation has become one of the most critical environmental and socioeconomic issues in the world, particularly in Central Asia. Moreover, the realization of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) in Central Asia faces enormous challenges in achieving the global Sustainable Development Goal 15.3 (SDG 15.3). It is critical to monitor land degradation and assess its drivers in Central Asia. In this study, an Optimal Land Degradation Index (OLDI) was established as a new index for monitoring land degradation using a constrained optimization algorithm. The spatiotemporal characteristics of LDN were monitored in Central Asia. Further analysis explored the driving force of land degradation in different areas. The results showed that 7.22% and 15.33% of the total land area exhibited land improvement and land degradation, respectively. According to abrupt change analysis, mutation changes in the OLDI were observed in 2005, 2012 and 2015. At the subnational scale, most regions in Central Asia have not achieved the goal of LDN. The residual analysis highlighted the drivers of spatial differences in land degradation performance in Central Asia. Drought was the main driving force affecting land degradation by the compound effect of decreased precipitation and increased temperature on the Ustyurt Plateau, while 24.01% of the land degradation areas resulted from anthropogenic disturbances and were mainly distributed in the areas surrounding the Aral Sea. The results also indicated that 72.56% of the land improvement areas resulted from human activities and were mainly concentrated in the Balkhash Lake Delta and the Amudarya Delta. In Central Asia, the realization of SDG 15.3 by 2030 remains a severe challenge. Restoration measures should be prioritized in land degradation areas in Central Asia to implement the LDN initiative, especially around the Aral Sea.

Editor: Ouyang Wei Land degradation has become one of the most critical environmental and socioeconomic issues in the world, particularly in Central Asia. Moreover, the realization of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) in Central Asia faces enormous challenges in achieving the global Sustainable Development Goal 15.3 (SDG 15.3). It is critical to monitor land degradation and assess its drivers in Central Asia. In this study, an Optimal Land Degradation Index (OLDI) was established as a new index for monitoring land degradation using a constrained optimization algorithm. The spatiotemporal characteristics of LDN were monitored in Central Asia. Further analysis explored the driving force of land degradation in different areas. The results showed that 7.22% and 15.33% of the total land area exhibited land improvement and land degradation, respectively. According to abrupt change analysis, mutation changes in the OLDI were observed in 2005, 2012 and 2015. At the subnational scale, most regions in Central Asia have not achieved the goal of LDN. The residual analysis highlighted the drivers of spatial differences in land degradation performance in Central Asia. Drought was the main driving force affecting land degradation by the compound effect of decreased precipitation and increased temperature on the Ustyurt Plateau, while 24.01% of the land degradation areas resulted from anthropogenic disturbances and were mainly distributed in the areas surrounding the Aral Sea. The results also indicated that 72.56% of the land improvement areas resulted from human activities and were mainly concentrated in the Balkhash Lake Delta and the Amudarya Delta. In Central Asia, the realization of SDG 15.3 by 2030 remains a severe challenge. Restoration measures should be prioritized in land degradation areas in Central Asia to implement the LDN initiative, especially around the Aral Sea.

Sustainable Development Goal 15.3 (SDG 15.3) proposes to achieve a world with zero net land degradation, termed Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), by 2030. SDG 15.3 is an important target of the SDGs related to land and ecosystem preservation and biodiversity conservation (Prăvălie et al., 2017 ). Subsequently, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) released a special report on land degradation in 2019, which highlighted that the extent and incidence of poverty within populations were related to land degradation (Shukla et al., 2019a ). As the population increases, a malicious cycle between land degradation and poverty occurs in many regions, particularly in drylands (UNCCD, 2017 ). Central Asia is characterized by a fragile natural environment and is one of the largest dry regions in the world (Robinson, 2016 ). In recent decades, land degradation has become one of the major environmental problems in this area. The environmental disaster of the Aral Sea caused a series of ecological and environmental problems affecting local production and life (Robinson, 2016 ). Thus, land degradation monitoring in Central Asia is increasingly emerging as a global research hotspot. LDN realization in Central Asia represents the greatest challenge for achieving global SDG 15.3 (Zhang et al., 2017 ). Land degradation can be triggered by different drivers, such as human activities and climatic factors (UNCCD, 1994 ). Its drivers in Central Asia have shown regional features in recent decades (Chen et al., 2020 ). With the intensification of global climate change, extreme drought events occur frequently in this region, and an increased risk of land degradation has been observed (Guo et al., 2019b ). In addition, land degradation in Central Asia is related to different human activities, including agricultural expansion and water contradiction (Bekchanov et al., 2016 ), which have resulted in a substantial decrease in the area of the Aral Sea. Subsequently, the ecosystems have been severely damaged, leading to soil erosion and dust storms (Kumar et al., 2019 ; Micklin et al., 2016 ). Thus, assessing the drivers of land degradation is critical for planning strategies to achieve an LDN world. However, assessing land degradation in Central Asia following the evaluation methodology of SDG 15.3.1 proposed by the United Nations (UN) still faces some obstacles, which urgently need to be addressed. To date, the UN and UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) have proposed the use of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) to assess land degradation. Most efforts have monitored land degradation and assessed the ecological economics of land degradation by using NPP in previous studies (Giuliani et al., 2020 ; Kang et al., 2020 ; Li et al., 2020 ; Sutton et al., 2016 ; Tilahun et al., 2018 ). These studies can promote the development of land degradation research on regional and national scales. In the arid area of Central Asia, sparse vegetation is widely distributed, and the released NPP products currently have many missing values in the region. Sparse vegetation areas in Central Asia should not be ignored in land degradation studies because these regions have not converted into deserts without vegetation (Behnke and Mortimore, 2016 ; Robinson, 2016 ). Moreover, a single NPP index cannot accurately assess land degradation in this area. The main characteristics of land degradation should also consider soil status (Sommer et al., 2011 ). Thus, the establishment of an evaluation index system in Central Asia that is more reliable for monitoring land degradation and that can avoid the missing values issue for sparse vegetation using a single indicator is necessary. In addition, the weights for indicators for land degradation monitoring have been determined based on the analytical hierarchy process or the geometric mean values for a comprehensive assessment (Boudjemline and Semar, 2018 ; Capozzi et al., 2018 ; Wijitkosum, 2016 ; C. Yang et al., 2020 ). However, limited efforts have considered spatial differences in the determination of the weights for indicators. Land degradation is spatially heterogeneous for different vegetation types (Peng et al., 2020 ; Quaranta et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the methods of land degradation monitoring in drylands should be further improved. It is critical to establish a land degradation evaluation index system and consider spatial differences in the determination of the weights for each indicator in this research. Furthermore, few studies have focused on the LDN issue in recent years (Kiani-Harchegani and Sadeghi, 2020a ). The concept of LDN was first proposed for arid regions and suggested that land quality should be improved or stabilized to achieve zero net land degradation within specified spatial and temporal scales (Cowie et al., 2018 ). Realization of the LDN indicates the importance of tackling land degradation following its driving force to achieve SDG 15.3 (Stewart, 2015 ). Furthermore, most efforts have explored the relations between land degradation and climate change and have ignored the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances (Huang et al., 2015 ; Zeng and Yoon, 2009 ). Exploring the impacts of human activity on land degradation could contribute to preventing land degradation. Therefore, identified land degradation areas could play an active role in achieving LDN. Monitoring land degradation and assessing its drivers are necessary to provide decision-making references for decision-makers, especially in Central Asia. To meet the requirements mentioned above, we investigated land degradation and explored its drivers in Central Asia. Considering the spatial heterogeneity, an Optimal Land Degradation Index (OLDI) was obtained by filtering different weight combinations for the Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo and Temperature–Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) to evaluate land degradation in arid areas. The aims of the study were to (1) build a new dataset for evaluating land degradation in Central Asia from 2000 to 2019; (2) monitor the spatial characteristics of LDN and land degradation; and (3) assess its drivers from the perspectives of human activities and climate change. Through this research, understanding the spatiotemporal achievement of LDN could contribute to the realization of SDG 15.3 in Central Asia.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area Central Asia includes five countries: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan (Fig. 1  ). It is located in the middle of the Asian continent and features complex topography. The topographical map (Fig. 1 ) shows that the elevation is higher in the eastern mountainous ranges. The snow and permanent glaciers in the high mountains feed the Irtysh, Amudarya and Syrdarya Rivers, which are important water sources for the Aral Sea in Central Asia (Lee and Jung, 2018 ). Due to the landlocked location within the Eurasian continent, Central Asia has a typical temperate continental climate zone, with high solar radiation. Spatial variations in climatic factors form a gradient from the plains to the mountains (Chen et al., 2020 ). The average annual precipitation ranges from approximately 400 mm in the northern part to less than 100 mm in the southern part, whereas the annual average precipitation in the hilly and mountainous areas reaches up to approximately 800 mm (Hu et al., 2018 ). The average annual temperature varies from below 0 °C in the hilly and mountainous areas to above 18 °C in the southern deserts (Hu et al., 2014 ). Notably, most regions experience high evapotranspiration that exceeds than precipitation (Jiang et al., 2020 ). Central Asia is characterized by a fragile ecological environment, as is found in most temperate deserts worldwide (Jiang et al., 2017b ). Sparse vegetation, grasslands and croplands accounted for 46.09%, 24.26% and 20.43% of the study area, respectively. Moreover, 4.61% of the study area underwent land-use changes during the study period (Fig. 2  ). Most southern regions were dominated by sparse vegetation, whereas grasslands and forests were mainly distributed in hilly and mountainous regions (Chen et al., 2015 ). With the intensification of anthropogenic disturbances and climate dynamics, the land degradation risk in this region is increasing and has become one of the biggest challenges to achieving global LDN by 2030 (Jiang et al., 2019a ).  2.2 Data sources MODIS data, land-use data, soil classification data, and gridded climate data were selected in this study (Table 1  ). An OLDI was calculated by using the evaluation index system, which includes LST (Jiang et al., 2020 ), the NDVI, albedo (Ma et al., 2011 ) and the TVDI (Garcia et al., 2014 ). The TVDI was computed based on MOD11A2 and MOD13A1. The albedo, LST and NDVI were obtained from MCD43A3, MOD11A2 and MOD13A1, respectively. NPP was considered a constraint indicator to determine the weight of each indicator. The NPP data were obtained from MOD17A3HGF. These MODIS datasets were acquired from the NASA website (https://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/search/ ). Eight scenes (H21V3, H22V3, H23V3, H21V4, H22V4, H23V4, H22V5, and H23V5) cover all of Central Asia. All gridded data were aggregated to yearly data using the maximum composition method. In addition, the LST dataset was resampled to match the spatial resolution of the other gridded data. Land-use data were obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA) (http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/index.php ) with good quality control (Bontemps et al., 2013 ). To avoid the disturbance of land-use change, vegetation types were assumed to remain constant during the study period for further analysis. The other datasets included soil classification data, global gridded climate data and digital elevation data. Soil taxonomy units were developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) system at a 250 m resolution. The gridded meteorological data were acquired from the Climatic Research Unit Datasets with high accuracy (Mitchell and Jones, 2005 ). To distinguish mountains from plains, digital elevation data were used and developed by the NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM).  2.3 Methods 2.3.1 A constrained optimization algorithm The evaluation index system comprised the NDVI, LST, albedo and the TVDI, considering vegetation and soil status in this study. LST can be affected by plant coverage, and it is an important indicator for monitoring ecological processes and biogeochemical soil changes (Couradeau et al., 2016 ). The NDVI has been indirectly applied to monitor green biomass change and can be used as an indicator of vegetation status (Kundu and Dutta, 2011 ). Albedo has been used to monitor soil exposure in drylands (Mariano et al., 2018 ). The TVDI has been widely applied in soil humidity monitoring (Garcia et al., 2014 ). This indicator reflects the relation between the vegetation index and surface temperature by considering the conditions of the soil humidity and vegetation. This index proposed by Sandholt was named the temperature–vegetation dryness index (Sandholt et al., 2002 ). Thus, the result of land degradation assessment contained the above monitoring information, which is related to the land degradation process. If only vegetation indicators are selected, key soil information related to land degradation will be lost in the result of land degradation monitoring. According to the LST and NDVI feature space, the TVDI can be computed (Sandholt et al., 2002 ):(1) TVDI = T s obs  − T s w   T s d  − T s w       where Tsobs  represents the observed value. Tsw  and Tsd  demonstrate the minimum and maximum Ts values, respectively, for a specific NDVI interval. The OLDI is a new index for evaluating land degradation in arid areas. Based on the highest correlation coefficient between NPP and OLDI, the optimal weights for different indices were determined by using a constrained optimal weight algorithm and iterative calculation. Moreover, considering spatial heterogeneity for different vegetation types, each pixel was assigned the corresponding weight combination for indices. Thus, the new composite index for land degradation assessment was named an optimal land degradation index. The constrained optimization algorithm was calculated as follows (Guo et al., 2019a ):(2) f NPP OLD I t    = max E NPP − NPP ¯    × OLD I t  − OLD I t   ¯       δNPP × δOLD I t        (3) OLD I t  = α × NDVI + β × Albedo + γ × LST + λ × TVDI    (4) 0 < α < 1   0 < β < 1   0 < γ < 1   0 < λ < 1   α + β + γ + λ = 1        where OLDIt  represents the OLDI value at time t ; f (NPP,OLDIt ) is the determining function based on the highest correlation coefficient between NPP and OLDI; NPP ¯    and OLDI t  ¯    indicate the mean values of NPP and OLDIt , respectively; E  refers to the expectation; δNPP and δOLDIt  represent the standard deviation of NPP and OLDIt , respectively; and α, β, γ and λ refer to the weight of each indicator, respectively, between 0 and 1.  2.3.2 The trends earth method Defining 2000–2015 as the baseline period and 2016–2019 as the change period, land degradation was identified following the Trends Earth method issued by the UNCCD (Sims et al., 2017 ). This method considers information on land degradation, soil organic carbon and land-use change. The detailed method is provided online (http://trends.earth/docs/en/background/understanding_indicators15.html ).  2.3.3 Linear regression analysis Linear regression analysis has been widely applied to detect ecological and environmental changes in previous studies (Hu et al., 2020 ; Peng et al., 2021 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). In this study, the change trend in the detection indicators was quantified by using the slope coefficients from this method. The slope coefficients can be expressed (Seber and Lee, 2012 ):(5) Slope = n ∑ n i = 1   i × X i  − ∑ n i = 1   i × ∑ n i = 1   X i   n ∑ n i = 1   i 2  − ∑ n i = 1   i   2       where Slope  represents the slope coefficient of a linear fit. X i   is the index value of year i. n is the number of years ranging from 2000 to 2019. To test the significant change trend, an F-test was applied to acquire p-values in this research. The significance of the change trend was judged at a p-value < 0.05. The F statistical variable was calculated as follows (Seber and Lee, 2012 ):(6) F = U × n − 2  Q     (7) U = ∑ i = 1  n  y ^  i  − y ¯    2     (8) Q = ∑ i = 1  n  y i  − y ^  i    2     where U and Q represent the sum of the squares of the regression and error, respectively. y i   and y ^  i    are the observed value and regressed values, respectively. y   ¯    is the average value.  2.3.4 BFAST algorithm The Break For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) is an effective method that can be used to detect seasonal or annual changes with abrupt changes over a time period (Horion et al., 2019 ). The BFAST algorithm pioneered by Verbesselt included fitted piecewise linear models and a seasonal model (Verbesselt et al., 2010b ). This method can decompose the trend, and seasonal and remaining components can be decomposed within satellite image time series, coupled with the timing and magnitude of breakpoints. In this study, the BFAST algorithm was chosen to explore mutation years in the OLDI time series during the study period. Mutation years are years with dramatic changes in the OLDI from one year to the subsequent year over the study period. The algorithm was established by using the following equation (Verbesselt et al., 2010b ):(9) Y t  = T t  + S t  + e t   t = 1  ⋯ n     where St and Tt  indicate the seasonal component and change trend, respectively. Yt  represents the observed data at the tth time, and et  represents the remainder component. It is assumed that Tt  is a piecewise linear relationship with m breakpoints t1 ,⋯,tm  and is defined as t0  = 0; thus, Tt  is calculated as follows:(10) T t  = α i  + β i  t t i − 1  ∗  < t ≤ t i ∗       where i  = 1, …, m. αi  and βi  define the intercept and slope, respectively. The magnitude is acquired by calculating the difference between Tt  at t i−1 ∗  and ti  as follows:(11) Magnitude = α i − 1   − α i    + β i − 1   − β i    t     St  is a piecewise linear seasonal model based on seasonal harmonic variables. Let the seasonal breakpoints be given by t 1 # , ⋯, t p  # (t 0 #  = 0). Then, St  can be calculated as follows (Verbesselt et al., 2010a ):(12) S t  = ∑ k = 1  k  γ j , k   sin 2 πkt  f   + θ j , k   cos 2 πkt  f     t j − 1  #  < t ≤ t j #       where k and f refer to the number of harmonic terms and the frequency, respectively. γj, k  and θj, k  are the coefficients in a multiple linear harmonic regression model. The BFAST analysis was performed using the BFAST package in R. The BFAST01 function was applied to check for major breaks in the OLDI time series.  2.3.5 Residual analysis Residual analysis is one of the most popular approaches to distinguish land degradation triggered by anthropogenic disturbances from that resulting from climate change (Shukla et al., 2019b ). It has been applied in various regions of the world (Chen et al., 2020 ; Cui et al., 2018 ; Leroux et al., 2017 ). Residual analysis is based on the relationship between land degradation and climatic factors, hereinafter referred to as LCR (Land degradation-Climate Relationship), which is determined by a multiple regression model (Eq. (13) ). According to the LCR, we calculated the predicted OLDI. Then, the OLDI residuals were obtained for each pixel based on the differences between the observed and predicted OLDI values (Eq. (14) ) (Burrell et al., 2017 ). For each pixel, the residuals indicate that the distance of the observed OLDI value to the regression line constructed by the LCR and some of the observed OLDI value cannot be explained by climate change. The residuals were further analysed to distinguish the drivers of land degradation (Evans and Geerken, 2004 ; Herrmann et al., 2005 ). Based on the linear regression analysis and F-test, the change trend in the OLDI residuals was calculated to detect human-induced effects. If the OLDI residuals show nonsignificant change trends, the residuals are noise errors in the remote sensing data with no regular change, and land degradation is mainly caused by changes in climatic factors, whereas if the OLDI residuals represent significant change trends, land degradation cannot be explained by climatic factors and may have been triggered by anthropogenic disturbances (Herrmann et al., 2005 ). The residual analysis was established by using the following equation:(13) Pr edicted OLDI = α 0  + α 1  × Pr e + α 2  × Tem + ε    (14) OLDI residuals = Observed OLDI − Predicted OLDI    where Tem and Pre represent the annual temperature and precipitation, respectively; α0  represents the intercept; ε indicates the random error of the regression model; and α1  and α2  refer to regression coefficients of climatic factors.    3 Results 3.1 The yearly OLDI dataset produced for Central Asia Combined with the evaluation index system and a constrained optimal weight algorithm, the annual OLDI product was produced, as shown in Fig. 3  . Some sparse vegetation in the southern deserts was filled by OLDIs with high values. Thus, the land degradation assessment was advanced in this study, and it did not ignore the land degradation process in areas with sparse vegetation. The time series data showed that decreasing trends in OLDIs were observed in the two periods of 2000–2005 and 2015–2019, while some regions around the Aral Sea had an increase in OLDIs, especially in the two periods of 2005–2009 and 2012–2015. This phenomenon was caused by the drops in water level and water volume of the Aral Sea (Micklin et al., 2016 ; X. Yang et al., 2020 ). Regional governments should develop adaptation strategies to prevent land degradation and maintain ecosystem services in these areas (Kubiszewski et al., 2020 ). Based on the different weight combinations for indicators, the land degradation assessments of land use change were compared to test the effect of weight combinations. According to the Good Practice Guidance (GPG) report released by UNCCD, grassland-to-sparse vegetation and cropland-to-sparse vegetation conversions were all identified as types of land degradation. The results of the same weight and optimized weight combinations were investigated for these land conversions (Fig. S1, Supplementary material). We found that the result of the optimized weight combination was significantly better than the result of the same weight combination. The increasing trends in the OLDI were stronger than those in the result of the same weight combination for indicators. Based on the OLDI dataset, the high R2  values of 0.468 and 0.627 from linear regression analysis were detected for the conversions of grassland-to-sparse vegetation and cropland-to-sparse vegetation, respectively. Thus, compared with the same weight combination, the constrained optimization algorithm used in the OLDI was more sensitive for monitoring land degradation and was reliable for identifying weight combinations for land degradation assessment.  3.2 The OLDI compared with the NPP from the MODIS dataset The OLDI dataset produced in this study and the NPP obtained from MOD17A3HGF are compared in Fig. 4  . We found that some missing values in areas with sparse vegetation were observed in the NPP dataset (Fig. 4 a and b). However, these regions were prone to land degradation and cannot be ignored in land degradation assessments in Central Asia, especially around the Aral Sea. The spatial distributions of the annual average NPPs and OLDIs were calculated, as displayed in Fig. 4 a and c, respectively. The results showed that low average NPPs occurred in western Central Asia, while high average NPPs were identified in the Eastern Mountains and Kazakhskiy Melkosopochnik. In contrast, the opposite distribution phenomenon of the annual average OLDIs was identified because a higher value of OLDI represents low land quality. Notably, the range of the annual average values in the OLDI was between 0 and 0.9 in Central Asia and was higher than that of NPP (0–0.55 kgC/m2 /year). Thus, the spatial distribution of the annual average OLDI values displayed better spatial heterogeneity than that of NPP values. The change trends of NPP and OLDI were computed, as shown in Fig. 4 b and d, respectively. Eastern Central Asia experienced an upward tendency in NPP, while the western part showed a downward trend. For the OLDI, the change trend showed a low degree of spatial aggregation. A significant increasing trend (0.006/a) was detected in the regions surrounding the Aral Sea. Overall, the OLDI change trend showed obvious spatial differences in Central Asia. Although it is difficult to verify a composite index, an indirect verification of the OLDI was conducted according to the GPG report. In this report, forest-to-cropland, forest-to-grassland, and wetland-to-grassland conversions were all identified as types of land degradation (Sims et al., 2017 ). Comparing the trends of NPP and the OLDI, the result (Fig. 5  ) showed that the improved OLDI was significantly better than the NPP recommended by the UN, especially in the regions where wetlands were degraded into natural vegetation. Contrary to the facts, the NPP trend indicated a positive land improvement in these regions, while the OLDI accurately showed significant land degradation. In addition, compared with the NPP trend, the OLDI was more sensitive to the land degradation process of forest-to-grassland. Overall, its performance in monitoring land degradation was significantly better and is reliable in Central Asia. To highlight the trend comparison of the NPP and OLDI in the specific regions, the three regions (Regions A, B and C) with land use changes were selected in Central Asia, as shown in Fig. S2. High conversions from forest to croplands, wetlands to grasslands and forest to grasslands were observed in regions A, B and C, respectively. The results indicated that forest transformed into croplands and grasslands in regions A and B, respectively, and the OLDI accurately showed more significant land degradation than the NPP. In region C, wetlands were degraded into grassland, and serious land degradation was identified by using the OLDI. However, the NPP trend showed that land degradation was not obvious in region C. Thus, the OLDI was more sensitive to the land degradation process and was selected for the land degradation assessment in this study.  3.3 Mutation year detection in the OLDI To detect years with abrupt changes in the OLDI, the BFAST method was applied for each pixel. Fig. 6 a  shows the spatial distribution of mutation changes. We found that years with abrupt OLDI changes presented spatial consistency. Mutation changes in approximately 2006 were detected in most regions of Central Asia, whereas most areas with abrupt changes from 2012 to 2018 were distributed in the Aral Sea region. The percentages of abrupt change years for different states and vegetation types are shown in Fig. 6 b. The percentages of abrupt change years for different vegetation types had certain differences. Croplands, grasslands and land-use change areas had higher percentages of abrupt change years in 2005 and 2012, followed by forests and wetlands. In contrast, higher percentages of abrupt change years in 2012 and 2015 were observed in areas with sparse vegetation. Regarding the different countries, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan had higher percentages of abrupt change years in 2005 and 2012, followed by Tajikistan, whereas Uzbekistan had a higher proportion of abrupt change years in 2012 and 2015. Moreover, mutation changes in approximately 2012 were detected in most regions of Turkmenistan. In general, 2005, 2012 and 2015 were the years with major changes in Central Asia.  3.4 Spatiotemporal assessment of vegetation degradation and land degradation The NPP and OLDI were selected as valid indicators of vegetation degradation and land degradation assessment, respectively. The vegetation degradation and land degradation are compared in Fig. 7  . Based on the linear regression analysis and F-test, vegetation degradation and improvement were identified in Central Asia (Fig. 7 a). Vegetation improvement was relatively concentrated in eastern Kazakhstan, and vegetation degradation was mainly distributed in the Ustyurt Plateau (Fig. 7 a). Vegetation dynamics presented clustering phenomena in space. In contrast, most land degradation occurred in western Central Asia and areas surrounding the Aral Sea, while the land improvement areas were scattered in Central Asia. Land degradation around the Aral Sea was serious and cannot be ignored (Fig. 7 b). We found that vegetation degradation was a driving force of land degradation, and vegetation degradation could not be used as a replacement for a land degradation assessment. The main features of land degradation should also be related to soil status. Thus, the OLDI was more reliable for land degradation monitoring in this study. At the subnational scale, the achievement of zero net land degradation was calculated in different regions, as shown in Fig. 8 a . The land improvement area in nine subnational regions was larger than the land degradation area, while the areas of land degradation in the other regions were higher than the areas of land improvement. The realization of SDG 15.3 in Central Asia by 2030 remains a severe challenge. Therefore, the prevention and control of land degradation in Central Asia is critical for achieving the global zero net land degradation target. The percentages of land degradation classes in different countries are displayed in Fig. 8 b. In Central Asia, 15.33% of the total land area exhibited land degradation, whereas 7.22% of the total land area was categorized as land improvement. In all countries, the percentage of land degradation area exceeded that of land improvement. Among them, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan had the highest proportions of land degradation at 14.98%, 15.03%, and 23.60%, respectively. The highest proportions of land improvement were identified in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan at 8.39% and 8.97%, respectively, while the proportions of stable land in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan accounted for 88.27% and 87.80%, respectively, which were higher than those in the other Central Asian countries. Regarding different vegetation types, the percentages of land degradation classes varied and are shown in Fig. 8 b. Higher percentages of land degradation were found for sparse vegetation (13.96%) and grasslands (12.76%) than for the other vegetation types, followed by that of wetlands (12.47%). In contrast, the proportions of land improvement of wetlands and forests were 16.39% and 9.23%, respectively, greater than those of other vegetation types. The highest percentage of stable area was identified for grasslands. For the vegetation change area, the proportions of land degradation and land improvement were 59.85% and 37.33%, respectively, higher than those of the other vegetation types. Thus, the differences in the land degradation process between the vegetation change area and constant vegetation area were obvious.  3.5 Assessing the drivers of land degradation The spatial distribution of the annual change trend in precipitation and temperature was calculated, as shown in Fig. 9 a and b , respectively. Precipitation showed spatial heterogeneity, with a significant upward tendency observed on the Ustyurt Plateau (Fig. 9 a). Temperature presented a nonsignificant change trend in most regions, with a slight increasing trend found in southwestern Central Asia and a slight decreasing trend found in northern Kazakhstan (Fig. 9 b). According to the change trend analysis of the OLDI residuals (Fig. 9 c), an increasing trend (0.004/a) in the OLDI residuals was revealed in the areas surrounding the Aral Sea, while a decreasing trend in the OLDI residuals was detected in the Amudarya Delta. The F-test of the OLDI residual change trend was performed to categorize residual significance (p-value ≤ 0.05) and nonsignificance (p-value > 0.05). Then, the change trends in the OLDI and significant changes in the OLDI residual were overlaid for further analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 9 d. The drivers of land degradation from anthropogenic disturbances and climate dynamics were distinguished for land degradation. The dark orange and dark blue shading are mainly scattered in the areas surrounding the Aral Sea and Balkhash Lake. The OLDI residuals in these areas presented a significant change tendency, and land degradation and improvement may have been triggered by anthropogenic disturbances. Light orange and light blue shading were predominantly distributed on the Ustyurt Plateau and Kazakhskiy Melkosopochnik. The OLDI residuals in these regions showed nonsignificant change trends, and land degradation and improvement could be caused by climatic factors. The land degradation areas driven by human activities and climate change accounted for 24.01% and 75.99% of the pixels, respectively. In contrast, the land improvement regions accounted for 72.56% and 27.44% of the pixels with the impacts of human activities and climate change, respectively. Generally, climate change was the major driving force affecting land degradation, while anthropogenic activities were the main driver of land improvement in Central Asia.   4 Discussion 4.1 The drivers of land degradation Land degradation is typically caused by climate change and human activities (D'Odorico et al., 2013 ). In Central Asia, spatial differences in land degradation performance were caused by different drivers. On the Ustyurt Plateau, drought was the major driving force that affected land degradation by the compound effect of decreased precipitation and increased temperature (Fig. 9 ). We found that the Ustyurt Plateau has experienced land degradation with nonsignificant changes in the OLDI residuals; that is, land degradation was mostly caused by climate dynamics (Fig. 9 ). The ecological water demand of natural plants is mainly satisfied by precipitation in this region. Moreover, increasing temperature can increase surface evaporation, which severely restricts the growth of natural plants, especially in areas with low vegetation coverage (Jiang et al., 2017a ). Accordingly, a higher percentage of land degradation areas driven by climate change was observed in Central Asia. Similarly, previous studies reported that climate change was a main driver explaining the decreasing trend in NPP in this region (Chen et al., 2019 ; Chen et al., 2020 ). In addition, anthropogenic disturbances were a critical driver affecting land degradation, accounting for 24.01% of the land degradation areas, particularly around the Aral Sea. As one of the world's largest inland lakes, the Aral Sea provides important ecosystem functions and has rich biodiversity (Micklin et al., 2016 ). However, the shrinkage of the Aral Sea caused by large-scale agricultural expansion in the upstream regions has become a shocking global disaster (Jiang et al., 2020 ). Increasing agricultural water consumption caused the water level of the Aral Sea to drop by 7.77 m from 2000 to 2018 (Fig. S3, Supplementary material). Subsequently, some regions around the Aral Sea become more sensitive to land degradation than other areas (Jiang et al., 2019a ). Some lands around the Aral Sea were severely degraded (Fig. 7 ). We obtained the high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth software for two specific regions from 2000 to 2019 (Regions A and B) (Fig. S3, Supplementary material). Serious vegetation degradation was identified with decreased soil moisture in Region A. In Region B, soil salinization was observed after the shrinkage of the Aral Sea. Therefore, land degradation in the areas surrounding the Aral Sea was related to the significant anthropogenic disturbances in the upstream regions (Micklin et al., 2016 ). In the Atyrau region of western Kazakhstan, land degradation in some regions was caused by anthropogenic disturbances (Fig. 9 d). Land degradation was associated with oil and gas extraction and soil erosion due to the abandonment of cultivated land in these regions (Egamberdieva and Öztürk, 2018 ; Robinson, 2016 ). Local governments should develop policies to prevent further land degradation and maintain ecosystem service functions in land degradation areas. Regarding land improvement, 72.56% of the land improvement areas resulted from anthropogenic disturbances and were mainly distributed in the Amudarya Delta and the Balkhash Lake Delta. In the Amudarya Delta, some sparse vegetation and grasslands were cultivated into croplands, and more water was delivered from the Amudarya River (Zonn et al., 2018 ). Although the expansion of croplands resulted in increasing vegetation coverage, increased agricultural water could exacerbate ecological water shortages in the downstream area, resulting in severe land degradation around the Aral Sea (Jiang et al., 2019b ). In the Balkhash Lake Delta, the average annual discharge of runoff in the delta has increased by 26.5% in the last two decades, leading to many positive impacts on fragile ecosystems around Balkhash Lake (Duan et al., 2020 ). Therefore, a significant change trend of the OLDI residuals was observed around Balkhash Lake (Fig. 9 ). In addition, 27.44% of the land improvement areas were mainly driven by increased precipitation and were spatially scattered in Kazakhskiy Melkosopochnik. Grassland improved significantly with increased precipitation (Chen et al., 2015 ). In general, the drivers of land degradation and improvement showed obvious spatial differences. Previous studies indicated that climate change was forced by anthropogenic activities over the previous century, especially regarding the CO2  fertilization effect and land use change (Burrell et al., 2020 ; Donohue et al., 2013 ; Song et al., 2018 ). Globally, anthropogenic climate change (ACC) has leaded to significant land degradation in an area of 0.75 million km2 , which was mainly concentrated in Australia and Eastern Asia (Burrell et al., 2020 ). Climate change caused by anthropogenic activities over the previous century was not considered in this study. Future land degradation studies will further quantify the role of ACC by model simulations, including the CO2  fertilization effect and land use in Central Asia.  4.2 The impacts of land degradation The environmental disaster of the Aral Sea has almost destroyed the local ecosystems. Serious land degradation can influence human health around the Aral Sea (Micklin et al., 2016 ). Toxic pollutants, including pesticides, were deposited in the Aral Sea. As the Aral Sea continues to shrink, the soil at the bottom is exposed to air, releasing these chemical contaminants, which have negative impacts on the health of humans, including hepatitis, respiratory diseases and rising infant mortality rates (Jiang et al., 2020 ). Moreover, salt transport and sand storms carrying toxic pollutants often occur in the downstream reaches, destroying agriculture and hindering animal husbandry around the Aral Sea (Whish-Wilson, 2017 ). Recently, a major salt-laden sandstorm lasted three days, and the impacted area extended to Bukhara on May 26, 2018. Moreover, land degradation can increase food insecurity and threaten the livelihoods of people (Micklin et al., 2016 ). In Central Asia, all states are facing food security issues. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan can meet approximately 30% of the domestic food demand, whereas Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan meet approximately 50% of the domestic food demand (FAO, 2018 ). In particular, the downstream regions of the Aral Sea basin are especially degraded and are experiencing severe food insecurity. The farmers planted cotton in degraded croplands, suffering a loss of approximately 95 USD per hectare (Aw-Hassan et al., 2016 ). Thus, land degradation can affect the health of local humans and food security in Central Asia. SDG 15.3 specifically proposed achieving global LDN status by 2030 (Cowie et al., 2018 ). To date, most regions in Central Asia have not achieved the goal of LDN (Fig. 8 ). Achieving SDG 15.3 in Central Asia by 2030 remains a severe challenge, and this difficulty will influence the realization of the global SDG 15.3. The aim of LDN requires that the land quality remain stable or improve to achieve zero net land degradation (Kiani-Harchegani and Sadeghi, 2020b ). To achieve this goal, LDN activities should avoid, reduce and reverse land degradation. That is, areas with stable land should avoid land degradation and remain in the current state, while areas with land degradation should be reduced or restored by sustainable land management practices (Prăvălie et al., 2017 ; Prăvălie et al., 2020 ). Thus, the areas of land degradation identified in this study can be the main objectives of restoration plans, providing a decision-making reference for the government to implement the LDN initiative, especially in the Aral Sea basin.   5 Conclusions In this study, an OLDI was built as a new dataset for evaluating land degradation based on a constrained optimal weight algorithm in Central Asia. The spatiotemporal characteristics of land degradation and LDN were monitored following the Trends Earth method. Afterward, combined with temperature and precipitation data, the drivers of land degradation were detected in Central Asia. The main results are as follows:(1) Compared with NPP data from MOD17A3HGF, the OLDI was more sensitive to the land degradation process and was selected for the land degradation assessment in Central Asia. A downward trend in the OLDI was identified in most of Central Asia, while an upward tendency was observed on the Ustyurt Plateau. Notably, a significant increasing trend (0.006/a) was detected in the regions surrounding the Aral Sea. Based on abrupt change analysis, mutation changes in the OLDI were observed in 2005, 2012 and 2015. The OLDI dataset was established in this study, and it can be conducive to LDN assessment in Central Asia.  (2) In Central Asia, 15.33% of the total land area exhibited land degradation, whereas 7.22% of the total land area was categorized as land improvement. Among the different vegetation types, higher percentages of land degradation were found for areas with sparse vegetation (13.96%) and grasslands (12.76%). At the subnational scale, most regions in Central Asia have not achieved the goal of LDN. The realization of SDG 15.3 in Central Asia by 2030 remains a severe challenge. Land degradation prevention and control in Central Asia is critical to achieving the global LDN target.  (3) Land degradation performance spatial differences were caused by different drivers. Drought was the main driving force affecting land degradation by the compound effect of decreased precipitation and increased temperature on the Ustyurt Plateau. In addition, 24.01% of the land degradation areas resulted from anthropogenic disturbances and were mainly distributed around the Aral Sea. The Aral Sea area shrank by 73.28% in the last two decades. Subsequently, land around the Aral Sea became severely degraded.  (4) Regarding land improvement, 72.56% of the land improvement areas resulted from human activities and were mainly clustered in the Amudarya Delta and the Balkhash Lake Delta. In the Amudarya Delta, cropland expansion could be beneficial for increasing vegetation greenness. However, increased agricultural water exacerbated ecological water shortages in the downstream regions. In the Balkhash Lake Delta, an increase in annual average runoff discharge to the lower reaches resulted in land improvement around Balkhash Lake. Additionally, 27.44% of the land improvement areas were mostly driven by increased precipitation and were spatially scattered in Kazakhskiy Melkosopochnik.    Land degradation can affect the health of local humans and food security in Central Asia. The identified areas of land degradation in this research should be the main objectives of restoration plans, providing a decision-making reference for the government to implement SDG 15.3, especially around the Aral Sea. Furthermore, land degradation is the result of the combined effects of many driving factors. Root zone storage capacity is an important factor for the land transitions. In future research, we will consider root zone storage capacity to gain insight into the land degradation process in Central Asia.
