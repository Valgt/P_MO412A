                  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to achieve a more inclusive, resilient, safe and sustainable society. Policy makers, together with entrepreneurs and citizens, are called to a great challenge to optimize land use. This work, through a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), aims at comparing the sustainability of 103 Italian cities through the evaluation of 45 SDGs’ indicators, ranking cities on the base of their performance. Results show strong disparities across Italy with three northern cities at the top of the ranking and many southern cities at the bottom. The analysis then creates a framework based on experts’ view composed of 21 criteria that would facilitate the development of a sustainability plan. A hybrid methodology based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the 10-point scale is used to rank among the criteria. Selected experts underlined how sustainable policy and green investment are enabling factors of sustainable cities, but political stability and streamlined public spending are also essential to achieve this goal. The analysis offers insights for different categories of stakeholders and invites to measure and monitor the progress of cities towards SDGs proposing eight directions (policy, economy, operations, environment, organization, staff, society and human).

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to achieve a more inclusive, resilient, safe and sustainable society. Policy makers, together with entrepreneurs and citizens, are called to a great challenge to optimize land use. This work, through a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), aims at comparing the sustainability of 103 Italian cities through the evaluation of 45 SDGs’ indicators, ranking cities on the base of their performance. Results show strong disparities across Italy with three northern cities at the top of the ranking and many southern cities at the bottom. The analysis then creates a framework based on experts’ view composed of 21 criteria that would facilitate the development of a sustainability plan. A hybrid methodology based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the 10-point scale is used to rank among the criteria. Selected experts underlined how sustainable policy and green investment are enabling factors of sustainable cities, but political stability and streamlined public spending are also essential to achieve this goal. The analysis offers insights for different categories of stakeholders and invites to measure and monitor the progress of cities towards SDGs proposing eight directions (policy, economy, operations, environment, organization, staff, society and human).

It aims to ensure that cities are inclusive, green, safe and sustainably managed (Allam and Jones, 2021 ). It is now a shared thought that local territories, whether cities, provinces or regions, are fundamental in the achievement of the SDGs (Yigitcanlar, 2022; Yigitcanlar and Kamruzzaman, 2018 ). To meet the needs and adapt to the characteristics of individual signatory countries, they were immediately asked to adopt a National Strategy for Sustainable Development (Mallick et al., 2021 ) aiming to optimize the right mix between land use and urban sustainability (Iannillo and Fasolino, 2021 ). The Adoption of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs targets and related indicators has further pushed towards the sustainable transition (Allen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018 ). Moreover, given the heterogeneity of territories, it is essential that individual regions, and with them their provinces and cities, define their own sustainable agenda to be implemented and monitored over time (Alvarez-Risco et al., 2020; D’Amico et al., 2021b ). Urban transformation should be a multi-scalar process across sectors and requires the contribution of appropriate city governance, sustainability-focused urban planning, technological innovations, building infrastructure and fostering a change in social behavior (Ioppolo et al., 2012; Crane et al., 2021 ). In this perspective, it is very useful for urban design of cities to provide mental comfort to inhabitants in order to encourage the development of social activities (Denis et al., 2021 ). Some authors point out that high-density urban development causes local health problems (Zhao and Li, 2017 ) highlighting how the variable density of the population is critical for achieving the goals of sustainable development. Cities play a fundamental role in the journey towards sustainable development, and it is necessary to analyze all their dimensions and facets, priorities and criticalities, in order to define and promote strategies to make them more sustainable (Villegas Flores et al., 2021; Yigitcanlar and Kamruzzaman, 2018 ). The development of cities has been a double-edged sword: if, on the one hand, it contributed to the achievement of important goals, on the other hand, it has given rise to new challenges. For example, although the urban context can boast the production of 80 % of the world’s Gross Domestic Product, it should be highlighted that from the same area comes about 70 % of the world’s CO2  emissions and the consumption of about 70 % of the world’s energy (The World Bank, 2020 ). In addition, extreme poverty, unemployment and socio-economic inequality, unsustainable consumption and production patterns, and the resulting climate change accompanied by environmental degradation, are recurrent realities in urban centers (D’Amico et al., 2021a, 2020 ). This does not prevent them from hosting most global business and informal enterprises, providing developed markets for industry and employment, and promoting technological innovation. The elements of smart governance, such as collaboration, communication and accountability, participation, partnership and transparency, are positively related to the quality of life in the perception of citizens (De Guimarães et al., 2020 ). The quality of life in the urban environment can be improved by following SDGs’ path to more balanced and equitable development. The idea embedded in the SDGs envisions a more sustainable perspective of urban development, providing equal opportunities for all citizens, an active participant in the sustainable development challenge (Dwivedi et al., 2021; Kamble and Bahadure, 2021 ). Promoting urban resilience is also an objective of companies and the main strategies, as reflected in their sustainability reports, are biodiversity, prevention and governance (Acuti et al., 2020 ), based also on a lean and cleaner production (Taddeo et al., 2019 ). In particular, the relevance of providing a new perspective on urban development and policy research for countries around the world is emphasized (Jia et al., 2020; Kassouri and Okunlola, 2022 ). Furthermore, the literature places a great deal of emphasis also on rankings – the goal being to raise awareness and accountability among territories toward achieving SDGs. Analyzes show that a city’s ranking is highly dependent on the method and indicators chosen and that the methods used so far have the limitation of not considering interconnections (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ). These analyzes can be conducted not only to a global level (Miola and Schiltz, 2019 ), but also at the local level (Xu et al., 2020 ). Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies are issues that can no longer be postponed in order to live in healthy and sustainable cities and reduce spatial inequalities (Giles-Corti et al., 2020 ). Comparing cities in order to classify them is a relevant topic in the literature (Jingxin et al., 2022 ). Some works focused on European capital cities (Akande et al., 2019 ), others aimed to see how European countries move towards the SDGs (Hametner and Kostetckaia, 2020 ). The results show that cities direct expenses to sustainability issues but their environmental policies are ineffective (De Matteis et al., 2021 ); consequently, the need to develop smart city programs that lead to sustainable results is emphasized (Yigitcanlar and Kamruzzaman, 2018 ). Thus, the issue of sustainability is fundamental to optimizing land use (Bibri, 2022 ), and ranking between different land areas is useful for measuring individual performance and providing policy implications (D’Adamo et al., 2022, 2021 ). The aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework through which the different available data on sustainability can be applied to urban contexts. A MCDA is used to identify the performance of different cities in the same country (Italy) in order to highlight the best performing ones in terms of sustainable development. Ranking of cities allows to highlight critical issues or models to be exported and is useful as an element of monitoring over time. However, in order to expand the analysis from the Italian context to the global context, a further framework oriented towards defining a sustainability plan has been created. For this purpose, a hybrid methodology obtained by considering the results of the AHP and 10-point scale, both obtained from experts’ assessments is used. The policy indications are oriented towards suggesting possible strategies to be implemented to make cities more sustainable. Consequently, we can identify two research objectives (RO):• RO1: The assessment of the sustainability performance of Italian cities.  • RO2: The analysis of a sustainable development plan for Italian cities.    The paper is organized as follows: after this introduction, a literature analysis is proposed in Section 2 . The methodology and the data set utilized is presented in Section 3  and the obtained results are discussed in Section 4 . Finally, policy implications are proposed in Section 5 , while Section 6  concludes the paper.  2 Literature review Sustainable development of cities is an increasingly crucial topic in the literature. Some authors have stressed the need for a systems approach to recognize co-benefits and synergies, to guide the management of inevitable trade-offs in order to identify priorities (Bai et al., 2016 ). The topic is not new and has been underestimated over time, causing environmental impacts that in many parts of the planet are visible today. An interesting perspective point highlighted "Sustainable Cities or Cities that Contribute to Sustainable Development?" in which there was a final message urging national governments and city and municipal authorities to put sustainability at the center of their agenda (Satterthwaite, 1997 ). Accordingly, the goal is to transform urban areas into prosperous, livable and sustainable settlements (Yigitcanlar et al., 2019 ), in which stakeholders’ engagement plays a key role in creating sustainable communities that go beyond classic perimeters (D’Adamo and Sassanelli, 2022 ). An inevitable choice since cities are complex socioecological systems that are also determined by human interactions. In this context, it is necessary to establish a relationship between physical environment and human needs (González-Méndez et al., 2021 ). The literature has proposed the need to identify aggregate indicators that incorporate the different contributions associated with each SDG (Giannetti et al., 2020 ). Some authors have introduced a 5SEnSU model, while others have proposed a sustainable well-being index (Costanza et al., 2016 ). It has been shown how GDP per capita cannot capture all aspects of economic sustainability (D’Adamo et al., 2022 ). In addition, the literature also places much emphasis on rankings, with the goal of increasing cities' awareness and accountability toward achieving the SDGs (Cheng et al., 2022; García López et al., 2021 ). Another important aspect is that of urban competitiveness, which can be achieved not only with good economic performance, but also with satisfactory social and environmental development (Jiang and Shen, 2010 ). However, it emerges that the relationship between government and city competitiveness is not yet fully defined (Nasi et al., 2022 ). In addition, the data set you have and its relationship to the final result is important (Vinyals-Mirabent, 2019 ). Some authors point out that greater emphasis on the factors of a knowledge-based economy lead to a growth in the country's competitiveness, which can also improve sustainability. The approach used is based on multi-criteria analysis (Širá et al., 2020 ). The same methodology is proposed to calculate the comparison between Italian regions using all SDGs available in the data (D’Adamo et al., 2021 ). Italy falls within the Mediterranean basin, and several authors have highlighted efforts to achieve SDG objectives in that area (Ozarisoy and Altan, 2022, 2021 ). Looking at the Europe Sustainable Development Report 2020, based on 230 indicators, Italy ranked in respectively 23rd and 26th position among European and OECD countries as regards sustainability levels, where no SDGs have been completely achieved (SDSN and IEEP, 2020 ). The results of the analysis, proposed by Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (2020) , show that at local level the best results are obtained for goals 1 (no poverty), 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 17 (partnership for the goals). For example, 54 cities reach the best results and only five reach worst results (Catania, Crotone, Napoli, Palermo and Trapani) in SDG1; in SDG 6, where 29 cities reach the best results and only three reach worst results (Catania, Pistoia and Treviso) and in SDG 17, where none city is in a critical situation. From a geographical point of view, the northern regions of Italy seem more sensible to the achievement of sustainable targets respect to the regions located in the Center and in the South ( Fig. 1 ). More than 70 % of the SDGs indicators in the northern regions met at least 50 % of the targets, while in the southern regions more than 50 % of the SDGs indicators were below 50 % of the targets, falling to about 40 % in the central regions. Going into the details of the single city it is possible to note that only 8 cities (Milano, Novara, Pavia, Vercelli, Siena, Mantova, Trento and Udine) reach a number of SDG (≥ 4) with an high level of target achievement whereas 9 cities (Catania, Palermo, Napoli, Crotone, Caltanissetta, Siracusa, Reggio Calabria and Potenza) assume a number of SDG (≥ 4) with very low results. Notice again that cities in the first cluster are located in the North of Italy (with the exception of Siena) and the city in the second cluster are all located in the South (with the exception of Pistoia).  3 Materials and methods This paper consists of two distinct methodologies that are used to address two distinct research objectives RO1 and RO2. The research framework is proposed in  Fig. 2 . Multi-criteria decision analysis, 10-point scale and AHP are proposed in this work. 3.1 Multi-criteria decision analysis The present work is based on MCDA, a method widely used in the literature since it combines simplicity with reliability. MCDA falls under Operations Research and explicitly evaluates multiple conflicting criteria within a decision-making process, in which alternative solutions to solve a problem are compared (Han et al., 2018 ). The strength of this methodology consists in the identification of appropriate criteria, which must be measurable in order to compare the different alternatives (Nesticò et al., 2020; Sironen et al., 2020 ). This analysis determines a synthetic result in which different information, which may also be conflicting, is aggregated. This method can be used to compare countries where the goal is to assess sustainability (D’Adamo et al., 2021; Phillis et al., 2021 ). For the purpose of this work, we use and update the data available on the site https://sdg-portal.it/it  which, aggregates the different indicators broken down by city. Indicators with an incomplete geographical coverage (i.e. missing data for various cities, Pesaro PE - Barletta Andria Trani BT), were discarded. In addition, cities characterized by a severe data gap (Fermo and Carbonia) were also not included in the sample. In this way, starting from a sample of 107 cities, the aggregation of data concerned 103 Italian cities and for each city 45 indicators were considered (see  Table 1  for the full list of indicators). Whenever possible, missing data were estimated through additional network searches. Once all inputs were aggregated and updated, equal to 4635 (103 cities and 45 indicators), a normalization process was carried out. As a result, for each indicator, the maximum and minimum values associated with the various cities were identified and given a value of 1 and 0, respectively. The next step was to assign an intermediate value calculated on the basis of the maximum and minimum values for the remaining cities. The overall sustainability indicator was obtained through the product of the values and weights of the criteria. This step turns out to be complex. In fact, the criteria chosen for the indicator should have their own homogeneity (in this case demonstrated by their presence within the SDGs), and calculating both weight and value can be a difficult exercise. All normalized values are reported in Appendix 1  in order to allow replication of obtained results. A detailed description of each indicator is also reported in the same database. Regarding the distribution of weights, this work uses an equal weighting method in accordance with the literature. A review on this topic showed that equal weighting methods are used in almost half of the papers, and about one-fifth use both adopted participatory-based methods (e.g., public opinion and analytic hierarchy process) and adopted statistical-based methods (e.g., principal component analysis and regression analysis) - (Gan et al., 2017 ). Other authors opted to use the same weights for all indicators to assess the impact on sustainable development (Roszkowska and Filipowicz-Chomko, 2020 ). To minimize individual judgments and biases, it was considered appropriate to assign the same relevance to each indicator. A shortcoming of this approach is that it disregards possible interdependencies among indicators, however it follows the logic that an indicator cannot be considered more relevant than the others. The basic MCDA output will be supplemented by other analyzes to provide further implications. The cities will be decomposed into groups according to the output of the MCDA. Below, the focus will be on the performance of the three most relevant cities and the three least relevant cities by specifically evaluating all indicators considered in this work. The next analysis will be at the SDG level where we will see all cities as they rank according to SDG groups. Since differences in ranking may depend on the level of indicator concentration, this parameter will be evaluated for all indicators. Finally, the output of MCDA is decomposed according to SDG groups for both geographic area and population density.  3.2 A hybrid methodology based on 10-point scale and Analytic Hierarchy Process The subsequent step in the work was to understand how cities can move forward. To this end, a framework was constructed based on a number of criteria that were identified in order to develop a sustainability plan ( Table 2 ). The goal of the work is to not only measure performance for individual cities but also to identify how this performance can improve. The number of indicators for which data is available is small compared to that of the SDGs, and for this reason the proposals to be implemented should cover a wider range. Therefore, the idea is to identify criteria that are able to improve the performance of the previously proposed indicators but also to include other aspects of sustainability not covered by these indicators. The framework was composed of 21 criteria according to literature and validated by experts.1  1 A small number of the expert panel was initially contacted to assess whether or not the criteria selected in accordance with the literature are comprehensive, and potential additional indicators to add or replace were then identified.   The criteria were compared through two different methodologies: AHP (Saaty, 2008 ) and 10-point scale based on Likert Scale analysis (Dawes, 2008 ). In order to make all criteria comparable, it was necessary in the AHP method to divide them into subgroups. In particular, seven categories were identified (policy, staff, organization, economy, society, environment and operations) and for each an equal number of criteria (three) was chosen so as not to privilege any of them. The difference between the two methods is that the former evaluates pairwise comparisons between criteria, while the latter evaluates criteria individually. In addition, the judgments are trustworthy if the consistency ratio is lower than 0.10 within AHP method. The methodological novelty introduced in this work was to use a hybrid approach in which a value equal to the weighted average between the two values obtained from the AHP and 10-point scale methodology was identified, with normalized values for the latter in order to make the comparison homogeneous. The assignment of values had been made through a panel of 20 experts - a number considered suitable in sustainability analysis (Appolloni et al., 2022 ). Experts were selected among academics with at least 10 years of experience based on Scopus profiles and who had published work with the following keywords: "sustainable" and "cities". 40 profiles were identified and an email was sent stating the scientific purpose of the interview. The first 20 who agreed to undertake the interview were chosen. In this work, only Italian authors were chosen because they were considered more suitable for evaluating the study, the work being centered on the Italian territory. Each expert could choose to make a video call or carry out the questionnaire independently. All values are reported in Appendix 2 . The two reference methodologies are used in the field of sustainability: 10-point scale (Bernardo et al., 2021; Nuuter et al., 2015 ) and AHP (Kik et al., 2021; Scannapieco et al., 2014 ).  Therefore, both may be suitable for evaluating this sustainability-driven work, and a novel approach is proposed to aggregate the different perspectives.   4 Results 4.1 The assessment of the sustainability performance of Italian cities The goal of a MCDA analysis is to compare cities to assess which one performs better. In this paper, cities are compared to each other based on the different indicators that are available. In order to capture the heterogeneity of Italian cities, the first aim of this paper is to aggregate the different information coming from the indicators in order to evaluate which of the Italian cities performs best in terms of sustainability.  Table 3  proposes the ranking among 103 Italian cities-capitals of provinces, according to the 45 indicators available and the performance of each city for all SDGs are reported in Appendix 3 . The results show how the northern cities excel, with Udine ranking first with 0.677, followed by Bolzano (0.669) and Trento (0.660). The best performing central Italian city is Macerata (ranked 10th with 0.644), followed by Siena in 14th place (0.631) and Perugia in 24th place (0.622). Finally, among the southern cities, Nuoro is in 4th place (0.652), followed by Matera in 13th place (0.634) and Cagliari in 19th place (0.626). 58 Italian cities have a value higher than the Italian average of 0.577 and a large share of southern Italian cities (equal to 31) score below the national average value. Palermo, Napoli and Catania close the ranking with values ranging between 0.424 and 0.406. Consequently, the difference between the maximum and the minimum value is 0.271. From a numerical point of view, we can observe that the normalization of the values leads to the effect of having a smaller difference. Among the least performing cities we find Latina (91st place) and Roma (81st place) among the central Italian cities and Alessandria (85th place) and Imperia (77th place) among the northern ones. 4.1.1 The subdivision of Italian cities into groups A further analysis can be conducted dividing Italian cities in groups. This decomposition allows to define 4 cities groups. The national average value is taken as reference and the cities above and below the national average (equal to 0.577) are identified. Within the first group, those cities are then identified that have a higher sustainability value than the upper intermediate value (equal to 0.627) calculated as the average between the maximum and the national average value. Within the second group, a lower intermediate value (equal to 0.491) calculated as the average between the national average value and the minimum value is identified. The following four groups are defined ( Fig. 3 ):• High Up (with a value between 0.627 and 0.677).  • Low Up (with a value between 0.577 and 0.626).  • Low Down (with a value between 0.491 and 0.576).  • High Down (with a value between 0.406 and 0.490).    Once again the map shows how the cities of the North and especially those of the North-East appear to perform better than the others and that the problems relating to sustainable development are more pressing in the South of the country. These results can be compared with the literature in which it is shown that northern regions excel both in the economic dimension and in the social dimension, when compared to central regions and especially to southern regions. The particular finding concerns the environmental dimension of sustainability, where the southern regions excel (D’Adamo et al., 2021 ). In this way, it is possible to compare results obtained at national level with those at local level (city).  4.1.2 The analysis of the best-performing and worst-performing cities Multi-criteria analysis applied to a scenario in which equal weight is assigned to the criteria determines that the more the individual indicators perform, the better the final result will be. However, the greater the number of criteria examined, the more important it will be to evaluate the performance trajectories. For example, Bolzano and Cagliari excel in 5 indicators, while Aosta, Milano, Nuoro, Oristano and Sondrio in 4 indicators. However, among these cities we find Oristano, which is the first city below the Italian average; this result indicates weak performance in other indicators. Furthermore, among these cities we find Bolzano, that is the second ranked, while the first – Udine (which excels only in one indicator) and the third - Trento, which does not excel in any, are missing. It should be noted that the analysis of the first three cities shows low values in indicator 34 and in indicator 40, but in this case with the exception of Trento. The first concerns pedestrian road surfaces in which Lucca predominates and the second concerns usable urban green space where Matera excels ( Fig. 4 ). The graphical comparison with the three cities with the lowest average value is very significant. The levels of concentration of performance are all concentrated at the low end with a few rare exceptions. The comparison among the first three cities indicates that some indicators show a significant difference (for a value of around 0.200): Udine has a lower value in obesity and severe obesity and life expectancy of people at 65 years old; Bolzano in fatalities and injuries in accidents, index of day-care facilities, childcare services 0–16 and political electoral participation; and Trento in schools with ramps, women enrolled in university courses, Gini index and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Finally, the comparison shows weaker performance in ecological islands for Bolzano and Trento, usable urban green space for Udine and Bolzano and social cooperatives for Udine and Trento.  4.1.3 Analyzes of cities at the SDG level The next step in the analysis is to go back to aggregating all indicators according to the individual SDG they belong to and not as a whole. The number of indicators considered is restricted, which is a limitation of this work. However, it is the number of indicators that is currently available to know at the level of individual cities. Aggregating the indicators in this way makes it possible to compare them with those of the regions to which they belong and allows one to highlight in which SDGs one is performing better or less well. For this motive, an additional element of analysis useful in understanding the differences among the different values is to classify the SDG values into three groups:• starting from average value we have considered a group with values around average (± 15 %) called SDG Medium Values and  • two groups with higher and lower values – called SDG High Values and SDG Low Values, respectively.    The cities are listed in the numerical order proposed in Table 3 , and   Figs. 5–6  show their breakdown according to the different SDGs. For example, Udine presents 10 SDG High Values, 5 SDG Medium Values and 1 SDG Low Values. An opposite situation concerns Catania with 1 SDG High Values, 5 SDG Medium Values and 10 SDG Low Values. Given the large number of cities involved,  Table 4  proposes the results for the top ten and the bottom ten cities, highlighting in which SDGs a high value is achieved and in which a low one. This comparison allows to highlight strengths and weaknesses for each city. These indications highlight the distribution of the SDGs across the three groups, but the MCDA is the result of the values of all indicators. Consequently, the final ranking is strongly influenced by the absolute value that the indicator assumes. Clearly, a different ranking criterion (for example, in more than 3 groups or with a different reference range) would have led to different results proposed in Table 4 . While such changes would have had no effect on Table 3 . Thus, the results proposed in Table 3  may change because either the values change over time, a useful exercise for monitoring performance over time, or because one chooses to assign a weight to individual criteria, an option that is also valid for measuring whether or not city ranking is significantly affected by equal weighting among criteria.  4.1.4 The role of indicator concentration in the analysis of cities The difference among cities may not be reported if there is a very similar value within the same indicator. So to understand their impact, it is necessary to measure the concentration index to understand whether or not they are concentrated. A high concentration rate inevitably leads to a smaller difference among cities. Consequently, in order to better understand the results, it is useful to see whether several cities tend to excel in the same indicators ( Fig. 7 ). The level of concentration allows us to observe that there are indicators in which there is a tendency towards 1, and therefore most cities present a high performance value close to the leading city. These indicators include: life expectancy at birth (0.963), quality of housing (0.886), noise pollution (0.875), resident population connected to sewage treatment plants (0.868), digital Divide (0.868), suicide mortality (0.830) and resident population served by sewerage system (0.826). On the other hand, as noted above, in addition to usable urban green space (0.044) and pedestrian road surfaces (0.065), ecolabel licenses (0.153) and density of bicycle lanes (0.189) underline that only very few cities perform well in these indicators.  4.1.5 The aggregation of cities at the level of macro geographical area and population density The last step in this first phase of analysis is to use the breakdown of cities according to the three SDG groups (Section by answering the question proposed earlier in which we wanted to provide a macro-area level judgment from these results. In addition, the literature review showed that the performance of countries, regions and cities also changes according to the number of citizens. Evidently, this is not only true from a numerical point of view. Two magnitudes to be compared should be homogeneous with each other so the absolute value of a large city clearly will be different from that of a small city. The limited number of indicators does not allow for a more in-depth analysis, and other techniques could also be used, but it is useful to identify the breakdown of cities according to the three groups of the SDGs by no longer aggregating them by geographic area, but by size of the number of inhabitants. In this way, a further analysis can be done. The objective is to evaluate performance as a function of macro areas ( Fig. 8 ) and population density ( Fig. 9 ). By focusing on the geographic localization of the sustainable indicators evaluated, we observed that the municipalities located in the north of Italy show the highest level of sustainable development followed by Center and Southern municipalities that register lower levels of indicators. These results are consistent with what has been proposed in the literature and the great brake blocking a growth of Italy. There is a very substantial part of the country that has great potential that is not being fully utilized. Cities falling in the northern area achieve the best performance (SDG High Value) in 6 SDGs, while this value is reduced to 4 and 3 for the central and southern areas respectively. The situation is mirrored when analyzing the worst performance (SDG Low Value). The northern area in 2 SDGs underperforms, while it is 4 SDGs for the central area and 6 SDGs in the southern area. The result is expected since the regional figure is the result of the data of individual cities (in fact it is an aggregation of them), but this analysis allows us to understand whether there are anomalous behaviors within a specific region. For this reason, the analysis in this paper was necessary since it can be repeated in other geographic areas as well. The following classification was used for the size breakdown of cities: Very Big (greater than 2000 inhabitants per km2 ); Big (between 1000 and 2000 inhabitants per km2 ); Medium (between 500 and 1000 inhabitants per km2 ) and Small (less than 500 inhabitants per km2 ). Although some authors (Zhao and Li, 2017 ) have underlined the importance of population density for the achievement of sustainable development, the results obtained do not seem to confirm this hypothesis. In fact, regarding the demographic characteristics of the municipalities analyzed, we classified the cities into four groups based on their population density to analyze SDG indicators as a function of urban clusters. We may note that the population density seems not to be a discriminating parameter as the profiles of the indicators are quite similar with slightly worse results when referring to cities with very high density.   4.2 The analysis of a sustainable development plan for Italian cities The second purpose of this paper is to identify strategic levers capable of fostering sustainable territorial development. The analysis is conducted for all cities regardless of their size since the objective is to start from the framework defined above in order to understand if it can represent a sustainable development plan. Clearly this is an assumption since each municipality has its own organizational structure, a certain number of resources at its disposal. However, it was chosen to define in a generic way what directions a generic city should follow, and this was specified in the research question addressed to the experts. In addition, the identification of the most relevant criterion is done through the hybrid methodology described in Section 2 . Through the two subsequent analyses and the hybrid form, we intend to evaluate which aspects are the most important to achieve the goals proposed by the SDGs in the future and thus increase and improve the indicators used in the first part of the paper. In addition, the selected criteria allow not only for judgments to be made on the indicators proposed above but also for the vision to be extended to a more global spectrum of sustainability by covering its three dimensions - environmental, social and economic. The experts were then involved in a phase in which they identified the relevance of a criterion within each category, thus providing the value of local priority. Similarly, they participated in another phase in which they identified the relevance of the categories, such that the category priority was identified. This parameter makes it possible to make all criteria originally divided by category homogeneous and comparable. Indeed, it is possible to aggregate the information received from the previous two stages and calculate the global priority.  Table 5  proposes not only the results of the AHP but also those associated with the 10-point scale. In this way, it is possible to compare the results obtained inherent to the same analysis question but through two different methodologies. This paper proposes a methodological approach in which a hybrid model is chosen that integrates both approaches. So for example, the criterion Sustainable Policy (POL2) was considered the most relevant by all experts who assigned a value of 10 in accordance with the 10-point scale. This value in order to be compared with the AHP value was normalized. This value of 0.0528 was obtained by dividing the specific value (equal to 10) by the sum of all absolute values of the criteria (equal to 189.30). The same experts also completed the other AHP methodology. Among the three criteria related to Policy, POL2 is the most relevant assuming a value of 0.3850 (local priority). In order to obtain the global priority, 0.3850 is multiplied with 0.1650 (category priority). A value of 0.0635 is obtained. In both methodologies, POL2 occupies the first position and consequently, it will be the first criterion in the ranking of our hybrid methodology as well. The obtained value of 0.0582 is obtained as an equally weighted average between 0.0528 and 0.0635, i.e., the values of the two consolidated starting methodologies. The results obtained should be read under a twofold magnifying glass. The first shows us that the ranking proposed by the two different methodologies is different for about half of the criteria analyzed, even though the same panel of experts evaluates them. Applying the 10-point scale method, the expert assigns a value solely to the criterion analyzed, while in the AHP a pairwise comparison is made. Moreover, in the AHP the result is influenced by category priority and therefore some criteria might be favored by their presence in a particular category. Thus, the AHP is characterized by a feedback action that occurs through the Consistency Ratio that also assesses the reliability of the values assigned by the experts; instead, the 10-point scale is much more intuitive and takes less time to complete. Consequently, the hybrid methodology is proposed to capture the various aspects of both approaches. The numerical values show us that the difference between the first and the last is 1.9 (0.0100 in normalized terms) by applying the 10-point scale, while it is 0.0271 in the AHP. This result indicates that the experts, taking each of the criteria individually, consider them all very relevant and in fact, the least relevant criterion is assigned a very high grade of 8.1. Experts have assigned the maximum value equal to 10 to two criteria (Sustainable policy and Green public investments). The presence of these two criteria led all the experts to assign greater weight to the policy and economy categories; however, this also occurred because the trio of criteria also included Political Stability and Rationing public spending. This has the effect of giving more relevance to the other two criteria Cooperation between public authorities and Recovery/disposal of unused assets due to the category priority, but then these two criteria have the opposite effect when local priority is evaluated. This happens, in fact, because they are directly compared with what are considered the most relevant criteria. The results show that in one case, the criterion associated with the Policy category is favored, while that associated with the Economy category is disfavored. Surely, a pairwise comparison of all 21 criteria might be the best method, but it is not technically feasible. In addition, we can have also cognitive aspects that are not favorable to this choice. Within the AHP, the first two places are always given to Sustainable policy and Green public investments, with 0.0635 and 0.0600, respectively. The gap between these two criteria and the others is the most significant within the entire ranking. Next, we find the other two criteria mentioned above relating to the policy and economy category with a value that fluctuates in the range 0.0543–0.0553. After, we find the leading criteria in the operations (Creation of centers of excellence), environment (Protection of nature reserves/places with high cultural impact) and organization (Graduate training in the field) categories with values ranging from 0.0500 to 0.0533. The identification of these values and the relative ranking represents the second reflection that arises from these results.   5 A sustainability plan for cities: policy implications The number of indicators proposed in this paper is significant, but nevertheless does not cover all aspects of the sustainability. To this should be added that not all goals can always be quantified. This brings us back to the original concept of strategy, which is that military art of coordinating different warfare operations in order to achieve the ultimate goal of war. Our goal is to have more sustainable cities. Policy makers bear the responsibility of fostering this strategy. The first objective of the work has made it possible to take a snapshot, highlighting both positive and negative performance. The next step is to try to identify actions and strategies capable of modifying the current situation. The idea is to provide suggestions to encourage green transition proposing also policy implications. The transition from a theoretical to a practical level turns out to be very complex. This task belongs to policy makers which have the responsibility of steering future choices indicating the road towards which to lead a country by offering spaces of visibility to the ideas of future generations. This is an interpretation of the concept of sustainability. The results obtained in this work indicate that, in experts’ view, all selected criteria contribute to making a city, regardless of its size, more sustainable. This is a difficult challenge that requires an interdisciplinary approach. Mainly we can point to some specific lines of direction. These actions and strategies are inferred from the criticality that has been assigned by the experts (see Table 5 ). Accordingly, the directions proposed in this section were obtained from the values identified in Section 3.2 . For the elaborations of these concepts, an important role was determined by the comments provided by the experts in defining the reasons for the values assigned to the criteria. The first direction (referring to Policy category) is the one in which the decision-maker understands that his/her choices affect not only the present, but also the future. The concept of sustainability is not new, it has about thirty years of history and is linked to human needs that travel at a much faster speed than the resources we have available. It is therefore necessary to re-circulate these resources, making better use of the current ones. A sustainable policy is not only one that applies subsidies to renewable sources and taxes to fossil fuels, but one in which choices are made at the international level. Pollution has a global nature and it is necessary that all countries make their contribution and, in particular, a greater effort must be requested from those who have the greatest impact on the environment. Otherwise, the result is market asymmetries that will make some countries uncompetitive. Sustainable policy is that which seeks to standardize the development of an entire country, that which favors synergies. In the same way, the choices made do not always have a short-term effect and continuity is also needed when there are changes in the political parties that win elections. This concept is easy to write, difficult to implement. Yet no one has ever said that sustainability is an easy challenge. In a collaborative context, the support that various public bodies can give each other becomes fundamental. The second concerns Economy category. Rationing of public spending is the slogan used by all political parties during electoral campaigns and should resemble that move in chess in which the king or queen is faced with a pawn. The result is always disregarded since the interest of a few often prevails over the general interest. This concept is exactly the antithesis of sustainability. The generation of public debt, the interest that accrues on these debts year after year do not find a social justification when these sums are used for ineffective measures. A welfare that may bring some electoral consensus but that takes opportunities away from future generations. It is necessary to overcome phenomena such as Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) and Not In My Terms of Office (NIMTO) and disclose the impact of the do nothing cost. In fact, the Public Administration can and should be a promoter of change, with an active role by investing its money in sustainable initiatives. In this way, it will be able to re-invest the money earned in further actions to protect and benefit the community. The analysis of public investment should be based on well-established methodologies, on the role of managers who support the politician in the decision-making process. Financial analysis does not always indicate a positive value for an action linked to the green economy, the bioeconomy or the circular economy, which is typically the case with economic analysis. It is necessary to assign the correct value to externalities because the damage generated to the environment is not always recoverable as the relationship between sustainability and resilience can be positive provided that natural resources are used sparingly. The third direction concerns the operations that can implement this change. Considering that the three criteria of this category are the only ones on which the experts did not indicate a clear preference, it can be seen that it is necessary to have poles of excellence, necessary to solve the most cumbersome problems, to attract resources from abroad and as a stimulus for improvement for the other structures. Italy is notoriously composed of territories where crime is most infiltrated and despite the many efforts it is a fight that requires the constant presence of the State. For this reason, it is necessary to find solutions, particularly from a financial perspective, to make these structures functional, even if small in size, in these territorial contexts. This, however, should not be confused with maintenance a priori and with a tough fight against inefficiencies, even going so far as to close administrative centers that prove incapable of pursuing goals of effectiveness and efficiency. The fourth direction (referring to Environment category), therefore, is to view the environment neither from a speculative investment perspective nor from an operational standstill. Experts point to the need to preserve certain places such as nature reserves and places with high cultural impact. These are assets and resources that we have inherited from previous generations and that we can direct towards the tourism-culture binomial. It is the maintenance of resources that make an area attractive and transfer benefits to all surrounding activities. This perspective is also supported by the strategic role of the requalification of existing places, in Italy strongly addressed to buildings due to the 110% tax deduction. However, this criterion also includes all the activities of ordinary maintenance that too often are not materialized with diversion of economic funds to other public choices. The fifth direction, referring to Organization category, asks to give graduate and post-graduate students experience in the field in order to bring the academic world closer to the professional one. The goal is to bring the professional world closer to the academic one. This is an aspect that has been debated in Italy for some time and needs to be implemented. Finally, it is necessary to overcome another critical element typically opposed in public administration, namely, work flexibility. The global system is dynamic and requires resources, including human resources, to be directed where they are required. Industrial experience has shown that there can be major improvements driven by continuous adaptation. The sixth direction (referring to Staff category) concerns a change in the Public Administration with the inclusion of new professional figures, primarily technical profiles that can intercept the innovations related to digitization and sustainability. Similarly, a generational change is required, such as placing junior profiles alongside senior ones in order to know how to combine innovation and experience. The seventh direction, referring to Society category, concerns the message that needs to be delivered to society, as there is a strong demand for change from the younger generation. However, the changes made must move in the right direction. This brings back into play the earlier concept of how school and university education can move dynamics geared toward achieving goals that are as inclusive as they are sustainable. The pandemic has spread the development of webinars in which ideas and solutions are proposed, but above all where it is possible to interact because the spread of dedicated meetings is more incisive than a classic information campaign. The post-pandemic will see a return to a greater physical presence through public seminars, however, the wealth of innovation that webinars have introduced should not be abandoned. These meetings could be the right stage to listen to innovative and inclusive strategies and actions that have been successful, representing best practices. The results obtained define that sustainable policy and green public investments are the two pillars to make cities sustainable and we can observe that this result is certainly influenced by the Next Generation EU that puts emphasis on these two criteria. It is only a matter of moving from the theoretical to the practical sphere, a complex but not impossible challenge. And here, then, that the eighth direction comes into play, the human component, the personal component in which everyone in his or her own small way is called upon to make a contribution. It is transversal to all of the above. It is time to act, to propose and not to stop at sterile polemics. These directions can try to make future cities more sustainable. This work therefore considers eight directions (policy, economy, operations, environment, organization, staff, society and human) that provide practical suggestions for making Italian cities more sustainable optimizing land use. However, the assessments can also be applied to the global context. The most relevant policy is to make all countries part of the change, with greater accountability of the countries that pollute the most globally and financial instruments to protect the poorest countries. The analysis at the national level must then be applied at the level of each individual city because there can be no asymmetries. To apply a sustainable policy means to implement actions in which sustainability is demonstrated and in this science is called to give answers. Because in this way the incentives given will be economically justified by the consideration that the new green practices will lead to economic growth that will not damage the environment and will protect social cohesion. The issue of the sustainability of cities is a hot topic. Various estimates have shown that migration to cities will continue to grow due to social and work needs and a combination of opportunities. However, the figure that needs to be reflected on, is how much the incidence of population in some areas of the country can actually do well for its sustainability or produce a worsening instead. This paper cannot provide numbers to give answers, as it is true that the proposed results do not show significant changes, but nevertheless the set of indicators used is limited. These directions and interpretations of results are useful to policy makers for multiple reasons. The first is to verify whether or not their plan for sustainable cities includes these criteria. The second is to assess whether or not the relevance they give coincides with the relevance noted in this paper. Clearly, future studies will need to look at the identification of any criteria not considered in this paper and a different panel of experts to give solidity to the results obtained. In the meantime, a policy path can be built in which sustainability plays a key role and strategies are identified to achieve the different goals that make up a sustainable city.  6 Conclusions The development of cities towards the theme of sustainability is a very complex challenge because it is a system that is composed of different relationships, in which the calculation of an optimal point shows applicative difficulties. In this context, the identification of rankings from available data can indicate positive, but also negative performance and allows to outline future paths. This work has highlighted that on the basis of a robust methodology it is possible to draw up a ranking among the Italian cities examined that sees the northern ones excel and in particular, at the top are Udine, Bolzano and Trento. Diametrically opposed is the situation of Palermo, Naples and Catania that close the ranking. The multi-criteria indicator has the advantage of aggregating different information. In addition, as emerged from the set of analysis different insights, can be proposed to capture the determinants that affect the results obtained. The limitations of this work may be associated with the number of indicators considered, but all available ones were evaluated and by the methodology applied in which the weighted average was analyzed. This choice is justified by the literature, which, however, also presents other approaches. It is therefore necessary as much to increase the indicators as to consider different weights for the criteria in order to give robustness to the results achieved. In addition, a framework was built on 21 possible actions and strategies to build a plan for the sustainable development of Italian cities and their relative lands. Sustainable policy and green public investments are the fundamental elements of this plan but there are many activities that can be carried out. In this way, they can be defined as enabling factors of sustainable cities. However, there is not a long time horizon in which to apply them, because climate pollution has become a global problem on par with the COVID-19 pandemic. The work shows some limitations related to a panel of experts that could involve more stakeholders, data that do not follow time series, the inability to study the dependencies among the criteria examined but nevertheless is easy to replicate at the global level. It is also worth pointing out that it is necessary to follow the temporal trend of this indicator of sustainability, which can act as a stimulus for cities to make progress or preserve a high position in the rankings. Sustainable cities are not only about SDG11 but also have effects on the other SDGs and call for placing society at the center of the issue, understood as a sharing of values and ideas between the current generation and the future generation. Finally, one of the main aspect capturing the goodness of a methodology is its replicability. Replication is a term referring to the repetition of a research study, generally with different situations and different subjects, to determine if the basic findings of the original study can be applied to other participants and circumstances. The proposed methodology has the undoubted advantage of being rather easy to implement in different territorial contexts. The main difficulty to be faced if we want to compare the different results obtained is to refer to the same set of indicators. The definition of the indicators can be carried out by searching for a range of indicators whose combination allows the study of such a complex phenomenon as sustainable development. The definition of the set of indicators should also be clear, with a unique meaning for each indicator and simple to calculate. It should be possible to verify the correctness of the measures provided, be clearly referred to the same period of time and be applicable to different territories in order to allow relative effectiveness assessments. In particular, it is of substantial importance to limit the number of indicators because as they increase, the risk that they are correlated grows. In summary, we can therefore define the main attributes of an effective set of indicators: multidimensionality, objectivity, temporal adequacy and timeliness, adequacy, completeness, simplicity and limited number. However, in defining the indicators, it is necessary to take into account the fact that these are then used for incentive sustainable development policies. This increases the difficulty of defining a single set of indicators valid for all territories whether they are nations, regions, provinces or cities.
