                  For all the evolutionary ages of mineral resource development, there have not been concerns about sustainable mining until the 21st century. Thus, this paper explores the extent to which emerging geospatial technologies have been deliberately used in the mining industry activities to achieve the United Nations Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Governments, the mining industry, Non-Governmental and International Organisations have various investments in geospatial programmes and technologies for Environmental and Social Impact Assessments and baseline studies to enhance the achievement of these goals. However, these efforts prove inadequate to link the social, environmental and economic baseline analysis of sustainable development goals. The observations in this paper, therefore, have been obtained largely from extensive literature review to gain a broad understanding of previous and current applications of emerging technologies in the field. The literature has been explored in two successive steps. First, the literature was broadly queried to find the most current works on sustainable mining for three decades (i.e. 1990 to 2019). Second, out of over 100 papers, reports, and books retrieved in the first step, a more specific search and analysis of existing academic and industry literature on the explicit applications of emerging geospatial technology for enhancing sustainable development in the mining sector was conducted. In spite of its ensemble of capabilities for multivariate analysis, analysis of the literature reveals that there is inadequate adaptation of emerging geospatial technologies, which can simultaneously measure and link generally acceptable social, economic and environmental costs and benefits of mining for sustainability considerations in a local setting. There is a dearth of literature that discuss this new approach in addressing sustainable mining. Findings of this paper shall, therefore, inform the scientific community, industry, Non-Governmental Organisations and consultants on emerging approaches to address salient issues of sustainable mining towards meeting the agenda 2030 SDGs.

Keywords Mining  Agenda 2030  Sustainable development  Geospatial information  Remote sensing    1 Introduction Mining is arguably the oldest industry in the history of civilization (Gregory and Gregory, 1980 ). It started with the crude stone implements of the early Palaeolithic period that gave birth to hunting and gathering, and eventually agriculture; then evolved to the Post-Neolithic pottery, the Egyptian pyramids, the search for iron and manganese and the modern steel age (Hooke, 2000 ). For all these evolutionary ages of mineral resource extraction, there have not been concerns about sustainable development until the 21st century (Mondal et al., 2013 ). Since the adoption of the United Nations (UN) Agenda 2030, which introduces the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015, governments of member states and their economic development partners in the mining industry have been declared to be resolute at putting in place mechanisms that would meet the goals of the agenda (Monteiro et al., 2019 ). The 17 SDGs are: “No Poverty” (SDG1), “Zero Hunger” (SDG2), “Good Health” (SDG3), “Quality Education” (SDG4), “Gender Equality” (SDG5), “Clean Water and Sanitation” (SDG6), “Affordable and Clean Energy” (SDG7), “Decent Work and Economic Growth” (SDG8), “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure” (SDG9), “Reduced Inequality” (SDG10), “Sustainable Cities and Communities” (SDG11), “Responsible Consumption and Production” (SDG12), “Climate Action” (SDG13), “Life Below Water” (SDG14), “Life on Land” (SDG15), “Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions” (SDG16) and “Partnership for the Goals” (SDG17) (UN, 2018 ). Initiatives, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the World Bank's Equator Principles and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, have been launched to examine the sustainability adherence of the mining industry (Han Onn and Woodley, 2014 ). Yet, much uncertainty remains in adopting a knowledge system that has the potential to concurrently measure generally acceptable social, economic and environmental costs and benefits of mining for sustainability considerations in a local setting. The mining industry needs to be evaluated regarding its ability to offer a knowledge system for stakeholders that can model future scenarios in a region to ensure optimum benefit for both companies and the local communities that host mining activities. However, many mineral resource-rich countries, especially in the global south, lack the rudimentary technological safeguards for environmentally and socially responsible mining (Aznar-Sánchez et al., 2019 ). These countries need applications of technology that would replace traditional means of analyzing exploration activities, mining operations and the environment (Batterham, 2014 ). In respect of geographic location, environmental endowments such as geology, land cover, land use and social values, the contributions of a mine to the local achievement of specific SDGs fundamentally depend on a local context. However, a framework for assessing risks, benefits and trade-offs can be offered to local stakeholders through a combination of modern technologies (mobile phones, laptops) and more traditional approaches (paper/pen/oral) (Ray et al., 2016 ). In many cases, key environmental and social data are collected during the mineral exploration process but not actively shared with state and local governments and the communities. State institutions and host local communities also need access to high quality information to assess benefits and risks and get a better understanding of sustainability issues in mine operations as early as possible in the decision making process. Lack of access to basic geographic and contextual information among the primary stakeholders (the local communities), increases the information asymmetries leading to miscommunication and misunderstandings of benefits and risks accruing from mining projects. In as much as the industry itself has an obligation to adopt various mechanisms towards achieving the SDGs, the world of science and technology has a major stake and role to play in this noble endeavor. For instance, few years after the publication of the Brundtland Commission's report (1987), which did the seminal work on the present day SDGs, von Below (1993)  suggested that to achieve the SDGs in the mining sector, there is a call for a deliberate allocation of resources on research into exploration and applicable technological innovations (Maroušek, 2015 ). In their guidelines for improving sustainability in the mining industry, Hilson and Murck (2000)  recommend the application of the findings of scientific research based on efficient technological methods to improve training and knowledge gaps. Also, the Toronto Declaration of May 2002, which concluded the Global Sustainable Development Initiative, states: “Research and technology are vital to the Sustainable Development initiative, if the mining industry is to keep or be granted a “social license” to operate” (Rajaram et al., 2005 ). In addition, Gorman and Dzombak (2018)  suggest that to maximize the value of data for achieving the SDGs in the mining sector operations, innovative scientific approaches are needed for effective data integration, management, analysis, and monitoring. That said, more technological work is required to develop a set of core local sustainability indicators and align these with overall SDG monitoring. Therefore, scientists, in collaboration with their industry partners, need to develop various methods and technologies for addressing sustainability issues in the mining sector. A new technology that has a significant role to play in this discourse is the geospatial sector, which comprises of Earth Observation and Remote Sensing, Global Positioning Systems, Photogrammetry, Drones and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Increasingly, these are being combined with other technologies such as cloud computing, sensors connected to the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain (Fiannacca et al., 2017 ). However, the use of these advanced technological tools in dealing with the problems related to sustainable development is new in the context of sustainable mining. Their usefulness and application in this regard is still rudimentary and needs to be investigated. Inspite of the use of these technologies, there still exist inadequate understanding of sustainability issues in the mining sector operations and a lack of established location associations between the triple-bottom-line concept in sustainable mining. The unexplored questions are: can technological advancement really address sustainability in the extractives sector? To what extent are the new geospatial technologies applied in enhancing sustainable development in the mining industry by offering stakeholders equal access to trusted information? How can the positive and negative impacts of mining be more systematically monitored using technology? How can geospatial tools and data better support governments and local communities in their decision-making processes towards a resilient and sustainable future in mineral resource development? In a bid to seek answers to these questions, this paper, hereby, explores the extent to which geospatial technology have been deliberately used towards achieving the SDGs in the mining industry.  2 Methods The observations in this paper have been conducted largely on an extensive review of existing literature and practice guidelines. The literature has been explored in a two successive stepwise procedure. First, broad literature database searches were engaged to find relevant academic and industry-based literature on sustainable mining for three decades (i.e. 1990 to 2019). The search terms that were used include: “sustainable mining”, “sustainability in the mining industry”, “sustainability in the extractive sector”, and “sustainable development in the mining sector”. About 100 peer-reviewed journal papers and associated industry publications with similar titles to the search terms were retrieved from all databases that were searched. Secondly, a more specific search and detailed analysis of the retrieved existing academic and industry literature were performed to find the applications of innovative technologies; explicitly on the use of geospatial technologies, for supporting the achievement of the UN Agenda 2030 SDGs in the mining sector. Search terms that have been used include: “applications of innovative technologies for responsible mining”, “applications of geospatial tools for sustainable mining”, “applications of geospatial technology for sustainable mining”, “applications of geographic information systems for enhancing sustainable mining”, “the use of GIS to enhance sustainability in the mining sector operations”, “Remote Sensing and GIS for enhancing sustainable mineral resource extraction”, “Applications of Remote Sensing to assess sustainability performance of the mining sector” and “The use of geospatial technology for developing sustainability performance indicators in the resources sector”. This technique also retrieved less than 50 published records with similar terms and titles. Literature without primary objectives on sustainable mining or sustainability in the mining industry or applications of geospatial technologies were not considered in this search. For instance, a publication about a specific mining technology that may mention a particular sustainability outcome was not included in the body of work. This paper considers sustainable mining as an analysis of all outcomes, holistically, rather than a single criteria analysis (Parameswaran, 2016 ). Online libraries, repositories, databases and search engines that have been engaged during the survey include: ScienceDirect, Scopus, SciELO, Social Science Research Network, ResearchGate, Gale, arXiv, JSTOR, Library Genesis, CNKI, Web of Science, ISI Web of Knowledge, Wikipedia, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Thomson Reuters, ProQuest, Emerald Publishing Limited, Google Scholar and Elsevier BV.  3 Results 3.1 Prospects on the applications of geospatial techniques towards sustainable mining Geospatial technology can be effectively used in all phases of the mining sector operations; from site suitability analysis (by geologists, environmentalists or engineers) to exploration, extraction, site safety management and disaster prevention (SDG3), closure and reclamation (Bauer and Ford, 2014 ). For instance, Scott (2012)  study on the use of geospatial technology reveals that about 70% of disaster management practitioners in all industries currently use geospatial technology in highly efficient disaster risk management and assessment. An example is the use of drones and satellite imagery to monitor the 500 km tailings dam burst incident at the iron ore mine of Mariana and Brumadinho in Brazil. Mine expansion and the changes that are associated with it can be assessed in a geospatial environment. Such changes include the loss or removal of vegetation and important species, displacement of wildlife in relation to loss of habitat and forest fragmentation, direction of wildlife movement to predict disease infestation and sources in new communities, and change in land cover types with an attendant impact on land use and livelihoods (SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 15). The technology also aids in investigating land degradation caused by surface or subsurface mining (Moomen and Dewan, 2017 ). Efficient application of the geospatial technology also provides information about indiscriminate acidic discharges and disposal of waste materials into the nearby water bodies that harm agricultural production and ecosystems (SDGs 6 and 14) (Gardner and Sainato, 2007 ). There exist also several examples whereby geospatial technology is used to perform concurrent analysis of mining in forest and sustainable forest ecosystems (SDGs 12 and 15). These include the works of Abood et al. (2015); Goparaju et al. (2017); Schueler et al. (2011)  and Wickham et al. (2007) . The use of varying degrees of spatial and spectral resolutions of satellite data, such as Landsat-Multi Spectral Scanner (MSS), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), ETM (Enhanced Thematic Mapper), Linear Imaging Self Scanner (LISS) II, III and IV, to map the extent of mining areas and other land uses in the same location (Moomen et al., 2016 ) proves the potentials of geospatial technologies in sustainability assessment in the mining sector. Multi-temporal satellite imagery and the use of drones are most efficient geospatial tools that have been applied to track the activities of illegal miners in many countries. Examples of such applications include the works of Snapir et al. (2017); Suresh and Jain (2013) . For instance, the government of Ghana employed the use of drones, briefly, in its recent fight against illegal mining in forested areas and along drainage channels of major river systems in the country. This initiative reinforced SDGs 12, 14 and 15 of the UN Agenda 2030. However, the full potentials of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) like drones for combating activities in the mining sector that will jeopardise sustainable development have still been under explored in other countries like Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Columbia, lately Liberia and Ghana. Thus, geospatial technology has a rich and under explored capabilities that can be harnessed to aid in combating illegal mining activities entirely; safeguard important ecosystem services, agriculture, livelihood and promote sustainable mining in the countryside.  3.2 Global geospatial drives on sustainable mining towards the agenda 2030 SDGs In recognition of sustainable development as an important element of environmental regulatory programmes, the USA Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) charged the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to identify possible ways to incorporate sustainability performance indicators into its impact assessment decision-making processes. In its report to the USEPA, the NRC suggested that to address the three sustainability pillars, a systems engineering approach should be adopted (Craynon et al., 2016 ). The approach involves the applications of geospatial tools, as mentioned above, to simultaneously analyse the three sustainability pillars. The three Sustainable Development pillars are: economic well-being, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship; often referred to as the ‘triple bottom-line (TBL) (Elkington, 1998 ). The UN Summit that adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals calls for promoting “transparent and accountable scaling-up of appropriate public-private cooperation to exploit the contribution to be made by a wide range of data, including Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial information, while ensuring national ownership in supporting and tracking progress” (UN, 2016 ). As a result, the past decade has seen numerous initiatives and incentives to make spatial data in all sectors more available, more accessible, and more integrated. Since spatial data production, access, dissemination and use are associated with standards, regulations, legislation, land use, administrative boundaries, infrastructure and other human factors, the development of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) has become an enabling platform for efficient geospatial data management and analysis (Ray et al., 2016 ). Hence, regional efforts in this context are about the opportunities created through the direct or indirect instigation of governments of both developed and developing mineral resource-rich countries. The efforts and contributions of their development partners at International Organisations (IOs) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) levels are also included in this role. Examples include the works of Digital Earth Africa and the Africa Regional Data Cube (ARDC). At the UN conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in 2015, the importance of space-technology-based data and reliable geospatial information for sustainable development policy making, programming and project operations was recognised (UN, 2016 ). Therefore, concerted efforts have been harnessed towards developing global environmental observing systems in this respect. Today, a larger global effort to promote sustainable development in the minerals and mining industry is that of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). GEO is a unique global network and voluntary partnership with a current total of 105 member countries. It also has a current total of 127 Participating Organizations that are coordinating the implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) across the globe. GEO connects government institutions, data providers, academic and research institutions, businesses, engineers, scientists and experts to build innovative solutions to global issues (Harris and Baumann, 2015 ). The AfriGEOSS, AmeriGEOSS, AOGEOSS and EuroGEOSS are the regional initiatives of the GEO community which are established to promote collaboration and coordination among the GEO members in Africa, America, Asia-Oceania, and European regions, respectively. These initiatives focus their efforts on those Societal Benefit Areas (SBAs) selected and prioritized by a region. These SBAs include support for decision-making and regional sustainable development with EO information. One of the most promising investments made by GEO is the Digital Earth Africa and the development of the ARDC. Also, the European Union's (EU) Copernicus programme, which is hosted by the European Space Agency (ESA), is an EO Programme, which has been established to provide a multi-scale coverage of the Earth surface. Copernicus data from “the Sentinels” is free open data and can be used to support mineral resource exploration and to monitor the environmental performance of the mining sector (Gascon et al., 2014 ). Similar developments include the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat and new applications such as Planet Labs. These sets of EO offer a dynamic opportunity to collect and process spatial data that would enhance sustainable mineral resource development; from exploration to exploitation and to closure, with a variety of methods and tools (Harris and Baumann, 2015 ). Following the establishment of the Agenda 2030, the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDGs (IAEG-SDGs) of the UN's Statistical Commission determined that an implementation plan at all levels was feasible if a wide range of data, including Earth observations and geospatial information could be exploited and used. The report of the IAEG-SDGs (in March 2016) noted that adequate local indicators could be produced by integrating both statistical data and geospatial information. As a result, in 2016 the IAEG-SDGs created the Working Group on Geospatial Information Management (GGIM). The specific tasks of the GGIM include: a review of the SDGs indicators with respect to 'geographic location', identify geospatial data gaps, methodological and measurements issues, consider the significance of geospatial information to the indicators in terms of communicating and visualizing the geographic dimensions and context of the indicators where appropriate; provide national and regional level experiences and best practices in geospatial data production. In a related development, in 2014, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), through the Crisis Management Branch, UNEP-GRID-Geneva and the World Bank, started a special initiative dubbed: ‘Mapping and Assessing the Performance of Extractive Industries’ (MapX) (Lacroix et al., 2019 ). The original mission of MapX was to act as an initiative that would enhance transparency, spatial data sharing, analysis and visualisation of the economic, social and environmental performance of the extractive sector. The initiative is supported by a global online open source platform for managing geospatial data on natural resources. Geospatial data from MapX is now being used to power the World Environment Situation Room, which is the new vision of UN Environment to monitor the state of the planet in near real time. This vision was reinforced by the adoption of a new resolution during the 4th UN Environment Assembly on “Keeping the world environment under review: enhancing the United Nations Environment Programme science-policy interface and endorsement of the Global Environment Outlook”. The technical developments and the scientific work that will be done in biodiversity planning and other topics will surely benefit the activities of MapX in the extractives. In particular, its focus is to support the sustainable use of natural resources by increasing access to the best available geospatial information, technology, monitoring tools and capacity building. One of MapX's operational principles is to harmonize information held by different stakeholders, eliminate geospatial data fragmentation and use such as a prerequisite to support better dialogue, decision making and monitoring. This objective of MapX leverages the achievement of several goals of the UN Agenda 2030. Notable among them are goals 16 and 17 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; and Partnerships for the Goals).  3.3 Scientific applications of geospatial technology for assessing sustainable mining One major priority line of the UN Agenda 2030 SDGs is the development of local level monitoring systems to assess and control areas that are subject to intensive natural resource development investments. Accordingly, scientists have applied various models for monitoring the effects of mining at local levels using geoinformation technologies. In particular, Remote Sensing and GIS technologies are used to perform remote monitoring of the impacts of mining on the environment and land use, using data from different sources and from different time periods. For example, Naydenova and Roumenina (2009)  used Remote Sensing and GIS to monitor the effects of coal mining at drainage basin level of the Kutina river in Bulgaria. Effects that have been found include the generation of landslide processes, self-ignition of coal layers, changes in the hydrographic network, increases in lateral erosion and a resultant Kutina Pyramids natural landmark's degradation. This informs an enhancement of SDG14 (Life Below Water). Goparaju et al. (2017)  employed geospatial technology and collated data from different sources to identify the impacts of different mining operations on forest ecosystems. The authors highlight that an application of geospatial technology could help to support the achievement of a sustainable forest ecosystem, which could enhance SDG15 (Life on Land). Thus, lately, the use of GIS and Remote Sensing data has become a key element for assessing the sustainability performance of the mining industry at the local levels. He et al. (2009)  applied Remote Sensing techniques to monitor the potential threats of landslides to sustainable safe mining in the Luoshan mining area in China. The study found the monitoring curves between sliding force and time, which can describe and forecast trends of early warning signs of landslides caused by mining in the area. These findings align with the objectives of SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). In a study that assesses mining and its impacts on the environment, Woldai (2001)  identifies the progress of the evolution of various geospatial tools for capturing robust and detailed geo-information for improving mining-induced environmental problems. Woldai (2001) , however, laments on the absence, incompleteness, inadequacy or inaccuracy of geospatial information regarding mine operations and their impacts on soil, water and vegetation, which form the basis of rural livelihood (SDGs 1 and 2) in most parts of the world (Maroušek et al., 2019 ). These observations informed the study of Baeten et al. (2016)  to illuminate the spatial extent of mining across the Lake Superior Iron District with the use of historical GIS. The study found that the intensification of low-grade ore mining resulted in new environmental stress at the locations of processing plants; tailings drainage from mine-sites into waterbodies and neighbouring land uses. To assess environmental sustainability under mining regulation policies, Yang, et al. (2018a), Yang, et al. (2018b), Yu, et al. (2018)  and Vasuki et al. (2018)  used Remotely Sensed Satellite Imagery to detect the dynamics of vegetation disturbance and recovery in mining areas at different sites. In particular, Yang, et al. (2018a)  study revealed that between 1989 and 2014, about 2982 ha out of 4573 ha of disturbed land in the Curragh coal mine site in Australia had been covered by vegetation. Meanwhile, about 95% of previous mine sites has been seeded and rehabilitated. With regards to reclamation, ArcMine is a new GIS extension that has been developed to support reclamation planning in abandoned mining areas (Kim et al., 2012 ). Basically, ArcMine tools can be applied to: detect subsidence hazards, estimate erosion of wastes, analyze surface water flows, and perform reclamation suitability analysis on mine sites. In Korea, ArcMine has been used to examine previous mine sites and the results show that it is an efficient reclamation planning and mine hazard detection tool. Pavloudakis et al. (2009)  integrated GIS and multi-criteria decision-making methods to perform a post-mining land use suitability analysis at different sites in Greece. Variables considered in this experiment include social factors, technical, economic, environmental and safety factors. The application demonstrates that an integration of GIS and the decision-support system allows for the determination of the most appropriate post-mining land use without the introduction of biases in the process. Similar examples could be found in Lechner et al. (2016) .   4 Discussion Despite the wealth of applications of geospatial technologies on data generation and analysis of the social and environmental impacts of the mining sector, much of it is limited to single variable study analyses. Most applications focus on the environmental or social impacts of mining. Examples include the works of Antwi et al. (2017); Bernhardt and Palmer (2011); Edwards et al. (2014); Khalil et al. (2014); Mancini and Sala (2018) . Very little works have shown applications of geospatial technologies to link the social and environmental impacts of mining with specific economic implications. Much less has been analysed using the technology to identify local economic systems that are vulnerable to the negative impacts of mining at community, national and regional levels. Applications of the geospatial tools on sustainability issues of the mining sector require a holistic study and analysis of the TBL to fully understand sustainability-related opportunities and threats (Blachowski and Herkt, 2018 ). In a successful sustainability-focused scientific analysis, the TBL must be interrelated and supportive of each other. Moreover, an efficient application of geospatial technology in this respect must be customized to meet the core principles of Agenda 2030 SDGs; using locally generated data and resources to understand the sustainability challenges faced by both local communities and the industry. In this respect, new data sources and technologies for data collection and for the integration of different sources of data need to be explored. At the moment, the full of potentials of geospatial technologies in this respect have been underexplored. In section 3.2 , the recommendations of the National Research Council (NRC), USA, did not explicitly focus on the mining sector sustainability performance indicators. The recommendations may, therefore, call for compromised solutions in respect of the mining industry sustainability issues. However, compromised solutions can disparage the principles and values of sustainable development. It requires identifying and dealing fairly with all affected communities from the very conception of a project (Buxton, 2012 ). Also, to strengthen sustainable development in the mining context, Joint-efforts have been encouraged rather than singular efforts of individual entities (UN, 2016 ). This drive includes collaborative efforts between scientists, state and local governments, International Organisations and NGOs. Besides, the recommendations did not explain how the TBL data could be generated and how such data can be incorporated in GIS. Whereas in the USA, spatial data for the TBL is readily available, in other developing countries, spatial data are mostly non-existent (Wylie et al., 2019 ). Even if available, geospatial data in these countries are mostly outdated and cannot be applied in the utmost interest of sustainable mining. Hence, an adoption of the systems engineering approach, in its present form, is problematic and may not be feasible in developing countries until data generation mechanisms are explicitly incorporated in it. In this regard, GEOSS aims to provide access to environmental data and information on eight Societal Benefit Areas (SBAs), including energy and mineral resource management. In its 2017–2019 schedules, GEO has launched a new work agenda on “Earth Observations for Managing Mineral Resources” dubbed as “CA-06”. In this programme, GEO seeks to use Earth Observations (EO) for improving environmentally and socially responsible mining activities. However, the CA-06 has not been active since its launch and has defeated its intent. In the current state of GEO, however, there is no dedicated EO program for assessing and monitoring the mining sector sustainability performance. While the GEO uses EO systems and programs from other SBAs, there is no global coverage by high-spectral resolution satellite sensors with a focus on the mining sector operations. In addition, its regional initiatives are still under development and do not have field applications to demonstrate their mining sector sustainability interests. As such, the programmes of the SBA's of the various regional initiatives do not reflect a vested interest in the mining sector sustainability enhancement. Nonetheless, there is no specific component of the tasks that explores an integration of the geospatial information and other field-based data for the development of indicators relevant to the mining sector activities at a national, regional and global scale. This gap is a challenge to global measurement of indicators that can inform better policy formulation for properly regulating the mineral resource sector. By providing access to spatial data such as biodiversity, endangered species, forests, watersheds and locations of illegal activities, MapX could be a powerful tool with the necessary information to address these gaps and the objectives of the Agenda 2030 SDGs. For MapX to realize these good intents and drives, more global hands are required for specific local spatial data generation and development. It needs an effective effort to harness a combination of both open data and private data held by different stakeholders. In recent times, however, MapX has evolved from its original focus on the mineral resource sector to embrace other objectives including biodiversity planning, disaster risk reduction, chemicals management and environmental security. Thus, MapX is now supporting a large portfolio of critical initiatives at various stages of execution at various geographical scales, from local to regional to global. Therefore, unless carefully strategized, planned, and executed, many of these ambitious objectives may not live up to their full potential and MapX may not deliver its initially intended sustainable development objectives, as it pertains to the extractive sector. When an organization outspread its resources across diverging objectives, expectations seldom match outcomes. Perhaps, the most strategically important objectives may be achieved. But, having a prioritization process in place to protect its original focus on sustainable development of the extractives will make the Map-X initiative more effective. While geospatial techniques in general are not new to the mining industry, there is a considerable knowledge gap regarding the interpretation of data and the dissemination of relevant information between the industry players and various categories of primary stakeholders (communities and public authorities). Some primary stakeholders from local communities that host exploration and mining activities may have a broader understanding of mining operations and be able to interpret maps. However, this group of stakeholders may usually lack specific knowledge about the mine operation in their vicinity as well as key potential benefits and risks. There are also people at the community level who have very little idea about mining until exploration companies appear in their backyard. Public authorities also have a continuum of access to information and policies that can inform their decision making fall; they have the fully informed, semi-informed, and the information deficit ones. Mining and exploration companies usually have well-trained and sophisticated staff, who can read and interpret geospatial technology-based Earth Observation (EO) imagery. Companies, scientists, national governments and International Organisations can use the technology for mine planning, baseline analysis and post-mining reconstruction management with cognizance to meeting the specific goals of the UN Agenda 2030 SDGs. It is not the same with public authorities and local representatives, especially in developing countries. Meanwhile, geospatial research and data collection processes and procedures predetermine how likely or unlikely these groups will assimilate relevant sustainability information shared. Moreover, natural resource focused information is traditionally represented on and retrieved from maps (Rithin Paul Reddy et al., 2020 ). A society's efficient management of its natural resources and the environment can be judged based upon its ability to apply knowledge and interpret the indispensable information available. Thus, a major challenge found from the literature is how to transform raw geospatial data into knowledge, and to keep this knowledge current for decision makers, investors and citizens, because environmental and social issues are changing rapidly. For instance, in cases of dialogue for comparable indicators and sustainability performance assessment of a company, an exploration or mining company may readily sit in a “roundtable” discussion with knowledgeable stakeholders than with a speculator stakeholder group whose position is based on external informants and assumptions (Azapagic, 2004 ). Thus, future scientific works must be developed to address these knowledge gaps regarding how to disseminate research results and data to stakeholders in such a way that primary stakeholders may perceive and associate geospatial data to realities on the ground. Analysis of local realities on the ground, including primary stakeholder participation during data collection, combined with data generated from EO technologies should be modified to offer results that reflect scientific rigour while at the same time allowing stakeholder accessibility. Sustainability indicators originating from such methodological combinations have a good chance of general acceptance and can enhance sustainable mining in a local setting. As indicated by Falck and Spangenberg (2014) , the modes and media of communication between different groups of stakeholders are determined by the cultural and institutional context. To address the issues concerning mining and its contributions towards achieving the UN's Agenda 2030 SDGs, there is the need to assess the potentials and prospects of geospatial tools available for capturing robust and detailed geoinformation, processing, analysing and interpreting these data in mining areas. As such, a systematic and multidisciplinary approach of mapping, assessing and monitoring the trends of sustainability indicators emanating from the mining industry activities is basic. Meanwhile, multidisciplinary measures are required so as to understand the character and magnitude of the sector's sustainability performance in an area (Craynon et al., 2016; Purvis et al., 2019 ). Geospatial technology plays vital role in harnessing environmental, economic and social data; covering large geographic areas in different time periods and for inaccessible areas (Yu et al., 2018 ). Thus, enlightened primary stakeholder groups and public authorities, if given access, could use companies' existing and historical geospatial data for sustainability assessment purposes. However, data provided by companies may not be reliable or accessible for effective sustainability assessment of their own operational activities. The tendency is that the principles of sustainable development may be compromised. Hence, scientists are required to generate and provide an independent, unbiased information and databases. Such databases would present an opportunity for establishing a common mode and media of communication between stakeholders. Without a strategic application of the evolving geospatial technologies, the current applications of new technologies are only extractive centred and not sustainability focused. Often, the mining industry gets excited to herald the benefits of technological advancements and associate these to its efforts in the raw material supply chain of manufacturing companies. However, history has shown us that even if beneficial, these technologies are not always necessarily used to balance the costs and benefits of mining between companies, the countries and communities that host their operations. For instance, since the introduction of the principles of sustainable development into the minerals and mining sector agenda, two major paradigm shifts that have taken place are the extraction of minerals from lower-grade ores and the expansion of surface mining (Pedro, 2016 ). This shift has been possible with the advent of new technologies, which benefit none either than exploration and mining companies; employing fewer people and consuming more productive land (Rajaram et al., 2005 ). Examples of such technologies include Heap Leach SX-EW, and High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL). The exact benefits of this technology to sustainable development is non-existent or negligible. Perhaps, it is only through the activities of scientific research that the new opportunities offered by the earnest applications of geospatial technologies can be adopted to enhance an achievement of the principles and values of the UN Agenda 2030 SDGs. However, at the moment the literature on this discourse is still at early stages and inadequate. 4.1 Limitations and recommendations Nonetheless, the methods used in this review paper have a few limitations. The search engines and terms used could not discriminate between scientific papers and technology hosts and vendor publications that advertise the capabilities of their products. For instance, the publications of ESRI on the capabilities of ArcGIS extensions and the functions of GEO were encountered several times in the broader searches. Considering the specific purposes of their publications could, therefore, lead to compromises of the main objectives of the paper. To overcome this challenge, scientific publications that have applied such technological capabilities on field-based projects have been rather used in place of the host or vendor publications. Hence, care must be taken in future searches to avoid running pseudo advertisement for companies and organisations rather than writing views based on empirical works. Another limitation of the paper is that its focus at the moment is narrowed to scientific works on the applications of geospatial technology for geoinformation development and the mining sector sustainability assessment, especially, at global scale. These criteria could overlook literature that are relevant to the applications of geoinformation in any two of the three pillars of the SDGs. However, it has been noted in the discussions that resource-rich developing countries mostly lack capabilities for developing the technology and the human resource for applying it to enhance sustainable resource extraction. This paper, therefore, recommends that future research should assess the policy readiness of mineral resource-rich developing countries toward applying geospatial technologies on addressing sustainable mining issues. Investigations could attempt to identify if these countries have policy incentives for the use and development of geoinformation in an ever growing mineral resource development setting. Considering the scope that such an investigation would have to cover, the current paper could not have incorporated this effectively to inform readership, the scientific community and policy makers. For instance, the ARDC could be game changing in terms of access to high quality earth observation data for sustainable mining. The prospects laden in this new development need to be explored and explained in context. The objectives of this paper serve as a stimulus for advancing development and intensification of the use of these technologies, which is desirable for achieving the 2030 SDGs especially in the areas of No poverty (SDG1), Zero Hunger (SDG2), Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG6), Industry Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), Responsible consumption and Production (SDG12), Life Below Water (SDG14), Life on Land (SDG15), Peace Justice and Strong Institutions (SDG16) and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG17). A combination of data from the ARDC with pioneering works of machine learning could further be explored for the detection of illegal mining at an African Regional level. Thus, as a policy suggestion, mineral-rich developing countries could redefine their resource extraction sector policy guidelines to incorporate and take advantage of the growing geospatial technologies and their sophisticated capabilities in mapping illegal mining sites mostly located in inaccessible areas, environmental monitoring and social impact assessments. Policies could be developed to require exploration and mining companies to share data with local governments for sustainability assessment purposes. However, the policies may have to explore and embrace Public Private Partnership (PPP) for human resource development on the use and application of geospatial tools.   5 Conclusions This paper explored the extent to which geospatial technologies are being used in practical terms within the mining sector. The literature showed that geospatial data and tools are used to assess environmental and social outcomes of both legal and illegal mining operations. However, there is no evidence that geospatial technology has been applied, in a mining context, to enhance sustainable resource development. This requires a simultaneous evaluation of the triple-bottom-line (TBL), which could not be demonstrated by the literature. No earlier study has assessed this potential and the limitations laden with it towards achieving the UN Agenda 2030 SDGs. Regional, International and Research Organizations have built partnerships to bridge the technology data gaps between the world of industry and the UN's Agenda 2030 SDGs. These efforts are demonstrated in initiatives such as the GEO, GEOSS, Copernicus, and MapX. However, these initiatives do not have vested interests in observing and analyzing sustainability indicators in the mining sector. Besides, an important challenge is the accessibility of most recent and accurate geospatial data and their interpretations. Sustainability in the extractives is not just about environmental effects and social impacts. It is about linking the potential or existing effects of mining on the TBL in an area of operations; helping stakeholders visualize and interpret both interactions and changes. This potential could not be demonstrated in the literature. The findings of this paper will inform the scientific community, governments and industry on the value of geospatial technology on data generation and interpretation in the context of sustainable mining. The capacity of resource-rich countries and communities hosting mining operations to deliver on the Agenda 2030 and their own sustainability strategies is linked to the amount of trusted geospatial information available to them. Nonetheless, scientific literature on the applications of geospatial technologies for enhancing sustainable mining is woefully inadequate, especially in mineral resource-rich developing countries. This field requires an urgent attention from scientists and policy makers to fully embrace and pursue the 2030 SDG agenda.
